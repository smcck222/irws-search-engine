FT  14 NOV 94 / Arts: Sex and drugs . . . popular classics - serious music,
second-hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nation likes its classical music, but at second hand. Research suggests
that almost 30 per cent of the adult population will admit to an interest in
classical music but only about 1.4m, or 5 per cent, actually bother to go to
orchestral concerts two or more times a year.
The majority prefers to get its fix at home. The obvious alternative to
concert going is listening to recordings, and, after a worrying dip, sales
of classical CDs and tapes are expected to reach 14m this year, approaching
the 'Three Tenors-World Cup' crescendo of 16.7m in 1990. This is, however,
still only 7 per cent of all album sales.
It is two alternative sources of classical music that have caused the
biggest waves - classical radio stations and the proliferation of classical
music magazines. While the audience for orchestral concerts at the Royal
Festival Hall has fallen by 20 per cent in two decades, to around 60 per
cent of capacity, and orchestras around the country face rising deficits,
Classic FM and the BBC Music Magazine have chalked up considerable
commercial success.
By coincidence both were launched in September 1992, and both are already
the world leaders in their fields. Indeed Classic FM, with almost 5m
listeners weekly, may have the largest audience of any commercial station
playing any type of music. The BBC Music Magazine is already in profit;
Classic FM in the UK expects to be in the black very shortly.
Their success has come from quickly moving a successful domestic formula
abroad. Even before its first issue appeared the publishing director of BBC
Music Magazine received an approach from Warner Music, the direct marketing
arm of Time-Warner, which wanted to distribute the magazine in the US. Today
the Music Magazine sells around 65,000 copies in the UK; 20,000 in a new
German edition; and over 200,000 in the US.
By coincidence last month Classic FM signed a deal with Sony-Warner, a
venture between Time-Warner and Sony, which will market its programmes
across the US, guaranteeing the station a lump sum and a percentage of the
sales. Classic FM already owns, or has an interest in, classical music
stations in Holland, Finland and Sweden.
There is an intriguing paradox in the success of the Magazine and Classic
FM. BBC Music Magazine sells well, especially overseas, at least partly on
the blessed reputation of the BBC. Yet apart from carrying Radio 3 listings
(and those of Classic FM) it receives few, if any, plugs from the airwaves
of its broadcasting parent.
In contrast Classic FM is quite at liberty to promote any of its growing
number of subsidiary activities, such as its summer music festival; its
Classic FM CDs, which have shot up the classical music charts - and, next
year, its own magazine.
What they share is the inestimable advantage of the English language,
married to the universality of music. As Classic FM's chief executive, John
Spearman, says 'Mozart is not an English word'. They are also well packaged
brands which appeal to the advertisers' delight, an elusive ABC1 audience,
while avoiding any elitist pretensions.
Spearman does not expect the launch of the Classic FM magazine to greatly
affect sales of the other specialist music journals. It is aimed at a wider,
life-style market, and will cover travel and food as lavishly as music. And
it will not carry the monthly free CD attached to its cover, which has done
so much to boost sales of the BBC Music Magazine and Classic CD.
To add another twist, Classic CD has just been acquired by Pearson,
publishers of the FT, which should improve its prospects. And with The
Gramophone still going strong, the jostling field of classical music
magazines is performing surprisingly well. The same is true of BBC's Radio
3. It has, if anything, gained from the competition from Classic FM, losing
some of its remoteness, but none of its 2.5m weekly listeners.
So while many members of the nation's leading symphony orchestras face yet
another year without a pay rise, and a future which may well see the end of
at least one orchestra, the parasites who live off the creative talent of
musicians prosper. This is the way the world is going as the media
increasingly acts as the selective retailer of culture. At least both
Classic FM and the BBC Music Magazine take their responsibilities towards
their art form seriously.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Safety row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
USAir has allowed jets to leave gates without enough fuel at least nine
times and once used a jet for 13 days despite a dangerous crack on its wing
flap, the New York Times reported at the weekend. Despite assurances from
USAir and federal officials, a two-month review of the airline showed
numerous safety and training problems, it said.
In one incident, the pilots of a Washington-to-Boston flight did not check
to see if the aircraft had enough fuel. When forced to land at La Guardia
airport, New York, they lied and radioed the control tower that they had to
land because of engine trouble. Afterwards, the captain admitted there had
been no engine trouble.
On September 8 a USAir Boeing 737 crashed near Pittsburgh international
airport, killing all 132 aboard. Last July a USAir jet crashed in Charlotte,
North Carolina, in a thunderstorm, killing 37 of 57 people aboard. USAir
executives told the newspaper the accidents were not connected and there was
no reason to draw negative conclusions about safety.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia is sticking to its promise to sweep the normally teeming streets
of Jakarta clean of transvestites, prostitutes, street vendors and beggars
in honour of the Apec summit.
Transvestites and prostitutes have been chased off the streets while
vendors' food carts have been barred from the city centre. On-the-spot
push-ups are being revived as punishment for jaywalking, though there have
been no reports of foreign visitors being ordered to do push-ups. An
American oil executive recently panicked when a transvestite dived into his
car. Only after much shouting and 50,000 rupiah (Dollars 22) later could the
oilman drive off unaccompanied.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Zaventem revamp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brussels airport opens its new terminal building on December 11, completing
a Dollars 674m revamp of an airport long criticised as outdated. The new
terminal will raise the airport's capacity to 15m passengers annually, and
'will be one of the most beautiful and modern airport buildings', an
official says.
For years, Zaventem airport has been the butt of jokes, with long queues
irritating passengers at the 40-year-old terminal building. Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene described Zaventem last year as 'a rather provincial
airport' in serious need of renovation. Passenger numbers have doubled to
more than 10m a year, and Sabena, the national airline, wants Zaventem to be
a Euro-hub for business travel.
The first stage of the modernisation and extension of the airport - a
section of the new departure hall, a portion of the arrivals area and a new
baggage-handling system - was opened last June. The project, initially
budgeted at Dollars 257m, was started at the end of 1989 and was due to be
unveiled at the end of 1992. It is supported by the state and private
companies.

FT  14 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Two outsiders for Bell Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bell Canada is a rare breed among the regulated monopolies which have been
plunged into free-for-all competition, writes Bernard Simon.
Canada's biggest telephone company has met its rivals head on, to the point
where this once-bureaucratic behemoth is quickly gaining a reputation as an
agile, forward-looking animal.
The transformation is reflected in a recent management shake-up. Bell, which
is wholly-owned by BCE, the Montreal-based telecoms conglomerate, has
reached outside its own ranks to fill two top jobs. Ian McElroy, 44, takes
over as chief executive of a new 'competitive services' division, which will
include sales to large customers and long-distance services, which were
deregulated in 1992.
For the past year, McElroy has been president of BCE Mobile Communications,
which includes BCE's cellular telephone interests. Most of his career before
that was spent with IBM's Canadian subsidiary, where he rose to
vice-president for system operations.
John MacDonald, 41, previously chief executive of NBTel, New Brunswick's
telephone company, was named executive vice-president for business
development and chief technology officer, with responsibility for such areas
as multimedia and advanced intelligent network services.
MacDonald, whose business card includes his electronic mail and Internet
sign-ons, has helped turn NBTel into one of North America's most innovative
telephone companies.
Announcing the latest appointments, John McLennan, Bell's chief executive,
reiterated that 'anyone who wants to take our customers away from us is in
for the fight of their lives. We're not going to concede anything to
anyone.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Spielvogel's third career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Predictability is not Carl Spielvogel's strong suit, writes Richard Tomkins.
Three weeks ago he astonished Madison Avenue by quitting Bates Worldwide,
the US advertising agency he co-founded. Now he has raised eyebrows still
further with the announcement that, at the age of 65, he is starting a new
career as a car dealer.
With effect from last week, Spielvogel has become chairman and chief
executive of United Auto Group, a company set up in 1992 to buy and run auto
dealerships around the US. According to one trade magazine, it is already
the eighth largest auto dealership group in the US.
The latest move launches Spielvogel into his third career. His first,
spanning 10 years, was as a journalist with The New York Times, where he
became the paper's first advertising columnist.
In 1960, he left the paper for the advertising industry, later setting up
Backer &amp; Spielvogel with Bill Backer in 1979. The company was eventually
bought by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and merged with Ted Bates Worldwide, at which
point Spielvogel's name dropped from the title.
When Spielvogel (below) resigned as chairman of Bates Worldwide last month,
many thought it was in protest at interference in the company's business by
the parent company's British executives. But it now emerges that he was
serious when he spoke of pursuing another career.
Spielvogel says the switch is not as odd as it might look. 'The automobile
business has been short of marketing,' he says. 'Recently John Smale, the
former head of Procter &amp; Gamble, became chairman of General Motors, and you
wouldn't exactly call him an automobile man; yet he is bringing contemporary
marketing techniques to the automobile business. I intend to do the same.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Jardines recruits locally in
Manila
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippine branch of Jardine Matheson has a reputation as a training
ground for future Taipans of the 132-year-old Hong Kong trading giant,
writes Jose Galang. Alasdair Morrison, Jardine's current managing director,
once worked there, as did his predecessor, Nigel Rich, who now runs
Trafalgar House. Percy Weatherall, the boss of Hongkong Land, and Simon
Michel, another senior Jardine figure, also learnt their trade in Jardine's
Manila office on Buendia Avenue.
Hence the surprise at the appointment of Aloysius Borja Colayco, 44, as head
of Jardine Davies, the group's locally-quoted subsidiary. Not only is he the
first Filipino to lead the group but he has been brought in from outside and
given the job of chairman and chief executive. Although a few other foreign
multinationals such as Shell and Caltex have had Filipino chief executives,
it is a big departure for Jardines and suggests that it is intent on
revitalising one of the sleepier parts of its far-flung trading empire.
Colayco is not the most obvious candidate to run a business whose activities
range from traditional sugar milling to merchant banking, insurance broking,
construction materials, and hotel operations. Most of his career has been
spent working in the international insurance industry. He was president of
New York-based AIG Investment Corporation, which manages AIG's investment
portfolios in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other regions outside north
America.
However, Colayco is not a complete stranger. In 1980 he joined Jardine
Davies as assistant treasurer and was transferred a year later to the
group's head office in Hong Kong before moving to be chief investment
officer of Philippine American Life Insurance, part of AIG, the US insurance
giant. Jardine's decision to poach him back suggests that - in the unlikely
event of Jardine choosing an Asian Taipan - Colayco would have to feature as
a contender.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: The code few people can crack - An airline
practice that is worrying some passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILY JUSTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not so long ago that the phrase 'airline code-share' crept into use.
A consumer-oriented magazine uncovered the practice and suggested it was
misleading; airlines went on the defensive; industry trade bodies applied
pressure; and the victims - air travellers - grappled with the new concept.
Airline code-sharing is a simple process. It is when two airlines use a
single flight designator - or flight number - to market a through service.
It can mean that while you are booked on one airline you can unexpectedly
end up making part of your journey on another airline.
Travel agents have difficulty discovering whether a flight is code-shared or
not. Not all airline computer reservation systems highlight the practice
early enough in their listings. As a result, booking agents, always under
pressure to get the job done, often do not warn passengers of what is in
store for them.
The oft-used example was the code-sharing arrangement between Emirates and
Cyprus Airways. If you booked Emirates' flight EK 407 from Dubai to Larnaca
you did not fly with Emirates. Rather, you flew Cyprus Airways, whose
European-style business class does not match the long-haul comforts offered
by Emirates' business class. However, this particular arrangement was ended
last week.
There is less controversy among industry pressure groups if the two airlines
that are code-sharing offer travellers comparable standards. But if they
clearly offer different quality and safety standards, passengers are being
deceived.
If Joe Public books with Airline A in a modern aircraft type, but flies on
part of the route with inferior-standard Airline B on an older, less
well-cared-for aircraft, there are obviously grounds for complaint.
Code-sharing is a worrying trend because its use has spread throughout the
airline industry and to all big carriers. Even British Airways code-shares
with its US partner, USAir. If you book a BA transatlantic ticket and an
onward domestic US leg, you will cross the Atlantic on BA but the US leg
will be on USAir.
The advantage to airlines is being able to expand route networks with
minimal outlay. Instead of competing against one another on the same route,
two airlines operate the route jointly.
It's not all negative for travellers. There are some advantages. Your
baggage is booked through to your final destination; you need only one
ticket; and, because of the linking of frequent-flyer programmes, you may
want to choose a code-share flight to maximise rewards.
As airlines increasingly link with partner airlines to increase their muscle
in the marketplace, the code-share trend is set to continue.
Business Traveller magazine exposed the practice last March. The Air
Transport Users Council (AUC) was on the case, too, and now, belatedly,
bodies such as the Guild of Business Travel Agents (GBTA) are jumping on
board to express discontent. Passengers' rights are being defended.
'Things are looking up,' says Tony Hockley of the AUC. 'Airlines are making
sure it doesn't backfire on them and that their passengers' goodwill isn't
lost. I can't believe that any airline would willingly deceive its
customers. You can only deceive them once, and they certainly don't want
disgruntled passengers.'
British Airways now prints on its tickets the name of the airline operating
its services, while KLM and Lufthansa also tell their passengers that they
are travelling on a code-share flight. United has always placed an itinerary
card on the front of all its tickets listing the carriers operating its
flights.
American Airlines was the first carrier to come out publicly against
code-sharing, calling it 'basically deceptive'. But American continues to
code-share as it feels obliged to match competitors' tactics.
At a conference last month, Hans Mirka, a senior American Airlines
vice-president, listed several reasons for opposing code-sharing. Among
them: it deceives customers, who are promised one thing and given another;
it is 'profoundly anti-competitive', since it creates combinations between
former competitors which diminish meaningful price and product competition;
and it will 'certainly discourage independent carriers'.
The US Department of Transportation is proposing a piece of legislation to
clear up the lack of disclosure. Current rules stipulate that a travel agent
selling a ticket should tell the customer about code-sharing. But a survey
revealed that only 30 per cent of passengers were being informed that they
were booked on a code-share flight. In Europe, the EU is considering the
issue.
The onus is now on travel agents to inform passengers and to take more time
to establish whether flights are code-shared or not. Computer reservation
systems such as Sabre, Gallileo and Apollo do have the correct information,
but it often surfaces on screen only after many promptings.
The GBTA set up a lobbying group some weeks ago. What it wants is complete
transparency on code-sharing. 'The industry is at fault,' says GBTA chairman
David Reynolds. 'You can't pin it (solely) on the computer reservation
systems or the airlines. They're both at fault.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / People: 'No one is better than the British at sorting out
chaos' - Perhaps, suggests Michael Thompson-Noel, it would be better if
trains through Sir Alastair Morton's tunnel were to run late - just at first
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
This ought to be a good week for Britain. But ought is a big word.
Today, tickets go on sale for Britain's first national lottery since 1826: a
world-class tombola (the first draw is on Saturday) which is likely to gush
geysers of cash for various good causes and to spread happiness throughout
the land.
And today, by coincidence, the first fare-paying passengers are due to step
aboard high-speed Eurostar trains for the start of services linking Britain
to continental Europe via the Channel Tunnel.
Two grand projects. Fun and cheer for all. A lottery which is expected to
become one of the world's biggest, and a macro-engineering coup that will
anchor Britain a little more securely to its European neighbours at a time
when Europe's centre of gravity is drifting eastward.
Yet in Britain there is only tepid celebration. Instead, a fit of mockery is
waiting to burst forth if either of these great projects fluffs its debut.
In theory, accidents or cock-ups are unlikely to afflict the lottery.
Lotteries are easy to establish, simple to operate. You turn on the tap; out
comes the money. But the Channel Tunnel represents state-of-the-art
macro-construction at the tail-end of the 20th century  - complex,
sophisticated and a devourer, to date, of mountains of investors' money.
In Britain, the approach to today's start of commercial Eurostar services
has been signalled by an escalation of chortling and whingeing  - scare
stories about safety; further criticisms of the financial predicament of
Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French private-sector company which designed,
financed, built and will operate the tunnel; and gleeful accounts of
'embarrassing' breakdowns and faults.
However, most of this will have been water off a duck's back to Sir Alastair
Morton, 56, co-chairman of Eurotunnel and the man who has carried the weight
of Eurotunnel controversies since 1987.
He was born in Johannesburg, educated in South Africa and at Oxford
University (law), and then joined De Beers, the diamond monopoly. After that
his career included the World Bank, the British National Oil Corporation and
financial group Guinness Peat.
Morton has always been renowned for his toughness and 'frightening
belligerence' - qualities no doubt essential when dealing with governments,
banks, contractors and rail companies while breathing life into a project
like the tunnel, but ones that do not reveal themselves across the
lunch-table. He exudes forcefulness and confidence - not a man to interrupt
 -though he can be curiously softly-spoken, so that you have to lean
forward.
I met him at Luigi's, an Italian restaurant he likes because he can walk
there from his central London office. He was late. He apologised. I said it
was not a problem; his secretary had rung the restaurant. He had been
delayed, he explained, by the media. There had been a leak about something
in Paris which was causing movement in the share price. 'I had to calm
things down.'
I asked him whether he had had his fill of journalists. He smiled through
bared teeth. 'Yes,' he said, 'you could say I was pretty fed up with the
press. Not that I take it personally. It's the tunnel, of course. It's big
and it's assertive and it satisfies the need in Britain - in fact it's an
English thing - to mock, a need to express contrariness.
'It has always been that way. England's national motto is: 'There'll be
trouble if you do that'. The exception was North Sea oil, but that was
because it involved American oilmen. The ability of Eurotunnel to make money
has always been questioned, but only by the City of London.
'I have got used to the fact that adverse or negative news affecting
Eurotunnel is seized upon, whereas what might prove to be good news - such
as improved traffic forecasts - gets virtually no attention.'
I asked Morton what was special about the Channel Tunnel that attracted this
treatment. 'Well,' he said, 'first, it's a tunnel - not a bridge, which is
glamorous, romantic and liberating. Second, it's a fixed link between
England and the continent. Third, there's its size. The feeling is that it's
a big project that will come to no good. It has a few fans in Britain:
businessmen, for example, who can see five years ahead, and engineers. But
the tunnel has to contend with a great deal of bias.
'In France it's different. The French like their big projects, their
rockets, the Airbus, their motorways, their grande vitesse trains and
nuclear power. The difference is this: in France, the man in the street
believes that as a result of big projects his grandchildren will lead a
better life.'
Did he regret taking on the tunnel? 'No, I knew it would be large,
complicated and organisational. I saw it as a major economic development
that was very necessary. The great thing I didn't bargain for was a voyage
through the English psyche.'
I had read, I said, that history's grandest macro-engineering projects, such
as the pyramids, had always depended on absolute political support at the
very top. Was that true of the tunnel? Would history see Margaret Thatcher
and Francois Mitterand as its heroes?
'For Mitterand,' said Morton, 'the tunnel was a means to an end: the
resurrection of derelict northern France. Conversely, Mrs Thatcher said at
the outset that the tunnel would be done by private enterprise or not at all
 -and after that said nothing.'
The Eurotunnel boss seems surprised - even now - at the frigidity of
Britain's attitude towards the rest of Europe. 'There is no sense I can
detect of people in Britain saying that because they have joined Europe
economically they should be doing things like the tunnel to integrate
themselves more fully. Britain backs into the future grumbling and
grudgingly. On the other hand, the genius of Britain is the way it copes
with adverse circumstances.
'The British are reactive, not creative, whereas the French plan. A French
engineer will tell you that he cannot start work without a plan. But plans
can fail. There is no one better than the British at sorting out the
resultant chaos.'
On that basis, perhaps the best thing for the Channel Tunnel and for the
national lottery would be a few spectacular cock-ups, preferably this week.
There would be dancing in the streets - and then a brilliant British rescue.
For all anyone knows, that may even be the plan. (See Leader page)

FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Microchips on the Paris metro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Paris metro commuter rail network is testing an advanced ticketing
system that uses a plastic card, embedded with a microchip, battery and tiny
antenna, that need never leave your pocket or purse.
The card - about the size of a credit card, though a little thicker - is
being tested between the Chatelet stop in central Paris and the suburb of
Les Lilas, officials of the Paris Transport Authority said. It has been
designed for use on 2,900km of bus routes and the metro's full 201km.
The system is being developed by Roland Moreno, the Paris-based inventor of
France's electronic banking and public telephone systems, which rely on
microchip-equipped cards.
The current system, used by some 4.3m travellers daily, relies on paper
tickets with magnetic strips. But that system is near its end and is plagued
by fraud.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Business Travel: An hour to spare - Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You are in Glasgow, with an hour between meetings. What to do?
Dr William Hunter has an assured place in medical history as a famous
obstetrician and the first great teacher of anatomy in Britain. Even Adam
Smith, Edmund Burke and Edward Gibbon went to his lectures. His wide-ranging
collections of specimens, coins and medals, and his fine library of books
and manuscripts, have enriched the University of Glasgow, while his
paintings form the nucleus of the Hunterian Art Gallery, one of the choicest
of all university collections.
Thanks are due to the doctor for the three magnificent paintings by the
incomparably subtle Jean-Simeon Chardin: A Lady Taking Tea, The Cellar Boy
and The Scullery Maid. But the real strength of the Hunterian focuses on the
turn of this century, and the influential Glasgow architect and designer
Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the American-born artist James McNeill
Whistler.
The windows and front door from the long-demolished Mackintosh House in
Glasgow were incorporated into the facade of the new museum in 1980, and its
four principal interiors carefully reconstructed as Mackintosh originally
conceived them. Bequests of furniture and other applied arts, drawings and
designs have made the museum the pre-eminent Mackintosh archive.
The Whistler holding - the contents of his studio at his death - comprises
some 80 oils, including 11 full-length portraits, 120 pastels and several
hundred prints and drawings. Its only rival is the Freer Gallery in
Washington.

FT  14 NOV 94 / FT Guide To US Interest Rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Why is everyone so sure that US interest rates are going up tomorrow?
The Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets interest rate policy for the
US Federal Reserve, meets tomorrow in Washington for the first time in
nearly two months. It has raised interest rates five times this year, most
recently on August 16, in an effort to control an economy that grew at an
annualised rate of 4.1 per cent in the second quarter and to head off
inflationary pressures before they had a chance to show up as higher prices.
Since then, it has become clear that the US economy is still growing much
faster than the 2 1/2 per cent pace that most members of the FOMC would
regard as sustainable - a 3.4 per cent rate in the third quarter. The
unemployment rate is down to 5.8 per cent - at or below the level at which
most FOMC members expect employers will start having difficulty finding
workers and having to pay higher wages - and some commodity prices are
rising fast. As a result, virtually everyone agrees that the Fed needs to
pour another jug of cold water on the economy in the form of higher interest
rates.
Who makes the decision?
The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the board of governors, who are
appointed by the president for a 14-year term, and a rotating sample of five
of the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. The committee is
chaired by Alan Greenspan (below), and its vice chairman is the president of
the New York Fed. Traditionally, the regional Fed presidents are viewed as
more hawkish on inflation than the governors, but they are also in closer
contact with the business community in their districts, from whom they are
hearing plenty of reasons why not to raise interest rates.
How do they decide?
Like other central banks, the Fed once used the growth of the money supply
as a target, but changes in the structure of the economy mean that monetary
measures like M1 and M2 no longer have any demonstrable use as a predictor
of inflation. Inflation measures, such as the consumer price index, tell you
more about the past than the future, and also overstate the pace of
inflation, many Fed economists argue. Now, the FOMC basically makes a
forecast of where it thinks the economy is heading, using a wide and
shifting range of indicators such as credit market developments,
manufacturers' order books and lead times, and tightens or loosens its
policy accordingly. One critical element is what Fed officials call the
'loss factor' - how easily can they undo the damage if their forecast turns
out to be wrong? That argues for a series of smaller interest rate increases
rather than one sharp yank on the monetary rope.
How does the Fed move interest rates?
To raise interest rates, the Fed operates in the credit market to take cash
out of the system by selling government securities to the banks. It would
undertake a reserve repurchase, selling government securities to the money
market for a fixed period, usually one day, with an agreement to buy them
back at a fixed interest rate. By reducing the amount of money available,
this raises the interest rate banks can charge for the reserves they hold at
the Federal Reserve and lend each other overnight - the federal funds rate,
which currently stands at 4.75 per cent. The Fed can also raise the discount
rate, currently 4 per cent, which it charges when banks borrow directly from
its discount window - designed to operate mostly as a lender of last resort.
So what exactly is going to happen tomorrow?
Of the 39 banks which operate as primary dealers in the government
securities market, 34 are predicting an increase of half a percentage point,
or 50 basis points in the language used by bond traders, lifting the federal
funds rate to 5.25 per cent. Only one dealer is predicting no change,
according to a survey by Dow Jones Capital Markets, while four banks expect
an increase of three quarters of a percentage point. Almost everyone in the
financial markets would like a move of more than half a percentage point - a
view not shared by business. Most dealers think the Fed has been 'behind the
curve' in not acting sooner to cool the rapid growth of the third quarter.
The markets could be placated if the Fed raises the discount rate by more
than the federal funds rate, or issues a tough statement on its
determination to keep inflation under control.
When will we know?
In the past, the FOMC has not made its actions known immediately. It gave
the Fed chairman his orders, but left him to act in the open markets between
FOMC meetings. This year, however, the FOMC has announced all its interest
rate moves, and even given a brief explanation, usually around lunchtime,
Washington time.

SNOOKER: November 11 to 27, Royal Liver Assurance UK Championships, Guild
Hall, Preston.
The fight for the British title gets into full swing this week with the
bookmakers making Scotland's Stephen Hendry 2-1 favourite to take the Pounds
70,000 first prize. Ronnie O'Sullivan won the title last year, to become the
youngest-ever winner of a world-ranking event. At 5-1, he is second
favourite this time round and reckons the bookies have things about right.
In October, Ronnie, now 18, was voted Player of the Year, but says: 'Stephen
Hendry probably deserved it as much as me. He is still the one to beat.'
FOOTBALL: November 16, England v Nigeria, Wembley. European Championship
qualifying matches include: Northern Ireland v Republic of Ireland; Georgia
v Wales and Scotland v Russia.
When it comes to the football side of life, the biggest problem facing
England manager Terry Venables is finding good-quality opposition to test
his side in preparation for the 1996 European Championship finals. Romania
was a tough game, the USA a cakewalk and Nigeria should fit in somewhere
between those two. Still no place for Pounds 5m Chris Sutton up front, and
the Sutton v Collymore v Cole v Fowler debate rages on. Scotland manager
Craig Brown has named uncapped players John Spencer (Chelsea's Lion of
Vienna), Gerry Creaney (Portsmouth) and Darren Jackson (Hibernian) in his
squad to face Russia.
RUGBY UNION: Scotland v South Africa, November 19, Murrayfield
At Twickenham in 1969 everyone lost their heads. The demonstrators lost
their's, enraged by the regime that the touring South Africans represented.
And the Springboks lost their's, for in those days 'losing your head' was
the term used to describe the first defeat of the tour. Oxford won that day
and so, in the end, did the anti-apartheid movement. Now, on the first South
African rugby tour to Britain for 25 years, heads have again been lost all
round: first in the bloodbath at Neath, and then (in the traditional sense)
last Wednesday, when the Boks went down 17-15 in injury time to Scotland A.
That will have given the Scottish first team a confidence boost. But the
tourists are still very clear favourites.
RUGBY LEAGUE: Great Britain v Australia, November 20, the 3rd John Smith's
Test, Elland Road, Leeds.
The third and final Test of the series is one that the Kangaroos should and
probably will win, following their surprise defeat at Wembley and an easy
victory over the Lions at Old Trafford.

Two of the best female voices in rock bring out greatest hits collections
this week. Tina Turner celebrates three decades of chart success with The
Collected Recordings: Sixties to Nineties (EMI/Capitol), a three-CD set
which includes rare recordings from every period of her career. Listening to
the set from beginning-to-end reminds one of how superior her early material
was to the blander songs written for her in the 1980s, when she enjoyed a
remarkable renaissance. The less famous but arguably more influential Donna
Summer also looks back nostalgically with Endless Summer - the Very Best of
Donna Summer (Mercury), featuring highlights from her 20-year career, from
the provocative Love to Love You Baby to the highly intelligent versions of
On the Radio and State of Independence.
Having been rather left out of the rush of cross-over artists releasing
album after album of pleasant, tuneful melodies, Julie Andrews makes her own
measured response with Broadway - the Music of Richard Rogers (Philips),
which includes new versions of her most famous material: The Sound of Music,
Edelweiss and My Funny Valentine. The voice seems in good nick, but it all
sounds distinctly stocking-filler-for-granny to me.
Many punters over the age of 11 will be pleased to see the return to fashion
of the three-minute, melodic English pop song. The latest example of the
genre is Dodgy's new album, Homegrown (A&amp;M), full of bright tunes and a
light, feel-good touch which repays a listen.
The choir of King's College, Cambridge, directed by Stephen Cleobury,
tackles the work of three of the most religious composers of the 20th
century on Ikos (EMI). The pieces, by Henryk Gorecki, Arvo Part and John
Tavener, are proof that we do not need to go back to Gregorian chants to
find spirituality in music.
Two of the rarer operas in the repertoire, both with eastern European
connections, get an airing this week. On the Marco Polo label, Antoni Wit
conducts the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra for Karol
Szymanowski's King Roger, while on Philips, Valery Gergiev and the Kirov
Orchestra and Opera perform a live version of Rimsky-Korsakov's Sadko.
Finally, the Christmas present from hell. I can only give it to you
straight: James Last and Richard Clayderman perform a selection of popular
tunes including Love is All Around, I Will Always Love You and (gulp)
Streets of Philadelphia on In Harmony (Polydor). There.

Environmental soundness has come to cinema in recent years. When in doubt,
recycle. This week should have seen the opening in London of Natural Born
Killers, but the censor decided it was too mad, bad, violent and new.
So we have revivals of My Fair Lady (no serial murders) and Bicycle Thieves
(non-violent vehicle robbery), plus a lavish, no-brain Hollywood adventure
drawn from a 1930s radio serial: The Shadow has Alec Baldwin prowling
through New York in a hat and cape, righting wrongs and fighting wicked
Orientals. Racist subtext? Never mind. At least there is no real blood or
real emotion being spilled over your popcorn.
On video, too, Aunt Edna may breathe freely in the run-up to Christmas. We
have a mixture of innocent fun - Cool Runnings, with its comedy re-enactment
of the Jamaican bobsleigh team's glory week at the 1988 Olympics - and
erratic attempts at grown-up entertainment.
The Paper, starring Michael Keaton and Glenn Close, is a brisk, caustic
newspaper yarn after The Front Page. And Ken Loach's blithe comedy of
working-class doldrums, Raining Stones, comes to the retail shelves.
If you fancy a movie of that hit stage play about transvestite passion, M.
Butterfly, you may not fancy it after seeing David Cronenberg's version.
John Lone - mascara, kimono and rugger-player shoulders - makes a less than
convincing woman, and Jeremy Irons as the love-struck consul fades into the
cod-Chinese scenery.
The best place to be is once more the London Film Festival. The final week
offers you two curious and wonderful tales of sex and soul-searching. From
Canada, Atom Egoyan's Exotica (Wednesday) is a mazy mind-melodrama, shot in
a nightclub resembling a human aquarium. And from Taiwan, Tsai Ming-liang's
Vive L'Amour, the 1994 Venice Golden Lion winner, maroons two youths and a
girl in an untenanted apartment and watches their fantasies singly and
collectively explode.
Dangerous and original movies. Happily, the censor exercises no sway over
the LFF. So for two precious weeks each year grown-up moviegoers have a
place to go and be grown-up.

If our heads were screwed on we wouldn't have our feet planted so firmly in
the arms industry. That, in simple form, is the argument made by campaigning
journalist John Pilger in Network First (Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm, ITV).
Pilger, who reduced the world to shocked silence when he came out of
Cambodia with pictures of skulls piled upon skulls, turns to polemic with a
piece that looks at our dependence on weapons manufacturing (it soaks up 50
per cent of Britain's R&amp;D budget and employs 10 per cent of its workers). He
talks to the men who turn a blind eye when weapons are sold to our enemies.
Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.15-1.25am, BBC1), the leading arts series, devotes a
two-hour special to Pink Floyd. The programme will trace how a pop band with
a pop image became the exact antithesis as a result of deaths and drug
abuse. Pink Floyd have been credited with the first concept album and
producing the most spectacular concerts. There will be a
chance to assess the latter with footage from the group's sell-out concerts.
Last year the parish church of Yately in Hampshire saw the arrival of 1,500
mourners for the funeral of 28-year-old Sean Devereux, an aid worker in
Somalia, who was killed after criticising the local war lords, as well as
the US marines then stationed there. Peter Kosminsky, who made Shoot To Kill
and The Falklands War, directs The Dying Of The Light (Wednesday,
8.00-10.00pm, ITV).
The Trial (Friday, 9.00-9.50pm, BBC2) is an engrossing look at legal
procedures. It is as gripping as any court-room drama, with an added frisson
because it is unscripted. This opening programme follows a murder trial and
tails the accused into the subterranean chambers below the courtroom when he
talks to his counsel. The series required much smooth-talking; the producer
even volunteered to play for the Law Society football team.
In 1566, Elizabeth I announced a national lottery to renovate English ports,
but it is not recorded who hosted the draw. Four centuries later, it is
impossible to escape the brouhaha surrounding the draw for The National
Lottery Live (Saturday, 7.00-8.00pm, BBC1), hosted by Noel Edmonds.
ITV isn't taking any chances. It has scheduled its main attraction of the
evening, Diana: Portrait Of A Princess (Saturday, 8.00-9.00pm, ITV), to
start after Edmonds has finished. The Princess Of Wales has allowed the
cameras to follow her for nine months; interestingly, the deal was struck
weeks after she announced that she was withdrawing from public life.

Boxing desperately awaits the second coming. Next spring, prisoner No 922335
leaves the Indiana Youth Detention Centre: Mike Tyson will be back on the
street and quickly into the ring.
'I'm sure he'll fight within six to eight weeks of getting out,' predicts
Frank Warren, the London fight promoter. 'He's below his fighting weight, in
the gym every day, and his attitude is good.' When Warren tells you that
Tyson's return to the ring is going to be a mega-industry and that his
comeback fight could gross Dollars 100m on pay-per-view TV alone, it is
probably best to ignore the numbers.
Warren does, after all, have the UK TV rights to shift, and is a consummate
salesman. He is also honest and intelligent enough to admit that boxing at
present has a massive credibility problem.
George Foreman, a sweating, heaving, 46-year-old tub of lard, is
re-annointed world heavyweight champion in Las Vegas. In Hong Kong,
promoters wrangle, boxers such as Frank Bruno stand idle, and a whole show
goes down for lack of honest interest. Most bizarre of all, Chris Eubank,
dressed like a character in an Ealing comedy, struts around the world
fighting no-hopers and telling the tiny crowds they will be seeing nothing
special since he hates to fight.
His manager, Barry Hearn, an accountant turned snooker impresario, has sold
Eubank's 10-fight sequence to Sky TV for Pounds 10m. So far the broadcaster
has received only poor ratings and ridicule. 'It's a joke. Hearn took Kelvin
McKenzie for a well-deserved ride. Pounds 10m quid down the drain,' laughs
Warren. McKenzie was briefly joint head of BSkyB after leaving the
editorship of The Sun. But Warren hates the damage this kind of fiasco does
to a sport that is also a way of life. 'Eubank thinks he's clever to knock
boxing, thinks it's what the public want to hear. But look at Gerald Ratner.
He lost his money, his job, his family company just by insulting the
customer. It's no different to Eubank telling the crowd he's going to give
them a crap fight.'
I went to see Warren to test a theory that boxing's real problem is not the
sportsmen but the dilettante promoters who are taking it over, drawn by the
potent mixture of blood and money. The notion came to me when I saw film
producer John Daly (The Last Emperor and Platoon) trying to patch up the
Hong Kong show he'd dreamt up. It became a nightmare. Not a punch was thrown
(at least not in the ring).
'It's Vietnam here,' said a distraught Daly in the colony's Ritz Carlton
Hotel, under siege from creditors, hoteliers and fighters. 'Basically, I
just want to get out alive.' Five years ago I met Daly in Hollywood. The
Oscar for Last Emperor sat on his desk. We drove to the Polo Lounge in his
Mercedes sports soft-top and it was all 'Hi John' from the stars at lesser
tables. But what he really wanted to talk about wasn't movies but Ali v
Foreman in Zaire, 15 years earlier.
Daly had been a player in the 'Rumble in the Jungle' promotion, and he
always remembered it. Daly's partner in the Hong King venture was American
promoter Bob Arum, a Harvard lawyer who was once an adviser to the Kennedys,
was sent in to investigate boxing - and became a player.
In contrast to the respectability of Arum is the fear and loathing with
which Don King is regarded - mistakely, says Warren, who often acts as the
Harlem preacher's London connection. 'If Don had run that fiasco in Hong
Kong he'd have been crucified by the media, yet the Hollywood guys, the
lawyers and the accountants, weaselled their way out of it, keeping their
so-called integrity.'
Unsettling those around him is undoubtedly part of King's business
technique, along with the flamboyant hair and the costumes. In Kinshasa he
turned up at the 1974 fight in African robes. 'If King put on a show in
Alaska, he'd turn out with a sleigh and dogs,' said one observer at the
Foreman comeback fight.
Yet King delivers, for the audience and the boxers. 'Don's an easy target,'
says Warren. 'He's black, he's loud, he's been to prison. But I'll bet he's
made more black millionaires than anybody else in sport.' King also has a
terrific grasp of the big picture, which the clowning often obscures.
Between 1987 and 1992, when King virtually ran the big-time heavyweight
division, there was a unified championship. Tyson was The Man. Since then it
has fragmented into three different titles (four if one counts the peculiar
WBO title).
Lennox Lewis came as near as anyone this century to providing Britain with
an undisputed world heavyweight champion. His talent was never in doubt. But
American connections like Dan Duva and a London promoter who had never been
to a boxing match until three years ago, combined in a bonfire of naivety to
prevent Lewis unifying the title. Following his knock-out by Oliver McCall
two months ago, he may never get the chance.
Six months from now, boxing will probably be very different to the muddled,
laughable scene we have now. Tyson faces no worthwhile opposition, and King
and Warren will cut bigger deals on his success and celebrity than every
before. 'We're going to keep the accountants and dabblers out of this,'
promised Warren.
It is time for the gentlemen to get out of the players' way.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Europe 'heads for crisis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<TEXT>
Europe's telecommunications companies are heading for a productivity crisis
which will hamper their efforts to compete effectively in tomorrow's
information society, according to a leading US-based technology expert.
Eric Benhamou, who chairs the American Electronics Association's national
information infrastructure task-force which is assessing the implications of
multimedia and the information superhighway, said that Europe lagged behind
not only the US but even developing economies like China in its approach to
the information society.
He warned that Europe's telecommunications costs were too high and the
productivity of its workers too low - leading to a vicious cycle which was
hurting the competitiveness of European companies and reducing their ability
to grow and create jobs.
Benhamou, chief executive of the US networking company 3Com, was speaking at
an AEA meeting in Brussels last week. Complaining that European telecoms
costs are still two to three times higher than in the US, he warned that
Europe must cut prices to stimulate market growth and create a virtuous
cycle where industrial productivity would lead to new jobs and industries.
He said Europe had to match or undercut US prices immediately and in one
drastic move, or risk 'death by 1,000 cuts'.
He said regulations requiring manufacturers of telecommunications equipment
to gain approval for their products in each European country were
'regulatory sabotage', arguing that one country should have the authority to
approve telecommunications equipment through the EU.
By comparison, China had a pragmatic approach to building its information
infrastructure. It was developing four major 'golden projects' - networks
covering public economic information, national foreign trade, national
finance and the value-added tax management system. 'These projects will
interconnect 30-40 provincial capitals and about 500 cities to create an
information superstructure for China's government and industry. Their
efforts in education alone will add 20m nodes to the Internet to enable work
in research and education.'
In the US, surveys indicated that support for building a national
information infrastructure was based on a belief that it would benefit
business efficiency first, followed by business competitiveness.
Entertainment came well down the list despite the media concentration on
video-on-demand and computer games.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Architectire: The picture at Bankside / A look at short-list
contenders for the Tate conversion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a week to go before the announcement of the short list of
architects from which will be chosen the designer for the conversion of
Bankside power station, near London's Southwark Bridge, into the Tate
Gallery of Modern Art. This is an important international competition - one
that will have a profound effect on the style of public museums and
galleries in the future.
So far the competition has been an extraordinary affair - a mixture of good
intentions and inevitable confusion. It was a brave idea to open the
competition to architects from around the world. Contemporary architecture
is an international activity, as is the building of new museums, but it is
unusual for competitions to be so open and all-embracing.
When a selection committee opens a competition to all-comers it is usually
in the hope that they will be able to spot a new discovery, an untried
talent, a genius who will change the contours on the architectural map. This
is exactly how the original architect of Bankside power station, Sir Giles
Gilbert Scott, was discovered.
He achieved sudden and early fame by winning the competition for Liverpool's
Anglican cathedral in 1904, when he was only 24. He was to go on to create
Battersea power station in 1932, which became the model for so many brick
giants all over England. By the time he was consultant architect for
Bankside he was close to death, and died in 1960 - just before Bankside
opened.
The symmetry of Bankside is striking, with its 325ft-high central chimney
(the station was designed to burn oil, not coke) and its immaculate
brickwork. Inside, the great spaces are a challenge to any architect, and
they are clearly going to be expensive to convert and even more expensive to
maintain.
The competition attracted 148 architects. Applicants for the first stage
were examined only on the evidence of a few slides and a brief written
submission. Because an open competition is so random, many of these early
entrants had little or no museum experience. It has to be remembered that
many of the best architects in the world are reluctant to enter such wild
competitions.
The finest architect in Britain, Sir Norman Foster, for example, is not even
being considered for Bankside. Many architects - I suspect Sir Norman is
among them - will feel as I do that it is sad that the first major building
in Britain devoted to the art of the 20th and 21st centuries should be a
conversion of a large, but not that distinguished, redundant industrial
building.
The 13 architects on the long short list have presented a mixture of
predictable and imaginative schemes. Michael Hopkins' ideas look the most
straight-forward, while the work of the firm of Future Systems has been
marvellously presented and has immense character.
Nicholas Grimshaw, the architect of the nearby Channel Tunnel terminal at
Waterloo, has brought the railway aesthetic into the world of the art
gallery.
The two Japanese firms both deserve to be on the list. Arata Isosaki and
Associates have plenty of museum experience, while Tadao Ando, the current
favourite to win, has produced some strangely moving and elemental buildings
in Japan that are works of art. His Japanese pavilion for the Seville Expo
'92 was a model of respect for the essence of traditional building.
The assessors, chaired by Sir Simon Hornby, are a diverse group. They
include the broadcaster Joan Bakewell as well as two architects who are
poles apart in their stylistic sympathies: Sir Philip Powell, a good if
almost old-fashioned modernist from the firm of Powell and Moya, and Hans
Hollein from Vienna, who is a glitzy post-modernist and designer of the
museum at Monchengladbach in Germany.
Whatever the outcome of this competition, it is important to remember that
it is a major architectural and cultural event. The removal of the 'modern
art' from the other great collections at the Tate, further along the Thames,
is controversial in itself. How successfully this is done depends greatly on
the right choice of architect for the new galleries.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: It's advertising, Jim - but not as we know it
/ How juicy will new media opportunities be for ad agencies? Michael
Thompson-Noel finds out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL

<TEXT>
What will advertising look like in the digital, video, interactive, online,
multimedia superfuture? Will it differ greatly from the steam-age
advertising in present-day media: newspapers, magazines, television, radio,
cinema and posters? How juicy will it be?
Try this:
We are watching the Olympic Games of 2004. The picture fades. Up comes a
message. View our commercial and we'll give you a Kentucky Fried Chicken
Family Feast at half price every Friday night for a month, it says.
(Advertisers have to be polite in 2004 because there is a gadget on our
PC-TV that zaps into oblivion any rude or junk messages we do not wish to
see).
We are hungry. So we push the OK button on our PC-TV and view the
commercial. Somewhere far away, KFC's computer smoothes into action. On to
our screen comes a picture of Arry the Aroma, holding a plate of chicken and
fries. Next, we see footage of Arry wafting along our street. Up to our very
house. His finger on our doorbell. A most seductive fellow. 'Hi, Mike,' he
says. (The computer is all-knowing). 'You appreciate better than anyone in
your street that KFC's the greatest taste there is. What can I offer you
tonight?'
In this scenario we have invited an advertiser to talk to us. He is enjoying
a one-to-one relationship with us, something on which advertisers in the
superfuture will set tremendous store. For companies of all kinds, it could
mean life or death.
This trip to the Olympics of 2004 was conjured up recently by Patrick
Collister, executive creative director at the Ogilvy &amp; Mather advertising
agency in London, for an O&amp;M conference about 'new' media.
It illustrates how senior creative people in ad agencies are anticipating
the superfuture. According to Collister: 'Brand values are going to be
increasingly important as we journey down the superhighway. And in
supporting those brands, creativity will be increasingly at a premium.'
Until now, he says, advertisers and their audiences have had a
straightforward relationship. If you watch my commercials, says an
advertiser, I will pay for your TV programmes. But this relationship is
about to change. Advertisers are establishing what they call a dialogue with
consumers. Instead of soliciting responses, they may well find themselves
responding to solicitations.
This is called collaborative advertising. And various things may happen.
Advertisers who irritate their customers with witless and aggressive
messages may find themselves expunged - booted out of the home. Conversely,
advertising that is friendly and engaging and which espouses relevant brand
values will be worth its weight in diamonds.
Collister's imaginative journey to the 2004 Olympics is not far-fetched. Yet
the most interesting feature of the way the advertising business is
preparing for the superfuture is not the boldness of its conference-going
seers, but its caution and its caginess. It is not lathering itself to bits
but sitting relatively still and spending little money. It is waiting and it
is watching, like a fat spider in a softly shimmering web.
There are reasons for this watchfulness. First, people in advertising
agencies are specialists in communications. They know a lot about media
evolution.
Second, they know that the superfuture will not be technology-led but
consumer-led. So they are not, primarily, watching the technology. They are
watching the consumer, monitoring his likes and dislikes. And consumers, at
least in Britain, are at present 'massively luke-warm' on new media, in the
words of Rhona Tridgell, client service director at O&amp;M. Many adults are
technophobic. They don't want technologies to converge. They want them held
apart. 'Consumers will only take a real interest in new media,' says
Tridgell, 'when it is useful, affordable, user-friendly and time-saving.'
Third, they are experts in hype. They produce it and they can spot it. This
means they can attempt to identify which technology and media companies are
trying to position themselves in the marketplace with an over-use of
chutzpah.
Fourth, advertising in the steam-age media is booming. In Britain,
advertising expenditure this year is expected to top Pounds 10bn - in real
terms, an 8.4 per cent gain on 1993, with further sharp growth expected next
year. All main media sectors are sharing the boom. With so much steam-age
revenue about, agencies are battling to boost their share. Their caginess
towards the superfuture is easily understandable.
But things are starting to stir. At Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Britain's biggest
agency, Moray MacLennan, joint managing director, has set up a group to
study the media future.
'This task force will comprise three or four top people from each of our 25
European offices,' says MacLennan. 'Typically they will be: the media
director, a technology expert, a creative brain and a strategic planner.
Their job will be to educate, investigate - and recommend action. We want
them to start making things happen for our clients.
'In our view the superhighway, in all its predicted glory, is quite a long
way away in terms of how it will affect our clients. But as new media
develop, we want to be on top of them. Will they be different in kind to
existing media, or will they require an adaptation of existing advertising
techniques? The latter is the view we have settled on.
'What will consumers do with the new media? We want to understand what
consumers want and how much they'll pay. Do they want interactivity more
than straight choice? We believe there will not be a replacement for
mass-market TV. It's a bit like saying that photography was going to be the
death of painting, or TV the death of cinema.
'Yet agencies will have to adapt from being a cottage industry to a
high-tech one. So far, technology has not been central to agencies'
business. In future they'll have to be very careful not to be left behind.'
What will become much harder, says MacLennan, is the job of media planning.
Media specialists, who plan advertising campaigns and book the space and
time, will have to become highly creative planners in the fragmented
superfuture, rather than just schedulers.
This is echoed, naturally, by Mark Craze, chief executive at TMD Carat,
Britain's second largest media-buying firm. This year he expects to buy
Pounds 300m worth of advertising space and time on behalf of clients that
include Abbey National, Cadbury, Nissan and American Express.
He says that companies like his have already coped with 'massive change and
growth' in the steam-age media. Since 1980, UK advertising outlets have
grown in all directions. In addition to terrestrial TV, there are now 25
English-speaking cable/satellite TV channels. In the same period the number
of local radio stations (there are three national ones) has grown from 27 to
140; newspapers, from 1,583 to 1,957; consumer magazines, 1,527 to 2,429;
business and professional publications, 2,629 to 5,377; and cinema screens,
1,576 to 1,895.
Recently, TMD Carat hired Blackett Ditchburn, formerly corporate
communications manager at Prudential Corporation, to study new-media
opportunities. 'As media have become more interesting and complex,' says
Craze, 'so clients have shown increasing interest in the media side. And
there has been greater fusion of marketing skills. Blackett's appointment is
meant to insure that we are forward-looking. At present, consumers are
fairly passive. That will change, though we are probably talking five
years-plus. We need to be ahead of our clients, to make sure we have the
answers to their questions when they pose them. We have to be prepared.'
A man who is really ahead is Daniel Bobroff, a 29-year-old former big-agency
employee who in mid-1990 hocked all his assets, lived on a shoestring and
ran up an unofficial Pounds 2,000 bank overdraft so as to found Microtime
Media. Bobroff says his company pioneered interactive advertising in
Britain, and that it is at the forefront of new-media brand promotion. He
says he has produced more than 70 pieces of interactive advertising for
clients such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Co, adidas and Midland Bank, and that this
year he will handle Pounds 1m worth of clients' expenditure - not bad, but
tiny by big-agency standards.
Much of Bobroff's work has involved placing commercial messages within the
running time of educational and leisure software, especially video-games, a
clutch of which have reached No 1 in the UK computer games charts. 'Finding
the right software titles is essential,' he says. 'They have to be right for
the brand and for the marketing brief.'
Bobroff, a smooth talker, was given his first computer at the age of nine or
10. It is possible that he is doing nothing that a hot-shot steam-age agency
couldn't do by Monday week if it threw a few thousand pounds at it and
diverted some key staff from the daily grind.
On the other hand, Bobroff may have slipped the pack and launched himself
into the superfuture. He can count on one thing: people in steam-age
advertising agencies are watching his every twitch.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Myths exposed by AT&amp;T trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When AT&amp;T sent a video crew on to the streets of Manhattan to ask people
what they thought of the information superhighway, one asked: 'What's that?'
Another said: 'Is it a toll road?' A third thought it was like 'one of those
telephone games where a message is passed on and on until it all gets
screwed up.'
AT&amp;T, one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, is anxious to
discover how the public will react to the new services it will be able to
deliver because of the convergence of its telecoms business with the
information technology and entertainment industries. One of its top
priorities is the development of an interactive television service. AT&amp;T is
now in the throes of a long-term research project to find out what the
public wants from interactive TV. The results so far have disproved almost
all its original assumptions.
'Our initial research told us that people would use interactive TV as a
source of information and that it was something they would use on their own,
like a personal computer rather than a TV,' Vincent Grosso, director of
interactive service at AT&amp;T, told a conference organised last week by the
Netherlands Design Institute in Amsterdam.
'We were looking for the 'killer' application - the one thing which was so
powerful that it would make people really want to have interactive TV in
their homes.'
Yet when AT&amp;T began its research two years ago by running a nine-month trial
in the homes of 50 employees in the Chicago area, it discovered that the
most popular channels delivered entertainment, not information. The trial
also revealed that people prefered to use interactive TV as a communal
activity - with the family playing an interactive game, for instance - just
as they do with traditional TV.
'We realised that we shouldn't have been looking for a killer application
but for killer attributes,' said Grosso. 'The service worked best when all
the attributes - information, entertainment, communication and transactions
 -were integrated.'
And the service had to be easy to use. At the end, AT&amp;T found that the
instruction books were still in their shrink-wrapped covers in 40 per cent
of homes. In half those homes, people said their children had taught them
how to use the service. The rest had muddled through.
AT&amp;T is now finalising plans for two more trials which will start next year.
These trials will be bigger and more sophisticated than the Chicago pilot.
However, Grosso is convinced that AT&amp;T learnt some valuable pointers from
that project.
'One of the most important lessons was to check everything the participants
told us. We'd listen to people talking about how they had used the service
for news and information. But their records showed that they'd spent most of
their time playing games.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Glance backwards for clues to success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recently I changed jobs and offices, and discovered that my predecessor, in
his haste, had left his books behind. What a peculiar collection. Odder than
you could imagine. Most of them were dispatched with severely limited
ceremony, especially those with titles like Feminism and Materialism: Women
and Modes of Production.
But one of them caught my eye in time to save it, although its reprieve was
only temporary. It was called Foresight in Science, and was about picking
winners. It contained a brief section that I found illuminating, for it
described Project Hindsight, a study conducted in the mid-1960s by the US
Defence Department that assessed the relative contributions of science and
technology to the development of 20 types of weapon, including Polaris, the
Minuteman ICBM and the C-141 aircraft. Apparently, Project Hindsight
consumed more than 50 person-years of effort, and produced some valuable
findings.
Another indication of the potential benefits of hindsight is offered by
Douglas Rushkoff in his book Cyberia, which is sub-titled Life in the
Trenches of Hyperspace and is better than it sounds. Rushkoff describes an
off-the-record chat with a personnel executive at a leading southern
Californian defence contractor.
This man admitted that his company's biggest problem was persuading
'alternative culture members' (ie, psychedelic-friendly computer
programmers) to work for it. He told Rushkoff, between sips of Earl Grey,
that the 'long-hairs we've hired have the ability to attack computer
problems from completely different angles. It would be interesting to take
the plans of a stealth bomber and trace back each innovation to the computer
it was drawn on. I bet the tie-dyes would win out over the pocket-protectors
every time.'
Hindsight is such a useful thing that I am astounded that companies spend so
much of their time staring forwards - instead of glancing backwards - for
clues to greater success. I myself, for example, have made numerous
resounding suggestions over the years. I made an outstanding suggestion for
corporate advancement in 1970, another in 1971, two in 1972, one in 1973,
1974, 1976, 1978, 1981, 1985 and 1993.
Hindsight would seem to be of most use to companies that are heavily
marketing-oriented: that rely on the frequent production of good creative
ideas. On reflection, though, I don't see why it shouldn't be of equal use
to stodgy old banks, or stodgy old anythings - enterprises that one does
not, automatically, associate with the frequent production of good creative
ideas.
Hindsight could be the wave of the future.
The headline on a recent advertisement for Scottish Amicable European was
big, black and arresting. It said: 'Death begins at 40.' The ad was about
critical illness insurance. I was feeling well at the time, but the headline
was so insistent that I read the whole thing. (Nothing unusual there: I am
that strangest of creatures, a journalist who likes ads.)
'Things,' said the ad, 'start to go wrong at about 40. That's when the
incidence of cancer, heart attack and stroke begins to climb . . . One in
seven 40-year-olds will suffer a heart attack or cancer before the age of
60. If you're one of them, what will happen when you recover?'
It was a nicely-written ad, and went on to plug the merits of the client's
new Flexible Critical Illness Plan, which need not detain us. However, it
reminded me of the convulsions in the insurance market likely to occur when
genetic testing gets into its stride. For example, those two great killers,
heart disease and cancer, are strongly influenced by genes. Before long,
many of us may be able to learn the probable date of our death. But should
insurance companies have the right to demand the results of genetic tests?
Some weeks ago I had lunch with Steve Jones, who is professor of genetics at
the Galton Laboratory of University College, London. In his view, genetics
may kill off the life insurance business, because it erodes our ignorance of
future disease.
'No one,' he has written, 'will pay for health cover when they are pretty
certain that they will live to a ripe old age, or when the (insurance)
company knows that an expensive illness is programmed into the genes and
charges accordingly. Insurance already suffers from the fact that people at
high risk are more likely to buy a policy. There may be a war of cost
escalation which ends with only risk-prone people paying for health
insurance.'
All this, says Jones, is an argument for a national health service, which
diffuses individual risk among a whole population.
Personally, I hate insurance. I resent being asked to pay inflated premiums
to cover claims made by people who are unluckier, stupider, more negligent,
more pixilated or less truthful than I am. There's an awful lot of you
around.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and prophets - Alfred P Sloan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART CRAINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred P Sloan's (1875-1966) sole contribution to management literature is
My Years at General Motors. Published in 1963, it is a one-paced, intricate
account of how Sloan managed GM. Sloan was not an up-tempo evangelist with a
pithy catch-phrase and a store of witty anecdotes, and yet the book is among
the most important in management and Sloan one of the most influential
managers of the century.
'His book is one thing, what he did at GM is quite another,' says London
Business School's Sumantra Ghoshal. 'Sloan created a new organisational form
 -the multi-divisional form - which became a doctrine of management. Today,
it is not ascribed to him, but Sloan was its instigator.'
Sloan became president of GM in 1923, chairman in 1946 and honorary chairman
from 1956 until his death. When he took over, GM was struggling to hold its
own as Ford, with its Model T, swept all aside. He set about revitalising
and reorganising GM along 'federal' lines, the very antithesis of the way
Ford organised itself. He replaced GM's messy, bureaucratic, centralised
system with one based on divisions, each with its own clearly delineated
responsibilities. More than 30 divisions, further divided into groups,
emerged.
Instead of fighting for dominance, separate functions were treated as
equals.
In the marketplace, GM's products - including Chevrolet and Cadillac -
competed as separate divisions.
Much of the current debate about being both local and global can be traced
back to Sloan's delicate balancing act between the twin forces of
decentralisation and centralisation. Sloan's triumph was in achieving a
balance over so many years.
The decentralised structure proved the making of GM. By the late 1970s its
US market share was more than 45 per cent, compared with 12 per cent when
Sloan took over in the 1920s. The federal structure meant that instead of
concerning themselves with the nitty-gritty of production, executives could
turn their energies to ensuring that divisions met their performance targets
and to providing overall direction. GM's fortunes revived and Sloan began to
meet his aim of providing a car for 'every purse and every purpose'.
The new GM became venerated as a model of management. But troubles emerged
with the multi-divisional system. It was built around a vast web of
committees and groups which became bogged down in their own power struggles
and bureaucracy. Stringent targets and narrow measures of success stultified
initiative. Also, by the 1960s the delicate balance was lost - finance
emerged as the dominant function - and GM became paralysed by what had once
made it great.
Even so, Sloan's legacy lives on - the multi-divisional organisation remains
dominant; in the 1980s it was estimated that 85 per cent of large
corporations had adopted the multi-divisional structure. Only now, says
Ghoshal, is a new, more entrepreneurial, organisational model emerging to
replace the world according to Sloan.

Arkady Dvorkovich is one of the stars of the first graduating year of a
remarkable university which lives precariously on the 17th floor of a former
Soviet institute of great prestige.
Behind him is a blackboard covered with econometric equations. 'It's a
different way of thinking about life,' he says. 'That's what is most
difficult at first.'
Dvorkovich is no longer at the university, but has just dropped by for a
chat. The class is on a break and the students sit about comparing notes or
smoke in the corridor.
The New Economic School, two years old, is still a pioneer in the teaching
of market economics to a new generation of Russian managers, economists and
professors.
It is indeed a different way of thinking about life. The Soviet Union
trained its managers and economists to be part of a system in which there
was no division between state and economy; where the State Planning Agency
and the ministries directed inputs and outputs, demand and supply; where
choice, quality and convenience were of no interest; where the provision of
raw materials and components was handled by one agency, distribution by
another, personnel matters by the Communist Party and the trade unions - and
the managers left with technicalities.
Economic life thus came to be seen as a series of discrete areas existing
within an overall framework of control - oppressive but secure. Economics
within this system was, in theory, Marxism and, in practice, keeping the
show on the road without questioning how it moved.
The collapse of the system, and with it the doomed efforts of the
perestroika period to give managers more independence while retaining the
integrity of a socialist planned economy, pitched Russian management and
economic teaching into a void.
While the basics of a market were easy enough to pick up - and had anyway
been sanctioned in peasant markets - the larger issues of enterprise
management and, beyond that, the macro-economic framework within which the
enterprises fit, were largely unknown.
In 1991, Professor Gul Ofer, an economist and Soviet specialist at Hebrew
University, thought he could address the problem by starting a school for
graduates which would teach market economics, in English, at advanced level.
To start anything in Russia is to invite grief. Ofer and his colleagues
spent months haggling for office space - finally finding their exiguous
premises in the Central Economic-Mathematical Institute, an Academy of
Sciences institution built up in the 1960s. It was important in the
Gorbachev period as a centre of reformist thinking, particularly associated
with Professors Nikolai Petrakov and Stanislav Shatalin. Importantly, they
got support from Professor Igor Makarov, head of the institute and dean of
the school.
Funding came from the ubiquitous Soros Foundation and (now) from the Eurasia
Foundation, a recently created US fund devoted to projects in the former
Soviet Union. Together they put up Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 457,000) a year.
This allows the school to pay half a dozen professorial salaries and take in
some 30-40 students each year - many from Moscow State University, the
country's most prestigious, but others from elsewhere in Russia and a few
from former Soviet states.
It is formidably hard. The students in Professor Eden's class - in their
early 20s - were following a discussion on inflation. 'If you have a
government with a fiscal problem,' says Eden, speaking to citizens of the
country with one of the greatest fiscal problems on earth, 'it can print
money and sell the money for goods. There's always a temptation to do that;
it may not make sense in the long run.' The students scribbled in their
notebooks.
'I find the speed of it most difficult,' says Muscovite Anna Pavlova after
the class. 'We must learn subjects in a few weeks if we are to pass the
exams and write a master's thesis. It's much faster work than at the
university.'
The course clearly means that the bright - like Dvorkovich, who will go on
to further study in the west - flourish and the weaker are left behind. 'The
hardest thing is to find out what the teachers really mean,' says Pavlova.
'But their performances and style of teaching are much more exciting than at
university.'
This last comment is hardly surprising. These students come out of
universities which are being starved of funds, are taught by professors who
must take an extra job or jobs to make ends meet and who themselves struggle
with new concepts they once viewed - or still view - as reprehensible.
'The professors have only recently learned about the new economics,' says
Anton Afanasiev. 'They mix things up. Most of them are for state regulation
of some sort, or maybe for some kind of mixed economy. Very few are for a
market economy.'
Eden, who normally teaches at the Technion Engineering Institute at Haifa
and is an adviser to the Israeli Bank, says that 'these students match up or
are even better than the ones I teach. They work terribly hard'.
Ofer, a big humorous man who shuttles between Moscow and Israel, faces the
perennial problems of a Moscow manager. 'We need more space but we can't
find it, and our rent-free status is now in doubt. Makarov got us in without
rent but now his people are putting pressure on him to ask us. After all,
the rest of the institute is full of people paying rent for office space -
why not us?'
Ofer's connections ensure that the school gets some of the stars of the
international economic circuit stopping by. Michael Bruno, now chief
economist at the World Bank, gave a talk at which he floated the idea that
Russia might find a unique way to the market with privatisation playing more
of a role than macro-economic levers.
Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, former adviser to Russian ministers, has
talked twice; Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister, made time in a
ministerial schedule to treat the students to a scathing description of how
decisions are avoided in the Russian government.
In the computer room, students eschew the games which are played
monotonously in every office with a screen and keyboard and instead pore
over spreadsheets and columns of figures. Others sit in the corridors or on
the hard seats, reading textbooks and articles. The scruffy, makeshift
offices and classrooms have the life about them of young men and women
actively grappling with a system of knowledge they are meeting for the first
time in such a concentrated way. It is not Harvard Business School - it is
something at once poorer and purer.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Jumping on the bandwagon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The system of management and economic teaching which Russia inherited from
the Soviet Union was at once narrowly technical and specialist and highly
disciplined. Managers were taught little other than their specific skill -
but mathematical economists were taken to very high levels of proficiency
and theoretical abstraction. Missing between these two was a holistic view
of the economy and an all-round conception of management.
A large number of organisations have appeared to address this gap in the
market in the past three years - ranging from national institutes to
'schools for survival' organised in hotels and even private flats. Indeed,
the skills required by today's business people are, as Igor Bunin, director
of a think tank specialising in management issues, says: 'More to do with
finding one's way around a human and bureaucratic jungle than with profit
and loss accounting.'
The big institutes - such as the Institute of the Economy, the Central
Mathematical Institute, the Institute of the Economy of the World Socialist
System and the Institute of Economics and Organisation of Industrial
Production - used to dominate the academic scene.
In the last years of communism, smaller think tanks sprang up, where the
young men and women who staffed the first wave of reform thrashed out their
ideas. At the same time, often with western assistance, business schools
were established on the base of an existing university department.
Italian institutions seem to have been first in the field: in 1989, the
Bocconi University Business School of Milan in association with Leningrad
University formed the Leningrad Management Institute (now the International
Management Institute of St Petersburg); and the Nomisma Institute of Bologna
founded Mirbis, the Moscow International Business School.
According to research by the Judge Institute of Management Studies at
Cambridge University, most of the world's big business schools now have
links, run courses or have formed joint ventures with Russian counterparts:
a group of US colleges has begun a consortium for teaching Russian
executives.
The Russian Academy of Sciences, reeling from the cuts in its budget and
constitutionally unable to respond rapidly to change, has been so slow to
react that, in September, the Economics Ministry together with the committee
on higher education said it was by-passing academia to set up or extend a
Higher Economic School and an Academy of Contemporary Economics - both
assisted with grants from the European Union.
Alexander Shokhin, then the deputy prime minister for economics, said that
Russia must quickly get into the position of offering 'the same level of
education in economics as other leading countries'.
Professor Yevgeny Yasin, a presidential adviser on the economy and something
of a doyen of reform, will be dean of the new academy. He says: 'The
initiative that we academics and professors are starting is not for us and
our generation; it is for the students of today and tomorrow.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Eurotram unveiled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABB Transportation, Britain's largest train maker, has unveiled the
Eurotram, which project manager John Swanson and marketing manager John
Clark hope will provide the company with significant orders to replace
diminishing train business, Chris Tighe writes.
A Pounds 50m order for 26 Eurotrams is nearing completion at ABB's York
works for the French city of Strasbourg, where a new tram service will be
inaugurated next week.
The sleek, glass-fronted vehicle, painted cream and green with a pastel
interior, is the first tram to be made at the York works in its 150-year
history. Securing more train or tram orders in the near future is crucial
for the works. Its orders run out next October when it finishes its last
British Rail order, worth Pounds 150m, for 188 Networker commuter trains.
The imminent completion of the Strasbourg tram order led to the announcement
in September of 289 redundancies, a quarter of the workforce. The jobs will
go by the end of this year.
ABB believes the electrically powered Eurotram offers it a potentially
important market opportunity in Britain and continental Europe.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Visa aims for more corporate business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visa International, the payments organisation, is today launching a bid to
change the corporate charge card from being just a way of paying for travel
and entertainment to being a general method of buying goods.
The idea, which was launched in the US earlier this year, is that a company
will use the card to buy low-value items such as stationery and maintenance
supplies. This would sharply cut the cost of dealing with the purchase, as
much of the paperwork will be removed from the transaction. Research for
Visa by Andersen Consulting suggests that the cost of processing a single
purchase order and invoice is typically Pounds 60.
The billing arrangements should also mean that companies receive more
information about where they buy their supplies, offering them the
opportunity to rationalise purchasing.
Pilot schemes involving Barclays, Midland and National Westminster banks are
being carried out with 25 companies, including BOC, Anglian Water and Shell.
The move into general corporate purchasing will require many more suppliers
to be ready to accept Visa cards: the pilot with BOC found that about half
of its 1,300 suppliers had to be signed up for accepting Visa payment.
For suppliers there is the disadvantage of having to pay a charge of a few
per cent for all transactions processed in this way.
But the card issuers and the payments organisation emphasise that they will
benefit from being paid much more rapidly - within two to three days of the
transaction - than they are likely to do under current purchasing
arrangements. This in turn, they say, will save companies having to chase
payments which are late.
Mr John Chaplin, Visa senior vice-president for market development, says the
target is to sign up about 50 companies for the card in the first 12 months.
On the basis of results from the pilot schemes he expects the volume of
business in each account to rise to about Pounds 15m in the second year.
He says the more a company is accustomed to using the card, the more
confident it is likely to feel in carrying out transactions this way,
allowing volumes to increase further.
Barclaycard estimates that corporate transactions for less than Pounds 3,000
 -the typical use of the Visa purchasing card - total about Pounds 65bn in
the UK each year.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Gyngell in talks on taking the helm at Yorkshire TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, will have
informal talks this week with Mr Bruce Gyngell, former TV-am chairman, about
the possibility of Mr Gyngell taking over at Yorkshire.
The present Yorkshire chairman is not, however, planning to retire until
spring 1996 so the aim is to have a successor in place rather than go for an
early handover.
Since 1992, when he lost the breakfast television franchise to GMTV, Mr
Gyngell has been running Channel Nine in Australia. He is believed to be
interested in a return to UK television.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, was for a time a possible
successor to Mr Thomas. Talks were initiated by Mr Grade and it is believed
that a proposition involving the allocation of shares to Mr Grade was put to
Yorkshire. The deal was that the Channel 4 chief executive would become
chairman and chief executive of Yorkshire in return for 5 per cent of the
equity.
The retirement plans of Mr Thomas roughly coincided with the end of Mr
Grade's existing contract at Channnel 4. But the deal, which would have
given Mr Grade a stake worth about Pounds 10m, was vetoed by the
representatives of Yorkshire's two large minority shareholders - Mr Frank
Barlow, managing director of Pearson (owner of the Financial Times), and Mr
Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada.
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, which has to pay about Pounds 1m a month to the
government following the tenders for new ITV licences and had financial
troubles caused by overtrading in advertising sales, will announce this week
that it is back in profit.
Some City analysts such as Hoare Govett had been predicting a loss of Pounds
1.5m.
It is believed the company made a Pounds 5m profit in the second half which
will contribute to a modest profit for the year as a whole.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Hospital chief slapped down: Bottomley disowns claim that
patients should be third in doctors' priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, and health service
professional organisations yesterday disowned comments by a hospital trust
chairman that patients should come third on the list of doctors' priorities,
after the relationship with their managers and their own professional
development.
Mr Roy Lilley, chairman of the Homewood NHS Trust in Chertsey, Surrey, set
out the priorities in an article which has yet to be published in the
journal HealthCare Today.
Department of Health officials said Mr Lilley was 'speaking of his own
volition and not for the secretary of state'. Patients had always been put
first and this principle applied throughout the health service, the
department said.
The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts said the paramount
duty of doctors should be to patients and described Mr Lilley's remarks as
'not particularly helpful'.
Mr Lilley said yesterday that he never said that patients should come last:
'Patients are at the very centre of everything we do but, first of all,
doctors have got to get the relationships with the organisations they work
with sorted out.'
Mr Lilley said Mrs Bottomley expected everybody in the health service to put
patients first, but 'down here, at the coal face, there are some real
difficulties with working relationships with doctors'.
After their organisations, doctors have a duty to themselves and their
professional training, Mr Lilley said. He claimed that supermarket cashiers
received more rigorous training in the latest technologies than doctors were
likely to get in developments in medical techniques.
He added: 'As it stands at the moment, a doctor who fancies having a go at
something can, out of curiosity, go and get himself involved in a branch of
medicine or surgery without having to get more qualifications.' This
contrasted with, for example, airline pilots, who had annual medical checks
and regular training.
'Even the little girl on the checkout in Sainsbury's, if they introduce a
new till, has to go on a course to find out how to use it,' he said.
To meet Treasury requirements, performance management had to be introduced
into trusts by next March, Mr Lilley said. But the British Medical
Association had opposed the move and 'just waved two fingers at everybody
and that's made the relationships that managers have with doctors very
difficult indeed'.
Mr Lilley said patients could be better cared for 'if you've got an
organisation that isn't in chaos and if procedures are being carried out by
people who are well-trained and up to date. That seems to me to be
straightforward logic.'
Mr Philip Hunt, director of the trusts association, said the key to
improving the NHS was for doctors and managers to work in partnership. 'If
you come out with statements about how awful doctors are you are going to
undermine that partnership,' he said.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said Mr Lilley's
views were 'completely outrageous'. Patients' interests had to come first.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Call for greater quango scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Conservative MP today adds his voice to mounting calls for more
effective scrutiny of quangos.
In a study published by the free-market Adam Smith Institute, Sir Philip
Holland, former MP for Carlton and an ex-ministerial aide, argues that
quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - should face
automatic extinction unless MPs vote to renew them.
Identifying more than 2,000 quangos - down from 3,068 in 1979 - Sir Philip
calls for legislation forcing such bodies to 'come back to parliament every
few years . . . for a renewed lease on life'.
'Unless parliament specifically votes for each one to continue, they will be
terminated,' he suggests.
Sir Philip calls for the membership and accounts of all quangos to be placed
on an open public register. This would disclose the names of all appointees
and give details of how much they were paid, what work was undertaken and
what action was taken by ministers as a result.
But he argues that National Health Service hospital trusts and
grant-maintained schools should not be 'hunted as quangos'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Clearing a path to the facts: How to avoid being fobbed off
when seeking access to official information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Whitehall's best kept secrets over the past seven months has been the
government's guidelines on access to official information.
Launched in April amid claims that it would open up to the public previously
secret documents and research, the Code of Practice on Access to Government
Information has so far proved to be a damp squib. Figures on how many
requests have been made under the code are not yet available but officials
believe the number is tiny.
Most of the publicity the code has received has been negative. Last week,
for example, the Campaign for Freedom of Information released details of a
survey which found that some departments are demanding money up-front before
they even agree to handle inquiries.
In spite of this Mr Maurice Frankel, director of the campaign, wants to
encourage wider use of the code. He said: 'Try not to be put off by the
charges as they can be appealed against.'
Mr Frankel argues that though the code has obvious flaws, the presence of a
referee - the Parliamentary Ombudsman - to rule on disputes between
individuals and civil servants is a big step forward.
Below is the Financial Times's seven-point guide for businesses and
individuals wanting to make the best use of the code:
1. Starting out
Get a list of the departments and quangos covered by the code, contact names
and addresses, and a copy of the code by telephoning 0345 223242, or by
writing to Open Government, Room 417b, Office of Public Service and Science,
70 Whitehall, London, SW1A 2AS.
Also request a copy of the detailed guidance on the code the cabinet office
has produced for other government departments. This is called Guidance on
Interpretation.
Departments are likely to send you an application form on which to make your
request. Ask for a copy of the department's guidelines for dealing with
requests under the code, including charging.
2. Charges
You may be charged a fee before your request is even looked at. For example,
the Foreign Office will demand a Pounds 15 non-refundable fee which must be
sent in with the request.
However, certain types of request must be granted free, such as those
relating to social security benefits and government grants, and you will
always be told of the charges in advance and asked if you will agree to
them. Ultimately you can appeal to Mr William Reid, the Parliamentary
Ombudsman, via an MP, against any unreasonable fees.
3. Penning the request
If it is not already stated on the department form, add to the top of it:
'This is a request under the Code of Practice on Access to Government
Information.' This will ensure that you are able to appeal to the Ombudsman
later. Also ask for the information to be supplied 'within 20 days as
required by the Code'.
4. What to ask for
Make your request as specific as possible to reduce the chances of your
request being turned down. Information available under the code is meant to
be in the form of summaries of government documents. However if you want to
see a particular report which you know exists, try asking for it.
If you do not have any specific documents in mind, ask for a list of all the
relevant reports and records which the department holds relating to the
issue which interests you.
When the government announces a new policy or decision ask for the 'facts
and analysis' behind the decision, as this information has to be provided
under the code.
5. Personal Files
Officials believe that most requests by individuals will relate to personal
files held by government departments and quangos. You should be able to
obtain non-computerised files under the code, but will still face
restrictions on accessing pre-1991 medical records.
The government has said it intends to create a new legal right of access to
non-computerised files, thus bolstering rights of access under the code, but
no timetable for legislation has been announced.
6. Following up
Challenge any refusal. This may apply when you have been denied access to a
particular document or when you believe you have not been given a full and
accurate summary of a report. Insist on being told which of the code's
exemptions has been used.
You can then go for a departmental appeal. This will involve an inquiry by
another civil servant checking your case and will cost nothing.
Try arguing that disclosure should be made in 'the public interest', as the
code allows.
7. Complaints to the Ombudsman
If you are not satisfied by the departmental appeal you can appeal to the
Parliamentary Ombudsman through any MP.

FT  14 NOV 94 / BNFL plans to sell off precision work business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Nuclear Fuels is planning to sell off some of its specialised
high-precision manufacturing expertise within the next three years.
It is currently exploiting this expertise to build new markets in the
pharmaceutical, chemical and aerospace industries. However, it plans to sell
this new business to its management once commercial viability is
established.
The new business will use techniques developed at Capenhurst, BNFL's
engineering factory in the Wirral, to make components and vessels for its
reprocessing plant at Sellafield.
The techniques enable drums and containers to be mass-produced out of
inch-thick stainless steel to an accuracy of three microns or three
millionths of a metre - smaller than a particle of dust. Such accuracy is
needed for nuclear safety.
In an effort to secure non-nuclear spin-offs by transferring the
manufacturing technology to products for other industries, state-owned BNFL
has formed a wholly owned subsidiary called Deva Manufacturing Services and
equipped it with Pounds 5m of computer-controlled and robotic machine tools
on an industrial estate near Chester.
Its first 30 employees are skilled Capenhurst workers who would have been
made redundant following BNFL's rundown of activities now that Thorp, its
thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield, has been completed.
Deva's first contract is worth Pounds 50m over 10 years, making steel drums
for storing intermediate-level nuclear waste. It plans to double turnover by
selling high-precision steel products to the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries.
The company believes it will be able to exploit its ability to manufacture
to tight tolerances. Industries moving to robotic production methods require
vessels to fit exactly between robotic arms or automatic handling machinery.
The nuclear storage drums cost about Pounds 1,800 each. Deva will also
develop its own brand of a cheaper, re-useable stainless steel drum in the
Pounds 250-Pounds 400 price range for the pharmaceutical industry.
Mr Neville Chamberlain, BNFL's chief executive, said Deva's management would
be encouraged to bid to buy the business out once it was established.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Costs row halts Midlands project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute about future costs has stopped building work at the site of the
new headquarters of the Birmingham Midshires Building Society near
Wolverhampton, west Midlands, and led to the withdrawal of the contractor,
John Mowlem, from the project.
Mowlem has apologised to its sub-contractors and professional consultants,
all of whom had expected to see the project to completion.
But Midshires said a natural break had been reached in the project with the
completion of the shell-and-core work - the basic construction of the
building. 'We always had it mind to retain flexibility to bring the
fitting-out phase in-house,' it said.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Sane to build Pounds 6m research centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sane, the mental health charity, is to build a Pounds 6m centre in Oxford
for research into psychiatric illness.
The Prince of Wales International Centre for Research into Schizophrenia and
Depression will be funded mainly by overseas donors, including King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and Mrs Stamatia Xylas, the Greek shipowner, who have each
given Pounds 1.75m.
Its planned research programme includes the genetics of schizophrenia, signs
in childhood of future psychotic illness and the relationship between mental
illness and asymmetry in the brain.
'We've learned more about the working of the brain in the last 10 years than
in the entire history of science,' said Prof Colin Blakemore, a scientific
adviser at the centre. 'Now we are on the brink of extending our knowledge
towards the conquest of brain disease.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Ashdown launches policy package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Measures to improve training, promote energy efficiency and tackle
homelessness are included in an alternative Queen's Speech to be launched
today by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, David Owen writes.
The proposals contain a range of business measures including:
A requirement for all employers to release employees aged under 19 for a
minimum of two days a week for further training.
The introduction of a training levy on medium-sized and large companies.
A bill requiring interest to be paid on the late payment of commercial debt.
The improvement of equal-pay legislation, with a view to bringing UK law
into line with European Union legislation.
A Liberal Democrat government would also introduce a bill to 'encourage
monetary stability through a restructured central bank with operational
independence and enhanced regional involvement'.
On Europe, the party would legislate to remove Britain's opt-out from
Maastricht's social chapter and work to ensure Britain is 'in a position to
join a European single currency, if and when one is established'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Lottery charities board raises worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of National Heritage is concerned about the slow progress of
the work of the National Lottery Charities Board, the body set up to
distribute hundreds of millions of pounds of proceeds to charity from the
National Lottery over the next seven years.
In the week when Mr John Major, the prime minister, will launch ticket sales
for the lottery, the heritage department is making known its concerns about
the charities board to Downing Street.
According to officials with a close knowledge of the lottery, however, the
heritage department, which is responsible for the National Lottery but not
for the charities board, is sympathetic to the difficulties now being faced
by Mr David Sieff, the board's chairman.
It has expressed criticism to Downing Street about the slowness of the Home
Office in setting up the board.
Mr Sieff was not appointed until May 10 this year, two weeks before Camelot
was chosen as the lottery's operator of the National Lottery.
However, as early as February 1993 - during the committee stage of the
lottery bill - there was a widespread expectation that charities would
benefit from the lottery. The Home Office said: 'We couldn't rush it. We
wanted to get it right.'
It is believed that Mr Sieff, a member of one of the founding families of
Marks and Spencer and the director responsible for the retail group's
corporate affairs and external relations, was not the first person the Home
Office approached to do the part-time job.
Last week Mr Sieff told a charities conference that if the board was to
succeed 'we need time to prepare - certainly many months - before we can
begin the process of actual distribution'.
The first of the weekly National Lottery draws takes place on Saturday and
the first cheque will go to the National Lottery Distribution Fund at the
National Heritage Department the following Wednesday.
The money for the distribution fund will be made up of about 28p from every
Pounds 1 lottery ticket bought and five good causes will get an equal split.
Apart from charities, the causes are the arts, national heritage, a
millennium fund and sport.
The National Lottery Charities Board, which is likely to be inundated with
applications for funds, admitted to a Sunday newspaper that it did not have
a bank account for grant purposes and did not know when it would get money
through to pay grants.
The 071 839 5371 telephone number for its temporary premises in Orange
Street, off the Haymarket in London, was still not available through
directory inquiries last night.
Before any of the distribution bodies can give out any money the National
Audit Office must be satisfied about their procedures.
At last week's charities conference Mr Sieff warned that because hundreds of
thousands of applications were expected from different organisations, highly
efficient business and financial systems would be needed. The 17-strong
board representing all parts of the UK will also probably have to appoint
sub-committees with specialist knowledge to help assess applications for
money.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Magnet advisers to settle cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers and bankers to the failed management buy-out of Magnet, the
retailer of fitted kitchens, have agreed to settle court cases in which
damages could have been as high as Pounds 1bn.
Parties involved include Bankers Trust, the US bank which led the banking
syndicate, GE Capital, one of the syndicate's members, Arthur Andersen,
adviser to Magnet's management, and Arthur Young, Magnet's auditor.
All parties to the dispute have signed a settlement agreement that will come
into effect when one undisclosed condition is met. Those close to the
dispute say a full settlement could be in place by the end of the month.
The case involved two separate legal actions. GE Capital, which lost about
Pounds 70m, claimed damages from Bankers Trust, which in turn sued
accountants Arthur Andersen for Pounds 600m. That is roughly the amount lost
by the banks which backed the deal.
The companies involved refuse to discuss the settlement terms. But the
payment expected to be made by Arthur Andersen to Bankers Trust is thought
to be less than Pounds 50m. Arthur Young, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, is
expected to contribute to the settlement.
Bankers Trust argued that Arthur Andersen was negligent for failing to
provide it with an objective and independent report on Magnet.
The accounting firm denied the allegation. It claimed that it never did any
due diligence or audit work for the bank, and that its duty during the
buy-out was entirely to Magnet management.
GE Capital claimed that Bankers Trust had 'completely failed' to discharge
its responsibilities as syndicate leader and ignored warnings about Magnet's
financial health.
The Pounds 629m Magnet buy-out in 1989 was the largest ever and the first
involving 'mezzanine' finance. Senior lenders, led by Bankers Trust, put in
Pounds 372.5m. Refinancing talks between Magnet and the banks began after
the deal closed, and substantial interest on the debt was rolled-up into the
capital.
Lower-than-expected profits, the collapse of the housing market and high
interest rates soon took their toll on the highly-borrowed retailer.
Airedale Holdings, Magnet's parent company, had debts of Pounds 800m by the
time it went into receivership in December 1992.
The banks that were the original senior lenders bought the operating company
from the receiver. It was sold earlier this year for Pounds 56m.
The court cases had been expected to raise a series of important legal
precedents about the nature of diligence on acquisitions, and the duty of
care of corporate finance advisers and lead banks to syndicate members.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Call for Budget boost to skills training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should take steps in the Budget to encourage skills training
if the manufacturing revival is to be sustained.
Economists from Lloyds Bank argue in their latest monthly bulletin that low
skills levels are 'probably the single greatest threat to the improved
condition of UK manufacturing'.
Manufacturing output has been rising for more than two years, and is now
growing at nearly 4 per cent per year. The bulletin says this reflects the
changing nature of the economic recovery, with investments and exports
providing more impetus for growth. It predicts that manufacturing output as
a whole should accelerate into 1995.
In the bulletin Mr Sheldon Warton-Woods and Mr Patrick Moon cite these
growth rates as evidence that the long-term decline in manufacturing has
bottomed out. The past 25 years have seen manufacturing's share of GDP
decline from around a third to close to a fifth.
They attribute this turnaround to improved price competitiveness,
better-quality goods and foreign direct investment increasing the export
bias of the economy.
Although the UK made significant productivity improvements in manufacturing
during the 1980s, the authors warn that it needs to invest in
high-technology capital equipment, and in the education and training to use
this investment, if it is to avoid becoming a low-wage, mass-producer
economy.
The bulletin notes a deficiency in both education and training levels. It
cites OECD data showing that the percentage of people aged 17 to 22 in
full-time education and training in the UK is 'far less' than in almost
every other industrialised country.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Float of grid may bring rebates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic electricity consumers could receive rebates of about Pounds 10 each
from the planned flotation of the National Grid next year.
Regional electricity companies, which own the grid, are moving towards
giving the rebates under pressure from ministers anxious not to impose a
windfall tax on the grid's rise in value.
The rebates would cost Pounds 250m and the companies also expect to inject
of about Pounds 750m of debt into the grid. This would help offset the cost
of the rebate and the tax bill which will result from the grid flotation.
Most regional electricity companies have accepted that a capital gains tax
bill of about Pounds 1bn is inevitable.
Representatives of the companies will put their proposals to government
officials in the next two weeks. The precise levels of rebates and debt
injections will depend on the progress of the talks.
The talks come amid growing criticism of electricity privatisation. The
Labour party last week called for a windfall tax on the regional companies
because of the grid flotation.
The grid was given to the companies when they were privatised four years
ago. It was then valued at Pounds 1.2bn but is now estimated by analysts to
be worth more than Pounds 4bn. Capital gains tax is likely to be levied on
the difference but Labour believes this is not enough.
The government is unlikely to impose a windfall tax because of its
free-market principles. Ministers are understood to be pushing for a rebate,
which is likely to be paid to all customers in the 'franchise' market who
have no choice about who they buy their electricity from.
The most likely method of flotation is a share split by which shareholders
in the companies would be given free shares in the grid.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Reynolds gains time in crisis for coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of an immediate collapse of the Dublin government and the
consequent derailing of the Northern Ireland peace process receded last
night.
But the crisis may have only been postponed, not averted, with many Labour
MPs adamant that the party should pull out of the government coalition in
the row over the controversial appointment of Mr Harry Whelehan, the
attorney-general, as president of the High Court.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, promised a full explanation in
parliament on Tuesday for the appointment and an emergency meeting of Labour
MPs decided to delay further action until then.
This means that today's meeting between Mr Dick Spring, the Labour leader
and foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, will go ahead. At this meeting the Dublin and London governments
will review progress on the joint framework document for a durable
settlement for Northern Ireland.
Mr Spring said yesterday, after the six-hour meeting with his parliamentary
party, that he would await Mr Reynolds' explanation but in the meantime all
Labour ministers would boycott cabinet meetings.
Mr Reynolds, in a statement yesterday, warned of the damage that could be
inflicted on the peace initiative by an early election.
This same view was expressed by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. In a
statement on Saturday he said: 'The peace process is still at a delicate and
sensitive stage. I hope that the present strains between the government
parties can be resolved satisfactorily and that party political and other
difficulties can be put aside.'
Sinn Fein in particular is anxious to avoid an early election, not simply
for the delay to peace talks it would cause, but for the chances that the
party might have to deal with a new prime minister, perhaps less
accommodating to republican sentiment than Mr Reynolds and his Fianna Fail
party, traditionally the party of constitutional republicanism.
The peace process has already been shaken by the murder of a Newry postal
worker on Thursday. In a move to distance itself from the Newry incident,
the IRA issued a further statement saying the use of all weapons had been
banned since its ceasefire announcement at the beginning of September.
In spite of the Newry incident, the improved security climate in Northern
Ireland was underlined by the attendance at yesterday's Belfast remembrance
day service of the Duchess of Kent, the first member of the Royal family to
take part in more than 25 years.
The trigger for Labour's threat to quit the Irish government was Mr Reynolds
decision to appoint Mr Whelehan as High Court president. Mr Whelehan, a
leading conservative lawyer, has on several occasions been embroiled in
controversy as attorney-general, including the famous X-case - the
14-year-old rape victim who was stopped from having an abortion in England.
But observers point to the sharp deterioration in relations between Mr
Reynolds and Mr Spring which a senior government official said had reached
an 'irretrievable breakdown'.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Concern at loss of building recruits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The construction industry is losing most of the recruits it would once have
had because of the expansion of full-time education, says Sir Clifford
Chetwood, chairman of the Construction Industry Training Board.
As the CITB, one of two remaining statutory training boards, prepared to
unveil a new training strategy today, Sir Clifford said: 'Eighty per cent of
the young people that we normally would have had access to for our
apprenticeships are now following a full-time education until 17 or 18.'
Sir Clifford, who began his career as a trainee building manager, said it
was important for the board to adjust its training schemes 'so that we do
not lose access to the non-academic element of the 80 per cent'.
He added: 'A lot of them will probably find out after a year that they are
not suited academically and will seek to resort to a trade involving
physical skills.'
When asked if the industry would simply lose many of those who continue
their education to other careers, he said: 'You would have to have the IQ.
There are a vast number of people out there who are only semi-literate. We
will always be dealing with these people. And when they are non-academic
they are extremely well co-ordinated.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Labour to demand pledge on aid and arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour will this week press the government for an undertaking that aid will
never in future be linked to arms sales.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, plans to use a Commons debate on
foreign affairs on Thursday to urge ministers to come clean on whether the
aid budget is used to subsidise arms deals.
Mr Cook said yesterday that it now looked likely that the Pergau dam project
in Malaysia was not 'the only case of aid following arms sales'. He added:
'There is a disturbing pattern in a number of countries of big rises in our
aid to them, following big arms orders by them.' His remarks followed
reports in The Observer newspaper that Britain is assembling a large arms
deal with Indonesia soon after renewing pledges of aid.
The Foreign Office said yesterday there was 'no basis for any suggestion of
a link between arms sales and an aid provision in this case or in others'.
It acknowledged that discussions on arms sales were taking place between
British companies and the Indonesian government.
Last week Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, admitted he had considered
resigning in the light of a High Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully
in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau
project.
In 1989 Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide
financial help for the dam while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with
Malaysia.
Mr Cook said the aid budget was there to help the poorest countries of the
world. 'If ministers believe the arms trade should be subsidised, they
should say so publicly,' he added.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Graduate vacancies show 4% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Graduate employment prospects have improved over the past year, a study by
the Institute of Employment Studies shows.
Its annual graduate review found a 4 per cent rise in the number of
vacancies for graduates, the first increase since 1990. The unemployment
rate among graduates was 12 per cent, down from 13 per cent in 1993.
The institute said the unemployment rate was still much higher than in the
boom years of the 1980s, although lower on average than the rate among
non-graduates.
A total of 30 per cent of employers reported difficulties in recruiting
skilled workers compared with 17 per cent last year. Companies said the main
problems were finding suitable employees with engineering, finance or
accountancy skills.
The report warns that the pool of available graduates is likely to increase
by 27 per cent between last year and 1997 but it also says there will be a
rise in the number of students delaying their entry into the labour market
by going on to postgraduate studies.
Dr Gill Court, one of the report's authors said: 'Competition for graduate
jobs is likely to remain intense.'
The institute also notes a rise in the number of students going into higher
education. The number of full-time students on first degree courses rose by
14 per cent from last year. More than 30 per cent of young people were in
higher education in 1993-94, compared with 13 per cent 10 years ago.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Carmakers anticipate boom in Chinese market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Around 20 of the world's leading carmakers are to present plans to the
Chinese government this week for the development of an ambitious small
family car project.
The Family Car Show in Beijing, organised by the Chinese authorities, is one
of the best opportunities for carmakers from west Europe, the US and Japan
to establish a presence in the Chinese car market, which is expected to set
one of the fastest growth rates in the world car industry during the next
two decades.
Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the automotive
subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, said annual new car registrations in
China were expected to grow from around 450,000 to more than 2m by 2004.
'China is an important market of the future' which would experience a
substantial growth in motor vehicle use, said Mr Werner.
Mercedes-Benz, the German car and commercial vehicle maker, is seeking to
enter the Chinese car market with its Family Car China project for a 1.3
litre, petrol-engined, five-seater car.
It proposes an initial capacity to produce 250,000 cars a year. The basic
version would have a price of around Dollars 10,000, and Mercedes-Benz is
offering a number of versions including a seven-seater MPV (multi-purpose
vehicle), a pickup and a light van.
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman of Ford of the US, the world's second largest
vehicle maker, which is also competing in the Family Car Show, met China's
vice premier Li Lanqing in Detroit last week, to discuss Ford's plans for
establishing technical and manufacturing centres in China.
Ford is seeking to strengthen its case by establishing a series of
automotive parts joint ventures in China, but it said it was 'eager to
establish vehicle assembly projects in China at the earliest opportunity'.
The fierce competition in Beijing this week among carmakers coincides with
the publication of a report that urges caution, however, on vehicle
producers seeking to gain access to the emerging car markets of the Pacific
Rim and China.
The study by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts a 55 per cent growth
in sales of new vehicles in the region during the next seven years from
4.75m in 1993 to 7.36m in 2000.
It warns that much of this growth will not be accessible to outside
investors for a decade or more, however.
'As the mature markets of the world approach saturation, as the levels of
competition rise and unit profit margins decline, and as the burden of
overcapacity grows, the attraction of these emerging markets is in danger of
being overstated by vehicle manufacturers anxious to find a new route into
volume growth.'
Congestion and pollution are already problems in the region, with Bangkok
suffering the world's worst traffic congestion. Investment in the
infrastructure of these countries is far behind the growth in motor
vehicles, the report says.
The passenger car market usually begins to grow quickly when GDP per capita
reaches around Dollars 5,000 a year, but it would take China at least 45
years to reach this level, and the position is far worse in India and
Vietnam.
The main areas of opportunity in the markets of the Pacific Rim and China
are currently in components and commercial vehicles, says the report.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Mahathir's Asia line delights Japanese: Malaysia's prime
minister calls for Asia to say No to the west and tells Tokyo to stop
apologising for wartime atrocities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad is enjoying unprecedented media exposure in Japan.
During recent weeks, the Malaysian prime minister has appeared on Japanese
national television and in mainstream dailies; his face covers popular
weekly magazines and his name decorates books on the shelves of Tokyo's big
bookshops.
The spotlight on Mr Mahathir has helped sales of his new book, An Asia that
can Say No: A Card against the West. It is co-authored with Mr Shintaro
Ishihara, the popular rightist politician and author of a controversial
best-seller, A Japan That Can Say No, in which he claimed America's
prejudice towards 'yellow people' was behind the US-Japan trade friction and
called for Japan to stand up against US demands. The new publication rejects
increasing western economic and political influences in Asia and maintains
that Asian nations, which share the same values, are distinct from the US
and Europe.
The Apec meetings in Indonesia have raised interest in the region and the
premier among the Japanese public, along with Dr Mahathir's recent comments
endorsing Japan's bid for the UN Securities Council seat. Moreover, his
disapproval of Japan's unceasing apologies over the atrocities during the
second world war has also been applauded by Japanese bureaucrats and
politicians.
Others have latched on to the media's Mahathir drive. Mr Kenichi Ohmae, the
management guru and former head of business consultants McKinsey in Japan,
has published a book on Dr Mahathir, and a biography has also hit the shops.
At a time when Japan the country is groping for a bigger political and
economic role in Asia, many Japanese have embraced the outspoken Dr Mahathir
as a representative of the region who is allowing Japan to break from its
past.
Dr Mahathir's message is plain enough. He wants Japan to play a leading role
in Asia, and stand up for the region in the international arena - in the
Group of Seven industrialised nations meetings and the United Nations.
Aside from his anti-western laments, he also lists grievances about Japan's
relations with Asia. He criticises Japan for closing its markets to Asian
imports and for the lack of technology transfers. His foremost criticism is
Japan's indecisiveness towards forming an East Asian Economic Caucus, a
regional economic bloc. The plan groups together Asean and north-east Asian
countries including Japan and China, but excludes US, Canada and Australia.
Dr Mahathir believes Apec should be a loose grouping mainly concerned with
helping development of Asia-Pacific's weaker countries but that it has been
taken over by the US, which already has its own regional trade bloc, Nafta.
He says small Asian countries need the caucus to counter 'closed' regional
trade blocs like the EU and Nafta and to raise their profiles in the global
arena.
The caucus scheme has angered the US, and Japanese government officials and
business groups have been non-committal towards Dr Mahathir's plan, not
wanting to upset the US. Mr Mahathir acknowledges Japan's deep 'affinity'
with the US, and acknowledges that the US has helped Japan achieve its
economic success.
However, he says Japan needs to re-evaluate such relations. 'The EAEC will
take off as long as Japan takes charge,' he says.
Mr Mahathir's criticism has pointed out a growing dilemma in the Japanese
government. On the one hand many officials and business executives are
cautiously seeking a gradual shift in Japan's foreign and trade policy from
the US towards Asia.
Such a trend is already apparent in economic relations. The strong yen has
prompted industries to move manufacturing operations to Asia, boosting
investments, while the increasing economic affluence of the region has made
it the largest export destination for Japan. Last year, Japan's trade
surplus with the region surpassed its surplus with the US for the first
time. Ten years ago, Japan exported a third more to the US than to Asia -
now the balance is the other way.
On the other hand, the US remains the central pillar in foreign and trade
policy. Some Japanese officials camp argue that the country's economic
stability cannot be maintained without strong economic ties with the US, and
that the international community will not accept a security policy
independent from America's. In a recent magazine interview, Mr Ichiro Ozawa,
the back-room strategist of Japanese politics, also questioned Japan's
budding allegiance with Asia. Where would Japan be without the US, and will
Asian countries trust a Japan without America's backing, he asked.
So far, Japan has yet to resolve the debate over whether it is a part of the
east or west - an issue which has raged for over a century. However, the
economic and political links with the region are becoming too deep to
ignore.

FT  14 NOV 94 / China 'losing patience' over WTO: FT correspondents report
from the Apec meeting in Jakarta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Long Yong Tu, China's chief international trade negotiator, is running
out of patience. He says he is reaching the limit of his ability to
negotiate on his country's application for membership of the new World Trade
Organisation.
If the year-end deadline for completion of the talks was to be met, he says,
leaders in Beijing and Washington would have to settle the political
differences which he blamed for holding up progress. 'Our negotiations are
coming to a critical stage,' he says. 'Now it is very important to get a
political decision because, just like two guys who are having a quarrel, we
need someone higher up to say, okay, you should work out this thing.'
Mr Long complains bitterly about the US position, which he says is the
biggest obstacle to Beijing's eight-year effort to rejoin the multilateral
trading system. He says Washington has failed to spell out exactly what it
wants from Beijing and repeatedly asks for more. 'They tell us what they
want, and we say 'Okay, we accept'. Then they say that's not enough, we have
to do something more. It is as if this WTO belongs to the US and they can
veto any country, even as large as China.'
Mr Long said: 'They are a little short-sighted. They are looking at the
immediate commercial benefits. China's WTO membership should be a strategic
long-term thing.' He says Ms Wu Yi, China's foreign trade minister, offered
a package of 'important concessions' to Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, at a meeting yesterday in Jakarta where the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation summit opens today. Though Beijing hoped the offer
would create a breakthrough in the negotiations, the US had failed to
respond.
According to Mr Long, the concessions included:
Publishing details of all China's import quotas, covering what Beijing calls
sensitive products such as chemical fertiliser. This meets a long-standing
US demand and, Mr Long says, was the crux of Beijing's differences with the
US.
The extension of foreign banking rights to Beijing and 10 provincial cities,
in addition to 13 coastal cities already proposed.
Permission for foreign banks to transact business in local currency on an
experimental basis after WTO entry.
Mr Long concedes the offers do not fully meet US demands and hints at
possible further concessions, though he says this would be difficult because
it requires complex co-ordination by Chinese ministries. However, Beijing
was not prepared to offer them after the end of this year - even if the US
agreed to extend the negotiations, as it has recently says it may be ready
to do.
The two sides agreed yesterday to resume bilateral talks next month, after a
US Congress vote on the Uruguay Round. But Mr Long says that if the talks
drag on beyond January, Chinese political support for WTO membership will
wane, and Beijing fears Washington will seek ever more concessions.
'The reason we want to set a time limit is that we don't want to be squeezed
by them indefinitely. If they want to use Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade) membership as a kind of leverage to hold us hostage, they are
wrong. We are really at the end of our patience. We know China can do very
well without Gatt.'
Mr Long says it would be 'childish' of China to make success for its WTO
application a condition of its support for proposal to set a firm date for
trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum.
'But in actual practice, I really do think there is a linkage,' he says. If
Apec eventually opened its markets to the rest of the world on a reciprocal
basis, China could lose the full benefits while it remained outside Gatt.

<TEXT>
Australia's prospects for winning defence orders from Thailand may suffer
after a dispute in Jakarta over allegations by Mr Gareth Evans, foreign
minister, that Thai businessmen and soldiers were harbouring Khmer Rouge
guerrillas.
Australia tried yesterday to calm the row, which blew up after autopsies
revealed that an Australian, Mr David Wilson, and two other tourists were
bludgeoned to death by Khmer Rouge guerrillas in Cambodia in September.
After a meeting with Thailand's new foreign minister, Mr Thaksin Shinawatra,
Mr Evans said his evidence of Thai support for the guerrillas was out of
date, and he now accepted that controls on immigration and arms, gems and
logs, had been tightened up. The bilateral relationship was now 'in very
good shape', he said.
However, Thai officials said concern remained about Australia's use of old
evidence to make the allegations. Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, might
tell the Defence Ministry not to place defence orders with Australia, they
said.

FT  14 NOV 94 / East Timor protests embarrass Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue of East Timor is threatening to take the gloss off Indonesia's
hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, after rioting
shook the East Timorese capital, Dili, this weekend and a group of East
Timorese demonstrators climbed into the US embassy compound.
About 30 East Timorese protesters have been in the compound since Saturday
morning and are demanding to speak to President Bill Clinton, who arrived in
the Indonesian capital last night.
Meanwhile, two US journalists trying to enter East Timor without permission
have been arrested by Indonesian police.
US officials and other Apec delegates have said the issue of East Timor and
human rights in Indonesia will not be raised during the one-day Apec summit
tomorrow. 'This event is not the forum to discuss it,' said Mr Ali Alatas,
Indonesia's foreign minister, said.
However, Mr Clinton is expected to discuss it with President Suharto during
his official visit after the summit.
In Dili at the weekend, East Timorese demonstrators took to the streets
shouting political slogans. According to eye-witness reports relayed to
Australian officials, one East Timorese was killed by an Indonesian but
there were no deaths in the protest.
At the US embassy, East Timorese protestors are demanding that the
Indonesian government hold a referendum in East Timor, which was invaded by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later.
The embassy says it has been in contact with Indonesian authorities about
the situation. 'We've been consulting with the Indonesian authorities and
been assured that there will be no retribution taken,' said Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Jakarta on Saturday.
Reports indicate that the situation in Dili has calmed down but the sit-in
by protesters could go on for days.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Apec urged to broaden global trade role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum should work towards the launch
of a new multilateral round of trade liberalisation negotiations to follow
the Uruguay Round, Mr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy foreign
minister, said in Jakarta.
His remarks are one early sign that Apec could lead ultimately to the
inauguration of a new round of multilateral trade talks and that some
governments in the region are keen to resist pressure to turn Apec into a
regional trading bloc.
'Then we can have Apec playing a pivotal role in global trade
liberalisation,' Mr Supachai said. His proposal, made informally at the Apec
ministerial meeting, drew support from Malaysia.
But the proposal also reflects the inability of Apec trade and foreign
ministers to agree a definition for regional free trade in the run-up to
tomorrow's summit. Several Asian countries argue that Apec should be
concerned with principles, leaving the actual mechanism for trade
liberalisation to be decided separately.
Mr Supachai said the proposal by Apec's eminent persons group for full trade
liberalisation by 2020 contained 'a lot of hidden suggestions and nuances'
and the possible consequences had not been fully thought through.
Delegates said Apec would almost certainly have to defer until next year any
decision on the tricky but fundamental question of how far Apec was to
develop into a formal free trade area with common barriers to the rest of
the world that could then be dropped in return for reciprocal concessions.
Though the Apec leaders will be left to deal simply with an outline vision
tomorrow, it would take what one official called 'heroic political
decisions' to agree even a broad and non-binding timetable for trade
liberalisation.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Bhutto arrests father of opposition leader
</HEADLINE>

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the Pakistani prime minister, yesterday ordered the
arrest of the 75-year-old father of opposition leader Mr Nawaz Sharif, on
allegations of tax evasion.
The detention of Mr Mohammed Sharif is the latest development in the bitter
battle between Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif which has overshadowed politics
for five years.
The move came on the eve of a joint session of parliament, the first since
she took power last year, at which President Farooq Leghari is to make a key
speech. Mr Nawaz Sharif's supporters last night promised to engulf the
meeting with protests. The Federation of Pakistani Chambers of Commerce and
Industry warned of 'a severe reaction' from businessmen unless his father
was released.
Mr Mohammed Sharif was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency, which
alleged tax evasion of income of about Rs100m (Pounds 2m). The agency also
charged, but did not arrest, Mr Nawaz Sharif's two brothers, Mr Abbas Sharif
and Mr Shahbaz Sharif, and his son, Mr Hussain Nawaz Sharif.
Mr Mohammed Sharif, a self-made industrialist, is regarded as the architect
of Mr Nawaz Sharif's rise to power. His arrest follows a sustained attack on
the family business empire by the Bhutto government, which has ordered tax
and fraud investigations by the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee and the
Federal Investigation Agency.
Mr Nawaz Sharif yesterday denied the tax fraud charges: 'The regime is
totally rattled and in panic on the eve of the joint session of parliament.'
The arrests come amid factional violence in Karachi, the commercial capital,
where about 20 people have died since last Thursday, and an armed uprising
by tribesmen in the north. The government at the weekend also suffered a
serious foreign policy defeat when it failed to secure the support of other
Islamic states for a motion on the troubled region of Kashmir at the United
Nations General Assembly.
The State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank, at the weekend cut the maximum
bank lending rate from 19 per cent to 17.5 per cent, to promote investment
and economic growth.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Stargate sets sci-fi film bandwagon rolling: A cult movie
has sown the seeds of Hollywood's latest passion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the cast and crew of Stargate celebrated its US premiere two weeks ago,
the most they hoped was that their clever little sci-fi film would become a
steady cult success.
Stargate, starring James Spader and Kurt Russell as intrepid adventurers who
fall foul of a sadistic villain played by Jaye Davidson, has become the hit
of the US autumn season. It grossed Dollars 16.7m in its opening weekend, a
record for a Halloween movie. A fortnight later it still tops the Variety
league after taking Dollars 34.5m.
Its success, following so shortly after that of Steven Spielberg's epic
Jurassic Park, has whetted Hollywood's appetite for science fiction. The
seventh Star Trek movie opens in the US on Friday and dozens of other sci-fi
movies are now in production and scheduled to appear next year.
The film industry is notoriously fickle, but science fiction has fallen in
and out of fashion in Hollywood to a greater degree than other genres.
Movies about life in outer space first surfaced in the 1930s with the Flash
Gordon and Buck Rogers series. Sci-fi reappeared in the trash films in the
1950s only to be eclipsed by the thrill of the real space race in the 1960s.
The genre was then elevated to cult status by Stanley Kubrick's 1968
classic, 2001: Space Odyssey, and Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 masterpiece,
Solaris.
It was not until the late 1970s that science fiction became big business.
George Lucas led the way in 1977 with Star Wars, which became one of the
biggest grossing movies ever, taking Dollars 323m in the US alone.
By the mid-1980s, however, the genre no longer seemed so fresh. The
futuristic films of that era, such as the Terminator series, were classified
as 'action' movies.
All that changed with Jurassic Park, which has grossed Dollars 356m in the
US since last year. It proved to the sceptical ranks of Hollywood
accountants that there was an audience for science fiction, just as the
success of Dances With Wolves in 1990 had heralded the return of the
western.
The digital dinosaurs created for Jurassic Park on the computers of
Industrial Light and Magic, the Dollars 60m special effects laboratory
founded by George Lucas, also acted as a showcase for the new generation of
digital special effects.
These enable film makers to create extraordinary visual images at relatively
low cost by cutting down on the number of extras, stunt artists and sets
needed to shoot a film.
James Cameron, director of Terminator and another techno buff, used the
computers at his Digital Domain special effects lab to create stunning
sequences in True Lies, such as a scene in which Arnold Schwarzenegger
'flies' his Harrier jet through Miami's skyscrapers. Thanks to the new
technology, George Lucas hopes to halve the cost of shooting the next
version of Star Wars to Dollars 50m.
The fantastical quality of digital images makes them ideal for science
fiction and has prompted a number of directors to try out the genre. The new
Star Trek will be followed by Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone,
Strange Days with Ralph Fiennes, and a film version of the cult cartoon,
Tank Girl.
The sci-fi bandwagon shows no sign of stopping. Marlon Brando is tipped to
star in an adaptation of H G Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau. The major
studios are competing to sign Luc Besson, the fashionable French director,
for Zaltman Bleros, his next Dollars 75m sci-fi epic. Even Stanley Kubrick
is making a new movie, AI, a film about artificial intelligence.
If Jurassic Park was the Dances With Wolves of sci-fi, Waterworld may prove
to be the genre's new Heaven's Gate - the 1980 movie that ended Hollywood's
love affair with the western by bombing at the box office.
Waterworld is an aquatic sci-fi adventure starring Kevin Costner. But the
production has been plagued with problems. The budget has rocketed to
Dollars 135m, making it the most expensive film ever.
Oscar Moore, editor-in-chief of Screen, the film industry magazine, said:
'Waterworld does have the makings of a disaster. There have been horror
stories about it from the start. But you can never be sure about anything in
this industry until the movie actually opens.'

FT  14 NOV 94 / Cardoso candidates confident of power: Strong election
showing will strengthen hand of Brazil's next president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Brazil holds state governor elections tomorrow , but the biggest winner
has already been elected. Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes office as
president on January 1, is likely to see his supporters cruise to victory in
the most important states. His own centre-left Social Democracy party (PSDB)
is also expected to perform strongly and seal its emergence as a new force
in Brazilian politics.
Elections are being held in 18 of the country's 27 states where there was no
clear winner in last month's first round. Mr Cardoso, who as finance
minister launched a currency which tamed inflation, won the presidential
race easily. Victories for his supporters in the gubernatorial elections
will considerably add to his political clout next year.
His advisers are increasingly jubilant that PSDB candidates will win in the
three key states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. These states
alone account for 43 per cent of the country's voters, and more than 60 per
cent of GDP. They are also the most influential politically and, because
state governors hold influence over congressmen, Mr Cardoso will be
guaranteed a strong voice in Congress.
Sao Paulo, the country's most important state, looks set to be won by Mr
Cardoso's long-term ally and PSDB leader Mr Mario Covas. He has a big
advantage over his challenger, a populist local politician who, among other
colourful claims, once said he would solve the capital's traffic problems
with the help of God.
The state, home to more than half the country's biggest companies, is also
home to a big potential time bomb, the state bank Banespa. The bank has been
abused by politicians for so long that it has a bad loan ratio five times
higher than private sector banks. Mr Cardoso needs to sort out the state
bank sector to avert a banking crisis and expensive federal support. Mr
Covas may not agree to all Mr Cardoso's recommendations, but is thought to
be looking at ways to negotiate changes.
The expected victory in Rio de Janeiro for the PSDB's Mr Marcello Alencar
will also give Mr Cardoso a strong mandate to attack the city's problems,
especially drugs and economic decline. The army is preparing an offensive
against Rio's drug traffickers and was also to appear today on the streets
of Rio to ensure an orderly vote.
In other important states, PSDB candidates are clear favourites in Minas
Gerais and the big northern state of Para. . The Liberal Front (PFL), part
of Mr Cardoso's election alliance, is almost certain to win the main
north-east state of Bahia and consolidate the powerbase of Mr Antonio Carlos
Magalhaes, , the state's most powerful politician.
The only possible setback for Mr Cardoso is in the southern state of Rio
Grande do Sul. Mr Cardoso's choice, Mr Antonio Britto, faces a late
challenge from a Workers' party (PT) candidate. Opinion polls suggest the
two are neck and neck.
The strong showing of candidates linked to Mr Cardoso partly reflects
optimism about his prospects as president. Candidates have been rushing to
seek his blessing and stress that states which elect his allies have a
better chance to benefit from the economic growth which many expect a
Cardoso government to bring. The new currency, the Real, won Mr Cardoso his
election and is now winning votes for his allies by keeping prices under
control.
Mr Cardoso's popularity should also ensure the emergence of the PSDB as one
of the most powerful political parties. As well as holding the presidency,
it looks set to increase its number of state governors from one to five -
second only to the Democratic Movement (PMDB). The PSDB, which Mr Cardoso
helped found in 1988, also elected enough congressmen in last month's
elections to make it the third largest in Congress.
This is important because it gives the PSDB a strong negotiating position to
build a coalition in Congress. Before the elections, there were fears that
Mr Cardoso would need to compromise to guarantee the support of its larger
alliance partner, the right wing PFL. Instead, Mr Cardoso should have
considerable autonomy from PFL leaders like Mr Magalhaes, so long as his
popularity remains high.
Mr Cardoso's main presidential challenger, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of
the left wing PT, did poorly in the elections. But his party may be close to
a breakthrough. The PT, which has never won a race for governor, has
candidates with good chances of winning in the federal district of Brasilia
and the small state of Espirito Santo. A third candidate is neck and neck in
Rio Grande do Sul.
The PT is growing quickly, helped by its reputation for propriety and by
disillusionment with old-style politicians who relied on corruption and
patronage. Its congressional strength increased by 50 per cent to 54 members
following last month's elections and it is expected to form the nucleus of
opposition to Mr Cardoso.

Azeri and Iranian officials said over the weekend that Azerbaijan had agreed
to give Iran a 5 per cent stake in an international consortium for
developing Azeri oilfields in the Caspian Sea. The agreement, reached in
Baku, the Azeri capital will give Iran a quarter of Azerbaijan's 20 per cent
stake in the Dollars 7bn deal in exchange for financial and technical
assistance. Speaking on Radio Tehran, monitored by the BBC, Mr Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, said he expected Iran to invest between
Dollars 300m and Dollars 350m in the project. Azeri officials told the
Russian news agency Interfax that Iran had been brought into the deal
because of Azerbaijan's inability to contribute its share of the financing.

Thailand is set to breach a steel monopoly by allowing new entrants into the
market. A previous administration had promised 10-year protection to
Sahaviriya Steel Industry in 1989. But with demand continuing to outstrip
supply, the government has persuaded Sahaviriya to co-operate in allowing
more steel factories to be built. The move will almost certainly see two
powerful local groups move into steelmaking: Siam Cement, in a joint venture
with Mitsui and Nippon Steel of Japan, expects to build a cold-rolled steel
plant, and NTS Steel Group has applied to construct a hot-rolled steel
centre. Sahaviriya started hot-rolled steel production early this year at a
Dollars 650m plant and is scheduled to begin cold-rolled steel production
early next year.

Authorities in China's Guangzhou province reported at the weekend that they
had cracked down on the city's 19 compact disc producers in an effort to
stamp out piracy. Two producers had been suspended for 'copyright
violations' and 11 others had been required to 'get rid' of their
counterfeit discs. Six producers had passed inspection. According to China
Daily, 7,700 stores selling CDs in Guangdong were inspected and 1.26m
pirated discs seized. The reported crackdown coincides with increased
international pressure on China to stamp out widespread intellectual
property rights violations. US officials last week concluded the latest in a
series of negotiations with China aimed at bringing it into line on the
copyright issue. The US has made it clear that China's accession to the Gatt
depends on real progress in stopping violations.

Palestinian police arrested more than 150 Islamic Jihad activists in the
Gaza Strip over the weekend following Friday's suicide bombing outside a
settlement in the Gaza Strip which killed three Israeli reserve officers.
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, continued, however, to press the
Palestinian Authority to act more rigorously to prevent such attacks on
Israeli soldiers and civilians by fundamentalist groups opposed to the peace
agreement.
Those arrested included a brother of the Islamic Jihad leader, Sheikh
Abdallah al-Shami. But most of the organisation's senior figures are
reported to have gone into hiding. After an earlier suicide bombing in which
22 passengers were killed on a Tel Aviv bus last month, the Palestinian
police arrested hundreds of activists, but soon released them all without
charge.

before the elections on December 3. Officials from the Finance Ministry,
central bank, Economics Ministry and Planning Ministry are to meet this
month to decide whether to raise or remove ceilings on foreign investment in
listed shares, the Economic Daily News reported yesterday. Securities
authorities have proposed lifting limits except for companies involved in
cement, inland transportation, finance, commercial paper and natural gas.
Government-approved foreign institutional investors today may not
individually buy more than 5 per cent of the listed shares in a single stock
or more than 10 per cent collectively. Foreign individuals may not to buy
Taiwan shares. There is a ceiling of USDollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.6bn) on
foreign funds which may be remitted to the country to invest in domestic
shares, representing about 4 per cent of market capitalisation. Each foreign
institution may invest a maximum of Dollars 200m.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Coalition closes ranks for Kohl poll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's coalition party leaders and managers struggled at the weekend to
prevent breaches in the ranks or other mishaps which might hurt Mr Helmut
Kohl's chances of being re-elected chancellor in tomorrow's Bundestag vote.
With a mere 10-seat parliamentary majority they can afford no more than four
defections or absences if Mr Kohl is to be assured of success in the first
voting round by gaining the required absolute majority of 337.
Party managers are concerned that anything other than a first-round win
could raise further questions over the coalition's ability to govern and
thus weaken Mr Kohl's authority.
Squabbling Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition partners, were told by
their leader, Mr Klaus Kinkel, that they would be taught how to behave if
they did not stop arguing over cabinet seats.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, current FDP economics minister, emerged at the weekend as
the next victim of internal FDP dissent which has already led to rifts with
prominent members including the former economics minister, Mr Jurgen
Mollemann.
Mr Rexrodt said he believed his cabinet future was in doubt although he had
not been told anything official.
'The mood is very agitated in the party and there are not many signs of
human warmth,' he told a newspaper. The FDP is expected to have only three
seats in the new government instead of four, although the distribution of
the portfolios will not be announced until after the election of the
chancellor.
Mr Heiner Geissler, a senior Christian Democrat (CDU) party manager, warned
that a defeat for Mr Kohl could lead to fresh federal elections, implying
that the FDP, which lost 32 of its parliamentary seats in last month's poll,
might suffer an even worse fate in a new vote.
Meanwhile, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the CDU parliamentary leader, summoned all
304 CDU Bundestag members to Bonn today for a 'roll call'. Mr Schauble said
he was determined to avoid any risk of missed aircraft or traffic jams
interfering with the chancellor's election.
In talks on the government's programme, concluded in record time on Friday,
the coalition parties agreed to relax nationality laws so that foreign
children born in Germany will be able to hold German nationality.
Measures which would make it easier to integrate the 6.8m foreigners living
in Germany had been the most thorny issue during the coalition negotiations.
The changes, made known at the weekend, were at least a partial victory for
the FDP, which had to overcome resolute opposition from the Christian Social
Union (CSU), the more conservative Bavarian sister party of Chancellor
Kohl's CDU.
One of the child's parents must have been born in Germany and both parents
must have been resident for at least 10 years before the children can
qualify for German nationality, according to weekend press reports.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Euro-fraud squad turns on the heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As cases of Eurofraud go, it is a classic. A Piedmontese farming family
allegedly helped itself to Ecu62m (Pounds 48.8m) of illicit European Union
agriculture subsidies by importing beef from Poland and then diverting the
meat mixed up with bags of bones and skins to Malta, the Middle East and
northern Africa while reserving the best cuts for local sale.
The family of three now faces fraud charges in Italy, while police have also
arrested 16 Customs officials in Naples thought to have played a part in the
scam.
Efforts to gain convictions are being assisted by Uclaf, a squad of about 60
investigators and officials who operate under the auspices of the European
Commission.
Uclaf, set up in 1988 and for years regarded as somewhat sleepy, has
recently acquired a more dynamic image partly because of the extra attention
EU officials and politicians are paying towards financial irregularities.
It is thought that between 2 and 10 per cent of the EU's annual Ecu70bn
budget is wasted either through fraud or lax financial checking procedures.
In many cases, the complex nature of EU spending rules allows scope for
fraud either by professional criminals or opportunist farmers or
construction companies eligible for grants or subsidies.
A long list of sloppy supervision of cash - and in some cases downright
fraud in areas such as money spent on agriculture, transport and training -
is likely to be highlighted tomorrow in the annual report of the
Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog.
Most of the reported frauds or 'irregularities' crop up in the EU's
agriculture budget, which accounts for roughly half total spending. Many of
the frauds relate to false claims by traders or food processing companies
for export subsidies for transferring farm products (such as the beef in the
case of the Piedmontese family) out of the union to reduce European food
stocks. A second important category concerns cash channelled illicitly to
farmers on the basis of false production returns covering crops such as
olive oil, cotton or tobacco.
According to the latest Uclaf figures, 856 suspected frauds totalling
Ecu212m were reported across the EU in agriculture in the first half of
1994, compared with 1,298 cases involving Ecu248m in the whole of last year.
. While the rate of increase in fraud appears to be alarming, much of it may
be put down to better detection, according to Uclaf officials and thus may
be seen as a positive rather than negative signal.
This view underlines the point that no one really knows the extent of fraud.
In an interview last week Mr Per Brix Knudsen, Uclaf's extrovert Danish
director, said it was 'unfair' for onlookers automatically to assume that 10
per cent of all EU spending was wasted through fraud.
Mr Knudsen took over his job in January as part of the effort to raise the
unit's profile.
The 10 per cent figure is based on a largely unscientific estimate made
several years ago by Professor Klaus Tiedemann, a German criminologist. It
has been accepted uncritically by many EU critics.
Mr Knudsen, an ex-army officer turned customs official who is also an
economics graduate, is admanant that the 10 per cent figure is too high. But
he admits that the cash lost is undoubtedly more than the EU's own reported
figures - which are based almost entirely on auditing of agriculture
spending.
One of the problems in obtaining an overall view about the level of EU fraud
is that reported frauds in the EU's structural aid programme are virtually
non-existent. The structural aid programme accounts for about a quarter of
the EU budget but the detailed mechanisms to record fraud have never been
put in place.
Another problem is the stance of the Court of Auditors. This sees its role
as inquiring into the details of specific areas of EU spending rather than
looking at financial irregularities in a more generalised way.
At Uclaf Mr Knudsen has identified as a priority the job of co-ordinating
actions by several member states in fighting fraud - especially involving
cross-border transfers or manufactured goods or agriculture products.
These cases may cover not just EU spending but examples of where European
countries are missing out on revenues by failing to collect taxes on goods
such as imported contraband cigarettes.
Many of the 90 cases Uclaf is investigating involve efforts to bring
together police, prosecutors or customs investigators in a range of
countries. However Mr Knudsen criticised the 'incredible slowness' of legal
procedures across Europe which he said can sometimes lead to a delay of six
months in getting a justice ministry in one country to release evidence to a
second country with a view to aiding in a prosecution.
With only a handful of cases involving EU fraud reaching trial each year, Mr
Knudsen said the EU needed to show greater urgency over fraud.
Mr Knudsen is keen to refute charges that Uclaf will concentrate on
high-profile investigations.
Just as important, he says, is work on preventing fraud by looking at
possible loopholes in the EU's spending and administrative rules.

FT  14 NOV 94 / UN condemns fighting in Bihac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN Security Council, meeting in emergency session after a joint request
by Bosnia and Croatia, yesterday condemned the escalation of fighting in
Bihac and demanded that Serbs in Croatia stay out of the conflict in
north-west Bosnia.
In a statement read at a formal session, the council said it 'views with
alarm the escalation in recent fighting in the Bihac area, and the flow of
refugees and displaced persons resulting from it'. To this end the council
demanded that 'all parties and others concerned, and in particular the
Krajina Serb force fully respect that border'.
In northern Bosnia, the Serbs appear to be set on punishing the Moslem-led
government army for its recent offensives by reducing Bihac to a small,
deprived outpost, as has happened with the Moslem enclaves to the east.
Bosnian government forces went on the offensive yesterday near Bijeljina, in
the north-east and around Mostar in the south-west. Several projectiles fell
on the Holiday Inn where many foreigners stay in Sarajevo.
The fighting will be one of the main preoccupations of ministers from the
nine members of the Western European Union (WEU) who gather at Noordwijk in
the Netherlands today to discuss how Europe could take more responsibility
for defence without US help. The US, increasingly out of step with its
European allies over Bosnia, has taken the lead in supporting an appeal from
the Bosnian and Croatian governments for a tougher UN policy to protect
Bihac. Its decision to withdraw from the enforcement of the arms embargo
against the Bosnian government entered force yesterday amid confusion about
what it would mean.
Nato officials said it had not been worked out how the US could continue to
co-operate with an arms embargo against most ex-Yugoslav republics while
letting weapons proceed to Bosnia. Since arms shipments to Bosnia are bound
to pass through Croatia, US inspectors would have to make hard judgments
about the ultimate destination of any cargoes they discovered.
France, the main advocate of greater European independence in defence, is
expected to redouble its efforts to persuade the WEU to commit the sums
necessary to develop its own satellite intelligence. A recent study said it
would cost the WEU about Pounds 11bn to establish a network of spy
satellites.
Britain has been doubtful of the need for this. Under its special
relationship with Washington, it is the only European ally to receive raw
satellite intelligence from the US.
However the new US statement that any data on arms shipments to Bosnia would
be classified as 'US only' has brought home to all European countries,
including the UK, the drawbacks of dependence.
Also attending the WEU meeting will be the nine ex-communist nations which
are 'associate partners' of the WEU. Supporters see the WEU as a vehicle for
drawing ex-communist states into the western security system without
upsetting Russia. However, nations like the UK and Portugal have warned
against this approach, saying that it could run into understandable
objections from both Moscow and Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The management of Iberia, Spain's financially crippled and strike-hit
airline, has warned ahead of a new round of talks today that it will break
up the company unless unions agree to drastic wage cuts over the next two
years.
Union action grounded 75 per cent of Iberia's flights on Friday in the
second 24-hour stoppage this month and further strikes are planned through
to Christmas in protest at the company's plans to reduce salaries by an
average 15 per cent over the next two years.
The pay cuts form part of a rescue package for the company that includes a
fresh injection of public funds. New funding has yet to be vetted by the
European Commission, however, and government officials say there is no
chance of Brussels agreeing to the recapitalisation of Iberia unless there
is prior agreement on an effective plan that will ensure the airline's
future viability.
Mr Javier Salas, chairman of Iberia and also of INI, the public sector
holding which owns the airline, said in a letter to employees there was now
a 'serious risk' that the company could be 'legally bankrupt and forced into
liquidation' early next year unless there was agreement over the
management's proposals. Separately the management has warned union leaders
that a failure to agree on the pay cuts would force the company into
segregating its business and selling off its handling and catering units.
Iberia would also dispose of its former wholly-owned subsidiary Viva, a
former charter company that currently serves regular domestic and European
routes, and shareholdings in the Latin American carriers, Aerolineas
Argentinas, Chile's Ladeco and Venezuela's Viasa.
Unions say they are prepared to negotiate reduced wages but that a prior
condition to any cost savings must be a shake-up of the company's board and
senior management. Iberia is expected to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 213m) this
year, which is roughly the equivalent of what the airline hopes to save
under the proposed pay cuts and from a plan to shed 2,120 jobs from its
24,456-strong labour force.
Iberia's management says at least Dollars 1bn is required urgently to
re-capitalise the company.
Even in the event of an agreed plan to save costs, such sums would prove
highly controversial in Brussels where seven European airlines, led by
British Airways, are currently contesting the commission's recent approval
of a state aid package for Air France.

'After the floods, it's a human tide,' observed Mr Sergio Mangano as he
looked down on a sea of demonstrators in the Circus Maximus, the ancient
Roman chariot track, which on Saturday was the scene of the largest of the
three anti-government demonstrations staged in Rome.
Mr Mangano, a metal worker from Brescia, had like many given up his weekend
to come to Rome. He had arrived complete with ear-plugs to permit him to
blow a high-pitched whistle almost continuously. 'Berlusconi cannot ignore
this,' he said, well content with the day.
According to the three union confederations who organised the demonstration
against the 1995 budget, 1.5m took part. The police put the figure at 1.2m.
Whatever the figure it was Italy's biggest post-war demonstration. Because
of last week's devastating floods in northern Italy, the unions had expected
under 1m people to take part.
In terms of numbers and planning (more than 8,500 buses and 50 special
trains were involved), it was an extraordinary achievement, underlining the
unions' formidable organisational skills. Equally remarkable was the way the
protest passed off virtually without incident. But what next?
The right-wing government's initial reaction has been to pretend that it is
business as usual. The hawks are now expected to argue that the unions do
not have enough public support to escalate their protest. Indeed a
confrontation may even play into the government's hands.
Following last month's four-hour general strike, the government made some
concessions to its pension reform plans in the budget - the main specific
object of protest. To concede more would undermine the original shape and
aims of the budget, which is aimed at holding the public sector deficit to 8
per cent of GDP.
As it is, the budget looks unlikely to meet planned targets. To keep the
coalition together the government is already calling confidence votes. The
first will be today on a scheme to introduce a pardon for buildings built
without proper planning permission.
The unions themselves face a dilemma.
They must now decide whether they wish to be the central driving force of an
anti-Berlusconi movement; or limit themselves to protecting their members
who risk losing out by cuts in pensions and health benefits.
Perhaps, the very success of Saturday's demonstration will force the unions
to become both more political and more unified. Seeing the government
coalition seriously weakened by its own errors and by internal divisions,
the temptation to frighten Mr Berlusconi by staging more street protests and
a general strike might be irresistible.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Russians baffled by petrol shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'You do not expect Newcastle to run out of coal. In Demerara there are no
lines for sugar,' said a Moscow daily as irate Muscovites, waiting at petrol
stations in sub-zero temperatures in long queues, struggled to understand
why the capital city of one of the world's main oil producers should be
suffering from an acute petrol shortage.
At the height of the fuel shortage last weekend, when only a handful of
commercial stations in this city of 9m people were selling petrol and diesel
fuel, prices soared to as much as ten times their usual level. The state-run
stations which dominate Moscow's retail petrol trade had no fuel at all.
This weekend, Moscow's mayor, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, responded to the crisis by
withdrawing licences from more than 10 petrol retail companies accused of
'profiteering' from the shortage by increasing prices.
But the new-style commercial 'profiteers' were responding to a crisis which
was, in large measure, caused by old-style state planning. To protect
Muscovites - who retain a sense of special entitlement from the Soviet days
when the capital city was always supplied with consumer goods unavailable in
the provinces - from recent increases in the price of petrol and diesel,
city authorities decreed that fuel should be sold at artificially low rates.
As in the era of central planning, when all Soviet citizens could buy bread
for pennies a loaf but paid for the privilege with hours spent in queues,
Moscow's artificially low fuel prices inspired drivers from the provinces to
flood into the city, provoking a shortage. The problem was exacerbated when,
at the height of what Muscovites call 'the petrol crisis', the Moscow fuel
refinery reportedly suffered a breakdown and suspended shipments to the
city.
A conspiracy theory was readily supplied for the refinery's timely equipment
failure. It was suggested that the plant's management preferred not to sell
fuel at unprofitably low rates.
They are now pointing to the timely repair of the refinery earlier this
week, shortly after Mr Luzhkov brought state prices in Moscow for petrol and
diesel fuel back into line with the rest of the country. But even at the
new, higher prices of between Rbs400 and Rbs500 (between 12 and 16 US cents)
a litre for petrol, the drivers of the gleaming new Mercedes - which clog
Moscow streets with western-style traffic jams - pay artificially low prices
for their fuel.
Russian oil producers are understandably unhappy about supplying their
compatriots at these rates and, beginning on January 1 - when the system of
quotas and licences for oil exports are to be abolished - they will be freer
to look for more profitable markets abroad.
Their eagerness to do so is likely to be increased by the non-payments
crisis which is one of the reasons cited by Russian officials to justify
their reluctance to fully liberalise domestic fuel prices.
However, even at the current low rates, many state consumers of fuel - in
Moscow most notably the state-run transport system and the municipal
infrastructure - have been simply not paying their fuel bills.
Mr Luzhkov's decision to crack down on 'profiteering' petrol stations may
appease Muscovites angry at queuing for fuel in a city where rapidly growing
oil fortunes are ostentatiously displayed at newly established, wildly
expensive night clubs and casinos.
But unless Russia's avowedly reformist new government soon addresses the
distortion of an economy in which many of the constraints on profitable
producers have been lifted, but consumers and social service providers still
expect the artificial shelter of a planned economy, Muscovites should not
expect this petrol crisis to be their last.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Pride of place in French wallets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
It might seem a little strange to commemorate an unassuming piece of
plastic, but the French can be justly proud of a pioneering payment system
that has just turned 10 years old and remains far ahead of its equivalents
in other countries: the carte bancaire system.
While the British still struggle with rival and incompatible banking
networks, and the US has only recently begun to move towards a single
system, for a decade the French have been able to withdraw cash from the
dispenser of any bank around their country - and in many other places around
the world.
For longer still - since 1967 - they have been used to paying for their
purchases in shops electronically with a plastic card, in stark contrast to
the 'Switch' system in the UK, for example, which has only just started to
make progress against cash.
The history of the banking card and the development of the inter-banking
system represent a uniquely French blend of co-operation over competition
and an obsessive interest in developing new technology.
Many of the French refer to the plastic bank card in their wallet as the
carte bleu. In fact, until a decade ago, this was the trade name for only
one of three intensely competitive and incompatible systems with different
cards, procedures and equipment.
Twenty-seven years ago, the carte bleu charge card was launched jointly by
Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Credit
Industriel et Commercial and Credit Commercial de France. Within a year,
25,000 merchants were accepting the 265,000 cards for payments for goods and
services.
Four years later, in 1971, magnetic strips were added to the cards, allowing
withdrawals from cash dispensers at banks around the country. Rival national
systems were established by Credit Agricole and Credit Mutuel.
While the carte bleu network began to add new member banks and sign an
agreement internationally with Visa, Credit Agricole launched a 'Contact'
card - renamed the carte verte in 1978 - and linked up in other countries
with MasterCard.
The battle between the 'green' and the 'blue' cards and with Credit Mutuel's
rival network came to a head in 1984, when the three groupings agreed to
co-operate with a single national network. The new name was 'CB' - for carte
bancaire - with both colours diplomatically included in the design of the
card.
At that time, there were 315,000 merchants and 7,200 automatic teller
machines accepting 13.8m cards. Ten years later, the figures have shot up
impressively: 530,000 retailers and 19,000 ATMs accepting 22m cards. There
are more than 2.2bn transactions involving payments of FFr511bn (Pounds
61bn) and withdrawals of FFr624m in 1993.
'Success was not guaranteed,' recalls Mr Claude Menesguen, chairman of the
Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, the association of the banks that
administers the system. 'Getting institutions with different views and
interests to work together was not clear-cut.'
Innovation did not stop with co-operation between the banks, however. Back
in 1983, the banks were experimenting with 'memory cards' which included
microprocessors. By 1990, all the banks had incorporated these chips into
'smart cards', and introduced a four-digit security code to authorise
payments.
The result has been a substantial reduction in card fraud, which has fallen
from 0.27 per cent of all transactions in 1987 to 0.04 per cent last year -
which the French claim to be among the lowest proportions in the world.
As Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, said in a speech
recently to commemorate the first decade of the inter-banking system, the
carte bancaire allows the best of both worlds: co-operation to offer
customers a universal service, and competition for banks to continue
offering their own services to enrich the value of the card.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Gaullism's rivals suffer setbacks: Chirac and Balladur dent
presidential hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gaullism's rival candidates for the French presidency next year each took a
serious knock at the weekend, with prime minister Edouard Balladur losing a
third minister to a political funding scandal and Mr Jacques Chirac winning
only partial party backing in his campaign for for the Elysee.
Mr Michel Roussin resigned on Saturday as aid minister in advance of the
expected move by a magistrate to charge him this week in a case involving
alleged bribes on housing contracts in 1992 when he headed Mr Chirac's
office as mayor of Paris.
Mr Balladur has appointed Professor Bernard Debre to replace him. As he did
to plug the earlier ministerial gaps left by Mr Gerard Longuet and Mr Alain
Carignon, the prime minister has simply replaced one Gaullist RPR party
supporter of his with another.
Several other ministers have been fleetingly mentioned in the context of
various current inquiries into political funding, and Mr Charles Pasqua, the
interior minister, had urged Mr Balladur to reshuffle his government.
But the RPR prime minister preferred not to disturb the delicate political
balance of his government in coalition with the centre-right UDF less than
six months before the presidential election. The extraordinary feature of
Prof Debre's appointment is that he has a parallel medical career as head of
the Cochin hospital's urological unit, and that in 1992 and again this year
it was he who led the team that operated on President Francois Mitterrand
for prostate cancer.
In the Balladur government, therefore, now sits someone who probably knows
more than anyone else about the president's illness - the chief factor that
has unleashed ferocious presidential rivalries so far ahead of the final
voting round on May 7.
Meanwhile, Mr Chirac's plan to organise a rousing send-off from the RPR to
his presidential campaign partially misfired on Saturday.
The 1,700 RPR delegates at a special meeting in Paris cheered Mr Chirac's
often bitter and scarcely veiled swipes at Mr Balladur, but barely passed a
motion of 'testimony and confidence' in the man who created the RPR in its
present form 18 years ago and led the party until his resignation on
Saturday.
The worrying fact for Mr Chirac was not that the special congress was
boycotted by Mr Balladur, who chose to attend a mountain rescue
demonstration near his Alpine chalet, or by the prime minister's backers,
but that it was shunned by several Gaullist heavyweights, notably Mr
Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, who with Mr Alain Juppe,
the foreign minister, co-presides over the new Chirac-for-President
committee. Mr Seguin's real objection is said to be jealousy that Mr Juppe
has now become interim president of the RPR.
But, publicly, Mr Seguin complained that the Saturday meeting smacked of an
attempt to get the RPR to endorse Mr Chirac as its only candidate, going
against the spirit of De Gaulle's Fifth Republic. This held that
presidential elections are a matter between candidates and the people, with
little or no formal role for party machines.
Mr Seguin warned that 'in refusing to publicly own up to each other's
candidacy', Mr Chirac and Mr Balladur were 'engaged in a suicidal logic' and
weakening each other and 'smoothing the way for a third man - Jacques
Delors'.
If the European Commission president were rapidly to give in to the
Socialist party's blandishments and to declare that he will start running
for the Elysee when he leaves Brussels late next January, this could quickly
shock the warring Gaullists into closing ranks. Mr Delors is running level
with Mr Balladur in the opinion polls, with Mr Chirac still a bit behind
both.
But last week in Paris Mr Delors said he was still 'not at the end of my
reflection'. This includes weighing personal factors such as his desire for
a rest after 10 years of hard service for the European Union.
There are also electoral uncertainties - such as the real odds on him
winning and subsequently gaining a governing majority after 14 years of
socialism in the Elysee and after the socialists suffered such a
parliamentary landslide defeat only 18 months ago.

FT  14 NOV 94 / France's employers to elect chief
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After months of campaigning, France's presidential hopefuls today face the
moment of truth when their candidacies are put to the vote. Not the election
to replace Mr Francois Mitterrand at the Elysee palace, but to determine who
will become the next president of the Patronat, the French employers'
federation.
The 36 members of the Patronat's executive council are set to choose between
two candidates - Mr Jean Gandois, the former chairman of Pechiney, the
state-owned aluminium and packaging group, and Mr Jean-Louis Giral, head of
the family-run building contractor Desquenne et Giral. If a clear majority
is reached the decision should be endorsed by the organisation's 536-member
general assembly next month.
There is much at stake. The next 'boss of bosses' will be faced with the
task of revitalising the organisation, which has traditionally played an
important role in forming economic and labour policy, but which has seen its
influence recede somewhat in recent years. The decline of planning in the
French economy, the reduction in union power, and divisions within the
organisation have given it a less central role. The successor to Mr Francois
Perigot will also take the reins at a time when French business has been
tarnished by a series of corruption scandals.
Despite their differences - Mr Gandois is a captain of big industry, his
rival a champion of small and medium-sized companies - the two candidates
agree on many policy areas. Both believe that the contributions payed by
employers to the social security budget should be further reduced,
particularly in the case of small companies, to stimulate employment.
Similarly, they are in accord about the need to clarify the rules concerning
political funding and the need to respect judicial secrecy in corruption
investigations. 'We must stop this massacre game', said Mr Giral, after Mr
Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint Gobain, the glass and packaging group,
was placed under investigation in a corruption probe.
But there are several important areas of disagreement. Mr Gandois, who
remains chairman of Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel group, is a
convinced European. His rival is a Euro-sceptic, dubious about the virtues
of tight monetary policy. 'This is the first time there has been a doctrinal
disagreement in the Patronat contest,' says one official at the
organisation.
With French presidential elections just six months away, the two candidates
are also divided on political allegiances. Mr Giral, a local councillor for
the Gaullist RPR party, is close to Mr Jacques Chirac. Mr Gandois is more
eclectic in his political ties, claiming close relations with all mainstream
parties. Favourable to the economic policies of Mr Edouard Balladur's
centre-right government, he says, however, that 'it is regrettable that
important reforms which need to be taken have not been'.
A further important divergence concerns their vision for the Patronat. Mr
Gandois has more ambitious objectives than his rival, seeking to develop a
'force for proposals' on all important economic policy issues, from
unemployment and taxation to European integration. He is seeking stronger
direction at the Patronat, which has been weakened by attempts to find
consensus among a membership increasingly divided over issues such as the
Gatt negotiations on trade liberalisation. 'If you seek consensus on
everything, you will be left behind,' says Mr Gandois.
Such an approach has ruffled feathers among the Patronat's members. But many
business leaders are sympathetic to such a view. The chairman of one leading
industrial group said: 'France needs important social and economic reforms.
So we need to find a strong voice to direct the debate.' For most observers,
the voice is likely to be that of Mr Gandois. But officials at the Patronat
caution that the contest has been the closest for many years.

<TEXT>
The French authorities yesterday placed into custody 77 of the 95 suspected
Islamic militants arrested last Tuesday, writes Andrew Jack in Paris.
All but one of the 78 people still held until Saturday were taken to one of
five prisons across Paris yesterday after being questioned by investigating
magistrates. They included French, Algerian, Moroccan and Russian citizens.
Seventeen had been released in the last few days.
They face charges including acts linked to the planning of terrorism, theft,
falsification of documents, undermining the state and breaches of the laws
concerning weapons and explosives.
The police crackdown last Tuesday - which was primarily in the Paris region
 -was the second such large-scale action since the summer, and led to the
seizure of arms and forged documents.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, said the raids followed
surveillance of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which had a network with
branches in Germany, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Microsoft enters on-line information market

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, the world's largest computer software
company, will announce plans for a worldwide on-line information service for
personal computer users today. Microsoft is expected to undercut
competitors' prices by about half.
The company's entry into on-line services is a serious challenge to existing
services such as CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online, which at present
lead the market with a combined subscriber base of about 6m users.
The Microsoft network is expected to be activated next spring and to
incorporate a range of services - among them, shopping catalogues, financial
services, news services and reference works, including an on-line
encyclopedia.
Like existing services, Microsoft's will include electronic mail, bulletin
boards and 'chat' services that allow subscribers to engage in discussion
groups, as well as links to the Internet, the global computer network. The
Microsoft network will incorporate an easy-to-use graphical interface
designed to appeal to novice home computer users.
Instead of charging users according to the length of time they are connected
to the service, Microsoft will keep basic fees low and add 'subscription'
charges for access to selected news and information.
Microsoft has been seeking to attract publishers to become 'content
providers' for its network by promising them a larger share of revenues than
the 20 per cent to 30 per cent typically offered by existing services and
offering on-line advertising.
Access to the Microsoft network will be incorporated in Windows 95, a
forthcoming version of the popular Windows PC program. Only by purchasing
the new program will PC users be able to use the Microsoft on-line service.
Already, competitors are alleging that that represents an unfair use of
Microsoft's near-monopoly in the market for PC operating systems - about 85
per cent of all PCs sold today use Microsoft Windows - to limit competition
in the on-line services market.
Such charges come as the US Justice Department is scrutinising Microsoft's
recently announced plan to acquire Intuit, a developer of personal finance
software, for Dollars 1.5bn. The acquisition is widely seen as a step
towards providing financial services via the Microsoft Network.
Earlier Microsoft settled Justice Department antitrust charges concerning
its software licensing methods by signing a consent decree under which it
has changed the way in which it sells software to PC manufacturers. The
terms of the agreement also put Microsoft's business practices under Justice
Department scrutiny for 6 1/2 years.
If Microsoft can avoid legal barriers, it seems poised to expand the use of
on-line computer services. Fewer than 10 per cent of individual PC users now
subscribe to any on-line service, but industry analysts say Microsoft's
entry might quickly double that.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Sweden gives clear Yes to EU: Vote in favour of membership
keeps enlargement timetable on course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden yesterday voted by a clear margin to join the European Union, keeping
on course the Union's plan to enlarge from 12 to 16 members next year.
The final result showed 52.2 per cent in favour of membership and 46.9 per
cent against, while 0.9 per cent cast blank votes.
The vote followed decisive approval of membership this year by Austria and
Finland. It increases the chances of a Yes vote in Norway, the last of the
four European Free Trade Area applicants to vote. Its referendum is due on
November 28.
The result was greeted with relief in Stockholm and Brussels as the Swedish
EU opposition, spearheaded by leftists and environmentalists, had mounted a
strong campaign, arguing that membership threatened Sweden's democracy and
welfare system. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish Social Democratic prime
minister, said he was 'extremely satisfied'. He said: 'Sweden will now be
part of creating a peaceful and democratic Europe.'
Mr Hans Van den Broek, the EU commissioner for external affairs, said: 'I am
certainly impressed. I can say on behalf of the European Commission that we
are very much encouraged by this result. I think it is a real impulse
towards further good co-operation within the European Union when Swedes say
we want to be a member of this Union.'
In the same vein, Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister of Germany, which
currently holds the EU presidency, said the 'political stability, years of
peace-oriented foreign policy and economic power (of Sweden) are a gain for
the European Union'.
The EU had feared that if the Efta enlargement plan stumbled, it might
derail plans to build closer ties with - and eventually offer membership to
 -six countries in eastern and central Europe.
As recently as a week ago, polls indicated that the No campaign had a strong
chance of victory, although it faced the combined pro-EU resources of the
political establishment, led by Mr Carlsson, Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative
former prime minister, industrial and trade union leaders, the main farmers'
organisation and most of the national newspapers.
Attention will next swing to Norway, where opinion polls continue to show a
strong lead for the No campaign, which defeated a move to join the European
Economic Community in a referendum in 1972. But Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland's
Labour government has gambled that a Yes vote in Sweden would provide the
impetus to swing the electorate towards membership. She said last night: 'If
Sweden and Finland are members of the EU there are many in Norway who will
see it as a break in our traditional co-operation with our Nordic partners
for us to stay out.'
Late last week, one opinion poll, in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten,
showed for the first time for months the Yes camp moving ahead of the
opposition if Sweden first accepted membership. The poll showed a Yes lead
of 46 per cent to 41 per cent.
In Sweden, a powerful appeal for a Yes vote made over the last few days of
the campaign by the political establishment appeared to have won over many
of the numerous voters who did not make up their minds until just before
voting.
Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt, normally bitter political rivals, appeared
together in the final television debate on Friday evening, arguing
forcefully that Sweden risked being isolated economically and politically if
it stayed outside the Union. The vote will provide an important boost for Mr
Carlsson, vindicating his low-key campaign strategy, which was designed to
maintain unity within the Social Democratic party.
The country is this year pulling out of a three-year recession but is still

FT  14 NOV 94 / Delors plan for public agencies to oversee projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is drawing up proposals for public agencies to
co-ordinate trans-European networks, the multi-billion-dollar rail, road and
telecommunications projects expected to span Europe in the 21st century.
The proposals signal a new approach to meeting the challenge of funding,
building and regulating cross-border infrastructure projects.
But they may prove controversial among sovereignty-conscious member states,
especially if the planned agencies are given borrowing powers.
Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the European Commission, intends to
present the proposals at the European summit in Essen next month. His goal
is to revitalise private-sector interest in the networks.
Mr Delors has already calculated that the total cost of the projects would
be Ecu400bn (Pounds 311bn), much of it drawn from national budgets. Of that,
Ecu220bn would be for transport projects, Ecu150bn for telecoms, and Ecu30bn
for energy.
The idea of creating Euro-agencies to co-ordinate the financing, operation
and regulation of the networks is based on the conclusions of a report from
a task force of top officials from EU member states.
Possible models include the New York Port Authority, which is responsible
for the operation and regulation of all bridges, tunnels and airports in the
New York-New Jersey area, including JFK airport. Their regulatory powers
could be modelled on the UK agencies which supervise the privatised
utilities.
The draft report blames network delays on technical and administrative
hurdles rather than lack of capital. Obstacles include incompatible national
standards, a lack of co-operation among member states, and a reluctance in
some quarters to abandon national monopolies.
Other officials said the immediate issue was lack of co-ordination on 11
priority projects approved in principle by heads of government at the
European summit in Corfu last June. They include the planned high-speed
train between Paris-Brussels-Cologne-Amsterdam-London which risks being
delayed because Belgian railways is short of finance. In another example,
France is moving fast on the Paris-Strasbourg link in the High Speed Train
East, instead of the southern link favoured by Spain.
Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish economics commissioner who chaired the
trans-European networks task force, believes that new partnerships between
the public and private sector would help to overcome those obstacles.
He is seeking a more predictable trans-European regulatory framework in
order to minimise risk.

FT  14 NOV 94 / Major faces fresh challenge from Tory Eurosceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party faced another damaging row over Europe yesterday,
with right-wingers predicting that up to 20 MPs may oppose a controversial
European bill to be introduced in the next parliamentary session, starting
this week.
But Tory Eurosceptics are themselves split on how to respond to the bill,
which will increase Britain's contributions to the European Union's budget.
Some Maastricht rebels are arguing that Eurosceptics should not vote against
the forthcoming measure, known as the European Community (finance) bill, but
should keep their powder dry until the 1996 EU inter-governmental
conference. They predict that no more than six Conservatives will in the end
oppose this year's bill.
As MPs began preparing to return to Westminster for Wednesday's Queen's
Speech, rumours continued to circulate about a possible challenge this month
to the leadership of Mr John Major.
While some rightwingers would welcome such a challenge, others yesterday
dismissed the prospect.
Mr Major will tonight use his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in
London to deliver a wide-ranging address covering the economy, domestic
issues and Northern Ireland as well as foreign affairs.
Downing Street officials said last night that the speech would be more than
usually a personal creation.
Eurosceptics last night responded cautiously to a letter sent to all MPs by
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, seeking their support for the forthcoming
bill.
Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, said the arithmetic set out in
the letter - which admitted that the measure would result in net costs for
the UK - was being given a 'very thorough investigation'. He said the letter
put 'the best gloss on an extremely unsatisfactory situation'.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said it might be
counter-productive for ministers to seek to 'raise the temperature' in their
promotion of the bill. He said Britain's net contribution to the EU was set
to rise from Pounds 1.7bn in 1994-95 to nearly Pounds 3.5bn in 1995-96.
Mr Major secured cabinet backing last week for a battle plan for the bill.
He urged ministers to make clear to critics that the cost was estimated at
only Pounds 75m next year, and a maximum of Pounds 250m by 2000.
Right-wingers acknowledge that their prospects of overturning the
government's 14-strong Commons majority and blocking the bill depends on
Labour's position. Labour said last night it was still considering its
options.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Good food for free - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an ironic fact that foods for free from the wild seem to be relished
more by the rich than by the poor in late-20th century Britain. Samphire and
laver are prized highly. Even nettles are relished. By common consent,
though, the greatest treasure trove at this season is ceps, or porcini. I
use the French and Italian names sadly but deliberately, for the charming
old English name is all but forgotten.
Penny bun. The very name is indicative of the low esteem in which we once
held this lovely fungus. Re-christened ceps or porcini, it commands respect
 -and premium prices, fresh or dried, in specialist shops.
Happily, though, whatever you chose to call it, the fungus continues to
flourish in Britain. It is a question of knowing where to look for it, and
recognising it when you find it.
For a millionaire/peasant food treat, you could hardly do better than slice
these best of all mushrooms, saute them in olive oil with garlic and parsley
and serve them on a pool of polenta.
Anglo-Saxons too nervous of Nature to risk picking a poisonous variety of
fungi by mistake, will feel happier gleaning or scrumping for sweet or
Spanish chestnuts. Roasted, peeled, wrapped in blanched Savoy cabbage leaves
and braised they make an excellent dish - comforting to serve on its own,
chic as a partner for game birds.
The only bore is that roasting and peeling chestnuts is such a tedious and
lengthy business. I suggest you reserve chestnuts for leisurely fireside
eating. Then each person can peel his or her own as the chestnuts emerge
roasted and charred from the embers; drop the skinned kernels into glasses
of desert wine to cool a little, and fish them out with a teaspoon to eat.
Cabbage is, in theory, a terrible turn-off: it stinks of penny- pinching and
sulphurously inept cooking. The same is true of carrots. Neither ingredient
is intrinsically dull, of course, but to shrug off the dread image and to be
voted instead as star treats calls for considerable care and imagination in
cooking and in presentation.
Cabbage can be, as already mentioned, splendid when stuffed and braised with
chestnuts. I also recommend shredding cabbage very finely and deep frying it
until frizzy and crisp, a jade green 'seaweed' to serve with Chinese dishes
or as an appetite-whetting alternative to crisps.
Carrots look much improved if cut into neat little batons rather than plain
rounds, and they respond well to turning in warm olive oil. Add a bay leaf
or two, several sprigs of thyme, a mere splash of sherry vinegar, cover
tightly and leave to cook in their own steam in a heavy based pot until
aromatic and just tender.
Serve (reheated if cooked ahead) as a salade tiede, best of all if garnished
(not so cheaply I agree) with a few black olives stoned and cut into strips.
For a sophisticated sweet alternative, grate long carrots into vermicelli
and blanch them in a rich sugar syrup scented with orange flower water and
cardomom seeds or star anise. Served alone or with sliced oranges and a bowl
of fromage frais maybe, this makes an exotic dessert.
Whisked egg whites and hot air are invaluable allies to the cook with more
dash than cash. Souffles, so easy and so cheap, never fail to delight and
impress, best of all if sauced - think of spinach souffle with anchovy
cream, cheese souffle with a coulis of leek flecked with green coriander,
and prune souffle sauced with armagnac-flavoured cream.
Profiteroles are another good way to share a few ingredients between several
people - bubbles of choux pastry stuffed with a dab of fromage frais,
pyramid piled, capped with melted chocolate or coffee sauce, and swirled
with a web of spun sugar for extra sparkle.
Even easier, and less often seen, are dolls'-tea-party-sized meringues made
with brown sugar, piled high with creme fraiche cementing one to the next,
the whole towering edifice scattered with toasted and chopped nuts and
served with a runny, agreeably tart dried apricot puree to sauce them.
Mussels, squid and herring roes all make inexpensive treats, and since
mussels are now predominantly farmed, the effort of cleaning them has been
greatly reduced.
Few foods make more glamorous soups and soups-cum-stews than mussels, and I
love them in rice dishes, for the blue of their shells and for the sake of
their juices which seem to taste both briny and winey. There is really no
need to uncork a bottle to slurp into the pan when cooking them.
Soft herring roes have made few dinner party appearances since the demise of
the after-dinner savoury. They warrant reconsideration now as savoury
starters. I recommend pureeing them and whipping them delicately with egg
white and cream to bake as mousselines.
Alternatively, dust herring roes with flour, saute them in butter until they
stiffen and curl, toss with lemon or lime juice and pile them into fried
bread tartlet cases. In this case a seasoning of cayenne and paprika, or a
mixture of chives, green coriander and capers will finish them nicely.
Most soothing of all, and a useful trick for frozen roes which may be a bit
broken up, is as follows. Stiffen the roes in a smallish pan in a little hot
butter until just cooked on both sides. Then pour on some eggs beaten with
sea salt, black pepper, fresh chopped dill and a little parsley.
Quickly draw the pan to one side and stir and turn the contents until the
eggs are scrambled and the roes are semi-crushed into them. 12oz herring
roes and three eggs are enough for six people.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Penalties for late share price posting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has decided to penalise marketmakers that fail to
fix opening prices on time for shares trading on its SEAQ system. The system
acts as an electronic bulletin board for share prices.
The fines, which will operate in a manner similar to those in effect for the
trading of international securities, could ultimately result in a fine of up
to Pounds 25,000 and/or deregistration as a marketmaker in the relevant
security.
Marketmakers are securities firms which agree to make firm offers to buy or
sell large lots of securities. Because they commit their own capital to
promote share liquidity, they have certain privileges, including the right
to borrow stock and to sell stock short.
These privileges are considered essential for securities firms wishing to
trade on their own account and for those wishing to create derivative
instruments for clients.
The stock exchange said that marketmakers issue firm quotes to customers on
time '99 per cent of the time'.
Penalties announced by the stock exchange in September last year for firms
posting marketmaking prices through its SEAQ International bulletin board
have been effective, with far fewer marketmakers failing to post prices
promptly.
However, the exchange said: 'There remains concern at the number of
marketmakers (in both markets) receiving automatic fines on a regular basis,
indicating their continued failure to open shares on time.'
From December 1 quotes not posted within five minutes of the mandatory quote
period will bring a Pounds 10 fine per security per day. If the same firm is
fined twice in any three-month period, the second offence will carry a
Pounds 25 fine. If in any six-month period the same marketmaker offends for
a third time, summary disciplinary procedures will be invoked.

FT  12 NOV 94 / National Theatre may make a loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Theatre warned yesterday that it might make a loss this year
after reporting a surplus of Pounds 539,000 on a turnover of Pounds 28.3m in
1993-94. The Royal Shakespeare Company, the UK's other leading publicly
funded theatre company, reported a surplus of almost Pounds 1.4m last year
on a Pounds 27.4m turnover.
The hot summer and the failure of some new productions, notably Johnny on
the Spot, hit box office income at the National Theatre, with seat occupancy
down on the 77 per cent achieved in 1993-94. It is returning its popular
success, The Wind in the Willows, to the repertoire in the next few weeks
which should help to keep any deficit below Pounds 500,000.
The National Theatre has been successful in controlling costs in recent
years, and has accumulated a reserve of Pounds 927,000. In contrast, the RSC
still has a deficit - of just over Pounds 1m - but for the third successive
year it has managed to cut it.
Both companies are suffering from the freeze in government subsidy, which
accounts for just over 40 per cent of their incomes. The National Theatre
received Pounds 12m from the Arts Council in 1993-94, but, like the RSC, has
been allocated a standstill grant in 1994-95, equivalent to a 2.5 per cent
loss in income. The RSC received Pounds 8.47m from the council, but is also
supported by the Corporation of London.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Direct Line to be member of PIA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Direct Line, the telephone insurance company owned by Royal Bank of
Scotland, has taken another step towards expanding into life insurance. It
has been accepted by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog that
protects private investors.
The range of policies which the company plans to sell from January is
directed at protection rather than investment. Most do not need to be
regulated by the authority. However, one type of policy does require
regulation, and gaining PIA membership also clears the way for Direct Line
to diversify into more complicated investment plans.
Such a move would bring further cost competition into the life insurance
sector when companies are already under pressure to cut expenses.
In setting up a life insurance subsidiary the company has had to meet not
only the PIA's requirements in terms of the extent and quality of training
it will provide for its staff but also those of the Department of Trade and
Industry.
At its launch the life company will have 40 staff. All telephone calls will
be recorded and saved in a system that allows easy retrieval in order to
ensure that the regulator's requirements are met.
Mr Russell Devitt, the subsidiary's chief executive, said the operation
would prove that it was possible to sell life insurance over the telephone -
an idea which some traditional life insurers doubt.

FT  12 NOV 94 / BT links with BSkyB to beat cable challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, yesterday
announced a marketing tie-up with British Telecommunications to offer
discount telephone services to satellite television subscribers.
The deal comes three days before BSkyB launches its flotation prospectus,
expected to value the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn, and
days after TeleWest, the largest UK cable company, revealed its flotation
plans.
BSkyB - a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, holds a
17.5 per cent stake - insisted yesterday that the agreement was designed
only to 'constantly improve the proposition we offer our customers'.
The move will be seen, however, as an attempt to undermine the
competitiveness of cable, which offers discounts of about 15 per cent on
telephone services as well as television channels. For the past year BT has
sold its own branded satellite dishes in a marketing drive with BSkyB.
Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Communications Association, the
cable trade organisation, last night said the deal would have no effect on
the TeleWest flotation. 'We have discovered that BT can't sell satellite
dishes. We will now see that BSkyB can't sell telephone services,' he
predicted.
For one year, BSkyB is offering BT discount services at an additional
discount to subscribers.
BT PremierLine, which usually costs Pounds 24 a year in advance for a 15 per
cent discount on calls, will be available for a monthly fee of Pounds 1.50
to Sky subscribers. BT said yesterday that someone with a Pounds 100
quarterly telephone bill would save about Pounds 42 a year through the Sky
offer. BT's Option 15 discount scheme, which gives 10 per cent off
direct-dialled calls for Pounds 4 a quarter, will cost Pounds 1 a month
through Sky.
BSkyB is the first organisation to join BT's discount schemes.
BT said yesterday it was providing the service to BSkyB at its normal price
and the satellite company was absorbing the cost of the extra discount.

Gross mortgage advances in October were lower than in the previous month,
underlining the lack of a clear recovery in the market, the mortgage index
produced by Barclays Bank shows.
This is the second month that the index, which monitors the flow of mortgage
advances through solicitors' deposit accounts held with Barclays, has
recorded a month-on-month fall. In each case the drop was 6 per cent.
However, mortgage advances last month were 6 per cent higher than in October
last year.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Bankers Trust switches staffafter derivatives sales probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the US bank that faces two lawsuits over derivative
instruments it sold, has moved six executives out of their jobs after the
discovery of apparent irregularities in its derivatives operations.
They include three managing directors, among them Mr Jack Lavin, one of the
bank's most senior executives and the head of its corporate derivatives
business. All six have been put on 'special assignment' while an internal
investigation continues.
The actions, taken on Thursday but not announced, were prompted by the
findings of an internal review the bank launched after it came under attack
this year from two customers, Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greetings.
Both companies have since launched legal actions against Bankers Trust,
saying they were misled about the real risks involved in the derivatives
they bought. The bank has strongly denied both claims.
Bankers Trust's investigation is believed to have uncovered breaches of its
record-keeping regulations, as well as sales methods that did not meet its
rules.
The discovery of those apparent internal irregularities will come as a
serious setback for the bank, which has been a pioneer in the development of
the fast-growing derivatives markets. It will also add to the pressure on it
to settle the lawsuits quickly.
All the apparent breaches are believed to involve leveraged swaps, the type
of instruments sold to P&amp;G and Gibson.
Under a normal swap, the bank and its customer agree to exchange payments in
the future based on the level of interest rates. Such instruments are used
by companies to protect themselves against changes in interest rates, or to
lower their borrowing costs.
In a leveraged transaction, interest rate changes are magnified, making such
instruments far more volatile when rates move.
Procter &amp; Gamble is suing Bankers Trust for Dollars 130m (Pounds 81.5m)
after losses this year after US interest rates started to rise. In an
interview last week before the executives were relieved of their
responsibilities, Mr Brian Walsh, head of derivatives, said the bank had
sold leveraged swaps to 'less than a dozen' companies, all of them in the
US. The bank refused to say how many possible breaches of its rules it had
uncovered.
Five of the people moved worked on the bank's corporate derivatives desk,
which sold these financial instruments to companies, while the sixth was in
a support area.

FT  12 NOV 94 / US move to ease Bosnia arms ban strains Nato unity: France
calls for emergency meeting on embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France yesterday voiced strong concern at President Bill
Clinton's decision to end US participation in enforcing the United Nations
arms embargo against the Bosnian government.
The protests prompted the US to move quickly to reassure its allies,
insisting the measures did 'not amount to a unilateral end of the Bosnian
arms embargo'.
Nato, meanwhile, said it would still enforce the arms ban. Mr Willy Claes,
Nato secretary-general, said the alliance would 'continue to enforce fully
and totally all UN security council resolutions which form the basis of our
involvement in former Yugoslavia'.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told Mr Warren Christopher, the
US secretary of state, that France was 'deeply worried' by Mr Clinton's
decision that 'we can only regret'.
Mr Juppe called for an emergency meeting of the international contact group
on Bosnia, which consists of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, also described the unilateral
policy change by the US as worrying. But his spokesman said British fears
were eased after a telephone conversation with Mr Christopher.
The US secretary of state told Mr Hurd that although US ships and aircraft
would be withdrawn from efforts to enforce the embargo, US officers assigned
to Nato - which oversees the operation - would continue their duties.
Britain and France have criticised US efforts to end the embargo, saying
they will lead to increased fighting in Bosnia and jeopardise peacekeeping
troops.
However, the Clinton administration hopes the latest measure will signal US
opposition to the Bosnia arms embargo and increase pressure on Serbs to
accept a peace settlement.
US officials said the immediate effect of the measure would be small as only
three ships out of 42,000 challenged since the embargo began 17 months ago
have been caught carrying arms to Bosnia.
Mr Clinton's decision means US aircraft and the three ships in the
19-warship flotilla patrolling the Adriatic Sea will not intercept vessels
carrying weapons bound for Bosnia from early tomorrow.
However, US ships will remain in the region to enforce the blockade against
Montenegro, an ally of Serbia.
Mr Clinton's order also means US forces will be prohibited from sharing with
allies any intelligence they gain on arms shipments bound for Bosnia.
But a defence official said the US would not supply arms to Bosnia and would
still bar US citizens from doing so in compliance with UN resolutions.
Mr Clinton's decision was required by Congress, which ordered a cut-off of
funds for the Bosnia embargo by November 15 if Bosnian Serbs did not accept
an international peace plan. It comes in the wake of the Republican party's
sweeping victory in Tuesday's congressional elections.
In Moscow, the Russian parliament criticised the US move and said it 'would
lead to chaos and arbitrary behaviour in international relations'.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Czech mate to Kohl?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AH HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clinging to the past is an understandable reaction to the continuing
uncertainty in central Europe. But even so, the recent celebration by the
Czech Republic of the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 looks like
nostalgia in the extreme.
The Czech Republic, as well as Slovakia, Poland, and Hungary were left in a
no-man's land after US president Bill Clinton and the Russian president,
Boris Yeltsin, agreed that the former communist countries of central Europe
should remain outside Nato. They were left in a similar limbo at Yalta by an
agreement between Stalin, Roosevelt and the reluctant Churchill. The results
were not good.
Such reaffirmation of a power vacuum in the space between Germany and Russia
underlines the true significance of the 1918 redrawing of the map of Europe:
the disintegration of the Habsburg monarchy by which France, in one of its
unrealistic fits of grandeur, hoped to establish a cordon sanitaire of
lesser allies on the eastern borders of Germany and Italy.
France held on to this preposterous idea for only six years, when, at
Locarno, it adopted, with the UK, Germany and Italy, the equally unrealistic
concept of a Four Powers' Directorate which would rule Europe. The only act
of this 'directorate' was the Munich agreement by which Czechoslovakia was
handed to Hitler on a silver plate.
The Habsburgs' central European empire, which in 1918 paid the price for
linking its fate with the Hohenzollern Germany, had its origin in the union
with Poland and Hungary established for the first time in the 12th century
by the Czech kings. Unfortunately, the centrifugal forces of nationalism,
unleashed in 1918, make it now almost impossible to seek stability in
central Europe by a reconstitution of a strong, defensive, buffer zone
between Russia and Germany.
The other scenario open to the Czechs is to seek the protection of Germany.
In spite of the bitter memories of Nazi occupation and the second world war,
this solution was floated soon after the collapse of communist power in
1989.
In 1990, when trying to obtain support for the establishment of a British
trading centre in Prague, I was told by the British ambassador: 'We would
rather wait a few years until the dust has settled.' And to my rejoinder,
that by then the Germans will have taken the market, he said: 'Let them.
After all, they are so much nearer and know it so much better.' I heard in
this the echo of Neville Chamberlain's 'a far away country about which we
know little' and was cross.
Like most Czechs, I was also cross when president Vaclav Havel chose West
Germany for his first visit abroad.
Since then I have had time to realise that neither the British ambassador
nor president Havel were much off the mark. Germany alone is aware not only
of the economic potential, but also of a common security interest with the
Czechs, wedged between Bavaria and Saxony, and reaching close to the very
heart of west Germany.
Economically the Czechs are now doing better than any other of the former
communist countries and even repaid before time the monetary loan obtained
from the IMF. Most foreign investments, trade - and tens of millions of
tourists each year - come from Germany. Germany is building a highly
profitable economic link with the Czech Republic without having to subsidise
it in the way that it pours money into the four new lands which were East
Germany.
But can the Germans risk alienating France, the UK and US by acting alone in
providing the Czechs with security? Would they dare to make a move
suggesting the rebirth of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation which
was Europe's superpower when the Czech king was emperor or primus inter
pares of the Electors?
Having secured four more years in office, chancellor Helmut Kohl may pursue
the plan of making a close alliance with France the core of the European
Union. In such a core, the centre of gravity would shift to Germany as soon
as it recovered from the pains of unification. France then may have to drop
its objections to an extension of Germany's strategic links eastwards.
In such a situation the Czech Republic could again serve as a gateway to the
other former communist countries, repeating thus the dual link the Czech
Kingdom used to have with Germany and the Habsburg monarchy.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Private View: Positive picture book thinking - Christian
Tyler meets the philosopher Sir Anthony Kenny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voltaire pulling on his trousers, Sartre being shadowed by a gendarme, a
Botticelli nude, some languid Gauguin beauties, a Gillray cartoon of fat men
playing billiards - these are some of the more outlandish images pressed
into service for Anthony Kenny's latest work.
A picture book on philosophy, however handsome, however learned, may seem to
purists about as clever as turning Wittgenstein's Tractatus into a musical.
Sir Anthony, philosopher-knight, former Catholic priest and one-time Master
of Balliol (among many other academic distinctions), admits he was
'initially rather sceptical' when approached by Oxford University Press to
edit an illustrated history of western thought.
But, impressed by the popular response to a TV series on the great thinkers
in which he had appeared, he decided the OUP venture would reinforce a
healthy trend.
'There used to be a certain contempt for philosophers who tried to speak to
the general public,' he said. However, over the last two or three decades
they had been descending from their ivory towers to work in scientific
laboratories and to tangle with such everyday issues as medical ethics and
women's rights. He himself wrote about the logic of nuclear deterrence.
But if the subject is not in decline, where are the great philosophers of
today? Sir Anthony concedes there is none of the stature of Bertrand Russell
or the aforementioned Ludwig Wittgenstein. (His top six, incidentally,
include the latter, plus Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes and Kant.)
'The kind of genius it takes to be a first-rate philosopher - you can't get
a bit right without getting it all right - is something which can't be
expected to occur very often. You're lucky if you get two of them in a
century. We're waiting for the next one. And I think there will be one.
'It gets harder and harder because of the massive expansion of human
knowledge, of all the different scientific disciplines.
'Because philosophy has this extraordinary ambition to take a single,
synoptic vision of the methodology of the whole of human knowledge it
becomes a more and more ambitious task. Nobody could ever be again what
Aristotle was, a master of all the sciences.'
Is philosophy today in retreat from science; can it pretend to be more than
a handmaiden?
'I don't think it's true that it's in retreat from science,' Sir Anthony
said. 'The relationship is rather different, and always has been. Rather
than being the handmaiden, philosophy is parent or nursemaid to the
sciences. That is, there are areas of human curiosity where we not only
don't yet have the answers, but we haven't got the questions properly
formulated.
'Gradually, through reflection, the terminology and methodology become
clear. Once that emerges, then a new scientific discipline sets up house on
its own. It's like the relation between a parent and an immature child
becoming mature. So philosophy is in retreat from science only in the way in
which parents are in retreat from their children.'
A good example, he said, was the problem of mind itself, currently
preoccupying both philosophers and scientists. Until they could decide
whether, for instance, thoughts are independent of language, a scientific
project was not really possible.
Philosophy was a never-ending story, Sir Anthony said, partly because of
oddities such as the self-reflexiveness of language and mind.
'Philosophy is to some extent parasitic. When it has done its job well, it
just disappears without trace. People are then able to think without the
muddles which they had.
'So you can either say there aren't any achievements - they all belong to
the sciences - or you can claim all of them.'
If science eats up philosophy, does philosophy undermine religion? In Sir
Anthony's case it did. Born into a Catholic family in Liverpool, he went to
Gregorian University, Rome, and was ord-ained. Eight years later he returned
to the lay state and three years after that married an American.
Somewhere in the course of studying Aquinas's famous five 'proofs' of the
existence of God, the young priest lost his faith. It was the conflict
between divine omniscience and human free will that did for him. These days
he is a true agnostic. 'I know of no compelling argument either for the
existence of God or against,' he said.
'But many of the best philosophers I know are very religious people.' (He
mentioned Michael Dummett, former Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, and
his own tutors Peter Geach and Elizabeth Anscombe - all Roman Catholics.)
'I don't believe in double truths. I don't believe something can be true in
religion and false in science. There's just Truth. Of course, people can
believe in God quite rationally without having a philosophical proof. That's
why I've said I am agnostic.'
Then what do you do for consolation, I asked. Is philosophy sufficient?
'I don't think the function of either philosophy or religion is consolation.
Wanting to know what is true is a more serious motive than what is
comfortable.' To believe something without cause was superstitious and to
put comfort above truth was 'ignoble'.
I suggested that was precisely what many people do.
'The question is not about people do but what they ought to do.'
If he is an intellectual ascetic, Sir Anthony was not behaving like one. He
remained calm and affable. So I gave him another push.
'Isn't it a fact of life that people don't do what they ought to do? They do
what makes the burden of consciousness easier? You're a human being like the
rest of us, so . . .
He parried with a laugh. 'Are you urging me to do what I oughtn't to do?'
Why not?
He laughed again. 'Then you're a bad man if you're telling me to do what I
oughtn't to do.'
Aren't you afraid that at the last moment you'll reach for the priest?
'There are all kinds of temptation which I might succumb to at some time or
other in my life.'
Is that one you've decided not to succumb to?
He paused. 'It's something . . . I mean, one cannot predict what one's
beliefs will be at a later stage. I hope very much that I wouldn't be so
weak as to ask for the consolations of a religion I didn't believe in.'
Do you suspect you will?
'I have no idea.'
Do you think about it?
'No.'
Do people chide you with it?
'No, this kind of conversation that you and I are having is extremely rare.'
Don't your friends say 'Once a Catholic, always a Catholic?'
'Most of my friends have known me since I stopped being a priest and are
more interested in what I've done with my life since I got on the right
track than the mistake I made early on.'
Were philosophers' attitudes largely a function of their epoch and
upbringing?
'I think 'function of' is a sort of weasel word. If it means that they are
influenced, that's obviously true. If you think they are determined without
the alternative, I think that is quite untrue. I don't believe in
determinism.'
Are they influenced sometimes more than they understand?
'Yes. I agree with that entirely.'
I asked him how far his own career had been influenced by his unusual
upbringing. Sir Anthony said the Latin and Greek he had learnt in the
seminary had proved extremely useful. He had reacted against the philosophy
taught him in Rome but it was there he acquired his deep interest in Thomas
Aquinas. 'You won't find that I'm one of those ex-Catholics who devote their
life to attacking the Catholic church or Catholic philosophers. On the
contrary. I recognise the importance and intellectual power of those
philosophers, living and dead. I just think they've got some of it wrong.'
Would you recommend philosophy as a career?
'I don't think anyone should take it up as a career unless they feel they
must. It is something that has got to compel you if you're going to do it at
all well.
'Unless people are really gripped by at leat one major philosophical
problem, and willing to put aside a lot of other things in order to get to
grips with it, they oughtn't to become a philosophers . . . though they'll
need philosophy for other things . . .
'On the other hand, I think that somebody can be a very good philosopher
without being a professional.'
Can it be morbid, depressing?
'I haven't noticed philosophers looking any more depressed than others,' he
smiled.
So it hasn't got you down?
'No. It's one of the most exciting things there is.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / A diplomatic incident over sunshine: Should you go to Peru
or Bolivia to see the solar eclipse? Neither, says Peter Aspden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nations rejoice, nations mourn; and nations can also look very foolish
indeed. Just look at some of the tiffs they get into. Until last week, the
silliest diplomatic incident I had ever come across was the one which
accompanied the England cricket team's 'bodyline' tour of Australia in
1932-3.
For those unfamiliar with this seminal moment in both countries' sporting
histories, it consisted of an upper-class Englishman telling a lower-class
Englishman to hurl a projectile very fast at the heads of a number of
Australians. The countries' dignitaries exchanged angry letters, questions
were asked in the House, and the entire episode coincidentally said
everything you needed to know about pre-war English attitudes to social
mobility and colonialism.
But last week, thrown away at the bottom of a story in The Times, came an
infinitely (and I use the term deliberately) more absurd example of state
squabbling. It concerned the sighting of a total solar eclipse in South
America, the rarity of which understandably caused quite a commotion.
Tourists arrived from all over the world for a view of this outstanding
phenomenon; and what could be more wholesome than that?
Well, here is that last paragraph in full: 'The event has caused a
diplomatic rift between Bolivia and Peru, which accused each other of
printing false astronomy charts and maps to attract more visitors to their
observation points.' Yes, indeed; this was no mere solar eclipse, but a
quintessential entrepreneurial opportunity to earn some hard cash for a
couple of strapped economies. So while the Nobel Peace prize winner
Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan, was waxing spatial on the eclipse
symbolising the sun and moon making love, and producing an offspring of love
and peace, the boys in the back rooms were hatching a fiendish cartographic
scam to improve the balance of payments.
The idea that both the astronomer, that most millimetrically precise of
scientists, and the innocent romantic, contemplating our ultimate
insignificance for a moment or two, can thus be ambushed by political
expedience is rich in cosmic irony. Do not ask for the moon, as Bette Davis
so nearly said, when we have the technology to redraw the sky.
But maybe the Bolivians and / or Peruvians (I am refusing to adjudicate on
this one) have a point. The notion that anyone should spend time looking at
the night sky for any reason other than whimsy is ludicrous.
In South American mythology, what we call an eclipse is in fact a puma
devouring the sun; to prevent the sun's death, the puma has to be frightened
away by the screams of animals and children beaten with sticks.
This strikes me as considerably more plausible than the latest findings by
cosmologists and that tiresome Hubble space telescope, which conclude that
the universe is only half as old as the stars it contains. The scientists
poring over this remarkable result at least have the grace to confess that
it is a logical impossibility, but I am sure that will not stop them
devising another muddle-headed piece of nonsense about the beginning of the
universe, as if anyone cares any more.
These people make their reputations by blinding us with staggering facts and
ridiculous figures, and hope, like the Inca kings, that we will be impressed
by the glare. It is no accident that whenever they urge us to watch
something worth watching, it has to be through a pinhole in a shoe box.
Well it is time to whip off the sunglasses. I am branching out on my own.
While doing some further reading on this subject, I have discovered that
there is something called the Andromeda Nebula which is zipping towards our
doomed planet at 300km a second.
With the aid of Bolivian and Peruvian researchers, and last week's episode
of Star Trek, I have calculated to the last decimal point that it will be
arriving, sooner rather than later, in the vegetable patch of my back
garden. You can all come and watch for a fee which must, of course, reflect
realistically the costs of my research. And if you are in any mood to argue,
I will set the puma on you, I promise.

FT  12 NOV 94 / As They Say in Europe: Egbert Mulliner's torrent of tosh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an air of fatigue in the reports from foreign correspondents in
London these days. British political scandals do not match the stories back
home. How can you get excited about a FFr4,000 bill at the Ritz hotel in
Paris when your readers yawn over Dollars 4m bribery exposes? What interest
is there in the complex, and possibly scandalous, marital arrangements of a
former minister if actual ministers at home are in prison?
Then there is the traditional British obsession with minutiae. Who else
would care to unravel the details of the fax sent by The Guardian newspaper
to the Ritz to obtain a copy of a ministerial bill, especially when there
seems to have been no need for the fax in the first place?
In France, it is so simple: a minister is alleged to have had his villa in
St Tropez done up by a builder in search of public contracts. Everybody can
understand that. In Italy, things are even more straightforward and larger
sums are involved. Only the Germans match British tedium. Was a
recommendation to buy certain supermarket trolley spare parts written on
ministerial notepaper?
But, however difficult the British political story is for the foreign
correspondent, the crisis surrounding the royal family presents even more
horrible problems. There is, even at this stage, the possibility that one's
readers may have some passing interest in the affair. The Princess of Wales
plays a major role in the popular press around the globe. Prince Charles
gained similar fame by marrying her.
The problem faced by the London correspondent reminds one of PG Wodehouse's
story, Best Seller. It concerns a young man, Egbert Mulliner, whose work it
is to interview lady novelists and review their overwrought and monotonous
writings for a literary magazine. He is driven to the brink of madness by a
particularly horrifying work called Parted Ways.
A similar problem is posed by the waterfall of revelations of parted ways
emanating from the royal house of Windsor. Books alternate, outlining the
grim vortex of emotions into which the protagonists are plunged. Every
Monday, readers back home seek more details. La Stampa obliges under a
series of subject headings - 'A French marriage?' and 'The divorce' and
'Camilla' and so on. This treatment lends itself to word processor paste-ups
and enables the correspondent to provide a reasonable account of latest
developments without going mad.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung shares out the story between its London
correspondents. Gina Thomas tackles the Charles angle while Bernhard
Heimrich reports on the Diana phenomenon. Between them, they handle one
story every two weeks, which is as much as flesh and blood can stand.
Last month, Thomas gave a robust account of the prince's views as purveyed
by author Jonathan Dimbleby under the headline: 'What happened to the stiff
upper lip?' This week, Heimrich seemed vulnerable to Mulliner's syndrome.
His story had as a subheading: 'Another creepy weekend for British readers.'
There followed a Gothic introduction which pursued such matters as:
Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night, fireworks concealing another noise that
posed an even greater threat to a British institution even older than the
Parliament threatened by Fawkes - the royal family. That background noise
came from the printing presses of the Sunday Times, churning out
pre-publication excerpts from yet another product of the Diana industry.
This marital swamp only reinforces the bad name that the British have given
to tacky, keyhole journalism. Those who wish to keep a lid on things point
to Britain as an example of what happens if you do not. In France, the
revelations about President Mitterrand's 'love child', Mazarine, would not
have stirred up such a fuss had there not been the ghastly cross-Channel
experience to point to.
In France today, the toadying attitude towards those in power is justified
by a reference to Britain - 'Do we really want to be like that?' Yet, there
is enormous cause for concern: Mazarine has been supported by the state,
which has employed dubious personalities to liaise between her and the
presidency. This is a matter of public interest. In spite of that, one paper
could write: 'It was the honour of our profession not to give itself up to
voyeurism, not to scrutinise hidden lives through the keyhole.'
Even in France, though, some argued that the matter had to be exposed
because it was already well-known to a select corps of Paris journalists.
The biggest selling daily, Ouest-France, replied: 'But doctors, lawyers,
priests know a lot of things which others do not know: should they divulge
them as well?'
Because no trivial matter can be kept secret in Britain, the French argue
that journalists should take a vow of silence. If the 'truth' becomes a
torrent of tosh, the opponents of truth feel able to resort to any argument,
no matter how fatuous, to support their cause.

<TEXT>
COMING BACK BROCKENS by Mark Hudson Cape Pounds 16.99, 310 pages
Mark Hudson is the author of an excellent and fascinating book telling of
his stay in a village in the Gambia: Our Grandmothers' Drums. Here, in
Coming Back Brockens he applies a rather similar first-person,
not-quite-anthropological approach to a village closer to home and to his
heart - Horden in the Durham coalfield.
'My father's family were miners,' he begins, 'working the narrow seams five
miles out under the North Sea, lying in spaces only 18 inches deep, often in
water, hacking into the coal with picks or a primitive coal-cutting machine
called a nig-nog.'
Hudson goes back to live for nine months in the village so often described
to him by his father, who had escaped, through education, this underground
fate. He tracks down family, looks up old men, talks with retired managers
and union officials, finds 'the last communist in Horden' and the women who
fought in 1985.
He is exploring a doomed society, a lost world: Horden, once the biggest
colliery in Britain, 'moderate' in that it did not support Arthur Scargill,
closed down after the 1984-1985 strike. There used to be 188 pits
nationally, and now, in the old Durham area, there are none.
Today, in Hudson's appalled account, there is a society in decay, a society
which has cut back on its ambitions, where children have less faith in
education than they ever did, where the village is less able to cope with
its anti-social members, where economic, social and cultural deprivation are
winning out over the traditional qualities of 'stoic cheerfulness, the
unassuming generosity and gallantry'.
He has an unashamedly sentimental view of the old society: the knocking-up
slate by the front door so the 'carler' could wake the men for the first
shift; the great-grandfather who did not allow his back to be washed because
that was the source of his strength; the role of the Primitive Methodists in
the early 19th century; the 'wands' of the under-managers; the constant
danger, and the utterly limited expectations of the men who risked their
lives every day.
It is an ill-organised, sometimes exasperating tale of a nine-month journey
back into family history, but Hudson writes well and he knows the nature of
his task, which is to raise a memorial to his forebears. That is worth a
book.
'Of course, it had been awful. One knew it had been awful. But the awfulness
had all been part of the richness, and, dare one even think it, the romance
of that world . . .' And by the end he has discovered that the coal seams
were not 18 inches but nearer three feet high.

THE REVIEWS THAT CAUSED A RUMPUS by Brian Sewell Bloomsbury Pounds 12.99,
357 pages
I do not read regularly Brian Sewell's reviews as art critic of the London
Evening Standard. It is not that I cannot abide them, although there are
certainly many that feel that way; it is just that I live in Scotland, and
visit London only about once a week. Invariably on my return journeys I buy
Brian's newspaper, and largely because of his reviews, which are at once
shriekingly funny and utterly exasperating. What singles them out from
almost all the others is that here we really do have a scholarly,
well-informed art historian and connoisseur, writing articulate and
thought-provoking stylish prose.
Of course Brian Sewell adores to be provocative and controversial. And he is
feared. He is feared because he cannot be crushed, bludgeoned or packaged by
cliques of the contemporary Art Establishment who club so closely together
to force him, and indeed the rest of us, to believe in and worship so many
of their idols. Brian exclaims, albeit in tones rather too shrill and
fluting, that they are 'false gods' and, often, he is right.
The delight of reading the odd review of Sewell's, or indeed listening to
him broadcasting, is that you are subjected to Sewell's wit, mannerisms and
hang-ups in palatably short bursts. But 100 reviews on 357 pages of Brian
Sewell's unadulterated ire and froth is far too rich, I suspect, for most of
us to digest in one read. This is a book to dip into.
The key problem is that not only can Sewell not abide fellow critic Waldemar
Januszczak - I quote: 'Pupils of Johannes Wilde will be relieved to find him
omitted from this farce; had Mr Januszczak read Wilde's lecture on the
Sistine Ceiling, he would have been compelled to recognise that his own
ruminations on the subject, even after restoration, are puerile and
superfluous, their publication a tiresome, self-indulgent, masturbatory
display' - but also that he tilts at almost everything else: the Royal
Academy, the Arts Council, photography as an art form (in particular the
very talented Annie Leibovitz), the Turner Prize, Tony Caro, Gilbert and
George; indeed the list is unending.
Sewell feels obliged to discredit everything and everybody so that we are
forced, out of empathy or fellow-feeling, to defend his multitude of targets
and are in real danger of overlooking his penetrating observations and
palpable hits. He plays to the gallery, which is 'standing-room only' full
of philistines, and they embrace him for appearing to share in their
prejudices. This goes some way to explaining his two Press Awards as 'Critic
of the Year'.
Were Brian to pause and be a little kinder and more generous (which he is
capable of being), I suspect not only would he be taken more seriously but
his harsh criticisms would then appear more justifiable and deadly.
Timothy Clifford is the director of Scottish National Galleries.

FOOTBALL AND THE COMMONS PEOPLE edited by David Bull and Alastair Campbell
Juma Printing and Publishing Pounds 9.95, 317 pages
With Westminster knee-deep in sleaze allegations, you might think this was
not the time for the minister responsible for the Child Support Agency to
confess to having a mistress.
Still less a 'bewitching' mistress. And the disclosure that she dresses in
red and wears dark stockings will surely make eyes pop at many a
Conservative constituency association.
Happily, the mistress in question goes by the name of Manchester United and
Alistair Burt is owning up merely to the occasional tryst at her Old
Trafford love-nest. Readers may find it in themselves to forgive this lapse
if they consider that Burt's first footballing love is lowly Bury.
Burt's is one of the more entertaining contributions in an intriguing
collection of football writing by 30 current and former MPs. The compilation
 -a fund-raising exercise for the Child Poverty Action Group - consists
mainly of the MPs, including three cabinet ministers, reminiscing about
their favourite teams in unashamedly partisan terms.
All the main parties are represented and there is a particularly strong
Scottish contingent, with contributions covering soccer rivalries in
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. Issues like the Taylor report and the advent
of football's premiership are recurrent themes. The collection was co-edited
by Alastair Campbell, the Burnley-mad personal press spokesman to Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
The quality is uneven but the volume contains some gems and could be a rich
source for collectors of footballing-cum-political trivia. How many knew,
for example, that chancellor Ken Clarke thought it a 'dreadful mistake' for
Nottingham Forest to let Lee Chapman go? Or that home secretary Michael
Howard's all-time favourite player was 'probably' Steve Heighway, the
Liverpool winger of the 1970s?
Hands up those who were aware that Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
received what he calls his 'introduction to market forces' trying to sell
programmes outside Raith Rovers' ground in Kirkcaldy. And that Mike Gapes,
Labour MP for Ilford South, used to deliver Geoff Hurst's, and sometimes
Bobby Moore's, papers. Tantalisingly, he fails to tell us which titles the
great men ordered.
The chapters that work best are those with the vividest personal memories.
Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North, conveys a convincing sense of
the addictiveness of fandom in his account of supporting Falkirk. 'My life
sentence dates back to 1956-57,' he writes. 'The constant fear of the charge
of betrayal keeps me hooked.'
Peter Snape, Labour MP for West Bromwich East, writes of 'agonising' days as
a railway worker at two signal boxes behind Stockport County's ground. 'From
the No. 1 box I could see only half the pitch (invariably the wrong half),
while No. 2 was immediately behind the pie stall and, although I could hear
the roars, I could not see any of the action.'
Roy Hattersley, former Labour deputy leader, describes singing away the
Saturday afternoons at Sheffield Wednesday 'through mouthfuls of Nuttalls'
Mintoes.' The Owls, he predicts, will always remain a different sort of big
club: 'Scampi, the real sign of football stardom, will be kept to an
absolute minimum.'
On a less whimsical note, the Tory MP David Evans contributes an insightful
account of his stint as a director of Luton Town - a period which saw the
installation of an artificial surface at the club's ground and the
imposition of a ban on away fans. An England youth international and former
professional with Aston Villa, Evans turns out to be something of a prophet
of doom. He predicts the re-emergence of hooliganism and suggests that the
game is dying as a consequence of too many 'unsuitable' chairmen, 'poor'
managers and 'greedy - very greedy' players.
If this week's newspaper stories accusing a leading professional goalkeeper
of accepting bribes to fix matches turn out to be true, more people may be
inclined to agree with this gloomy prognosis.
Deadly serious too is Alan Simpson's attack on what he calls 'Everton's
lamentable record on black players.' 'A club cheats only itself and its fans
when it cannot recognise such a rich seam of possibilities when the seam
isn't white,' the Labour MP for Nottingham South writes.
It will be interesting to hear what Simpson thinks of Everton's sacking this
week of Mike Walker, the manager who enjoyed such success with Norwich City.
I should end by declaring an interest: it was an inch-perfect Alistair Burt
corner that led to me registering my first goal of the season in a match
against the Conservative party last month. Unfortunately it was an own goal.
Did this influence my decision to start this review with a reference to his
'mistress'? To borrow the catchphrase with which he ends his chapter: 'You
may think so. I could not possibly comment.'

consciousness debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SHADOWS OF THE MIND by Roger Penrose Oxford University Press Pounds 19.99,
457 pages
One of the greatest mysteries facing science and philosophy is the
phenomenon of consciousness. How do three-dimensional technicolour pictures
arise inside our skulls? How do we explain the perception of scents and
sounds? How does the excitation of neurons result in belief, memory, reason?
Three centuries ago Rene Descartes declared that the problem was best solved
by being ignored, and there are some philosophers today who agree with him.
They argue that the supreme difficulty of the problem is a result of the
fact that the human mind just is not built to understand its own basis -
rather like the impossibility of an eyeball seeing itself. Fortunately the
pessimists are in the minority, and an exciting worldwide programme of
debate and research continues.
Roger Penrose, who is a professor of mathematics at Oxford, is one of the
leading contributors to that debate. In his previous and much applauded book
The Emperor's New Mind he attacked currently fashionable attempts to explain
consciousness by thinking of the brain as a computer, and argued instead
that something quite new is needed in science to give us the materials for
an explanation. In this book he tells us what that new something might be.
To attack the 'computational model' of mind is a significant matter, because
upon it turn two important related hopes. One is that we will one day build
computers powerful enough to be genuinely intelligent, and the other is that
the way to understand consciousness is to disentangle the enormous
complexity of the brain's billions of internal connections - a task of great
practical difficulty, but not in principle impossible.
Penrose argues that the computational model cannot explain consciousness,
and especially the all-important conscious phenomenon of 'understanding.'
The reason lies in the notion of 'computation' itself. As the term suggests,
computation is what computers do. It consists in the ordered running of
specified procedures, even in the case of 'bottom-up' systems which can
teach themselves and thus modify and evolve as they go along. In Penrose's
view, even the most sophisticated computational models cannot simulate
consciousness for the good reason that the latter has something
fundamentally non-computational about it. In the first part of his book he
explains what this means. In the second he tries to identify
non-computational features of the human brain's activity.
It is crucial for Penrose that 'non-computational' should not be taken to
denote something mystical or non-scientific. He believes that consciousness
can be understood by science - but that it will have to be an extended
science: one which includes new ways of thinking about the 'intermediate
level' between the microscopic world described by quantum physics, and the
everyday world of ordinary objects described by classical physics. This is
the topic of the book's second part, where Penrose explores new ways of
thinking about the connections between brain-cells - the synapses - the
proposal being that they behave in non-computational ways describable only
by laws intermediate between the quantum and classical levels.
There is a great deal of challenging mathematics and science in this book.
Penrose's argument against the computational model of mind turns on a
particular application of the famous theorem discovered in 1930 by the Czech
mathematician Kurt Godel, which proves that no set of rules for proving
propositions in some formal system can ever be sufficient to establish all
the true propositions of that system. Penrose takes Godel to have shown that
no set of proof-rules can ever prove all those propositions of, say,
arithmetic which humans can know to be true. From this it follows that
'there must be more to human thinking than can ever be achieved by a
computer.'
There is such a wealth of scientific, mathematical and philosophical ideas
in Penrose's book - all presented with extraordinary clarity, in a mixture
of straight discussion, fables, dialogues and diagrams - that debate about
the merits of its arguments promises to be extensive. But Penrose is
offering a genuine attempt to advance understanding of the complex questions
which surround consciousness, and even if his colleagues remain unpersuaded
by the more speculative arguments in physics and physiology in the book's
second part, there is much in the first part which those who favour the
computational approach are going to have to think about very hard indeed.
Whether or not one is persuaded by Penrose's arguments, reading them gives
one a highly absorbing education in much contemporary science and philosophy
at their sharpest cutting edges.

THE SECRET LIFE OF LASZLO, COUNT DRACULA by Roderick Anscombe Bloomsbury
Pounds 15.99, 409 pages
In Pharaoh's Army is the sequel to the much-lauded autobiographical This
Boy's Life, but it is also an outstanding addition to the library on the
Vietnam War. Appropriately enough for a book composed a quarter of a century
after the events the prose has a cool poise and, compared with the frenzy of
Michael Herr's Dispatches or the brutality of Larry Heinemann's fiction,
seems almost gentle and unAmerican.
Tobias Wolff drifted into the army, the Special Forces and then the Officer
Candidate School - a course he only managed to pass because of his talents
in managing the graduation night revue. 'They kept me on to produce a farce.
That's how I became an officer in the United States Army.' There are other
passages that are so symbolic that they would invite derision if featured in
a novel: Wolff leads his men on a parachute jump that puts them smack in the
middle of a rubbish dump, for example.
Despite being a Green Beret, In Pharaoh's Army demonstrates that Wolff was
as gung-ho as Franz Kafka ('I was completely incompetent to lead a Special
Forces team,' he confides in the opening pages). Fortunately for him,
because of his knowledge of Vietnamese ('like a seven-year-old with a
freakish military vocabulary') he finds himself posted as adviser to a South
Vietnamese artillery unit, where he spends a not too-combative year getting
a big enough television to enjoy Bonanza and saving dogs from Vietnamese
barbecues until the Tet offensive bloodily lumbers up to his quarters. The
figures are well-known: imbecile officers, all-knowing sergeants, wily
natives - Wolff makes it so funny, moving and memorable you feel it has
never been written about before.
Carlo Gebler's The Cure takes brutality of the hearthside variety as its
theme. His novel, set in rural 19th century Ireland, relates how Bridget
Cleary ends up being doused with paraffin and set alight by her doting
husband, who then shoves her into the grate to smoulder away. All this while
her family and assorted acquaintances stand around.
It is a tribute to Gebler's skill that this climactic immolation seems
inevitable: 'rules were rules and as the creature must have known there was
always a right of recourse to fire'. Michael Cleary is not murdering his
wife, but eliminating a fairy changeling in order to recover her.
The whole book revolves around beliefs, whether of the superstitious or
motivating variety - Gebler rips open the heads of all the characters.
Bridget herself helps to build the superstructure of superstition that
dominates village life. 'From the moment you pricked your finger,' she says
to her cousin shortly before her death, 'I knew there was going to be bad
news coming'.
In its prose The Cure is clear and spare, in its horrific depiction of a
woman executed by her nearest and dearest only comparable to Freidoune
Sahebjam's La Femme Lapide. First rate, but not a book likely to be promoted
by the Irish Tourist Board.
Mention of Proust on the first page of a novel is usually a bad sign, but
Lorrie Moore is too good at brevity and too contemptuous of the French to
commit any Proustian sins. Who Will Run the Frog Hospital? has the narrator,
Berie, picking over her adolescence, but the style is punchy and at 148
pages is really two collided short stories (Moore is one of the finest short
story writers in the US) rather than a novel.
The substance of this witty and poetic book is Berie's friendship with Sils,
who works with her at an amusement park for pocket money; we get a portrait
of intimacy, mooching in clubs, an elegy for teenage kicks. Incidents are
few: Sils gets pregnant, Berie pilfers money for an abortion, gets caught,
gets sent to a Baptist summer camp. Moore renders this through superb
one-liners and a great gift for creating mood.
One of the most poignant elements of In Pharaoh's Army is the death of
Wolff's friend, Hugh Pierce. Lorrie Moore powerfully shows how you do not
need a war to lose a close friend. Loss and irretrievability permeate both
works.
The Secret Life of Laszlo, Count Dracula is, as the title suggests, a Magyar
Psycho. Laszlo, scion of a noble Hungarian family, leaves Transylvania to
study medicine in Paris. Enjoying the fleshpots of the city, he slashes the
throat of a demimondaine and flees. Back at the ancestral seat 20 years
later, as the reader may have guessed, he discovers that killing women and
drinking their blood is his bag. Bonus sub-plot involving Hungarian
nationalists plotting against Austrian domination. Readable tosh, the only
notable thing about this is that it is written by an assistant professor at
Harvard Medical School who works with the criminally insane. Sadly this
Dracula does not get beyond the elementary beast within.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: Master Builder - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING

<TEXT>
The actor Brian Cox has made no secret of the fact that his real life is
strikingly similar to that of the central character in Ibsen's The Master
Builder.
On stage he plays Halvard Solness, a man in late middle age who is
captivated by the young Hilde Wangel; offstage he lives with Siri Neal, an
actress 27 years his junior who plays Hilda Wangel in this production.
It may sound risky or even claustrophobic but Cox's position is entirely in
keeping with the spirit of the play which is itself a daring act of
self-analysis.
Ibsen wrote this late psychological drama partly in response to his own
predicament: at 61 his life was shaken by meeting the 18-year-old Emilie
Bardach, a meeting that proved both an inspiration and a scourge.
Brian Cox, given a free hand at the Edinburgh Lyceum where this production
originated, deliberately chose to produce this play, hoping to bring to it
his own personal experience.
It certainly pays dividends; his performance is totally compelling,
penetrating and vital and he mines all the possibilities in Ibsen's complex
exploration of self-doubt and idealism.
Ibsen's play calls for a mature understanding.
Like many of his masterpieces, it is maddeningly patchy. At its heart is a
painfully honest account of fear - fear of ageing, fear of failure, fear of
retribution from God.
Yet it is full of booby-traps for a modern cast. In the midst of believable
dialogue it suddenly becomes stilted, seeming almost to stutter to a halt in
places; among profound insights into human behaviour comes to our ears
heavy-handed, sometimes ludicrous symbolism. Cox and his director John
Crowley find their answer to this by sprinkling the production liberally
with humour.
It is surprisingly funny, which heads off some of the problems. By the time
we get to talk of trolls, demons and castles in the air, we have laughed
enough not to giggle and Cox has made his Solness pompous, arrogant but
desperate enough for us to understand why he grasps at the fantasies Hilde
offers him.
This Solness has a Glasgow accent and is clearly the self-made man -
brusque, jovial and terrified of being discovered.
It is easy to see why he falls for Hilde's flattery and is pricked by her
taunting. Cox and Neal manage the nuances of this relationship skilfully,
making it clear that the crisis her arrival precipitates is just as much
spiritual as physical.
Neal's Hilde is at first attractively forthright, but gradually her desire
to drive Solness to face the truth about himself appears arrogant and
selfish.
The production is rather slow off the blocks, and sometimes oddly paced, but
the performances are thoughtful and pleasing.
Andy McEwan is strong as the tight-lipped apprentice whose talent Solness is
trying to suppress; John Fraser is amusing as the self-contained doctor, who
conveys how much he knows with the slight twitch of an eyebrow.
And Morag Hood is fascinating as Solness's long-suffering wife. Pretty,
patient and all-seeing, she appears at first to shame Solness with her
decency, but as the evening wears on it becomes clear that she has trapped
both of them with her sense of guilt and her inability to cast off the cloak
of the sweet-natured martyr.
The evening, however, really belongs to Cox whose tormented dynamic
performance drives the play forward.
The masterbuilder may scale the height of his steeple and then fall off; Cox
manages to hold on tight.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The rise and rise of a shrewd operator - In a
profession where fools rush in, the conductor Kent Nagano has trodden very
carefully indeed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are powerful days for Kent Nagano. A decade after arriving in Europe
as an unknown Japanese-American conductor, he cuts one of the most glamorous
profiles in today's image-conscious music world.
As music director of the Opera de Lyon since 1989, he has played a key role
in developing its international reputation and progressive repertoire. He is
also revitalising Britain's oldest symphony orchestra, the Halle, which he
conducts on Thursday in his first Manchester concert of the season.
Appointed principal conductor two years ago, he has only just begun to make
an imprint on its programmes. In 18 months, he hopes to lead the Halle into
Manchester's new Pounds 42m concert hall.
In a profession where fools rush in, Nagano has trodden carefully. He has
avoided the core classical repertoire, exposing himself only in 20th century
scores which show his analytical grasp and communication skills to
advantage. For his London debut a decade ago, he conducted Frank Zappa. In
Salzburg, he has given lucid performances of Messiaen and Stravinsky. He
champions John Adams' minimalist music on both sides of the Atlantic. But he
has yet to convince large sections of the music business. 'There's too much
plastic,' says one agent, pointing out that Nagano has yet to conduct major
works by Mozart, Verdi and Wagner. 'I think the shine from outside is better
than what is inside.'
Nagano is certainly an image-maker's dream. With his oriental features and
shoulder-length hair, he wows audiences wherever he goes. In Manchester, he
introduces complex modern scores in his soft Californian accent. In
interviews he talks like a campus guru, articulating artistic goals as
'visions and dreams'. 'Music is a sharing experience', he says.
But with Nagano music is rarely a great emotional experience, or one of
spontaneous inspiration. Some orchestral musicians have likened him to a
machine: he rehearses and re-rehearses, demands clockwork precision and
leaves nothing to chance. 'He's a recording producer's dream - he conducts
it exactly the same way every time,' says a member of the Lyon orchestra.
Nagano, 42, whose Japanese grandparents emigrated to California 70 years
ago, carries many traits of his mixed cultural background. He practises the
martial art of Shintaido and married a Japanese pianist. He is a modernist
who speaks of his regard for tradition, an artist with an understanding of
market value, a man with big long-term ambitions who has calculated every
step of his career.
His introduction to Europe came through the French composer Olivier
Messiaen. Nagano, who grew up on a Californian artichoke farm, was
conducting Messiaen's music at Berkeley, and invited the composer to work
with his orchestra. Messiaen was impressed. He brought the young conductor
to Paris in 1983 to help prepare the world premiere of his opera Saint
Francois d'Assise. Messiaen introduced Nagano to artists' agent, Sylvio
Samama, who saw in him a talent worth nurturing. Once his reputation was
established, Nagano walked out on the agency and has never looked back. He
is now said to command around Pounds 15,000 per concert.
Lyon and the Halle were shrewdly chosen. In both cases, Nagano could be
guaranteed a certain amount of limelight, without the competitive
environment of Paris or London. Both had secure artistic foundations and
vast untapped potential.
In Lyon, the Opera was in the midst of a seven-year nomadic existence while
its home was rebuilt. The situation was a godsend for an operatic ingenu
like Nagano. He was able to rehearse and record extensively, choosing the
kind of exotic repertoire which would generate publicity but no unfavourable
comparisons.
Louis Erlo and Jean-Pierre Brossmann, the Opera's co-directors, offered
experience, media introductions and a handsome budget. Nagano was their
conduit to high musical standards and a younger audience. In terms of
personality, Nagano was perfect for Lyon's new high-tech Opera building,
which opened in May last year. His Lyon recordings have won international
awards, and he has now been invited to take the company on tour to San
Francisco and New York.
In Manchester, too, Nagano invested in an organisation at a low point in its
fortunes. The Halle had a worldwide reputation, but was not of worldwide
quality. Eclipsed by orchestras in Birmingham and Liverpool, it needed
awakening from the sleepy conservatism into which it had lapsed since the
death of Sir John Barbirolli in 1970.
At first sight, Nagano was a strange choice. He was barely known in
Manchester, and his repertoire had little in common with the Halle's. The
two have taken time to adjust to each other. Nagano plunged in with Boulez
and Stockhausen, which did not go down well in Bradford and Sheffield. He
tampered with the money-spinning formula for Manchester's summer Proms,
which then made a loss. He made disparaging comments about the orchestra's
recent past, denting the musicians' pride.
He also clashed with David Richardson, the chief executive who recruited
him. The Halle's board of directors sided with Nagano, and Richardson left
two months ago. The orchestra is now being run by Alan Dean, a Mancunian
businessman with fund-raising experience, who says his priorities are to
raise Nagano's profile in the community, increase corporate sponsorship and
reduce the Halle's Pounds 400,000 deficit.
No-one doubts that Nagano was the right man to shake up the Halle. His
predecessor, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski, improved playing standards, but had no
public face. Nagano, by contrast, is a crowd-puller - a key factor in the
orchestra's move to the new hall. Nagano talks knowledgeably of the Halle
tradition, which he summarises as 'excellence, innovation and courage. We
have to redefine the tradition, renourish it, refocus it toward the future.'
Critics say the orchestra is sounding refreshed. Nagano has worked hard on
technical aspects - 'almost to the point of putting the players off,' says
Gerald Larner, who has followed the Halle's fortunes since the Barbirolli
era. 'The sound has become smoother, softer - the kind of thing you need for
John Adams. But there hasn't been the same degree of artistic illumination
and inspiration.'
Nagano says there should be no hasty judgments. 'We all agreed from the
beginning that this was a long-term commitment, something with roots that
are going to bring benefits far into the future, and will require patience.
I really feel I'm laying the bricks, assembling the structure.'
The conservative programmes for the current season - plugging important gaps
in both Nagano's and the Halle's repertoire - suggest he recognises the need
for consolidation. Next March and April, they will make the first of a
projected series of recordings. There will be a festival to open the new
hall in May 1996, before Nagano's contract comes up for renewal. 'I've no
doubt he'll use the Halle as a stepping stone - he's a clever operator',
says Larner. 'He's not going to spend a lifetime here, and he would be well
advised not to. But if he can pull the orchestra round, it sets him up for
life for other things.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Serious Money): Welcome to a brighter Weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of Weekend Money as a separate section allows us to offer readers
two complementary services: an extended review of the financial highlights
of the past week, and a more consistent analysis of investment and savings.
Both services are bolstered by many more statistics and charts.
This page summarises the main financial stories of the past week, and it
pulls together the financial indicators of most use for personal investors.
Market Week helps you check developments in the main UK and overseas stock
markets. FT-SE winners and losers picks out companies on the move - big,
medium and small - and the leading and lagging stock market sectors.
If you have a portfolio of individual shares, you can - as always - find
their prices in the London Share Service at the back of the main newspaper.
But our new tables then help you to check your shares' performance against
other companies of a similar size: if it is a blue chip, check it against
the Footsie 100 index; if it is a small company, the FT-SE Small Cap or
Hoare Govett Smaller Companies index are better yardsticks.
Our list of popular shares shows the latest price movements and allows you
to calculate your profit (or loss) since the original launch.
People's financial needs and interests change during their lifetime. So, we
have tried to make it easy for you to find the topics relevant to you, now,
by signposting the different subjects clearly. Our main categories are
Markets, Companies, Investing for Growth, Investing for Income, Saving and
Borrowing, and Financial Planning.
If you want more detail on the latest developments in the main stock
markets, turn to Page 2 where we analyse both London and Wall Street every
week. We will also be highlighting one other market or sector in the news.
This week, for example, we weigh up oil shares in the light of this week's
go-ahead for the new Foinaven oilfield, west of Shetland. And the American
investment guru, John Train, is the first expert in our new guest column,
'In the Pink'.
We are expanding substantially our analysis of UK company news (pages 4-6),
with regular coverage of bids, coming results, and new issues. And each week
 -in 'Pick of Lex' - we will be reproducing a handful of company analyses
which have appeared in the influential Lex column during the week.
Many types of investment can be used both to secure capital growth and to
provide an income to live on. But investors need to be clear whether they
are aiming for growth or income. So, we are dividing our investment pages by
objective rather than type of investment.
Shares, unit trusts and investment trusts can all fall under the growth tag
(Page 6), depending on their individual characteristics. Far Eastern stock
markets or small companies, for instance, appeal mainly to growth investors
and offer a negligible current income. Fringe 'investments' such as gold
bullion or art are patently suitable only for growth investors, since they
offer no income.
Many people think instinctively of bank and building society deposits when
the word 'income' is mentioned. But the range of income-producing
investments is far wider.
On Page 7 we list the main types and will be discussing them in more detail
in future weeks. We are also publishing regular tables of gilts suitable for
different types of taxpayer, and prices of building society permanent
interest-bearing shares (Pibs).
Our existing table of the best deposit rates caters for the most cautious
type of income investors - savers. From this week, we are complementing it
with another table showing the best borrowing rates, including mortgages,
personal loans, overdrafts and credit cards.
Financial planning is an enormous subject, and our financial planning page
(9) will range from basic investment and tax planning, to pensions,
annuities and employee share schemes. Briefcase (on Page 8) will continue to
answer readers' problems.
Our new unit and investment trust statistics (Page 10) allow you to check
the performance of your units and investment trust shares against the best
of those in the same sector. We have ranked the funds on their performance
over the past three years. Other yardsticks include yield, and volatility -
a measure which gives you an indication of how risky a fund is.
Do remember, though, that performance figures are of historic interest only:
they are not predictions of future performance, let alone recommendations.
Last - but just as important - we hope you find Weekend Money enjoyable as
well as useful. Making the most of your assets can be fun.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: Love on wheels - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are 20,000 of them on the roads, they are built like little tanks,
they do 'nought to 60 in a fortnight', their batteries weigh about a ton,
and their drivers will not have a word said against them. They are, of
course, the electric milk floats which hum around our streets at dawn,
providing Britain's unique - though steadily shrinking - doorstep delivery
service. They were the subject of last night's Perpetual Motion on BBC2, one
of those quiet little documentary series on quirky subjects which pass by
many of us most of the time, but give disproportionate satisfaction to
enthusiasts. It is this sort of programme which so often achieves a
'Reaction Index' (the degree of enthusiasm expressed to pollsters) way
beyond those of more glitzy programmes with bigger audiences.
In this six-part series, produced by Emma Willis at BBC Bristol, we have
already seen programmes on the Ford Transit van, the American Airstream
caravan, and Concorde, as well as the milk float. Next week's subject is the
Ferguson TE 20 tractor, known as 'Little Grey Fergie', and the series ends
with 30 minutes on the Douglas DC-3, better known as the Dakota, an
aeroplane which inspires among its keener supporters panegyrics which come
close to declarations of love. That is the key to these programmes. They
work best when the producers find enthusiasts whose fanatic dedication pours
from them uncontrollably. Conversely they are least successful, or anyway
least fun to watch, when they are closest to the conventional documentary
formula of history/statistics/newsreel extract and so on.
Thus the least entertaining so far was last week's Concorde programme, which
felt a bit like a schools' broadcast on transport. There was talk about
Anglo-French co-operation in the design and manufacture, and stories from
the test pilots, all of which seemed familiar from other programmes. There
was a hint of Perpetual Motion's characteristic tang when the air hostess
explained the difficulty of getting meals served in the early days, with
passengers so busy having their photographs taken beside the 'Mach 2'
digital read-out on the cabin bulkhead. But there was all too little of
that. What we needed were besotted passengers: the reminiscences of David
Frost or that pencil manufacturer who is in the Guiness Book Of Records as
the greatest user of Concorde. Nobody described what it felt like to
overtake the sun.
On the other hand people of all kinds described their love affairs with (of
all things) the Ford Transit van, which was, consequently, the subject of
the most successful programme so far. The Transit won equal plaudits from
policemen and bank robbers, one of whom explained that, as robberies got
bigger in the 1960s, a Jaguar was no longer any good. You could not cram
four or five crooks and four or five bags of swag in a Jag, whereas a
Transit did very nicely - and concealed you from the law, too. On similar
grounds a policeman reckoned Transits made ideal surveillance vehicles,
arguing that there were so many around that nobody noticed those concealing
police observers. The bank robber grinned and claimed you could always see
them rocking on their springs as the coppers moved about inside.
Abiding affection is an attractive emotion which makes for pleasant viewing,
even when it is being bestowed upon some ancient vehicle - and few things in
life seem to inspire quite such depths of affection as old vehicles. The
Ferguson tractor went out of production 40 years ago and yet next week's
programme - one of the best - tracks down a farmer and his two sons who have
one each and use them all the time. Perpetual Motion is really a series of
love stories.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The sound service - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE

<TEXT>
As my colleague Christopher Dunkley will bear out, when wearing his
presenter's hat for Feedback, nowhere is the Senior Service (radio) more
conscious of its dignity than on Radio 4. Listening numbers may be down but
R4's public is passionately loyal and fiercely articulate. A weekend
housebound with flu gave me a chance to realise how far Reithian gravitas is
now concentrated in this station, more recognisably the old Home Service
than Radio 3 is the once world-famous Third. Caviar to the general,
possibly, but R4 is BBC Radio's flagship - middle-class, mature audience and
all - whether the Corporation likes it or not.
The endemic BBC faults are there, of course: you come across conceit and
complacency, the cosy and the commonplace. Frank Delaney's French Lit
series, Journeys to Imaginary Places, told us little about Flaubert or
Colette but much about Frank Delaney, his schoolboy French and his
patronisingly unremarkable perceptions. Kaleidoscope too often trawls the
dowdy reaches of outer academe to produce non-confidence-inspiring
'experts', too often massaged by the breathily bland Natalie Wheen.
Serious programmes can be hijacked by frivolousness, as in last Saturday's
Today. Tony Banks MP, mystifyingly regarded as a wag, witlessly gibbered
about lavatory bowls in an otherwise intriguing item on the black economy in
domestic work. His attitude boiled down, dismayingly, to an apparent blend
of paranoia and old-fashioned snobbery, incomprehensible to any continental
European.
But at least Radio 4 reminds us of the union of which we are part, unlike
the bulk of British popular culture that operates under the impression that
we are the 51st state of a union lying in another direction. Saturday's
regular Europhile is a jewel in R4's treasury.
The test of a station's quality lies in its normal output, the basic
programmes, taken for granted. Saturday's Money Box has won the Bradford and
Bingley Award for the best programme on personal finance on radio or TV.
File on 4 took a trenchant look at the one in eight of the working
population now self-employed. Analysis (Sunday) examined how the appeal of
communitarianism (yes, the word exists) cuts across political boundaries,
both left and right endorsing the philosophical clout of 'the community'.
George Walden warned of apple-pie pietism, an imagined Betjemanesque
suburbia or idealised working-class. It looks as if the community may
survive in an age of mobile phones, dormitory suburbs and kids who play with
computers not one another: rather chillingly, people will not have friends
any more, they will have networks.
They will also have the media. Sunday's Mediumwave still falls between too
many stools. A report from Italy on the trial-by-journalism of the murderous
'monster of Florence' was the sort of item infinitely better done by the
excellent From Our Own Correspondent. Mediumwave is still presented by a
media lady not too hot on interviewing, taking cues or reading a script (her
reference to Mrs Kenneth Clarke's 'matronly bum' for 'bun' has passed into
radio history).
Radio 4's strengths extend to the quirky, the off-beat. Alan Cox's reading
of Barry Pilton's Chocolate Nuns and Firebombs (Saturday) cheerfully evokes
Paris in 1968 when it was bliss to be alive and to be young was very
exhausting. Dylan Winter continues his Sunday teatime adventures with his
barge and horse, sturdy Molly, meeting positively Dickensian canal-side
folk. Last week he came across the farriers' closed shop (can't tighten a
nail in another smith's shoe) and a lugubrious tunnel-keeper who misdirected
him, let Molly cut herself and lacked a lavatory. Tony Banks would approve.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The hidden Orientalists - William Packer on the
Impressionist treasures of an astute Egyptian collector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
That artists from the west travelled into the Moslem and Arab world, from
Morocco in the west to Persia in the east, is a commonplace of the art
history of the 19th century. Hard upon the rediscovery of relics of the
civilisations of the ancient world far beyond the confines of the old Grand
Tour, they were drawn inevitably by those living civilisations, no less
ancient, through which they had to pass. There they tasted that heady
mixture of the exotic and the refined, the cultured and the barbaric, the
sympathetic and the alien, that altogether was irresistible.
There was Delacroix off to Algeria, there Ingres with his bourgeois
fantasies of life in the harem. Off went Edward Lear to the Holy Land, JF
Lewis went native in Cairo, Gerome and Fromentin, Girardet and Guillaumet
headed into the desert with the caravan. Back they came, those Orientalists,
with their images of desert and harem, souk and bazaar, to great immediate
success. And if their work then fell out of favour, in our own time we have
seen it wonderfully restored to fashion in the auction house and the
princely Arab eye.
Even a lifetime ago it might have been expected that Arab curiosity would be
engaged by such stuff, as much for its romantic licence and misapprehension
as for any documentary value. To learn now that representative examples of
the work of such as Leon Belly, Eugene Fromentin and Jean-Leon Gerome have
been sitting in a museum in Cairo all this time, is not altogether a
surprise.
No. The surprise is to learn that this inter-cultural traffic also went on
the other way. But then we forget that Egypt, francophone and francophile in
her educated classes, had been under the close influence of France for the
better part of a century before the British assumed the mandate in 1917.
In 1908, Prince Youssef Kamal had set up a School of Fine Art in Cairo on
the French model. This was followed, 15 years later, by the establishment of
a Society of Friends of Art under the patronage of the prince himself and
one of the ministers of the time, Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil, who had a
French wife, was a great collector of western art and, in the 1920s,
extremely active in the Paris market when works of the highest quality were
still reasonably cheap - Samuel Courtauld was similarly astute.
Khalil's collection was to form the basis of the national collection when
the Cairo Museum of Modern Art was set up in 1931. After the Nasser
revolution of 1952, the royal collections were taken over and have been in
the Guezireh Museum since 1957. So not only have the Orientalists been in
Cairo since the 1920s, but also works of the highest quality by many of the
masters of 19th century French painting, from Delacroix and Ingres to
Gauguin, Renoir and Degas, with some good sculpture into the bargain,
including Barye, Bourdelle and Rodin.
There they have been, and there forgotten, les Oublies indeed, and quietly
suffering dreadfully by modern conservation standards in the Egyptian
climate. Hence this exhibition, for the programme of restoration has been
undertaken by l'Association Francaise d'Action Artistique.
The gaps are interesting - no Cezanne, no Manet, no Matisse, no Picasso -
but hardly culpable in the face of the many lovely things that were
acquired. The small reclining 'Odalisque' by Ingres, looking back over her
shoulder, is magnificent, and the small Courbet nude, lying in the stream,
is hardly less seductive. There is a delightful run of Sisleys, fine late
Monets including a 'Nympheas' and a view of Westminster near Cleopatra's
Needle, a self-portrait by the young Degas and a monumental drawing of a
woman washing her hair, an extraordinary 'Cricket Match at Bedford Park' by
Pissarro, and some fine riverscapes by Daubigny. As good as any are two
Gauguins of the 1880s, the one of two symbolic nudes upon a beach, 'La Vie
et la Mort', the other just a path through the trees.
Lesser artists too are represented at their very best - a Moreau 'Salome', a
Cazin 'Boatyard', a reaper reaping by Bastien-Lepage, a fishing fleet by
Cottet, Regnault's 'Patio at Tangiers'. But there is no need to pick the
plums, for not one of near 120 is without its interest.
Les Oublies du Caire - masterpieces from Cairo museums: Musee d'Orsay, Paris
7me, until January 8.

not start making grants until late next year.
COMPANIES
The cost of cutting prices and jobs held back revenues and profitability at
British Telecommunications in the first six months of the year.
TeleWest, the largest UK cable operator, pushed ahead with flotation plans
with a pathfinder prospectus suggesting a total value for the company of
between Pounds 1.25bn and Pounds 1.45bn.

North West Water announced a wide-ranging review review of its activities,
which will mean continued job losses.
The Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest investing institution, is

Burton, the clothing retail group that includes Debenhams, Burtons and
Dorothy Perkins, more than doubled profits last year despite falling into

the US election. It broke the 3,100 level by Thursday's close, but retreated
on Friday.
Broadly-based selling in Tokyo depressed equities on Thursday as a decline
in speculative stocks and privatised issues prompted arbitrage-linked sales.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 159.03 lower at 19,264.85.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: Gold rush fever as lottery launched - Queues are
forming for a share of the expected windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday the tickets go on sale for the National Lottery, and by next
Saturday the nation will be welcoming a new millionaire. It will be another
four months, however, before the other certain beneficiaries of the lottery,
the nation's arts companies, collect their windfalls.
Although the Arts Council, which is processing the applications for the
extra funding that the lottery provides, receives its first first weekly
cheque from Camelot, the organisers, on Tuesday November 22, it does not
expect to pass on any money until April. In the meantime the accumulating
pool, which should average Pounds 250m a year for the arts during the seven
years of Camelot's contract, will be adding millions in tax free interest.
Jeremy Newton, lottery director at the council, has chosen a
steady-as-she-goes approach. Although there has been pilot research and dry
runs, the council is not sending out guidelines to prospective applicants
until the end of the month. It expects the first completed proposals to
arrive by January 4. Then the assessments will begin, with the first
successful companies hearing the good news at the end of March, with more
approvals announced monthly.
The lottery will transform the arts in the UK. The anticipated sum to be
given away each year comfortably exceeds the combined annual grants of the
Arts Councils of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a
gormless arts organisation, professional or amateur, that is not considering
a pitch. Crafts people, and film and video makers, as long as they combine
into a group, can also apply.
The Arts Council has interpreted the original government directives as
loosely as possible to make things easier for companies. There is still an
element of matching funding, but nowhere near the original 50/50. An arts
company seeking Pounds 100,000 or more from the lottery must raise a quarter
of the sum requested through its own efforts - from friends, from business,
from fund raising events, from local authorities. Anyone seeking less than
Pounds 100,000 need only find 10 per cent, and for very small companies the
council hopes to be even more reasonable.
No one knows how many applications there will be, with estimates ranging
from 10,000 to 30,000. Up to three quarters are expected to be for sums of
less than Pounds 100,000. To begin with the money is likely to be given to
existing small and medium sized arts companies, with good track records and
obvious expansion needs. Once these easy options have been taken care of the
Arts Council will turn its attention to the delicate matter of new, mainly
amateur, arts companies, and the big boys.
Jeremy Newton does not expect to hand out more than Pounds 10m on any one
project. But the Royal Opera House, which is seeking around Pounds 50m from
the lottery for its rebuilding programme, need not be too down-hearted. The
council could give Pounds 10m for the first phase of a development and
another Pounds 10m for a second.
There is also an acceptance that the really major claimants, those seeking
Pounds 40m plus, like the South Bank Centre, the British Museum, the new
Tate Gallery of Modern Art, Cardiff Bay Opera House, etc, can apply to more
than one lottery source, in particular the Heritage Lottery Fund and the
Millennium Fund. Personnel will be in place to handle joint, or manifold,
applications.
The council has also moved slightly over the vexed matter of what the money
can be used for - but only slightly. It is basically to go on capital
projects - on converting a disused church, or an empty cinema, into a
theatre or community arts centre etc. Wisely, it is reluctant to attract the
government's wrath by giving lottery cash to clear overdrafts. Perhaps for
brand new ventures there might be a small revenue endowment to tide an
organisation over before it starts to earn cash.
But it would be madness to blur the issue: annual funding must remain the
responsibility of the Arts Council, paid for by its grant from the
government. If it started to help out the current plight of clients with
lottery cash the government would quickly seize the opportunity to cut the
annual subsidy. And any arts organisation getting lottery money to improve
its facilities should soon benefit in revenue terms by attracting larger
audiences.
The annual council grant is in enough danger as it is. The cabinet met on
Tuesday to decide budgets for 1995-96. Last year the English Arts Council
had its grant cut by for the first time, by Pounds 3.2m, and it has been
promised an increase of only Pounds 900,000, to Pounds 186m, for next year.
It is campaigning for the restoration of the Pounds 3.2m, plus an inflation
increase.
The reputation of the new heritage secretary, Stephen Dorrell, will rest on
his success in bringing home the bacon. To date he has kept a low profile.
The rising groundswell about this aloofness will disappear if he can achieve
more money for his department on budget day - and give some of it to the
arts. There is a real danger that the government thinks it has pacified the
arts world with the lottery: but there is little point in promising cake
tomorrow if some arts organisations have starved to death in the meantime.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Aston Martin back on the right road - Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aston Martin started to lose its way as a small-scale, high-performance
car-maker 20 years ago, Now, however, it is back on track.
It took the wrong turning early in the 1970s by replacing the DB6s with
massive, V8-engined cars which, progressively, became more obese,
over-powered and over-priced. While rich owners could enjoy playing with
these Pounds 100,000-plus toys on racing circuits hired for the occasion,
their bulk and thirst made them less pleasant and practical as normal road
cars.
With the introduction of the new DB7, however, everything has changed. Aston
Martin is making a great car again - and we have Ford to thank. Its input
into the DB7 included a vastly more extensive development programme than the
British company could ever have afforded in the old days. It promises to be
the most reliable Aston Martin for years.
By Aston standards, the price of Pounds 78,500 is down to earth - the V8s
start at Pounds 133,574. But the DB7 is incomparably more pleasant to drive.
Its 3.2-litre straight six has a dual personality. It develops 335
horsepower at 5,500rpm, sounding just a shade metallic as the revolutions
rise, but delivers maximum torque (that is, pulls hardest) at only 3,000rpm.
The supercharger boost is felt from 1,000rpm upwards, which represents 30mph
(50kph) in fifth gear.
Once clear of town traffic, a lazy driver could exploit this silken surge of
power and treat the DB7 almost as a one-gear car. Most, of course, will
prefer to let the engine spin fast through the gears and experience the
lightning acceleration - 0-62mph (100kmh) in just 5.7 seconds - even though
they will have to trust the maker's claim of a 165mph (266kph) maximum.
The five-speed gearbox is not as good as those of the best German and
Japanese cars - my test car's transmission made sizzling noises when cold
and felt a bit slack at times. A 4-speed automatic with electronic control
is available and a limited slip differential that helps stifle wheelspin is
standard.
And although the DB7 has ultra-low-profile Bridgestone tyres only 40 per
cent as high in cross-section as they are wide, its ride is astonishing.
Subtle power assistance takes all the effort out of low-speed steering but
removes none of the open road feel.
Styling is an individual matter but, by common consent, the DB7 looks
sensational. There is a hint of the old DB6 around its haunches and the
Aston Martin badge sits easily on the down-swept nose.
Inside, it is traditionally British, with soft leather seats that support in
all the right places and touches of wood veneer on the fascia.
Air-conditioning, cruise control and all-disc, anti-lock brakes are
standard. But air-bags are not available until early next year.
At the most, only 650 DB7s will be built in the next 12 months - and half of
those have been spoken for, with Pounds 10,000 deposits paid up front. Sales
will start in the US in the spring of 1996.
A DB7 Volante cabriolet is coming and may be joined later by a V12.
If a car with the Aston's price is just a dream, consider the DB7's distant
relative, the Ford Probe. Based on a Mazda (Ford also owns a chunk of the
Japanese company), this US-made 2+2 comes in two versions: a 2.5-litre V6 at
Pounds 20,160; and a two-litre, four-cylinder version, equipped less
elaborately, at Pounds 16,745.
I drove a two-litre Probe at the end of a memorable day at the wheel of a
DB7. Never mind that the Probe is little more than one-fifth the Aston
Martin's price. It is quite sleek and still unusual enough to make heads
turn.
A tortoise to the Aston Martin's hare? I suppose so but, in the real world,
its usable performance is little different.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: King of the cowboys - Nigel Andrews talks to veteran
western movie-maker and former matador Bud Boetticher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tall, rugged, silver-haired man with the husky-rich voice says: 'A man
had a job to do and he went out and did it.' What is he talking about?
Plumbers? Encyclopaedia salesmen? No. This man is in California, surrounded
by hills and horses; so he must be a veteran movie-maker talking about
Westerns.
Budd Boetticher is 78 years old and made a stream of acclaimed and
characterful cowboy films in the 1950s, shot for peanuts (Dollars
400,000-odd apiece) and starring Randolph Scott. Taut tales of honour and
vengeance - 'morality plays' Boetticher rightly calls them - the films
became a cult: first in France, where critic Andre Bazin idolised and
explicated them, later in Britain and America.
This weekend Boetticher - pronounced Bettiker - gets the full hoopla as a
guest lecturer at the London Film Festival. The LFF also revives his best
Western The Tall T.
I had thought this B-movie legend dead until I picked up a copy of Variety
in Hollywood. There I read that he was limbering up for a new movie project:
a Spain-made, Robert Mitchum-starring Western that begins shooting next
year. I drove 150 miles to meet him at a stable/bullring complex in the
majestic hills north-east of San Diego.
Here Boetticher, after proudly introducing me to his Lippizaner horses,
showed me the arena where he still puts in matador practice. For the
Chicago-born lad began as a bullfighter in Mexico. Then he muscled into
Columbia mogul Harry Cohn's office to wrangle a job as technical adviser on
the bullfighting film Blood And Sand (1941). Then after shinning up the
ladder from messenger boy to assistant director, he began making his own
films: including two up-budget tauromachy epics The Bullfighter And The Lady
(1950) and The Magnificent Matador (1955).
But it was the Scott Westerns, made between 1956 and 1960, that had
Boetticher's special stamp. Realism and raw authority. 'A masterly observer
of primitive man,' David Thomson calls him in his touchstone reference work
A Biographical Dictionary of the Cinema, and talks of the films' 'consistent
and bleak preoccupation with life and death, sun and shade.'
What else, you may ask, would a film-maker be preoccupied with when stuck in
the desert with scant funds and a scary eighteen-day schedule?
But that is exactly what made those rough-and-ready 1950s westerns -
Boetticher's were rivalled only by the best of Anthony Mann (Winchester 73)
and Delmer Daves (Drum Beat) - so crucial a piece in the mosaic of the
genre's history.
Beyond the studio's long reach film-makers could go for all the bleakness
and existentialism they wanted. And they could begin the subtle, radical
process of equalising the genre's moral-dramatic balance between heroes and
villains: even if that meant hoodwinking head office.
'On Ride Lonesome we didn't want to kill the villains, we wanted to let them
escape. The studio said I couldn't. So I argued for shooting it both ways .
. . Well, we shot my version in which the villains escape; but when the time
came to shoot the version in which they're killed, the trucks were in the
way of the setting sun and we couldn't do it. So we went back with just my
scene.'
Boetticher always wanted his villains to survive. He also wanted them to be
as appealing and charismatic as his hero. 'Our baddies could've been
sheriffs,' says the director, listing the future stars who started as
Boetticher villains: Lee Marvin, Richard Boone, James Coburn . . .The idea
is that the audience would like them and root for them; that they'd question
the boundaries between good actions and bad. And we'd expand the bad guys'
roles . . . The idea is that the villains should be cuter than the hero.'
Cuter? Well, Boetticher's carefree attitude to the dodgier implications of
B-movie buddyism may account for his work's charm and power. At one and the
same time it seems both straight-arrow and rich with ambivalences.
Boetticher never laboured the latter; they seem to grow straight up from the
landscape.
'The big problem with the Western,' he says when I ask why the genre began
to die after the 1950s, 'is that all these Easterners who never saw a horse
starting making 'psychological' Westerns. And they confused even themselves.
My characters weren't smart enough to have a psychological problem.'
After Boetticher's 1950s heyday he made one praised gangster film, The Rise
And The Fall Of Legs Diamond, and then acted out his own fall during seven
nightmare years in Mexico.
Shooting a film about his friend the bullfighter Carlos Arruza, he ran out
of money, got divorced, was thrown in jail, spent a week in a mental asylum.
Then he nearly died, first of malnutrition, later of a lung ailment.
Meanwhile Arruza himself was killed in a car accident along with most of the
film's crew.
But back in Hollywood Boetticher picked himself up. He sold the odd script:
notably Two Mules For Sister Sara for Clint Eastwood. And he entered the
decades of European adoration. Why does he think he has become a cult?
'Because I tell the truth. If there's something phoney about me or my life,
I don't know what it is. And if I found out I'd rectify it. I think that
comes across in the films.'
It does. But judge for yourselves. The Tall T is on at the National Film
Theatre tomorrow. Boetticher talks at 2 pm. And his new film, A Horse For Mr
Barnum, should be out next year.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Headlights shine on midnight run - FT Ski
Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. They are now in the US on the last stage of their
odyssey.
It was snowing quite hard outside and the last thing we wanted to do after
an excellent dinner in Mammoth Lakes was to go skiing. But after a week on
Mammoth Mountain's slopes we had a flight to catch.
We were on our way to an unscheduled return to Summit County, Colorado,
where Keystone shared with Mammoth the distinction of being the only resort
we could find in the US with lifts operating.
This meant a five-hour drive through the desert to Los Angeles the next
morning - and to get in our skiing for the day, we had either to ski after
midnight or at 5am.
In the event, it was exhilarating. Although the great, brooding mountain was
in darkness, it certainly was not quiet. Teams of snow-makers were busy
monitoring the snow-guns blasting three trails - Fascination, Broadway and
Far West - with a fresh carpet of instant snow.
Tim Russell and Eric Gehrung, complete with snowmobiles and miners-style
helmets equipped with lamps, met us at the bottom of the slopes. 'Why don't
you ski during the day?' asked Russell, genuinely confused by our desire to
ski at 1am. We explained. Then, each of us hanging on to a snowmobile, Lucy
and I were zooming up to the top of Lift 1. Our two drivers followed us
down, their headlights sending our shadows across Broadway as we made fresh
tracks in the night's new snow.
It was just as well we skied at night: at dawn we headed for the airport in
a blizzard.
It was not to be our day. Gremlins in the system meant that authorisation by
American Airlines, our sponsors, of our flight from Los Angeles to Denver
did not show on the computers in Los Angeles. In the confusion we managed to
upset another sponsor, Avis, by having to leave our vehicle outside the
departure lounge.
When we finally reached Denver, we thought we were in good hands: Ski The
Summit - our main sponsors - had booked a room for us at Stouffer's hotel.
More gremlins. The hotel had no record of our booking. By this time - 2,214
miles and 17 hours after leaving Mammoth  - the weary FT skiers were
beginning to experience symptoms of paranoia.
But tomorrow was another ski day. To our delight, although Copper Mountain
was not yet officially open, we were invited to join race teams hurtling
down Main Vein, a vertical drop of 1,425ft served by Copper's American Eagle
high-speed quad lift.
Inspired by our fellow skiers, we skied almost 25,000 vertical feet in three
hours.
During one descent, a skier flashed past. We were sharing the run with
Olympic downhill silver medallist Picabo Street. Suddenly, our rate of
descent seemed snail-like.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Cutting rivals down to size - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Aspen leaves have been sent swirling into creeks and ditches by the
first real storms of November. Another winter has begun in the Rockies. And
with it comes the outbreak of ski wars - or possibly unlikely alliances.
The US may have about 14m skiers, but since 1977 it has lost an estimated
413 ski areas. Although these were mainly small resorts with insufficient
profit margins, no one is taking any chances. The American ski magazines
give a taste of the cut and thrust.
'The folks up in Vail, the biggest of Colorado's mega-resorts, like to boast
that their mountain can accommodate 41,200 skiers per hour. But who wants to
ski with 41,199 other people?' This was an advertisement in the November
issue of Snow Country magazine placed by Vail's rival, Crested Butte.
Quoting America's National Ski Areas Association, Snow Country claims that
one-third of the nation's ski areas can 'barely keep their heads above the
snow financially'.
Only those attracting more than 200,000 skier visits a season make
sufficient profit - Dollars 11.47 per visit - to be able to purchase new
lifts, lodges, grooming machines and afford to pay taxes, debt interest and
some return to investors.
Any opportunity to cut a ski area down to size is seized: 'For as long as
anyone can remember, Aspen Highlands has claimed 3,800 vertical feet.
Colorado's biggest vertical. But when the mountain was resurveyed for the
installation of two new high-speed quad chairs, it turned out to be only
3,635ft.
'So, did the mountain shrink? According to an Aspen Highlands' official, the
ski area's original developer (and measurer) was 'very optimistic'.' This is
from November's Skiing Magazine.
Aspen recently purchased Highlands and has been modernising its antiquated
lift system. The maverick ski area had been a small but irritating thorn in
its side for decades. It was Aspen which helped start the 'if you can't beat
them join them' revolution as an alternative to ski wars.
In recent seasons Vail, a far more deadly rival than Aspen Highlands ever
was, has been marketing itself with Aspen as a twin-centre ski holiday - an
unthinkable arrangement a decade ago.
Now, even Jackson Hole - another Rockies giant, which has signed up Tommy
Moe, the Olympic Downhill gold medallist as its 'ski ambassador' - is busy
promoting two minor competitors: Grand Targhee (a powder trap across the
Tetons) and Snow King, a small but steep resort in the town of Jackson. The
new Jackson Hole 'multi area lift ticket' will be valid this winter at all
three resorts.
Resorts such as Crested Butte, however, seem determined to continue their
David and Goliath campaigns. This advertisement is from Ski, another
American ski magazine: 'The glitz and glamour of Aspen is only 20 miles away
from Crested Butte. Fortunately there's a 14,000ft mountain range between
us.'
Crested Butte, alone among resorts in the Rockies, is offering free skiing
before Christmas for the fourth year running. But this year the offer starts
later than usual, on November 28 rather than at Thanksgiving. 'With 9,300
young people testing our mountain at Thanksgiving, we definitely had
concerns about the impact on our towns, parking facilities, mountain
operations and residents,' says Steve Scott, a senior vice president.
In the event, Mammoth Mountain in California's Eastern Sierras unexpectedly
fired the most effective opening salvo of the winter: the resort opened
three trails, Broadway, Fascination and Far West on October 8 (with free
skiing for the day), its earliest opening in history, robbing Killington,
Vermont and Keystone, Colorado - who traditionally battle to be the first US
ski resort to open - of their usual kudos.
Killington opened and closed because it became too warm to make snow, and
Keystone quickly regained the initiative by opening two quad lifts serving
2,200 vertical feet of excellent man-made snow.
Neighbouring Copper Mountain's American Eagle lift opened early to allow
members of the American ski team to get some pre-season training on Main
Vein, a fast cruising run with a 1,420ft vertical drop.
But however well organised and marketed the resort, and however superbly
groomed the slopes and the lift queues, mountain food remains an issue in
the US. Perhaps the Americans are finally realising that this is the one
realm in which the European resorts knock spots off them.
Although many American skiers are preoccupied with how much their precious
lift-tickets have cost and often want nothing more than fast-food before
resuming their attack on the slopes, others are envious of the Alpine
institution of lunch and would appreciate something more than just a swift
hamburger and a beer. Some ski resorts are now building a new generation of
sophisticated mountain restaurants to cater for them.
Sun Valley, Idaho, has opened Seattle Ridge Lodge, a vast, spacious and
plushly carpeted restaurant run by a French Maitre d'. At Blackcomb in
British Columbia, a 'fine dining' establishment has opened on the slopes at
Glacier Creek. Both offer a wide variety of international cuisine.
Keystone, Colorado, has something even more special: the Alpenglow Stube,
which somehow manages to dish up splendid fare at 11,444ft. Your ski boots
are deposited in a warming room and substituted by a pair of soft
moccasin-style slippers supplied by the management.
Once you have sat down to a luxurious four or five course meal served with
fine wine, you can forget about doing any more skiing, at least in daylight.
But one of the compensations for giving up half a day of much-needed
exercise in the quest for sinful pleasures is that Keystone has outstanding
night skiing with perhaps the most extensive floodlit terrain in the world.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Sport: Nice teeth, but who was his sire? - Equestrianism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Auctioneer Nick Nugent was struggling. He is one of Ireland's finest men
with a gavel, but it needed all his blarney and bluster to coax bids from
the packed stands at the High Performance Horse Sales in Warwickshire last
week.
'It's a market in which English buyers are going to need educating,' said
Nugent, patiently in the circumstances.
John Studd, a London chartered surveyor whose hobby is owning and breeding
competition horses, sat anxiously awaiting the arrival of Lot 10. His
five-year-old chestnut gelding Gunner Killinghurst should make a top
three-day-event horse. Normally such an animal would be sold by
word-of-mouth, 'out of the field' as horse-folk put it.
However, Studd is not alone in believing that times must change. He wants a
Continental-style breeding system with full information on the pedigree of
every horse which would be sold, vetted and warranted, at a prestigious
sale.
'Look at the Verdun auction sale where horses for show-jumping and eventing
routinely make Pounds 40,000-Pounds 100,000. There's no private market for
these types of animals in Germany,' he said.
Studd hoped that Gunner Killinghurst would make Pounds 5,500.
The first of the British HPH sales was in 1987. Its aim was to put more
science, method and cash into an area of equestrian sport in which the UK
had excelled by using traditional methods.
So long as the horses won, whether at Olympia or the Olympics, it mattered
not whether they were bred and bought in the gloom of a black art. However,
as the sports of showjumping, eventing and dressage became more popular in
continental Europe, British ways, and the performance of the animals, began
to fall out of step with the Continent.
Newcomers to the equestrian world also demand a marketplace, where even if
they lacked the 'eye for a horse', they could still buy with confidence.
Blackpool solicitor Anthony Slater was at the HPH sale to buy a horse for
his daughter Jane, 22, about to take up eventing.
'I've never bought at an auction before and I'm finding it a nerve-wracking
experience,' he confessed. Slater successfully bid to 9,000 guineas for the
five-year-old bay gelding Ben Fox. He was impressed at the chance to inspect
the horses over a period of days and compare animals of similar age. Slater,
a novice purchaser, felt the sale organisers were reassuringly honest about
faults in a young horse. Yet the clincher was probably the clear lineage
behind Ben Fox.
Prominent in the foyer at the HPH sale were the trailblazers of the British
Horse Database. This was set up a year ago, largely on a Pounds 250,00 grant
from the Worshipful Company of Saddlers, to tackle the problem that most
British horses just have no paperwork to prove their identity or parentage.
The phenomenon stretches top to bottom. In 1992, Mary Thomson won Badminton
on King William, a horse that represented Britain at the Olympics the same
year. The gelding is an orphan child. No one, least of all Thomson, who
bought him on a hunch in a farmyard, has a clue about William's breeding.
His mare and sire could by now have produced a string of top eventers, with
attendant sporting and financial benefits, if there were any breeding
records.
Of course, breed groups, most notably the Hunter Improvement Society, do
keep careful records. Yet they are hard for a non-member to use. The BHD has
plans for modem access into its database (as happens in the French
equestrian industry via Minitel) and, equally importantly, will monitor how
horses perform in competition.
'At the moment, by the time the results are collated and a stallion is
identified as a good competition sire he's either quite elderly or dead,'
said Flora McDowall, development controller with the BHD.
Yet for all the good intentions there are still only 6,000 animals on the
database. In a rational world the HPH sale would be where the future winners
of Burghley, Olympia and the Olympics were to be bought. And the Thomsons,
Whitakers and Todds would be in the audience buying for the late 1990s. But
at Stoneleigh, neither the horses nor the buyers had star quality,
suggesting that the top animals are still being sold quietly in a field
somewhere, for a fraction of their potential value.
More than half the horses presented at the HPH sale failed to make their
reserve and were withdrawn. The top price was just over 12,000 guineas, an
opening bid at Verdun. And Studd? Gunner Killinghurst took all Nick Nugent's
skill but he finally sold at 4,300 guineas. 'We're going the right way but
it will take time,' sighed the owner.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Sport: The dark world of bribes and bungs - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The video of a man alleged to be Bruce Grobbelaar, the Southampton and
former Liverpool goalkeeper, apparently negotiating to throw a match, made
distressing viewing for any fan of English soccer. His laugh when he boasted
of deliberately letting in a goal was like a kick in the stomach. Suddenly
the replay of Andy Cole's hat-trick against Grobbelaar when Newcastle beat
Liverpool last November, looks less like the coming of age of a young
striker. Instead the eye is caught by Grobbelaar's vain acrobatics as one
wonders if he is in the best position, is he reacting fast enough? The
accusations have led to careful scrutiny of his play.
Grobbelaar denies that he has ever taken bribes or that he has ever tried to
fix the result of any game.
There have been match-fixing scandals in the far east and in eastern Europe,
but rarely in the UK.
There have been odd incidents of match-rigging in England, however. Three
Sheffield Wednesday players were jailed for betting on their team to lose at
Ipswich in 1962. And opponents of Leeds United in the 1970s claimed they
rejected bribes to lose matches.
Accepting bribes would represent a high risk for a relatively low return for
the average English Premier League player, judging by the amounts Grobbelaar
is said to have negotiated: from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 150,000. Few earn
less than Pounds 5,000 a week plus bonuses, although Grobbelaar is said to
have earned much less at Liverpool. He is accused of having tried to deliver
an agreed score in at least four matches. If so he succeeded in only one,
Newcastle's 3-0 win over Liverpool. Even here Liverpool nearly scored to
spoil the 'sting' in the last minutes.
To guarantee a result a large number of players and go-betweens need to be
involved - in the 1983 Hungarian match-fixing conspiracy 260 players and 14
referees were suspended and 75 people convicted of criminal offences - and
that increases the risk of a leak.
A player who accepts a bribe risks life suspension, public humiliation and
perhaps jail. There are safer traditional fiddles in British soccer. These
have a long and vigorous tradition and are seen by those in soccer as
victimless crimes; no one counts the tax inspector. Since within the game
there are few losers, there is little reason to break ranks.
However, fans can suffer when their teams buy or sell players. Sometimes,
managers receive a cut of the fee - several have clauses in their contracts
giving them a percentage of profits they make dealing in players. Sometimes
a player who is unfit or out of form is picked because he, or the manager,
wants to safeguard his transfer value. Occasionally a player who wants a
transfer plays badly.
The FT spoke to two soccer insiders. One is the former chairman of a lower
division club - referred to as the Director - the other was an administrator
of a Premier League club, the Administrator.
BONUSES Since attendances are related to league position and cup runs it
makes sense to tie expenditure to revenue through incentives. But some
managers do not like them. In any case they must be carefully thought out.
One chairman of a lower-division club introduced special bonuses for a
popular striker: Pounds 50 for each goal with an extra bonus for a
hat-trick. The striker would share his bonuses with the rest of the team.
The consequence, says the Director, was that the other players started
passing to the striker even if they were in better scoring positions. He
says he once saw a player on a breakaway stop and wait for the star to catch
up, passing up a certain goal in the hope of his share of a hat-trick bonus.
HOLIDAYS Holidays are normally taxable perks, but not for leading football
clubs which find two-week post-season trips to some sunny resort essential
for team-building. Wives and mistresses come too, but often only for one
week. Wives come out for the first week, mistresses for the second. Clubs
discovered that if they organised things the other way round careless gossip
from hotel staff could alert wives to the existence of mistresses and that
does not help build team spirit.
CASH Anyone who has covered non-league soccer, where clubs often make most
of their money at the bar, has seen soccer's cash economy at work. The
manager and the players come into the clubhouse after the game. The manager
walks over to the bar and the players crowd round him, but instead of
reaching into the pocket of his sheepskin coat the boss sticks out his hand.
The barman hands over a wad of notes and the manager doles these out to the
players.
Turnstile fiddles used to be a soccer commonplace. Clubs would turn off the
meters at 3pm, or slightly before, and anyone who came in after that was not
counted in the attendance. Clubs would often allow managers or star players
to put one of their men on a turnstile and keep the takings, or even keep a
percentage of the takings of one stand. When big clubs deigned to go to
little clubs for friendlies, the visiting manager would often expect a
similar arrangement.
But the days when club secretaries spent Saturday afternoon in tiny rooms
under the main stand counting mountains of small coins and sorting out
players' boot money are gone. A high proportion of tickets are paid for with
cheques or credit cards. Furthermore, in the aftermath of the Bradford fire
and the Hillsborough disaster, clubs can no longer lie about attendances.
It is much easier to calculate the gate at an all-seater stadium. Safety
inspectors and local authority licensing officials lurk at every game, and
any turnstile may come under their scrutiny. In any case a growing number of
clubs have computerised turnstiles which allow safety officers to keep an
exact track on how many fans there are in each part of the ground. If a club
needs cash for a bung it will often come from the chairman's pocket or from
one of his other businesses.
THE BUNG In the safety of the High Court last year Alan Sugar, Tottenham
Hotspur chairman, said Brian Clough, then manager of Nottingham Forest,
'liked a bung': cash to arrange the transfer of players from Forest. Clough
denied the accusation.
But while bungs for managers are not uncommon, agents benefit most often.
Most top players have agents or commercial representatives.
A well-organised manager who wants to re-sign a player will often take the
precaution of reaching a quiet agreement with the agent before starting
negotiations with the player. The agent may well find he is well compensated
for the commission he loses by persuading the player to accept too low a
contract. Where a player is coveted by more than one club, an agent will
find his good will in demand. Such payments are usually made in cash,
although the agent may find his reward wrapped up in payments for other
services.
LOYALTY BONUSES When a player signs a new contract he will receive a signing
on fee, which can be quite large. In each year of the contract, on the
anniversary of its signing, he will receive a loyalty bonus. The loyalty
bonuses and signing on fee together can add as much as 50 per cent to the
total value of the contract. If a player asks for a transfer in writing he
will lose the next loyalty bonus. So players must master the trick of
forcing clubs to sell them without making a written request.
Furthermore, if a player is transferred part of the way through the year
there can often be some debate as to whether he is entitled to the loyalty
bonus. Often, especially where a player is being unloaded to a less wealthy
club, the selling club will pay the loyalty bonus to encourage the player to
leave and take his lucrative contract with him.
CONTRACTS Contracts are worth rather less than the average fan might think.
For a rising star reaching the end of his contract and keen to move to a
bigger club the best policy may be re-sign with his current club. He need
not surrender the freedom that being out of contract brings if he makes an
oral deal with the club that it will sell him if a big team bids for him.
The player lands two signing-on bonuses and the club receives a much larger
transfer fee than it would have done if he were out of contract. If the club
tries to renege on the deal, the star can stop playing well, driving down
his transfer value and weakening the team. The threat is usually enough, but
it does happen.
VAT Football clubs live in terror of the Vat inspector. But the Vat
inspector can be a friend of the indebted club because he is a patient
creditor. The Director found it could be in the interests of a club to have
the Vat inspector slap a distraint order on a club which effectively locks
up its assets. Since the club must pay Vat before any other creditor, the
effect was to persuade the others to stop clamouring for their cash, knowing
that if they forced the club to the wall they would collect nothing.
THE PLAYER POOL At many clubs there are two player pools in which money is
collected for players. There is the one that exists and the one that does
not. The one that exists is the one the manager refers to when he talks of
players being fined for being booked or some misdemeanour at training: being
late, swearing, forgetting some of his kit. Usually these fines, even for
bookings in a match, are small: Pounds 10 or Pounds 5 a time. But by the end
of the season the average squad of professional footballers will have
committed enough offences to pay for a good night out.
The player pool that does not exist is the one that is filled with payments
for unofficial work. Players generally hate meeting the public. Fans like
meeting players. Often, wealthy and corporate fans or sponsors who own boxes
at football grounds will pay players to come up and meet their guests before
or after the match. These payments can run to several hundreds of pounds for
a session of glad-handing. A solitary star may pocket the cash, but often
groups of players go along together or perhaps the players take turns, and
the money goes into a quite substantial pool of untaxed cash, which, of
course, does not exist.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Property: Spruce up, oaks down - Gerald Cadogan on the new
woodland grant regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a big disappointment that the new grant regulations for woods tilt
away from broadleaf (deciduous) trees to conifers. Pinewoods are a
depressing shroud on the landscape.
The rules have been in effect since September but the industry is still
trying to work out how they will be interpreted. Meanwhile, the Forestry
Commission, which closed the old schemes in July, is running courses to
expound its 'reforms'.
Two parallel schemes, the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland
Premium Scheme, offer similar planting grants. Rates for conifers are a flat
Pounds 700 a hectare; previously they were Pounds 615 for over 10 hectares
and from Pounds 795 to Pounds 1,005 for up to 10 hectares.
The new broadleaf rate is Pounds 1,350 (formerly Pounds 1,175-Pounds 1,575)
for up to 10 hectares and Pounds 1,050 (Pounds 975) for more than 10
hectares. A 14 per cent grant increase for conifers and an 8 per cent rise
for larger areas of broadleaves are the result.
It will now be considerably more expensive for a farmer to plant across a
corner of a field to make an easier sweep for the tractor as the grants for
small plantations have been cut. Sadly, the many small new farm copses,
usually of broadleaves, which are a direct result of the old scheme and are
fast improving the look of the land, will dry up.
Re-stocking grants are also down sharply, to a flat Pounds 325 (conifers)
and Pounds 525 (broadleaves). This will channel the commission's funds
towards new planting - on the implicit assumption that the owner who is
re-stocking has cash in the bank already.
The standard management grant has been scrapped but the old special
management grant stays. Now called the annual management grant and worth
Pounds 35 a hectare from the time of planting, it will have strict and
targeted criteria such as public access or, thank goodness, a specified
proportion of broadleaves.
Another constraint is that all planting must now be at 2,250 trees a hectare
(except for amenity woodlands under three hectares); the previous volume for
broadleaves was 1,100 trees. This applies even to better farmland, which
qualifies for a supplement of Pounds 600 a hectare (formerly Pounds 400 for
conifers and Pounds 600 for broadleaves).
The combined grant and supplement for conifers is now 28 per cent higher
than before, while the demand for much closer planting of broadleaves means
that an owner must buy many more young trees to plant. It is bound to lead
to more conifers such as spruce being planted - and fewer oaks, ash and
beech.
Barry Gamble, managing director of Fountain Forestry, says: 'I think it is a
straightforward commercial decision if grants are going to be sustainable in
the long haul. The commission's resources are limited.'
In the UK, the woodland market has been busier this year than last although
property prices have not gone up - or not yet. But Gamble says the recent
rise in timber prices of 10-20 per cent must be an excellent leading
indicator that now is a fine time to buy a wood.
US prices have done better still. They are up about 50 per cent - more for
hardwoods - as supply scrambles to catch up with demand. 'Black cherry and
oak are still rising there,' says Gamble. When the recession began, US
producers and users de-stocked. But with the upturn of the economy, supply
is short and prices have risen.
Back in Britain, meanwhile, as the plague of conifers spreads, the copses
planted under the old system will be ever more welcome.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Property: Ripple becomes a wider stream - London recovery
spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The little ripple that started running through the central London property
market two years ago has now spread.
The small upturn started after the devaluation of sterling in September 1992
made the prime areas of central London attractive to buyers from the Far
East. The knock-on has now reached to areas of central-outer London where UK
buyers predominate, either established Londoners moving house or the young
starting their careers.
Which parts of town are on the up? Agent Winkworth, which gets a good
picture from 31 franchised offices across the capital, suggests familiar
names such as Notting Hill and Islington - and surprises such as Acton and
Victoria Park, in the depressed East End district of Hackney.
The buyers divide into two types: those seeking a single, or main, residence
and those who have a larger place elsewhere and are after a pied-a-terre in
town.
In Bloomsbury, famed for writer Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Set, the
pied-a-terre brigade makes up 80 per cent of buyers, says David Salvi of
Barnard Marcus. They are mostly lawyers, doctors, and people in publishing
and the media.
It is much the same in nearby Covent Garden, says Lesa Green, of EA Shaw.
'They want a simple pad. It does not matter if it is over a shop or
restaurant.'
One of the tricks is to work out which areas are about to become fashionable
and buy before the stampede drives prices up. In the west London district of
Notting Hill, the herd is gathering already, although prices are cheap only
by comparison with similar accommodation in Chelsea, Knightsbridge,
Kensington and Holland Park - the areas where the ripple began.
Communal gardens, a feature of the area, are a great advantage. A large
Notting Hill maisonette opening on to one costs Pounds 450,000 to Pounds
500,000 and will attract younger buyers away from two-bedroom flats in
Chelsea and Knightsbridge. And there are large family houses at about Pounds
2m, against Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7m for similar town mansions in Holland
Park.
In some cases, prices in the area have risen sometimes by as much as 20 per
cent this year, says Giles Hoskins, of Winkworth in Notting Hill - and 90
per cent of the buyers are British.
This demand has spread northwards to W10 where the Queen's Park estate
(originally the Shaftesbury estate) north of the Harrow Road is popular.
Terrace houses with two or three bedrooms, costing Pounds 75,000 to Pounds
100,000, go quickly to young professional couples or singles.
The latter are often first-time buyers who continued renting through the
recession. Now, they have enough money to jump the usual first step in the
housing ladder - a studio flat - in favour of something more substantial.
Further west, Acton W3 takes over-spill from Chiswick and Hammersmith.
Prices range from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 155,000 for a house near Acton
Town (District and Piccadilly Underground lines) in the triangle of roads
formed by The Ridgeway, Park Drive and Princes Avenue.
Those prices are 10 to 15 per cent lower than they would be in neighbouring
Chiswick, and Winkworth has sold 17 houses in this triangle in the past
year. The alternative is the 'poets' corner' near Acton Central (North
London line) where the roads are named after Cowper, Milton and others.
Further north and east, Islington offers fine Georgian and early-Victorian
houses, theatres, restaurants and good public transport. For real value,
though, Winkworth's Andrew Towler advises buyers to go half a mile east to
the De Beauvoir estate.
This has excellent Victorian houses interspersed with council homes. A
three-bedroom property there would cost Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 160,000,
compared with Pounds 250,000 near the Angel in the heart of Islington.
Still further east, City people are discovering Victoria Park, E9, where
four-bedroom houses cost from Pounds 120,000 to Pounds 250,000 and it is
easy to reach the City and the West End by bus or Underground (District and
Central lines).
At Clapham South SW4, (Northern line), four estate agents have opened
recently to cover the streets off Abbeville Road, near the south-east corner
of Clapham Common. A five-bedroom house in Elms Road with conservatory, roof
terrace and garden is available from Winkworth for Pounds 365,000.
But go a mile south-east, to Streatham SW2, and you will find splendid value
in five streets around the area of Telford Avenue. The houses are
substantial and mostly red-brick late Victorian and Edwardian, with five to
eight bedrooms and costing around Pounds 250,000.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Gardening: Late Treacle, the last perry - Clive Fewins meets
Charles Martell who collects the largest of fruit trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There's a cowslip,' the old man said. 'Where?' said Charles Martell, looking
at the ground. 'No, you fool, the tree]' the old man said.
Six weeks later the old man died, but he had helped Martell save yet another
rare variety of perry pear tree.
The incident happened two years ago. Cowslip is one of 50 varieties of perry
pear identified in the mid-1950s. Martell has found specimens of 49, all of
which he has recorded in full and propagated.
Martell, a farmer and cheesemaker, is a champion of Gloucestershire's
agricultural history - in particular perry, which is to pears what cider is
to apples. At his 55-acre farm near the Gloucestershire village of Dymock he
has investigated the 50 additional varieties of perry pear known by name,
and thinks he has also discovered a handful more.
At this time of year as the apple and pear harvest gets into full swing,
Martell keeps a keen eye open for the 'missing' variety: Late Treacle.
'Friends pull my leg and say the clue lies in the long-lost Dymock treacle
mines. Wherever it is I shall find it eventually,' said Martell, 48.
He found the other 49 varieties by walking, cycling and driving round the
three counties of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire for
seven years. Every time he finds a new specimen he takes a cutting, then
grafts it on to a root stock before planting either in one of his orchards
or at a plot he has been given at the Three Counties Showground at Malvern.
There, Martell's efforts will remain for posterity: the grandly-named infant
National Collection of Perry Pears. They are there for all to see as a
result of the pioneering identification work nearly 40 years ago of Ray
Williams, formerly of the long Ashton Research Station near Bristol.
They are infant trees because perry pears are 'the giants of the forest'
among fruit trees. Stinking Bishop - one of the largest varieties of perry
pear - will reach a height of 70ft and take 25 years to mature, before
producing more than a ton of fruit each in a good season. At nearby Much
Marcle, home of Westons, the region's biggest manufacturer of perry, there
are some perry pears still cropping that were planted to commemorate the
accession of Queen Anne in 1702.
Other varieties bear such colourful names as Merrylegs, Painted Lady,
Hedgehog, Hendry Huffcap, Bloody Bastard, Steel yer Balls, Ramscod, Clipper
Dick and Dead Boy.
'Perry pears really are monsters compared to other fruit trees, which is why
it is quite easy to identify them,' Martell said. 'Many of the small farms
in the three counties have a handful of perry pears that would produce perry
for the family and the farm workers for a whole season.'
Once he has managed to plant all 50 varieties identified by Williams, who
travels up from his retirement home near Bristol whenever Martell thinks he
has a found a lost variety, the next stage is to encourage more local
farmers to make perry again. 'You will find stone cider and perry mills -
round troughs in which the apples were crushed by a stone wheel powered by a
horse or ox walking round treadmill-style - abandoned in old orchards on
most farms round here,' he said.
He recently paid Pounds 600 for the stone mill that he is sure once made
perry and cider on his own farm: 'Bess, my old carthorse will probably be
dead by the time I get going, but I have four oxen and I will train them to
do the job. Perry is wonderful: smooth, full bodied and more sophisticated
than cider and much neglected. Fortunately a group of small producers* is
re-emerging round here and eventually I hope to be among them.'
First, however, Martell is perfecting the soft French-style cheese he
started making a year ago. It is made from his herd of Old Gloucester cattle
and washed in perry to form the red mould. It is aptly named Stinking
Bishop.
And the treacle mines? 'Nobody has managed to find them yet, though some
people swear they exist, just like the famous Oxford treacle well,' Martell
said. 'Perhaps it might all be something to do with the Dymock Trickle - a
coal seam that ran near here and was once mined near Oxenhall, three miles
away.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / Gardening: Bulbs for long-term growth - Tulips offer
satisfying returns to the careful investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All year, tulip-growers have been celebrating the 400th anniversary of the
tulip's first flowering in Holland; today, we celebrate its birthday with
theological correctness as a chapter in the history Mammon
Within 40 years of the tulip's first flowering, people were already
speculating in it madly. Instead of planting it, they bought tulip-futures,
sold them to the next man and left the bother of delivery and gardening to
the last mutt in the chain. Perhaps we should reintroduce them for
non-gardening readers in the winter. After the market crashed, one great
academic could never look a tulip in the face again. So many fortunes had
been lost that he would attack the tulips with a stick whenever he passed
them. I will be doing the same with dollars, if they carry on down.
Meanwhile, non-speculators ought to be planting their tulips during this
weekend and the next three. They prefer a sunny, well-drained soil and at
least 3 ins of it above the tops of their bulbs. If you plant them up to
9ins deep, they are safe from passing forks and can be left in the ground
for years. Nonetheless, many of them will not persist. Deep or shallow, they
will flower in the first year, dwindle in the second and disappear in the
third.
The growers tell us to dig them up each year in late May, bury them lightly
in a secondary bed and then pick them over in autumn to eliminate those
which have shrunk. These bulblets can then be replanted and grown on for up
to three years, like a small business, until they are ready again for public
display. I have never had the patience for this routine. Instead, I add a
dressing of potash fertiliser and dig it lightly into the surface of the
soil after planting. It helps to delay the dwindling.
Why do tulips deteriorate? I know three reasons. They miss the rich, silty
soil of Holland or Lincolnshire where the sellers grow them. There is
nothing we can do about that unless we move to the Netherlands.
Alternatively, they may have been eaten by slugs; an expert grower tells me
that this problem is much more widespread than other experts realise. Last
winter, slugs ate the leaves on all my scillas and I bet they had a go at
the tulips. The best defence is deep planting, down to 9ins, below the
slug-line. A top dressing of slug killer is worth the effort.
The third reason is the most regrettable. Many of the most impressive modern
varieties are simply not tough enough for full-size flowering after a year
or two in Britain's unimpressive garden soils. I have learned to prefer
proven varieties and choose the easier of the wild forms which are much
tougher.
If you want one persistent hybrid tulip, choose the one which has lasted
longest in the lists: pink Clara Butt. She has become less familiar nowadays
but she outlasts all others in her class. I also find that the lily-flowered
varieties retain their size of flower for many years. I have three proven
favourites: the yellow West Point, which is a real winner, the deep satin
China Pink, and the tall White Triumphator. So many of the other colours
shrink from year to year but if I was speculating for one season I would
always choose white Carrara, pink and white striped Marilyn, which looks so
stylish in pots, and the lovely lemon yellow Sweet Harmony, which is edged
with white. This spring, I saw several gardens where four or five
well-chosen varieties had been mixed in a multi-coloured cluster. The effect
was fresh, a change from those solemn lines of yellow, then pink which you
see in parks or on the mudflats by Dutch windmills. Nurserymen's mixtures
include some awful carmines but you can mix a selection for yourself.
The best value of all is found in the smaller forms which are closer to the
wild. The white tulip which lasts longest is the short Tulip fosteriana
Purissima; the most persistent striped form is the plain Water Lily tulip,
or kaufmanniana, which is a mixture of ivory yellow and red. Avoid its other
forms, seductively named after great musicians, because most of them are not
harmonious. Recently, I have learnt to value the lilac and yellow flowers of
Tulip bakeri Lilac Wonder, whose flowers open widely in April and have
persisted very well in a sharp, sunny soil. You would not expect a wild
tulip from central Asia to be reliable in the British midlands but I have
also had long life from the lovely soft yellow Tulip batalinii.
The nearer you return to the wild, the more stamina you find in many tulips.
They grow naturally from Greece to central Asia but it is extraordinary that
the ancient Greeks never mentioned them, although they lived with their
flowers each spring. They seem to puzzle their successors too. Not long ago,
I looked across a Greek olive grove of wild tulips in the company of two
great ancient historians who remarked that they never realised that the
Greeks imported so many tulips from Holland. Perhaps these non-botanists
would prefer tulip-futures instead, but we would have to take away their
walking-sticks if they lost bets.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Why antifreeze worked wonders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What German wine needs is a real humdinger of a scandal - widespread
addition of antifreeze perhaps - and the will to take it seriously.
The diethylene glycol debacle has certainly worked wonders for Austrian
wine. Nearly 10 years on, with fundamentally revised legislation and
painstaking quality control systems, the Austrian wine industry is so
freshly scrubbed and cloaked in virtue it is almost blindingly bright, while
the German wine business is stil shrouded in the grey mists of compromise
and rampant commercialism.
Fastidious American importers such as Vin DiVino, of Chicago, and Terry
Theise, of Milton S Kronheim &amp; Co, Washington DC, are fighting over
Austria's top wine producers, blasting their customers with phrases such as:
'I gotta warn you: prepare to be surprised, 'cause you ain't never tasted
stuff like dis.'
The British wine trade is proceeding rather more sedately, as is its wont.
If it does not act soon it will find that the Americans, the Germans and
even the Japanese (who import almost as much Austrian wine as the British)
will have snapped up all the top wines.
Austria suffers from the reverse problem to, say, Chile. It has ample
evidence of producing some of the world's finest wines: dry Rieslings, from
the Wachau and (often better value) neighbouring Kremstal and Kamptal;
Styrian varietals of Collio-like purity; and the most luscious botrytised
sweet wines from Burgenland. What it does not have is an ocean of seriously
cheap plonk to lap at the shores of the supermarkets  - except for an
extraordinary new product called Servus.
Very much designed, to sell at about Pounds 3 a bottle on British high
streets, it is an attempt by the new governor of Burgenland to shape some of
his state's surplus supply of basic white into something that will sustain
commercially viable viticulture in Burgenland, and tempt new wine drinkers
to try Austria. Producer Lenz Moser, one of the few big merchants to have
survived the scandal, is gambling on its success, marketing it defiantly in
a clear bordeaux bottle. It tastes crisp and unobjectionable - if
undistinguished.
The economy and geography of Austria, however, are probably best suited to
titillating connoisseurs. British wine drinkers prepared to spend Pounds 7
to Pounds 40 a bottle can find proof of Austria's uniquely dedicated new
generation of wine producers at the addresses listed below.
The parallel between Austrian and German wine is obvious, not just because
the label language and many of the grape varieties grown are the same, but
because the German wine industry today faces many of the same problems faced
by its Austrian counterpart in the early 1980s just before the glycol
scandal enforced a clean sweep.
Large commercial bottlers have forced Germany's grape prices down to such an
extent that German wines, which were prized above classed- growth bordeaux
at the turn of the century, are viewed by many as the lowest of the vinous
low. We enthusiasts continue to wave a flag for the quality-conscious
producing elite, but the country's reputation continues to be damaged by the
lax controls on what officially constitutes 'quality wine' (about 95 per
cent of production).
In fact the so-called anti-freeze scandal of 1985 reflected just as badly on
Germany as Austria. This harmless additive was used exclusively by a limited
number of Austrian merchants (not growers) to add body to sweet Austrian
wine and was subsequently found in many bottles of supposedly 'German' wine.
But the questions raised by this were never properly answered.
The Germans had a chance last year to reform their wine laws and they blew
it. Enormously high yields are still permitted, and there was no radical
reform of the complicated and often misleading nomenclature or the minimum
ripeness levels required for each category. It is left to the better
producers, such as (but by no means exclusively) those who belong to the VDP
group, to impose their own higher standards.
For the moment, the consumer is left at the end of the queue - but the
future is bleak for any wine producer which ignores the consumer in today's
market.
Some Austrian importers: Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk and T &amp; W Wines, of
Thetford, Norfolk (0842-765646) for Willy Opitz' crazy half-bottlings; Noel
Young, of Trumpington, Cambridgeshire (0223-844744) for Kracher sweet wines
and Pockl reds; Richard Nurick, of Pangbourne, Berkshire (0734-842565) for
Stiegelmar and Sonnhof; Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, for some fine
Styrian and Burgenland bottles; Richard Spiers Wines, of Guildford, Surrey
(0483-37605) for a small Kremstal and Burgunland selection; Forth Wines of
Milnathort, central Scotland (0577-862513) for some of Lenz Moser's estate
bottlings; The Wine Treasury of London SW6 (071-371 7131) for Skoff's
Styrians; The Grape Shop of London SW11 (071-924 3638) for Kolbl, Bauer and
Prechtl wines; and Penistone Court Wine Cellars, of Sheffield (0226-766037).
Important wholesalers of fine Austrian wine include Caxton Tower, of
Brentford, London, for Loiben, Fritz Salomon et al; and for some top quality
dry Rieslings FWW Wines, of Banstead, Surrey (081-786 8161) the new UK arm
of the excellent co-operative at Durnstein in the Wachau. Watch this space.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Spying tonight - chefs' secrets / Nicholas
Lander swaps information with French cook Alain Ducasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the fall of the Iron Curtain has brought an end to the careers of
many a James Bond, spying - eating in your competitors' restaurants, trying
to squeeze trade secrets out of suppliers or kitchen staff keen to move on -
is still endemic in the restaurant industry.
The Inland Revenue accepts it as part of a restaurateur's job, allowing 50
per cent of the cost of a meal taken not for pleasure but for education as a
legitimate business expense, providing it is accompanied by a written
restaurant report.
Last month, London, in particular Knightsbridge, were subjected to an
intense 48-hour spying mission conducted by Alain Ducasse, chef of the Louis
XV restaurant in the Hotel du Paris, Monaco and, at 37, the youngest of
France's 19 three-star Michelin chefs.
Ducasse has been hired as consultant chef to a new club which will open on
Sloane Street in late spring 1995. His job includes designing and equipping
the kitchen; writing the menus; hiring kitchen staff; and, most importantly,
responsibility for the presentation, cooking and look of the food served in
the restaurant and bar.
Before this trip Ducasse had spent only nine days in Britain. During the
mid-1970s he had been a commis chef at The Bell Inn, Aston Clinton,
Buckinghamshire. His memories are of wonderful ingredients, invariably
overcooked, and of thick fog, which swiftly drove him back to France.
Ducasse embarked on a series of culinary 'stages', most significantly with
Alain Chapel at Mionnay. In August 1984, flying with other chefs to a
business meeting in Courchevel, Ducasse was the sole survivor when an
aircraft crashed into a mountain.
He waited 10 hours for the rescue team. This experience has left him assured
of his own skills and right to succeed but, at the same time, humble enough
to recognise the thin line between success and oblivion.
It was this humility which brought us together. Ducasse phoned me to ask
whether I would arrange and chaperone him on his first visit to London. In
return, he suggested, I should come out to Monaco, eat his food and meet his
suppliers.
We met and ate in what Ducasse calls his 'Aquarium', a cubicle just big
enough for a small dining table and four chairs with glass sliding doors
that looks out on to his immaculate kitchen.
As we sat and talked, Ducasse watched as Laurent, his experienced sous-chef,
took the 21-strong brigade through a busy service.
Transfixed by the speed and elegance of a disciplined kitchen brigade, I ate
superbly. The highlights were a delicate, creamy pheasant soup with
chestnuts and a line-caught turbot cooked en cocotte with glistening ceps.
The following morning, I met the unsung stars of Ducasse's kitchen: Rene
Schmidt who, with his wife, picks fraises de bois every morning between 6am
and 9am in a particular micro-climate along the hills above Nice and then
delivers them to the top restaurants of the area; Madame Paulette Stropiana
who, every morning, single-handedly (her husband does not like goats) milks
21 goats and then makes the most delicious chevre in a bergerie without
electricity - it is so isolated that the cheeses have to be brought down by
donkey; and finally, Philippe Catananzi, who displayed his fruit and
vegetables and proudly told me that tomorrow a similar consignment would be
sent via Nice and Geneva airports to the restaurants and hotels of Hong
Kong.
Ducasse acknowledged that creating a network of such suppliers could not
happen immediately and understood when I explained that his first visit
would just give him an overview of the best of British produce.
Sandwiched between site meetings with builders, Ducasse's itinerary
included: visits to Harrods' and Harvey Nichols' food halls; Soho's
Chinatown; a 4.30am start to see Smithfield, Billingsgate and Covent Garden;
a view of the game on offer at R. Allen &amp; Co, Mayfair, and tastings of wild
Scottish smoked salmon, Morecambe Bay potted shrimps and the best breads
baked in London.
He found a late afternoon cheese tasting at Neal's Yard in Covent Garden
exciting. Eating a couple of English apples from the Neal's Yard display, he
drooled with pleasure over Colston Bassett stilton, Cheshire, Keen's Cheddar
and a sheep's milk cheese called Emlett.
He returned again and again to taste the unpasteurised Jersey double cream
produced by SE Lane &amp; Partners, of Kent which, he was forced to admit, was
better than anything he could buy in France.
Restaurant espionage took place over lunch at Marco Pierre White's The
Restaurant, where Ducasse was impressed by the technical excellence of the
young British brigade. Dinner was eaten at Bibendum where the quality of the
main course and wine list were only surpassed by the dessert - an
old-fashioned steamed ginger pudding.
This, Ducasse admitted, as he scraped the plate clean 'is the kind of
dessert I have no idea how to make' while making a note to write to the
chef, Simon Hopkinson, for the recipe.
Finally, to lunch at Sally Clarke's restaurant in Kensington Church Street,
west London, where Ducasse could see the same quality of vegetables and
salads that he buys in France: delicious salad leaves and herbs from Halcyon
Herbs, Oxfordshire and perfectly cooked Linzer Delicatesse potatoes grown by
Adrian Barran in Suffolk.
A novel gastronomic experience was a sampling of homemade oatmeal biscuits.
Ducasse found them so impressive he ordered an extra helping.
Ducasse left for Heathrow as a British holidaymaker leaves France - with a
shopping bag full of food. But, instead of saucisson, baguettes and
fromages, his bag contained cuts of Scottish beef, pots of Jersey double
cream, oatmeal biscuits and Hopkinson's book Roast Chicken and Other
Stories. (Ebury Press, Pounds 17.99, 230 pages).
Even James Bond never ate so well.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Bells starts to trade up - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do you do when you are a whisky company faced with a decline in whisky
consumption as well as a disaffection among the younger drinkers in favour
of Bourbon and vodka?
If you are Bells you trade up. Instead of the old five-year-old Bells whisky
the stuff in the bottle is now eight years old. What is more, the price
remains the same.
With nearly half the malt whisky distilleries in its portfolio, United
Distillers certainly has the wherewithal to make a great blended whisky.
The percentage of malt in the new Bells has not changed. The company says,
simply, that it has altered the 'balance'. Still, about 60 per cent of the
whisky is grain from the UP Cameronbridge distillery.
The main malts are Glenkinchie, Blair Atholl, Dufftown, Linkwood, Inchgower,
Oban and Caol Ila. Both the Dufftown and a percentage of the Linkwood have a
heavy sherry treatment. The sherry shows on the new Bells. Whereas the old
'tinker' had a slightly disagreeable rancid character, the new Bells has a
more finely-tuned toffee and raisins flavour from the sherry.
Now that most of the large cognac houses seem to have abandoned the UK for
the more profitable far eastern market, it is a rare pleasure to see someone
still actively selling cognac and good cognac too.
Delamain cognacs come from Jarnac on the Charente. The family can trace its
participation in the brandy business back to the eary 17th century and is
the last privately-owned merchant house in the region, with Alain Braastad
at the helm, on his mother's side a direct descendant of the founders of the
house.
Delamain is special in that it sells only Grande Champagne cognacs which are
25-years-old and over. This means that all their brandies have that rancio
character: the aromas of rich fruitcake.
Pale and Dry is an average of 25 years, a cognac of great breeding and
delicacy. Many prefer it to the more expensive Vesper which averages 35
years and is a heavier, woodier cognac. The oldest commercially available is
the Tres Venerable, which is between 50 and 60 years old. (At around 60
years cognac is normally removed from casks to prevent it from becoming too
woody.) This cognac has a persistence on the palate which lingers for
minutes.
It is worth shopping around for Pale and Dry as there are considerable
variations in price: La Reserve, 56 Walton Street, London SW3. (071-589
2020), Pounds 45; Selfridges (071-629 1234) Pounds 42.50; Reid Wines, The
Mill, Hallatrow Bristol (01761-452645) Pounds 35; and Lea and Sandeman, 301
Fulham Road, SW10 and 211 Kensington Church Street, W8 (071-376 4767) Pounds
36.50. Lea and Sandeman also stocks Vesper at Pounds 49 and Tres Venerable
at Pounds 98.99.

FT  12 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Hair ornaments and the art of seduction -
Jane Mulvagh suggests that exotic Chinese jewellery, with a past, could be
used to add sparkle to that little black dress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If a Chinese concubine from the Qing Dynasty court of the Forbidden City
were to survey the social scene in Britain today, she would assume that we
are also subject to strict sumptuary laws.
For every woman at a party would seem to her to be dressed the same: in a
little black dress.
She would sympathise because depending on her rank (first, second, or
lower-ranked concubine), she too was subjected to complex rulings on dress
and make-up, policed by unforgiving eunuchs.
Confined to modest green robes in the spring and summer, and dark brown or
violet for the autumn and winter, her only means of expressing coquetry in
order to catch her emperor's eye - amid thousands of rival beauties - and
perchance win even one night with him, was to employ the seductive charms of
hair ornaments.
Made from metal, sometimes silver, the basis of the ornament was gilded by
the Imperial Workshops in the Department of the Privy Purse. They are
typically in the shape of an Oriental peach, basket, dragonfly, phoenix,
plum blossom or orchid.
To this frame the master craftsman added filigree work filled in with the
feathers of the Common Kingfisher which, according to the Natural History
Museum, became extinct at the beginning of this century.
But the luminescent turquoise alone, radiating out against their shiny black
hair, flawless white complexions and vermillion lips, was not enough in the
face of fierce sexual competition at The Palace of Beauty.
So trembling wire spirals were added to support lambent Peking glass beads,
coral, rock crystal, pearls and tiny jade and garnet ornaments, that
glittered and shuddered with promise.
These ornaments, worn by the thousands of concubines, wives, actresses and
ladies-in-waiting, were either pinned as single elements straight into the
hair or were sewn on to black felt coiffes or headcovers.
The pursuit of allure was a full-time occupation for these slaves to beauty
and it was encouraged by the Empress who 'regarded us as her jewels'.
In her Memoires as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Cixi at the Forbidden City,
He Rong Er explains: 'We were expected to glow like jade objects whose
luminescence revealed their true and intrinsic beauty and preciousness, as
opposed to mere glass ornaments and gewgaws which would shine with a
superficial brightness.'
These kingfisher fripperies were worn widely in the 18th and 19th centuries.
An impressive collection can be seen at the Palace Museum in The Forbidden
City in Beijing, but most were burnt - along with books, furniture and other
household artefacts - during the Cultural Revolution, despised as wicked
relics of the capitalist old world.
Some were kept hidden by retired courtiers or commoners who bought them as
souvenirs of a city they had never been permitted to enter. Today they fetch
between Pounds 150 and Pounds 700 (for a pair).
Deploying some Ancien regime allure this season will add twinkle against the
fashionable black backdrop.
And these collector's items, whether worn or displayed on your lover's desk
to remind him of your charms, may even bring you good fortune in the New
Year, for when Emperor Ch'ien-lung ordered ornaments to be made for the New
Year, the workshops made several which invited the wish: 'May You Have As
Much Good Fortune as the Eastern Ocean Hairpin, the Glorious Spring Hairpin,
the Peace in the Four Seas Hairpin, and the Happiness of Seeing Red Plum
Blossom Hairpin.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: An open and shut case . . . - Heather
Farmbrough finds out what makes a good holdall
</HEADLINE>

For every Weekend FT reader who regards buying a briefcase as a tedious but
unavoidable chore, there will be another who delights in the soft leather
and subtle colours of a well-made case.
To some, a briefcase is simply a concession to professional convention -
there are far easier ways to carry things than in a small box which makes
one's shoulders ache.
To others, however, a briefcase is as essential an accessory as a pair of
good shoes, a reliable indicator of its owner's style and personality.
Even if you think of briefcases as dull but practical necessities, there is
no reason to settle for a boring box; over the last few years, briefcase
design has become increasingly sophisticated and imaginative.
It is possible to find a relatively robust simple one for around Pounds 100
but there are, it seems, plenty of people who will spend Pounds 600 on a
briefcase and expect it to last for their career.
If you are paying these kinds of sums you usually get a life-time guarantee
for your money. For instance in London, Swaine, Adeney, Brigg &amp; Sons, of
Piccadilly, (071-734 4277) and The Coach Store, 8 Sloane Street (071-235
1507) will carry out reasonable repairs free of charge.
If you are thinking of buying a new briefcase it is worth spending some time
thinking about what you really need.
Does sturdiness matter most or do you want more of a style statement? Do you
need a conventional case or would you prefer to be a little more
adventurous? Do you want a case which you can simply reach inside without
having to put on a flat surface to open? And do you need a lock, or are you
the kind of person who is bound to lose the key or forget the combination?
Few people think carefully before buying. Most people seem to acquire
briefcases in a haphazard way. We asked some of our readers how they had
come by theirs.
Alex Rhodes, a 34-year-old director of a qualitative market research company
acquired her briefcase accidentally. 'My husband had always wanted a decent
briefcase and he bought one in the Coach sale. I took one look at it and
said it was much too feminine because it had a shoulder strap. I thought he
was going to take it back and exchange it, but he left it on my bed with a
note saying it was a present for me.
'I love the strap - it's much easier to carry when you're also carrying a
hand-bag. The front pockets are useful and the zip on the small pocket at
the back stops my business cards falling out. There's plenty of room: I've
got two folders in here, an A4 pad, a Filofax, pens, tape-recorder and a
compartment for a newspaper.
'My old one was much larger and harder wearing, but this feels much smarter.
It makes a big difference - I feel as if this makes me look more
professional.'
Barry Jones, a 43-year-old management consultant, was more than a little
annoyed when the locks broke on his 10-month old case from Swaine, Adeney,
Brigg, particularly, as he says: 'I was at a clients' meeting when the lock
broke; I couldn't open my briefcase to get out the slides I'd prepared,
which was extremely embarrassing.
'I took it back to the shop the next morning and was asked for proof of
purchase; this annoyed me because when you pay a ridiculous amount of money
for a hand-made briefcase you don't expect the retailer to question you.
'Now my most important requirement is that a briefcase is relatively robust
and won't collapse if I crush too much in. I chose this one because it
looked strong and well made and I thought it would last a long time, but in
reality it didn't.
'Does it matter to clients what kind of briefcase I have? No, I don't think
clients really care. What matters more is that it shouldn't have a label. On
the whole I just think it's important to have a briefcase that looks
professional.'
Paul Mullins, a 34-year-old merchant banker, puts practical considerations
before appearance. He has a two-year-old Papworth which was a gift. Its
greatest asset, he says, is that it's made from very stiff leather - the
kind used for bridles or saddles - and has no frame.
'I want as much space as possible; I find it odd that most cases are too
small to fit in even two pads of A4 paper side by side. It is quite heavy -
but if a briefcase is really heavy then you're carrying too much or not
delegating enough.
'The combination locks have both broken so I've had them changed to
key-locks. Briefcase locks all tend to be appalling - but then it's usually
completely inessential to lock a briefcase. If someone steals it, they'll
probably open it anyway with a crowbar.
'I doubt this will last much more than 10 years. I want a long-lasting case
 -I'm not interested in brand names. I look on buying a briefcase as a
distress purchase - if you go much beyond Pounds 300 then you're starting to
pay for image.'
Nigel Crump, 43, takes this theory one step further and has rejected a
conventional briefcase in favour of a 13in by 13in brown and black fabric
shoulder/satchel bag. As an architect and builder he rarely wears a suit,
with which, he says, his bag might look incongruous.
'I think it's called a jolly bag - I bought it in Hong Kong for about Pounds
20, 10 years ago. It has two pockets at the front, compartments and a flap
inside and it does up with a zip. It's a sturdy practical bag; it contains a
camera, telephone, measuring tape, drawing pad and clipboard.' He needs to
be able to carry it while on building sites so the shoulder strap is
important.
'I've kept it because it's very practical. I don't care what anyone else
thinks of it, but I daresay in certain professions it would be viewed with
suspicion. I keep thinking I must change and get a nice old fashioned
leather case but I just haven't got round to it.'
Whatever you choose you must feel comfortable.
Andrew Mitchell, a 42-year-old chairman of an advertising agency has a Loewe
case which he has never dared use. 'It was a leaving present from my
previous agency, but it's so lovely I feel I can't take it on the
Underground. Come the day when I can drive to work again, I'll use it. In
the meantime, I'm using a black Samsonite PVC attache case with aluminium
trim, about 3in deep, which my father gave me when I was 10.
'I'm a pretty big chap - I'm 6ft 1in - but I was mugged a year ago on the
Tube in the rush hour. I was absolutely determined not to let go of my case
which was wrenched from me and split open, the handle twisted.
'But I still use it; I carry all my expense forms, pens, a calculator and a
file. If I were choosing another, I'd go for a basic holdall, perhaps
slightly bigger.
'I'd want sleeves or folders in the lid because I always carry agency
brochures. In the meantime, I'm hanging on to this; I'm very emotionally
attached to it. I've been using it consistently for 32 years and I don't
have the heart to throw it away.'

to act
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1. How much will your children's education cost? When will you need to pay
out? How much you should put away now each month?
2. Are you making the most of your children's tax allowances?
3. Is it worth considering re-mortgaging? Should you look at a fixed-rate
deal?
4. Do you have enough insurance? Check your cover for life insurance,
permanent health insurance (sick pay insurance which pays for extended
periods off work due to illness), private medical insurance, critical
illness insurance (a sort of life insurance which pays out before you die if
you become seriously ill), and long-term care insurance (to pay for nursing
homes).
5. Are you paying enough into your pension plan? If you are in an employer's
scheme, should you be making extra payments to an additional voluntary
contribution plan?
6. How much cash do you have on deposit? Should you shift more of it into
higher-risk/higher-return equity-based investments?
7. Do you have the right mix of income and growth investments?
8. Is your portfolio balanced properly to reflect the risk you want to take?
9. Are your affairs organised in the most tax-efficient way?
10. Have you updated your will to make clear who should inherit your wealth
after you die? Is there scope for making gifts while alive? Have you
arranged things to keep the taxman's take to a minimum?

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Make the most of your
cash - Anthony Bailey begins a series on budgeting through life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BAILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is, ultimately, only one reason for having money: to spend it. But a
problem for most people is that they never seem to have quite enough of the
stuff.
Financial planning can help to square the circle, though. The art is to use
income, savings and investments in the most tax-efficient and suitable way
now to produce the money you need to spend in future.
No two people's lives are the same, of course. So, when it comes to
generalising on financial planning needs throughout a typical life, many
people will spot ways in which they are atypical.
Some become grandparents in their 40s while their peers are just starting
out on raising a family. Many go on to higher education in their late
'teens. Others do not taste university life until much later, while some
return to the lecture room for a second time as mature students.
The majority will spend their working lives as employees but some will set
up in business on their own. But the dream of abandoning a high-paying,
wheeler-dealer City job to run an antiquarian bookshop in Surrey is more
likely to become a reality if plotting the escape route begins early.
Our lifetime chart of financial hurdles can be only a generalisation. But
most people will find in it some pointers to their own future and, perhaps,
more than just one or two holes in their present plannning.
The 20s
This is a time when spending desires and resources may feel most out of
kilter. Would it not be a better system if people could enjoy their
retirement while they were young and healthy, travel the world, have a good
time - and then enter the labour market at the age of 40? Alas, it does not
work like that.
Young people who still live with their parents may find themselves flush
with cash. They are, in fact, in a good position to spend just a little less
on clothes, holidays and fast cars and put money aside for various future
needs. But many twentysomethings are burdened with debts acquired during
student days. They struggle to pay the rent.
Friendly banks are more than happy to allow large overdrafts to run for
years if they are raking in charges. But it is usually possible to find
cheaper ways to borrow and to wipe out the debts over a planned period.
Strictly speaking, it is illogical to save money while the cost of borrowing
elsewhere exceeds the interest earned. In practice, the discipline of saving
money each month through a standing order is more likely to produce a cash
sum which will be needed, for instance, to buy a home.
The 30s and 40s
If you felt hard-up in your 20s, the real problems of juggling with money
can begin when you take on a mortgage, a marriage and babies. Commitments
and responsibilities mean bills have to be met. The fanciful option of
giving up work and touring the world is no longer there. And where there
were two incomes when first you set up home with a partner, there might now
be only one.
The key to achieving long-term financial security is to consider things like
pensions, personal equity plans and life insurance as essential rather than
optional spending. Budget accordingly.
The 50s
These can turn out to be something of a golden age. Income from employment
is likely to be at its highest, children may have left home (or be
contributing to the household budget) and the mortgage could be nearly paid
off.
It should be a golden age for financial planning, too. But it could also be
a period of worry and panic if you have not yet started to think seriously
about retirement. Now is the time to look carefully at pension provision and
all other investments.
Work out when you can afford to retire, where you want to live, and how much
money you will need. Do not forget the reality of old age 30 years hence -
the extra costs of health problems, domestic help and perhaps, one day,
full-time nursing care.
The 60s and 70s
Good health and mental attitude willing, a planned retirement can be well
worth the wait. The prime concern will be the delicate balancing act of
maximising investment income while protecting capital to guard against
inflation.
Those who have built up a good reserve of assets will also be juggling with
another problem - passing on wealth to avoid inheritance tax while retaining
sufficient resources to see them through the 80s and and even 90s. Advice is
essential - and so is making sure you do not leave yourself short.
The 80s and beyond
Life can become expensive, and even low levels of inflation may now be
making an erstwhile good pension package look paltry. But if you have spent
a lifetime of careful financial planning, then you should be able to avoid a
cash crisis.
Is it really possible to square a recalcitrant circle? That is a question we
will try to answer in the rest of this series.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Fashion: Menswear still marches to military bea - Fatigues
are 'in' with chic young clubbers, but Richard Rawlinson sees old soldiers
and sailors wherever he looks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This season, international menswear designers from Ralph Lauren to Dolce e
Gabbana have taken inspiration from military uniforms. Colours range from
rifle brown to gunmetal grey and cut and detail take on a parade ground
formality.
While Versus, Gianni Versace's diffusion line, offers herringbone pea coats
with military buttons and slim 'guards' leg trousers, Valentino presents
suits with storm flap pockets and epaulettes.
Katharine Hamnett's camouflage trousers are being worn by young night
clubbers along with khaki Gap T-shirts and combat boots, Ferre's fur-trimmed
parka coats would be appropriate for polar expeditions, his greatcoats for
first world war trenches.
Carlos de Freitas, menswear buyer for London department store Harrods, says
the military influence is a perennial favourite. 'It comes round cyclically
and this time Ralph Lauren has created the look with green skinny-rib
roll-neck jumpers under quilted coats and also country tweeds and cords. It
is all part of the continuing interest in practical clothes for active
lifestyles.'
Inno Aguib, menswear buyer for London designer store Browns, says the
military mood among designers is influenced by styles on the streets of New
York and London, whose younger inhabitants have, for a long time, worn
secondhand army gear. 'Dolce e Gabbana often take their inspiration directly
from street fashion,' he says. Their collection includes combat trousers and
Ethree quarter length army coat/jackets.
Horse guards, Vietnam GIs and colonial officers may be marching into
fashion, but military clothing has a much deeper influence. The origins of
most of today's civilian tailoring - whether for a double-breasted overcoat,
a single-breasted suit or a fashionable Nehru collared jacket  - can lie in
the naval and military uniforms of 200 years ago.
The classic suit worn by the professional classes of the 19th and 20th
centuries were not created by the Giorgio Armanis of the day. They evolved
from the uniforms of the armed forces.
Before the end of the 18th century, uniform coats were round-necked and
collarless, rather like the Beatles' jackets of the 1960s or some modern
Chanel women's jackets. They were worn either completely buttoned up or
buttoned back on themselves to reveal a triangular-shaped dash of
distinctive lining. The lining was usually white to contrast the darker
shade of the coat. It formed the basis for the lapel as we know it, although
the fold-down collar had not yet been devised.
By the 19th century, stand-up, tunic-style collars had been introduced to
uniforms, buttoning up below the chin to protect the neck from the elements
without the need for flouncy, Beau Brummel-style cravats. When the stand
collar was turned down, it formed the ghillie collar or the top half of the
contemporary lapel. The front part of the lapel was still part of the coat's
torso but, when it too was turned back, it established the precursor of
today's two-piece lapel with a notch at each side, or gorge cut, as it is
known.
The gorge cut has been stylised over the years to sit comfortably on the
neck, shoulder and chest. But if you put up your jacket collar, you will
still be able to identify its origins - the collar stands up like that of a
tunic and the front sections will kiss at the tips of the notches.
The buttonhole on the left side of the lapel is not merely to insert flowers
into, but is a continuation of an historic tradition in men's tailoring.
That also explains why truly authentic double-breasted suits should have
button holes on both sides.
Nowadays only shooting coats have a button corresponding to the lapel
button, allowing protection from the wind and rain on grouse moors. But most
early examples of the jacket, particularly country clothes worn by estate
workers and artisans, buttoned high like the military tunic.
The more adventurous and monied aristocracy and the expanding bourgeoisie,
wishing to show off their expensively starched cravats, began to have their
coats cut with a lower revers.
Tailors experimented with the fundamental component of the coat for the sole
purpose of aestheticism. The cuff buttons originated after the evolution of
the civilian frock coat out of the military uniform, but it also has more to
do with function than fashion.
In the Victorian era, protocol decreed that gentlemen wore coats in public.
They were deemed undressed if they revealed their shirts. Doctors, for
example, who needed to wash their hands in front of patients, required cuff
buttons which could be undone, allowing them to roll up their sleeves before
their ablutions at the basin. Modern off-the-peg suits usually have fake
buttonholes in order to cut the cost of manufacturing, but bespoke suits
still have working cuff buttons.
Most menswear designers continue to show more concern for traditions than
innovation. While womenswear designers often let their imaginations run
wild, men's tailoring changes little from decade to decade. Menswear
designers may alter the number of buttons for a jacket, the shape of its
lapel and the flaps of its pockets for decorative purposes.
They may decree that the sporty preppy look is 'in' one season and the
effete, Edwardian dandy look the next. But they are faithful to certain
rules, set down by previous generations.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Helping the shopaholics
 -Lucy Kellaway explains how
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What is a shopaholic?
Shopaholics are people who buy things they do not need or even want, mainly
for the thrill of it. They do it in a repeated, uncontrolled way that
distinguishes them from everyday people who sometimes buy things on impulse
to cheer themselves up.
Why do they do it?
Some are unhappy and have low self-esteem. Others do it to overcome bouts of
depression. A few are motivated by boredom; others by the sheer fun of
buying.
Is it increasing?
There are no precise figures available but Lancaster University's Richard
Elliott believes all the major contributing factors are rising. These
include availability of credit; disposable income; and advertising that
makes you believe you will become a better, happier person from buying
something.
Does it have side-effects?
Many shopaholics feel extreme guilt and anxiety. Most also have the stress
of carrying a heavy secret, as few are prepared to discuss the problem. What
help is there?
There are two debt advice services to which they can turn: the National Debt
Line in Birmingham, and the Consumer Credit Counselling Service in Leeds.
Most shopaholics have their credit cards taken away before they are
threatened with bankruptcy (although it ends that way for some). But, as
Miranda (whose case was reported on page 1) found, an Individual Voluntary
Arrangement can be a better option through being more discreet and, often,
allowing repayment in a way the debtor can afford.
An IVA involves getting 75 per cent of creditors to agree to a schedule of
payments they believe is both reasonable and achievable. In Miranda's case,
it meant paying off 25 per cent of the debt over three years.
Are shopaholics a major problem for card companies?
Recent research from the Policy Studies Institute shows that 18 per cent of
those who defaulted on credit card repayments in 1992 had spent too much. Of
these, about half were over-spent because of a drop in income; less than 8
per cent were in default through profligate spending.
The report said three things would help reduce the level of bad debts: Card
companies should:
1. Appraise the behaviour and creditworthiness of existing clients
continually, rather than just at the start.
2. Be more selective about increasing credit ceilings. At the moment,
increases are too automatic.
3. Have access to more information about clients at the outset. At present,
credit rating agencies have details only of county court judgments - not how
much the client owes other creditors.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Feedback . . . -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JH ALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I read with great interest the article in the Weekend FT (November 5) by
Kevin Goldstein-Jackson headlined: 'The wrong policies'. I agree entirely
that 'people should be encouraged to create and manage their own pension
fund, rather than having to invest through an institution'. I would,
however, prefer this to apply to Peps.
These were introduced as an incentive to the private investor to save and
invest in the stock market. But the only real winners have been fund
managers and brokers whose income has been increased through the purchase
and ongoing management charges of Peps.
I feel that to encourage people to manage their own personal pension fund
would be too politically sensitive because, if it failed, the individual
might become reliant on state benefits (ie, income support, housing benefit,
etc.). But this should not be the case with Peps, as their pension should
still be available.
I appreciate that this would not have the same impact on the balance of
shareholder power. But if more people were attracted to Peps, it would be a
step in the right direction to increasing that power.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Verbal, but is it
binding? - Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years ago, I bought shares in the private company for which I was then
working. At the time, I was told I could not sell them without board
approval. Later, I was informed that, if I found a buyer, I would have to
offer them first at the same price to other shareholders. But since I did
not sign any document/s, am I bound to do any of this?
Verbal agreements are enforceable, so the fact that you did not actually
sign any document/s may not necessarily be relied upon. In any case, other
shareholders may well give you a better price for your shares. (Murray
Johnstone).

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Power of attorney -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I hold power of attorney over my wife's assets since, approaching 78, she is
not capable of managing her financial affairs. Should I die before her, she
will need to be cared for in a nursing home.
I have been advised by a solicitor to include in my will the following
clause: 'My trustees shall hold my residuary estate upon trust as to both
capital and income for the use and benefit of my said wife during her
lifetime.'
I know that if I leave my estate to my wife absolutely, she would not have
to pay inheritance tax. But could the arrangement above result in an IHT
liability?
If you leave the assets either directly to your wife or in trust for her,
then the inter-spouse exemption should apply so that no IHT should be
payable on your estate. But the value of the assets held by your wife, or
under the trust arrangement, would form part of her estate for IHT purposes
when she dies. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward).

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Pension for a student -
Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it possible to take out a personal pension scheme on the basis of
unearned (interest) income, and/or temporary work, which exceeds the tax
allowance? I am a full-time student, single, aged 29. This tax year, I will
receive approximately Pounds 3,500 (gross) in interest, which will be taxed
at source, and Pounds 2,400 (gross) through temporary employment over the
summer, which also was taxed at source.
I realise I can claim back tax on the first Pounds 3,445 (personal
allowance), but this still means I am paying tax on about Pounds 2,400. Does
this qualify as taxable income from which I can make tax-free contributions
to a personal plan?
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR78 (Personal pensions: a guide
for tax). Although you could make a small payment into a personal pension
scheme, it does not look as though that would make economic sense.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Minimising tax liability
 -Briefcase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I will lose my job at the end of the year and do not expect to work again
but my wife will continue to do so. Her salary is around Pounds 60,000 and
we have Pounds 200,000 of investments held in joint names. Can we change
these investments to my name only to minimise tax liability? And could we
reverse the process in the future to maximise capital gains tax exemption?
As a general principle, we do not recommend that married women hand all
their investments over to their husbands absolutely. In any case, the fact
that re-transfer is contemplated in the future would defeat your tax
avoidance scheme because half the income would be deemed still to be your
wife's (by virtue of section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988).

interest-bearing shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a
building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption
date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your
investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of
capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the
table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically
not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the
market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy
and sell.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Gilt issues - best
value v tax status
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to
higher rate taxpayers.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Fashion: For women who wear the trousers - Lucia van der
Post greets a collection that is soft, appealing and well-priced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are, as any woman will tell you, trouser suits and trouser suits.
There are those that are deliberately, primarily even, ambiguous. These are
worn when a woman is at her most supremely confident, when she feels
assertive, mean, moody, able to take on the world. They have a hint of
cross-dressing, a whisper of the decadent. This is the trouser suit that
Yves Saint Laurent so memorably brought to life when he became the first
designer (way back in 1969) to show us all the sexual punch that a woman
dressed in a sharply-cut, mannish suit could wield. This is the sort that
every woman who seeks to be at the edge of fashion will want to have in her
wardrobe this season.
Then there are the trouser suits that purvey a different message - soft,
feminine, slightly waifish. Here is a woman vulnerable in a man's world, no
hint of androgeny or sexual power. Unstructured, with easy trousers and
accommodating waistlines, these are suits that whisper gently, that hint at
curves instead of silhouetting them. These are the trouser suits a woman
dons when she wants above all to be comfortable, to be able to run for a bus
or a tube, when she wants practical clothing for sitting in an office or
travelling in an aeroplane.
Trousers, as a regular acceptable part of the female wardrobe, have arrived
only recently. As Alison Lurie points out in The Language of Clothes it was
not until the late 1960s that 'trouser suits finally became elegant as well
as respectable, and underwear vanished or mutated into harmless forms. Even
before the second wave of women's liberation got underway, the long struggle
for comfort and freedom in female dress seem to have been won at last'.
Today, many working women like nothing more than to indulge in a bit of
role-playing - ambiguously, sharply-suited by night, relaxed, comfortable,
easy by day.
For those looking for the unashamedly practical trouser suit, the sort that
is smart enough to go the office (and today there are fewer and fewer
offices where trouser suits are still not allowed) and comfortable enough
for easy striding out, a newish name on the scene to look out for is Sahza
The label is the un-camel-like product of design by committee.
The collection was created by the vast Italian clothing manufacturer, GFT
Donna. It is carefully targeted at the modern, probably working, woman. The
brief to the design team was that the look should above all be soft and
practical and that prices should be middle of the road.
With almost no publicity it has already become hugely successful. At Fenwick
of New Bond Street, London W1 it was only introduced last autumn and was
such a success that this autumn it has been given twice the space on the
very prominent first floor. According to Mary Flack of Fenwick: 'It is
exactly right for the working woman. It is a clever combination of separates
with jackets that work with trousers or skirts. There are lots of pieces
that can mix together, though perfect for the office it isn't boring and its
prices are way below designer labels.'
At Harvey Nichols, too, where it was first sold in the spring / summer of
1993, it has proved a wow and has been given a whole wall to itself.
Sahza does equally soft and easy to wear skirts and jackets. There is a
whole collection of knitwear which can be teamed with the trousers and
skirts.
Sketched here are three of its suits for the coming winter. The Sahza label
is widely available but probably the biggest selection is at Harvey Nichols
of Knightsbridge, London SW1, and Fenwick of New Bond Street, London W1.
Other stockists are Flannels of Manchester and Jenners of Edinburgh. For a
local stockist tel: 071-629 5592.

options with particular reference to likely yield, risk, charges and tax.
Our chart shows how wide your choice is. But don't just dive in - make sure
you know where you stand and where you are heading. Work out how much income
you need now and how much you expect to need in future. Match these figures
against your expected income from all sources, taking account of factors
such as any automatic increases in pension. How big is the gap? (If there is
no gap, you should probably be concentrating on capital growth, not income).
Work out how much money you have spare to invest after providing fully for
essentials such as pension top-ups. What income do you need to get from that
money to plug your projected income gap? (Do not forget that most types of
income are taxable at your highest rate. If you are a 40 per cent taxpayer
and want an extra income of Pounds 6,000 a year, you normally need an
additional investment income of Pounds 10,000 a year before tax).
As a very rough guide, if your sums suggest that you need a gross investment
yield of 4 per cent or less, you are laughing: virtually all the investments
in our chart will meet that with room to spare. If you need a gross yield of
8 per cent or more, you could well have problems.
You can probably find such a yield (see our highest rates table on Page 8),
but only by investing in something with virtually no scope for capital
growth. So, the real value of your capital and your income is going to be
whittled away gradually by inflation.
If you need a yield of somewhere between 4 and 8 per cent, you will - like
most people - have to compromise. Some of your money probably will have to
be kept in investments offering a high immediate yield but no capital or
income growth. You can, however, afford to have some in index-linked or
equity-related investments which offer better long-term prospects of keeping
pace with inflation.
Decide which characteristics you want in your investments: security of
capital, security of income, both, or neither. Use our chart to find which
types of investment will fit your particular needs. But note that many of
the investments shown have these characteristics only if held for certain
periods. Most are unsuitable for people who might want their money back in a
hurry.
We will be explaining all the different groups of income investments in more
detail over the next few weeks.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Income): Ten simple rules you
should watch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are 10 simple rules to remember when checking out an investment:
The higher the income, the more you should investigate the security of the
investment. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Beware, in particular, of high-income guarantees from small banks and
finance houses - they may not be secure.
The higher the income, the less chance of capital appreciation. Can you
afford to take a high income at the expense of long-term growth? Does the
product use part of your capital to maintain the income if returns are lower
than expected?
Over the past 30 years, the value of income from equities has, on average,
doubled every seven years.
Other things being equal, the capital value of a well-chosen unit trust,
investment trust or portfolio of shares should increase - although not
necessarily at the same rate.
But remember that, with these investments, the income and capital value will
fluctuate.
Check thoroughly any strings attached to high-guaranteed income rates from
building societies. The rate might be fixed for just a few months before
falling below standard rates.
Deposit rates from the major banks are not competitive at present but, if
base rates rise, the banks tend to respond more quickly than building
societies.
Check the underlying investments of any collective vehicle that offers a
very high income - income unit trusts, for one. It might be invested in
companies about to cut dividends; rely on futures and options to boost the
yield; or take management costs out of capital rather than income.
Some investments, such as the income shares of split level investment
trusts, offer what appears to be an outstandingly high income but will pay
back little or nothing of your original capital. This is not a market for
novices.
Examine the assumptions used by high-income bonds. Some promise to return
your capital only if the underlying investments increase by, say, 10 per
cent a year.
Tax-efficiency is important. First, make good use of your tax allowances
(see table). Second, invest (where possible) through a tax-efficient vehicle
 -say, a personal pension or personal equity plan - but do watch for high
charges that can eliminate any tax advantages.
The over-riding consideration is performance and the likely rate of return
after charges and tax.
Remember that tax treatment of different investment vehicles can change, as
can your personal tax circumstances. Review your portfolio regularly and
consider a spread of investment vehicles.
Note the difference between an investment which guarantees to return your
money at a particular future date, such as a gilt or bond held to maturity,
and one which returns your money on demand, such as a traditional bank or
building society account. Gilts and bonds involve considerable market risk
while you hold them.
Always seek independent advice and check how the adviser is paid. If
commission-based, will the adviser still recommend nil-commission products
such as National Savings?
Should you be looking at income investments at all? Sophisticated investors
argue that income-seekers often would do better to aim for capital growth
instead. When they need income, they can simply cash in some profits to make
use of their tax-free Pounds 5,800 annual capital gains exemption.
Some investments offering good total returns but little or no true income,
such as zero coupon bonds, can be included in portfolios structured in a way
which allows them to provide a regular flow of profits as quasi-income.
But this approach will appeal only to investors who can afford to take a
long-term view, have a high risk tolerance, and are either unusually
numerate or have a very reliable financial adviser.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (The Caribbean): Colour-coded cruising - Blue is the
colour. Bahamas is the name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bahamas, apparently, are favourites with spacemen and satellite
photographers. They are thousands of emerald green islands, cays and
isolated rocks ribboned with bright white sand, scattered over hundreds of
square miles to the east of Florida, just across the Gulf Stream. But it is
the sea which makes the Bahamas so beautiful from above. Framed in the rich
royal blue of the deep ocean, the islands stand on sandy-bottomed banks, in
clear and shallow water, which shines with a vibrant turquoise glow.
There are about 15 main groups of islands, radiating around the central
island New Providence, the site of the capital Nassau, and linked to it by
mail boats and regular flights. The islands are all similar in appearance -
they are low-lying with pines that roar in the wind - but each group has a
distinctive feel.
The Abacos are an open crab-claw of islands in the north of the Bahamas. It
was less than an hour after touchdown at Marsh Harbour that I was sitting on
a boardwalk looking out on to a bight, taking in the last of the evening
light. Life has always centred on the sea in these barren islands (as the
name Marsh Harbour hints).
The old docks are still there, but now the bay is steadily encrusting with
brightly painted restaurants and bars which have the familiar, cheery feel
of Florida. Just a short hop from the US in a yacht, the Abacos are very
popular as a sailing destination. About half the marinas in the Bahamas are
situated there.
Many of the island groups have ribbons of cays standing a couple of miles
offshore. They enclose calm stretches of water ideal for sailing and so I
took a trip aboard a yacht, pausing at an isolated beach of brilliant white
coral sand and merciless sunshine. The Bahamian sea is impressive. With
currents on three sides of the archipelago, its waters are constantly
cleansed and they are strikingly clean.
From gin-clear shallows they recede through a colour chart of blues to a
turquoise that Magritte might have used. If school ever taught me why the
sea is blue, I could not remember the answer; certainly no one ever
explained how it could be that blue. The question began to tickle the
brainstem and so I took to asking people.
We put in to Hope Town, a perfect, pretty waterfront town. Pastel houses
were laid out beneath a proverbial pink candy lighthouse; it is as though it
was always destined to be a holiday town. The setting, gingerbread houses
standing behind white picket fences and festooned with bougainvillaea,
brings on a delicious holiday buzz.
Sitting on a waterfront deck with the waves lapping beneath me and tucking
into a lobster and lime butter I felt it all teetering on the brink of
cliche, but it was a good three hours before sunset. As for the colour of
the sea, my question did the rounds of the restaurant staff: the waitress
came back saying it was the reflection of the sky. Looking around, I decided
that somehow that might not be the complete story.
Nassau is the nerve centre of the Bahamas and if you travel between the
out-islands (or Family islands as they are known) you are quite likely to
put in there.
Nassau, Cable Beach and Paradise Island have been the heartland of Bahamian
tourism for 30 years, doing a brisk trade as the all-American rest-cure in
the sun; beaches, cabarets, casinos and shops, all just a short flight off
the coast of Florida. In a good year, more than 10 times as many tourists
pass through here as there are Bahamians altogether.
But travellers are beginning to venture beyond Nassau. I picture them as
migrating lobsters, which head off in groups of 50 and 60, nose to tail,
along the sea-floor. The Family islands are beginning to develop. And so I
flew off to the Exumas, to the south-east of the capital.
These islands announce themselves with the silver glint of a line of
breakers and then you run along them, a 100-mile string of sandbars and
spits of land set in a luxurious blue sea. Beneath the surface the currents
have left their mark, with ripples and swirls in the sand and deep cuts
between the islands.
Few of the Exuma Cays are inhabited. And if they are, civilisation is
nothing more than a hotel and a marina. At the foot of the chain we touched
down at Great Exuma, the largest island and site of the main settlement,
George Town.
The town stands on a magnificent harbour, protected from the Atlantic swells
by the usual line of cays a couple of miles offshore. The Tropic of Cancer
cuts through the bay.
The Exumas have a rawer, stronger West Indian quality than the more
developed islands to the north, and they are largely untouched as yet by the
pastel tourist revolution of waterfront bars. They are beginning to change,
but they offer a hint of the older Bahamas, still to be found further south,
on Rum Cay, Crooked Island-Acklins and the Inaguas).
Local rumshops are as much the source of entertainment as the waterfront
bars here.
An old commemorative photograph, yellowed even under the lamination, showed
George VI and the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in pinafore dresses. It
seems that patterns of human life in the Exumas are almost as timeless as
those of the waves.
There are places in the Bahamas where the sandy-bottomed flats stretch for
miles offshore - you can saunter off the beach, walking for miles in calf to
thigh-deep water. And it is for shallow flats like these that the Exumas are
famed because they are home to bonefish, which are known to be fearsome
fight-ers.
Flushed fishermen were telling ecstatic tales in the bar at the Peace and
Plenty Inn when I arrived. We got on to the colour of the sea and it was
decided that its intensity comes from the clear water and the white sand on
the sea floor.
I am not a fisherman, so instead the next day I took a Boston Whaler and
pottered around the harbour, still continually struck by the colour of the
water, nosing into isolated coves and eventually washing up on Stocking
Island, a classic, almost-desert-island, with just a couple of houses and a
beach bar. A large local lady was cooking up conch fritters.
We chatted about Exuma's curious barrage balloon, the 'Fat Albert', which
flies high above George Town. It is used to watch the traffic in the local
waters. Things have tightened up considerably in recent years as the South
American influence has come into play, but living so conveniently close to
the US, the seafaring Bahamian folk have traditionally been big smugglers.
Bimini used to be a favourite transhipment point. The two islands lie about
50 miles from downtown Miami, just a short ride across the Gulf Stream in a
power boat. 'Now, that a story,' the lady from Stocking island had said.
Whole suitcases of cocaine and Dollars 1,000 bills used to change hands
there.
But American visitors have been coming to Bimini since the 1930s for a
different reason. The island is the traditional haunt of deep-sea fishermen,
who have been trawling the depths of the Gulf Stream since the invention of
the outboard motor.
Hemingway and his strong-arm cronies were here, fishing for marlin by day
and fighting in the bars at night. I stopped over on the way out to Miami.
Bimini is an odd mix of the raw West Indies with its ragged, tin- roofed
houses, and the steady tourist gentrification. Top-heavy cruisers stand in
glinting lines in the marina.
Hemingway's brawls do not erupt much any more, and the most riotous
behaviour is usually the flailing of arms and legs on the dance floor. The
man himself has museum status nowadays; at the Compleat Angler Hotel you
will see his writings and pictures of him standing by 1,000lb monsters. He
would have been more at home with the smugglers than the tourists I guess,
so I wondered what he would have thought of it all.
I suppose I have missed the spaceman's promotion scheme by now, so I am
unlikely to see the Bahamas from the Shuttle, but you certainly get a fine
view of the Bahamas and all their glory from the window of a DASH 8. As for
why the sea is blue, that's one for the encyclopedia when I get home.
The Bahamas Tourist Office can be contacted on tel 071-629 5238 and
Bahamasair on 071-437 8766.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (Scotland): Forgotten romance of Scotland - Nicholas
Woodsworth makes a rewarding discovery on the road back to England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I drove into the Borders town of Kelso late one rainy night, feeling rather
low. I was London-bound and, after a week of wild hills and salt air in the
far north-west corner of Scotland, had little taste for a return to the
stuffy confines of English life.
If I stopped six miles short of the English border, it was not for nostalgic
reasons - it was simply because Kelso was a place to eat and sleep, a pit
stop as convenient as any on the way to the M1 motorway. The place had
nothing to do with the real Scotland which, as far as I was concerned, began
somewhere north of Inverness.
I woke early, though, and a look outside made me wonder immediately if I
might not take an extra day on the way down. The weather had cleared and,
just outside my hotel window, in warm morning sunlight, flowed a marvellous
river.
Twenty feet from the pasture on the far shore, a fisherman stood thigh-deep
in slow-moving water, spinning gossamer from a fly rod. Caught against the
light, the fishing line took on a twisting, restless life - the longer it
grew with each delicate flick of the rod, the more artful became its arcs,
the more complex its ellipses and convolutions. The fisherman's final object
might have been to catch fish but, in the process, he also caught me.
My eyes moved up-river, taking in new sights with new pleasure: a tall, blue
heron standing statue-like in shadows by the bank; a black and white border
collie, on some unknown but crucial mission, hurtling past a herd of fat
Guernseys drinking at the river; a large, water-borne swan stretching its
powerful neck skywards, wings flapping and chest heaving, before settling
back down to its customary repose.
My eyes finally came to rest on a far reach of river half a mile from the
town. Across a vast park dotted with shade trees, I spotted the crenellated
towers and pepper-pot chimneys of a sprawling castle. Somehow, although I
had never been in Kelso before, both river and castle seemed familiar.
The water that flows past Kelso is, in fact, the middle reach of the Tweed,
one of Scotland's most celebrated rivers; any angler who has ever picked up
a coffee-table book on salmon and trout fishing has seen pictures of it. The
memory of the castle was harder to locate.
Floors, Scotland's largest castle, was once featured graphically in
Greystoke, a film in which Tarzan of the apes returns from his jungle home
to claim his rightful inheritance as Scotland's distinguished Lord
Greystoke. That little conceit might seem somewhat improbable but, as I
began to discover immediately, it is no more improbable than our insistence
that highland Scotland is the only Scotland.
If romance is the criterion for Scottish travel - and, for most of us, it is
 -then we may be over-shooting the mark in our haste to make for lonely
northern islands and highland moors. In the superb and virtually ignored
countryside of the Borders, 500 years of violent struggle between Englishman
and Scot ensured there is more romance to the square yard than anywhere in
Britain.
Author Sir Walter Scott called Kelso 'the most beautiful, if not the most
romantic, town in Scotland'. He might have been prejudiced (he went to
school there) but, to get some idea of what he was talking about, I only had
to walk past Kelso's flower-strewn main square to the oldest part of town,
snugged into a sharp bend in the Tweed.
Once I had torn myself from the display cases of hand-tied flies in the
Tweedside Tackle shop - every bit as good as a visit to a fine arts museum -
I found myself in Abbey Row. In the grassy, tree-shaded square stood
hundreds of headstones, green with the moss of ages and leaning at all sorts
of precarious angles.
Anywhere else, a gloomy cemetery in the middle of town might seem morbid.
Here in the shadow of Kelso Abbey, it only substantiated the link between
present and past, enlivening the great medieval romance that bloody Borders'
history has now become.
In the middle ages, far from being the stage for wild and warring clans that
the highlands were, the Border area was a centre of monastic culture and
learning. In the first half of the 12th century, Scotland's King David I
embarked on a campaign of abbey-building so ambitious it left a string of
his successors bankrupt.
But the fate of those who followed the first monks at the four great royal
abbeys - Kelso, Dryburgh, Jedburgh and Melrose - was worse than any
indebtedness. Over the next five centuries, endless invasion and border
raids by the English, interspersed with counter-attacks and scorched earth
campaigns by the Scottish, engulfed the whole area.
Towns, castles, livestock and rich farming lands were not the only targets.
In 1544, after the town of Kelso had been burnt twice and gutted by the
English, the Earl of Hertford put these four abbeys to the torch.
By this time, 'the Kelso monks were mainly fighters', as one historian
recounts. 'Twelve monks and 90 laymen held the abbey against the English
and, when the guns battered down the splendid walls, the gallant
soldier-monks retreated to the tower, where they held out all night. At
dawn, the steeple was won and the last Scot died fighting.'
It is little wonder that, today, there are still significant differences of
outlook and behaviour, a sense of 'us and them', along the Scottish-English
border. I walked around the broken arches and collapsed towers and tried to
imagine the silent, smoking horror of Kelso Abbey following that last,
early-morning slaughter.
For a while, alone, it was easy. Then, in much less time than it took to
bring the abbey down, an entire church fete and bake-sale built itself up
around the ruins. I bought myself some treacly currant tart and wandered off
to Floors.
I enjoyed a tour with John Wilson, the castle's former butler turned guide
who now shows visitors about. It is a wonderful place, full of fairy-tale
castle ornamentation. 'Altogether a kingdom for Oberon and Titania to dwell
in,' Scott enthused.
Wilson did not wax quite as lyrical. 'Never used to like the stuff,' he told
me in the dining room, pointing out a magnificent set of engraved silver
gilt cutlery. 'Used to have to clean it.' Wilson is, in fact, tremendously
proud of Floors and tremendously knowledgeable about the Meissen porcelain,
Louis Quinze furniture, Aubusson carpets, Gobelin tapestries, Ming vases and
the hundreds of other objects that fill its rooms.
I enjoyed even more a chat with the duke of Roxburghe himself, an unassuming
man of great charm who, when not managing his 50,000 acres, likes nothing
more than fishing. We discussed farming life in the green, rounded hills of
the Borders and the proud, independent and tough attitude that is born from
it - Borders rugby men, he assured me, are second to none in Scotland.
We discussed Borders horsemanship - again, mostly because of the area's
warring tradition, unrivalled in the country. We discussed fox hunting,
pheasant shooting, hounds, cattle, cattle thieving, old Border traditions
and, inevitably, Sir Walter Scott. His former home in nearby Abbotsford, a
neo-Gothic mansion filled with all manner of things traditional, romantic
and heroic, attracts as many visitors as Floors.
Most of all, though, we discussed Tweed salmon and the monstrous specimen,
weighing more than 50lb and now mounted proudly on the wall, that the duke
pulled from the Tweed not so long ago. All in all, he concluded, there was
much more here to keep him occupied happily than there was in London.
I might have said the same. The pleasures to be found in the Borders are as
varied as you like to make them. Shortly afterwards, I found myself on a
rough tramp through the wild Cheviot hills with the merry members of the
Coldstream Ramblers Association.
On the other hand, dinner that evening at Sunlaws House, a grand baronial
hotel outside Kelso, was as elegant as could be: Perthshire venison with
figs, Tweed salmon with fennel, and Tayside raspberries with a great sigh of
satisfaction.
I had lost a day on the way down to London. The capital, I decided before
turning in, might just have to wait a day or two longer.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): TeleWest tries again - New issues
/ Christopher Price analyses the week's flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Flotation plans announced this week by TeleWest, the largest UK cable
operator, have provoked a mixed reaction from industry analysts and
commentators. They have also provided more fuel to the debate over the
multi-media revolution and the valuation investors should attach to it.
The move is TeleWest's second attempt to gain a listing; the group postponed
its original attempt in the summer, blaming poor market conditions. There is
little doubt that the market has improved since then, and the evidence from
recent issues such as Filtronic Comtek and Calluna is that investors are
willing to back new technology issues which rely more on future growth than
past performance.
But the fate of New Look, the fashion retailer, which postponed its float
last week due to lack of institutional investor demand, also showed that the
reaction to the high-profile disasters which have affected several new
issues in the market this year continues to sully sentiment.
TeleWest, a joint venture between US television and telecom groups TCI and
US West, will be the first UK cable company to be listed on the London
market. The company, which carries satellite television signals to around
133,000 homes and telephone services to more than half of these, intends to
encourage subscribers to take other services, such as fax and video.
Kleinwort Benson, TeleWest's broker, forecasts that the group's UK coverage
will rise from the present 613,000 homes to 2.4m in the year 2004, and that
its penetration rate will leap from 21 per cent to 47 per cent. This would
equate to more than 1m subscribers.
The broker anticipates that revenues will grow from Pounds 70m to Pounds
1.1bn in the same period and that the company will break even in 1998. It is
envisaged that the group becomes heavily cash-generative from the year 2000,
from which time a dividend could be paid.
Critics disagree and point to several potential clouds on TeleWest's
horizon. Prominent among these, they argue, is the so-called 'churn rate' -
the number of homes which have tried the cable service and not re-enlisted.
At 48.5 per cent during the year to end-September, some sceptics say this
proportion is too high.
There are also concerns about the valuation. Kleinwort says the rating is
undemanding when compared with the three other cable companies with UK
interests, which are listed in the US.
By using the level of capital spending, the number of connections and the
ratings applied to the US-listed companies, the broker has come up with a
value for TeleWest of Pounds 1.51bn before the money to be raised from the
offering. At the suggested share price of between 165p and 190p, the implied
value is between Pounds 1.25bn and Pounds 1.45bn.
TeleWest supporters believe the company deserves an even higher rating
because it has more control over its assets than some of the other cable
groups and because of the pedigree and resources of the parent companies.
The valuation figure is also reached by projecting the company's cash flows
in future years and calculating their net present value. This is done by
discounting the cash flows by the time value of money and adjusting for
risks specific to the company. For the year 2005, Kleinwort has chosen a
level of 10 times operating cash flow.
This is too high, say critics, who point to the large assumptions made in
the model. 'It is too sensitive to the discount rate, the multiple is too
demanding for a new issue, and there are too many 'ifs',' one analyst said
yesterday.
The aim of the float is to raise between Pounds 330m and Pounds 380m in new
money with the sale of 216m ordinary shares in London and the Nasdaq market
in New York. This represents 26 per cent of the enlarged issued ordinary
share capital - 22 per cent on a fully diluted basis. The share price will
be announced on November 22, with the company coming to market on November
30.
The global offer is being aimed largely at institutional shareholders,
although there is an intermediaries offer where up to a quarter of the 50
per cent of the offer reserved for non-US investors is being ear-marked for
London firms.
Interested private investors must go through a broker. For further details,
ring the information line on 071-490 5200. With BSkyB due to unveil its
flotation plans early next week, small investors looking for a multi-media
stake will await the details with interest.
Two other new issues of interest this week were Ashbourne Holdings, the
nursing home operator, and shellfish producer SeaPerfect.
Ashbourne shares, priced at 150p, values the group at Pounds 80.5m. This
will raise Pounds 48m after expenses through a placing and public offer to
pay off debt. SeaPerfect shares have been priced at 120p. It is coming to
market through a placing and intermediaries offer of 20.8m shares and the
issue will raise Pounds 25m.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buying at Everest Foods, noted last week, has continued.
The most recent transactions, by Christopher and John Fox Davies, came at
56p, the same as they paid previously. There has been no movement in the
share price.
The three directors buying at Country Casuals, the women's clothing
retailer, were taking the chance afforded them by the fall in the share
price after the announcement of interim results which reflected a fall from
pre-tax profit to loss.
The directors paid 84p; since then, the shares have rallied to over 90p.
Back in the spring, Richard Johnston, chief executive of Wyko Group, bought
120,000 shares at 45p.
Since then, the company has done well, outperforming the market by 26 per
cent over the past three months.
Now, chairman Philip White and Roger Edwards, a non-executive director, have
sold 400,000 shares each at 61.5p. Even so, their holdings still account for
almost 16 per cent of the group.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing for Growth): There's room at the
top - Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at problems with top performing trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main reason for investing in the stock market is to make as much money
as possible . . .
If you agree with this, you will be turning for guidance to Page 10 where we
list the top (and bottom) performing unit and investment trusts over various
periods. This will be a regular feature of the new Weekend Money section.
Yet, is a top-performing fund the one to choose if you want to make money?
The wealth warning on equity investment - 'past performance is not a guide
to future performance' - might seem tiresome but, broadly, it is true.
Indeed, there is an investment theory which says it is better to buy the
worst performing fund in a sector than the best. Johnson Fry's Worst
Performing fund operates on this principle by investing in the worst M&amp;G
life fund each year.
The reason some funds can fluctuate from top to bottom of the league tables
between one year and the next is that their performance tends to be related
to market conditions rather than their manager's skill.
This is why the winners - particularly over the whole unit or investment
trust sector - tend to be highly specialist trusts. A look at the top five
funds over the various periods shows that a large proportion are single
country funds, particularly those in the Far East.
The top performing unit trust over one year - Baring Korea - produced growth
of more than 50 per cent, but this performance cannot be divorced from the
30 per cent rise in the Korean market since the beginning of the year. It
also accounts for the presence of three Korea trusts in the top five
investment and unit trust tables over one year.
Those who favour 'bottom fishing' will not have been disappointed - at the
beginning of November 1993, Baring Korea was ranked 56 out of 57 in its
sector.
What goes up must come down, and it is Hong Kong which has been knocked off
its pedestal by Korea's performance. Gartmore Hong Kong, which heads the
five-year unit trust tables, is now ranked 58 out of 60 funds in the year to
November 1, losing 13p out of every Pounds 1 invested over the period. Once
again, the underperformance is linked to the local market, which has dropped
20 per cent since the beginning of the year.
A similar reversal of fortune was also evident in the UK equity growth
sector between 1992 and 1993. Many of the funds living at the bottom of the
league tables at the beginning of October 1992 were recovery or 'special
situation' funds which tend to invest in cyclical stocks.
One year later, recovery funds were at the top of the tables, their assets
boosted by the fall in interest rates after sterling left the exchange rate
mechanism in September 1992. So, the trick in making money in the stock
market is not only getting the timing right but doing so against a volatile
background. It is a high-risk strategy.
If you are a more cautious investor, seeking to protect and improve the real
value of your capital, you are better off steering well clear of the
high-flyers. Instead, you need to look for consistency.
Any realistic fund manager knows that to get into the top quartile (25 per
cent) of long-term league tables requires consistent above-average
performance. As time passes, the higher - but more volatile - performers
will drop out, propelling the above-average fund towards the top.
This is one reason why UK tracker funds - which aim to mirror the
performance of a benchmark index, often the FT-SE A All-Share - tend to
outperform other funds over time.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (The Caribbean): Face to face with the chop in
Jamaica - James Henderson feels the fever and intensity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something theatrical about the streets of Jamaica. Much of
Caribbean life takes place outdoors anyway, and all West Indians are
demonstrative and lively, but in Jamaica things are more feverish and
intense. The shouting and quipping and carrying on, and the timing of
course, can seem almost like drama.
The scene was the Parade in downtown Kingston, where I was heading to catch
a bus. I was weaving through the stalls of Ben Dung Plaza (so called because
you literally do have to 'ben dung' to select your purchase from the piles
neatly laid out on the ground).
Vendors were shouting: 'Nuts] Wrigleys] Nuts]'; and they soon picked up on
me: 'Hey white man] Come] Come]' said a huge brown woman with a head-tie and
her skirts rolled up above her knees.
Like all the stalls, hers was laid out with meticulous care, almost colour
co-ordinated, the red and green of cut water-melon and little pyramids of
limes. Once she had my attention, and that of all the people around, she
said: 'Come daalin'. Come squeeze me mangos . . .'
But if I had momentarily forgotten that I was catching a bus, the busmen had
not, and as soon as I strayed on to their turf the barrage began: 'Yes man,
this way man.'
Three of them vied for my custom. Before I knew it, I had been hustled on
board the nearest minibus, to a chorus of mock outrage from the other
conductors. My intended destination seemed only a secondary consideration.
The victorious busman seemed almost disappointed when I explained that I did
not want to go uptown after all, but across to the north coast. I needed a
different bus station altogether.
Three hours later I was in Ocho Rios, cosseted in old-colonial luxury in the
Jamaica Inn, which is a far cry from downtown Kingston. It is an enclave of
manicured calm, purposely old-fashioned, one of a number of places in
Jamaica that appeal to an era now largely passed.
The grounds, complete with a sumptuous croquet lawn, are worthy of an
English country garden, though of course the image is instantly spiked by
the palm trees. You can begin to feel the romance of the West Indies here.
A famed devotee of Jamaica was Noel Coward, who kept a house called Firefly
just outside Ocho Rios for many years until his death in 1973. It was chosen
with customary discernment because it has one of the Caribbean's finest
views.
Looking from the open-fronted drawing room, you see the Blue Mountains
recede in their camel-back ridges for 30 miles to one side and on the
shoreline beneath them the headlands outreach one another into the distance.
It is essential to travel around the island to get the best of Jamaica, and
it was soon time to set out again. Suddenly, outside the hotel grounds, the
harsh voices of everyday Jamaican life re-appeared.
People were talking to each other with the excitability and volume of
football fans whose team has just won an important match. Through a car
window they had all the gestures of pantomime. In the mayhem of the market,
people nosed their handcarts through the crowds, goats dragged their tethers
oblivious, conductors leant out of their buses, fistfuls of notes folded
between their fingers, shouting their destinations: 'Brongstong]
Brongstong]' (Browns Town), 'Maubyer] Maubyer]' (Mo Bay - short for Montego
Bay in patois).
I found a seat on the bus and the vendors walked up and down: 'Box drink,
box drink, bag juice, bag juice.' The aisle steadily filled up with people
standing. It is normal practice to hand your shopping to someone sitting if
you have to stand. I was given a satchel of books, my next door neighbour
got a baby.
I enjoy riding the buses, unlike many Jamaicans, who think of them as an
unreliable necessity rather than an adventure. Outside, the world flashed
by: groups of schoolchildren darted here and there, shorts and pinafore
dresses colour-coded according to their school; a small house stood between
two vast stacks of speakers, music audible even above the bus's stereo, a
single man danced; a woman walked with a single hand of bananas on her head;
a boy rode his bicycle at an impossibly uncomfortable angle, poised as
though he were about to perform some complicated BMX trick - but no, he just
switched to the other side in some odd expression of symmetry.
Of course Jamaica is well known for hustling and there's no doubt that it
can be hard on an unwary newcomer. Some lock themselves away in hotels and
do not step outside the compound except in a taxi, but if you do, sooner or
later (usually sooner because they will pick you out if you have no tan) you
will have a run-in with a hustler. It starts with a question impossible to
answer: 'So wha' 'appenin?' and a hand upturned in question.
Once they have you there they talk you through it, running down their
inventory of desirable and less desirable goods and services, anything from
primitive art, or yet another African carving, to an aloe massage. They are
persuasive, there is no doubt, and some make a good living: 'if you have de
lyric . . .'
I stepped out of the bus in Montego Bay and it began at once: everywhere
there was a chorus of 'So, whacannadoferyer?' 'Wha' 'appenin?' and of course
the eternal: 'Wanna taxi buddy?'
A man approached flourishing a machete and said, 'So, white man, I chop you
a nut, right,' (double take). He deftly topped a coconut and handed it to
me. 'Just 50 Jamaican.' After about 10 minutes of talk I handed over 20
Jamaican dollars.
One of my favourite Caribbean towns, Negril, lies at the western limit of
Jamaica. It was well known in the 1960s when the hippies washed up here and
admired the sunset a lot.
With all the recent building it has become a little gentrified (it even has
a golf course now) but it still has a laid-back air.
And here things took a turn for the absurd. Flushed, I saw a hustler arrive
by canoe, briefcase in hand and dressed in a suit, trousers rolled up
against the waves. He struck a pose on the shore and stumbled through the
sand on his business.
By all accounts not many Jamaicans go out jogging: 'Well man, you know, it a
long way . . . an' it HOT]' And so as I was stretching my legs, heading out
of Negril at a jog, people stopped and stared, or looked up from their
dominoes, bemused.
One man shouted after me with unlikely urgency as I left the town limits:
'You cyaan go out there, man, you are go get chop' (momentary thoughts of a
coconut). A six year-old squeaked with excitement at the sight of me: 'Look,
look, white man runnin]' and followed on for 100 yards.
Further on, an old man summed it up with a dismissive wave and just three
words: 'Get a taxi.'
As the largest and most vibrant of the British Caribbean islands, Jamaica
has the greatest romantic allure. Local life is that much more pressurised,
but the calm is correspondingly more of a relief. It is easy to feel the
love affair beginning.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): M&amp;S makes haste slowly - Company
in the news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Marks and Spencer expect good steady progress - and that is
exactly what the UK's most profitable retailer delivered this week.
Perhaps expectations are always a little too high, for the share price once
again shed a few pence following the announcement of the interim results on
Tuesday. Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to October 1 rose 15 per cent to
Pounds 354m on the back of a 7 per cent sales increase to Pounds 3.07bn.
This was, by any standards, a strong performance in a competitive market
where consumers are proving extremely cautious - perhaps taking their cue
from the group itself.
For caution is a key ingredient in the M&amp;S approach to business, even when
its expansion plans are accelerating. Capital spending is being lifted to a
record Pounds 400m this year and is likely to be more than Pounds 1bn over
three years.
Sir Richard Greenbury, the chairman who has been with the group since he was
16, cites the parable of the tortoise and the hare while explaining how M&amp;S
is increasing its presence in Europe and the Far East. 'It's a marathon not
a sprint,' he insists.
The group now has only 25 stores on the continent of Europe, but it is
investigating around 50 further sites in France, the Netherlands and Spain.
Interim operating profits in Europe were down from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 5m
after charging Pounds 3.8m for the opening of new stores. But sales
increased from Pounds 134.5m to Pounds 152.3m, and further gains are
expected following the introduction of the Outstanding Value Campaign. The
campaign, run in the UK for the past couple of years, passes on to customers
cost savings made through improvements in efficiency and information
technology without damaging operating margins.
Sir Richard said that, since the end of the half, sales had grown by about
20 per cent. There were signs of France and Spain coming out of recession
and, if the increase could be maintained, the second half would benefit
strongly.
In contrast to Europe, the Far East showed a good rise in operating profits
from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 8m, while sales were up from Pounds 23.2m to
Pounds 32.1m. The half-dozen M&amp;S stores in Hong Kong are considered to be
the most profitable in the group. Meanwhile, a management team is in Japan
looking at the possibility of opening stores there - but, again, the
watchword is caution.
Back home the room for expansion is more limited. While there are not many
high streets or out-of-town shopping centres where the group is not already
represented, it is continuing to extend its selling space. This year, about
500,000 sq ft is to be added, mostly in town and city centres, to bring the
total UK space to 11.1m sq ft.
Sir Richard described progress last year as 'substantial'. UK sales improved
to Pounds 2.52bn from Pounds 2.37bn, yielding operating profits of Pounds
343m, up from a previous Pounds 297m.
The group continued to win market share in clothing, where sales improved by
8.9 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, and food sales were ahead by 3.9 per cent to
Pounds 1.1bn. The black spot was home furnishing, where sales were down by
almost 1 per cent.
But forecast profits of around Pounds 950m for the full year leave the
shares at a premium of 25 per cent to the market.
While some criticisms can be levelled at the group - it does not, for
example, provide like-for-like sales figures - its track record is
impressive, and it is certain to remain a core holding.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): BAA - Pick of Lex / A selection
of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Refurbishing airport terminals may bring long-term benefits but, as BAA
admitted, such improvements have a short-term price. Growth in retail
spending per passenger in the first six months of the current financial year
was limited to just 1.8 per cent compared with the first half of last year
because shopping facilities were being rebuilt. Brokers who already knew
that passenger numbers had climbed 7 per cent had expected to upgrade their
profits' forecasts. The disappointing spending figures prompted an initial
fall of nearly 5 per cent in the share price, partly recouped later.
Nevertheless, BAA is certain to benefit from the growth in civil aviation.
The Channel tunnel may have some impact on passenger volumes next year but,
in the worst case, damage should be limited to the equivalent of six months'
growth. Meanwhile, spending per passenger should rise once the terminal
improvements are completed. At Heathrow terminals three and four, where work
is completed, retail income per passenger has improved 21 per cent and 83
per cent respectively.
With operating costs firmly under control, up just 3.5 per cent year on
year, BAA is well managed. But with a price-earnings ratio for the current
year of over 19, its shares trade at a 30 per cent premium. Given that
earnings grew 12 per cent in the first half, such a premium may look
expensive compared with other premium rated groups such as Reuter. But what
BAA lacks in growth, it makes up in predictability. With its monopoly
position and increasingly lenient regulatory regime, there is little to
knock it off its steady upward path.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): BA - Pick of Lex / A selection of
comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BA's second-quarter figures were so good that, for a moment, the market
could almost forget the continuing headache that is USAir. BA's stern cost
control was again in evidence and the strong growth in business traffic
brought a healthy increase in overall passenger yields. Year on year growth
is bound to slow now, if only because the business traffic recovery started
in the third quarter of BA's last financial year. But BA still has plenty of
momentum behind it.
It is the size of the final bill for BA's international expansion that is
the worry. Losses from France and Germany were unchanged in the first half
as the flag carriers attacked BA's Trojan horses. But it is USAir which is
the immediate concern. The Dollars 500m of cost reductions being asked of
the unions would barely offset its current losses and, as the negotiations
grind on, its low-cost rivals are leaving it further behind. The real fear
is not that BA will have to write off the Pounds 260m value of its stake,
which it could handle comfortably. It is that USAir will slowly die,
threatening the Pounds 70m of benefit BA expects this year, or that BA will
feel compelled to pour in more money to keep it alive.
The loss of Pounds 8m in preference dividends will be the only pain BA will
suffer from USAir in the current year, which should see group profits jump
by over 40 per cent to around Pounds 430m. With the shares trading on about
11.5 times prospective earnings, it is hard to argue that they are
expensive. But until there is better news from USAir, they are likely to
remain grounded.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Shell - Pick of Lex / A selection
of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell's rock-solid balance sheet, which includes Pounds 7.8bn in cash and
securities, made the Anglo-Dutch company a safe haven during recession. But
the company's financial strength makes it less attractive for investors at
this stage of the cycle. Shell is under-geared compared with its rivals, so
an equivalent rise in operating profits would have less of an impact on
earnings.
The operational benefits of recovery are also less marked. The group avoided
the sort of crisis that forced BP to cut staff by 35 per cent in just three
years. Without such problems, Shell has found cost-cutting harder to
implement. That was apparent in Thursday's results. For the three months to
September, Shell's replacement cost operating profits, excluding one-off
items, increased quarter on quarter by just 14 per cent. Most oil majors
posted results up between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.
Shell's lack of financial and operating gearing does not necessarily mean
investors should switch into BP. Both Shell and its UK rival are near record
highs. Shell, with a prospective price earnings ratio for 1995 of 15, and BP
at 13.4, are both at slight premiums to the market. That is unusual for oil
companies which, traditionally, grow more slowly than the economy. The
groups' yields offer no great incentive either. BP has outperformed the
market by 25 per cent since April and Shell by 10 per cent. That is enough
for now.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Insurance on the crest - Pick of
Lex / A selection of comments from this week's FT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter profits from Commercial Union and Royal Insurance demonstrate
that the UK insurance sector is still riding on the crest of a cyclical
wave. But, from here on, it is likely to be a gentle slide to the next
earnings trough. The magnitude of the bounce in profits merely serves to
highlight the sector's incorrigible cyclicality.
The niceties of insurance accounting ensure that the slowdown in earnings
from current levels will be gradual. However, rates in the key domestic
motor and household markets - which account for nearly the lion's share of
Royal's underwriting profits - have already slipped. They will slip further
as the onslaught from low-cost 'direct' insurers continues. Also set to
deteriorate is the ratio of claims paid to premium income: the recent
improvement does not look sustainable.
There are plus points. For example, insurers seem willing to forgo market
share in motors rather than pursue new business at uneconomic rates. They
are also maintaining pressure on costs, as highlighted by Royal's plans to
cut its UK workforce by 10 per cent over the next three years. But, overall,
the medium-term outlook for the UK industry is far from bright.
The outlook for the shares is, however, less dependent on the UK insurance
cycle - or the management's effort to diversify out of it - than the state
of world financial markets. Insurers' investment income is highly geared to
the market, and a reversal of the recent sharp underperformance of the
sector is likely to come only with a pronounced equity market rally.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): British Steel forges on - The
week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: British Steel's interim pre-tax profits are thought to have leapt to
between Pounds 130m and Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 27m a year ago.
The company, which dominates the UK steel market, is benefiting from price
increases, supply shortages and better demand as the UK manufacturing sector
recovers from recession.
TUESDAY: Full-year pre-tax profits from industrial gases company BOC are
estimated at about Pounds 260m, down sharply on last year thanks to an
Pounds 85m restructuring provision. Interest will centre on underlying
growth in the health-care business, which has been hit by the US expiry of
the patent on the anaesthetic gas Forane, and on how much BOC has benefited
from the wider upturn in chemicals sales and prices.
TUESDAY: Results for the first nine months of 1994 from General Accident,
the composite insurer, are expected to show pre-tax profits of about Pounds
330m, against Pounds 206m last time, highlighting the buoyancy of the UK
insurance sector.
Attention could focus on the group's assessment of likely trends in premium
rates, which will influence future profitability.
TUESDAY: Insurance broker Sedgwick is expected to report an increase in
pre-tax profits to about Pounds 75m from Pounds 64m in the first nine months
of 1993.
TUESDAY/THURSDAY: The stock market will be anxious for signals that rents
are rising and occupiers are taking additional space when Great Portland
Estates and Land Securities - which together make up almost one-third of
quoted property sector, report interim results.
Neither company revalues its property portfolio at the half-year stage but,
for property values to increase in the long term, it is necessary for rents
to rise. Unless investors see signs of stronger demand for business space,
property shares will remain in the doldrums.
Great Portland, which cut its dividend in June for the first time in its
35-year history, is expected to show a marked improvement over last year's
Pounds 40m rental income when it announces interim figures on Tuesday.
Analysts expect pre-tax profit of around Pounds 17.6m, against Pounds 16m.
As the UK's largest quoted property company, Land Securities' figures on
Thursday will be especially important for sentiment. In the first half of
last year, the company reported rental income of Pounds 192m and pre-tax
profits of Pounds 118.9m, including a contribution from sales of investment
property. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 118m this
time.
TUESDAY/THURSDAY: The two main electricity generators in England and Wales
report next week amid expectations that they will provide generous dividend
increases to shareholders. Analysts believe that both PowerGen, which
reports on Tuesday, and National Power, which reports on Thursday, are
capable of lifting pay-outs by at least 16 per cent. Some have pencilled in
more than 20 per cent. The results are the last before the government sells
off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the companies in February.
WEDNESDAY: British Gas's third-quarter results usually show a loss for the
quarter, which covers the months of lowest demand. Analysts expect losses in
the range of Pounds 200m-240m. The results coincide with the Queen's Speech,
in which the government is expected to announce new legislation to break up
 -in 1998 - British Gas's monopoly over 18m residential customers.
WEDNESDAY: Vosper Thornycroft, the Southampton-based shipbuilding and
engineering group, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of just
over Pounds 10m, compared with Pounds 9.08m last time. Analysts will seek
news of a possible Kuwaiti contract to build up to eight fast patrol boats.
The order was reported recently to have gone to CMN of France, but the UK
group is not giving up until the deal has been signed definitely.
WEDNESDAY: Unigate, the food and distribution group, is expected to report
flat interim profits of around Pounds 50m following tough trading in the
grocery sector and deregulation of the milk market. This month, the group,
which delivers milk to 1.6m households in south and south-west England,
raised its prices by 2p a pint to 40p.
THURSDAY: Whitbread opens the brewers' reporting season with interims that
should benefit from good summer weather, particularly in the south of
England where it is strongest. But pressure remains on beer margins and it
will also be affected by the lack of dividends from the Whitbread Investment
Company, which has been wound up. Pre-tax profits of around Pounds 138m,
against Pounds 132.3, are forecast.
THURSDAY: FKI, the electrical engineering group, is expected to report
interims of about Pounds 30m, compared with Pounds 22m last time. Having
abandoned a Pounds 400m US purchase in May because of the fall in London
share prices, the Halifax-based company will be quizzed about its
acquisition intentions.
THURSDAY: Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, is expected to show a fall
in pre-tax profits for the first nine months to about Pounds 55m, down from
Pounds 70m last time, largely because of problems in the US.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Defence giants bicker - Bids /
Bernard Gray looks at the battle for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tug-of-love struggle between GEC and BAe turned a little petulant this
week as the latter attacked the former's record in shipbuilding. Leaked BAe
briefing papers showed that GEC's Yarrow yard on Clydeside ranked only 25th
in the world league for exporting warships.
Many view the fight for VSEL as a proxy for the main battle for dominance in
UK defence between BAe and GEC. This week, though, it emerged the bidders
had agreed, in a confidential transaction 15 months, ago not to make any
aggressive move against one another until July 1995.
The Office of Fair Trading, meanwhile, announced it was extending the
deadline for its recommendations on referring the BAe bid to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission to December 7. That will be the next big highlight in
the battle.
If both bids are referred, the process will be stalled for six months. If
GEC is referred and BAe is not, BAe's all-share offer would probably win. If
neither is referred, the issue will be fought out in the stock market during
December.
BAe's offer of 2.747 of its shares for each VSEL share is worth Pounds 12.66
a VSEL share at present. GEC's offer is for Pounds 14 in cash. If neither
bid is referred, analysts expect BAe to increase its offer, and GEC might
follow.
GEC's shares finished the week down 4 1/2 p at 283p; BAe was up 4p at 461p
and VSEL was up 5p at 1373p.
There is one other wrinkle which could affect the end-game. About 150
shareholders attended a VSEL extraordinary general meeting on Wednesday to
change the company's articles to allow a BAe takeover. A similar meeting on
GEC's bid is due on November 24.
At the meeting, it was explained that neither contender could buy more than
15 per cent of VSEL in the market until a majority of shareholders had
accepted one bid. That prevents GEC increasing its 15 per cent holding and
could be important when the shells start to fly next month.
Meanwhile, Attwoods finished the week with a flourish, promising
shareholders it would put itself up for auction if they rejected the hostile
Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US, writes Peggy
Hollinger.
Yesterday's announcement made clear that this bid is not about the
independence of a company which has, in recent years, seriously disappointed
its shareholders. As one of Attwoods' advisers said yesterday: 'It is all
about value.'
BFI is offering 109p a share and 85p per preference share. Already, it has
secured the agreement of Attwoods' largest shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada,
which owns 29.8 per cent.
That agreement has severely restricted Attwoods' room for manoeuvre. If
independent shareholders reject BFI's offer, with no other alternative in
sight, then Laidlaw's open anxiety to sell the stake is certain to
overshadow the share price.
Given that overhang and its own track record, Attwoods has decided to push
the value argument by re-valuing its UK assets upwards by Pounds 30m,
publishing improved first-quarter profits, and promising investors a higher
return from a break-up. Now, shareholders must decide if the disposal
proposals represent a real alternative to BFI's offer.
BFI, for its part will have to decide before Friday whether to raise its
bid. The fact that Attwoods' shares are trading above the offer - they
closed last night 1p up at 115p - means the market is still expecting a
revised offer. Shareholders have plenty of time before they have to make up
their minds: final acceptances are not due until December 2.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Travel (The Caribean): Transported by the salsa rhythm -
James Henderson is overwhelmed by the power of music in the Caribbean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I groaned as I was told to 'hold'. I was on the telephone to a Caribbean
travel company, hassled, trying to get myself organised. But a moment later
there was Latin music on the line: a shuffling double beat of salsa and
sharp blasts of brass, that mesmeric, irresistible rhythm.
My mood lightened immediately and the memories surged: a warm tropical
night, dancers swaying left and right, a dance frenzy on the way. I felt my
legs move involuntarily, as though possessed of times past, and a feverish
flush tingled in my limbs. I was tempted just to drop the phone and head
straight to the airport.
There is surely nothing like the power of music to reinforce a sense of
place. The sights of a Caribbean visit - an airburst of palm-fronds etched
on a sunset, or a veranda view over distant islands - and the feelings - the
relaxing warmth and atmosphere of abandon - become intimately entwined with
island rhythms.
It could be salsa, or the lilting sound of steel drums or a heavy rumble of
reggae. Hear them again when you return home and they transport you.
It would be a bit of an exaggeration to say that there is a different rhythm
on every Caribbean island, but it is not far wrong. The island chain
reverberates from end to end with the thundering sounds of soca (Trinidadian
soul-calypso) and reggae (from Jamaica); in between there is a harmonic if
you like, in zouk, the music of the French Caribbean islands of Martinique
and Guadeloupe.
Then there are the Latin islands, where you will hear merengue in the
Dominican Republic, and the different versions of salsa from Cuba and Puerto
Rico. And this is not to consider all the rhythms now past: ska, the mazurka
and the beguine, rumba and cha-cha-cha.
Music is certainly an important part of Caribbean life. West Indians love to
dance, and of course their sense of rhythm is legendary.
In the Dominican Republic, the relatively large Latin country which shares
an island with Haiti, it seems that entertainment is the largest sector of
the economy. There are bars and restaurants everywhere.
Each night the main drag, the Malecon in Santo Domingo, buzzes with
thousands and thousands of people taking the evening air. On the main
shopping street I saw a man summon all his macho verve (a deep intake of
breath), stamp his heel and strike a matador's pose, and then lunge at a
hapless woman on an afternoon's browsing, carrying her off down the street
in time to the music played by one of the stores.
On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights the Dominicans pack the clubs and bars
to bursting. In Samana on the north coast it seemed that most of the town
was out dancing.
Caribbean dancing is all lower carriage movement. The waist stays almost
still and the hips and legs sway and shuffle. The Dominican merengue, which
has a distinct left-right, left-right step, is almost a march with wayward
hips. Couples hold each other close in a waltz, moving forward and back and
turning, their legs interlocking in a subtle game of advance and retreat,
never quite touching. When it gets going, it can be as arousing as a
striptease.
I was really out of my league, though. As the novelty of the evening (a
gringo on the dance-floor) I was treated with indulgence, and it is always
fun to be carried along in a crowd who dance well. You can fall into the
rhythm and forget yourself.
But as I became bolder, so I became a liability. There was no sensual
quality to my movement; instead I was in danger of giving someone a dead
leg. I gave up entirely when I saw a six-year old girl standing on the edge
of the dance floor. Her rhythm was perfect. Such grace in tiny, dumpy limbs.
Music has always been important. For the slaves on the cane plantations it
offered an escape from the miserable routine and a way of keeping alive a
connection with their African past.
Pure West African rhythms can still be heard in the drum-driven ceremonies
of voodoo and santeria throughout the Caribbean and South America.
Best of all though, go to a carnival, where you will see the explosive joy
of Caribbean music and dance given full vent.
The biggest Caribbean carnival is Trinidad's, which starts soon after
Christmas and culminates on the weekend before Lent. There can be more than
3,000 'players' in a carnival 'band'.
Hundreds of thousands of people join in the dancing and the national
airline, BWIA, has even been known to make a wingtip salute over the
revellers.
The idea of the 'farewell to meat', or any Lenten austerity for that matter,
is a nonsense in a place as fertile as the Caribbean, and true to form, the
West Indians have made it yet another excuse for a massive blow-out.
The main events begin on the Friday night before Lent. The Kings and Queens
of the Bands, the centrepieces of the Carnival bands, are displayed and the
Calypsonians (national figures with the status of singer, gossip and
political commentator rolled into one) compete with one another in song,
vying for the coveted title of Calypso Monarch. And then there are the
finals of the steel band competition.
West Indians will tune up almost anything to make music - over the years
they have used bamboo poles, biscuit tins, bottles, wheel hubs, cheese
graters and even garden forks in their parades.
But surely their most inventive creation is the steel pan. Steel drums,
which were invented in Trinidad, are made from discarded oil barrels (a 50
gallon oil-drum bashed out, tempered and tuned).
Watching a steel band is extraordinary. It is entirely percussive so there
is a visible energy as 50 or 60 people lunge and shift in unison, harnessing
a disparate medley of plinks, clangs and bongs into a coherent tune. The
sound can be a raucous metallic clangour or it can be as soft as velvet. It
can move you to tears.
Nobody goes to bed on Sunday night. They stay up and dance and then at dawn
they spill on to the streets for Jouvert (from Jour Ouvert). They cover
themselves in mud, paint, axle-grease, even chocolate sauce and they move
along in an ecstatic mass, so thick that the ground seems to shake in time.
This is the explosive essence of carnival, and it is driven by music from
bandwagons, articulated lorries stacked 30ft high with speakers. The noise
is deafening.
The lorries blast out the carnival tunes, for 20 minutes at a time, over and
over again. They etch themselves on to your mind.
At 10am, the players go home to change into their costumes for the main
carnival parade. They dance in their bands for the rest of the day, in the
height of the tropical heat. Some are dressed in elaborate costumes, as
centurians, revolutionaries and courtiers, some in nothing more than a
body-stocking and boots.
Unlike at other carnivals, Trinidadians do not dance in formation. Instead
they move as the mood takes them, with maximum room for self-expression -
warlike, sometimes humorous, ever-exuberant and often overtly sexual.
Next day, Mardi Gras, they get up and do it all again, from 9am until dusk,
snaking through the town so that the costumes and the bands can be judged.
That night, exhausted, dragging the remnants of their costumes, the
revellers stagger into a series of parties called Last Lap. And they
continue to dance.
At midnight on the dot, carnival stops.
It is possible to join a band at Trinidad Carnival. You can buy a costume
for Dollars 50-Dollars 100. Choose a band you would like to join - and then
beware of sunburn and heat exhaustion.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Welcome to Soviet Belgium - Emma Tucker only
wanted to register her car. But she had not reckoned with Brussels
bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the old Soviet Union, Zaire, or even Italy I would not have batted an
eyelid. But in Belgium? The centre of Europe, home to the institutions that
gave the EU the free movement of people?
Few know it until they get here, but Belgium lives and breathes bureaucracy.
Indeed, relocation to Europe's capital, even from another EU country, leaves
incoming foreigners bewildered, exhausted and sometimes in fits of enraged
tears.
Maddeningly, the EU's bedrock, the Treaty of Rome, can offer no relief.
Article 48 enshrines the freedom of movement of workers within the EU and
abolishes any discrimination based on nationality. But a treaty cannot
pronounce on bureaucracy, and since Belgians endure the same rigmarole as
foreigners, the country cannot be said to discriminate.
My first hurdle on arriving in Brussels in May was registering as a
journalist. The Belgian foreign ministry likes to keep a record of all
overseas journalists working in the country and rang, soon after I arrived,
telling me to turn up with my passport, two photos, and a press card from
home.
In a colourless, windowless room in the foreign ministry I completed the
required forms and after 10 minutes, was handed the laminated card.
Unfortunately the card lasted for only three months. To obtain full
accreditation I had to submit it to a panel of journalists who would
consider my application and decide whether or not I was a reputable
representative of the profession.
'Since you work for the Financial Times,' said the woman, 'there should not
be any problem.' But as none of my colleagues - not even the most fastidious
 -had completed the process, neither did I. I was already equipped with an
international press card from the British police and a press card from the
commission. But this was to prove to be a very big mistake.
The problems began when I bought a car. In order to get number plates, I had
to prove that I had registered with the authorities of my local 'commune'.
All foreigners are required to do this anyway. So on buying the car I went,
early one morning, to the town hall.
Having battled through the ranks of mothers with prams, frustrated
pensioners, and harassed immigrants, I was told I should have telephoned for
an appointment. 'Well, can I make it now please?' 'No, you have to
telephone.' The woman then pointed to a pay-phone in the corner of the room.
'You can use that one, but you must ring before 10am.'
When I finally got through, there were no appointments until August, two
months after I bought the car.
The commune then refused to give me a letter confirming that I lived in
Ixelles, my commune, so I had to apply for temporary number plates which
lasted only a month - another saga.
Meanwhile, before my August appointment, I was required to go to the local
police station with a copy of my rental agreement. When I rang for an
appointment, they told me the policeman who dealt with my street was ill. I
heard nothing more.
In August, when I turned up for the appointment at the commune, it had been
cancelled because I had not contacted the police. But my policeman was ill,
I protested. Tough. Another appointment was set for late September. By now,
my temporary number plates were well out of date.
This time I went to see the now recovered community policeman. He signed a
paper confirming that I lived at my address which I took, together with
passport, letter from the FT, photographs and details of my parents, back to
the town hall.
This time they refused to allow me to register because my Belgian press card
was out of date. Not only had I not been told that I would need to produce
this (what for example, do doctors or teachers produce?) but I had not heard
of other journalists having to do the same.
Of the many who work in Brussels, only a handful have bothered to get a
Belgian press card. But I was turned away with another appointment for late
November. Meanwhile, my number plates remain out of date, and a full press
card can, I am told, take up to six months to receive.
Why does a city which houses so many foreigners - about one-third of the
population of Brussels is foreign - make things so complicated. I rang the
Home Office in London and asked what a Belgian journalist arriving to work
in the UK would be expected to do. 'Show their passport at the airport,' was
the reply.
There is also a sinister side to Belgium's insistence that all its residents
register with the police.
Since the mid-1980s, certain Brussels communes have been allowed to refuse
to register non-EU foreign nationals. Predictably, this rule has been used
mainly to keep out Moroccan, African and Turkish immigrants. In one case, an
American who had bought a house in a central Brussels commune, was not
allowed to register his wife, who was of African origin.
According to the Human Rights League in Brussels, fighting to have the law
repealed, it has even prevented people who have lived in Belgium for 30
years from moving between communes.
While the rules for some are potentially devastating, for me they have been
merely irritating. In the six months since arriving I have not been able to
work out why they exist. If it is to create jobs, the Belgians would do
better to put their hundreds of bureaucrats to work on the capital's
pot-holed roads, or on clearing up the phenomenal quantity of dog's mess
from the streets.
Belgian officials say their system has developed - in the 160 years since
Belgium was created - out of bureaucratic systems borrowed from their
neighbours and the need to regulate a traditionally unruly population.
A government official said: 'For people coming from the UK and the US where
everything is free it is a culture shock. But the great pleasure of Belgian
people is to not respect the law.'
I do not enjoy exposing the absurdities of a country whose people have been
exceptionally welcoming. But it is consoling that all my Belgian friends
have urged me to do so.
That said, when it comes to equipping all citizens with an identity card,
the Belgians cannot understand my objections.
'But what would happen if you were in an accident?' they ask. 'How would the
police know who you were?'
This bureaucratic mentality prevails across most of the continent. In Italy,
for example, incoming EU citizens apply first for a temporary permit, after
which they can register with the commune. A colleague who moved from Belgium
to Italy said it was laborious - one visit to the local police involved a
three-hour wait - but less frustrating than his Belgian experiences.
In France, similar problems exist. 'To do anything in France,' said one
disgruntled expatriate, 'you need photocopies in triplicate of gas bills,
birth certificates and driving licences. And there is always something
missing.'
In Portugal, foreigners have to apply for a residents' card with the police,
but can only get one if equipped with a document from their embassy saying
that they are who they are. 'A passport is not good enough,' said a
Lisbon-based Briton.
Even in the Netherlands, foreign EU workers have to register with the
municipality, and after three months get a stamp of residence from the local
police.
A treaty against bureaucracy is what Europe needs.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: Of saints and sinners - Jimmy Burns went to
see the work of Mother Teresa's order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Hitchens may have surprised and shocked many Roman Catholics
with his attack on Mother Teresa in this week's Without Walls programme on
Channel Four, but it has not exactly come as a bolt from the blue.
In an article entitled 'Ghoul of Calcutta', published in the US's leading
left-wing magazine The Nation in April 1992, he referred to Mother Teresa as
a 'dangerous, sinister person who properly belongs in the caboose of the Pat
Buchanan baggage train'.
Hitchens' thesis then, as repeated this week, was that Mother Teresa's work
among India's poor, barely distinguishable from her public attacks on
contraception and abortion, was an exercise in Vatican-style Catholic and
right-wing propaganda masquerading as charity work.
In attacking Mother Teresa, Hitchens is not alone. As a former voluntary
worker in Calcutta wrote to the Guardian newspaper this week, there are
people who go to India and become disillusioned with the tea-and-sympathy
philosophy of Mother Teresa.
Last month I visited one of Mother Teresa's homes for abandoned children in
Delhi. One of the Sisters of Mercy explained why the majority of the
children there were either girls or handicapped boys.
Within the traditional Hindu family culture, a healthy boy is all that is
really longed for - a guarantor of support as well as inheritance. The boy
earns a wage and later lights the funeral pyre of his father. A girl is a
financial burden - for her dowry has to be paid by her parent.
Those that are born handicapped are regarded as a curse, spiritual outcasts,
best abandoned in the hope that better things may emerge from reincarnation.
I spent an afternoon playing with Michael, a mentally handicapped
four-year-old who drew chaotic lines across my note book before crunching up
the pages. He hardly smiled but as the afternoon wore on he gradually
abandoned his destruction and tried to draw me a flower instead.
I saw about 100 children there being cared for with extraordinary love by
the Sisters of Charity, a process that would continue until the day each and
everyone of them was adopted.
When I asked one of the nuns what guarantee there was that any of these
children would ever enjoy family life, one of the youngest among them woke
as if from a trance and said unflinchingly: 'Thank God there are more people
who want babies in the world than who do not want them.'
She added: 'We never ask for anything, and yet somehow we never lack
anything. Providence ensures that the most unexpected person turns up with a
most unexpected gift.'
I gave her some children's books and an envelope filled with money. Then I
left, thinking of my own two adopted daughters, seeking comfort in the
thought of them and yet, troubled by a sense of guilt at having to say
goodbye to Michael, pledged that my best contribution would be to write
about him.
Of course, I reflected afterwards, the young nun was in celestial
cloud-cuckoo land. One needs only to encounter the beggar children on the
streets of any urban centre in India to realise the consequences of
population growth.
And yet those same beggar children are testimony not so much to the impact
of Mother Teresa's proselytising but to the extent to which a combination of
political inertia - not to mention corrupt bureaucracy - and deep-rooted
cultural habits conspire against decent family life.
Mother Teresa's tasks result not from some hidden agenda within the Roman
Catholic church but from India's own failings as a nation. Until the day
that India has decent hospitals and redistributes wealth among the 40 per
cent of her population living beneath the poverty line, I find it difficult
to accept that Mother Teresa is a negative force rather than a liberating
one.
I recall the reaction of some medical staff to the plague which broke out
while I was in India. In Surat, the region where the outbreak began, a
doctor ran away to her village instead of attending to the first patients
that came to her for help.
In Delhi, a surgeon in one of the country's main general hospitals chased a
black rat from his operating theatre, caught it and put it in a plastic bag.
He took it to another hospital where a special emergency unit had been set
up to analyse blood samples of suspected plague carriers. When he got there
he was told to take the rat back to where he had taken it from because he
had acted without authorisation.
Neither the doctors nor Michael and the girls in Delhi featured in Hitchens'
programme. Maybe they should have done, if only to underline the fact that
the identification of saints and sinners cannot be two-dimensional.
Volunteers such as Mother Teresa work for the living in a land where too
many people are allowed to die.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Perspectives: The positive side of NO - The Nature of Things
/ Clive Cookson looks at a simple, unassuming little molecule that can both
kill and cure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some things are so small and unobtrusive that you fail to notice their
presence, even though they are doing useful work all around you. The most
striking example in science is nitric oxide - NO - which was regarded until
recently as a boring and insignificant little molecule but is now known to
be one of the most important of all natural chemicals.
Scientists used to think of NO just as a polluting gas emitted by power
stations and car exhausts. But over the past seven years they have
discovered that NO performs an astonishingly wide range of biological roles,
from laying down memories in the brain to controlling blood pressure, from
killing germs and cancer cells to preventing premature birth.
Indeed this simple molecule - one oxygen atom joined to one nitrogen - is
probably both the smallest of all biologically active substances and the
most diverse in its functions. This makes it rather embarrassing for science
that biological NO remained undiscovered for so long.
One reason is that for decades molecular biologists had been finding more
and more complexity in living systems. They were trained to look for large
organic molecules whose functions were determined by their shape - the
classic image is the chemical key fitting into a lock - and they did not
imagine that a simple inorganic gas such as NO could play such an important
role.
No one individual can take credit for revealing the significance of NO. This
has emerged from the convergence of research into several distinct
phenomena, including the expansion and contraction of blood vessels, cell
killing by the immune system, and chemical signalling in the brain.
NO was first proved to be produced by living systems in 1987, when
scientists at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Kent detected tiny
'puffs' of NO, given off by cells in the lining of blood vessels to make the
vessel walls contract.
Subsequent research has shown that NO plays a wide role in controlling blood
pressure and in maintaining the health of the heart and blood system. It is
also a general-purpose muscle relaxant in the body.
These observations cleared up several mysteries in pharmacology. One was the
action of the nitrate drugs used since the 19th century to treat angina. It
turns out that the nitrate breaks down in the body to release NO, which
dilates the arteries and allows more blood to reach the heart.
New applications for NO's muscle-relaxing powers are already emerging. One
is a nitrate-releasing skin patch which delays the onset of labour in women
who would otherwise give birth prematurely.
In the immune system, NO plays a quite different and far more aggressive
role. It is the long sought toxic agent released by macrophages - mobile
blood cells that kill invading germs and proliferating cancer cells.
Macrophages give off much larger puffs of NO than cells in blood vessels.
The process does not normally harm the human host because NO acts over a
very short range and dissipates rapidly, lasting no more than a few seconds
in the body. But it can kill someone who is overwhelmed with a bacterial
infection, releasing a huge excess of NO that reduces blood pressure to a
lethally low level. This is now believed to be the mechanism by which people
die of 'septic shock'.
Excessive release over a longer period may also cause trouble. Scientists
are beginning to blame NO for the damage inflicted by auto-immune diseases
such as diabetes.
NO's third main theatre of activity, in the brain and nervous system,
involves the smallest puffs of gas. Its role as a neurotransmitter - sending
chemical signals between nerve cells - is the most recently discovered and
is still far from being well understood.
Scientists believe, however, that NO plays an essential part in laying down
memory through 'long-term potentiation', a poorly characterised process by
which neural pathways change through repeated stimulation.
In the brain, as elsewhere, NO is a Jekyll-and-Hyde molecule. Under the
right conditions, it not only acts as an essential neurotransmitter but also
protects nerve cells against stress.
When things go wrong, NO poisons the brain. It is implicated in a wide range
of neurological disorders, including senile dementia, Parkinson's disease,
stroke and epilepsy.
NO research has not been going long enough for scientists to know what tilts
the balance between Jekyll and Hyde, let alone how to intervene in Dr
Jekyll's favour. It is not just a matter of a little NO being good and too
much being bad; other factors, such as the acidity of its surroundings,
affect the molecule's behaviour.
Now that NO's importance is universally acknowledged, thousands of
scientists are working on it. Academics are elucidating its fundamental
mechanisms of action while pharmaceutical researchers try to develop drugs,
either to deliver more NO to cells where there is too little or to inhibit
its formation where there is an excess.
Although some of the first drugs designed with a knowledge of NO are
beginning clinical trials, the timescales of the pharmaceutical industry
mean that they will not make a big impact on medicine for several years.
The immediate lesson of NO is that biologists should not be so obsessed with
interactions between complex and highly specialised molecules that they
ignore the work done by simple gases. NO may not be the only one with
unsuspected biological functions. Ethylene (CH) is a ripening hormone in
plants and may play a role in animals too. And there is recent evidence that
carbon monoxide (CO) acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain.
More generally, NO shows again how scientists can be so caught up by the
prevailing paradigm that they ignore important evidence that is, in
retrospect, obvious. In practice, though, there may be no other way for
science to proceed, without changing human nature.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Speculations): Lottery? You'd be safer at the
Halifax - Britain's new national flutter might be exciting but Raymond
Snoddy suggests there are better places for a rational person's money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The star-spangled hand of fortune in the television advertisements promoting
the launch of Britain's national lottery could well descend on a lucky
ticket-holder next Saturday night when the numbers are drawn for the first
time. But do not hold your breath.
The chances of winning an expected jackpot of Pounds 2m with a Pounds 1
ticket - if the jackpot is not rolled over until the following week because
no one has managed to chose the right six numbers - are around 14m to 1.
Your chances look rather better at roulette, where a bet on a colour has a
50-50 chance and the odds against winning on a single number are a mere 35
to one. But lotteries are in the business of selling dreams rather than
mathematical odds - a theme emphasised by the television commercials and
their slogan, 'It Could Be You.'
It is a dream that sells very effectively around the world. Last year, 165
lotteries - more than 100 playing computerised, on-line Lotto games like
that in the UK - had sales totalling Pounds 53.7bn. Camelot, the company
granted a licence to operate the UK version for the next seven years, hopes
to raise Pounds 32bn during that period, with up to Pounds 9bn going to such
'good causes' as the arts, charities, the national heritage, a millennium
fund and sport.
Overall, the lottery will be dispensing hundreds of thousands of prizes  -
most of them a minimum Pounds 10. But the odds against winning the jackpot
by choosing the correct six numbers (in any order) from the 49 balls in the
revolving drum actually are 14m:1.
Match five balls plus an extra bonus number and the odds fall to 2.3m:1 for
a Pounds 100,000 prize.
With five main numbers alone, the expected prize will be Pounds 1,500 and
the odds 55,000:1. Pick three correct numbers and there is the guaranteed
minimum prize of Pounds 10, with a 57:1 chance of winning.
By contrast, the Irish lottery works on six balls out of 42, with odds
against winning the twice-weekly IPounds 500,000 jackpot of 5.2m:1.
What happens to all the money? In the UK lottery, 50p of every Pounds 1
ticket goes in prizes, 12p in tax, 28p to good causes, 5p to the retailer
and the rest to Camelot for operator costs and profit. How does the UK
lottery compare with other ways of turning a small stake into millions
overnight?
The two most obvious options are buying premium bonds from National Savings
(NS) and playing the football pools. Both organisations, aware of the stiff
competition to be expected from the lottery, have changed their rules to
produce huge jackpot prizes.
Since April, NS has introduced a guaranteed monthly Pounds 1m winner. And,
although pools winnings are often shared, Littlewoods was able to announce a
record double pay-out this week when 10 London prison officers shared nearly
Pounds 1.8m and a couple from Lancashire won just over Pounds 900,000. This
followed the Pounds 2.6m shared by 12 regulars at a pub near Wigan,
Cheshire, last month.
It is, however, difficult to compare the lottery and premium bonds as
vehicles for high-odds gambling because they are such different things.
'Ours is a better gamble as a way of saving,' claims NS. This is because the
holder keeps his stake, gambles only with the interest, and has an automatic
entry in each monthly draw.
The odds against winning the Pounds 1m with a single ticket in the monthly
draws - Pounds 100 is now the minimum for premium bond sales - are very high
at 4bn:1. But such odds have not dampened bond sales: since the introduction
of the Pounds 1m top prize, sales have risen from Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m a
month last year to more than Pounds 200m a month now.
There is, however, a 15,000:1 chance of winning a prize each month, mainly
the Pounds 50 minimum. On average, someone holding 1,250 bonds can expect
one prize a year. Those with bonds worth Pounds 15,000 can look forward to
one prize a month.
Pools companies cannot quote odds on winning a big jackpot because there are
so many variables from week to week - such as the number of games and the
number of lines filled in. The odds against winning clearly are enormous -
around 18m:1, according to some estimates.
The level of prize money returned by the pools companies is unimpressive,
too. The government takes 37.5 per cent in tax and 10 per cent goes towards
the Football Trust and the Foundation For Sport. Only between 25 per cent
and 30 per cent of the stake is returned in prizes.
Thus, a wholly rational person probably would do well to stay away from
lotteries, pools and (to a lesser extent) premium bonds and find a safer
place for his money. Building societies, perhaps?
Other major lotteries include:
New York
One of the on-line games in the state lottery is called Take Five. This is a
5/39 lottery, meaning you must pick five out of 39 numbers correctly. The
odds of winning any prize are 8.77:1. The odds of winning the jackpot are
576,000:1. Rhode Island
One of Rhode Island's on-line games is called Powerball where players are
required to select five numbers from 1 to 45 and then a sixth number -
called the Powerball - from 1 to 45. Overall odds of winning a cash prize
are 35:1. The odds of winning the jackpot are 55,000:1.
Texas
The Texas on-line game, Texas Lotto is a 6/50 game. Therefore, the odds on
winning the jackpot are 15,890,700:1. There is a guaranteed minimum jackpot
of Dollars 2m.
South Dakota
Dakota Cash is a 5/35 cash lotto game where the overall odds of winning any
prize are 72:1. The odds on winning the jackpot are 325,000:1. The jackpot
starts at a minimum of Dollars 20,000 and rolls over until it has been won.
Georgia
Georgia Lotto, the state's main on-line game, is a 6/46 game. The odds are:
six out of six = 9.4m:1; five out of six = 39,000:1; four out of six =
801:1; three out of six = 47:1.
Fifty per cent of sales go in prizes.
Australia
Most of the Australian states - New South Wales, Queensland, South
Australia, Victoria and Western Australia - have 6/45 on-line lotteries.
The odds on winning the jackpot in these lotteries is 8.1m:1.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The night of the salesmen - David
Spark only wanted three new windows . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We decided to seek a couple of quotes for double-glazing as our 70-year-old
front windows let in the cold and dust. We thought the quotes should take
about half an hour each. So we arranged for one glassman to come at 7pm, the
other at 8.30pm, which would allow us to have supper in between.
We were mistaken. Our seminar in double-glazing lasted until 12.30 the next
morning.
We first got worried when Nath (not his real name), our 7pm visitor, did not
go straight to measure the windows. Armed with a lawyer's voluminous brief
case and a flipchart kit in black plastic, he made for the kitchen table,
returning from time to time to his car boot for more ammunition. We had to
have the full treatment, he said, in case we were inspectors.
He was a pleasantly spoken Asian from east Africa, with grey-tinged hair and
a smart grey suit, and he told us about his well-established employer,
Company A, still with the founders in charge and selling glazing that
bristled with locking bolts and British Standards. It was placed in its
steel-reinforced frames from the inside, which made it harder for a
housebreaker to remove. The white PVC frames would not go yellow, unlike
Company C's. Special glass on the inside reflected heat back into the room.
By this time it was 7.50pm, the potatoes were burning, and my wife was
worried about the ham and leeks au gratin.
Satisfied that he had said everything there was to say, and more, Nath
measured the three windows. Then he produced some tables which turned
measurements into quotes, allowing for the windows that had to open and the
fact that we wanted to match the style of the road.
The quote was around Pounds 7,500, and this was a special favour since it
should have been Pounds 8,000 - the price had gone up that day. However,
there were discounts which brought it down to Pounds 5,600. But we had to
decide there and then.
'Say you'll think it over,' said my son Ian, himself a salesman.
We said we would think it over.
Nath asked if he could ring his boss. That brought a further Pounds 280
discount. But we said we would get in touch.
Dave from Company B, subsidiary of a noted PLC, arrived just as Nath was
leaving. He was a bubbly east Londoner who had sold double glazing for 12
years, ever since he realised he was too short for professional goalkeeping.
He had sold glazing to himself and his grandmother. He married the wrong
woman first time round, or perhaps she did not like the hours he worked. He
had parted company with his gall bladder.
My wife went to eat her ham, leeks and scorched potatoes while I listened to
Dave's spiel. We now knew the form.
His flipchart was not as elegant as Nath's but his PVC, he said, stayed
whiter in the sunshine. It had this miracle ingredient, guaranteed for 10
years. Company A's windows might bristle with locking bolts but a thief
could knock them out with a Black and Decker drill.
His glass was put in from the outside and sealed with a tough beading.
Thieves could loosen inside-mounted glass by gouging out the rubber piping.
His windows had this special finish which repelled the dirt. He shook up
dirty water in a glass bottle to prove it.
After measuring, Dave kept his cards close to his chest. No showing of the
price list, just a quote of Pounds 8,000. But it was possible, he said, that
ours could be a showhouse. We would have a lot of points: a fair amount of
passing traffic, 400 yards from the tube station, shops and school, and a
house on which his glazing would look great. He would ring his boss. 'I bet
he's on commission only,' said Ian.
The phone call led him to furious pumping of figures into his calculator.
Eventually he said we could have Pounds 1,230 off if we let them take
before-and-after photographs. Displaying a small placard for four weeks was
worth Pounds 1,000, and letting him show four customers the house from the
outside another Pounds 1,000.
That brought it down to Pounds 4,770 but there was a snag. 'I have to add
VAT,' said Dave. That put him back up to Nath's price. We said we would
think it over and let him know.
'What would it take to get you to decide tonight?' he asked.
We refused to be drawn.
There might just be a bit of budget going, he said. He would ring the boss.
He came back with an offer of Pounds 4,450 including VAT and we decided to
take it. It was 11.30 and I went for my supper. I need not have rushed.
Form-filling took a further 45 minutes.
Nath, when I told him the bad news next day, was understandably miffed. 'You
rushed me,' he said, 'or I would have mentioned a showhouse.'
A few minutes later he rang back. 'Here's my last shot,' he said, 'Pounds
4,100.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / Minding Your Own Business: A long ride on a steam engine -
Four boys became captivated by an ironworks in the 1960s. Clive Fewins
visits the company they founded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Engineer David Hodgson will never forget the 45 long minutes he spent locked
in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery in west London. There were coffins
as far as he could see in every direction. His memory of the experience is
even more vivid because he had a bad cold at the time but had to suppress
all his sneezes. A service was in progress in the chapel directly above him
and he feared that some of the congregation might rapidly join the dead
below if they heard sneezes emerging from the depths.
Such a sound could easily have been heard, for in place of the hydraulic
catafalque that conveys coffins through the floor to their final resting
place there was a large void. The catafalque lay awaiting restoration in
Hodgson's workshop in the Derbyshire Dales and his task in the catacombs was
to examine the condition of the machinery that operates it. Cemetery
regulations dictated that he should be locked in the catacombs while
carrying out his work.
Hodgson runs the northern arm of Dorothea Restorations, a company that
specialises in engineering conservation work. Standing near the half tonne
catafalque structure in the Dorothea workshop at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire
are several other monoliths from Britain's industrial past. They include
Locomotion - a 20-year-old replica of the engine that pulled the first
passenger trains on the Stockton to Darlington railway, an 1838 steam engine
that used to haul baggage trains on the Liverpool to Manchester line and a
100-year-old industrial diesel engine undergoing an overhaul for its owner,
Hull City Museum.
Dorothea had its origins in Bolton in the mid-1960s when four 16-year-old
schoolmates found themselves captivated by the huge engines, steam hammers,
heat and flames from the country's last working wrought iron works.
'To us it was the most exhilarating atmosphere. In our lunch hours and after
school we got to know the men at Walmsley's iron works who used to let us
help them and even drive the steam engines,' said Hodgson, 45.
The four - the others were Roger Lees, Chris Topp and Ted McAvoy - all went
off to different universities, but kept in touch.
When they graduated three years later, they remained convinced that their
mission was to conserve and preserve parts of Britain's industrial and
architectural heritage that they saw fast disappearing. Three found jobs in
different parts of the country and pooled some of their wages to support
Lees, the only mechanical engineer of the four, who was starting up
Dorothea.
The name came from a huge slate quarry in north Wales. On their meanderings
the four had discovered a fine old Cornish beam engine there. Although it
had not worked for more than a decade the engine was still in reasonable
order and the management was happy to let the four work on it at weekends,
while Lees remained on site during the week.
The idea was that the engine should form a means of attracting visitors to
tour the quarry, which was suffering hard times.
But the quarry closed and a development company bought the site with the
intention of turning part of it into a holiday complex. One of the main
attractions was to be a small industrial museum centred around the steam
engine. That scheme fell through, but the experience left the four with
enough confidence to set up a company doing what they had always wanted to
do: restoring old machinery and engines.
With the aid of a Pounds 300 overdraft from Lloyds bank, Dorothea
Restoration Engineers came into being in 1974 after the four had gained
further experience at the infant Ironbridge Gorge Museum and the North of
England Industrial Museum at Beamish near Newcastle-on-Tyne. The four had no
base; they met and worked at whatever site or project was employing them at
the time.
The work mainly involved horizontal, mill and winding engines, but in 1975
they were joined by Geoff Wallis, a mechanical engineer whom they had met
working at Ironbridge. His origins were in Bristol and he rapidly
established a western base, concentrating on architectural restoration work
based on wrought and cast iron. The same year the others rented a former
candle-wick mill at Kettleshulme in Cheshire. It served as a cheap operating
base while business grew, especially from the clutch of industrial museums
that followed Ironbridge and Beamish.
By the time Dorothea established a third base - a rented blacksmith's
workshop in Buxton - there were 20 employees. In 1976 they extended the
overdraft to Pounds 2,000 and bought a workshop in Bristol for Pounds
25,000. The current 6,000 sq ft Bristol works was bought for Pounds 137,000
in 1987. It is responsible for 60 per cent of the turnover of just over
Pounds 1m and is the base of 12 of the 23 employees.
In the late 1970s Dorothea moved its northern base from Kettleshulme to a
rented 2,000 sq ft engineering works at Whaley Bridge, near Macclesfield. By
then the company had four sites and 70 employees, and turnover was about
Pounds 250,000. But it was all too much.
'Administration was a nightmare, we had chronic cash flow problems, and the
business was still run by a committee,' Hodgson said. 'We had left the
civilised world of museums for the harsh realities of the construction
industry, where we faced all the problems of the sub-contractor. But we had
always been self-financed and we were determined to stay that way.'
They succeeded. In 1980, Topp volunteered to leave - he remained a director
 -and to run the smithy as a separate business, working closely with
Dorothea when the occasion arose. This relieved the company of one of the
four sites and some of the pressure.
The four then appointed David Maiden, an architect who had joined them, as a
director and and gave him a free hand. He put Hodgson in charge of the works
at Whaley bridge, while McAvoy continued with the potentially very
profitable business of making reproduction cast iron street furniture at
Buxton.
'From being on the point of collapse we turned Dorothea round.
The exercise served us in good stead for the leaner years of the late 80s
and 90s,' Hodgson said.
In 1984 the company accepted an outside consultant's report, and the street
furniture and new architectural metalwork sections split away completely.
Topp, Maiden and McAvoy departed to be directors of the new company of
Dorothea Ltd, and eventually sold out to an engineering conglomerate.
Hodgson, Lees and Wallis became directors of Dorothea Restorations Ltd.
So it has remained. For the past 10 years, in spite of the vicissitudes of
the building trade and cutbacks in museum funding the northern and southern
works have combined to make a modest 2 per cent profit.
'It's never huge - but we survive,' said Hodgson. 'Amazingly we have always
stayed in profit. In recent years there have been no redundancies. The
keynote has been steadiness and gradual reinvestment - especially in staff.'
Later this year Dorothea is dipping its toes into continental Europe for the
first time; the company is attending a trade fair in Amsterdam. It is also
tendering for a number of prestigious jobs, including some replacement
ironwork for the Albert Memorial. Hodgson is hoping to be able to add this
to a string of jobs they have completed for clients such as The National
Trust, English Heritage, the Royal Botanic gardens at Kew and the Palace of
Westminster.
The four original Bolton schoolboys are still the best of friends. McAvoy
runs an aluminium fabrication company near Whaley Bridge and undertakes work
for Dorothea on occasions, as does blacksmith Topp.
'Its nice to think that after all these years and many ups and downs we are
still firm friends,' Hodgson said. 'We all like to think we were pioneers
back in the 60s of the industrial and architectural heritage conservation
movement, to which, in our own ways, we are all still highly committed.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): A honeymoon that lasted just three
hours - Wall Street / Reality quick to replace euphoria after Republicans'
landslide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the honeymoon between President Clinton and the new Republican-controlled
Congress lasted little more than 24 hours this week, any affectionate
thoughts the financial markets had about the Grand Old Party's mid-term
election triumphs on Tuesday had an even shorter shelf-life - about three
hours. That was how long it took for reality to set in on Wall Street after
the Republicans wrested control of both houses of Congress, plus a string of
state governorships, in an electoral landslide that left the Democratic
party and the president reeling.
The stock market's initial reaction to the elections was, unsurprisingly,
positive. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt almost 40 points in the
first hour of trading as traders and investors responded to the results in
typical knee-jerk fashion: the Republican party is the pro-business party,
and a Republican-run Congress will cut taxes to aid businesses and investors
and take tough action to reduce government spending, all of which is good
for stocks.
The warm glow surrounding the election results dissipated quickly, however,
as analysts and traders began to take a closer look at the Republicans who
would take over leadership of the key legislative committees on Capitol Hill
and their policies. This involved becoming acquainted with people such as
Bill Archer, the new chairman of the all-powerful House Ways and Means
committee, from where all US tax laws originate.
Archer, as he explained on Thursday, wants to push a host of tax cuts
through Congress and, ultimately, eliminate income taxes altogether. He, and
other Republicans who outlined their plans eagerly this week, also want to
increase defence spending significantly and pass a balanced budget amendment
to force the government to eliminate the federal deficit.
Unfortunately, few Republicans were willing to explain exactly where the
huge spending reductions required to offset the tax cuts would come from,
and how exactly they would balance the budget after spending billions more
on defence - a feat that the Reagan administration never mastered during the
1980s.
In the absence of any specific proposals on spending cuts, the markets were
left to worry about the repercussions of Republican policy on the budget
deficit, interest rates and the bond market. And none was particularly
pleasing: if Republican actions boosted the size of the deficit, the
government would have to borrow more money to finance it, which would
probably lead to higher interest rates.
It was this kind of thinking which prompted share prices to retreat from
their highs on Wednesday and continue retreating on Thursday.
Traders and investors were also troubled by suggestions that top Republican
congressmen might block measures to liberalise international trade under
Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade); and by the likelihood
that key banking and finance committees now under Republican control would
widen significantly investigations into the Whitewater affair, potentially
further weakening Clinton's position and undermining international investor
confidence in the US.
Above all, however, the markets were unsettled by the uncertainty
surrounding Tuesday's political earthquake which placed the Senate and the
House of Representatives in Republican hands for the first time in more than
40 years. While political pundits agreed universally that change on this
scale was unprecedented in modern US political history, no one could explain
convincingly what exactly it would mean for the immediate future. Would it
lead to more or less gridlock? A bigger or smaller deficit? Higher or lower
interest rates? A stronger or weaker economy?
Amid all the doubts and unanswered questions, however, Wall Street was able
to reassure itself with the thought that the one thing the Republicans did
not win control of this week was monetary policy, which remains in the
politically-independent hands of the Federal Reserve.
Unfortunately, those hands are poised to squeeze monetary policy a little
tighter next week when the Fed's open market committee meets to decide if it
needs to raise interest rates again to restrain inflationary pressures in
the economy. The markets are fully expecting the Fed to increase short-term
rates by half a percentage point, to 4 1/4 per cent. Although the most
recent economic data - an 0.5 per cent drop in October producer prices
reported on Thursday - indicated that inflation remained unthreatening, the
central bank appears determined to take every precautionary measure
necessary.
This sobering thought was, ultimately, behind the stock market's poor
performance this week. For all the excitement of Tuesday's election results,
traders and investors know that the most powerful figure in America this
week is not Bob Dole, the new Republican leader of the Senate, or Newt
Gingrich, the new Republican leader of the House - but Fed chairman Alan
Greenspan.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Political waves alter sentiment -
London / Utilities are in the firing line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British investors have become inured this autumn to having their hopes for
equities dampened by regular waves of pessimism from the US over further
interest rate rises. It came as an unusual diversion, therefore, for London
to be swept up in a tide of euphoria from Wall Street.
No matter that US traders' exultation over the rout suffered by the
Democrats on Tuesday quickly gave way to second thoughts about the
implications of legislative stalemate: a surge in strength by the dollar
helped inspire international bond and equity markets.
The transatlantic stimulus was sufficient to lift the FT-SE 100 by 35.8
points on Wednesday - reversing the market's 31.8 point fall on Monday, when
traders had continued to fret about the interest rate outlook amid very thin
trading. The market marked time on Tuesday and Thursday, but fell again on
Friday as traders once more focused on the increasing likelihood that US
interest rates would rise by at least half a percentage point next week.
Another douche of cold water for the UK market came from Gordon Brown, the
shadow chancellor, who said that a future Labour government would impose a
one-off tax on the 'excessive profits' of the privatised utility companies.
This threat depressed the share prices of the water companies, even although
Northumbrian Water Group took the lead in the industry's dividend bonanza
with a record 16 per cent increase.
The announcement by Northumbrian, smallest of the privatised companies,
followed better than expected pay-outs from Thames and Anglian, which
increased dividends by 11 and 10 per cent.
Brown also proposed imposing a windfall tax on the Pounds 3.5bn that will
accrue to the regional electricity companies with the coming flotation of
the National Grid. Scottish Power kicked off what is likely to be a
politically contentious interim results season by the regional electricity
companies, lifting its dividend 10.2 per cent. One analyst said the reaction
of shares to Brown's speech 'serves to remind investors of the political
risks attached to utility stocks'.
Not all privatised industries reported record results, though. Shares in
British Telecommunications slipped after the group said its interim profits
had been held back by the cost of cutting prices and jobs. The group took
redundancy charges of Pounds 151m and said staff numbers were now 151,600 -
a 4,400 reduction on the start of the year and on track for a reduction of
15,000 in the full year.
BT has reduced prices 11 times this year under the conditions of its pricing
formula and has already returned about Pounds 1bn to customers in the form
of price cuts, with a further Pounds 400m to be shaved in the present year.
These price cuts have increased pressure on its competitor, Mercury
Communications, a subsidiary of the telecommunications group Cable &amp;
Wireless. The group said overall profits were up but announced a substantial
cost and head-count reduction programme which, analysts suggested, could cut
up to 2,000 of Mercury's 11,400 jobs.
BT and Mercury are feeling these cost pressures in spite of vigorous growth
in the wider economy. The Central Statistical Office said industrial
production grew unexpectedly fast in the three months to September, and
upgraded its estimate of the present annual trend rate of growth for
production industry output to 6 per cent.
Increasing economic activity meant that BAA, the privatised airports group,
saw a 7 per cent increase in airline passenger traffic. But the group's
shares fell nearly 5 per cent after disappointment that the growth in retail
spending by passengers had been held back by building work at Heathrow.
British Airways managed to increase its interim pre-tax profits by 45 per
cent and said it was reaping the rewards of cost controls and a campaign to
win business travellers. In spite of flagging a possible write-down of its
Dollars 400m investment in the troubled USAir, BA said the outlook for the
full year was encouraging.
Another blue-chip stock to benefit from economic recovery was Marks and
Spencer, the food and clothing chain, which reported a 15 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits. Already established as the UK's most profitable
retailer, M&amp;S has lifted sales in continental Europe by 20 per cent since
exporting its Outstanding Value campaign from the UK.
These were impressive results, but investors were cautioned not to get
carried away by the retailing sector's potential. The stores team at
Flemings cited the importance to retailers of the coming pre-Christmas rush
(see chart below). They said the sector seemed to be influenced by this and
it often outperformed the market pre-Christmas. It almost always
under-performed between early December and the end of February.
Flemings said: 'We think the most likely explanation for this effect is that
investors tend to react positively to seeing the stores busy in the run-up
to Christmas, but do not have the quantitative input to provide the
necessary balance (if the queues at the till are five-deep this year, were
they four-deep or six-deep last year?) Quantitative measurement comes after
Christmas with company statements indicating how good or bad trading was
during the peak period. Rarely, it seems, are expectations exceeded]'
Finally, business came under fire from Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, who berated executives for not investing enough and
expecting too great and quick a return. He was addressing the annual
conference of the Confederation of British Industry whose president
acknowledged there was a case for companies re-examining their rates of
return.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Black gold from the Atlantic, who
benefits? - Oil / Robert Corzine reports on development plans for Foinaven,
the UK's first deep-sea field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new 'oil bonanza' was how some newspapers reported this week's
announcement that the government had given the go-ahead for British
Petroleum and partner Shell to develop Foinaven, the UK's first oilfield in
the deep waters west of the Shetland islands. But will this herald a new
British oil boom? And who is likely to benefit?
Foinaven, named after a Scottish mountain, lies in 1,300ft to 2,000ft of
water about 120 miles west of Shetland. Oil companies have long suspected
the area could have oil but interest in the area was limited until recently
because of the high risks and costs of operating in the open ocean.
The risks have been reduced by recent advances in seismic and production
technology. And companies, under pressure from relatively low oil prices,
have slashed their capital and operating costs over the past few years by as
much as 30 per cent. All this has made such frontier projects as Foinaven
more viable.
A study by 10 companies suggests the area, also known as the Atlantic
Frontier, could contain 3.5bn barrels of oil. Full development of the 11
possible fields identified so far would cost about Pounds 9.5bn between 1995
and 2010.
Government officials say full production from the area could represent about
a third of present North Sea output. That would make it a 'world class' oil
province, although well short of being a 'bonanza' of the type experienced
when North Sea oil was discovered.
Part of the reason for this is an industry perception that prices are likely
to stay relatively low for some years. With the benchmark Brent Blend
hovering between Dollars 15 to Dollars 18 a barrel, companies are reluctant
to start expansive capital spending projects with long pay-back periods.
The preference for projects with early production and equally early cash
flows contrasts sharply with the heyday of the North Sea when oil prices
were above Dollars 30 a barrel and there were forecasts that prices in the
1990s could reach Dollars 100 a barrel or more.
There will, however, be some beneficiaries of even a mini-boom. These
include the drilling contractors which own the 30 or so rigs in the world
capable of operating with safety in such deep and turbulent water.
Then, too, there are the specialised engineering companies which make the
complex sub-sea wells that sit on the ocean floor and are connected by
flexible pipes to production and storage ships on the surface.
The jobs outlook is not quite so optimistic. Although some new ones may be
created in the mainly Scottish-based offshore support industry, it is more
likely that existing jobs will be secured.
As for the companies, BP is clearly the biggest beneficiary so far - and its
risk-taking is likely to be rewarded by the government in the form of new
exploration licences in the area.
But others which are active west of Shetland include Amerada Hess, a US
concern which has expanded rapidly in the UK in recent years, Texaco, Total,
Conoco, Mobil and Amoco.
Will the average Briton see any benefits? The government says yes, given the
important role played by oil in supporting UK industrial production and
balance of payments.
Others disagree. Robert Mabro, head of the Oxford Institute of Energy
Studies, says the government's view is 'just crazy'. He claims the decision
not to charge companies a royalty on oil is tantamount to giving them a
national resource without charge.
Mabro adds: 'It's as if the government handed out buildings rent-free to
businesses and simply charged them corporation tax on their profits.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Twelve choruses of a market cycle -
In the Pink / John Train takes a sceptic's look at Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN TRAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Train is chairman of Montrose Advisers, investment counsel in New York.
His latest book, The Craft of Investing, has just been published by
HarperCollins.
Major market cycles have a life of their own, like the ups and downs of a
manic depressive patient. The choruses - sung at each stage from Excelsior
on the way up to De profundis as the market falls through the floor - are
not based on objective data; they are just rationalisations for what
everyone is doing.
1. The Washout: 'Stocks Are Going Way Down.'
At the bottom of a market crash, business news is usually terrible and many
authorities declare that things will probably get worse. The public dumps
stocks without regard to value.
Eventually, though, a point is reached where everybody who can be scared
into selling has sold. Usually, the final battle occurs in a few days of
extremely high volume known as a 'selling climax.'
2. The Early Surge: 'Things look better but it's too early to buy. Wait for
a pull-back.'
The government, shocked by the decline and, as always, beset by the clamour
to 'do something', announces public works and other stimuli which, of
course, will not take effect until many months later.
So, the pundits declare that, this time, the stimulus isn't working. 'It's
like pushing on a rope,' they say.
Months go by and prices rise. A few mutual funds will have been started
during the bottom area: indeed, you read that the Hercules fund has risen 75
per cent in six months.
When 'everybody' is waiting for a buying opportunity, there will ordinarily
be no buying opportunity.
3. The Surge Continues: 'Prices seem high. It's too late to buy.'
More months pass and the market establishes an upward channel. Higher prices
pull in buying from the institutions waiting on the sidelines. The public
moves from feeling that it is too early to buy to suspecting it might be too
late.
4. The Second Stage of the Rocket: 'Maybe it's okay to buy.'
A year or so after the bottom, the public, watching from the sidelines,
becomes interested. There are a number of downward bounces, or tests,
against the bottom of the market's rising channel. Each time, the recovery
starts from a higher level.
5. Not a Cloud in the Sky: 'Buy]'
More months go by, the market is way up and the public is hooked. Business
news is excellent. The 'standard forecast' is optimistic. Jazzy new funds
proliferate. Some particular market area becomes a market darling, if not a
mania, and is bid up to irrational levels. We see, also, the latest
leveraging toy - this time, the use of derivatives - on a vast scale.
6. The Blow-off: 'Stocks can only go up.'
Hot managers become famous. They chase new themes as a pack. It then becomes
profitable to jump aboard a trend (in the early 1970s, each hot growth
stock; in the early 1990s, the latest emerging country) instantly before the
less-hot managers get hold of it and run it up.
7. Coasting: 'The market does seem high but this time it's different.'
As the months wear on, stocks hesitate; their upward pace slows, with only a
few favourites making new highs. The market analyst detects this by the
falling ratio of advances to declines.
Business starts to peak, but enthusiasts rationalise that the government has
mastered the business cycle; or that there is an absolute shortage of
stocks; or that emerging markets are a new world; or that hedge funds can
make 20 per cent a year in any market.
In a bull market, though, enough stock is 'manufactured' to satisfy
everyone. 'When the ducks quack, feed 'em.'
8. The Top: 'Hold]'
The government, concerned about speculation and economic overheating, starts
leaning against the wind. The Federal Reserve raises the discount rate a
notch.
Another few months pass and we see a series of vicious reactions, or chops.
The arrival of belated 'second chance' buyers halts each decline and puts
the list up to new highs.
9. Over the Hump: 'It's too soon to sell.'
The public remains heavily in the market but the professional investors are
edging out. A downward channel is established.
10. The Slide: 'Prices are cheap but it's too late to sell.'
After a few more months, a number of issues have fallen appreciably from
their highs, perhaps 15 per cent. The market, like a tired horse that no
longer feels the whip, sinks on bad news but fails to respond to
governmental stimulation measures and bullish company announcements.
11. 'It's okay to sell.'
After a while, we may see a severe decline, with perhaps 25 per cent marked
off the prices of the more volatile issues. There is often a deceptive
recovery, which one might call the 'crap rally'.
12. The Cascade: 'Sell]'
Now the river sweeps over the brink, carrying everything with it. A cardinal
point of market strategy, if one is a trader, is to get out before this
cascade, even if you have lost 15 or 20 per cent already.
Business news is bad and the standard forecast is for stormy weather. The
hot-fund managers have to meet redemptions but find out that illiquid
securities cannot be sold and depart in disgrace.
13 (or back to 1 again). The Selling Climax: 'The market's going way down.'
The torrent crashes down the hills. Some stocks give up in a day their gains
for a year, and drop 50 per cent in a week. It is so sudden and so awful
that, for a while, many investors cannot quite believe it.
So here we are again, four years or so after we started out, half drowned,
bones broken, washed out. But if you have kept some reserves intact and know
enough to recognise real value when it is being dumped by panicky,
uninformed sellers, and have the guts to act, then you can make the buys of
a lifetime at these moments.
We have had eight economic storms since the second world war. Each time,
investors became convinced that the skies would never clear or the sun shine
again. But it always does.
And where are we now? The best strategy for most readers is not to try to
catch market swings. Nevertheless, it looks to me as though we have gone
through a typical top formation and are now on the way down, perhaps between
stages 9 and 10. So, I am maintaining a comfortable buying reserve.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Campaigners all at sea: Are environmentalists now in danger
of extinction? Bronwen Maddox examines their future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenpeace, the world's most famous environmental group, defender of nature
against man, now faces threats to its own survival. It has been widely
applauded by the public as the conscience of the west, and feared by
politicians and heads of industry. But now, both friends and enemies are
asking whether Greenpeace has had its day.
As Pete Wilkinson, a former board member, says: 'Greenpeace now has a fleet
of ships running around the oceans looking for something to do.'
Many whaling vessels, harried so successfully in the 1970s and 1980s by
Greenpeace, have been chased back into port. The cargo ships which once
tipped toxic wastes into the seas have been laid up by government orders. On
land, the worst effects of industrial effluent have been curbed by new laws.
During the last quarter of a century, Greenpeace achieved extraordinary
success in changing the relationship between advanced industrial societies
and the natural world. To some extent, it has campaigned itself out of a
job. Moreover, recession in industrialised countries temporarily restrained
pollution, and also reduced the money available to tackle it.
These tensions have resulted this summer in bitter infighting among
Greenpeace's senior members. The row reflects fears that the organisation is
losing its voice: that it can no longer catch the public's imagination as it
used to do, or promote visions of a brighter, greener future.
The campaigns which won Greenpeace early prominence - against nuclear
testing, seal culling, and whaling - established a powerful public image of
courageous campaigners in inflatable dinghies risking their lives to
challenge steel ships loaded with weaponry.
But the power of that image is waning. As Wilkinson puts it, the spectacular
protests which became the group's trademark have been becoming 'a bit of a
yawn: bigger and bigger banners on bigger and bigger buildings'.
To move forwards now, Greenpeace - and the rest of the environmental
movement - must grapple with difficult economic and scientific issues which
many Greens have so far ignored. However its new quest for solutions to
environmental problems is taking the group away from the traditional ground
of pressure groups and deep into the realm of politics, economics and
science where it has less expertise. As Greenpeace elaborates its theories
of how societies should be organised to meet its environmental standards
they are revealed as incoherent.
Its present conflicts partly reflect the distance Greenpeace has travelled
since it was founded. Its roots - and its evocative name - grew out of
Canadian opposition to US nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka, a tiny island
off the western coast of Alaska, in the late 1960s. Two of its founders were
Quakers; according to the authorised history of the group, its tactic of
spectacular non-violent protests, or 'direct action', was drawn from that
religion's tradition of 'bearing witness', a form of passive resistance.
Tom Burke, a former director of pressure group Friends of the Earth and
adviser to John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'The secret of
Greenpeace's success is that it has always looked like David against
Goliath.'
But David is now Goliath-sized. Greenpeace operates in 30 countries,
connected by electronic mail and fax, and has five ocean-going ships. Its
annual income is about Dollars 150m from its 3.8m members worldwide, even
though individual subscriptions are low. In the UK, a supporter pays Pounds
14.50 a year.
The Greenpeace message has proved particularly resonant in north Europe and
north America: those countries have a deep tradition of romanticism about
the natural world, which also found expression in the 'flower power' of the
1960s.
Greenpeace cleverly turned that sympathy into active support. David
McTaggart, an American property developer, who was the group's charismatic
leader during its formative years, and is now its honorary chairman, wrote
to senior staff two years ago: 'We must have at least one soft issue . . .
to take the edge off our 'whack-em' image . . . Anybody who has ever tried
to sell Greenpeace to the public knows that dreams are better than
nightmares at winning people over.'
McTaggart, who now lives on an olive farm near Rome, also explained the way
Greenpeace should convert its recruits to what it calls heavy issues:
'Hundreds of thousands of people . . . joined Greenpeace to save the whales.
Who knows how many heard the message about nukes?'
Greenpeace displays similar worldliness in courting the world's media.
Newsdesks are well-used to the arrival late on Friday of a thick Greenpeace
report embargoed for Monday papers, which are often short of news. The
tactic infuriates government press officers, who are forced to track down
civil servants on the golf courses to extract a reply, but it often
succeeds.
As a result, ministers and industrialists credit the group with great
influence. Tim Yeo, the former UK environment minister, says: 'We were very
careful to respond to what they were saying about the ozone layer partly
because we thought they were on the right track but also because public
involvement was important.'
After years of confident expansion, however, Greenpeace has found that
memberships in some regions are falling, particularly in the US and Sweden.
Worldwide revenue fell by 8 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Last month,
Greenpeace International, the umbrella organisation with headquarters in
Amsterdam, agreed to cut 10 per cent from its Dollars 30m annual budget for
international campaigning; and 10 per cent of the international staff are to
go.
Those cuts have provoked internal opposition, in which seasoned campaigners
have turned their skills of attack on each other.
Pressure groups are more prone than rock bands to splits and schisms.
However, the savagery of the latest argument stems from the feeling among
some staff that the leaders have betrayed the founders' purpose, and are
replacing direct action with quasi-academic research. 'The bureaucrats have
taken over. They've reached 40-something and they want a quiet life,' one
former staff member said.
Particular venom has been directed at Lord Melchett, the 46-year-old former
Labour Cabinet member and executive director of Greenpeace UK. He began two
years ago to haul the UK branch through the transformation on which
Greenpeace International is now embarking, arguing that 'the world in which
we work has changed'.
Although Norway resumed commercial whaling in spite of a 1986 international
ban, and Japan catches several hundred whales a year for 'research', there
are now many fewer such ships to chase. Sea-dumping of radioactive waste was
banned almost worldwide under an amendment to the London Convention in
February. Industrialised countries have agreed to phase out production of
many chemicals which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere under the 1987
Montreal Protocol. Perhaps most importantly, more than 150 countries
acknowledged at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit that the risk of global warming
and loss of species were worth attention.
This legislative flurry has usurped some territory on which Greenpeace made
its most popular stands. In order to keep attracting attention, McTaggart
has urged it to consider 'the gray (sic) area between violence and
non-violence . . . I am not suggesting we go violent . . . (but) we need to
investigate ways of making our campaigns heavier'.
Its marine bias may prove a handicap to its appeal, however: it campaigns
easily and rapidly against drift net fishing, oil tanker spills and whaling,
but does little work on tropical forests, in spite of their popular appeal.
Recent campaigns suggest that the group is moving further from public
passions. Last year Greenpeace took its campaign against the start-up of the
UK's Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant campaigns to the High Court, at
considerable financial risk. Yet Melchett acknowledges that it was not, at
least initially, of great concern to the group's supporters.
As Wilkinson puts it: 'For years they've been looking for 'the new whale' -
they need to translate the image of the ship chasing the whale into the
1990s. But problems now are more technical.'
The UK branch, in recognition of that task, appointed Chris Rose as campaign
director two years ago. A 38-year-old former biologist, he argues that
Greenpeace must provide answers as well as attacks.
He calls this approach 'solution intervention', a phrase which staff grumble
is 'hardly a banner to march under'. But the old guard has cautiously
welcomed a campaign, launched last month, which typifies the new strategy.
Dubbed 'Greenfreeze', it is a 'green' supermarket freezer, designed in
consultation with industry, and containing coolants which do not damage the
ozone layer. Recently, a 70ft-truck bearing the slogan 'Tesco's freezers
wreck the planet', containing a demonstration of 'planet-friendly freezers',
has been touring the UK.
The change of direction represented by Greenfreeze is a courageous surrender
of some of the romance and adrenalin of the early days. It remains to be
seen, however, whether such campaigns will catch the public's interest.
Moreover, a move from emotive slogans such as 'Save the whale' to a more
analytical style will draw attention to the weaknesses of Greenpeace's
ideas.
For a start, it has great difficulty in ranking some environmental threats
above others, a discrimination which governments must make as resources to
combat pollution are limited.
At heart, this stems from a quarrel with the nature of scientific proof,
according to which accepted theories are repeatedly revised in the light of
new evidence.
There is, nonetheless, such a thing as scientific knowledge: some theories
are persistently better than others at explaining events. But while
Greenpeace will accept research that a substance is harmful, they will
accept no evidence that a substance is safe. Further studies, they say,
might reveal undetected damage. The consequence is that no one can ever show
that enough has been done.
A second source of incoherence is in Greenpeace's ambivalence about economic
growth. Many campaigners appear to regard the notion of an
environmentally-friendly industry as a contradiction in terms. Melchett
says, for example, that the group's goal in campaigning against toxic
discharges is for 'zero discharges of any kind - clean production'. Asked if
this is a reasonable target to set industry, he shrugs and says: 'I'm happy
for companies to complain that it's not.'
Perhaps the biggest equivocation concerns trade. Last year Greenpeace
circulated a manifesto calling for 'environmental protection (to be) the
over-riding goal of trade rules' such as the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. It urges all countries to be more self-sufficient. But many
developing countries argue that such principles prevent them raising living
standards, and set 'green' concerns above the health and hopes of some of
the poorest people on earth.
Such stances imply that many in Greenpeace are uncomfortable with the
existence of people, given that most human activities pollute the
environment. Those contradictions now confront Greenpeace as it seeks to
step beyond its traditional role of simply registering opposition to
government and business.
The mission which McTaggart bestowed on Greenpeace was 'to get our world
into the 21st century in one piece'. Five years from the millennium, the
world looks likely to keep going.
It is less clear that Greenpeace's sense of mission and its public support
will survive.

FT  12 NOV 94 / The appeal of an incoherent ideology: It is five years since
the Wall fell and the world changed. Western politicians have not yet
adjusted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years have crawled by since the fall of the Berlin Wall and still we
have not begun to comprehend the consequences for liberal democracy. Before
November 9 1989, political discourse in the west was clear. Today all is
murky.
Before the fall, an era that historians may come to label BF, the foreign
policy of members of the Atlantic alliance could be defined in a single
sentence. We had to counter the Soviet threat. Now, AF, the most powerful
incentive for action by US or European governments is the appearance of this
war or that disaster on the little screen. In the four decades BF, Nato was
our bulwark; in year 6 AF we must wonder, as a distinguished American did
privately the other day, whether there is any point to a defence alliance
that everyone wants to join.
In that other, BF, world the political union of the nations of western
Europe seemed a sensible form of defence against ideological seepage from
the east. Now the reasons for the existence of the European Union are less
clear. As a regional market it may make sense. As a political unit, an
embryonic super-state, it does not. The number of members will nearly double
if all potential applicants to the east and north join. The likely outcome
is that there will be a loose Gaullist confederation, its affairs heavily
influenced by a tight, German-managed, inner circle. No one has begun to
learn how to handle that.
While the wall stood, domestic politics were not difficult to understand. In
most developed western democracies the choice lay between parties that
broadly supported the free market and those that did not. In the US the
Democrats were perceived as the purveyors of big government, the Republicans
of minimalism. Today, AF, all serious politicians embrace the market and
some question the purpose of government itself. As a pair of generalities
that is clear enough. The trouble is that, once having uttered them, no
party seems to have a coherent idea of what to do next.
While they savour their triumph in this week's mid-term elections, the
Republicans might reflect that they are as ideologically confused as the
rest of us. Daniel Finkelstein, who recently picked at the intellectual
threads of US conservatism, could vouch for this. Mr Finkelstein is director
of the Social Market Foundation, a think-tank that publishes papers more or
less apposite to its name. He has discerned four separate intellectual
strands among thinkers on the American right.
Some Republicans remain wedded to what Margaret Thatcher, as she then was,
called rolling back the frontiers of the state. Others would reform
government by deregulating, decentralising, and cutting taxes. A further
group looks to the re-establishment of moral values, particularly in regard
to sexual behaviour. That lot should be watched. Protestant fundamentalism
is a peculiarly US menace.
Finally, the Republicans harbour protectionists, isolationists, and those
who would erect barriers to immigration. These disparate factions just might
come together now that they see a chance of winning the presidency in 1996.
Do not bet on it. There will be as many different ideological messages
preached as there are Republicans who picture themselves running for the
White House.
Echoes of many of the elements in US conservative thinking could be found
among Bill Clinton's 'new Democrats' during the latter's victorious campaign
two years ago. The Republicans' 'Contract with America', published in time
for last week's elections, implied continued federal spending and promised a
balanced budget as well as lower taxes. The 1992 offering by the Clinton
Democrats made about the same amount of sense. The American middle class,
which dominates the voting, is plainly as mixed up as the politicians it
elects.
Nowhere is the frustrating search for a political programme suited to our AF
era more evident than in Britain. The Conservative party is an unruly
coalition of free market liberals, continental-style Christian Democrats,
would-be fundamentalists, ranting little Englanders and sophisticated
internationalists. The resemblance to Mr Finkelstein's conservative
Republicans is plain.
The government wants more privatisation, but is hamstrung over the Post
Office. It wants to be at the heart of Europe, yet fight 'federalism'. It
proposes less government, yet seeks to extend the hand of the state into
every classroom, hospital and police station. It offers individual liberty,
while preaching 'family values'.
The policies put forward by Tony Blair's 'new' Labour party seem less
self-contradictory, but that may be because there are so few of them. The
Labour leader does not seek to return Britain to the 1970s, when his party
was last in charge. After the fall that would be impossible. We must move
on, he said this week. He spoke of Britain's 'world-class firms and
industries', talked of 'putting customers first', sought to tackle 'welfare
dependency', and, in a fit of inspiration, spoke of individual business men
and women helping a Labour government in a 'whole range of
quasi-governmental activities'. His listeners, executives who support
'business in the community' may have fancied they saw the speaker grow
pretty blonde hair and sprout a handbag on his wrist.
At the next election in 1996 or 1997, British voters may well choose a
business-friendly Labour party, complete with the promise of seats on
quangos for Tories and businessmen. The leader of the people's party says
that you will not even have to contribute to Conservative funds to get such
an appointment. He has no manifesto yet, but, believe me, it will promise
welfare reform, national renewal, a sense of community, more jobs, better
education - and low taxes. It will speak to the disquiet many people feel at
'unfettered' free markets. The Conservatives will offer the same, with tax
cuts up front. In the AF world there are no competing philosophies, just
competing nuances.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Old mistakes . . . and new - In the late
1990s the rich countries may face serious debt crises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome to a new spot for this column, but the issues remain the same.
Spending is more pleasant than paying the bills. Promises are cheap,
delivery is costly. Financial markets are unpredictable, but if you stand
back far enough you can detect a pattern.
First, the short view. It has been a week for right swings in the US. George
Foreman's fist struck a blow for the over-40s. And, on Tuesday, the right
hit back tellingly at President Bill Clinton, reducing the Democratic party
to minority status in Congress and condemning Clinton himself to the role of
a prisoner in the White House.
Briefly, the markets celebrated with a traditional rush of blood to the
head. As a gut reaction, markets like conservative administrations. But the
enthusiasm soon faded. Two years of political stalemate seem like a far from
inspiring prospect. Meanwhile, the US electorate remains as contradictory as
ever. On the one hand, there are all the complaints about 'big government'
and excessive taxes; on the other, there is little sign of acceptance of a
parallel case for serious public spending cuts.
Recent Republican history is scarcely impressive for its emphasis on sound
finance. The Reagan administration, after all, left the US with a heavy
extra burden of debt as the nation embarked on an unprecedented and unbroken
series of budget deficits. From under 20 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s,
net debt reached 30 per cent by the end of his presidency in 1989 and is now
about 40 per cent. While the US government has chronically over-spent and
under-taxed, household savings have dwindled from an inadequate 9 per cent
of disposable income to a minimal 4 per cent now.
In the UK, the political trends are scarcely more encouraging. The usual
propaganda has been emerging from Whitehall about public spending cuts, but
much of this represents the impact of unexpectedly low inflation. The
government has only itself to blame for its painful struggle to balance the
books: it won the last election, in 1992, partly by cynically stoking up
public spending (mainly by raising pay rates) and partly by promising low
taxes. Soon after the poll, a clamp was placed on public sector pay and
taxes were raised. But it is a trick that cannot be pulled twice.
The financial consequences are clear in the Bank of England's annual
exercise of calculating the national debt. In the year to March, this jumped
by almost Pounds 60bn to Pounds 307bn. Every new-born babe inherits a Pounds
5,400 share. Fortunately, the burden is by no means unbearably high by past
standards, or in comparison with other countries such as Canada, Sweden,
Belgium or Italy. Nevertheless, the UK government's net debt in 1993-94
jumped by the equivalent of 5.4 per cent of GDP, making Bill Clinton look
like a fastidious housekeeper.
The deficit not only showed how far the UK was living beyond its means but
also gave a warning of how rapidly a deterioration can occur. Historically,
the damage has been done only by wars but, today, the public spending
machine of a modern welfare state can run out of control swiftly in
peacetime.
With luck and good management, though, the further rise in debt in the
present financial year will be little more than 3 per cent. This is from a
level of 38 per cent of GDP on the basis of net debt. And although the
Maastricht-style gross debt formula gives a figure of 48 per cent, the UK
is, ironically, still much better placed in relation to the 60 per cent
ceiling for monetary union candidates than are most of the other EU member
states. But the Maastricht rules will, of course, be bent.
In the 1980s, we were troubled by financial crises in poor countries. For
years, we used to worry about when and how Mexico would default. Most of
such countries have been allowed duly to renege on the bulk of their debts
and are now at various stages of a third world economic boom. Capital is
flooding in again from the west, although through the securities markets
rather than the banks this time.
The feature of the late 1990s, however, could well be financial crises in
rich countries. Their citizens have voted for expensive social benefits but
are not willing to pay higher taxes. They are also keen to import cheap
goods from developing countries made by workers whose social security
benefits are minimal to non-existent. You don't have to be Sir James
Goldsmith to appreciate that there might be a contradiction here.
Several economic and social trends pose a long-run challenge to public
finance. The private economy is shrinking in relative terms, the public
economy is expanding. Essentials such as food, clothing and manufactured
goods, which used to loom prominently in personal budgets and in the economy
at large, have become much cheaper in relative terms because of vast
increases in productivity. But education, health and (for demographic
reasons) care of the elderly are becoming much more important and are all
highly labour-intensive. Unlike training shoes, they cannot be imported
cheaply from the Far East.
The particular problem is that in many western countries these services are
provided mostly by the state. Either they must be privatised or taxes must
rise and rise; but the risk of a transitional crisis of over-indebtedness is
obvious.
As for the long view, it is that governments learn from past mistakes but
manage to discover new ones. In the 1930s, for instance, monetary
contraction and a trade war were allowed to cause an economic slump. By the
1970s, too much monetary expansion led to inflation. In the 1990s, the
monetary statistics around the developed world look almost perfect - neither
soaring nor slumping - but over-spending governments have opened up the
global capital market and are raiding the world's dwindling savings.
With Congress and Clinton competing to cut US taxes, it looks as though the
limits of this strategy may be tested.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Secret life of a shopaholic - On the surface,
she looks quite normal. Underneath, she has an uncontrollable urge to spend,
spend, spend . . . all the way to financial disaster
</HEADLINE>

Miranda works for a blue-chip American firm in the City of London. She is
36, successful, personable, confident. She earns Pounds 45,000 and is about
to be promoted to a more senior job in New York. On the surface, life is
going well for her. Yet, she has a problem. All week, she helps her clients
make better sense of their money. On Saturdays, she feeds a secret vice that
threatens to destroy everything. Miranda is a shopaholic.
So far, she is Pounds 60,000 in debt, half of which she owes to various
department stores and credit card companies: Harvey Nichols, Harrods, House
of Fraser, Visa, American Express, John Lewis and half a dozen others. The
rest she owes to her bank which, a few weeks ago, told her she was close to
being bankrupt. On one occasion last summer, she spent Pounds 3,000 in an
hour at Harvey Nichols alone.
Miranda is an extreme case of an increasingly common problem. According to
Mintel, a market research company, 15 per cent of people in the UK are
addicted shoppers. This is a complaint of modern times, a disorder akin to
bulimia, alcoholism or gambling. It affects women far more than men and
touches all classes and levels of income. And Dr Richard Elliott, a consumer
psychologist at Lancaster University, who is carrying out government-funded
research into compulsive shopping, says the increasing availability of
credit is partly to blame.
For Miranda, it all started 12 years ago. She had just bought a house with
her boyfriend, who showed her that the place could be furnished in style -
and all on credit. She came from a respectable, middle-class family that had
never owed a penny. His family was different. 'They were very go-getting. It
was an eye-opener to me,' she says.
The relationship soon fell apart and Miranda found herself a single woman in
London. 'I was part of a lively social set with people who were earning more
money than me. I wanted to be included, and I used to treat people to
things. Before I knew it, I had a Pounds 1,000 overdraft.'
When she reached the limit on her credit cards, she did not stop. Instead,
she found her bank was more than happy to consolidate her credit card debts
into a Pounds 1,500 loan. 'It was very easy - no one made me suffer from it.
I started to take three or four holidays a year, to the Canaries, Greece,
Italy. I wanted to look my best, so I used to buy clothes.'
At that stage, she was going to such high street shops as Wallis and
Principles, and spending Pounds 300 a time. 'I'd see a dress I liked and buy
it in three colours, or buy two exactly the same. I always made sure I had
the money to spend. I'd apply for a new credit card, thinking about it as
Pounds 25 a month, the minimum repayment. I never thought about how I was
going to pay it back. Instead, I thought: I want that dress and I want it
now.'
As her tastes grew more expensive, the number of her credit cards grew, too.
The credit reference agencies had no problem with Miranda. Her well-paid,
steady job looked impressive, as did the regularity with which she always
met the (minimum) repayments on all her cards.
By the late 1980s, she had shifted into a new gear. She got loans from Marks
and Spencer and the Beneficial bank totalling Pounds 6,000 - enough to clear
the debt off all her cards and start again, this time with higher credit
limits. Other credit companies would write offering to lend her more, and
she would leap at the offer.
The spree might have stopped in 1990 if her bank had decided to be more
difficult. The manager agreed to extend the loan to Pounds 15,000, although
he insisted that she cut up all her cards under his nose. But he made one
mistake. 'He did not tell me to cancel the accounts. So, I got all the
companies to send me replacement cards.' By this time, she had so many
clothes and shoes she could hardly get them in through the doors of her
small flat.
Once, she tried to call a halt to the spending, and started repaying some of
the debt - but it did not last. 'My boyfriend had an affair with his
secretary and that knocked my confidence.' It was the perfect excuse for a
monumental spending spree to cheer herself up.
Eventually, she reached a stage where there was no looking back. 'I owed
about Pounds 30,000 then and, when you get to that level, there is no point
in trying to pay it off. It would have taken 10 years, and the thought of
not being able to buy anything for that time was . . . well, unpalatable.'
About two years ago, she was approached by an aggressive credit company from
the US trying to break into the London market. It offered her a gold card
with a Pounds 6,000 limit - and took on all the outstanding debt from the
other cards.
Over the past year, her finances have become more and more difficult to
balance. Eventually, her bank told her she had no choice other than
bankruptcy. She did not agree. Instead, she suggested an Individual
Voluntary Arrangement under which her debts will be reduced to a manageable
size. The deal will mean surviving on Pounds 200 a month for the next three
years, which will be hard when her dry-cleaning bill alone comes to Pounds
40. Yet, she thinks she can do it. 'I have a strong will. I gave up
chocolate seven years ago and haven't touched it since,' she says.
Privately, she hopes there will be a quicker way out. On holiday in Marbella
last year, she saw a clairvoyant. 'She told me never to worry about money. I
would meet a very rich man and never need think about it again.'
(Miranda is not her real name).

FT  12 NOV 94 / Swedish political rivals unite to call for Yes vote on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, and Mr Carl Bildt, his chief
political rival, joined in a rare show of unity last night to appeal for a
Yes vote in tomorrow's referendum on joining the European Union.
With the latest opinion polls showing the outcome will hinge on a large
portion of still undecided voters, Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt appeared
together in a final television debate, arguing that membership of the Union
was vital for Sweden's economy.
Two polls published yesterday showed the Yes and No campaigns neck-and-neck,
with up to 20 per cent of the electorate still uncertain. One poll, in the
Gothenburg Post newspaper, showed the Yes campaign moving ahead by 42 per
cent to 39 per cent. A second, in Dagens Nyheter, showed the two sides at
40-40.
Mr Carlsson's Social Democrats ousted Mr Bildt from power in September's
general election. But the two men united in the debate hoping that their
combined political authority would overcome a strong anti-EU campaign led by
dissident Social Democrats, leftwingers and environmentalists.
Yesterday, Stockholm's financial markets were nervous, with long-term
interest rates moving upwards early in the day. But with the latest polls
giving sign of a Yes recovery after a surge for the No side a week ago,
interest rates fell back. The krona strengthened and Stockholm stocks rose
marginally.
The referendum will determine the success of the EU's enlargement programme.
Fellow applicants Austria and Finland have already voted to join, but a
rejection by Sweden would represent a serious snub for Brussels, almost
certainly presaging a No vote in Norway. The EU wants to bring the four new
members in from January to clear the way for closer ties with, and eventual
integration of, eastern and central European countries.
But if Sweden votes Yes, the chances of Norway doing so on November 28 will
be greatly increased. Yesterday, an opinion poll in the Norwegian newspaper
Aftenposten showed, for the first time for several months, the Yes vote
moving ahead of the No side - by 46-41 per cent - if Sweden decides to join.
Another showed the two sides equal at 41 per cent in the same circumstances.
In Stockholm, Mr Mats Hellstrom, minister for Europe, said Sweden would push
for greater openness in EU affairs.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Wales and north lead the way as recovery continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wales and the north of England, the UK's most export-oriented regions, are
leading the recovery among British manufacturers, a quarterly regional
trends survey showed yesterday.
The survey from the Confederation of British Industry and Business
Strategies, a regional economic consultancy group, said Wales and the north
had reported the fastest growth of Britain's 11 regions in terms of total
demand and output in the four months to October. The survey was carried out
between September 23 and October 12.
Of four regions that reported order books 'above normal', Wales and northern
England produced the strongest results, followed by the West Midlands and
south-west. Wales and northern England also reported the highest level of
anticipated export orders for the four months ahead.
New orders rose in all 11 regions for the third quarter in succession and
output increased for the second consecutive quarter. Companies in all
regions expected higher export orders in the four months ahead, while all
regions except Northern Ireland were more optimistic than before about
exports over the coming 12 months.
Manufacturers in 10 regions said they intended to authorise increased
capital spending on plant and machinery in the next 12 months, with
companies in Wales, the south-west, the Midlands and Yorkshire and
Humberside showing strong investment intentions. Only in East Anglia did
companies plan less investment. Paradoxically, East Anglia was the region
where general business confidence was strongest.
Mr Charles Burton, BSL's joint managing director, said the strong export
business of manufacturers in Wales and northern England explained their
strong showing in the survey. Thanks to growth in world trade, those
regions, which also benefited greatly from inward investment, were now
catching up the West Midlands and the south-east, which had led recovery.
Manufacturers in East Anglia and Northern Ireland lagged in the latest
survey because they depended more on domestic demand and consumer goods
production, he said. Manufacturing in north-west England also suffered -
partly because of the region's dependence on the defence industry and a
relative lack of inward investment.
The survey showed upward movement in prices and costs.

FT  12 NOV 94 / GEC appointment adds to speculation on succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation over the likely succession at GEC, the UK's biggest electrical
and electronics company, intensified yesterday after Mr Peter Gershon was
appointed managing director of GEC-Marconi, the group's most profitable
subsidiary.
Mr Gershon, 47, is managing director of GPT, the telecommunications
equipment joint venture between GEC and Siemens of Germany. He will replace
Mr Roy Gardner, 48, who has been appointed finance director of British Gas.
Mr Gardner will remain a non-executive director for the period of GEC's bid
for the submarine builder VSEL.
Mr Gershon, Mr Gardner and Mr James Cronin, 56, managing director of GEC
Alsthom, were appointed to the GEC main board in July this year. This
suggested that the choice of successor to Lord Weinstock, who retires in two
years at the age of 72, would be made from the three newcomers together with
Mr David Newlands, 47, GEC finance director, and Mr Simon Weinstock, 42,
commercial director and Lord Weinstock's son.
City observers believe Mr Gershon is now favourite after an energetic
performance at GPT where he has cut costs and improved profitability. He
took over the telecommunications company after working for the computer
manufacturer ICL and as managing director of STC Communications. He was not
prepared to comment yesterday.
Mr Gardner said his decision to move from GEC had been taken several months
ago. He had a number of offers, chiefly in electronics businesses, but had
decided to make a clean break.
He said the succession at GEC had been a consideration, but that similar
opportunities existed at British Gas.
His appointment was greeted with little surprise in the City yesterday.
British Gas shares slipped 5 1/2 p to 291p as analysts cautiously welcomed
the appointment. Stockbrokers are relieved that British Gas has brought in a
director from outside as further evidence of the drive to change the
corporate culture.
Mr Richard Giordano, chairman, is himself a recent arrival at British Gas
and has pledged to convert the company from the inward-looking mentality of
a former nationalised monopoly to a fast-moving international player.
'Roy Gardner's line management and overseas experience will obviously be
useful, but he's unlikely to be able to change the core of the company or
its performance,' said Mr Steven Turner, energy analyst at Nomura, the
Japanese securities house.
However, Mr Gardner is well respected in the City for his efforts in
restructuring STC.

<TEXT>
Mr Roy Gardner's decision to leave GEC for British Gas suggests intriguing
prospects for two of the UK's largest companies. His departure as
GEC-Marconi's managing director makes his successor Mr Peter Gershon
front-runner to take over from Lord Weinstock when he retires as GEC's
managing director. Meanwhile, Mr Gardner's arrival as Gas's finance director
should further plans to shake up the former state-owned monopoly's
bureaucratic culture.
Though Lord Weinstock himself may prefer to hand over GEC's reins to his son
Mr Simon Weinstock, institutional investors are hostile to the idea. Mr
Gershon has proved himself a tough manager during four years at GPT. Not
only does Mr Gardner's departure remove one rival for the top job; after a
spell at Marconi, Mr Gershon will have had experience running GEC's two
largest subsidiaries.
Meanwhile, Mr Gardner joins a small but growing team of outsiders at the top
of Gas, led by Mr Richard Giordano who took over as chairman earlier this
year. One of Mr Gardner's main tasks will be to ensure that Gas does not
waste shareholders' funds as it presses ahead with its global ambitions.
Investors can take comfort from his time at STC where its ICL subsidiary was
sold to Japan's Fujitsu and the remaining telecoms business was then flogged
to Canada's Northern Telecom. Though there was some hand-wringing when two
national champions slipped out of British control, shareholders made
handsome profits.

FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods' new defence against the Browning-Ferris bid at least has the
virtue of novelty. UK companies have occasionally tried to ward off
predators by promising partial demergers. By offering to dismember itself,
Attwoods is breaking new ground. Such a move has sometimes been used in the
US though often in conjunction with a large, up-front payment to
shareholders. The problem for Attwoods is that it is offering no cash now,
and provides precious little indication of how much cash will be available
later.
If it had been able to put names and numbers on the expressions of interest
it has received, that would be another matter. But the document states it
can provide no formal estimates of proceeds and adds limply that the plan
will only be put into effect if Attwoods is able to achieve 'proper' value
for shareholders.
To convince investors that the BFI bid undervalues its constituent parts,
Attwoods also has to explain the non-appearance of a white knight. It argues
that no single company would want it all and that those which could afford
the lot could run into monopoly problems. Yet if, as Attwoods maintains, the
break-up value is really much more than BFI is offering, it is hard to
believe one of the smaller US waste groups could not rustle up the money. It
is just conceivable that third parties are waiting to see if BFI raises the
bid by next Friday. If a white knight fails to show, Attwoods' proposal will
be a pretty feeble substitute.

FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's reaction to yesterday's third-quarter figures from Unilever was
typical of the current reporting season. Although the figures were at the
top end of City forecasts the shares slipped slightly on the news. Most
other UK companies reporting this week also lived up to expectations, but
only British Airways received much immediate reward in its share price.
In terms of earnings forecasts, analysts' upgrades continue to outweigh
downgrades by about two to one and, while British Telecom's dividend was
slightly disappointing, Northumbrian Water braved the political backlash by
increasing its payment by 16 per cent. The good prospects for earnings and
dividends make the UK market look fairly attractive: shares are on an
end-1995 price earnings ratio of around 13.5 and a prospective yield of over
4.5 per cent.
Yet in spite of this healthy background, equities finished the week down
almost 1 per cent. One problem was that shares received no support from
gilts which could not shake off the downbeat mood in US Treasuries. Here all
eyes are on Tuesday's federal open market committee meeting with the markets
waiting, in both fear and hope, for a half-point rise in US interest rates.
Such a move should at least stabilise Treasuries and might also support a
long-awaited turning point for the dollar. Given the better inflation
outlook in the UK gilts should then continue to outperform, allowing shares
to rise in their wake. But it would be no surprise if investors sit on their
hands until after the Budget.

FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Unilever's lolly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Persil Power controversy has exposed weaknesses in Unilever's brand
management skills but it has not had a significant impact on earnings.
Third-quarter figures were robust, indicating that the profits momentum
evident at the half-year stage is still in place.
The figures suggest that buoyant returns from ice-cream and tea were offset
only to a limited extent by the vicious competition in European detergents
markets. The message is that across the vast and diverse Unilever empire
more is going right than is going awry. The margin improvement - especially
marked in the US as result of rationalisation in the detergents sector - is
likely to prove sustainable after a long period of decline. The growth of
businesses outside its main, mature markets is also an encouraging pointer
for the future: in the 'rest of the world' category, which includes
fast-growing emerging markets, sales were up by 18 per cent, with volumes
and operating profits up by more than 10 per cent. But for rationalisation
costs, margins would have risen sharply here too.
Analysts expect Unilever to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.4bn in
the full year, up from Pounds 1.9bn in 1993. Thereafter profits growth is
likely to fall to single figures. This means that, in the medium term,
earnings will grow more slowly than for the market as a whole. Even so,
Unilever deserves to maintain its market rating because of its robustness
and skill in extracting value from low-growth industries. The modest
prospective yield of under 3 per cent will, however, limit pronounced
outperformance.

FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond futures decline pulls
Dow lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices dropped in moderate trading yesterday following declines in
bond futures prices, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 20.52 at 3801.47.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.00 at 462.35, while the American Stock
Exchange composite shed 1.55 to 448.04 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.27
to 762.11. Volume on the NYSE came to 218m shares.
Volume was light, partly because the bond market was closed for the Veterans
Day holiday, but a decline in the December bond future contract pulled down
share prices.
Also holding down volume was skittishness in advance of next Tuesday's
meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee at which the Fed is
expected to boost its target interest rate by at least 50 basis points.
Shares in major cyclical stocks declined with the market. Caterpillar fell
Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 57 1/2 , and Dow Chemical lost Dollars 1 3/4 at
Dollars 67 3/4 .
Biotech stocks surged on news that a major pharmaceutical company was in
discussions to purchase a 'substantial minority equity investment' in the
biotech group, Chiron. Chiron, which is traded on the Nasdaq, rocketed more
than Dollars 19 before falling back to end with a gain of Dollars 11 3/4 at
Dollars 71 1/2 , Genentech was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 47 1/2 , Amgen
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 58, Cellpro Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 15 1/2 and
Biogen Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 . Some major US technology stocks
were stronger: IBM by Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 72 1/2 and Digital Equipment
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 30 7/8 . Hewlett-Packard ended down Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 97 5/8 .
PepsiCo gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 36 7/8 after several analysts
upgraded the shares, based on a management change in the company's
restaurant division.
Shares of Telefonos de Mexico, which lost Dollars 4 3/4 on Thursday
following news that it would face direct competition from AT&amp;T, regained
some lost territory after a James Capel analyst rated the shares a 'buy' and
said it could handle the competition. By the close Telmex ADRs were up
Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 53 1/2 .
Canada
Investors remained nervous over interest rates taking Canadian stocks lower
in a listless session. The TSE 300 composite index dropped 8.51 to 4170.68,
a fall of 28 points on the week. Volume of shares at 26.78m were down
sharply from yesterday's 51.47m. Newbridge Networks gained more ground,
adding CDollars 1 3/4 to CDollars 44 1/8 . The stock made big gains earlier
in the week following news of its strategic alliance with Hewlett Packard.
Transportation, metal, paper and pipeline stocks made small gains.
Mexico
Mexican equities were slightly higher at the close as Telmex, the
telecommunications group, recovered from its two-day fall of more than 9 per
cent, writes Ted Bardacke in Mexico City.
The IPC index ended 34.67 or 1.39 per cent, at 2,526.99, about 5 points off
its session high.
Telmex L shares were up 2.25 per cent and the A shares gained 0.67 per cent.
Analysts said that some investors saw the fall in Telmex as having been
overdone. The sell-off occurred following warnings from most major New York
brokers who downgraded the stock on news that the group had lost out on its
bid to reach an agreement with AT &amp; T to offer long distance telephone
services. Brokers commented that there was strong buying of Telmex by
domestic investors who were more bullish about its short-term earnings, as
well as the company's prospects when Mexico's telecommunications market is
opened to competition in 1997.

FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei breaks four day
losing streak
</HEADLINE>

   By Our Markets Staff

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A late recovery on Japanese institutional investment buying allowed equities
to break a four-day losing streak, but the gain was a token one, writes Our
Markets Staff.
The Nikkei 225 index rose 19.51 to 19,284.36, 2.7 per cent lower on the
week, and only a fraction off its high of 19,288.6 for the day. Earlier,
bearish foreign and individual investors had taken it to a morning low of
19,132.23.
Volume was estimated at 380m shares, up from 292.9m; the rise was partly due
to a special quotation to settle prices for November option contracts.
Declines outnumbered advances by 582 to 417 with 172 unchanged.
The Nikkei 300 rose 0.10 to 278.50, and the Topix index of all first section
issues fell 2.36 to 1,517.67. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.13
to 1248.35.
Foreign selling was triggered partly by growing anxiety about the lack of
domestic interest in Japanese shares; in contrast, said a dealer,
individuals had been sellers for weeks on disappointment over the weakness
of privatisation stocks, and the newly-listed Japan Tobacco in particular.
Sectors moved both ways. The weakest was shipping, which fell 1.2 per cent,
while foodstuffs and airlines were also emphatically lower; meanwhile, the
mining, miscellaneous manufacturing and warehouse sectors were decidedly
higher.
The mining sector was the day's strongest and ended 1.6 per cent ahead.
Among individual issues, steels were the day's most heavily traded, and
ended mixed. Fortunes were mixed elsewhere, too. The market leader, NTT,
jumped Y14,000 to Y865,000 but Japan Tobacco, listed at the end of last
month, fell another Y5,000 to Y962,000, down 33 per cent from its initial
sales price of Y1.438m.
Roundup
The region was generally preoccupied with next Tuesday's FOMC meeting in the
US.
SYDNEY closed at a 14-month low on weakness in the resources sector. The All
Ordinaries index fell 19.3 to 1,952.0, off 2.3 per cent this week. Turnover
was ADollars 670m.
BHP fell 24 cents to ADollars 19.46 after announcing a Dollars 400m USsteel
mill joint venture, and News Corp lost 14 cents to ADollars 5.56 on reports
that it planned to form a pay television joint venture with the
telecommunications carrier, Telstra, in Australia for launch early next
year.
HONG KONG retreated in the absence of any major buying from overseas
investors. The Hang Seng index lost 22.91 to 9,367.85, for a week's fall of
1.7 per cent.
Turnover rose to HKDollars 2.5bn from Thursday's HKDollars 1.7bn, mainly as
a result of buying interest in Shanghai Haixing Shipping, a newly listed H
share.
The company, which ships coal and crude oil along China's eastern seaboard,
ended at HKDollars 1.65, up 19 cents from its issue price.
SEOUL continued to consolidate in weak trading. The composite index slipped
4.30 to 1,122.57, barely changed on the week. Turnover was Won990.12bn,
compared Thursday's Won1,010bn.
Trading companies and contractors declined on news that North Korea had
rejected Seoul's proposal for bilateral economic co-operation.
TAIPEI was led higher by the financial sector, although late profit-taking
in industrials eroded some of the earlier gains. The weighted index improved
38.00 to 6,482.68, off an intra-day high of 6,521.93, for a week's rise of
1.7 per cent. Turnover was light at TDollars 41.6bn.
MANILA's composite index fell 41.60 to 2,926.61, off 5.4 per cent on a week
affected by strength in the peso against the dollar, with companies whose
earnings are tied to dollar movements particularly vulnerable: PLDT, for
instance, lost 15 pesos to 1,305 pesos and Philippine National Bank 2.50
pesos to 330 pesos.
JAKARTA concentrated on the debut of pharmaceutical company Darya Varia
which closed with a 17 per cent premium at Rp7,250.
The official index slipped 0.53 to 513.38.

FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses quiet ahead of FOMC
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses seemed studiously intent on avoiding much change in index levels
with Washington's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, and the decision on
US interest rates coming up next Tuesday, writes Our Markets Staff. Paris
and Brussels were closed for Armistice Day, and Warsaw for National Day.
FRANKFURT, once again, had little to cheer about. Thursday afternoon's rise
on short covering was set aside as the Dax index fell 4.05 to 2,078.35 on
the session, against the previous post-bourse close of 2,098.04. Turnover
fell from DM5.7bn to DM5bn. The key index slipped further after hours to end
at 2,073.67. For the second week in succession, it was only fractionally
higher over five days.
Over 24 hours, the main weakness was in cyclicals and the relative strength
in one or two banks and defensive stocks. In chemicals, Bayer and Hoechst
lost DM4.50 to DM344.50 and DM5.40 to DM325.60 respectively; in automotive
stocks Daimler fell DM12.20 to DM766 and Continental, the tyremaker, by DM4
to DM219.
Weakness in engineers coincided with the statement from the metal employers
association, Gesamtmetall, that some 40 per cent of its companies were still
making losses in the current year against 45 per cent last year. Mannesmann
dropped DM8 to DM398.50, and Thyssen by DM5.80 to DM288.20.
Dealers noted buyers for Commerzbank, the only Dax constituent which closed
higher after hours, with a rise of DM1.80 to DM322.80. Dresdner Bank slipped
DM7.50 to DM407 on a television report which alleged, against vigorous
denials from the bank, that Dresdner advised its clients to invest their
capital in Luxembourg, avoiding German taxes in the process.
AMSTERDAM declined on broadly-based selling, partly engendered by Unilever's
third quarter results which came in at the lower end of most analysts'
expectations. The AEX index was trimmed by 3.05 to 407.69, leaving it off
0.7 per cent on the week.
The multinational consumer goods group saw its shares slip Fl 1.20 to Fl
199.70 after reporting a rise in third quarter net profit of 9 per cent to
Fl 1.23bn, against a market consensus of about Fl 1.3bn.
The negative tone here spilled over into other heavyweight blue chips, with
Royal Dutch, for example, down Fl 1.00 to Fl 188.00 and Philips falling by
the same amount to Fl 52.50 on sustained US selling. Kleinwort Benson issued
a sell note on Royal Dutch after the group's slightly disappointing third
quarter figures earlier in the week. The broker said that it preferred
Petrofina, Repsol and OMV in continental Europe.
ZURICH eased slightly, but the 2.34 fall to 2,597.8 in the SMI index still
left it 2.2 per cent higher on the week.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim in Zurich said that the bourse
was still enjoying the re-rating of Swiss Re, whose move out of direct
insurance, concentration on core businesses and the implicit attack on costs
had lifted the registered shares by around 40 per cent since the move was
announced at the end of September.
Swiss Re rose another SFr28 to SFr811 yesterday and other insurers came
along for the ride, with Winterthur SFr15 higher at SFr685. In
pharmaceuticals, the mood was still good following the Republican victory in
the US elections, but for Roche certificates, down SFr80 at SFr5,810, the
celebrations went into reverse for the second day in succession.
STOCKHOLM endeavoured to make headway, but trading was subdued ahead of this
Sunday's vote on whether or not the country will join the European Union,
with opinion polls suggesting that the result will be very close.
The Affarsvarlden general index added 3.30 to 1,464.30, a week's rise of 1.5
per cent. Turnover was SKr2.7bn.
Activity was stimulated by Astra's nine-month results which exceeded market
expectations. The B shares were unchanged at SKr191, after a session high of
SKr194. Salomon Brothers, in a major report on the drug group released
yesterday, commented that Astra benefited, among other things, from low
exposure to patent expiry, with no major product patents due to expire
before 1999.
In contrast Pharmacia Bs lost SKr6 to SKr127 in reaction to disappointing
results on Thursday, and subsequent brokers' downgrades.
OSLO was helped by a fall in domestic interest rates, although trading was
dulled ahead of the Swedish referendum since the result is likely to
influence Norway's own poll on EU membership due later this month. The All
share index showed a rise of 1.4 to 598.1.

FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Signs of recovery fail to lift Italian
equities - But there is room for optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian economy is growing and inflation is relatively low; industrial
companies have shown, in half-year figures, the first clear signs of
recovery, with exporters leading the way; the privatisation programme
appears to be back on track; and, in the last three weeks, two of Italy's
biggest banks have announced their intention to mount L2,000bn bids for
control of quoted competitors.
Yet the Comit index of leading Italian equities still stands at about the
same level as at the beginning of the year, closing yesterday at 641. Those
analysts who forecast that the index would top 900 within a year of the
March general election seem unlikely to be vindicated.
'The market is getting to a level where it is cheap enough to justify buying
on fundamentals,' says Mr Andrea Ruggeri of Goldman Sachs in London. 'On the
other hand, as far as political and fiscal developments are concerned I do
not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet.'
One problem is that nobody knows how long the tunnel is. In summer, with
equity prices still sliding from their mid-May peak, investors pinned their
hopes on a rapid coalition agreement on the vital 1995 budget. Ministers
were slow in agreeing, but the final plan was stricter than most outside
observers had expected.
Now, however, the focus is on the government's ability to push the plan
through parliament, which it must do before January 1. This is no easy
matter, given the underlying level of dissent. Trade union federations are
predicting that more than a million workers will join them in Rome today for
a demonstration against the budget, following weeks of industrial action
which has reached its worst level since the 1960s.
Such considerations seem likely to keep the lid on equity prices for the
foreseeable future, aided by the reluctance of Italian mutual funds,
themselves short of new clients, to invest their reserves of cash in the
short term. But, as the low volumes of the last few months indicate, longer
term investors, notably non-Italians, are also hanging back. 'The main worry
for foreigners is not Italy as such - it's the rest of world bond and equity
markets,' says Ms Francesca Lolli, head of research at Finanziaria Indosuez
in Milan.
Real interest rates are particularly high in Italy, deterring investors from
returning to equities, in spite of the underlying performance of the
companies themselves. With confidence so fragile, it has proved easy for
unscrupulous investors to set rumours running in bond, money and equity
markets, usually based on the possibility that anti-corruption magistrates
are about to put Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, under
investigation.
Nervous and frustrated Italian ministers have taken to accusing the City of
London of conspiring to undermine the Italian currency and economy.
However, Italy has still been one of the best performing markets in Europe
this year, and there are at least three reasons for optimism about its
performance in the next nine months, assuming the political cloud lifts a
little.
Bank Bids. Shares in Italy's quoted banks have performed particularly badly
this year. Hit by the overhang of bad loans from the recession and the
underperformance of bond portfolios, the value of banking stock has fallen
by 11.5 per cent since January. The recent offers outlined by two privatised
banks - Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) for a majority stake in Banco
Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), and Credito Italiano for a majority of
Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) - have stimulated interest in the sector, and
raised the possibility that other takeovers could follow, even if the plans
already announced founder.
In addition, the whole banking sector could be due for a more solid recovery
in the first half of next year if bond trading picks up and as the quality
of loan portfolios improves. Insurers could also benefit from cutbacks to
the state pension system and proposed new legislation encouraging private
retirement provision.
Privatisation. The new government muddied the waters on privatisation policy
soon after taking office, when ministers issued a series of conflicting
statements about the speed and priorities of the programme.
Now, however, the timetable seems clearer. Yesterday, ministers outlined
their proposals for the privatisation of Enel, the state electricity
company, promising to begin the sale of shares by the middle of next year.
That should inject new liquidity into the stock market, particularly as Enel
is not yet quoted. The first six months of 1995 should also see the sale of
the treasury's outstanding stakes in Ina, the insurer, and IMI, the banking
and financial services group, and of holdings in Stet, the
telecommunications holding company, and part of Eni, the energy and
chemicals conglomerate.
Futures. The stock exchange will finally launch a futures contract on the
revamped MIB 30 index of the biggest Italian stocks in the week beginning
November 28. Analysts expect this to improve the liquidity of the underlying
market. However, they point out that big investors will only be satisfied
fully with the innovation once the borsa develops an efficient stock lending
system and introduces full cash settlement on all shares, improvements which
could be put in place next year.

FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: US interest rate fears drive Footsie
below 3,100 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The post US-election euphoria in international markets evaporated yesterday,
driving down bond and equity markets and leaving the London market in
disarray at the close of business.
The FT-SE 100 index ended the session a net 27.6 lower, only marginally
above the day's low, as dealers closed their books on the US elections and
began to prepare for next Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting in
Washington which will decide the course of US interest rates.
The FOMC meeting, seen by many market strategists as probably defining
trends in international markets for the rest of the year, is expected to see
the Federal Reserve shift short-term US interest rates by at least 50 basis
points to 5.25 per cent. A rise on Tuesday would be the sixth so far this
year.
There was no help for equity markets from international bond markets which
drifted back in thin trading, and lacking impetus from New York where the
bond market was closed for Veterans Day. Equities trading across Europe was
curtailed by the closure of French and Belgian markets for Armistice Day.
There was little genuine investment activity in London yesterday, with
marketmakers and brokers running hard to try and clinch what little activity
was in the pipeline.
Turnover came out at a dismal 494.2m shares, the lowest since Monday, with
trading in non-FT-SE 100 stocks accounting for well over half the day's
turnover.
Customer business in the market on Thursday was reported at a disappointing
Pounds 1.14bn.
Dealers lowered their opening prices yesterday, responding to a
disappointing performance on Wall Street overnight and thereafter took
avoiding action in the face of any further selling pressure as markets
became increasingly nervous about trends on Wall Street.
There was precious little support for equities all day and the 100 index
dropped to a session low of 3,072.0 before closing only four points above
that level. Second liners were never really under pressure but were marked
easier and the FT-SE Mid 250 index settled 6.4 off at 3,536.5, only 1.9
easier on the week. The 100 index was 21.7 down on the five-day period.
Their unease was justified as the Dow Jones opened under pressure and
continued to slip away as the session wore on. The Dow Jones Average was 25
points off an hour after London closed for the week.
A senior dealer at one of the UK securities houses said the big institutions
were clearly worried about Wall Street ahead of the FOMC meeting: 'The
selling may have been done before the result of the meeting but there is a
real worry about the possibility of a steep fall on Monday.' 'If there is
any sort of panic we could see the Footsie back at 3,000 in no time at all:
I feel it's wrong to be comfortable about the market,' he added.
Another marketmaker took a more positive view of the market: 'We fell back
on no business at all; there's no panic and I feel we will be better at the
end on next week.'
However, a strategist at one of the City's leading broking houses said the
market had overreacted on the downside to the Wall Street worries. 'Only the
poodles were trading today. I wouldn't take too much notice of what went
on,' he said. He said he expected a 50 basis points rise in the Fed Funds
rate but added that '75 basis points is really what is needed'. Another top
commentator said: 'What the market needs is 50 points now and an indication
of a further rise if US economic growth shows no signs of slowing.'
Redland made strong progress and posted the best gain in the FT-SE 100 in
the wake of a buy recommendation from one of the City's leading agency
brokers. Bank of Scotland improved following switching into the shares from
Abbey National.

FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a slow day, dipping lower on weak volume and moving
within a very narrow trading range, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,078 at the close of pit trading, down
29 points. The premium to the cash market was 5 points and fair value around
6 points.
There were 8.073 contracts traded against 11,592 on Thursday with some
dealers blaming the Armistice Day closure of the French futures market. In
contrast, traded option volume improved, rising to 31,129 from 24,636 in the
previous session.

FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Redland up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building materials group Redland moved against the market downtrend
following a trading buy note from James Capel which recommended clients to
switch out of RMC. Dealers also said that UBS had been supporting the stock.
Redland gained 4 to 465p in turnover of 2.1m as investors moved to scoop up
a dividend yield of 6.7 per cent, three percentage points in excess of the
Footsie average and some four points ahead of the return on RMC which closed
8 lower at 1000p.
A number of engineering shares stood out against the stock market's
seemingly inexorable commitment to red ink. British Steel gained a penny to
158 1/2 p ahead of Monday's widely expected bumper interim results. And
Rolls-Royce and GKN both added 4 to 179p and 619p respectively.
The market's ideas about British Steel's interim figures revolve around
profits of between Pounds 125m and Pounds 140m, up from Pounds 27m last
time. Rolls was the best performing Footsie stock but the reasons for the
spurt were less easy to pinpoint, although there was talk yesterday that the
group was about to announce a big Chinese aero-engine order.
Motor industry based stocks were among the more resilient in the sector with
Lucas Industries up a penny at 199p and T&amp;N holding at 369p in turnover of
4m.
Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group Unilever retreated on
profit-taking and disappointment in some quarters at the group's third
quarter figures. The shares fell 11 to 1118p, after trade of 2.7m.
However, Mr Carl Short at Strauss Turnbull remains a fan of the stock and
said the figures not only met his expectations but said Strauss was a 'buyer
of the shares for accelerated growth in 1995'.
Shares in North West Water relinquished 8 to 536p, following a city
presentation at which the company indicated plans to become more consumer
friendly. Mr Douglas Falconer at Yamaichi was among those unhappy with the
plan and said simply: 'This move is shareholder unfriendly.'
Dividend prospects boosted Welsh Water and the shares ended the session 8
ahead at 656p.
High street retailer Kingfisher relinquished 7 to 467p, as speculation that
the company was to make an offer for Matalan, a private fashion and
household goods retailer, returned to the market.
However, one analyst indicated such a move may receive a cool reception from
the market as, 'investors would rather see Kingfisher turn its existing
businesses around first, although the cost of such an acquisition would be
of little concern.'
Sentiment in the stock was further dampened by reports that consumer
electronics company Amstrad may open its own stores. Amstrad edged a 1/2
forward to 29p.
Ladbroke, which published a trading statement on Thursday, added another 3
to 157p, following a NatWest Securities recommendation. However, UBS remains
negative on the stock and analyst Mr Paul Heath at the securities house said
'there was nothing in the statement on the trading front to make us change
our current recommendation'.
Supermarket group J Sainsbury lost 8 to 411p, as several brokers advised
switching into Tesco 2 better at 247p.
BAT Industries held firm at 448p. Dealers cited support from Smith New
Court.
Clothing group SR Gent jumped 8 to 78p after announcing at the annual
meeting a leap in sales for the first 18 weeks since the end of the
financial year.
Cashmere group Dawson International firmed 2 to 133p ahead of figures next
week.
Shares in hotels group Forte closed 2 ahead at 233p, in strong business of
11m shares as dealings started in the new shares offered to the vendors of
the Meridien Hotels chain it recently acquired.

FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo worries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo reversed gains achieved earlier in the week as
one US house downgraded the stock. There were additional worries emanating
from the company's Japanese arm and the shares fell 13 1/2 to 608 1/2p.
The stock had risen sharply after the clean sweep by the Republican party
was seen to have banged the nail in the coffin of the Clinton healthcare
reforms.
However, yesterday, one US research house Hambrecht &amp; Quist, which is
believed to concentrate much of its firepower on the pharmaceutical sector
took Glaxo off its buy list and moved the stock to a hold. The house said
that although there might be some upside to the stock 'possible negative
events are much closer on the horizon'.
There was also news of the arrest of an assistant professor in western Tokyo
for allegedly accepting more than Y100,000 in bribes from two Nippon Glaxo
employees. The subsidiary denied the claims saying it had only paid legal
research fees.

FT  12 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in RBOS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A seemingly flawed trade in Royal Bank of Scotland prompted furious turnover
in the banking sector as institutional investors used the funds generated to
switch into Barclays.
Dealers said one of the UK's leading integrated securities houses had taken
a block of 2.5m Royal Bank shares on board at 242p, some 8p below the market
price. It appeared that the house was unable to find buyers and passed the
stake to rival Credit Lyonnais Laing which was happy to take it for 245p a
share, still well below the market price. Mr Martin Hughes, Laing's banking
analyst said: 'Our view is that the first seller took a very poor offer for
the shares.'
Royal Bank shares closed 8 lower at 448p with 5.8m traded. It was suspected
that much of the cash generated went towards Barclays which has been
benefiting from a big switch out of Lloyds Bank. Investors have been worried
about Lloyds exposure to the mortgage market through its proposed
acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Those concerns were
fuelled by figures published yesterday which showed that monthly mortgage
lending fell by 6 per cent in October. Lloyds lost 6 1/2 at 567 1/2 p with
turnover hitting 4.5m while Barclays held firm at 606 1/2 p with 8m changing
hands.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Markets wait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges spent a quiet day yesterday as traders fixed their gaze on
next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in the US,
writes Philip Gawith.
With no statistics of note, and markets shut for holidays in the US, France
and Belgium, trade was very subdued.
The dollar shed some of its recent gains to finish in London at DM1.528,
from DM1.5348. Against the yen it closed at Y97.5, from Y98.04.
In Europe, the D-Mark was firmer against the French franc, which closed at
FFr3.439 from FFr3.437. A poll showing Mr Jacques Delors, president of the
European commission, and possible socialist candidate next year for the
presidency, ahead of conservative rivals for the first time, bothered
markets.
The Swedish krona gained ground against the D-Mark ahead of Sunday's
referendum on EU membership, closing at SKr4.750 from SKr4.769. Analysts
said the result was too close to call.
Sterling had a steady day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.3,
from 80.4.
In a day otherwise bereft of news and statistics, the most interesting
contribution came from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank.
Speaking to bankers in Munich, he said that any move in official German
interest rate depended 'primarily' on the money supply. Other factors such
as exchange rates and commodity prices were also carefully considered.
He stressed the theme, much repeated recently, that there was scope for
German rates to both rise or fall.
'Unlike other central banks we do not operate an anti-cyclical policy. That
is why the subject of an interest rate rise by no means stands unilaterally
in the foreground,' said Mr Tietmeyer.
'Rather, we will carefully check on all sides.' The Bundesbank council left
interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Thursday.
Mr Tietmeyer said there were chances that German inflation, just below three
per cent now, would fall further.
Much attention was focused on what the Fed is likely to do on Tuesday. Most
observers are now settling for a likely 50 basis point rise in the Federal
funds rate, the market having retreated from its recent stance that nothing
short of a 75-100 basis point rise in rates would be sufficient.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has never presided over a move of
more than 50 basis points in the federal funds rate.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at Abn-Amro in London, said that
although there was more talk of the dollar having bottomed, 'there is not a
great deal of confidence that the turn is here.'
Indeed, the lack of confidence is reflected in the view of many analysts
that a 50 basis point rise will be poorly received by the foreign exchange
market.
An important caveat is that the Fed may be able to carry off such a move if
it makes clear that it has not ruled out a further, similar monetary
tightening in December.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 500m shortage, at established rates, in
its daily money market operations. Overnight money was very easy, trading
between 3 1/2 per cent and 4 3/4 per cent. This set the pattern for other
short-dated rates, with money up to one month offered below the base rate of
5 3/4 per cent.
Short sterling futures lost ground across the board, but volumes were very
thin. The December short sterling contract closed at 93.59, from 93.61 on
Thursday.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): White sugar at 4-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
White sugar futures sprang into unaccustomed prominence at the London
Commodity Exchange this week.
After a period of steady but unspectacular progress values were lifted
sharply by concern about developing supply tightness, news that the Russian
beet crop would fall heavily and suggestions that Brazil's exportable
surplus could be reduced as domestic consumption picked up. The March
delivery price yesterday touched a four-year high of Dollars 378 a tonne, up
more than Dollars 20 on the week and nearly Dollars 50 since the beginning
of October.
'There are just no sellers in this market and the shorts are having to cough
up,' one trader told the Reuters news agency. 'Technically there is really
no ceiling for the market.'
'The western Hemisphere is looking very tight,' said another trader. 'If
China and Russia had the wherewithal to buy the sugar they want right now,
London would see Dollars 500 a tonne.'
The LCE coffee market began the week in a highly agitated mood as it awaited
Brazil's official assessment of its 1995-96 crop in the wake of the June and
July frosts and the subsequent drought.
Talk that the figure could be well below recent trade estimates prompted a
flurry of buying that drove the January futures position up nearly Dollars
200 to Dollars 3,600 a tonne at one point. But Wednesday morning's
announcement burst the bubble. The Brazilian government projected a crop of
between 12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each), down from the 15.7m bags forecast
after the frosts and the 26.5m expected before them, but more or less in
line with recent market thinking.
Prices retreated quickly in response, the January position touching Dollars
3,435 yesterday before closing at Dollars 3,471 a tonne, still Dollars 63 up
on the week.
Describing the Brazilian crop estimate as 'price-neutral' Mr Celsius Lodder,
executive director of the International Coffee Organisation, said in Hamburg
yesterday: 'There is no reason for prices to go up or down'.
'The adjustments the market needed were made over the last three to four
months, perhaps a little too quickly,' he suggested. 'The current prices
seem justified before a clearer crop picture emerges in January.'
Mr Lodder said the Brazilian estimate looked accurate and well researched
but added that the ICO would present its own statistics in January, in a new
effort to provide better market services.
After repaying last week's gains with interest London Metal Exchange copper
prices got back on to their uptrend on Thursday and yesterday. A
continuation of the technical correction that followed November 3's
four-year highs took the three months delivery price down to Dollars 2,629 a
tonne on Wednesday morning. But by yesterday's close the price was back up
to Dollars 2,682.50, down just Dollars 11 on the week. News of another
sizeable fall in LME warehouse stocks of the metal aided yesterday's Dollars
17 advance.
Other base metals seemed reluctant to follow copper's upturn, however, and
most finished substantially lower on the week. The sharpest faller was
aluminium, which lost Dollars 30 of last week's Dollars 57 rise to close
yesterday at Dollars 1,854.50 a tonne for three months delivery.
A 10,525-tonne fall in LME aluminium stocks was announced yesterday, less
than the recent average but enough to confirm that the producer's
production-cutting agreement was working satisfactorily.

White pepper prices have tended firmer in recent weeks, reports Man
Producten, the main reason being the growing uncertainty about the size next
year's crops. The long drought in Indonesia will no doubt affect 1995
production, and supplies from China and Sarawak are gradually drying up.
Muntok white spot was priced at at USDollars 3,700 a tonne and for
November/December shipment at Dollars 3,650, cif. Black pepper prices tended
somewhat easier, mainly due to slow demand in recent weeks. Prices seem to
have stabilised at about Dollars 2,650 a tonne for spot black pepper faq and
at Dollars 2,575, cif, for November/December shipment. While supplies from
India and Indonesia were very limited there were more offers from Brazil.

<TEXT>
Chiron, the US biotechnology company, said yesterday it was in talks which
might lead to another, unnamed company taking a 'very substantial' minority
stake. Its statement came in response to a surge of over 30 per cent in its
share price, on very heavy volume.
Market sources speculated the other party might be Ciba of Switzerland. Ciba
said: 'As a matter of policy, we never comment on market rumour or
speculation.'
Chiron, America's third biggest biotechnology company by market value, makes
a variety of products treating diseases from cancer to multiple sclerosis.
At yesterday's peak price of Dollars 79, the group was valued at Dollars
2.6bn. The shares later fell back, closing at Dollars 71 1/2 for a net gain
of Dollars 11 3/4 on the day.
Chiron said its talks involved a potential strategic alliance, but cautioned
'no agreement has been reached and there is no assurance any transaction
will result'.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Upton gets 16% take-up on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upton and Southern Holdings, the stores group, yesterday announced that only
16 per cent of its open offer of 90.4m shares had been subscribed.
The company launched the Pounds 5.5m placing and offer of 120.3m shares to
rescue its business last month. Upton had warned that the Reject Shop, the
home furnishings retailer, would have to cease trading without the new
funds.
The placing and open offer by MeesPierson and Townsley and Co represented
about 72 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Some 30m shares were placed
with a new unnamed institutional investor, with the balance subject to the
open offer on a 49-for-20 basis.
The company said that the remaining 76.2m shares would be taken up by
institutional and other investors under the terms of the placing.
The shares closed - before the announcement - unchanged at 5p, matching the
offer price.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tomorrows Leisure restructures to cut debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrows Leisure, the USM-quoted leisure group which has been struggling to
extricate itself from a Pounds 16m debt mountain, yesterday announced a
financial and management restructuring intended to transform its prospects.
The cornerstones of the new package are a Pounds 8.9m placing and rights
issue, the conversion of Pounds 4m debt to equity and a link-up with
Wiggins, the property developer, which, with parties acting in concert, is
to take a 29.42 per cent stake.
It is also proposed to subdivide the 20p shares into one 5p ordinary and
three 5p deferred.
Three Wiggins directors, including Mr Oliver Iny, the chief executive, will
take stakes and become non-executive directors. Mr David Edwards, managing
director of Scottish &amp; Newcastle's inns division, will become managing
director.
Mr John Sanderson, Leisure's founder and current chairman, will step aside
from day to day management, becoming life president and executive director
responsible for asset development. His stake will drop from 36.8 to 5.9 per
cent.
Under the partnership proposal Wiggins will develop Leisure's 1,000 acres of
surplus land through an profit-sharing venture while Leisure will have the
opportunity to operate leisure facilities within Wiggins' property
developments.
Leisure is also acquiring a site in Lincoln with planning permission for
leisure facilities from Wiggins for Pounds 2.1m.
Wiggins believes Leisure, where interest charges at present exceed operating
profit, is undervalued due to uncertainty over its future. The new board's
intention is to keep gearing at conservative levels.
Mr Peter Dawson, a non-executive director, will become non-executive
chairman. He said: 'It's not an exaggeration to say it's a new dawn.'
Barclays Bank, currently owed Pounds 15.2m, has agreed to write off Pounds
2m and convert Pounds 4m into a revolving term loan and Pounds 3.5m into
shares. A further Pounds 5.7m will be repaid from the placing and rights
proceeds.
Some 75m shares are being placed with a right issue of a further 24.1m share
on a 2-for-1 basis both at 10p. The balance of the proceeds will be used for
working capital and acquisitions.
For the year to March 31 Leisure reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 538,000
(Pounds 5.79m) on turnover of Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.73m), including Pounds
1.13m (Pounds 1.45m) from discontinued activities. Losses per share were
1.8p (45.5p).

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Facing some bitter choices - Roderick Oram
on the problems confronting the brewing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mergers, not meteorology, are what British brewers really need to solve
their structural problems and restore their profits.
A few hot weeks in southern England this summer boosted their volumes but
did little for their bottom lines given the competitive pressures,
over-capacity and long-term decline in beer consumption afflicting the
industry.
The companies will focus on the short-term fillip during their reporting
season, which begins on Thursday with Whitbread. The rate of decline in the
industry's beer volume has slowed to about 1 per cent this year, from more
than 2 per cent last year.
The price war initiated last year by Bass and Courage has abated, although
hefty discounts are still available, particularly to large customers. They
can buy a keg of draught lager at a discount of about Pounds 90 on the
typical wholesale list price of Pounds 210, said Mr Ian Pressnell of Plato
Logic, a drinks consultancy.
Thus, profits from beer wholesaling are likely to be lower for a number of
companies, analysts forecast. But with profits rising in their other
businesses, which include pubs, wholesale drinks distribution, hotels and
holiday parks, overall profits will be up for most companies.
Looking a short way ahead, the brewers are unlikely to get any joy from the
Budget on November 29. The Chancellor is thought to be very resistant to
excise duty cuts. He has little room for financial manoeuvre, and throughout
the government there is scepticism that a duty cut would help stem the
rising tide of cross-Channel beer imports.
Even some backbenchers of the Treasury select committee, who recently heard
evidence on the subject, think brewers have exaggerated both the import
threat and the beneficial effect of bringing British duties part way down to
low French levels.
It is longer term considerations, however, which could be the most
intriguing aspect of the results season. Analysts and investors will be
searching for clues to the winners and losers in the wave of restructuring
which will roll through the industry over the next year or so.
'Getting down from five to four big brewers, and then quickly down to three,
would have a dramatic and positive impact on the industry after years of
being moribund,' says Mr Ian Shackleton, an analyst with James Capel.
These would be the largest changes by far since those that flowed from the
government's 1989 'beer orders'. To an extent, they would also be the
settling of unfinished business from those directives.
Five years ago, the government tried to increase competition in the industry
by loosening the tie between brewers and the pubs that formed a large part
of brewers' retail distribution system.
Some companies, such as Grand Metropolitan and Boddington, got out of
brewing to focus on retailing. Others transferred their brewing to joint
ventures to try to increase their heft. Allied Domecq, for example, joined
with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, to create Carlsberg-Tetley.
For all the shuffling of assets, the industry was left suffering. Beer
consumption is in long term decline, with an ageing population switching
some of its spending to other drinks, or at least to imported premium
lagers. Some 25 per cent of brewing capacity is excess to demand.
On the retail side, pessimists estimate that Britain has about 10,000 more
pubs than drinking habits can support. The result is too many low-quality
and uninviting places which make consumers even more inclined to drink at
home. The off-trade accounts for about 24 per cent of total beer sales, and
is gaining about 1 per cent a year from the on-trade.
These unfavourable dynamics have left some companies as uncertain holders of
brewing or pub assets. GrandMet is seeking a way out from IEL, its pubs
joint venture with Foster's, the Australian brewer. Allied Domecq may want
to quit brewing to focus on spirits. Whitbread is trying to work out whether
to plunge into retailing and give up brewing, or to build a twin future on
both.
The linchpin is Foster's, owner of Courage, the second largest UK brewer
with a 19 per cent share compared to Bass's market leading 23 per cent. It
indicated at its recent annual meeting that it hoped to complete before
Christmas its review of its British brewing and pub businesses.
Any deal it subsequently decides to do would most likely happen next year.
Some analysts believe, though, that GrandMet and Foster's might try to
resolve their ownership of IEL before this year-end.
If Foster's decides to sell Courage, the price tag could be about Pounds
400m. Among potential British buyers, the most likely are Scottish &amp;
Newcastle and Whitbread, ranked joint fourth with 13 per cent each.
Courage would give S&amp;N a southern base, and make it a truly national brewer.
Conversely, Courage's northern breweries would extend Whitbread's product
range and geographic reach. In an ideal world they might want to split
Courage between them, but that would be a difficult deal to engineer.
For whoever buys Courage, the real pain will come in leading the industry's
rationalisation of production. But the cost of this and other changes will
be borne by many. The results season will give some indication of the
companies best able to seize the opportunities ahead and pay for them.

FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Solid sales growth lifts Astra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A strong rise in sales enabled Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, to
lift pre-tax profits by 25 per cent to SKr7.2bn (Dollars 985m) in the first
nine months.
Sales of the group's two main drugs, Losec and Pulmicort, rose faster than
the market average, enabling it to maintain the growth record which has made
it Sweden's top company by market capitalisation.
It said the favourable earnings trend would continue in the final quarter,
although not at the same rate as last year because of a less favourable
currency impact. Its A shares rose SKr1 to close at SKr193.
Underlying sales were 22 per cent higher at SKr20.06bn, well ahead of
estimated market growth of around 4 per cent.
Although operating profits were up 40 per cent at SKr6.95bn, a sharp drop in
financial income to SKr265m from SKr747m held back the performance at the
pre-tax level. The group has been hit by up to SKr200m in unrealised bond
losses.
Losec, Astra's blockbuster anti-ulcer drug, lifted sales by 36 per cent to
SKr6.87bn, against estimated market growth of 10 per cent. Including sales
through licensees, sales reached SKr12.9bn. Losec, the world's second best
selling drug worldwide after Glaxo's Zantac, received regulatory approval in
the third quarter for long-term therapy in Australia, Finland and Canada.
There was also a strong performance from the anti-asthma drug, Pulmicort,
where sales rose 19 per cent to SKr2.69bn.
Astra last week agreed to pay Dollars 820m to US drugs group Merck for a 50
per cent stake in a new venture that will market Losec and other Astra
products.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: NW Water considers customer rebates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water yesterday joined the growing band of water companies
seeking to address the sector's tarnished public image by indicating it was
considering customer rebates on water bills.
Any such move would be more than a year away, however, as rebates would
depend on North West beating operating efficiency targets set by the
industry regulator in the recent price review.
The indications came in a long-awaited operational review by the new chief
executive, Mr Brian Staples, who joined the privatised utility in March from
Tarmac, the construction group.
Mr Staples yesterday criticised the water sector for giving too many of the
'benefits of outperformance to shareholders and to the balance sheet' during
the first five years of privatisation. 'The companies have not done enough
to recognise customers,' he said.
North West intended to redress the balance initially by investing half the
Pounds 230m savings it expected to achieve on capital investment in issues
such as foul flooding of customers homes. Shareholders would not be ignored,
either. North West said it was confident of surpassing the 5.3 per cent real
dividend growth it had achieved since 1989. However, the company would not
be drawn into a dividend race, said Mr Staples.
Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of brokers NatWest Securities estimates that North
West will achieve average dividend growth above inflation of between 6 and 7
per cent.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe extends offer for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday extended its offer for VSEL, the nuclear
submarine maker, after attracting acceptances of just 0.4 per cent of the
shares, writes Richard Wolffe.
BAe's offer of 2.747 shares for each VSEL share, and its cash alternative of
Pounds 11.40, were accepted by shareholders representing a total of 165,645
shares.
More than 115,000 shares came from VSEL directors, who have made irrevocable
undertakings to accept BAe.
BAe said its offer would remain open until November 24, but closed the cash
alternative. Its own shares rose 4p to 461p yesterday, increasing the value
of its offer to Pounds 12.66 per share.
VSEL shares added 5p to Pounds 13.73. GEC's cash offer, which was launched
two weeks after BAe's bid, stands at Pounds 14 a share.
Mr Den Dover, Conservative MP for Chorley, yesterday called for GEC's bid to
be referred to the MMC. He said MPs were concerned that GEC's bid was 'only
a springboard' for a bid for BAe, which could give GEC control of the UK
defence industry.

FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese broker hit by one-off
Y32bn loss
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tokyo Securities, a medium-sized stockbroker, yesterday announced it had
incurred an extraordinary loss of Y32bn (Dollars 326.4m) in unauthorised US
bond and currency transactions by one of its senior traders. The company
will report the loss across both halves of the current fiscal year which
ends next March.
The loss is almost as large as the brokerage's entire annual operating
revenues, which will reach Y33bn for the current fiscal year.
Last month, Tokyo Securities reported a first-half loss after tax of Y2.5bn,
on very thin equity trading volumes. That figure will now be revised down to
Y16.6bn. For the current full year, the company forecasts after-tax losses
of Y32.5bn, compared with last month's forecast profit of Y1.1bn, and 1993's
actual profit of Y1.3bn.
Tokyo Securities said the trader, who was not named, had acted beyond his
authority and taken significant positions in US bonds and currencies, and
was personally responsible for the loss. It said he would be punished
according to internal company rules.
The brokerage had net assets in March this year of Y94bn, and shareholders'
capital of Y86bn. It has branches in New York, Hong Kong, London and Zurich.
More than a quarter of its shares are owned by companies linked with Nikko
Securities, one of Japan's four largest brokerages.

<TEXT>
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second largest bank, suffered a 24.5 per
cent slide in pre-tax profits to Sch1.04bn (Dollars 96.3m) in the third
quarter. It blamed the continuing slump in earnings from trading.
The bank, which is awaiting Austrian government approval of a plan to
complete its privatisation, reiterated that pre-tax profits in the full year
would be lower than last year's record Sch5.4bn. Net income would be higher
because of lower provisions for bad loans.
Income from trading in the third quarter, at Sch400m, was 42 per cent down.
The bank said income from money market operations and bond trading were
below expectations.
Net interest income, which was down 3.7 per cent in the first half, resumed
a modest growth trend in the third quarter, up 2.9 per cent to Sch2.19bn.
Fee income of Sch680m was 6.8 per cent ahead.
For the nine months, pre-tax profits were down 19.8 per cent to Sch2.9bn.
Consolidated pre-tax profits of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein group were down
20 per cent to Sch3.4bn.

FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan's carmakers begin recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's carmakers are seeing a fragile recovery in domestic demand,
demonstrated in half-year results published yesterday, and are confident of
continuing,stronger demand in the second half.
Non-consolidated results from Mitsubishi Motors, Mazda and Fuji Heavy
Industries - which makes Subaru cars - reflected the varying degrees to
which vehicle producers have been able to take advantage of a recovery in
the Japanese market.
Mitsubishi Motors, which has benefited tremendously from the popularity of
its recreational vehicles, achieved a 20 per cent increase in operating
profit, to Y22.9bn (Dollars 233.7m) from Y19.2bn a year ago, on flat sales
of Y1,225.2bn compared with Y1,216.7bn.
Recurring profits, however, were up only 1 per cent at Y17.4bn from Y17.2bn,
mainly as a result of lower non-operating income, such as interest payments.
Net profit was 19 per cent down at Y8.1bn from Y10bn because of higher
taxes. The interim dividend was held at Y3.5 a share.
The company expects the domestic recovery to continue, and for the full year
is forecasting increased revenues of Y2,620bn, higher recurring profits of
Y45bn and net profits of Y18bn.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent-owned by Ford of the US, on the other hand,
suffered recurring losses of Y28.6bn, which was approaching double the
Y15.5bn loss it incurred in the same period last year.
Sales at Mazda, which has been slow to take advantage of Japan's boom in
recreational vehicles, were down 2 per cent to Y858.9bn from Y876.1bn. Net
losses widened to Y28.9bn from Y15.8bn. It blamed the overall decline in
sales mainly to sluggish demand in the Japanese passenger car market in the
first part of the half.
However, Mazda, which relies on exports for 58 per cent of sales, was also
hit by the downturn in European sales, which offset a strong increase in
shipments to the US.
On the brighter side, the company began to benefit from the launch during
the period of its new Familia and Capella models, which have helped boost
sales. The Familia, in particular, has been popular for its low sticker
price of under Y1m for some versions.
Mazda is also undergoing a rationalisation exercise which enabled it to
reduce fixed costs by Y19bn in the first half. It believes its restructuring
programme, and the continuation the Japanese recovery, will enable it to
reduce losses in the second half and return to profitability in the next
fiscal year.
The company is forecasting increased sales of Y1,790bn against last year's
Y1,768.7bn, lower recurring losses of Y33bn compared with Y44.1bn and a net
loss of Y33bn, down from Y44.2bn.
Fuji Heavy Industries, noted for its four-wheel-drive cars and a popular
estate car, Legacy, increased sales strongly. However, it suffered a
downturn in non-operating profits, which put pressure on its performance at
the recurring level.
Fuji Heavy reported a recurring loss of Y2.3bn, down from a Y19bn loss, in
spite of a 13 per cent rise in sales to Y402.9bn compared with Y356.6bn.
There was also a return to the black at the operating level, with Y2.5bn in
operating profits against a Y15.8bn loss. The company passed its interim
dividend.
For the full year, Fuji expects sales of Y830bn, recurring profits of Y3bn
and net profits of Y3bn.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Warning lops 24p off Metrotect share price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Metrotect Industries, which manufactures products to prevent
corrosion in pipelines, tumbled 24p to 80p after the anticipated jump in
first half profits was accompanied by a profits warning.
Mr Brian Thomas, chairman, said that unforeseen project delays would result
in a modest third quarter. The outcome for the full year was likely to fall
below the Pounds 2.36m reported for the 12 months to March 31, he added.
Nevertheless, he sounded an optimistic note: 'International pipeline
forecasts continue to run at a high level in areas where we enjoy a strong
presence and prospects remain good.'
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 559,000 to Pounds 801,000 in the six months
to September 30, the 43 per cent advance being achieved on turnover ahead 25
per cent to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 8.28m).
About 90 per cent of sales are exported to more than 20 countries, with main
markets including Thailand, India, Brazil, Indonesia and Iran.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.15p, twice covered by earnings of
2.33p (1.49p) per share.

FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Old image still hangs heavy on
slimmer Sears - Laurie Morse reports on the transformation of the troubled
US retail group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's decision by Sears, Roebuck, the US department store group, to
spin off its Allstate insurance subsidiary to shareholders not only takes
the company back to its retailing roots, but completes a reorganisation that
ranks among the biggest in US corporate history.
The revamping was initiated in 1992 by Mr Edward Brennan, chairman and chief
executive. In the two years since, the company has divested its Dean Witter
securities arm, its Discover credit card operations, its mortgage banking
business and its real estate group. Earlier this week, the company even
announced that it was giving up ownership of the Sears Tower in Chicago, the
world's tallest building.
The reorganisation will also see the departure of Mr Brennan himself. Now
60, he said he would retire after the Allstate spin-off has been completed
next year. He will hand over the slimmed-down Sears to Mr Arthur Martinez,
the 55-year-old former Saks Fifth Avenue executive brought in two years ago
to revitalise the ailing store operations.
The dismemberment of Sears may have been drastic, but for shareholders it
could not have come soon enough. Mr Brennan's predecessor, Mr Edward
Telling, had dreamed of transforming Sears by turning it into a 'socks and
stocks' operation that sold financial services alongside hosiery, but the
idea never really caught on. Although the financial service businesses
performed well, the retail operations began to sag: by the time Mr Brennan
took over in 1986, shareholders were demanding a break-up.
When Mr Martinez becomes chairman next year, he will inherit a company with
740 department and specialty stores, a small property development company
called Homart, and part ownership in Prodigy, an on-line computer service.
The difficulty he faces is simple: the shopper of the 1990s is less than
impressed when offered the services of a 1950s-style department store.
In the 1970s, Sears was the world's biggest retailer. Today, it still has
loyal customers for its power tools, lawnmowers and washing machines.
However, distracted by its adventures in financial services and left behind
by changes in retailing, it has slipped into third place behind Wal-Mart
Stores and Kmart, the huge US discount store groups.
When Mr Martinez was made chief of Sears's merchandising group, he wielded
the knife early and often. He dropped the loss-making catalogue operations
on which the Sears empire had been founded; he closed 113 unprofitable
stores; he reorganised an unwieldly and dated buying organisation; and he
axed nearly 50,000 jobs. He then embarked on a five-year, Dollars 4bn
repositioning programme aimed at refurbishing stores, boosting sales of
high-margin clothing and accessory lines, and creating a more glamorous
image.
The results have begun to show. After recording net losses of Dollars 3.9bn
in 1992 - a year in which profits were hit by a Dollars 3.1bn restructuring
charge and insurance losses from Hurricane Andrew - Sears made record net
profits of Dollars 2.4bn last year. The merchandising group has had seven
consecutive profitable quarters, posting Dollars 890m in nine-month
operating income this year, up 37 per cent from last year's Dollars 632m.
Growth in same-store sales outperformed the industry average last year and
has continued to do so this year, albeit by a narrower margin. Last month,
sales were 7 per cent higher than in October 1993 - itself a strong month.
However, Sears has a long way to go. Even with Mr Martinez's direction,
industry analysts say it lacks the strategy to turn a dowdy retailer into a
trend-setter. Despite drastic cost-cutting and the advantage that most of
its stores are debt-free, its profitability lags its competition. In the
third quarter, its costs, at 26.3 cents per dollar of sales, were 20 per
cent higher than other mid-price department stores.
To narrow the cost gap, Sears will make more use of its floorspace, adding
the equivalent of about 100 new stores over the next two years by converting
administrative offices in its existing properties into sales floors.
Cost-cutting will add value to the department store, but the second part of
Mr Martinez's plan - to recapture the market for high-margin women's
clothing - has not yet produced the required result.
Observing that Sears had once been successful because it offered an array of
dependable products to middle America when there were few shopping choices,
Mr Phil Johnson, president of Leo Shapiro and Associates, a Chicago-based
retail consulting firm says: 'From a consumer perspective, nobody needs
Sears any more. High-quality products are available everywhere, and wealthy
shoppers are mobile. They don't need everything in one place any more.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Banks invited to take part in electricity
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday began public preparations for the international
offer of its shares in National Power and PowerGen, the electricity
generators, by asking investment banks if they want to take part in the
distribution.
The Treasury wrote to the banks saying it would choose four or five global
managers to work with Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Kleinwort Benson, who are
advising the government on the flotation and acting as global co-ordinators.
There will also be 10 regional managers.
The decision to choose up to five global managers follows a report by the
National Audit Office on the last sale of government shares in BT. This
pointed out that although there were 11 global managers for the BT sale,
most of the shares were distributed by a small number of banks.
The international offer will be to UK institutions as well as overseas
institutions and individuals. Banks interested in taking part in the retail
sale, to private investors in the UK, have already been briefed on
arrangements for the flotation.
The government is selling its remaining 40 per cent stakes in the two
companies. Marketing will start in January for a sale in February.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Unilever up 6.4% at 9 months - Sales surge
in ice cream and iced tea but detergents decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in sales of ice cream and iced tea, plus a more favourable economic
environment around the world, helped Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products group, raise third quarter pre-tax profits by 11 per cent from
Pounds 651m to Pounds 724m.
The result slightly exceeded market forecasts and marked an acceleration in
the rate of profit growth. Profits for the nine months to September 30 were
up 6.4 per cent at Pounds 1.78bn (Pounds 1.68bn) compared with a 3 per cent
rise at the half year.
Ice cream benefited from a hot summer in Europe, where Unilever has about 40
per cent of the market, and from the inclusion of Breyers, the US maker
acquired at the end of last year.
Ice cream plus other strongly growing products such as speciality chemicals
and personal products compensated for a decline in detergents where profits
fell despite heavy cost cutting. Unilever declined to disclose exact figures
but said 'negative publicity had had an undeniable impact'.
Unilever had high hopes this spring when it launched Persil Power detergent
in the UK and Omo Power on the Continent. But a flaw in the products was
exploited by Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's rival, through a hard-hitting
media campaign.
Market shares of the Power detergents have fallen from launch levels in the
UK and the Netherlands, where the campaign was strongest, but were up 30 per
cent in France where consumers were unmoved by the campaign, Unilever said.
The group said it had raised promotional spending in an effort to rebuild
Power sales. Sales of its other detergents had risen.
A rationalisation in its North American detergent business helped halt the
decline in market share, Sir Michael Perry, chairman, said. Consumer
products generally were ahead in North America, pushing third quarter
operating profits in the region up 29 per cent to Pounds 155m (Pounds 120m)
on sales ahead 4 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn (Pounds 1.48m).
European operating profits were ahead 12 per cent to Pounds 452m (Pounds
403m) on sales up 7.5 per cent to Pounds 4.2bn (Pounds 3.9bn). The rest of
the world rose 10 per cent to Pounds 169m (Pounds 153m) on sales 18 per cent
higher at Pounds 2.01bn (Pounds 1.7bn).
Interest rose from Pounds 45m to Pounds 60m in the quarter as net debt rose
to Pounds 1.9bn at September 30 from Pounds 1.5bn a year earlier.
The UK interim dividend is raised by 7 per cent to 6.51p (6.08p). The Dutch
dividend was held at Fl 1.48. Third quarter earnings per share rose to
24.09p (21.94p) giving 60.22p (58.32p) for the nine months.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Dalgety sells US business for Dollars 138m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group which is focusing on its pet
food and food ingredients divisions, yesterday sold part of its US food
distribution business for Dollars 138m (Pounds 86m) cash.
The buyer is ProSource, a distribution subsidiary of Onex Corporation, an
Ontario-based investment company. ProSource, which already serves 5,000
restaurants, is acquiring the National Accounts division of Martin-Brower,
one of the biggest food distribution companies in North America.
Dalgety will realise Dollars 47m after discharging liabilities of Dollars
91m. It will use the money to reduce its borrowings, which rose sharply to
Pounds 127m at the end of June.
Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive, said the group was retaining the
McDonald's side of Martin-Brower, which accounts for 60 per cent of the
business. 'This is very much a specialised service for McDonald's', he said,
adding that each year it delivered 120m cases of goods, including food,
packaging and cleaning materials, to more than 4,000 restaurants.
National Accounts carries out much the same service, but to 10 smaller
restaurant chains. In the year to June, National, which has net assets of
Dollars 32m, made profits of Dollars 6.3m on sales of just over Dollars 2bn.
Mr David Parker, ProSource chairman, said that the acquisition would
strengthen joint capabilities in the Dollars 124bn-a-year US food
distribution industry.
Last September Dalgety reported that operating profits from US food
distribution were 15 per cent up at Pounds 16.4m, benefiting from higher
sales to McDonald's and other customers. Mr Clothier said the disposal would
be only marginally dilutive of earnings.
Since the financial year end Dalgety has sold its Dutch savoury snack
business to United Biscuits for Pounds 21m and bought two Spanish pet food
companies for Pounds 17m.
It was interested in buying DCA, Allied Domecq's food ingredients subsidiary
which was sold on Monday to Kerry, the Irish food group, for Pounds 265m. Mr
Clothier said Dalgety was unwilling to match Kerry's offer.
If there are no further deals, Dalgety expects gearing at the end of the
current financial year to be below 20 per cent, down from 33 per cent at the
end of June.
At the annual meeting yesterday, Dalgety reduced the employment contracts of
the executive directors from three year to two year rolling notice periods.
Mr Clothier said: 'We as directors were willing to acknowledge that three
years did seem unnecessarily long. We have respected the viewsof a number of
shareholders.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods launches last ditch defence to BFI
bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste services company, yesterday put itself on the block
in a last ditch attempt to fend off the hostile Pounds 364m cash bid from
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US.
In a style of bid defence more familiar in the US than the UK, Attwoods
pledged to sell its British and mainland European operations if shareholders
rejected the BFI bid. It would then seek a buyer or potential merger partner
for the US assets. The disposals were expected to be completed by the middle
of 1995.
Attwoods said yesterday these actions would realise more value for
shareholders than the 109p a share on offer from BFI.
Investors would receive a cash payment when the UK and European businesses
were sold, which could range from 24p to 46p a share. This was based on
estimates of net disposal proceeds of between Pounds 69m and Pounds 129m,
after paying Pounds 81m in debt and preference shares. They would then have
the option of cash or shares in the new vehicle to be created through the
sale or merger of the US businesses.
Attwoods said it was in discussions with several potential unidentified
purchasers. Speculation centred on Waste Management International, the UK
quoted arm of WMX of the US, as a possible buyer in the UK.
In the US, Attwoods is expected to explore merger opportunities with
middle-ranking waste companies, such as Sanifill and United Waste.
Although Attwoods was confident that appropriate sale proceeds would be
achieved, it said it could not make a formal estimate while the bid
continued. Attwoods also said it would not make the disposals if it could
not 'achieve proper value for shareholders'.
BFI attacked this caveat as the 'clearest indication' that shareholders
should accept the bid. 'When the bid pressure goes away, they will not do
it,' said an adviser.
BFI is expected to indicate by the middle of next week whether or not it
will revise its offer. Last night the company was adamant that 109p was a
'full and fair price'.
Investors are less convinced, however. They are thought to be pressing for
concessions in the structure of the bid - such as an equity sweetener - in
the price, or in the amount BFI has promised to return to investors with the
sale of Attwoods' German operations.
'We do not think this current bid is acceptable,' said one shareholder.
Attwoods shares closed 1p up at 115p.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr board casts doubt on voting strength
of rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The family feud at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust intensified yesterday as the
board of the motor and leisure group cast doubt on the power of the rebel
shareholders.
The board claimed that the rebels, led by Nicholas and Robert Barr, have
overstated their control of ordinary voting shares, some of which are held
in trusts.
The Barr brothers say they control almost 30 per cent of ordinary shares,
and claim support from shareholders owning another 20 per cent of voting
shares, including Mr Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman.
It emerged yesterday that the Takeover Panel had interviewed the Barr
brothers and Mr Firth last week.
The brothers are calling for their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, who owns 16 per
cent of the ordinary shares, to step down as chairman. They have also
requisitioned an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian
Small, finance director.
However, in a statement yesterday the board said it had 'substantive grounds
for doubting whether Nicholas and Robert Barr had unfettered control over
the exercise of voting rights for all the ordinary shares in their stated
shareholdings'.
The board has called a further EGM, to be held before the rebels' meeting,
to enfranchise the non-voting A shares which are held almost entirely by
institutions.
It needs 75 per cent support among voting shareholders to succeed with
enfranchise-ment, which would reduce family control from 55 to 18 per cent.
A representative for the brothers said: 'We dismiss this latest pathetic
salvo from the board with the contempt it deserves.
'We are confident that with our votes and the votes of our supporters that
we can easily defeat the board's proposal for enfranchisement and carry the
day not only then, but at the EGM the company has requisitioned on our own
proposals.'
On Wednesday the board warned that the motor side of the business could lose
its distribution franchises if the rebels win control.
The brothers, who are the sons of the late managing director, Mr Stuart
Barr, plan to run the group's two divisions as stand-alone businesses.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad moves to bypass high street
retailers in sale of PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, is to sell
Amstrad-branded personal computers and facsimile machines at cut-down prices
direct to customers - bypassing high street retailers.
The group, which pioneered PC sales in the UK high street in the mid-1980s,
has been forced to withdraw from the retail store market because of fierce
competition and tumbling margins.
Mr Sugar acknowledged yesterday that Amstrad had faced a stark choice. 'It
was either throw away all we have created or launch this direct sales
programme,' he said.
Direct PC sales have grown rapidly in recent years and now account for about
500,000 units a year, or about 36 per cent of the UK market, according to
Romtec, the market research organisation.
Although there are signs that direct market sales growth may now be slowing,
Mr Sugar expressed confidence yesterday that Amstrad's strong brand name
would help it gain a significant share of the market.
Direct PC sales in the UK are currently dominated by Dell, Elonex and
Viglen, the direct PC manufacturer which Amstrad acquired in July. Viglen
will continue to sell its own branded PCs, but will concentrate mainly on
large corporate and institutional buyers.
Amstrad's direct PC and fax sales will be handled by a new unit, Amstrad
Business Direct, which plans to sell the machines mainly to first-time
buyers using magazine advertisements and telephone sales. Amstrad is relying
on a Pounds 1m pre-Christmas advertising campaign to boost sales.
The move, which had been widely foreshadowed, is part of a reorganisation
being undertaken by Mr David Rogers, the new chief executive.
The shares rose 1/2 p to 29p.

FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JJB Sports to float with Pounds 64.5m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JJB Sports, the UK's largest independent sports retailer, yesterday
finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 215p to give it a market
capitalisation of Pounds 64.5m.
Mr David Whelan, the former Blackburn Rovers player who broke his leg in the
1960 FA cup final, founded the chain in Wigan in 1971.
Mr Whelan, who began his business career with Pounds 400 raised by benefit
matches, and his family interests is selling 6.2m shares, raising more than
Pounds 13m.
A total of 10.5m ordinary shares, or 35 per cent of the enlarged share
capital, have been placed with institutions and other investors by
Charterhouse Tilney. The company is raising Pounds 8.6m of new money, net of
expenses, from the sale of 4.28m new shares.
Mr Whelan said yesterday that the group would be spending Pounds 4m on a new
100,000 sq ft warehouse in Wigan, to be built next year, and Pounds 4.5m on
opening another 30 stores.
The group, which will have more than 120 outlets by the end of this year,
concentrates on providing kit and equipment for all active sports. It
stresses that it is not in the fashion end of the market.
Operating profits of not less than Pounds 6.5m are forecast for the year to
January 31 1995. Last year it made Pounds 4.7m on turnover of Pounds 41.2m.
Forecast earnings of 16.35p put the group on a multiple of just over 13. The
notional net dividend is 6p, giving a notional gross yield of 3.5 per cent.
Dealings are expected to begin next Friday.

8) on duties and remuneration of non-executive directors. A rate of Pounds
15,000-Pounds 20,000 for 100 days' work a year seems fair reward for 10
hours a week. However, it is often the case that directors have several
non-executive appointments as well as a full-time one. Does Ms Kingsmill
suggest that persons with six part-time and one full-time directorship are
willing, and capable, of putting in 100 hours a week and, more to the point,
what kind of value can shareholders expect from such overworked directors?

FT  12 NOV 94 / Signal out of the blue: The US move to opt out of the arms
embargo against Bosnia has strained the transatlantic bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a few days before a landmark meeting of nine European nations on
greater self-sufficiency in defence, the US has startled its allies with a
change of policy over Bosnia.
The US decision to end enforcement of the international arms embargo against
Bosnia was bound, under a congressional mandate, to be announced by November
15, and its practical consequences may prove to be manageable. British
ships, such as the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible, are understood to have
been fitted with high technology control systems, which could make it
possible for them to take over part of the co-ordinating role currently
played by the US in the Adriatic.
But the US move's timing and presentation - described as 'breath-taking' by
one senior European official - have given a new sharpness to the debate
about the future of transatlantic co-operation in foreign affairs and
defence.
As European observers see it, the White House would have found a sympathetic
response if it had quietly warned its allies of the impending decision and
sought to limit the diplomatic fall-out.
British and French officials have shown some understanding for the US
administration's dilemma as it weaves its way between the pro-Bosnian lobby
in Congress, and the concerns of European allies, who fear a conflagration
in the Balkans.
But from the European perspective, any hopes that transatlantic differences
could be finessed have been disappointed.
Word of the US move reached Europe 'out of the blue' through an article in
the US press and comments by unnamed officials accompanying President Bill
Clinton to a conference in Jakarta.
It has been received in Europe as the wrong signal, at the wrong time: both
to the warring parties in Bosnia, and to the European nations whose
peacekeeping forces and aid workers are acutely vulnerable to any further
flare-up in the fighting.
'This is not a helpful move,' said a British Foreign Office spokesman, with
the practised understatement of his trade.
Mr David Clark, defence spokesman for the British Labour party, was blunter.
'This promises a dangerous escalation of the Bosnian conflict,' he said. 'It
is like pouring oil on to a burning fire.'
Mr Clark's conclusion that 'the American action reveals the need to enhance
Europe's own defence effort' will be echoed by many European politicians.
Officially, the 'contact group' on Bosnia - comprising the US, Russia,
Britain, France and Germany - is still on the road, and will plod onwards
with its efforts to present the Serbs, Croats and Moslems with a joint
position.
In recent weeks, the group has been haggling over a package of incentives
that might be offered to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic if he agrees
to recognise Croatia and settle the armed stand-off there.
But it is already plain that the group - whose effectiveness depends on
unity - is fundamentally divided.
The US believes the refusal by the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international
peace plan is a sufficient ground for authorising the open supply of arms to
their Moslem and Croat enemies.
The British, French and Russians disagree: they believe that diplomatic and
economic isolation - by the entire outside world, including Serbia  -
represents the best hope of forcing the Bosnian Serbs into a more reasonable
stance.
This transatlantic spat is made far more significant by its timing, just
three days before a meeting in the Netherlands of the Western European
Union.
Until recently a Sleeping Beauty of international diplomacy, the WEU is
experiencing a revival. There are policy-makers and diplomats who argue that
this is in the interests of both Europe and America and implies no
diminution in the warmth of political ties across the Atlantic.
They argue as follows: the end of the cold war, and US budget constraints,
make America less willing to commit men and armour to Europe. However, the
Europeans remain dependent on the US for the assets that make it possible to
deploy troops at short notice: air and sea transport, electronic
intelligence and command systems.
It is, therefore, logical to construct a new model for military missions
launched from Europe: the Europeans will provide the men and basic hardware,
while borrowing strategic assets from the US.
This argument holds good as long as the strategic interests of the US and
Western Europe are virtually identical.
But if they diverge, this endlessly discussed model - known by the horrible
acronym of Combined Joint Task Force - seems unlikely ever to come into
being.
Yet the only alternative to co-operation with America is for Europe to spend
enormous sums developing its own strategic military assets: a prospect that
would fill European finance ministers, and taxpayers, with horror.
It is still too early to say how deep a split in strategic interest the
US-European dispute over Bosnia reflects. It could ultimately prove to be
the kind of passing squabble that often arises between ground commanders and
air chiefs fighting the same war.
Both western Europe and the US are weighing up the same factors in
formulating their policy towards Bosnia. They want to prevent a wider war in
the Balkans and beyond; maintain the west's credibility in the eyes of its
friends in the Moslem world; and avoid a rupture in relations with Russia.
However, the relative importance of these factors looks different from
different sides of the Atlantic.
America has been more vulnerable to pressure from pro-western Moslem
nations, perhaps because grass-roots opinion in countries such as Egypt and
Pakistan is particularly sensitive to US behaviour.
Europeans, for their part, have been more dubious than the US about the
feasibility, and desirability, of isolating Serbia for an indefinite period.
They fear that this approach could ultimately drive the most powerful nation
in former Yugoslavia into the hands of a chauvinist Russia.
So there are, to put it mildly, differences of emphasis in the US and west
European approaches to the Bosnian war.
Officials on both sides of the Atlantic agree that the significance of these
differences is far outweighed by a broader need to maintain the
transatlantic relationship. The price of failure, it is widely acknowledged,
could be a disorderly 'renationalisation' of the defence policies of the
leading western nations, with each one pursuing its own agenda.
In December, the US, Canada and all European states including Russia are due
to confer in Budapest on the prospects for a new security order stretching
from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Diplomats may have to work hard to prevent
the Bosnian dispute overshadowing this meeting and turning it into a fiasco.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Markets move with due understanding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICK PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, November 3) neatly summarises the
problems the UK monetary authorities face in looking at a multitude of
economic signals, not all of which are flashing the same colour at the same
time.
But his comment that 'the financial markets did not immediately realise the
Bank was trying to signal the need for a bias towards higher interest rates'
is simply wrong.
As far as changes in interest rates are concerned, the markets are concerned
with three simple factors: direction, timing and size. I know of no one who
is forecasting the next move in base rates to be down. Indeed, the short
sterling futures market immediately prior to the inflation report was
discounting UK interest rates of 8.5 per cent by next September.
The sharp rally in the markets was not due to any misinterpretation of the
direction, nor the timing of future base rate changes. Rather, on the basis
of a swift and detailed reading of the report itself - rather than the
off-the-record briefing given exclusively to journalists - the market
concluded that the size of the rate rises would be less than previously
expected.
It is easy to criticise financial markets. It is easier still to mock their
'ex-post rationalisation' of news and events. But, in this particular case,
the market reaction was correct. Interest rates are going up, whether this
week, next week, next month or next year. The sharp rally since publication
of the inflation report came not because the market misunderstood the Bank
of England, but because it understood it all too well.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fly me - but do not expect an upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms KIM FAIRWEATHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I found Michael Holman's advice in his article, 'Tradecraft of the
frequent flyer' (October 24), amusing and, from what I've heard of Nigeria,
well worth heeding. But there is one point which he, for obvious reasons,
overlooked, and that is the other type of traveller who, in my experience,
is not offered up-grades - women. I am a Silver member of BA's
frequent-flyer programme, but I have yet to have the word upgrade even
mentioned at check-in, let alone be offered one.
This was finally brought home to me when a male colleague, who had not flown
with BA for more than two years and is not known for his stylish dress
sense, recently checked in for a BA flight, and the assistant immediately
volunteered the likelihood that he would be upgraded.
Having flown BA regularly, since the days of BOAC, I have reached the
opinion that loyalty is a one-way street.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Ailing health scheme: Alan Pike and James Buxton on the
lessons of a flawed plan for a private hospital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly before it went into receivership this week, the Health Care
International private hospital at Clydebank announced plans for a conference
on the use of clinical information in management.
'Inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all,' the
conference promotional leaflet declared. 'Consequently, information
resources are central to business success.'
To the many sceptics who had always rejected the case for building a huge
Pounds 180m private hospital aimed at the overseas market on reclaimed
industrial land near Glasgow, Health Care International seemed to have
summed up its own plight. The hospital's financial backers - who included
the government with Pounds 30m of public funds - appeared to have acted on
inaccurate information when, in a vacuum, their instincts might have warned
them to beware.
The project was conceived ten years ago by US surgeons Dr Raphael Levey and
Dr Angelo Eraklis, from Harvard Medical School. Their idea was to provide
tertiary health care - serious operations for disorders such as cancer and
heart disease - for patients living in countries where good treatment was
hard to obtain. They identified Italy, Greece and the Middle East as
potential markets: a view confirmed in the late 1980s, but not
unequivocally, by Coopers &amp; Lybrand in studies commissioned by the Scottish
Development Agency.
The government committed Pounds 30m to the scheme, tied partly to the 1,800
direct jobs it was expected to create and Samuel Montagu in London and
Montgomery Medical Ventures of San Francisco completed the financing
arrangements in 1991. The project was made more dependent on borrowing with
the reversal by the Industrial Bank of Japan of its decision to invest
equity in HCI.
But even as the idea was being developed, European construction companies
were literally building a hole in the case in the form of new, well-equipped
local hospitals in the Middle East and elsewhere that reduced the need for
patients to travel to Europe or the US.
Overseas patients used to form a bigger part of the market for UK private
medicine than they do today, but fewer than 3 per cent of people admitted to
UK independent hospitals in 1992-1993 (excluding abortion cases) came from
overseas. They accounted for a greater proportion of revenue, since many
were suffering from complex conditions. Even so, the authoritative Laing's
Review of Private Healthcare estimates that overseas patients now account
for about 10 per cent of the private sector's total revenue.
Much of this goes to a handful of internationally famous London hospitals.
Health managers estimate that to succeed in the existing market, a hospital
the size of Clydebank would need to attract about one-third of all overseas
patients treated by the entire UK independent sector. The alternative was to
create a new market.
The scheme's backers argue that this was Clydebank's aim. Smaller private
hospitals cater largely for British patients seeking routine treatment
outside the NHS. HCI sought to provide the more sophisticated and complex
range of treatments offered by the central London independent hospitals, and
make it available to a wider overseas market.
In bed terms, Clydebank is almost as big as the NHS's specialist Royal
Brompton National Heart and Lung hospital in London. The Royal Brompton,
with five operating theatres, performed 2,700 operations last year.
Clydebank has 21 theatres to keep busy, but when the receivers were called
in on Wednesday, only 20 of the 50 beds commissioned were filled.
These were early days, says Dr Levey, for a hospital that only began
treating patients in March, and was not fully operational until June.
'The tragedy is,' he says, 'that in the last few days we had been achieving
a rate of admissions that would meet our targets and ensure our viability.
We had just signed conventions with three private Italian diagnostic centres
whose patients would be covered by private medical insurance.' Late last
month the hospital reached agreements with the authorities in Egypt and
Lebanon.
But time had run out. Negotiations had been going on since late summer
between HCI, its bankers and investors, about a financial restructuring, but
Credit Lyonnais, one of the five members of the banking consortium which had
lent HCI Pounds 80m, refused to advance any more money, precipitating
receivership.
The scheme had always been opposed by trade unions and the Labour Party in
Scotland, where the commitment to the NHS runs deep. The Independent
Healthcare Association, which represents the UK private sector, also
questioned the grandiose scheme's viability.
'The concept and scale of the project was unrealistic given the size of the
international market and competition around the world,' says Mr John Randle,
the association's chairman.
The scheme's promoters had also failed to sell the idea to IDA Ireland, the
Irish development agency. Talks lasted more than a year and the IDA says it
would have been prepared to back the scheme if it had been satisfied it was
viable. 'We kept asking the promoters for more information on potential
markets and financial viability,' said an IDA official this week. 'It never
reached the stage where we felt they had provided the information that would
have enabled us to agree to the project, and the talks eventually came to an
end.'
Even so, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, hopes it will be possible for the
hospital to be taken forward from receivership and survive. New investors
may be found - HCI hoped for more equity from the Abu Dhabi Investment
Authority, linked to a flow of patients from the emirate.
But for Mr Barry Hassell, chief executive of the Independent Healthcare
Association, the verdict is clear. 'I have visited the hospital and it is
splendid,' he says. 'The trouble is that it is too big, it is in the wrong
place, and it opened at the wrong time.'
HCI seems to fly in the face of the Whitehall adage that ministers should
never give money to someone who wants to manufacture square golfballs - even
if his business plan is flawless. If the scheme fails, the whole world will
remind you that golfballs are always round.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Funny old game, football: Nick Hornby argues that match
rigging allegations strike at the heart of soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK HORNBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the night of May 26 1989, Arsenal, my team, played Liverpool at Anfield
in the last game of that season's championship programme. Liverpool were top
of the English first division, and Arsenal were second. If, however, Arsenal
could win by two goals, then the positions would be reversed, and Arsenal
would win their first championship title for 18 years.
It was a tall order. Arsenal hadn't won at Anfield for nearly two decades,
and Liverpool only lost at home once every two or three seasons. They never
lost a game that really meant something.
Incredibly, however, Arsenal did it. With almost the last kick of the game,
a young Arsenal player called Michael Thomas beat Liverpool's goalkeeper
Bruce Grobbelaar to score the second goal that his team so desperately
needed, and Arsenal fans and players exploded with a jubilation that none of
us could have felt before or since.
Ambitions change and disappear as one gets older, but wanting Arsenal to win
the championship had remained a constant in my life throughout childhood and
adolescence and adulthood. Only in sport can ambitions be realised in a
split second, when all hope appears to have gone. That is one of sport's
glories.
Five years later, I still get goose pimples when I think about Michael
Thomas's goal, and I know that I am not the only one.
'You couldn't have scripted a moment like that,' journalists and
commentators said over and over again, with disbelieving shakes of the head.
'Nobody would believe it.'
But what if it had been scripted? What if at least one of the players on the
pitch knew the outcome of the game even before it had begun? There has been
no suggestion that this was one of the games Grobbelaar is alleged to have
'thrown', and it is unlikely that anyone would choose to influence the
result of such a high-profile game, if only because the legitimate rewards
on offer would outweigh any illegal inducements.
But how many football fans, on hearing this week's news, found themselves
thinking back to a night of glory or an afternoon of misery, and wondering
whether the subsequent depression or jubilation had been provoked, not by
the mystery and beauty of the game, but by the contents of a brown paper bag
in a hotel room?
A pundit suggested on TV one night this week that the accusations against
Grobbelaar were in a sense immaterial. Whatever the outcome, Grobbelaar, he
argued, was obviously an individual, isolated case, and football fans were
far more concerned about football's endemic corruption, the rake-offs and
tax fiddles and falsification of receipts.
That is nonsense. We know that football is a dirty sport; a big, almost
ungovernable business in which players that most people have never heard of
are sold for millions of pounds which we never see again. We know that dodgy
agents take huge cuts from huge salaries; that managers are offered
inducements to sell their best players; that serious money changes hands in
motorway service stations.
We know all this, and we don't care, really; we kid ourselves that much of
it is done for the good of the team.
If a club promises an interest-free loan to a player, and then conveniently
forgets to reclaim the money, it is only because the player will help shore
up a leaky defence, or end that chronic goal-scoring problem; we care only
about what happens on the pitch, about strikers and results and cups. But
once we begin to doubt that what we are seeing is real, then we will cease
to care - and without the caring, it is all over.
If Bruce Grobbelaar is guilty, it is difficult to see how the game will ever
fully recover. Already people are making other allegations, about other
players. It matters not at all whether these claims are true or false. It
only takes the proving of one allegation to leave us doubting what we see.
I was at last Sunday's Arsenal game, at which they drew 0-0 with Sheffield
Wednesday. I had a thoroughly miserable afternoon watching two poor teams
fail to produce so much as a shot on goal for long stretches of the match. I
came home frustrated and gloomy. Arsenal quite regularly draws nil-all, so I
was not suspicious in any way. In fact, it is hard to believe that anyone
with any kind of business sense would have paid my team not to score, since
they usually need no inducement of any kind to do this - one might as well
slip a cat a few quid to make it sleep in front of a fire.
But there was at least one small boy, the eight-year-old nephew of a friend,
who was visiting the Highbury ground for the first time last Sunday, and it
is unlikely that his interest would survive if he thought that players could
be paid not to play.
I stuck with football throughout the 1970s and early 1980s when large
numbers of people stopped attending games because they were afraid that they
might get beaten up. I was not deterred by the tragedy at the Heysel
stadium, nor by the subsequent ban on English clubs in European football,
nor by the Taylor Report, which has introduced all-seater stadiums and
changed the atmosphere beyond recognition.
I have never previously been able to imagine the circumstances in which I
would give up my season ticket and stay at home on Saturday afternoons, but
I can now. If it turns out that players who earn between Pounds 250,000 and
Pounds 500,000 a year just from their on-field activities have been taking
bribes, then we might as well all watch wrestling instead, because at least
we know that wrestling is pure theatre. Only the very, very stupid would get
goose-pimples from Hulk Hogan's performances; at the moment, it is every
football fan's fear that we have been doing exactly that.

<TEXT>
Sir, I have spent months trying to establish the optimum level of investment
for my company, so imagine my excitement at reading that my work is over -
the government has the answer. I, with every other business, should invest
more ('Businesses must expect less and invest more, Heseltine tells CBI',
November 8).
Call me gullible, but I immediately engaged a pantechnicon to call at the
department of industry. I knew a large vehicle would be needed for the
department's research on my company's investment, my own investigations
occupying yards of shelf.
It was with disbelief that I found there was nothing to collect. Apparently
politicians and civil servants are able to make judgments without research.
Their grounds are that companies respond to market signals, while government
direction is far above this.
Curiously, when I asked how often the department was perturbed by
over-investment I met with silence. Peter Krafft,

FT  12 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU border restrictions on agriculture
should end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ALLAN BUCKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sure that David Richardson is right (Farmer's Viewpoint, November
8) to point out the many problems facing agriculture in central and eastern
Europe (CEE).
To pick up just one of the factors at the root of the production problem:
unfinished land reform is indeed creating a more fragmented ownership
structure in many countries. This does not necessarily result in a
fragmented operational structure - that depends on the flexibility of the
rental market for land. While informal rental arrangements are becoming
increasingly common, it will take many more years to sort out these
institutional matters.
Thus, the much-feared threat to agriculture in the European Union from
eastern Europe is certainly many years down the road. But this is not just a
matter of supply conditions in CEE, it is also dependent on the trading
relationship we offer them.
The earliest we could expect accession of the new applicant countries (and
thus their opportunity to benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy in the
single market) is at beginning of the next century. They pose little threat
to EU agriculture in the interim because of our impervious borders secured
by the agricultural provisions of the association agreements. Since 1990,
the EU agricultural trade balance with the six associated countries has
reversed in our favour.
So put the Richardson hypothesis to the test. If we have nothing to fear
from eastern Europe, let's dismantle EU border restrictions on agriculture
with these countries. Can we expect Richardson, his German friend, Mr Graf
Grote, and the National Farmers' Union, who apparently share his view, to
add their weight to those voices who advocate a more open trade stance on
agriculture with eastern Europe?

FT  12 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Not just the economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US electorate said two things loudly on Tuesday: 'it's not the economy,
stupid' and 'not the Democrats, stupid.' The question is what these
statements mean, since the US electorate has, like most oracles, spoken
ambiguously.
It is tempting to argue that what happens in the US has no bearing on
politics elsewhere. The constitutional framework, institutions and political
issues are, after all, so distinct. Where else can politicians be pitched
out for voting against the citizen's right to own assault rifles? Where
else, for that matter, do voters insist on children being taught that God
created the universe a few thousand years ago, along with evidence
suggesting it was really several billion more.
However barmy US politics sometimes seem to outsiders, it would be wrong to
ignore the lessons altogether. What is interesting about these elections is
that the electorate's reaction to economic insecurity is to become more
conservative.
The lack of a political dividend from the recovery is surprising. Elected
when the economic tide was gaining strength, but before that strength had
become obvious, President Clinton has watched the economy deliver all he
could have hoped for. Gross domestic product rose 3.1 per cent in 1993 and
is forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow another 3.7 per cent
in 1994. Inflation is securely under control. Unemployment is already less
than 6 per cent, close to full employment on most economists' estimates.
Changing conditions
The answer to the puzzle is, it is suggested, the changing conditions of US
economic life. According to statistics compiled by the Washington-based
Economic Policy Institute, the incomes of families in the top 1 per cent of
the US income distribution grew 63 per cent during the 1980s, while the
bottom 60 per cent of families experienced an income decline. What income
growth there was over the period was, for most families, the result of more
work at lower wages. Part-time and temporary employment has become
increasingly important, while the availability of secure, good-paying jobs
has shrunk.
These characteristics of the 1980s have continued into the 1990s. The
white-collar unemployment rate rose by an above average amount during the
recession and the absolute rise in white-collar unemployment was greater
than for blue-collar workers. The recovery has not reversed these adverse
trends.
It is hardly surprising then that the majority of Americans feel
disgruntled. What is surprising, however, is that the party of
redistribution and government intervention has - apart from in Bill
Clinton's less than sweeping electoral victory - made no political mileage
out of the woe.
Insecurity and inequality may explain the lack of a 'feel good' factor. Yet
they have not encouraged American voters to turn to those who believe
government is the solution, but to those who say it is the problem. Who
better encapsulates this mood of conservative populism than Congressman Newt
Gingrich, virtually certain to be the next speaker of the House of
Representatives?
Election lesson
The lesson of these elections is neither that the American people are fed up
with Mr Clinton nor that they are fed up with incumbents. It is that they
are fed up with the Democrats. The Democrats have lost 11 governorships,
which can hardly be explained by the unpopularity of either the president or
of Washington. As for the alleged hatred of incumbents, no Republican
incumbent has so far lost a governorship, a senate race, or a house seat.
The turnout of less than 40 per cent may be a partial explanation for this
conservatism, with the economically marginal marginalising themselves
politically as well. But low turnouts are normal in US mid-term elections.
In any case, the proportion of the American people that has failed to
prosper is too large for this to be the main explanation.
If the lesson is indeed the appeal of conservative populism, it has echoes
elsewhere. Silvio Berlusconi is prime minister of Italy because of it.
Similarly Helmut Kohl, who managed once again to run against Bonn and win,
despite poor German economic performance during his last term of office.
Jacques Chirac, too, is mounting his bid for power as a conservative
populist. Margaret Thatcher was one, as was her friend Ronald Reagan. John
Major is not and poor defeated George Bush failed to be one either.
Where does this election leave the view that incumbents win when economies
are doing well and lose when they are in recession? In tatters. And where
does it leave the other conventional view, that parties of the left should
capitalise on economic insecurity and growing inequality? Also in tatters.
In the UK, Mr Kenneth Clarke and the Tories have been forcibly reminded that
recovery does not guarantee victory. But Mr Blair must realise that Tory
failures and widespread economic insecurity are no guarantee of his party's
electoral success, either.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Cost-cutting at a premium: Competitive pressures in the
insurance market look set to claim victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chaos. Over-capacity. High costs. Entrenched attitudes.' Such bullet points
could have been chosen to describe the outlook for UK manufacturing industry
at the start of the 1980s: thousands of jobs were subsequently lost, many
large companies disappeared, survivors had to find different markets and
new, more efficient ways of working.
In fact, the list comes from a presentation given four years ago by
Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer, on future prospects
for the life insurance sector.
This week such warnings of upheaval in the industry - not just among life
companies but also general insurers - appear prescient. Norwich Union, one
of the UK's largest insurers, announced on Tuesday that up to 2,000 jobs
(about a fifth of its workforce) would be lost from its life and general
insurance operations in the next three to five years. Two days later Royal
Insurance, the composite insurance group, forecast that its UK workforce
would drop by 10 per cent over the next three years.
At first sight, there appears to be little cause for gloom. Royal's
prognosis came as the group announced a tripling of the group's pre-tax
profits in the first nine months of this year. Commercial Union, one of the
UK's largest composite insurers, this week announced a doubling of pre-tax
profits over the same period to Pounds 305m. Similarly buoyant figures are
expected next week from General Accident.
Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, says the UK insurance industry is
enjoying a 'golden scenario': rises in premium rates over the past few years
have boosted income, while favourable weather conditions and improving crime
figures have led to fewer claims on policies.
But the latest set of results may come to be seen as the top of the wave in
a notoriously cyclical industry. A combination of factors is leading many in
the industry to expect tougher years ahead: computer and communications
technology has opened the way for a rapid expansion in telephone selling;
the life industry faces a tighter regulatory environment; and signs are
growing that segments of the insurance industry are becoming saturated.
Norwich Union does not expect to be the last company to announce job losses.
However, Mr Philip Scott, the company's general manager for life and
pensions, says: 'It is difficult to predict whether they will be companies
like ourselves, acting in anticipation to make some quite significant
changes, or companies slower to react which then find that change hits them
round the ear.'
So far the number of people employed in the insurance industry has been
remarkably steady at about 250,000 or above in recent years - while some
companies have shed labour, others have expanded their workforces to grab
market share. That may be about to change.
'General insurance businesses are using fewer people, while life insurance
and pensions businesses are having to reduce their costs,' says Mr Tony
Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers. 'I
believe we will see employment falling fairly significantly.'
The number of sales agents employed by life insurers, for instance, has
already dropped sharply. The total either employed directly by a life
company or acting as representatives had fallen by more than a third from a
peak in 1991 to less than 120,000 by the end of last year. Job losses in the
pipeline at some large insurers - most notably Legal &amp; General - mean that
total will drop again this year.
The motivation behind this job shedding, shared by companies across the
general and life sectors, is desire to cut costs. In practice there is
little alternative in the UK: subdued consumer spending is limiting the
market's growth rate. Improvements in product specification can quickly be
copied by competitors and bring only shortlived gains.
The task of cutting costs is not made any easier in the life and pensions
sector as official regulators become more demanding and set tougher
standards to ensure that sales agents are competent and properly trained. Mr
Stephen Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance
group, believes such compliance costs are now seven or eight times higher
than at the beginning of the decade.
At the same time, regulation is increasing the need to cut expenses. From
the beginning of next year, new rules will oblige sales agents to tell
customers the costs of selling the policy, including any commission they are
paid for making the sale. That will focus increased attention on charges
imposed by the insurance companies.
'Commission disclosure and charges disclosure are going to have a
significant commercial impact,' says Mr David Prosser, chief executive of
Legal &amp; General.
Low inflation and interest rates are adding to the pressure to cut costs in
the life industry.
'We estimate that you will be doing well to average a 10 per cent investment
return a year in the 1990s,' says Mr Scott of the Norwich Union. 'If your
expenses are still 4 per cent, that leaves just 6 per cent for the investor
and you have a big problem.'
Yet the special problems of the life industry have not stopped new entrants.
Halifax and Nationwide, the UK's two largest building societies, are poised
to start selling their own life policies from next year, ending the current
relationships by which they sell only the products of Standard Life and
Guardian Royal Exchange respectively. Marks and Spencer, the high street
retailer, is due to start selling its own life insurance and pensions
policies from April.
That tide of new competitors extends deep into the traditional businesses of
the general insurance companies. The most serious challenge to the big UK
composites is the trend towards direct selling of insurance to private
individuals via the telephone. Leading the pack has been Direct Line, set up
by Mr Peter Wood in 1985 with backing from the Royal Bank of Scotland and
now the largest UK private motor insurer. Direct Line will announce soon
that it has 2m motorists on its books.
The new arrivals are snatching market share in the private motor insurance
sector with a dramatic impact on the existing insurers. Commercial Union is
now insuring 18 per cent fewer private motorists than a year ago.
The lower overheads of the direct sellers - they are often sited in cheap
locations and do not use brokers - mean they can push prices lower. After
rising rapidly in the early 1990s, motor insurance rates are tumbling.
Industry estimates suggest a 5 per cent fall over the past year, a figure
that observers regard as conservative. Mr Steven Bird at securities house
Smith New Court, says: 'Anyone who has renewed their cover in October or
November knows that they can get more than a 5 per cent reduction, unless
they have had an accident.' SG Warburg, the investment bank, reckons that by
the end of this year rates may have fallen by 10 per cent.
Established insurance companies have followed Direct Line's example in
adopting telephone selling. Royal Insurance set up its own direct selling
company, The Insurance Service, soon after Direct Line's arrival and it now
serves about 400,000 motorists. But total private motor business
underwritten by the Royal group has actually fallen recently.
Even where direct sales companies are not active, insurance companies are
unlikely to enjoy the increases in premium rates of recent years. The pace
of increase in premiums for commercial insurance policies, for example, is
slowing.
The worry for the big insurance companies is of a a spiral downwards in
premium rates, with lower-cost operators forcing them ever downwards and
making others cut their own throats to retain market share. With many direct
sellers expanding into home insurance, premium rates on such policies have
already fallen substantially over the past year. This could also affect the
life business, with Direct Line already selling mortgages and due to launch
a range of term assurance products next January.
But there are signs that the main insurance companies have decided not to
try to beat the direct writers at their own game. 'There is a general
recognition that the pursuit of market share is a mug's game,' says an
insurance executive.
Instead, the established insurance companies may decide to be more selective
 -for instance, abandoning the private motor sector if the price war becomes
too bloody. They also question whether consumers will want to buy an
ever-expanding range of products over the telephone. If they can
successfully persuade consumers that products such as life insurance or home
cover are too complex to be purchased over the telephone, they have a chance
of retaining market share.
The bigger companies can also look to overseas growth. Commercial Union
argues that its acquisition last month of French insurer Groupe Victoire
will increase the diversity of the group's life and general businesses.
Other companies are using their UK experience to expand telephone-selling
operations elsewhere in continental Europe; or trying to take advantage of
European Union attempts at deregulating the insurance industry to enter new
markets. In most of Europe, however, opportunities for expansion are
limited.
So UK insurance companies have little option but to review their sales
methods, distribution costs, and claims handling to find the best means of
retaining profitability.
Few doubt that the competitive pressures in both general and life insurance
will claim victims. Earlier this year, a study by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow
suggested that 40 per cent of UK life companies had expense ratios that
would make them vulnerable in a price war. Direct motor writers admit
privately the motor market has become overcrowded and casualties are likely
over the next few years. Premium income for the large composites may fall.
For those that can become leaner, however, there is the prospect of thriving
in the longer term. Unlike manufacturing, there is no suggestion that the UK
financial services sector is in terminal decline. Many life companies, for
instance, believe pensions and healthcare policies will become increasingly
popular as the state becomes less willing to provide for the old and ill.
If the large companies are able to stand back from a price war, short-term
losses in profits may be rewarded by a longer-term smoothing of the premium
rate cycle. For those which are prepared to take the pain of job losses, the
longer term gains will be worth achieving.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Men in the News: The awkward triangle - Dole, Gingrich and
Gramm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dickens would have had fun with the names Dole, Gingrich and Gramm, perhaps
making them a modest firm of Victorian solicitors supposedly protecting
widow's mites but actually taking a little off the top. The modern DG&amp;G,
however, is entirely different - outspoken, moneyed and so powerful that
this week it left the president of the United States politically much poorer
and half-pleading for mercy.
On the surface, little appears to separate the current senior partners,
Senator Robert Dole, 70, of Kansas, Congressman Newt Gingrich, 51, from
Georgia and Senator Phil Gramm, 52, of Texas. They are all white male
Protestant Republicans, shown in the mid-term elections to be the dominant
political class, and they represent parts of the country which have either
always been conservative or which have moved increasingly to the right in
recent years.
All worked tirelessly for Tuesday's landslide. Mr Dole, as senior Republican
in the Senate, has been the party's titular head since President George
Bush's defeat in 1992, Mr Gingrich was its principal strategist and also
cheerleader in races for the House, while Mr Gramm performed the same
electoral function in the Senate.
Subcutaneously, however, there are divisions that may make this week's
harmony illusory, and they seem to split the three into couples. Two (Dole
and Gingrich) will from January run the two chambers of Congress, as Senate
majority leader and as Speaker of the House respectively. Two (Dole and
Gramm) would like to be elected president in 1996. The two PhDs (Gingrich
and Gramm) are ideologues, true believers in the conservative faith in less
government and lower taxes.
Two (Dole and Gramm) have wives with successful independent careers not
unlike Hillary Clinton, who is forever feeling the lash of the Gramm and
Gingrich tongues. Elizabeth Dole was transportation secretary under
President Ronald Reagan and now runs the American Red Cross, while Wendy
Gramm was formerly head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Two
(Gingrich and Gramm) are a generation younger than the third.
The larger apparent differences, partly a product of age, are between Dole
and Gingrich. Though unabashedly partisan and sometimes as mean as a
junkyard dog, the senator's real milieu is Washington. He likes its high
stakes wheeling and dealing and, fancying itself as a tough town, it likes
his cutting sense of humour.
But Gingrich loathes the political status quo, perhaps because he started in
politics working for quintessential Republican moderate Nelson Rockefeller.
As long ago as 1982, he was so furious at the outcome of a finance bill
negotiated by Dole that he dismissed him as 'the tax collector for the
welfare state'.
Parts of this year's Republican manifesto - the 'contract with America'
designed by Gingrich - leave Dole patently uncomfortable. Proud of being a
professional politician, he dislikes the idea of imposing limits on the
number of terms that may be served in Congress.
Dole is also less fond of simplistic solutions than Gingrich and Gramm -
like constitutional amendments to balance the budget or the 1980s
budget-cutting process known as Gramm-Rudman - that promise gain without
specifying the pain. He is less inclined than his two partners to eviscerate
social programmes, partly because of his own history as an impoverished,
wounded ex-soldier who was much helped early on by the welfare state.
'Government does a lot of good things,' he said this week.
Gramm, though a flagwaver for the contract and second to none in his
determination to cut government down to size, can also be disarmingly frank.
He said this week he really did not know if the balanced budget amendment or
term limits would serve any useful purpose, but since they were clearly the
will of the people there was no point in resisting them.
If there are signs of war between Dole and Gramm - and also with a powerful
group of senior Republican moderates - for control of the Senate's
legislative agenda, Gingrich faces no such constraints in the House. He had
already mastered the existing membership by disposing of challenges nearly a
year ago to his succeeding Bob Michel as leader and the new intake is
largely shaped in his image. Unlike Dole and Gramm, he will not be
distracted by presidential ambitions.
The question is whether, after 14 years fighting a Democratic majority, he
can temper his slash-and-burn ideologies to the realities of power. This
week's evidence was mixed: he promised co-operation with the White House,
but could not resist vilifying its present inhabitants as 'counter-culture
McGovernicks' and 'left-wing elitists'.
Though presumably not a candidate in 1996, Gingrich will be influential in
the Republican selection. Of the firm's partners, he should logically prefer
Gramm over Dole, but the field could be very large. Gramm, who has one of
the Senate's better minds but one of its least attractive public personae,
is definitely in the race and has Dollars 15m already in his campaign bank.
It is tough to tell about Dole, but age and the sour memory of previous
campaigns will count against him and he would not be the first to find
managing the Senate incompatible with running for national office. He might,
anyway, enjoy himself too much, which is precisely what DG&amp;G, in their
present and understandable pomp, have been doing all week.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Marketmakers face penalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange has decided to penalise marketmakers that fail to
fix opening prices on time for shares trading on its SEAQ system. The system
acts as an electronic bulletin board for share prices.
The fines, which will operate in a manner similar to those in effect for the
trading of international securities, could end in a fine of up to Pounds
25,000 and/or deregistration as a marketmaker in the relevant security.
Marketmakers are securities firms which agree to make firm offers to buy or
sell large lots of securities. Because they commit their own capital to
promote share liquidity, they have certain privileges, including the right
to borrow stock and to sell stock short.
These privileges are considered essential for securities firms wishing to
trade on their own account and for those wishing to create derivative
instruments for clients.
The stock exchange said that marketmakers issue firm quotes to customers on
time '99 per cent of the time'.
From December 1 quotes not posted within five minutes of the mandatory quote
period will bring a Pounds 10 fine per security per day. If the same firm is
fined twice in any three-month period, the second offence will carry a
Pounds 25 fine. If in any six-month period the same marketmaker offends for
a third time, summary disciplinary procedures will be invoked.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Ministers feel long arm of the law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has had a difficult week in the courts. On Wednesday, the
Appeal Court ruled that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had acted
unlawfully by introducing a new compensation scheme for victims of violent
crime without referring it to parliament.
On Thursday the High Court ruled that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, had acted unlawfully in authorising Pounds 234m from the overseas
aid budget for the Pergau Dam in Malaysia.
The two embarrassing defeats underlined the growing willingness of the
judiciary to curb abuses of executive power. Increasingly, it seems, where
parliament has shown itself incapable or inept at placing adequate controls
on the executive, judges are filling the void.
Lawyers say there is nothing radically new in this. What this week's
judgments show is the dramatic extent to which the ambit of judicial review
has increased. Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to
1,500 in 1987 and almost 2,900 last year. There were 1,851 applications in
the first seven months of this year, against 1,728 in the same period last
year.
'It's a continuation of a long-established trend,' said one leading public
law QC. 'The courts more and more will look into areas which 20 years ago
were regarded as the prerogative of the executive.'
Twenty years ago, for example, the courts would not have intervened in the
exercise of a minister's prerogative - non-statutory - powers as they did
when overturning Mr Howard's criminal injuries compensation scheme.
That bar to judicial intervention was removed by the House of Lords in 1985
in a case brought by the civil service unions against the government's
attempts to ban unions at GCHQ, the government's listening post, at
Cheltenham.
As recently as 1984, when the government was attempting to prevent Sir
Freddie Laker litigating against British Airways in the US, the courts took
the view that they should support the government's stance on foreign
affairs. No such sensibilities prevail now, as Mr Hurd discovered to his
cost.
The fact that the court was prepared to entertain a challenge from a
pressure group, the World Development Movement, in the Pergau case also
underlines the increasing breadth of judicial review.
Until recently it proved difficult for groups to establish they had the
necessary interest in a government decision to mount a court challenge. The
courts took the view that an agglomeration of individuals each of whom had
no interest in a decision could not, as a group, have an interest. That
position has been discarded.
The Law Commission, the government's law reform body, recently called for
reform of the judicial review procedure to cut delays in handling
challenges. The commission also endorsed the view that public-interest
groups, as well as individuals, adversely affected by administrative
decisions should in future have the right to apply for judicial review.
The executive is more exposed to legal challenges than ever before - but for
each government defeat in the courts, there are as many, if not more,
victories. The lesson for ministers from this week's events must be to live
within the law or risk a bloody nose in the courts.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Reynolds skulks in the wings: The Newry murder has made the
Irish premier reticent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The usually firm hand of Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister of the Irish
republic, was notably absent yesterday as his government awaited assurances
from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, after Thursday's murder of a post
office worker across the border in Newry.
Few commentators in Dublin can remember a time in the 10 weeks since the IRA
ceasefire in which the Irish premier has been quite so reticent about taking
centre stage on a policy which he has orchestrated almost single-handedly
from the Irish side.
After his government's decision to rescind its programme of IRA prisoner
releases, it was left to the hapless justice minister, Mrs Maire
Geoghegan-Quinn, normally a sure-footed performer, to explain the
about-turn.
The Dublin government has often warned of the dangers of leaving large
numbers of republicans behind bars once a ceasefire was in place. It argued
a goodwill gesture was needed to bolster the moderate voice in the IRA.
Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn was adamant that at no time did the government plan the
release of more than nine prisoners, in spite of newspaper reports in the
republic that as many as 30 convicted terrorists were being considered.
Her government colleagues were yesterday quick to applaud her robust defence
of the policy reversal. Only Sinn Fein expressed outright disappointment.
Another surprise was the absence of any murmur of discontent from civil
liberties groups. Some politicians, however, privately wondered about the
consistency - having offered to release the prisoners - of withdrawing the
concession because of an event 60 miles away in another state.
Not only the release programme has been put on hold. Dublin is reviewing its
whole approach to the peace process. Where days ago a cross-party consensus
had prevailed in the republic in support of Mr Reynolds' efforts, the
opposition yesterday seemed to have a renewed bounce in its step.
Both governments insist the peace process is on track. Mr Dick Spring, the
republic's foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, are due to meet in Dublin on Monday about progress on the
framework document.
The Northern Ireland Office said yesterday that nothing had changed its
'working assumption' that the IRA had ceased its military operations.
Exploratory talks with Sinn Fein about the 'practical consequences' of the
ceasefire may start this year. They would cover the decommissioning of arms
and explosives, and the steps required to return Sinn Fein to democratic
politics and the bilateral talks.
But the Newry murder and Sinn Fein's less than frank explanation underline
the danger of taking its assurances on the permanence of the ceasefire at
face value without first verifying the disposal of arms and explosives. 'It
will certainly make us more cautious,' said a UK government official.
The Newry tragedy has underscored British concerns that the issue of arms
and explosives must be addressed before full political negotiations can
begin, in spite of the insistence of Mr Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein
vice-president, that the issue is 'down the road'.
The main outstanding question is whether the Newry attack was carried out by
a renegade republican unit or whether it was in some way at the behest of
the IRA's central command. If the former, then there seems no reason why
London should not begin discussing the handing in of arms with republican
leaders before the end of the year, as previously envisaged. Indeed, the
incident might even play a part in helping to convince the leadership of
Sinn Fein that it has something to gain from the surrender of at least some
IRA weaponry at a relatively early stage in the peace process.
But if the raid was sanctioned by IRA leaders, then the UK government's
so-called working assumption that the IRA ceasefire was permanent would be
under severe pressure. It is hard to see under those circumstances how a
severe delay in preliminary dialogue between London and republican leaders
could be avoided.
Thursday's attack also underlines the importance of efforts being made by
senior British and Irish officials to develop a co-ordinated approach to
dismantling paramilitary arsenals, as agreed at Chequers last month. Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, said the discussions would concentrate on the
'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons held by paramilitaries to
be handed over.
It is almost certain that these discussions will have continued at
yesterday's meeting of the liaison committee of British and Irish officials
in Dublin. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring will be under pressure to say more on
Monday about the substance of the committee's deliberations.

FT  12 NOV 94 / National Theatre says it faces loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Theatre said yesterday it might make a loss this year after a
surplus of Pounds 539,000 on a turnover of Pounds 28.3m in 1993-94, Antony
Thorncroft writes.
The Royal Shakespeare Company, the UK's other leading publicly funded
theatre company, reported a surplus of almost Pounds 1.4m last year on a
Pounds 27.4m turnover.
The hot summer and the failure of some new productions hit box office income
at the National Theatre. But it hopes to keep any deficit below Pounds
500,000.
The National Theatre has been successful in controlling costs in recent
years, and has accumulated a reserve of Pounds 927,000. The RSC still has a
deficit of more than Pounds 1m but for the third successive year has managed
to cut it.
Both companies are suffering from the freeze in government subsidy, which is
more than 40 per cent of their incomes.
Baroness Detta O'Cathain, managing director of the Barbican Centre, is
taking paid leave of absence, the Corporation of London said yesterday.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Gilts market operators welcome launch of Treasury review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors and marketmakers are hoping for substantial changes in the way the
gilts market operates, in the wake of a review announced by the Treasury.
Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, said his officials would 'examine the
present arrangements within government for the issuance of government debt
to ensure that we keep up with best practice in Europe and elsewhere'.
The review, led by Treasury economist Mr Jonathan Portes, will look at
existing debt management arrangements, the selling of government debt and
the management of outstanding debt. A report is expected by next summer.
The Treasury announced in March that it was giving the Bank greater freedom
to operate in the gilts market, allowing it to choose the timing and nature
of issues within the terms of the annual remit established by the Treasury.
One option to be considered by the review is a more structured system of
auctions, along US lines. Mr Andrew Burtenshaw, investment manager at
Norwich Union, said he would like a better auction timetable. 'The one we
have at the moment is a bit hit and miss.'
Mr Burtenshaw also thought it would improve the efficiency of the market if
the maturity of the stock was known further in advance. 'Half the auctions
tend to be of the five, 10 or 15-year benchmark stocks so they might as well
go the whole hog.'
Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe), said a
change in the handling of gilt auctions was especially desirable for foreign
investors who 'find the uncertainty to be a real deterrent'.
Mr Shepperd also recommended making all gilts free of tax for residents
abroad. At the moment some gilt issues are tax-free for non-UK investors and
others are not.
One issue the Treasury review will not cover is extension of the repurchase,
or repo, system in the gilts market. The Bank of England instituted a
short-term gilt repo facility following sterling's departure from the
exchange rate mechanism, as a means of easing very large shortages in the
money market.
Under the repo system, the Bank is a party to all agreements. It has been
consulting for some months over the creation of an 'open repo market' to
allow gilts investors to have repurchase agreements with each other with the
aim of adding liquidity to the market.
The Bank will shortly issue a consultation paper on the subject, and there
has been much speculation that an open repo market will be announced in the
Budget.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Hurd rules out talk of resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd yesterday said he had considered resigning in the light of
Thursday's High Court ruling that he acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds
234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia.
But the foreign secretary made it clear that he would not quit. 'I have
never knowingly broken the law, and would not dream of doing so,' he said.
His remarks came less than 24 hours after the court ruled that the grant of
aid was 'fatally flawed' because the project was 'economically unsound' and
did not promote the development of a country's economy as required by aid
laws.
The ruling was the second defeat for ministers in the courts in two days.
Mr Hurd said that in 1991, when he was considering the matter, 'no one
suggested at any time that the choice was about the law'.
'A promise had been given that the project would be carried through,' he
said.
'The project was then criticised - powerfully criticised but not at all on
legal grounds - and I had to decide whether it was right . . . on grounds of
economy and efficiency to go ahead and fulfil the undertakings Mrs Thatcher
had given.
'It wasn't a very easy decision, but I decided it was better to honour the
word this country had given.'
Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Hurd said the court had not ruled that the
project should not go ahead, but that it could not be financed out of the
aid budget. 'I now have to consider how the aid budget can be conducted on
this basis, whether we need to appeal or not,' he said.
His remarks came after Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, called for
somebody to be 'held to account'.
Mr Peter Shore, the Labour MP who chaired the inquiry held by the Commons
foreign affairs committee, said the Pounds 234m 'wrongly taken' from the aid
programme should be given to those who would truly benefit.
Mr Cook wrote to Mr Hurd seeking assurances that the funds would be repaid
to the aid budget.
Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide finance for the
dam in 1989 while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with Malaysia.
Mr Hurd authorised the first instalment in 1991 in spite of advice from Sir
Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration, that the funding was 'an abuse of the aid programme'.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Press watchdog chief confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Wakeham, the former Conservative cabinet minister, has agreed to become
the second chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the industry body
that regulates standards in newspapers and magazines.
The appointment of the former leader of the House of Lords, who was Baroness
Thatcher's chief whip for five years, will be announced formally next week
after talks with Lord McGregor, the present chairman, on the timing of his
retirement.
Lord McGregor, aged 73, is expected to go at the end of this year, although
his contract does not run out until the end of 1995. He has had considerable
success in protecting the concept of self-regulation in the face of demands
for statutory intervention.
The appointment of a former senior Conservative politician may appear
surprising, in the light of the tension between press and government over
recent sleaze allegations, but Lord Wakeham has been seen as a potentially
moderating influence on those who favour statutory regulation.
A promised bill on the press and privacy is now more than a year overdue
amid considerable disagreements on what it should contain.
There is a strong feeling in the newspaper industry that the committee has
never been given full credit for what it has achieved.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Lukewarm reply to pension plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small to medium-sized companies are lukewarm about the government's plans
for occupational pension reform, expected to be announced in the Queen's
Speech on Wednesday, a survey has found.
The survey, by Bain Hogg Financial Services, found that less than half of
all employers welcomed the introduction of compulsory member trustees.
Roughly 60 per cent of all members of the National Association of Pension
Funds members already have member trustees and say they are happy with them.
About a third of respondents thought the minimum solvency proposals would
increase the short-term cost of running a scheme, while 40 per cent said it
would cause them to review their investment strategy. Only 11 per cent said
the solvency requirements would undermine their commitment to running a
scheme.
Meanwhile, small to medium-sized employers overwhelmingly felt that they
should not have to contribute towards an industry-wide compensation scheme
to cover fraud losses.
Nearly half felt compensation should be met from taxes. The survey did not
ask whether respondents were prepared to see tax increases to cover the
costs. It says: 'The inevitable conclusion is that many firms would prefer
no compensation scheme at all.'
The survey obtained responses from more than 500 companies with pension
schemes that had an average membership of just below 400.

Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, yesterday sought to dispel
suggestions that its finances would be stretched by a Court of Appeal ruling
this week which threatens to disrupt its attempts at reclaiming debt from
lossmaking members, Ralph Atkins writes.
It said that information supplied to the Department of Trade and Industry
this summer had shown its total assets were three times the required minimum
for general business.
The appeal court ruled this week that Lloyd's might have breached EU law by
setting up a 'central fund' to settle claims on policies underwritten when
Names - individuals whose assets back the market - refuse, or are unable, to
provide the funds. Lloyd's is appealing against the decision.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Lib Dems court case on Literal Democrat fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Liberal Democrats failed yesterday to have the result of a European
parliamentary election in June declared void and a new ballot ordered.
The party believes it was deprived of victory in the Devon and Plymouth East
constituency because Mr Richard Huggett, a rival candidate, described
himself as a Literal Democrat on the ballot paper.
Yesterday, the Election Court ruled that, under rules set by parliament, any
description was optional. The judges suggested parliament might wish to
reconsider the rules to prevent abuse.
It is believed to be the first time in a British parliamentary election that
there has been a legal challenge to a candidate's description. The Liberal
Democrats, who were ordered to pay costs, have yet to decide whether to
appeal.
Mr Huggett, a retired headmaster who did not campaign, polled 10,203 votes.
His name appeared higher on the ballot paper than Mr Adrian Sanders, the
Liberal Democrat candidate, who lost by 700 votes to Mr Giles Chichester,
the Conservative candidate, who polled 74,953 votes.
Mr Piers Coleman, of Nicholson, Graham &amp; Jones, the Liberal Democrats'
lawyers, said yesterday there had been 505 statements by voters saying they
had mistakenly voted for Mr Huggett.
The election petition was brought by Mr Sanders and a representative elector
against the acting returning officer and Mr Chichester.
Rejecting the petition, Mr Justice Dyson and Mr Justice Forbes ruled that,
under the Representation of the People Act 1969, the minimum requirements
for identifying a candidate were the full name and home address. Any
description was optional.
'Contrary to what might be thought to be the popular view, parliament has
focused on certain minimum criteria for identifying candidates which do not
include references to political parties, it being assumed that voters will
learn all they need to know about the candidates during the election
campaigns,' they said.
It was also clear that 'the rules do not prohibit candidates - whether out
of spite or a wicked sense of fun - describing themselves in a confusing way
or indulging in spoiling tactics'. Parliament, in debating the rules, had
understood the possibility of abuse and accepted it with apparent
equanimity.
Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat president, said: 'A signal has been
sent to anyone who wants to disrupt this country's democratic processes that
they are perfectly at liberty to do so.'
Mr Chichester described the Liberal Democrats' argument as arrogant. 'I
believe that most of the people who voted Literal Democrat did so
deliberately.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / 'Penniless' Walker aide fined Pounds 25,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Wilfred Aquilina, former finance director of Brent Walker, the property
and leisure group, was led in distress from court yesterday after receiving
a Pounds 25,000 fine and a suspended jail sentence on a charge of false
accounting.
Mr Aquilina, now a restaurateur who lives in south-west London, was
convicted last month on a 10-1 majority verdict of one charge of false
accounting after Mr George Walker, his former boss, was cleared of
orchestrating a Pounds 19m fraud at Brent Walker.
Mr Roy Amlot, his counsel, said Mr Aquilina was virtually penniless and
asked Judge Geoffrey Rivlin to reconsider the fine and nine months'
imprisonment imposed in default if the amount was not paid within six
months.
Mr Aquilina's wife, Janet, was called to the witness box and told the judge
that if he insisted on imposing such a fine, their Pounds 280,000 family
home - which she owns and which still has a large outstanding mortgage -
would have to be sold.
After further discussion, the judge agreed to stay the fine for 21 days. But
he ordered a 'careful investigation' into Mr Aquilina's finances.
He said the Crown accepted that Mr Aquilina's debts exceeded his assets by
Pounds 100,000, but there was no doubt that in recent years he had made very
substantial gifts to his wife in the form of the family home and cash.
He added: 'I believe a fine of Pounds 25,000 is proper . . . and but for the
things said to me today, the fine would have been a more substantial one and
there would have been a costs order.'
Judge Rivlin said yesterday that the prosecution had proved only a fraction
of its original allegations against Mr Aquilina, but the offence of which he
was convicted was a serious one.
It was committed nearly four years ago when City accountants started
investigating the removal of Pounds 4.5m from Brent Walker's coffers. Mr
Aquilina, acting as a consultant to the group, having been ousted the
previous year as finance director with a Pounds 500,000 golden handshake,
was asked to help.
The judge said he knowingly provided accountants with false information
about the company's financial position.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Conversative party will seek poetic justice at ballot box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A new political organisation, the Conversative party, announced yesterday
that it was targeting up to 4,000 Tory marginal council seats next year in a
bid to disrupt the local elections.
The self-styled leader of the Conversatives is Mr Alan Cornish, a Liberal
Democrat supporter who unsuccessfully contested a parliamentary seat in
1979.
Mr Cornish described yesterday's court ruling on the Literal Democrat case
as 'bloody silly' adding: 'While these are the rules, we will play by them.'
Mr Cornish, a 54-year-old company director, claimed his bid to field
candidates in May would force the government to address the problem of
ballot paper confusion.
'The situation as it stands . . . is morally wrong and totally corrupt. But
that is what this government is about and it would be a poetic way to see
them lose office.'
The Liberal Democrat party distanced itself from his action.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Reprieve for herbal remedies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Selling herbal remedies will continue to be legal, the government announced
yesterday, quelling fears that selling ancient herbal treatments would be
outlawed under a European Union directive.
Under the 1968 Medicines Act, herbal cures are exempt from licensing
requirements. But the Medicines Control Agency - the executive agency of the
Department of Health which licenses drugs and medicines for sale in the UK -
found no exemption for herbal medicines in a series of EU directives.
Last month it announced that it would enforce the new regulations from
January 1, requiring the licensing of thousands of products - thought to be
used by about 5m people a year. It was feared that the expense of compliance
would have done serious damage to an industry which employs about 3,000
people with a turnover of about Pounds 300m a year. Medical herbalists had
also warned that this could create a dangerous underground trade.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said yesterday that the relevant
EU directive required herbal medicines to be licensed if 'industrially
produced' - a term not defined in UK or European law.
'The government believes that those herbal medicines currently exempt under
UK law are made according to a number of traditional processes that fall
outside the interpretation of an industrial process,' he said. 'As a result
they can be exempted from the new legislation.'
Homeopathic medicines are licensed under separate EU directives and their
position is not affected.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Clarke writes to all MPs over EU payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday wrote to all MPs to win their support for a bill
increasing Britain's contributions to the European Union.
The chancellor's unusual move followed threats by some Tory Eurosceptics to
block the bill in retaliation for the cabinet's climbdown over Post Office
privatisation.
The overall battle plan for EU legislation received cabinet backing on
Thursday after an hour-long meeting. Mr John Major, the prime minister,
urged cabinet colleagues to make clear that the measure - the European
Community finance bill - would lock in arrangements for British rebates from
the EU until the end of the century.
Mr Clarke admitted in his letter that the bill, to be introduced in the next
session of parliament starting next week, will result in net costs for the
UK.
But he insisted that these would be small - at Pounds 75m in the 1995-96
financial year, rising to Pounds 250m in 1999 - and much less than those
faced by other EU states.
He stressed that the UK rebate, or abatement, which was negotiated by
Baroness Thatcher when she was prime minister in the 1980s, will continue.
The abatement, which Mr Clarke said had saved Pounds 16bn since 1984, will
continue to limit British payments to the EU budget.
Tory Maastricht rebels are split over the bill, which must be passed to fix
EU budgets to the end of the century. Some are determined to oppose it - but
others will support the government in the interests of party unity.
One Eurosceptic predicted yesterday that 'less than half a dozen'
Conservative MPs would oppose the measure - insufficient to overturn the
government's 14-strong Commons majority, even if all opposition MPs also
vote against the government.
Mr Clarke admitted that many MPs would wonder why the government had agreed
a settlement that increased the revenue that the European Union can raise
from its member states, especially when national budgets were under
pressure. But he said the deal, agreed in 1992, was 'very tough'.
The 1992 settlement, he said, provided for an average increase in EU
expenditure commitments of 3.3 per cent a year in real terms from 1992 to
1999. This was a much lower increase than the 5.3 per cent annual real
increase agreed for 1987 to 1992.
However, the rate of growth of real EU spending is likely to be much higher
than that for British government spending which will be detailed in the UK
Budget later this month.
The UK has usually been the second largest net contributor to the EU budget
after Germany. But the chancellor said he expected France and the
Netherlands would be making bigger net contributions per head than Britain
by the end of the century.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Landlords serve notice on chancellor: Robyn Chalmers looks
at what the private-rented sector wants Clarke to deliver in the Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure is mounting for the government to introduce financial incentives to
private landlords who fear that cuts in housing benefit expected in this
month's Budget will undermine the private housing market.
Banks and building societies which provide loans to housing associations are
also concerned that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, under pressure from
rightwing Tories, may have opted to curtail the Pounds 8bn spending on
housing benefit.
More than two-fifths of private tenants are estimated to receive the benefit
and any cut could damage the fragile recovery of the private-rented sector,
which has grown from about 1.8m units in 1988 to about 2m last year.
Lobbying groups argue that the market is also threatened by the ending of
the business expansion scheme (BES) and the tentative upturn of the
residential property market.
The private-rented sector was ignored in last year's Budget, in spite of the
government's wish to expand the market. Interest groups, including the
Association of Residential Letting Agents, the independent Housing
Investment Group and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, are looking for
positive steps this month.
The main proposal backed by these groups is for the establishment of
authorised housing investment trusts to promote institutional investment.
These would be backed by government grants of up to 25 per cent of the cost
of properties.
A recent report by the Housing Investment Group and the letting agents
association estimates that grants of up to Pounds 250m a year supporting a
total investment of Pounds 1bn would provide 16,600 new or reconditioned
properties at an average cost to the exchequer of Pounds 15,000 a home.
Other proposals which have been floated include grants for capital costs,
depreciation allowances and tax concessions.
The recent growth of the private-rented market has come largely on the back
of the BES scheme and the poor state of the housing market. The BES was
expensive and short-lived, bringing 76,000 units to the market over five
years at a cost to the public purse of Pounds 24,000 each. Many are expected
to be sold for home ownership when tax concessions end after four years.
Professor Peter Kemp, director of York University's Centre for Housing
Policy, maintains that the size of the private-rented sector is likely to be
affected at the margin by what happens to house prices. He said: 'If house
prices increase substantially, and especially if there is another boom, the
size of the sector is likely to fall to some extent.'
He added that returns for many landlords were low compared with alternative
investments. 'There seems little prospect of the major financial
institutions being attracted into the sector unless subsidy is provided to
close the yield gap,' he said.
But Mr John Roberts, of the Department of the Environment, argued recently
that the point of a private rental market was that it should not depend on
large government subsidies or unduly favourable tax treatment. 'The public
sector cannot and need not meet all housing needs,' he said.
The cost of both housing benefit and of income support for mortgage interest
payments have spiralled in recent years. It is therefore in the government's
interest to promote reasonably priced rental housing for poorer tenants who
will be hardest hit by any housing benefit cut.
By the same token, it is seeking to reduce the role played by local
authorities in the sector by promoting a more market-orientated provision.
Prof Kemp, in recently published research, said the government could
consider reducing the maximum housing benefit from the current 100 per cent
and implementing rent ceilings - two proposals aimed specifically at
combating high rents in the sector. But he was not convinced that either
method would achieve the required results.

Gambia's young military rulers yesterday foiled a coup attempt by junior
army officers in the west African tourist haven in which three plotters were
killed in a shootout. Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, the 29-year-old military
strongman who toppled veteran president Sir Dawda Jawara in a bloodless coup
in July, accused the officers of plotting to install a government with no
civilians and planning to blow up fuel storage tanks if they failed. Some
130,000 tourists, half of them British, flock to Gambia's palm-fringed
Atlantic beaches each year. A Britannia Airways Boeing 767 flight en route
to Gambia turned back yesterday after the Foreign Office advised Britons not
to visit the country.

<TEXT>
Russia's parliament yesterday overwhelmingly endorsed a law requiring
foreigners to be tested for the HIV virus before entering the country. Only
three deputies voted against. The draft law, which must still be passed by
the upper house of parliament and the president, would require all
foreigners to submit HIV test certificates or undergo testing at the border.
Western and Russian health officials have criticised the law, warning that
it could prove difficult, and given Russia's shortage of sterilised
syringes, dangerous to implement. Western diplomats are considering lobbying
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to veto the bill, but he may find it
politically awkward to oppose such a broadly popular measure.

A 72-page scientific manuscript written around 1507 by Leonardo da Vinci,
and decorated with over 300 illustrations, sold for Dollars 30.8m (Pounds
19.24m) at Christie's in New York yesterday. There were just two bidders for
the manuscript, the last substantial written work by Leonardo remaining in
private hands. One was a representative of a Milanese bank, who was in the
room; the other was an anonymous telephone bidder who was ultimately
successful. The price was well ahead of the pre-sale estimate of Dollars
10m-plus - and the Pounds 2.4m which secured the manuscript at Christie's in
London in 1980. It was then bought by the oil billionaire the late Armand
Hammer and became known as the Codex Hammer. Before that, and for over 250
years, it had belonged to the Earls of Leicester.
The manuscript contains original ideas on hydraulics and cosmology. It was
sold by the Armand Hammer Museum in Los Angeles to help settle a dispute
over his inheritance. The price was the 10th highest sum ever paid at
auction, and the highest for any work of art other than a painting - beating
the manuscript record of Pounds 8.14m, paid at Sotheby's in 1983 for the
Gospel of Henry the Lion.

<TEXT>
US Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer has extricated himself from a
controversial investment in a Lloyd's of London syndicate by paying about
Dollars 100,000 for insurance to cover all future liabilities. The justice's
investment has forced him to disqualify himself from a number of cases
involving Lloyd's which reached the high court. Mr Breyer promised in his
confirmation hearings last year he would leave the Merrett syndicate as soon
as possible. Because Merrett 418 and other troubled syndicates will be
rolled into one reassurance facility in 1996, thus closing off future risk,
the justice could be paying Dollars 100,000 unnecessarily. However, a large
chunk of the court's cases deal with insurance matters, and Mr Breyer's
expertise on complicated business issues is considered desirable. Mr
Breyer's nomination to the court was opposed by Republican senator Richard
Lugar, who argued that he should be disqualified for showing 'poor judgment'
in the investment.

<TEXT>
South Africa's first moves towards privatisation would probably be through
the sale of surplus government land, Mr F W de Klerk, the deputy president,
said in London yesterday. He suggested there was also scope for running down
state oil reserves. The sale of shares in state companies was not likely to
be the first item on the agenda. Parastatal companies were being put on to a
proper commercial basis, in terms of their board and management structures.
In this way, 'the table was being set for privatisation.' Mr de Klerk said
telecommunications was a dynamic sector, but if he was asked to guess which
company would be privatised first, 'I would put my money on South African
Airways.' Earlier this week, Mr Jay Naidoo, the minister in charge of the
reconstruction and development programme, reiterated his opposition to
selling off either Telkom, transport conglomerate Transnet, or electricity
utility Eskom, saying that they were too valuable to the country's
development goals to be taken out of state hands.

Ireland's coalition appeared on the point of breaking up last night after a
row over the appointment of a new president to the country's high court.
Labour walked out of a cabinet meeting called to discuss the appointment of
the attorney general, Mr Harry Whelehan, to the country's highest legal
office. The larger Fianna Fail party of prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds
then moved to endorse the new appointment in Labour's absence. The crisis
highlights the growing disagreement between the coalition partners over many
areas of social policy.
Mr Whelehan is a conservative judge, criticised for his rulings on several
social issues, notably his handling of a case of a paedophile priest, where
his office is accused of sitting on an application for extradition from
Britain for nine months. Labour party leader and foreign minister Dick
Spring said last night Labour MPs would meet tomorrow to discuss the row.
Last night, most observers were forecasting that Labour, already weakened by
losing another seat in yesterday's by-election in Cork, would seek a
compromise rather than force an early general election.

<TEXT>
Indonesia yesterday bowed to strong US pressure to improve its labour rights
record by announcing a comprehensive programme of reforms and inviting
western trade unions and the International Labour Organisation to help it
develop new industrial relations policies.
After a meeting between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and
Mr Abdul Latief, Indonesia's manpower minister, Mr Kantor said the changes
were 'a step in the right direction'.
However, he said the reforms did not answer all US concerns and would not
comment on whether they went far enough for the US to restore tariff-free
treatment of Indonesian imports under the generalised system of preferences,
which Washington suspended in March in protest at Indonesia's labour record.
The suspension is of greater political than economic significance since it
affects only about Dollars 600m (Pounds 366m) of Indonesian exports to the
US annually and is estimated to have reduced the total by only about Dollars
60m.
The reforms announced yesterday include an annual review of regional minimum
wages, stronger enforcement of pay, health and safety regulations and a more
effective disputes settlement mechanism.
The government plans to allow the All Indonesian Workers' Union greater
independence and to review existing labour legislation. It will launch
workers' education programmes in collaboration with the Australian
government and the ILO and is also ready to work with the AFL/CIO, the
largest US trades union organisation.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Japanese coalition wins tax cut victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's parliament yesterday approved income tax cuts worth Y16,500bn
(Pounds 104bn) over three years, in a move vital to bolstering the painfully
slow economic recovery.
This is a victory for the three-party ruling coalition at a moment when
internal divisions have begun to re-emerge. It had to close ranks and force
the bills to a vote in a parliamentary committee a day earlier, as a result
of an opposition boycott.
The tax cuts are to be followed by a rise in the unpopular sales tax from 3
to 5 per cent from April 1997, needed to adjust the government's shrinking
income tax base to the increasing number of pensioners.
The package, the most radical overhaul of Japan's tax system since the
introduction of sales tax in 1989, will now go to the upper house for final
approval. In theory, it should get through easily, since the coalition of
socialists and conservatives has a majority in both chambers.
Yet a new element of instability has entered Japan's balance of power during
the tax debate of the past few days. A group of socialist dissidents has
started to translate into action tentative plans to leave their party.
Mr Wataru Kubo, the socialists' number two and leader of the dissident
faction, is discussing forming a new party with potential partners in both
government and opposition. Mr Kubo wants to create a small, centre-left
group to hold the balance of power between the two conservative groups - the
Liberal Democratic party and former LDP defectors - who now sit on opposite
sides of parliament.
Ostensibly, opposition parties say they are holding up tax reform to put
pressure on the government to produce firm plans to cut spending on Japan's
vast and powerful bureaucracy, a popular electoral theme. Opposition parties
broadly agree with the tax package, since they proposed something very like
it when in power earlier this year. But with the help of Mr Kubo's
dissidents, they clearly welcome any chance to put the government on the
defensive.
Separately, the Finance Ministry yesterday gave a rare concession in a row
with the postal bank, the world's largest savings institution.
It allowed the postal bank to raise interest paid to ordinary savers by 0.03
percentage points to 1.35 per cent, where it stands more than a point above
private sector banks' demand deposits of 0.25 per cent to 0.3 per cent per
year. The Finance Ministry wanted a smaller rise, to guard against a shift
of funds from banks to postal savings.
The rise, while minute, answers the Postal Ministry's demands in full. It
had asked for permission to raise rates in response to the small rise in
bank deposit rates.

Moslem fundamentalists struck another blow against the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process yesterday when a suicide bomber killed three Israeli soldiers
and wounded four others at a roadblock in the Gaza Strip. Six Palestinians,
including a policeman, were wounded. Two wounded Israelis were last night
reported to be in critical condition. The Islamic Jihad group claimed
responsibility and warned that bombing was a 'first' act of revenge for the
assassination 10 days ago of the Jihad strategist and newspaper publisher
Hani Abed. It also threatened to attack Palestinian police taking part in
joint patrols with the Israelis, who have remained in Gaza to protect 16
Jewish settlements.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, last
night condemned the bombing and promised to take all necessary measures. The
Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Ehud Barak, insisted that the
Palestinian security police must act more rigorously to control the
violence.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Bureaucrats triumph as new chief heads for Bank of Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Japanese press descended on Mr Yasuo Matsushita's home early
yesterday morning, following the announcement of his appointment as the next
head of the Bank of Japan, the governor-designate was apparently nonplussed.
'I haven't been told anything about it,' he said.
But the expression of surprise can have been little more than an early
rehearsal of the new governor's capacity to dissemble - a vital asset for a
central banker. The elevation of the 68-year-old Mr Matsushita has been an
open secret in financial circles for weeks.
The new central bank chief, who takes over from Mr Yasushi Mieno next month,
is a former senior vice-minister in the Ministry of Finance, the
highest-ranking post in Japan's powerful bureaucracy. But unusually for a
Bank of Japan governor, he also has practical experience in the private
sector.
A graduate of Tokyo University, he spent a year studing languages at
Syracuse University in upstate New York. He is understood to be proficient
in several languages including English, German, and, somewhat improbably,
Latin.
He joined the finance ministry in 1950 and rose steadily through the ranks,
spending spells in the banking and budget bureaux. He reached the top job in
1982 and retired from the ministry in 1984.
Mr Matsushita then followed the time-honoured practice of what is known in
Japan as amakudari, or 'descending from heaven', by which lifelong
bureaucrats take up lucrative posts in the private sector. He became
chairman of Taiyo Kobe, a medium-sized commercial bank, and oversaw its
merger with the larger Mitsui Bank. He was appointed chairman of the merged
entity, which changed its name to Sakura Bank in 1992.
As chairman and then executive adviser at Sakura, Mr Matsushita steered the
company through a turbulent period induced by bad loans.
The new governor's direct experience of dealing with the financial sector's
difficulties was regarded as a plus by most analysts in financial markets
yesterday. 'This balance between hands-on private sector management and good
standing with the bureaucracy is a big help,' said Mr Jesper Koll, chief
economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo. 'It will enable him to meet the principal
challenge ahead - micro-management of the financial system.'
That challenge remains a daunting one. Most banks are still heavily burdened
with problem loans, and industry observers expect the Bank of Japan and the
Finance Ministry, which has principal responsibility for banking
supervision, to continue to manage the difficulties piecemeal, assisting
troubled institutions where necessary and encouraging gradual consolidation
within the industry.
But Mr Matsushita will also come under pressure to ease monetary policy
early in his five-year term. Mr Mieno, who took office in 1989, drew fire
from critics for presiding over a restrictive policy that burst the 'bubble
economy' of spiralling asset prices and led to Japan's longest recession
since the second world war. The country is still emerging tentatively from
that downturn, but Mr Mieno has been shifting policy gradually from
expansionary to neutral. This is despite the fact that inflation is
currently negative and the spectre of a sustained fall in prices, increasing
the real cost of servicing loans, haunts the financial sector.
The appointment demonstrates the enduring power of Japan's bureaucracy. The
governorship usually alternates between a finance ministry apparatchik and a
Bank of Japan official. Mr Mieno was a lifelong central banker and the
position was expected to revert to a ministry man (they are never women). It
is understood Mr Matsushita was chosen some months ago.
But in a rare display of political independence, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the
finance minister, objected to the process and asked for consideration of
other candidates. After a protracted and occasionally public quarrel within
the ministry, the bureaucrats' view prevailed.
The ministry's triumph was interpreted by some in financial markets as a
worrying sign that the autonomy of the bank's governor would be compromised.
In the past five years Mr Mieno had established a reputation for taking an
outspoken and independent-minded approach, and as a former Finance Ministry
bureaucrat, Mr Matsushita is not expected to follow suit.
'I'm a bit concerned about his connection with the Finance Ministry and I
wonder how much independence he can have,' said one banker.
But such fears are probably founded on a false premise. The Japanese
economic policy establishment is monolithic and generally has been
dominated, even in Mr Mieno's lively term, by the Finance Ministry. The
influence of a central bank chief is limited, even in the monetary field.
But the incumbent's personality can make a difference at the margins.
According to Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in
Tokyo, 'the main difference between Mr Matsushita and Mr Mieno is likely to
be one of style. The new governor is unlikely to be as doctrinaire as Mr
Mieno and will probably have more sympathy with the position of the banks
and with the aims of the Finance Ministry.'

FT  12 NOV 94 / The APEC Summit: Australia bent on free trade goal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The summit meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders at Bogor near Jakarta next week
must agree a target date for trade liberalisation if it is to be perceived
as a success, Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, said in
Jakarta yesterday.
As an immediate sign that the 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum are serious, they should agree an immediate ban on
introducing new trade barriers such as tariff increases and quota
reductions, he said.
Reinforcing Australia's position yesterday in Sydney, prime minister Paul
Keating said that a free trade agreement among Apec countries could lead to
a tripling of the economic benefit they would receive from the Uruguay Round
trade agreement.
Australian projections, he said, suggest that the annual gain to Apec's
aggregate national income from the Uruguay Round agreement would be around
USDollars 112bn by the year 2002 and that, if free trade was established
among Apec members by 2010, this could rise to Dollars 366bn (Pounds 223bn).
While Australia has much riding on next week - its desire for trade
liberalisation in the region stems from its urgent need to increase its
export performance - its position is a long way from that of countries such
as China, Malaysia and Thailand, which want to focus on the multilateral
efforts in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Many ministers are increasingly convinced that the contentious issue of
setting Apec's future agenda will have to be left to heads of state next
week. Even so, according to one senior Thai official, there is a risk that
the leaders will commit themselves to a process for which inadequate
groundwork has been laid.
Sharp differences remain over whether Apec has taken on a formal
institutional role, or whether it is what Mr Ali Alatas, Indonesia's foreign
minister, yesterday called 'a loose, consultative forum' whose decisions are
non-binding.
Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's trade minister, said Apec had undergone a rapid
and inexorable process of institutionalisation with regular ministerial
meetings on a range of issues. Australia's Mr Evans said Apec had already
taken on the role of a negotiating forum in Seattle last year when it
adopted an agenda for facilitating trade and investment.
Mr MacLaren said he was somewhat unenthusiastic about Apec becoming bogged
down in a debate about target dates for free trade: 'It's the starting date
rather than the completion date that's important.'
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said the target date of 2020 was
'a goal and a vision for free trade'. Much depends, however on whether the
US can resolve differences with China. Mr Kantor has scheduled a meeting
with Ms Wu Yi, his Chinese counterpart, tomorrow, while President Bill
Clinton is to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Jakarta on Monday.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Italy plans two-stage electricity sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday announced plans for a two-stage
privatisation of Enel, the state-owned electricity company, beginning before
June 1995. The sale would be Italy's biggest state sell-off yet.
Responsibility for electricity generation will be passed to one or more new
companies - 100 per cent controlled by the Enel holding company - before the
sale of shares begins, the treasury, industry and budget ministers said
yesterday.
Enel's transmission and distribution activities will be formally merged into
the company.
The decision should end months of squabbling about whether to split up the
company into regional operations or to maintain an integrated structure.
Enel is responsible for 80 per cent of Italy's electricity production and it
has a dominant position in distribution and transmission, making it one of
the world's largest electricity companies.
Within three years of flotation, Enel will have to sell off an unspecified
share of its production capacity to reduce its dominant position.
The group's 'dispatching' activities, regulating the transmission of
domestically produced and imported electricity, will be split from the group
and put under the control of a new public body.
The management and accounting operations of the transmission and
distribution activities will be kept separate, in line with EU rules on the
liberalisation of the sector.
Ministers said they had also agreed to preserve a single set of electricity
tariffs for the whole of Italy.
Sources indicated that the government was also set to reduce substantially
the length of the concession granted to Enel, which the law currently sets
at 99 years, in order to increase competition.
Analysts estimate that Enel could be worth between L20,000bn (Pounds 7.9bn)
and L30,000bn, although its value will depend on the extent to which it has
to reduce its production capacity. A final decision on how much of Enel to
sell off will not be taken until much nearer the date of the sale. Its
shares are not yet listed on the stock exchange.
Yesterday's decision does not have to be submitted for parliamentary
approval.
A decision will be taken later on the form of regulatory authority for the
sector.
Robert Graham adds from Rome: Italy's government yesterday called a
parliamentary vote of confidence on measures in the 1995 budget giving an
amnesty to property constructed without proper planning permission.
The move came on the eve of a huge protest demonstration organised by
Italy's powerful trades unions against the budget and measures to cut
benefits. Up to 1m people are expected to gather in Rome today as a
follow-up to last month's four-hour general strike.
A government spokesman insisted the confidence motion in the chamber of
deputies was intended to speed up discussion of the amnesty - an essential
revenue raising measure in the budget.
However, the rightwing coalition has a majority of 120 in the chamber of
deputies and the confidence motion looked designed to unify the government
at a moment when the populist Northern League is talking openly of its
demise.

Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday claimed to have recaptured all the land
seized in a Moslem offensive in northwestern Bosnia after giving their
leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, sweeping powers to declare a state of war.
In the aftermath of a two-week Moslem offensive, partly supported by Bosnian
Croat forces, the Bosnian Serb military appears to have regained the
initiative over their outgunned foes.
Serb forces yesterday said their 'fierce counter-offensive had completely
destroyed' Bosnian government units round the Bihac pocket, the Moslem
enclave which is a United Nations-designated safe area, reported Bosnian
Serb sources.
After his assembly ended its three-day marathon session in Pale, the
abandoned ski resort above Sarajevo, Mr Karadzic said his forces would
'neutralise the Moslems' in the Bihac enclave.
Serb forces from Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia just over
the frontier, have joined the Bosnian Serbs.
Yesterday they claimed to have sandwiched the mainly Moslem army in Bihac,
reported the Bosnian Serb news agency.
The Krajina Serbs are believed to take orders from Belgrade. Their
stepped-up military involvement may indicate that Serbia proper is relaxing
its embargo against the Bosnian Serbs.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed a political and economic
blockade, including military material and fuel, in August after Bosnian Serb
leaders rejected a peace plan.
In a letter to the Serbian president, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN civilian
official in former Yugoslavia, yesterday called on Belgrade to stop the
Krajina Serbs from intervening in Bihac.
Local analysts say an air raid launched by Krajina Serbs against Bihac on
Wednesday probably had support from Belgrade. Fourteen people were wounded
when a Serb fighter jet hit a munitions factory in Bihac.
Nato says the flight did not appear to have entered Bosnian airspace, which
would mean the violation of a UN no-fly zone over Bosnia.
If it fired the missile from the Croatian border, it would indicate a high
degree of expertise.
Serb forces yesterday reportedly crossed the River Una, advancing towards
Cazin and Velika Kladusa, once the stronghold of ousted rebel Moslem leader
Fikret Abdic.
UN officials said that forces loyal to Mr Abdic were reported to be massing
just over the border in Serb-held parts of Croatia, their self-styled state
of Krajina.
Other reports said Krajina Serbs were masquerading as Mr Abdic's 'army'.
Bosnian radio yesterday reported fierce fighting in the region, saying Serb
had launched infantry attacks on all fronts.

Any undecided Swedish Social Democrats looking for guidance in tomorrow's
referendum on joining the European Union were offered little help yesterday
by Aftonbladet, the trade union-owned popular newspaper that is the main
national voice of the party.
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, and Ms Mona Sahlin, his deputy,
smiled out of a prominent advertisement paid for by the party urging a Yes
vote. 'A Yes to the EU means that you believe in co-operation to manage the
Swedish welfare system,' they wrote, appealing to voters on the traditional
core issue of Swedish social democracy.
But further on, an even bigger ad, also paid for by the party, featured
their cabinet colleague Ms Margareta Winberg, the agriculture minister. 'For
women's right to their own job and economic independence - vote No,' she
declared.
The split on the EU within Social Democratic ranks is a key reason why the
outcome of tomorrow's referendum has been in such doubt. As it is easily the
biggest political party in the land, victory for either side is all but
impossible without winning majority support among Social Democrats.
Mr Carlsson believes he can capture that majority; but to avoid alienating
his own supporters he has allowed anti-EU party members a free hand, even
giving them party funds to do so. The presence on the No side of such
mainstream figures as Ms Winberg has helped add weight to the anti-EU
campaign otherwise dominated by leaders of small political parties, such as
Ms Gudrun Schyman of the Left party, and Mr Birger Schlaug of the
Environment party.
With the help of articulate figures such as Ms Agnetha Stark, a professor of
business economics who last night headed the No side in the final television
debate, the No campaign has managed to hold its own against the pro-EU
establishment in the welter of campaigning, leafleting and media attention
that has engulfed Sweden recently.
State-run Swedish Radio's main news and talk channel has barely deviated
from the subject.
Throughout this torrent, the No campaign has plugged away at its main
objections: that the EU is an undemocratic, bureaucracy-driven union that
will erode Sweden's independence, compromise its neutrality, entrench
unemployment, undermine the welfare system and reverse the high levels of
women's equality and environmental standards.
The message appears to have been most effective among women and young
voters. Swedish women are employed heavily in the public sector: many feel
EU membership will lead to greater pressure on Sweden to reduce its public
services and polls show a majority of women ready to vote No. Likewise,
young people, bearing the brunt of Sweden's 13 per cent unemployment rate,
are susceptible to the argument that the record of EU member states on
employment is dismal.
Ultimately, however, it is a mighty task for the No side to defeat the
experience and authority of Mr Carlsson, Mr Carl Bildt, the leader of the
conservative opposition, the trade union leadership, every well-known
Swedish industrialist, the farm organisations and every big Swedish
newspaper. If the outcome is No, the Swedish establishment will have been
humiliated.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Brussels launches 24-hour Eurofraud hotline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fight against European Union fraud is being taken to the masses next
week with the launch of a 24-hour free telephone service for people wanting
to shop their friends or business contacts over illicit use of Brussels
subsidies.
People dialling special hotline phone numbers will be answered by a computer
in Belgium which asks them in soothing tones whether they want to 'help the
(European) commission to fight fraud'.
It then leaves space for messages, which the commission hopes will enable
officials to follow up leads related to financial irregularities.
These are thought to drain between 2 per cent and 10 per cent from the EU's
Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) annual budget.
Informers phoning from Britain dial 0800 963595, after which they are spoken
to initially in French and then by a recorded voice talking in English with
an Irish lilt.
The computer at the headquarters of Uclaf, the EC's anti-fraud squad, has
been programmed so it responds in one of eight languages depending on where
the person is dialling from.
The service will apply to the whole of the EU, except for Greece, which
cannot be connected because its telephone lines are too poor.
The hotline is being launched ahead of Tuesday's annual report of the
Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog.
This is likely to list a range of projects in areas such as agriculture,
training and road building where money has gone missing or has been spent
inappropriately.
Mr Per Brix Knudsen, Uclaf's director, said the phone service would help to
expand his 60-strong unit's 'network of knowledge'.
But officials have no idea to what degree the EU's 320m citizens will want
to use it.
As a rough estimate, they reckon 10 people from each country will dial up
every day - but this takes no account of how strongly people in different
countries feel about fraud, nor of whether garrulous Italians can be relied
on to pick up the phone more readily than restrained UK citizens.
Uclaf is also slightly worried that the service could become a focus for
cranks.
'We are taking the project seriously; we don't want neighbours' gossip,'
said an official. To preserve confidentiality, the answering machine will
not ask for names or addresses; and if people want to leave them, officials
will keep identities secret.
The hotline numbers for the other countries are:
Belgium, 0800 12426
Denmark, 800 18495
France, 0591 7295
Germany, 0130 820595
Ireland, 1800 553295

FT  12 NOV 94 / Sleaze claims anger Gonzalez: Tom Burns reports on the
allegations against Spain's prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Callers put on hold by the busy switchboard at Madrid's El Mundo newspaper
are treated to The Beatles in their Sergeant Pepper mode and to John Lennon
singing: 'I heard the news today, oh boy. . .' El Mundo, a five-year-old
investigative daily in which Britain's Guardian newspaper is a minor
shareholder, has been making news for the past week in Spain as well as
reporting it.
It claims to have uncovered a corruption scandal involving Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, and the allegations have turned the suave and veteran prime
minister into an angry and potentially vulnerable politician.
In a television 'fireside' chat late on Thursday night, Mr Gonzalez darkly
hinted at conspiracies to destabilise the economy and eject him from office.
Speaking from his book-lined study and flanked by one the bonsai trees that
he lovingly tends, he told the nation: 'The only reason for these types of
campaigns is that there are those who think the recovery of our country will
favour the government.'
The prime minister did not mention El Mundo directly, nor did he disclose
who was conspiring to upset the 'climate of tranquility', but he insisted
that there was a 'minority' determined to create public alarm 'even at the
cost of economic recovery'.
El Mundo's editor, Mr Pedro J Ramrez, was nonplussed as he huddled with his
journalists to watch the broadcast in the paper's newsroom. 'I don't know
how this is all going to end but my instinct tells me there is a lot more to
all of this. It took us two years to break the Ibercorp story last spring,'
he said.
Ibercorp was a top people's private bank run by friends of Mr Mariano Robio,
then governor of the Bank of Spain. A series of reports by El Mundo led to
the downfall of the governor, who was briefly imprisoned this year.
Mr Gonzalez has previously been unscathed by the corruption scandals which
over the years have enveloped his Socialist party, members of his government
and senior officials of his administration.
But now he is for the first time in the thick of sleaze allegations. The
latest row centres on allegations by the newspaper that the prime minister's
brother-in-law, Mr Francisco Palomino, was favoured by government contracts.
They have stung Mr Gonzalez into an unprecedented counterattack to defend
his integrity.
The chief allegation is that Mr Palomino, a Seville businessman married to
Mr Gonzalez's sister Lola, profitably sold a troubled boilermaking business
owned by his family to a company that subsequently hired him as a
non-executive director. The company went on to obtain a contract to install
electronic systems in a nuclear-proof bunker built alongside the prime
minister's official residence.
'Our first report was that Palomino had made a pile on a Seville property
deal and we thought it was a typical episode of speculation in Andalucia (Mr
Gonzalez's home region) by someone who had the right connections,' said Mr
Ramrez. 'We were prepared to leave it at that and it was only when Gonzalez
got so furious about the story that we started investigating further and
came up with the government contracts.'
Cabinet members and senior Socialists have rallied to support Mr Gonzalez in
the face of the allegations, as have leaders of the Basque and Catalan
nationalist parties whose votes keep the minority Socialist government in
power.
The government's spokesman has issued a stream of detailed statements in
recent days rebutting point by point as 'falsehoods' the El Mundo
allegations. In his TV broadcast, Mr Gonzalez asserted: 'I have never taken
personal advantage of my position.'
It was a vintage persuasive performance by a master of communication skills.
The prime minister said there was not a shred of truth in the allegations,
declared that he was not prepared to admit criticism that was 'based on
lies', promised that 'life will be very difficult for those who are
corrupt', and accused those who attempted to drag his family into the
political arena of 'moral cowardice.'
Separately the government has asked the state auditors to examine all
government contracts which could involve companies associated with Mr
Palomino, who has been urged by members of the government to seek legal
advice over possible action against El Mundo.
Most Spaniards appear to believe in the personal honesty of the prime
minister, who in 1993 was re-elected for a fourth consecutive four-year
term.
However, the fear among Mr Gonzalez's aides is that voters will blame him
for the climate of corruption that has grown up during his tenure of power.

Germany's centre-right coalition partners yesterday completed talks on a new
government programme in record time, clearing the way for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's re-election by parliament on Tuesday.
The parties have agreed on trimming bureaucracy and encouraging
privatisation at state and municipal level, and attempting to cut the tax
burden.
A final sticking point - measures to make it easier for foreigners to obtain
German nationality - has been agreed in outline.
The parties were due to finalise details of the foreigners question over the
weekend before presenting the coalition's programme on Monday.
The issue has pitted the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) against the
Christian Social Union (CSU), the conservative sister party of Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which had vowed to fight the changes to
the last.
The partners began negotiating the new programme for the next four years
soon after the October 16 general election, in which their majority fell
from 134 seats to 10. The negotiations were completed in just under three
weeks, the fastest set of coalition talks since the second world war.
There were no details yesterday about the composition of the new cabinet.
Given his slim majority, Mr Kohl is eager to avoid upsetting his partners
before Tuesday's vote.
The narrow majority and the strength of the opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD) in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber which must approve
legislation, mean that the coalition parties have been unwilling to pinpoint
detailed policies.
Efforts will be made to cut the tax burden, although the FDP was unable to
insist on a date for the removal of the so-called solidarity surcharge, a
7.5 per cent income tax to fund investments in eastern Germany.
The parties agreed that they would decide whether or not to scrap the tax
after seeing a review of key economic data.
Bringing down unemployment from its present level of 3.5m is another
priority, although the government has not spelt out how it will do this.
Laws to combat crime will be reviewed and further measures undertaken to
improve co-ordination against crime across Europe.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Clinton looks to foreign policy continuity
</HEADLINE>

Even if President Bill Clinton had not wanted to stop enforcing the United
Nations arms embargo against Bosnia, this week's sweeping Republican victory
in congressional elections would have made it much more difficult to avoid
the decision.
Congress voted in August for an ultimatum: if the UN had not agreed to lift
the embargo multilaterally, US participation in its enforcement must end by
November 15.
Mr Clinton's decision will comply with Congress's demand three days ahead of
its deadline. But the White House is well aware an alternative and much
tougher resolution was sponsored by Senator Robert Dole, who will take over
as leader of the new Senate majority when the next Congress takes office in
January.
Administration officials insist there will be continuity in foreign policy,
despite the change of power in Congress. Indeed, some of Mr Clinton's
advisers hope that foreign policy will be one field he can till on his own,
since his freedom in domestic policy will be sharply curtailed by a
Republican Congress.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, attending the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation meeting in Jakarta, spelt out seven policy objectives
on which he said he was confident of broad bipartisan support, though he
conceded there could be 'tactical' differences with the
Republican-controlled Congress on implementation.
Mr Christopher said the US policy would remain unchanged on:
Economic security and open international trade
A comprehensive Middle East peace agreement
Nuclear non-proliferation
Support for Nato and European integration
Ukraine and other independent states of the former Soviet Union
Commitment to a continuing US role as a Pacific power
New opportunities to deal with 'global' issues, notably terrorism, drugs and
organised crime.
A State Department spokesman said Mr Christopher had decided to spell out
these points clearly after being questioned closely about future US policy
by other Apec foreign ministers over dinner on Thursday.
There is plenty of room for conflict between the administration and
Congress. Although the Republicans have over the last 15 years mostly argued
for a free presidential hand in foreign policy, that changed noticeably when
they lost the White House in 1992.
Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, expected to become chairman of the
House of Representatives foreign affairs committee, is a moderate on foreign
policy issues, most interested in Israel, human rights and drug trafficking.
Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois is more conservative, and could play a
larger role in shaping Republican policy, if he does not take over the
chairmanship of the judiciary committee; but he, too, could be described as
an internationalist.
But moderate is the last word anyone would choose to describe Senator Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, who will take over as chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee. Mr Helms has already promised to work to cut
the tiny US foreign aid budget and US contributions to the UN - on which it
is already wildly in arrears.
Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, number two Republican on the foreign
affairs committee, may play an important role in moderating Mr Helms. He has
formed a strong alliance with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, a conservative
Democrat who seems likely to retain at least some of the influence he has
held in Congress as chairman of the armed services committee.
One other weapon of which Mr Helms has made full use in opposition, and
which he may be expected to wield freely as chairman, is the Senate's power
to confirm ambassadors and other top officials. He has already delayed the
appointment of Mr Robert Pastor as ambassador to Panama, and that nomination
now seems likely to die.
Mr Clinton, who campaigned against Mr Bush as the 'anywhere but America'
president, has spent more days outside the US in his first two years in
office than his predecessor. Over the next two years, he may spend even more
time abroad, if he finds presidents and prime ministers more congenial than
Senator Dole or Senator Helms.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Divide grows on France's right

<TEXT>
Several senior members of France's Gaullist RPR party are set to boycott
today's special party meeting called to endorse the candidacy of Mr Jacques
Chirac for next spring's presidential election.
The move highlights the widening divisions within France's political right,
splitting support between Mr Chirac and his Gaullist rival Mr Edouard
Balladur, the prime minister, who is an an undeclared presidential
candidate.
Mr Philippe Seguin, the president of the National Assembly, and Mr Charles
Pasqua, the interior minister, have written to Mr Chirac criticising his
decision to seek endorsement of his candidacy following last week's
announcement that he would run for the French presidency. 'We want to
guarantee the unity of our movement. The meeting and the endorsement is
incompatible with the spirit of our institutions,' they said.
Mr Seguin said he would not attend the meeting, while Mr Pasqua is in Saudi
Arabia on an official visit. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, government spokesman and an
ally of Mr Balladur, has also said he will not be present. The prime
minister, who is expected to announce his candidacy for the presidential
elections at the beginning of next year, is spending the weekend at his
holiday home in Chamonix.
The deepening divisions on the political right have played into the hands of
Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist President of the European Commission, who
is weighing a bid for the French presidency. A poll published yesterday in
the daily Le Parisien has Mr Delors moving ahead of Mr Balladur with an
approval rating of 50 per cent. Mr Balladur's approval rating fell by 6
points to 45 per cent, ahead of Mr Chirac, who stands at 35 per cent.
The poll is the latest to show a weakening of support for Mr Balladur, whose
government has been shaken by a series of corruption scandals prompting the
resignation of two ministers since July.
Mr Michel Roussin, the co-operation minister, who is responsible for
overseas aid, has also been linked to a corruption investigation. French
press reports claim that he may step down within the next few days in
response to allegations that he was connected to a scheme to raise illicit
funds for the RPR party.
Mr Roussin has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Sarkozy said last week that Mr
Roussin was 'still a minister', but added that any minister involved in a
corruption investigation would have to resign.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Sega profit hit as Sonic boom time comes to an end

Sonic the Hedgehog has fallen on hard times. Sega Enterprises, the Japanese
creator of the video games hero, announced a sharp fall in first-half
profits yesterday after a decline in demand for video and computer games,
one of the fastest-growing consumer markets of the early 1990s.
Sega saw profits before tax and extraordinary items fall to Y16.32bn (Pounds
103.29m) in the first six months of 1994, from Y28.58bn in the same period
last year, on sales down by 25 per cent to Y151bn.
The company warned of a further fall in sales for the full year and a 35 per
cent decline in profits before tax to Y27.6bn from Y42.5bn in 1993.
The games market took off in the late 1980s when Sega and Nintendo, its
chief competitor, announced the first wave of 16-bit cartridge console games
 -such as the Sonic games. Worldwide sales soared from Pounds 4.6bn in 1989
to Pounds 13.34bn last year, according to Durlacher, the London securities
house.
The industry's difficulties began last Christmas when sales slowed in
western Europe and the US.
Demand for 16-bit hardware and software declined as consumers awaited the
launch of the next wave of more sophisticated 32-bit consoles, using compact
discs.
These machines combine superior sound and images to create more exciting
games than the old formats, such as Sega's Sonic and his arch-rivals,
Nintendo's Super Mario Bros.
Mr Frank Herman, deputy chairman of Sega Europe, said: 'For over a year, our
customers have known that a new generation of hardware was coming on to the
market and have regarded our current technology as outdated.'
New 32-bit consoles, including Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, will be
launched next week in Japan. Nintendo is pinning its hopes this Christmas on
Donkey Kong Country, a 16-bit computer-generated game, until next autumn's
launch of its new Ultra 64 games.
Once the new machines come on stream, the games market is expected to return
to growth. Mr David Tabizel, multimedia analyst at Durlacher, forecasts that
the global market will rise from Pounds 13.7bn this year to Pounds 20bn by
1998.

FT  12 NOV 94 / Mayhew hopeful on talks despite shooting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN, DAVID OWEN and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he still hoped talks
between the UK government and republican leaders would start before
Christmas despite Thursday's murder of a post office worker.
Amid continuing uncertainty over whether the two men arrested after the
armed raid in Newry were active IRA members, Sir Patrick said: 'The peace
process is on course and I hope it stays on course.' Talks would happen,
though, only if IRA violence was 'shown to be permanently at an end'.
He said: 'If this miserable and wicked episode . . . shows anything at all,
it shows the evil use to which illegally held arms are put, and that has got
to be dealt with straight away.'
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, insisted yesterday that the 10-week-old
Ulster ceasefire remained intact. Mr Pat Doherty, Sinn Fein vice-president,
said the shooting of Mr Frank Kerr, 53, was wrong. But he did not know
whether the IRA had been involved.
He added: 'Any military operation of any nature should not be carried out
during this ceasefire. That is the commitment that the IRA has given - and I
am convinced that is the commitment they are prepared to stand over.'
As the Royal Ulster Constabulary appealed for information on another man
believed to have taken part in the attack, Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist
security spokesman, said he thought four people were involved.
He said three had served prison sentences for terrorist offences. 'It will
be interesting to see what, if any, action the IRA intends to take against
the third and fourth members of the gang who escaped.'
As the Irish government joined London in emphasising the importance of
keeping the peace process on course, it emerged that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn
Fein president, will fly to London next week. It will be his first to
mainland Britain since a ban on him was lifted last month.
The Irish government is likely to seek further meetings with Sinn Fein over
the next couple of days.
With the need to dismantle paramilitary arsenals now firmly at the top of
the two governments' agenda, the issue is expected to feature prominently
when Sir Patrick Mayhew meets Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in
Dublin on Monday.
Mr Spring denied that the Irish government had acted too quickly in drawing
up plans to release nine IRA prisoners.

FT  12 NOV 94 / US move to ease Bosnia arms ban angers Nato allies: France
calls for emergency meeting on embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US sought yesterday to smooth over a rift with its allies after Britain
and France voiced strong concern over President Bill Clinton's decision to
stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against Bosnia.
Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told Mr Warren Christopher, the
US Secretary of State, that France was 'deeply worried by this unilateral
decision that we can only regret'.
Mr Juppe called for an emergency meeting of the international contact group
on Bosnia, which consists of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, also described the US move as
worrying but his spokesman said UK fears were eased by a telephone
conversation with Mr Christopher.
The US secretary of state told Mr Hurd that although US ships and aircraft
would be withdrawn from the embargo enforcement, US officers assigned to
Nato - which oversees the operation - would continue their duties.
Mr Willy Claes, the new secretary-general of Nato, confirmed that the
alliance still intended to enforce the embargo without direct US assistance.
Defence officials in Washington said US ships and aircraft would stop taking
part in efforts to block ships carrying arms to Bosnia from early tomorrow.
US ships will remain in the region to enforce the blockade against
Montenegro, an ally of Serbia.
A senior US defence official said the US measures did 'not amount to a
unilateral end of the Bosnian arms embargo'.
He said the US would not supply arms to Bosnia, and would still bar US
citizens from doing so, in compliance with the UN resolution that
established the embargo.
If a US vessel intercepted a ship carrying arms bound for the Bosnian
government, it would allow it to go on its way and make no report to its
Nato allies.
Nor would it pass on other intelligence on arms shipments bound for Bosnia.
'We are now required to identify that information as US-only and we are
obligated by the legislation not to forward that information through normal
channels as part of the Nato structure and the UN structure,' a senior
military official said.
UK officials said the US routinely shared satellite information with its
Nato allies, and provided Britain with higher quality information under a
bilateral arrangement. It seemed unlikely that this co-operation would be
called into question.
In Moscow, the Russian parliament criticised the US move and said it 'would
lead to chaos and arbitrary behaviour in international relations'. It also
criticised the White House for being swayed by domestic political concerns,
a reference to this week's US elections.
The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government accused Washington of siding with one
party in a civil war and expressed 'deep regret and concern' over the
decision. However, a Bosnian Serb official dismissed the move as a
'diplomatic game about something which is unimportant, because the Moslems
are already armed.'
Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, hailed Washington's move as
a 'turning-point in the understanding of the Bosnian problem.'
The situation in Bosnia worsened as the city of Mostar, already ravaged by
last year's Croat-Moslem conflict, came under Serb shelling and heavy
fighting raged nearby.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Restructure costs drive Logitech
into deficit
</HEADLINE>

   LAUSANNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Logitech, the world's largest maker of computer pointing devices (mice and
trackballs), has reported a SFr31.6m (Dollars 25m) loss in the six months to
September 30, mainly because of a SFr24m restructuring charge.
The Swiss group, struggling to bring down costs in response to a price war
in the worldwide personal computer industry, is curtailing production in the
US and Ireland with the loss of some 500 jobs, a fifth of its total
workforce.
Sales were down 16.2 per cent to SFr192.2m in the first half in spite of a
20 per cent rise in volume. Mr Daniel Borel, chairman, said prices of
pointing devices and scanners, the group's other product line, had fallen by
between 30 and 40 per cent during the period.
Excluding extraordinary items, the loss reached SFr7.6m, compared with a
profit of SFr4.7m in the first half of fiscal 1993-94.
Mr Borel acknowledged the figures were 'troubling', and admitted the group
had not responded quickly enough to the intensifying challenge from low-cost
east Asian-based production. It had also excessively diversified.
Production of commodity items would now be concentrated in China, and
high-technology products would be made in Taiwan. The group had given up an
attempt to break into the market for sound systems for computers.
Mr Borel confirmed rumours that the directors had considered seeking a
partner to secure the company's future, but decided to 'keep fighting'.
Operating costs were now better aligned with those of competitors and the
balance sheet was strong with SFr83.9m in shareholders' funds at the end of
September.
In the second quarter, the operating loss had been cut to SFr1m after losses
of SFr4.1m and SFr4.6m in the two previous quarters.
He said the remainder of the current fiscal year would be 'delicate' because
of production transfers and redundancies.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Watchdog to probe Carrefour
share fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French market watchdog yesterday launched a formal inquiry into
Carrefour, one of the country's leading hypermarket chains, in the wake of a
sharp drop in the company's share price following rumours on the Paris
bourse.
The rumours appeared to be the cause of a drop of up to 8 per cent in the
price of the shares yesterday, following a decline the day before of 4.7 per
cent.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse confirmed last night it was
investigating Carrefour on two grounds: the market in the shares, and two
pieces of price-sensitive information it had received two days earlier. It
refused to give details of what the information concerned.
However, Carrefour said the share price fall appeared to have been caused by
two rumours: that it was to announce an increase in its capital in an effort
to buy Caro, a distribution company, and that it had offered bribes to the
Communist party.
The group flatly denied the two rumours yesterday and said it would welcome
and co-operate fully with an inquiry by the COB.
It said it had no plans to buy Caro, with which it said it had no
connection.
The company added that it had no detailed knowledge of the background to any
bribes, but firmly rejected suggestions any money had been paid to the
Communist Party.

</HEADLINE>

   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amnesty International yesterday accused the Nigerian government of jailing
hundreds and killing dozens of opponents to stifle political activity, write
Paul Adams in Lagos and Reuter.
The human rights pressure group said it considered Chief Moshood Abiola,
winner of the 1993 presidential elections but imprisoned by the military
government, as a prisoner of conscience.
'The country is now facing one of the most serious human rights crises for
decades, triggered by these killings of critics, imprisonment for treason of
the president-elect of Nigeria and the detentions of ethnic group leaders,
prominent trade unionists and opposition politicians,' it said.
Amnesty called on the Nigerian government to release all prisoners of
conscience and abolish legislation allowing indefinite detention without
charge or trial.
It accused the government of arresting hundreds of demonstrators, detaining
government critics and using 'lethal force' to crush pro-democracy protests
and strikes.
'The military government of General Sani Abacha has shown its contempt for
the rule of law and internationally recognised human rights by silencing the
opposition not only in the press and the streets, but also in the courts,'
it said.
Amnesty also accused the government of repressing the impoverished Ogoni
people of southeast Nigeria who have protested against pollution by oil
companies.
Meanwhile, Nigeria's constitutional conference has been extended by at least
two months until next January.
Delegates at the conference in Abuja will review proposed changes to the
constitution until December 8, then begin to approve a draft constitution on
January 9.
The conference was set up by Gen Sani Abacha's military regime, which seized
power after the annulment of last year's presidential election, to pave the
way for the promised transfer to elected civilian rule.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three white Zimbabwean farmers whose land was earmarked by the state for
forcible seizure for resettling landless blacks have lost a High Court case
to stop the government acquiring their farms, Reuter reports from Harare.
In a judgment made available to reporters yesterday, Justice Godfrey
Chidyausiku ruled that a 1992 law giving the state sweeping powers to seize
farms for resettlement did not violate Zimbabwe's constitution.
In his 22-page ruling, Justice Chidyausiku said: 'The constitution
recognises and codifies the state's right to compulsorily acquire property,
and indeed elevates the individual's entitlement to compensation for
compulsory acquisition to the level of a fundamental right.'
The farmers - Alistair Clothered Davis, Michael Anthony Clark and Erna
Rhodena McClean - had argued that since the state offered no compensation
when it designated land for seizure, and only compensated on transfer, the
concept of earmarking land contradicted the constitution.
But the court upheld the state's submission that it was exercising its
regulatory powers of earmarking land pending future acquisition.
Zimbabwe's population of 10m includes 100,000 whites.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Egypt to resume talks with IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt is to resume formal talks with the International Monetary Fund this
year, to try to break a deadlock between the two sides over devaluation of
the Egyptian pound.
A Fund mission is expected in Cairo before Christmas to discuss devaluation
and a raft of other issues, including reform of Egypt's tax and trade
policies and the pace of its privatisation programme.
Agreement to give new impetus to formal negotiations followed brief talks in
Cairo this week between Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, and Mr
Stanley Fisher, the new IMF managing director. Direct negotiations foundered
in July when a team of Egyptian ministers failed to reach agreement on
devaluation and a package of related issues in Washington.
The IMF has been pressing Egypt to devalue the pound as part of its
three-year-old structural adjustment policies, saying the currency is as
much as 40 per cent overvalued and seriously impedes attempts to generate
export-led growth. The pound has been held at around EPounds 3.38 to the
dollar for the duration of the IMF and World Bank stabilisation and
structural reforms.
The government has refused, saying devaluation would shatter hard-won
confidence in the currency, which in turn has contributed to strong inflows
of expatriated Egyptian money and reserves now topping Dollars 16bn.
Neither Egyptian nor IMF officials would comment on this week's talks, but
it is understood no substantive agreement was reached other than to resume
negotiations.
After the IMF talks, the government announced plans to sell shares in 17
public sector companies worth around EPounds 1.5bn (Dollars 440m) by January
17 to give a push to its hitherto sluggish privatisation programme.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Bolivia needs Dollars 2bn to stem cocaine output
</HEADLINE>

   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia needs at least Dollars 2bn in foreign aid to begin eradicating its
illegal but lucrative cocaine industry, the country's president said
yesterday, AP reports from La Paz.
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said at a news conference that the
government had a plan to replace coca leaf production - the raw material
processed into cocaine - with other cash crops and industry.
'We cannot wait for the demand side of cocaine to be resolved; it is
important that we deal with the production side,' he said.
'It is more convenient to invest Dollars 1m in development and substituting
coca fields than Dollars 1bn in reducing demand and combating drug
traffickers.'
The success of the government's plan is dependent on foreign aid of at least
Dollars 2bn and the consensus of Bolivian society, Mr Sanchez de Lozada
said. The plan would convert the main coca leaf producing region of Chapare
into an industrial park to be developed with the active participation of
private business.
A meeting of the country's top political leaders is set for next week to
discuss and reach a consensus on this plan.
At least 300,000 people in the Chapare region depend on coca cultivation for
their livelihood. Coca leaf has been grown for centuries in Bolivia; it is
used as a tea for religious rites and chewed by farmers and miners to help
combat the effects of high altitude and hunger.
Most of the leaf devoted to traditional uses is grown on the eastern slopes
of the Andes, while the coca for cocaine - about 40,000 hectares - is grown
in the Chapare, a lush sub-tropical region in the middle of the country.
Coca leaf farmers say that no other crop provides the income and assured
markets and have resisted switching from coca to other crops until they are
convinced they can earn the same.
The plan includes converting fields to other crops, relocating farmers to
other regions of the country and establishing industrial plants in areas not
suitable for farming. The government has begun negotiations with the
Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the United Nations to
finance this programme.
Bolivia, an impoverished country of 7m people, produces an estimated quarter
of the world's coca leaf that is processed into cocaine.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Gonzalez backed on favouritism allegations
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez's minority government yesterday won the support of its
Catalonian and Basque political allies against allegations that the Spanish
prime minister had favoured the business dealings of his brother-in-law.
Leaders of the Catalan and Basque nationalist parties, whose votes keep the
ruling Socialist party in power, endorsed the prime minister and accused the
opposition conservative Partido Popular of seeking to make political capital
out of false corruption allegations.
In an unprecedented cross-fire of accusations and denials, the Madrid
newspaper El Mundo has been printing front page stories connecting Mr
Francisco Palomino, a Seville businessman married to Mr Gonzalez's sister,
to government contracts, and on a daily basis the prime minister's spokesman
has issued lengthy rebuttals of El Mundo's allegations.
The newspaper alleges that Mr Palomino sold a bankrupt boilermaking business
owned by his family at a considerable profit to a company that subsequently
hired him as a non-executive director and was engaged by the government to
install electronic systems in a nuclear-proof bunker built alongside Mr
Gonzalez's official residence.
The allegations have been attacked as 'falsehoods' in a succession of
statements issued by the prime minister's office and they have been called a
'pack of lies' by Mr Gonzalez. 'I have never shown favouritism, nor do I
intend to, nor have I ever been asked to,' said the prime minister.
Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader, pledged to continue
supporting the Socialist party because it had won the 1993 elections and in
order to ensure the 'governability' of the nation. Mr Pujol, whose executive
in Catalonia also faces a series of corruption scandals, some of which are
linked to jailed Barcelona financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, said he opposed
the PP because the conservatives were unsympathetic to Catalan authonomy and
lacked alternative policies to those of the government.
Mr Inaki Anasagasti, the parliamentary spokesman of the Basque nationalists,
accused the conservative opposition of 'bully boy tactics' for backing El
Mundo's allegations and said he stood by the 'honesty of Felipe Gonzalez'.
The endorsements by the government's political allies suggest that the PP,
who scored an outright victory over the Socialist party in June's European
elections and maintain a 10-point lead in opinion polls, are no nearer
unseating Mr Gonzalez. But the jury is out on whether the prime minister,
who last night was due to address the nation in a TV 'fireside' chat, has
won the propaganda battle with the public over his credibility.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Thomson denies radar claims

Thomson-CSF of France yesterday denied allegations that in the course of
winning its recent contract to supply Austria with 22 radars worth Sch1.2bn
(Pounds 68m) it had tried to bribe a member of the governing Social Democrat
party. The Austrian defence ministry confirmed that the Vienna prosecutor's
office had been asked to investigate allegations in yesterday's edition of
the weekly 'News' that Thomson-CSF's local representative had offered a
Sch22m bribe to a Social Democrat official who refused the offer and
informed the party's head, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky. The ministry said the
award of the contract to the French electronics company, with Steyr as its
local partner, was because its radars were 'clearly superior' to those of
the rival consortium of Ericsson of Sweden and Schrack of Austria.

FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms buzz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Telecoms shares had another hyperactive day, with Cable and Wireless losing
further ground and BT dragged lower as slight disappointment with the
interim dividend triggered profit-taking. The two stocks' combined trading
volume was almost 20m shares.
BT finished 4 1/2 easier at 388 1/2 p, with most analysts pinpointing the
interim payout - up 6 per cent, after a 6.3 per cent increase for last
year's final dividend - as the reason for the sell-off in the face of
generally strong trading trends. According to Hoare Govett, second-quarter
underlying profits rose 5 per cent after 3.7 per cent in the first three
months.
C&amp;W fell 6 to 386p as analysts got to grips with the management shake-up and
fierce margins squeeze under way at the group's Mercury arm.
Mobile phones group Vodafone managed to ride above the bearish mood, gaining
1 1/2 at 212 1/2 p following news of the 40 per cent sales advance at BT's
Cellnet unit.
Shell Transport dropped 8 to 711p after revealing a slight fall in
third-quarter current cost net income, the figure that ignores the effect of
shifts in the underlying oil price. The profit of Pounds 853m was down from
Pounds 861m last time but well within a broad range of forecasts. SGST, a
keen supporter of the stock, argued: 'The two problem areas (Shell Oil and
Chemicals) . . . are improving their performance at a faster rate than can
be expected, and an earnings upturn in 1995 should underpin share price
outperformance.'
Dollar influenced pharmaceuticals stocks moved into positive territory with
the opening of Wall Street. US buying was still in evidence, with the heavy
dealing of the past couple of days revealed to have been carried out through
the Instinet system, Reuters' US-based equity brokerage service. Glaxo added
5 at 622p and Wellcome rose 9 to 673p.
Meanwhile, Fisons improved 4 to 125p with 4.8m shares traded as bid
speculation continued. Among the companies cited as possible bidders are
Zeneca, off a penny at 870p, Amersham International, still reeling from
disappointing figures on Wednesday and down 19 at 909p, and Medeva, a penny
up at 173p.
Shares in Northumbrian Water jumped 16 to 712p after the company posted
favourable interim figures which included a surprise 16 per cent dividend
increase, well above the 5 per cent guideline adopted by water companies in
recent years. Profits more than doubled to Pounds 46.1m. However, one
analyst said: 'Shareholders will welcome the increase in the dividend,
although it will raise the political pressure.'
Among food retailers, Iceland hardened a penny to 161p following a
recommendation from Panmure Gordon, and Morrison Supermarkets moved 5 1/2
ahead to 140p after Hoare Govett changed its recommendation on the stock
from 'underperform ' to 'buy'.
Anglo-Dutch group Unilever continued to be a nervous trade ahead of today's
third-quarter figures and the shares lost another 5 at 1129p.
Textiles group Coats Viyella rose 8 1/2 to 202 1/2 p after the company said
it was looking to sell its yarns and fabric arm and its carpet divisions,
and had received a number of approaches.
Drinks group Taunton Cider was particularly busy. Volume jumped to 7.7m, as
the equivalent of around 3.4 per cent of the company's shares changed hands,
with one dealer pointing to a tax related trade. The shares closed a penny
lower at 151p.
Reed International benefited from a presentation to analysts on its
professional publishing, particularly its electronic information side.
Several analysts, including the team from Hoare Govett, came away feeling
reassured and the shares closed 4 higher at 765p.
First day trading in TLG, the former Thorn Lighting, ended in a comfortable
premium with the shares standing at 124p, against a flotation price of 115p.
Computer software group Tadpole Technology dipped 8 to 432p.
Eurotunnel remained a lively market ahead of Monday's start to direct train
running between London and the Continent, rising 12 to 251p for a four-day
advance of 9 per cent. The driving force remained the Paris market, where
2.1m shares changed hands yesterday - against under 0.6m in London - to
become the most actively traded French stock.

FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burton jumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
High street retailer Burton Group was one of the day's most active stocks as
the market celebrated a robust set of annual figures from the company.
Turnover at the close stood at a hefty 21m and the shares climbed 7 1/2 to
71p. Burton reported profits of Pounds 41.1m, up from Pounds 16.3m, and
maintained the final dividend at 2p.
Brokers upgraded current year profits forecasts, and joint broker BZW was
said to have weighed in with a sharp increase of Pounds 15m to Pounds 70m.
However, BZW was unavailable for comment.
A rival broker said: 'There is a lot of comfort in these figures. For one
thing there are no nasty surprises. It seems as if things are beginning to
get back on track. We must now wait to see how the trends that have emerged
this year develop.' The favourable sentiment in Burton also boosted Next,
which added 5 at 247p.
