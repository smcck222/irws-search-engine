FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Royals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market took a churlish view of third-quarter profits from Royal
Insurance and the shares dropped almost 20p after the headline figure was
announced.
Subsequent reappraisal of underlying nuances in the results prompted furious
two-way trading which saw turnover of 15m shares. The volume was the highest
since February 1992 but then Royal had announced that its losses had plunged
to Pounds 373m and shareholders would receive no dividend.
The picture yesterday was altogether brighter. Nine-month profits came in at
Pounds 311m, against Pounds 113m a year ago, and although they were at the
lower end of forecasts some analysts had been over enthusiastic following
bumper second-quarter figures. The main hit of Pounds 19m came from the
rebalancing of Royals' investment portfolio - the group has spent the last
year shifting Pounds 400m from bonds to equities. But Mr Charles Landa of
SGST, remained positive on the stock, arguing that Royals was 'sacrificing
investment income today for capital growth tomorrow'.
Analysts also said the presentation was impressively upbeat. The shares,
which have performed very strongly over the past few weeks, rallied from
their low but closed 5 off at 295p.

FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a slower day, but levels of volume remained
encouraging and there was steady two-way business for most of the session,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading, the FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,107, down
8 points and standing at a premium to the cash market of 4 points. Fair
value was around 6.5.
Turnover came to 11,592 lots traded, down from 15,363 on Wednesday. There
was no great weight of selling, and for much of the morning the premium to
the cash market hovered around 20 points.
Traders were encouraged by what they saw as broad resilience after the
previous day's fireworks which ended with a 44-point gain on the back of a
strong early Wall Street.
Yesterday afternoon's proceedings were mostly left to the local, independent
traders, with the bigger trading houses retiring to the sidelines once Wall
Street showed signs of becoming more volatile.
In late, screen based trading, the December contract dipped below 3,100,
with contracts numbers rising to more than 13,500.
Traded options volume was 24,636 lots, down from 35,998 on Wednesday. FT-SE
and Euro FT-SE trading acounted for just under 13,000 contracts. Ladbroke,
at 2,000 lots, was the most active individual stock option.

FT  11 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie stages strong rally to regain
3,100 level - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An uninspiring and dispirited performance by London's equity market
throughout a sluggish and tired morning session was transformed by the
latest data from the US, which indicated a marked slowing down of
inflationary pressures affecting producer prices in the US.
Down almost 18 points within an hour of the opening, the FT-SE 100 commenced
a powerful and sustained rally shortly after the US news was announced,
easily regaining the 3,100 level and closing a net 6.3 higher at 3,105.9.
The news that producer prices had fallen by 0.5 per cent, against
expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase, took the markets completely by
surprise and prompted strong gains across internat-ional bond and equity
markets.
Wall Street, which gave an alarmingly erratic performance on Wednesday
evening, initially moving up 38 points on the Dow Jones Average and then
sliding to a 20-point net loss before rallying to close a shade higher, was
almost 20 points up shortly after it opened yesterday. The Dow was 11 points
ahead well after London closed.
The first back-to-back fall in producer prices for more than three years was
seen by markets as a potent signal that the US economy is slowing and was
thought to lessen the chances that US interest rates will rise more than 50
basis points next week.
On Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee meets to formulate US interest
rate policy and has long been expected to promote another rise in US
interest rates. Prior to yesterday's producer price data, economists and
strategists expected the Federal Reserve to lift US rates, currently at 4.75
per cent, by at least 50 basis points and possibly by a full percentage
point.
Earlier, London opened on a quiet note and almost totally lacking in
enthusiasm after Wall Street's surprising lack of follow-through on
Wednesday. There was no support for equities from the gilts market, which
edged down and showed little signs of rallying.
There was no comfort for the markets from Germany, where the Bundesbank
council met for its regular fortnightly meeting and signalled no change in
German interest rates. Although most analysts had forecast no change, there
were suggestions in the market that a small reduction had been possible.
London's second line stocks gave a resilient performance throughout the day,
with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index only marginally lower at worst and eventually
9.5 higher at 3,542.8.
Turnover in equities was 573m shares, with non-FT-SE 100 stocks acccounting
for around 57 per cent of the total. There was comfort for the City's
harassed dealing teams with news that the value of customer business in the
market on Wednesday was Pounds 1.6bn, the highest for a week.
It was another heavy day of company trading statements, with the UK's two
biggest companies, BT and Shell Transport, reporting. BT's results were
above the consensus of forecasts but there was a measure of disappointment
with the dividend increase, 6 per cent, against some over-optimisitc
forecasts of 8 per cent. Shell's figures were in line with estimates but the
shares slipped back in line with other oil stocks.
A big two-way pull developed in Royal Insurance, with profit-takers moving
in and outgunning bulls of the shares.
The market's two newcomers, TLG, formerly the lighting division of Thorn
EMI, and Tele-Cine, made reasonably successful debuts, both moving to modest
premiums over the issue prices.
Banks continued to outperform the market, especially Barclays and National
Westminster. Northumbrian Water was the star performer in the utilities
sectors after delivering a bumper 16 per cent increase in the interim
dividend.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Initial Dow rise reversed as
bonds turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US shares climbed early yesterday on the heels of rising bond prices, before
falling into negative territory later on profit-taking and a downturn in the
bond market, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 9.76 down at 3,821.99. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 lost 1.03 at 464.37, while the American SE composite shed 1.66 to
449.59 and the Nasdaq composite 2.87 to 764.38. NYSE volume came to 282m
shares.
The producer price index declined by 0.5 per cent in October, exactly
matching September's movement  - most analysts were expecting a 0.1 per cent
increase.
However, few economists wavered from their forecasts that the Federal
Reserve would tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates by at least
50 basis points at next Tuesday's open market committee meeting. Analysts
said the positive PPI figure decreased the likelihood that the Fed would
make the 100 basis-point increase some had been anticipating.
Markets see-sawed for the second consecutive day yesterday following
unsteady bond prices. Wednesday's session was volatile amid uncertainties
regarding the economic impact of Republican victories in congressional
elections.
Late in the morning session the Dow had gained nearly 25 points as the
30-year Treasury bond rose, but declined as the long bond lost  3/8 late in
the day and the dollar fell to its late Wednesday price against the Japanese
yen.
Sears Roebuck jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 after the retailer
announced its intention to spin off its 80 per cent stake in the insurance
subsidiary Allstate next year. Under this plan, Sears' shareholders would
receive approximately one share in Allstate for each Sears share presently
held. Allstate fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 1/8 on the news.
Shares in US computer-chip makers declined after an industry report, issued
late on Wednesday, indicated that sector growth for October was not as
strong as many analysts had predicted. Industry bellwether Intel, which is
traded on the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 61 1/8 , Texas
Instruments Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 77 and National Semiconductor Dollars
3/8 to Dollars 17 5/8 .
Telefonos de Mexico declined sharply on news that it will face tough
competition from a Dollars 1bn joint venture, announced Wednesday, between
telecommunications giant AT&amp;T and Mexico's Grupo Industrial Alfa. By the
close, Telmex ADRs were down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 51 1/4 . AT&amp;T and Alfa
plan to begin operations next year and apply for a licence to provide
long-distance service so that it will be ready to compete when that market
is opened for full competition in January 1997.
Greyhound Lines slipped Dollars  1/16 to Dollars 2 3/16 on news that the
beleaguered bus company had rejected a new reorganisation proposal from its
bondholders.
Caterpillar gained slightly in the morning after announcing on Wednesday
that it would increase prices of North American machines and engines, but
fell with the rest of the market to end Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 58.
Canada
Initial gains were washed away once again, as the weakening in the bond
markets sent share prices lower late in the session. The TSE 300 index
finished 12.19 down at 4,179.19 in volume of 51.3m shares.
Mexico
The bolsa registered its fourth biggest fall of 1994 as investors piled out
of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) after a number of brokers downgraded the
issue following AT&amp;T's announcement on Wednesday of a Dollars 1bn joint
venture with industrial group Alfa to compete with Telmex in long-distance
services.
The IPC index closed 126.62 or 4.83 per cent off at 2,492.32. It was dragged
down by heavily weighted Telmex, which saw its 'L' shares plummet 8.62 per
cent and its 'A' stock drop 8.38 per cent.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo gained a further 2.2 per cent in moderate trading as
sentiment was boosted by a successful share sale by Brazil's National
Development Bank (NDB).
The Bovespa index ended 1,076 higher at 49,926. Turnover was RDollars 258.5m
(Dollars 309.7m).
The NDB raised RDollars 91.1m with the sale of minority stakes in 13
companies, up 6.4 per cent from a minimum RDollars 85.6m combined asking
price for all stocks.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei affected by
losses in privatised issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Broadly based selling depressed equities as a decline in speculative stocks
and privatised issues prompted arbitrage-linked sales, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 159.03 lower at 19,264.85 after a day's high of
19,456.69 and low of 19,238.05. Arbitrage selling and stop-loss sales
absorbed index-linked buying by trust funds. Individual investors who had
bought stocks on margin at their highs in June started to liquidate their
positions before the six-month margin settlements in December.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.25 to 1,520.03 and the
Nikkei 300 sank 2.43 to 278.40. Losers led gainers by 737 to 224, with 201
issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.85 at
1,251.81.
Continued declines in privatised issues also worried investors. Traders said
sentiment was worse than indicated by the Nikkei's declines. While the
Nikkei 225 was still above the March 31 level of 19,111.92, the Topix index
had now stayed below the last fiscal year's close for four consecutive days.
Volume totalled 292m shares, against 296m. Foreign investors remained
inactive, while public funds, expected to support share prices below 19,000
on the Nikkei, were also absent.
Japan Tobacco lost Y27,000 or 2.7 per cent at Y967,000 and Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone slipped Y12,000 to Y851,000 on foreign selling.
Speculative shares bought on the pachinko, or pinball, theme plunged.
Nakabayashi, the office equipment maker, fell Y27 to Y893 and Sailor Pen
dropped Y100 to Y734.
Konami, a video game software company, plummeted Y400 or 17 per cent to
Y2,010 after it announced that it was expecting a net loss of Y14.5bn for
the current business year.
Brokers were lower, reflecting the current stagnation in the stock market.
Nomura Securities dipped Y70 to Y1,860 and Nikko Securities Y40 to Y1,040.
Some electricals were higher. Mitsubishi Electric rose Y5 to Y700 and
Toshiba Y3 to Y722.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 136.11 to 21,329.25 in volume of 17.8m
shares. Aoyama Trading, a discount suit retailer, retreated Y400 to Y2,500
after reporting a decline in profits for the six months to September.
Roundup
The Pacific Rim region remained generally nervous ahead of an expected
increase in US interest rates next week. Colombo was closed for trading due
to a curfew declared in Sri Lanka to avert post-poll violence after
Wednesday's presidential election.
SYDNEY declined on offshore selling of leading resources shares as profits
were taken following a strong rally in recent months. The All Ordinaries
index slipped 11.3 to 1,971.3, in turnover of ADollars 490m.
Economic data which showed the October unemployment level at a three-year
low lifted prices for a time, but selling pressure was renewed during the
afternoon.
In the mining sector, CRA weakened 16 cents to ADollars 18.20, WMC was down
24 cents at ADollars 6.88 and MIM receded 9 cents to ADollars 2.64.
HONG KONG drifted lower as most investors remained absent in anticipation of
a further rise in US interest rates next week.
The Hang Seng index shed 14.72 to 9,390.76 on turnover of HKDollars 1.7bn,
compared with HKDollars 2.08bn on Wednesday.
Some dealers noted futures-led arbitrage selling by institutions, helping to
dampen the price of Hong Kong Telecom, which fell 20 cents to HKDollars
15.65.
Brokers also commented that there was some buying interest by Japanese
investors and brokerages during the day.
SINGAPORE finished lower, with the Straits Times Industrial index off 14.46
at 2,329.94 in volume of 125.4m shares.
Jurong Shipyard fell 10 cents to SDollars 13.30 and Fraser and Neave 30
cents to SDollars 17, but Cycle and Carriage added 10 cents at SDollars
13.30.
MANILA succumbed to widespread selling, having seen substantial gains in
early trading, as the Philippine peso fluctuated wildly on the foreign
exchange market.
The composite index fell by 41.67 to 2,968.20, breaching the 3,000 level.
The peso hit a low of 24.80 against the dollar early on, before recovering
to 24.30.
BOMBAY fell sharply for a second consecutive day, the BSE 30-share index
weakening 64.59 to a provisional 4,141.09 after a 2.1 per cent drop on
Wednesday.
Reliance Industries closed Rs8.75 lower at Rs381.25 after being quoted
briefly at Rs360 in early trade. Large investors sold following the
company's announcement of plans to merge with two of its associates.
BANGKOK's banks and finance houses led the way down as the SET index dropped
24.01 or 1.6 per cent to 1,472.52 in moderate turnover of Bt6.2bn. Banks
receded 1.7 per cent, mostly early in the day, and the finance sector
retreated 2 per cent.
WELLINGTON drifted back to lose some of its early gains on news that the
popular Mr Jim Anderton had resigned as leader of the left-wing Alliance
party. The NZSE-40 index ended a net 13.71 up at 2,088.88, having been 25
points ahead in late morning trade.
KUALA LUMPUR saw turnover tumble from MDollars 550.6m to MDollars 205m as
the KLSE composite index relinquished 12.05 at 1,039.46. SEOUL's composite
index finished 11.52 down at 1,126.87 on broadly based profit-taking.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Academic approach to UBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have tracked the proxy battle over the future of Union Bank of
Switzerland mainly through the premium on the registered shares relative to
the bearers.
UBS directors are seeking shareholder approval to convert the registered
into bearers at an EGM on November 22. Therefore, the premium should
disappear if the directors carry the day.
Since September 29, when the plan was announced, the premium has dropped
from 34 per cent to around 13 per cent. But this week, it has moved back up
above 16 per cent.
On Tuesday, two Zurich academics, Mr Matthias Denzler and Mr Martin Janssen,
suggested looking at a more sophisticated measure. In an article in the Neue
Zurcher Zeitung, they pointed out that an investor can buy an EGM vote, so
to speak, by purchasing a share and at the same time entering a December
contract for its resale.
They traced the net cost of such a vote for a registered share over the past
month, finding that it has declined from a peak of SFr9 to around SFr3 per
share. Their conclusion: investors now recognise that UBS has enough proxies
to win.
They suggested, too, that the 6 per cent slide in the UBS market
capitalisation since September 29 reflected the fear that legal rows after
the EGM would hurt the bank's profits performance.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US data put bourses back on
upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After their enthusiastic reaction to the US election results, bourses pulled
back a little yesterday morning, as if they had decided to wait for next
Tuesday's FOMC meeting and the forecast rise in US interest rates, writes
Our Markets Staff.
However, the atmosphere changed with the fall of 0.5 per cent in the US
producer price index in October, following a similar drop in September. 'It
is the first back-to-back fall in PPI that we have had in three years,' said
Mr John Blackley at James Capel yesterday. Capel's economists were still
looking for a US rate increase next week, he added, but there was now a
feeling that maybe 50 basis points would be enough.
FRANKFURT's Dax index moved from a session's fall of 14.07 at 2,082.40,
through a post-bourse low of around 2,076 to an Ibis-indicated close of
2,098.04. Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM5.7bn.
The main impetus for the afternoon upsurge came from traders who had to
cover their short positions earlier in the week; some of them were taking a
positive attitude to the market by the end of the day.
Financials did well, Allianz and Deutsche Bank showing gains of DM28 to
DM2,408 and DM8.70 to DM759.20 at the end of Ibis trading. Cyclicals were
muted or worse, Linde, the engineer, falling DM20.50 to DM895.
Results news was good for Veba, where a 49 per cent jump in profits took the
energy based group up DM8.80 to DM522, but bad for Siemens, although it
recovered to close just 40 pfennigs down at DM625 after hours. Meanwhile,
German newspapers picked up a dated but derogatory story from the US on
Schering's BetaSeron prospects, and the pharmaceuticals group dropped
DM18.50 to DM960.50.
PARIS remained firm in spite of falling back slightly at the close. The
CAC-40 added 4.49 at 1,948.35 in turnover of some FFr4bn.
French financial markets will be closed today for the Armistice Day holiday.
Carrefour, the retailer, went against the trend, losing FFr127 or 5 per cent
at FFr2,171, as speculation mounted that a report damaging to the group was
to be published in one of the domestic newspapers during the session. In the
event no such article appeared and the company said that it planned to ask
the stock market authorities to investigate the fall in the share price.
Eurotunnel advanced 2 per cent to FFr20.95 in very high volume as local
investors took up positions ahead of the official opening of the Channel
tunnel to fare paying rail passengers on Monday.
ZURICH talked about switches as the SMI index closed 12.3 higher at 2,602.7.
Swiss Re registered rose SFr26 to SFr783 ahead of an analysts' meeting with
the company and Zurich Insurance balanced this, to an extent, with a fall of
SFr6 to SFr1,235.
Similarly, pharmaceuticals dealers said that investors were moving into Ciba
and Sandoz, up SFr15 to SFr764 and SFr6 to SFr667 respectively, and out of
Roche certificates, which fell SFr55 to SFr5,890.
AMSTERDAM retreated as overall activity was affected by weakness in Royal
Dutch after the oil group reported its third-quarter results. The AEX index
dipped 0.80 to 410.74.
Royal Dutch left analysts with contrasting views. There were some who
considered that operating income was below expectations, while others, such
as James Capel, believed that they were 'pretty solid'. Nevertheless, the
view of the Dutch investor was to sell on the day, and the shares lost Fl
2.30 at Fl 189.00.
Lehman Brothers commented earlier this week that it was maintaining its
overweight position in Dutch equities on the basis that the quality of
earnings and dividend growth made the market attractive relative to markets
such as Germany, Belgium or Italy.
The one major worry clouding the horizon, said Lehman, remained the market's
historic exposure to the US. 'Of the main nine European equity markets, the
Dutch would be the most vulnerable to the expected correction in US equity
prices.'
MILAN was supported by domestic strength in bonds as well as external
factors which helped the Comit index to a gain of 5.28 at 636.17.
Cir saw one of the best performances, rising L77 to L1,932, with rumours
continuing that the group might soon dispose of one of its assets.
In the insurance sector, Fondiaria impressed with a gain of L420 to L11,720
amid various reports that the company might launch an offer for the 10 per
cent of its subsidiary Fondiaria Assicurazioni that it did not already own.
Credito Romagnolo added L290 at L16,900 on speculation that Cariplo, the
savings bank, might launch a counter-offer to the bid announced by Credito
Italiano, up L33 at L1,659. Ambroveneto, which is also subject to a takeover
bid from BCI, fell L65 to L4,385, while the predator gained L50 at L3,635.
MADRID came back from a day's holiday and reflected two days of gains: the
general index, covering the two-day period, rose 5.49 or 1.9 per cent to
299.34; the Ibex, real-time index, traded in Barcelona and Valencia on
Wednesday, showed a one-day rise of 25.12 or 0.8 per cent at 3,232.29.
Turnover was Pta36.4bn. Banks, weak in the morning, were no better than
mixed at the end of the day, and ADR stocks were only a little better than
that on average. The most sizeable gains came from the construction sector,
which has tended to exaggerate sentiment: Cubiertas moved ahead Pta450 to

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa in modest loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Johannesburg lost momentum as a modest gain in golds was offset
by profit-taking among industrials.
The industrials index slipped 5 to 6,774, while steadier bullion prices
helped the gold shares index to a 7-point rise at 2,170. The overall index
eased 1 to 5,848.
South African Breweries was a feature among industrial shares, retreating
R2.25 to R99.50 in spite of reporting a 20 per cent increase in profits for
the half year to the end of September.
Tiger Oats, the agriculture and foods group, shed 50 cents to R46.50 after
reporting a 3 per cent advance in earnings per share in the year to
end-September.
Nedcor, the banking group, rose to a new 1994 high of R37.75, up R1.75,
after reporting a 23 per cent expansion in earnings. De Beers put on 50
cents at R99.50 and Anglos lost 75 cents at R243.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar firmer after surprise US inflation
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar made further gains yesterday as good inflation figures helped the
currency build on improved sentiment, following Republican gains in mid-term
congressional elections, writes Philip Gawith.
The October producer price index fell by 0.5 per cent, against a market
expectation of a 0.1 per cent increase. It was the first time in more than
three years that producer inflation had fallen for two consecutive months.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.5348, a gain of a pfennig from before the
PPI figures, and at Y98.04 from Y97.79 at Wednesday's close.
The firmer tone in the US currency came as an increasing number of analysts
suggested that the US currency may have turned, after a nine month fall.
Two dollar bloc currencies that profited from the firmer dollar, and
favourable market perceptions of domestic monetary policy, were the
Australian and New Zealand dollars.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank council left official interest rates, and the repo
rate, unchanged.
Sterling continued to weaken against the firmer dollar, closing at Dollars
1.5968 from Dollars 1.6036. Against the D-Mark, it finished at DM2.4506 from
DM2.4534.
With US markets closed today, traders are not expecting any sharp moves in
the dollar ahead of the important Federal Open Markets Committee meeting on
Tuesday.
There is increasing optimism, however, that a decisive increase in interest
rates at the meeting could confirm an upward trend for the dollar. Mr Tim
Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'Sentiment has
definitely turned over the past week. The Fed has an opportunity to put one
more piece of the puzzle in place.'
'I don't think positions have yet changed to match the change in sentiment,
but the dollar is certainly vulnerable to good news,' said Mr Stewart. He
said he would be much more confident if he believed the Fed would lift
interest rates by more than 50 basis points. 'If it raises by only 50 basis
points, the dollar will still be vulnerable to strong data.'
Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank in London, said:
'The election result impacted on a market that had already gone too far. We
think the dollar has bottomed. It will take something fundamental for this
market to reverse its direction and go to the downside again.'
He said the dollar should reach DM1.57-1.60 on a three month view. Chemical
Bank is expecting the Fed to raise interest rates by 150 basis points by the
end of the first quarter of 1995.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, also said the first
signs of a change in the dollar's trend had emerged. 'The whole sentiment
seems to have changed from selling on rallies to buying on dips.'
Mr Parsons said a graph showing the difference between the Dollars /D-Mark
rate, and Dollars /Pounds (cable), was a good proxy for dollar sentiment.
From a high of nearly thirty units, in late January, this gap had shrunk to
minus fourteen units on October 25. Since then the trend has reversed,
breaking through the trend line. He ventured that if the Fed were to
intervene again now, supporting rather than opposing the market, 'it could
firmly and conclusively establish that the dollar has turned.'
UK cash interest rates softened markedly following the large net injection
of funds into the money market at the two-weekly gilt repo on Wednesday. One
week money was offered at 5 1/8 per cent, from just under 5 3/4 per cent
before the repo. One month money was offered at 5 per cent, also down from 5
3/4 per cent before the repo.
Overnight money was also easy, as the Bank of England cleared a small Pounds
250m shortage at established rates. It traded between 4 and 5 1/4 per cent.
In recent weeks, daily shortages have often been above Pounds 1bn, with a
high portion of liquidity provided in the form of late assistance.
Mr Parsons said that up to one month out, lending rates were below the
current base rate of 5 3/4 per cent.
In Europe, the Swedish krona appreciated to SKr4.769 against the D-Mark,
from SKr4.81, buoyed by optimism about a yes vote in Sunday's referendum on
joining the EU.
The Italian lira was also firmer, at L1,024 against the D-Mark, from L1,027.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (8): Horn and the luck of the Hungarians -
Though Gyula Horn is a talented operator, to many he now seems out-of-date /
Prime minister interviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can be few better measures of the change in eastern Europe than the
evolving image of Gyula Horn. As foreign minister in the last Communist
government five years ago, he was one of the liberators of the Communist
bloc: the man who with a gesture of biblical proportions opened the iron
curtain and let the east Germans go free.
Now, after four years in opposition, Mr Horn is back in government, this
time as Hungary's Socialist prime minister. 'There should be no reservations
about the government or me personally,' says Mr Horn. 'We started the
transition to democracy in the second half of the 1980s of our own free
will, without any pressure. We began creating a multi-party system and the
market economy. Now we want to carry this through to the very end.'
But eastern Europe has moved on even faster than Mr Horn. A progressive in
the 1980s, the 62-year-old Mr Horn still reminds many of the past. 'He
doesn't fit into the new European political landscape,' says Mr Janos
Martonyi, former state secretary at the foreign ministry.
Anti-communists damn the prime minister for his participation in the 'padded
jacket' worker's militia that put down Hungary's 1956 uprising against
Soviet rule. Even the 1994 version of Mr Horn provokes a shudder or two, at
least among Hungary's influential intelligentsia. It may be unfair to judge
by demeanour. But according to one prominent banker: 'Wherever Horn appears,
everyone thinks of a former communist. No matter what he says.'
Hunched in his chair, chain-smoking, rarely meeting the eye, a short man in
a prime ministerial office the size of a basketball court, Mr Horn fits the
stereotype of the Communist apparatchik.
When Mr Horn departs from his script, he has a good line in deadpan humour
illustrated by a wry grin. But he can as easily lose his patience with
questioning and abruptly terminate an interview.
Content is as much at issue as style. Mr Horn, born of a working-class
Communist family, is still proud to call himself a leftwinger. But nowadays,
he looks not to Marx as the fount of his socialism but to Pope John Paul II.
'The head of the Catholic church and the Vatican say capital is blind and
deaf to social differences - that is why policymakers have to interfere.'
The Socialist leader's left-leaning beliefs reflect the opinions of his
constituency. Hungary had a communist government for four decades and
egalitarian ideals remain strong. Many voters opted for the Socialists
because they promised security and support for the losers in the transition.
These, not Budapest's chattering intellectuals nor judgemental westerners,
are the people Mr Horn cares about. 'My model is Janos Kovacs, the ordinary
simple person on the street who can tolerate the zigzags that politicians
make and tell what is genuine and what false.'
Aides say he really means that. Uncomfortable in parliament and before
western investors, Mr Horn nevertheless shows a real rapport with crowds
that is rare among east European politicians. 'These are my waters,' he
says. 'I can really feel good among people.' This popular touch makes Mr
Horn in a sense a better democrat than his conservative predecessors who
supported the idea that the people should rule in theory but were always
disappointed in the character of the Hungarian masses.
Mr Horn is a talented operator behind closed doors as well as on the public
stage. He doggedly held his party together when it seemed doomed to
extinction. Now he plays the arbiter between technocrats, trade unionists
and the myriad groups within the broad and heterogeneous governing party.
As foreign minister, Mr Horn visited the US. A former aide tells how a US
state department official offered an insulting 15-minute audience. Mr Horn
accepted, said his piece, smiled, got up and politely left the open-mouthed
US official after 10 minutes.
The genius of Mr Horn's tactics can be overdone. The prime minister has a
tendency to make up policy on the hoof. 'I think Horn is a disaster,' says
Mr Tamas Bacskai, chairman of Unicbank. 'Improvisation is wonderful if it is
done by Moliere, but he is not a good improviser.'
Nevertheless most people, whatever their criticisms, share the view of Mr
Janos Bartha, managing director of CS First Boston in Budapest. 'I think
that Horn is an absolutely professional politician,' he says.
The question is whether the Socialist premier can be not just a consummate
politician but a leader too: one who can understand Hungary's economic
plight and convince the people to accept unpopular measures.
Mr Laszlo Urban, economics spokesman of the opposition Young Democrats, has
his doubts: 'He lets conflicts emerge, evaluates whose position is what and
then tries to please everybody.' Even the government spokesperson concedes
that Mr Horn likes to be liked.
That makes the prime minister somewhat unpredictable, a bit of a weather
vane, but not necessarily a man without principle.
Mr Horn's socialism is of the born-and-bred variety. But he has another
vision which sits uneasily with his ideological conviction. 'Perhaps it
might sound like a kind of slogan,' he says, 'but I want a Hungary which
does not differ from the developed countries.'
But that line has become a cliche in eastern Europe and does not impress
many Hungarian opinion leaders. 'I don't think he has a vision beyond
Saturday, no, make that Friday,' says Mr Laszlo Csaba of the Kopint-Datorg
economic research institute.
Visionary leadership, however, may count for more in the confused countries
of the former Communist bloc than in the settled west. Mr Vaclav Klaus
appears to have made a real difference for the better in the Czech Republic.
In Mr Bacskai's view, Hungary also had an 'outstanding statesman' in Janos
Kadar, general secretary of the Communist party between 1956 and 1988. 'In
50 years a country is lucky to have one such man,' the banker says. Hungary,
he suggests, has run out of its allocation.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (7): A four-year revolution - The
privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary's Socialist-led government has set itself the ambitious target of
completing its privatisation programme by the end of its four-year term. To
show it is in earnest, it has appointed a political heavyweight, Mr Ferenc
Bartha, a former central bank governor and more recently head of Banque
Indosuez Hungary, to the new job of government privatisation commissioner.
'We don't expect to privatise 100 per cent of the economy by 1998,' concedes
Mr Peter Mihalyi, Mr Bartha's deputy. 'But we would like the economy to be
largely in private hands. We have to reduce the state's involvement so that
privatisation is no longer a top priority political issue.'
To achieve this goal, a group of 30 economists from the state and private
sectors spent several weeks this autumn drawing up a new privatisation
strategy and draft bill. Mr Bartha is hopeful the bill will be passed by
parliament before the year ends. 'The political will exists,' he says.
He says the state will reduce the number of companies in which it will
retain a majority stake and privatise companies immediately rather than
restructure them first. Cash would be generated from sales of the big blue
chip companies such as utilities, while companies would be teamed up with
strategic investors. Finding good partners and providing for companies'
long-term survival will take priority over revenue generation for
medium-sized firms.
The state intends to sell small companies as quickly as possible, preferably
for cash, or failing that by offering incentives to management and/or
employee groups or other investors.
Mr Bartha wants to make greater use of the country's nascent capital
markets. One idea is to launch a country fund grouping shares from 10 to 12
partially privatised companies such as Matav, the telecommunications
monopoly, 30 per cent of which was sold to a Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech
consortium in December.
Most foreign advisers believe good companies would generate more revenue if
sold individually, but Mr Bartha says a country fund would attract interest
from the many new emerging market investment funds.
The appointment of Mr Bartha and the new strategy have been generally
well-received by foreign investors. However, most are reserving judgment
until they see action. 'There's an element of strategy fatigue. We've heard
much of this before,' says one western investment banker.
Investors add that, in the short term, some of the government's proposals,
such as the merger of the two main privatisation bodies - AV Rt, the state
holding company, and the AVU, the state property agency - will inevitably
slow down, not accelerate, the process.
Investors have also been unsettled by sweeping per- sonnel changes at AV Rt,
inc- luding the dismissal of Mr Lajos Csepi, its respected general director,
and the sacking of several top mana- gers at large state companies due for
privatisation such as MVM, the electricity mono- poly. 'However competent
the new managers, such radical changes will inevitably slow privatisation of
these companies,' one banker says.
Observers fear the sackings and a much-publicised inquiry into alleged
corruption in privatisation under the previous government mean the process
will remain highly politicised.
A western diplomat says: 'The government is spending a lot of energy
investigating the past and attacking its predecessor's record. Instead, it
should be concentrating on the future.'
Despite their criticisms, most investors are hopeful the government will
move ahead with the privatisation of its gas distribution and electricity
monopolies, both of which are attracting significant foreign interest.
Gas will come first with the government expected to announce a tender date
this autumn for the sale of 25 per cent stakes in the five regional domestic
gas distributors. Mr Laszlo Pal, Socialist industry and trade minister, says
the government will follow this up in the first quarter of 1995 with the
first tender for the privatisation of MVM, the electricity monopoly. The aim
is to close a deal by the end of the year. The government, which is being
advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK merchant bank, is expected to offer
stakes first in MVM's power distribution subsidiaries.
Before this can happen, however, the government must complete the regulatory
framework for the industry. This includes tightening the contractual
relationship between different MVM subsidiaries and resolving the socially
sensitive issue of price regulation.
Mr Pal says prices, which are controlled by the state, will become
'market-based'. But to achieve this, the government has to ensure that
increases are acceptable to the public and do not 'gallop away'. Analysts
estimate that electricity prices must rise by at least 70 per cent to make
the company attractive to outside investors.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (9): Colossus from Boston - The top
investment bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston, still recovering from wrenching internal reorganisation,
may stand in the shadow of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in New York and
London. But in Budapest and other east European financial centres, CSFB is a
colossus.
No other international investment bank has been so active. Even rivals
concede that CSFB is the pre-eminent investment bank in Budapest.
Yet Mr Janos Bartha, managing director of CSFB Budapest, says: 'It's not a
one-man show, far from that.' Creditanstalt Securities, a subsidiary of the
Austrian bank, competes on smaller deals. CSFB backed the wrong horse in the
bidding for Matav, the telecoms company, so Goldman Sachs won the success
fee in Hungary's biggest single privatisation.
Merrill Lynch, which handled tobacco industry privatisation, and NM
Rothschild, which has advised on telecoms and gas privatisation, also won
lucrative mandates without setting up costly local offices.
So although investment banking in Budapest may not be a one-man show, one
player - CSFB - has got most of the parts. CSFB helped the Hungarian
authorities privatise national airline Malev, refrigerator maker Lehel, the
commercial banks and now Hungarhotels, the hotel chain.
Until 1992 the firm estimated that it had advised on a third to a half of
M&amp;A activity. Now CSFB does not bother counting. 'Here we just don't have
the top-notch investment bank competitors with us in domestic markets,' says
Mr Bartha.
Aside from advisory work, CSFB has introduced corporate bonds and commercial
paper issues to the Budapest market, helping borrowers bypass the large
margins charged by Hungary's commercial banks. The fees have been modest but
the service has given CSFB access to such companies as McDonald's
Corporation with which it never had a relationship.
M&amp;A work and fixed income issues have helped meet running costs. But the
real rewards have come on the equity transactions that have proliferated in
the last 12 months. CSFB has acted as the prime conduit for the flow of
western institutional money into eastern Europe.
In Hungary's case, CSFB has managed the international equity issues of Egis,
Pannonplast and Fotex, and sold over Dollars 200m worth of shares. CSFB,
alone of the international investment banks, possesses a broker's licence in
Budapest. The firm has bought up shares on the secondary market, helped
western funds secure shareholdings in companies such as telecommunications
utility Matav - and profited handsomely.
Not all the deals have been well-judged, say rivals. 'I have a lot of
investors complaining about CSFB, both in terms of the assets they have been
sold and the fees they have been charged,' says one Budapest investment
banker. Fotex shares have slumped below their issue price despite CSFB's
stamp of approval. 'If I had bought Fotex I would be screaming,' the critic
says.
While New York and London may have suffered from the downturn in world bond
markets, Budapest is set for a record year. It is believed that CSFB's
Budapest office passed its targets for the year several months ago.
'Eastern Europe is going to be paying the salaries of investment bankers in
New York this year,' says a CSFB executive. Those who had distanced
themselves from CSFB's east European adventure now fight for their share of
the credit for revenues from Budapest, Prague and Moscow.
JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers are looking to set up Budapest offices. Mr
Hans-Jorg Rudloff, CSFB's former European head, who is now independent, may
build up his own investment banking business. Mr Bartha accepts that CSFB
will give up market share, if not market leadership.
Nevertheless, in its 15 professionals in the Budapest office, CSFB has a
lock on much of Hungary's investment banking expertise. Salomon Brothers has
been looking for months for someone to head its operation - without success.
'The barriers to entry are high,' says Mr Peter Kadas of CSFB.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (6): Welfare cuts needed - 'Resources must
be released for growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economists believe Hungary faces a stark choice: the country must cut public
expenditure, lower taxes and restructure its bloated welfare system, which
last year cost the equivalent of 29 per cent of gross domestic product, or
sacrifice strong economic growth and the chance to compete in the single
European market, writes Virginia Marsh.
Mr Andrew Rogerson, resident representative of the World Bank in Budapest,
says: 'Radical changes in spending are needed if Hungary is to close the gap
with western Europe. To catch up will require faster growth than is now on
the table. The government has to find a way to provide both a social safety
net and the basis for sustainable growth. It must release more resources for
growth and investment.'
However, it will not be easy for a Socialist-led government, elected in part
to soften the pain of transition, to overhaul the extensive welfare system
which most Hungarians have come to expect from the state and which provides
cash benefits to most households.
Mr Peter Akos Bod, the central bank governor, says that unlike the
productive sectors of the economy, the social sector has undergone little
restructuring in the past four years.
'Large areas - welfare, health, culture, education, social services -
function as they did 10 years ago . . . The previous government was
unwilling to tackle these problems because the economy was contracting and
society was in trauma due to the changes after 1990. Now, we should correct
this,' he says.
Within the government there appears to be a broad consensus on the need to
restructure the system which Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance minister, describes
as 'premature' for a country with Hungary's resources. However, he admits
implementation of tough measures will be difficult for many ministries. This
view is shared by western advisers who say there are already sharp divisions
within the government as to how deep cuts in welfare should be.
Mr Bekesi says social sector reform will form a large part of the
government's three-year modernisation plan due to be presented in the
spring. In the meantime, the cabinet has accepted a draft 1995 budget which
raises social expenditure by just 10 per cent in nominal terms. Given
expected annual inflation of more than 18 per cent, this will lead to
significant cuts in real terms, if implemented.
The draft budget also begins the first of several expected tax reforms in
the sector. From 1995, contributions to the social security and unemployment
funds will be only 25 per cent deductible for personal income tax purposes,
down from the present 100 per cent.
Welfare ministry officials say the efficiency of the system also needs to be
improved. A key problem is that too many benefits are paid to too many
people while an increasing number of Hungarians slip below the poverty line.
'Support should be better targeted at those who need it than at present,'
says Mr Mihaly Kokeny, secretary of state. For example, from 1996, the state
plans to combine child and child care benefit and pay families a flat rate.
Under the present scheme the benefit varies according to a family's income,
paying a higher amount to higher earners. 'This way we will create savings
for the system and redirect resources to lower income groups.'
He says welfare providers can also be made more efficient by increasing
competition among them and by allowing local authorities to contract out
some services to the private sector. Competitive tendering has already been
introduced in some World Bank-funded projects.
Other medium-term plans include pension reform. One way to reduce the burden
on the state would be to encourage private schemes and later retirement in
line with European norms. The present official retirement age is just 55 for
women and 60 for men.
Mr Kokeny says: 'We would like to restructure pensions so that people would
be able to retire early but there would be incentives to stay at work
longer.' He says an element of choice is essential if the population is to
accept cuts and changes in welfare: 'We cannot be rigid. We have to discuss
our plans openly and warn people of them well in advance. If we take a
top-down approach, we could easily fail.'
Western advisers point to the considerable political risks involved for the
Socialist government. One says: 'In making the cuts, the government is in
danger of losing the support of a large part of the middle class - those who
are not poor but not rich, either. The problem is many people are happy with
the status quo. The changes will benefit just a few.'

Like voters in other former east bloc countries, Hungarians returned former
Communists to power in this summer's general elections, the second since the
collapse of communism. Unlike many of their neighbours, however, Hungarians
again elected a potentially strong and stable government.
With 72 per cent of seats in parliament, the Socialist-Liberal coalition has
a large enough majority to pass any legislation, including amendments to the
constitution. The Socialists' control of 54 per cent of parliament means the
party is likely to serve a full four-year term.
The government, a coalition between the Hungarian Socialist party, the heir
to the Communist party, and the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, the
election runners-up, has pledged to use its mandate to complete Hungary's
transition to a market economy. Its key objectives are to finish the process
of privatisation, stabilise the country's heavily indebted economy and lay
the basis for strong growth and integration into the European Union.
Such ambitious aims, and the radical reforms which are required to achieve
them, represent a big challenge for the HSP, a left-wing party elected, in
part, to soften the pain of a transition which has already cost 1.4m jobs
and caused living standards to plunge for many Hungarians.
HSP leaders, however, recognise that the country's poor economic situation
means there is little room for manoeuvre. Mr Gyula Horn, the prime minister,
says: 'The basic fact is you cannot spend more money than you earn which is
what our governments have been doing for decades . . . It is our bad luck
that we are the ones who will have to stop that practice . . . Fundamental
changes have to be made.'
The challenge is to find a balance between the tough reforms needed to cure
the economy and his party's desire to create 'a social market economy' which
offers protection to the poorest members of society, Mr Horn says.
Analysts say finding this balance and formulating coherent, consistent
policies will be difficult for a coalition grouping socialists with free
market liberals and for an HSP whose members span the political spectrum.
The government's three months in office have already seen confrontations
between different factions in the party. Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the finance
minister, who is considered more of a liberal than a socialist, was forced
to water down his austere mid-year budget and accept a retro-active 8 per
cent increase in pensions after objections from trade unions backed by
cabinet members.
The soft economic policy line can be partly explained by the government's
unwillingness to take unpopular measures ahead of next month's nationwide
local elections which will be its first major test since May's general
elections.
Opinion polls indicate little chance of a defeat for the Socialists.
However, the Socialists and the Free Democrats will face a combined
challenge from the main opposition parties. The Hungarian Democratic Forum,
whose conservative-nationalist government suffered a crushing defeat in the
general elections, its ally the Christian Democrats and the liberal Young
Democrats (Fidesz) have, for the first time, agreed to field common
candidates in some districts.
Mr Viktor Orban, president of Fidesz, says it is essential the opposition
works together to defeat the government parties in 1998. 'The real challenge
is to prevent fragmentation of the opposition. By 1998 the government will
be unpopular and people will want to get rid of it. They won't be able to if
there is no credible alternative. We have to build up this alternative,' he
says.
Analysts say co-operation in the local elections could be the start of a
realignment in the centre and centre-right parties to counter-balance the
socialist-liberal alliance. This could lead Hungary towards a bipolar
political structure rather than the present tripolar structure of
socialists, liberals and conservatives. Mr Istvan Stumpf, director of the
Budapest School of Politics, says: 'The elections are important for the
future. The three opposition parties will see if they can gain more support
standing together. If they get only 10 per cent of the vote, then moves to
form a new centre-right coalition will collapse.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (5): In politics, time proves a great
healer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON

<TEXT>
Politics can make for few bedfellows stranger than the Socialists and Free
Democrats, partners in the new centre-left coalition government. One would
not guess from their present intimacy that they were formerly implacable
opponents. The Socialists were once the communist satraps of the Soviet
Union and their most vocal critics were precisely the dissident
intellectuals who went on to found the Free Democrats, writes Nicholas
Denton.
This being Hungary, the truth is more subtle. The founders of the Free
Democrats often came from communist family backgrounds and passed through
Maoism to their final, liberal political destination.
Meanwhile, Hungary's Communist rulers, chastened by the 1956 uprising,
treated dissidents quite gently. 'With few exceptions, these oppressed
people were not physically hurt,' says Mr Viktor Polgar, head of the
Socialists' Budapest campaign. 'They had BMWs while I was driving around in
a Toyota.'
But Free Democrats still remember how, even in the late 1980s, police
directed by the Communists beat up demonstrators on sensitive anniversaries.
Wiretap reports of the Free Democrats' kitchen-table conversations were sent
to ministers in the Communist government.
The dissidents have no monopoly on hard feelings. Some reform Communists
feel that they did the tough work of the transition while the opposition
basked in the admiration of the west. 'The Socialists are people who fought
for change, in a different way: they had to work within the system,' says Mr
Polgar. 'I would have loved to have been in opposition.'
Time has proved a great healer. Mr Ivan Vitanyi, a Socialist ideologist, now
argues for an eventual merger of the coalition parties. One forgiving
intellectual close to the Free Democrats has pushed for a liberal gesture to
rehabilitate the former communist regime and give it credit for its
relatively benign character.
Political imperatives have dictated the rapprochement. The Socialists,
despite their 54 per cent parliamentary majority, are still former
communists. They are distrusted and even hated. The Free Democrats bolster
their legitimacy.
As for the liberals, Hungarian politics appears increasingly bipolar. Apart
from an alliance with former communists the Free Democrats had unappealing
options: going in with conservatives they detest or inhabiting and
eventually dying in a no-man's-land between the political blocs.
Mr Miklos Haraszti was one of Hungary's most hounded dissidents. He backs
the coalition, but it is not easy. 'I support it and I hate it. We know we
have to do it but we don't have to be happy about it. It is the least awful
alternative,' he says. 'But that is democracy, isn't it?'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (4): Main goal is to join the EU - Foreign
policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overriding foreign policy objective of Hungary's new Socialist-led
government differs little from its conservative predecessor: to integrate
the country into western European structures through membership of the
European Union and Nato by the end of the century.
Mr Gyula Horn, the prime minister, says EU membership is the main goal of
his government. 'This is a duty, a task of the utmost importance for us . .
. Becoming a member means we will have been able to establish a social
market economy and to comply with European Union standards and regulations.
The other crucial factor is the security we think we can find in the EU.'
The government is building on the work of its predecessor which, together
with Poland and Czechoslovakia, signed an association agreement with the EU
in December 1991 and formally applied for membership earlier this year.
Hungary, in common with other eastern European states, believes it is now up
to the EU to reveal its timetable and conditions for membership. Mr Istvan
Szent-Ivanyi, state-secretary at the foreign ministry, says: 'The European
Union does not have a clear policy towards central Europe. We hope this can
be resolved at the Essen summit in December. Now, we hear different points
of view, from party to party and country to country. This makes preparatory
work very difficult for us.'
The government acknowledges that Hungary and other countries in the region
must reform their economies before joining the EU. But Mr Szent-Ivanyi says
the EU should apply the same political rationale to eastern European
enlargement as it did to members who joined in the 1980s and set its
economic conditions accordingly.
He says: 'The economic requirements for our membership should be formulated
so that the most advanced central European countries have a chance to comply
with them . . . Portugal, Greece and Spain were admitted due to a strong
political will to give a hand to the new-born democracies in those countries
and to help consolidate them. This was a courageous and clever step.'
Where the new government differs from its conservative-nationalist
predecessor is in its policy towards neighbouring countries, in particular
Romania and Slovakia. In his first speech to parliament as prime minister,
Mr Horn said Hungary's most urgent foreign policy task was to eliminate
tensions with its neighbours and negotiate basic friendship treaties with
the two countries. Improving relations was the best way to promote the
interests of the 2.3m ethnic Hungarians living in Romania and Slovakia, he
said.
In a departure from previous policy, Mr Horn said his government would
guarantee the inviolability of borders in the basic treaties - a guarantee
upon which both Romania and Slovakia have conditioned bilateral agreements.
Despite Hungary's overtures, the chances of a rapid agreement have been
lessened by political events in Romania and Slovakia since the new
government took office. In August, a nationalist anti-Hungarian party
formally joined Romania's ruling coalition for the first time. In September,
nationalists led by Mr Vladimir Meciar won Slovakia's general elections and
are expected to form the next government.
Foreign ministry officials concede these events mean it is less likely that
Bucharest and Bratislava will agree to Hungary's demands for improved
treatment of ethnic minorities. But faced with stalemate at the political
level, Hungary aims to improve economic and trade links with the two
countries. Officials say the effect may spill over in other fields such as
minority and human rights.
In the meantime, Hungary will continue to press the Council of Europe and
the European Union to provide greater legal guarantees to protect minority
and human rights. Mr Szent-Ivanyi says: 'This is not just a Hungarian
problem. We believe it is a hard-core issue for all central Europe, from the
former Yugoslavia to the Baltic states.'
Countries in the region need western European support to help build
confidence and overcome the 'tremendous suspicion' which exists between many
of them, he says. One way to achieve this might be to link applicant states'
minority and human rights record to EU membership.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (1): The hare becomes a tortoise - The
most westernised country in the region has squandered its head-start in the
past few years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON and VIRGINIA MARSH

<TEXT>
Hungary, the pioneer of eastern Europe's economic reforms, remains in many
ways the most advanced of the post-communist democracies. But this central
European state of 10m people with an impenetrable language appears to have
stumbled and squandered much of its head-start over the past couple of
years.
The national mood has slipped back into a customary malaise after a brief
burst of optimism when voters ejected an unpopular conservative government
in May and elected what appeared to be a more competent Socialist-led
administration.
Mr Gyorgy Ivanyi, commissioner for bank privatisation at Hungary's AVRT
state holding company, feels along with many commentators that Hungary has
lost its 'competitive edge.' He says: 'We are not Poland, forced to make
radical moves. Nor a Czech Republic, which can quietly wait for an upturn in
the world economy before doing anything serious. That is why we have neither
the dynamism of the Polish economy nor the consolidation of the Czech one.'
This loss of self-esteem matters. Hungarian business and government leaders,
lacking confidence in themselves, find it difficult to woo international
investors. 'The Czechs have sold their country fantastically, but the
Hungarians have not done so in any meaningful way,' admits Mr Janos Bartha,
managing director of CS First Boston in Budapest.
Some observers are not surprised that Hungary should slip down the rankings.
'It is logical that as others catch up, Hungary falls into its place,' says
Mr Andras Simor, managing director of Creditanstalt Securities in Budapest.
But the economic numbers are worse than that. Output has dropped 20 per cent
in four years; it has also fallen more or risen less than the east European
average every year since 1991. Recovery this year has run straight into
balance of payments constraints. The economy may show GDP growth of up to 3
per cent this year but is forecast to sink back into a second dip of
recession in 1995 as government austerity measures bite. Inflation, at 19.5
per cent in August, and the public sector deficit, expected to reach 7 per
cent of GDP, are intractable. Hungarian debt is stuck stubbornly below
investment grade while the rating agencies have twice upgraded the Czech
Republic.
Hidden by the gloomy national statistics, however, are a host of real
achievements. Though a deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary and
former official of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Gyorgy Szapary
argues: 'You cannot reduce a country to a fiscal deficit or a balance of
payments number.'
The national telecommunications company Matav is the first in the region to
be privatised. Gas and electricity sectors are next in line. A start has
been made to bring in foreign investment and expertise into the country's
troubled banking sector.
Activity on the Budapest stock exchange has taken off. Richter Gedeon, a
pharmaceuticals manufacturer, and plastics producer Pannonplast are among
companies that have been floated. A record Dollars 400m of portfolio
investment has flowed into the country in the past 12 months.
A new generation of entrepreneurs has sprung up. Businessmen like Mr Imre
Somody, the founder of pharmaceuticals producer Pharmavit, have taken the
place of the wheeler-dealers who made their fortunes in the 1980s, only to
lose them in the 1990s.
State-of-the-art digital lines have spread apace. New 'GSM' mobile telephone
services are a success. Construction has begun on the region's first
privately-financed toll motorway, which promises to bring Vienna within two
hours' easy driving of Budapest.
Complaints about banking services and office space, once staples of
businessmen's conversation, are now muted. Hungary's many Cassandras have
forgotten the inter-enterprise debt that they once said would entangle the
economy.
Hungary has its precocity to thank for many of its advantages. The country
opened up just in time, and lured foreign investors before the international
recession hit and western multinationals retrenched. The lax communist
regime allowed a relatively free flow of people and information. 'Hungary is
the most westernised country in the region,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi,
managing director of Central European International Bank. Just look at the
people, their outlook, their attitude.'
But how has Hungary, with this rich inheritance, produced such a dismal set
of economic statistics? One generous theory is that Hungary has gone
furthest of the former Communist countries in making bankruptcy a real
discipline on corporate behaviour. The government has also spent the most -
Dollars 3bn so far - in shoring up state banks made technically insolvent by
defaulting clients.
The measures should eventually bring benefits. But the bill comes first:
lay-offs at bankrupt enterprises; high borrowing rates charged by troubled
banks; and government bail-outs which fuel the budget deficit.
There are, however, less charitable explanations for Hungary's poor economic
performance. 'The fact that Hungary started reforms earlier is in some ways
a disadvantage,' concedes Mr Szapary.
The sense of being ahead has sometimes induced complacency. 'Politicians
could afford the luxury of not reforming and that is what they have been
doing,' says Mr Laszlo Csaba of the Kopint-Datorg economic research
institute.
Moreover, Hungary's economic development in the 1980s was a mixed blessing.
It was financed largely by foreign borrowing. Even the central bank admits
that Hungary's debt ratios - debt service was 45.5 per cent of current
account revenues in 1993 - are 'very near the critical point'. The uniquely
heavy burden has stood out all the more as Poland, Yugoslavia, Russia and
Bulgaria have defaulted and moved towards rescheduling.
Mr Almos Kovacs, a deputy president of the National Bank of Hungary, issues
the kind of advice a doctor might give to one of the many Hungarians with
heart conditions: 'Since we have this additional constraint that these
others don't have we must be careful how we generate economic growth.'
Another legacy is obstinate inflation. Price controls were lifted earlier
and more gradually than in other east European countries. That meant that
inflation peaked at 38 per cent, lower than elsewhere. The downside is that
expectations of inflation are built in to the public consciousness. Phased
adjustment in prices has also allowed wages to keep up more than they could
in Poland and the Czech Republic. Corporate profitability has suffered.
Hungary's reforming communists may also have institutionalised a
western-style welfare system too early - at a time when it seemed that the
country could afford generous benefits and exorbitant tax rates. Mr Janos
Kornai, an economist, coined a phrase: Hungary has developed a 'premature
welfare state'.
His Swedish colleague, Mr Anders Aslund, looks no further for an explanation
of Hungary's malaise. 'There is little reason to expect economic dynamism
from Hungary when only Sweden has a higher tax burden.'
But others insist that it is not yet time to write the country off. One
favoured metaphor for eastern Europe's arduous economic transition is the
10,000 metre race. One should not judge the outcome by the position after
the first lap.
Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the new Socialist finance minister, is after all making
the most serious effort in years to get to grips with welfare spending.
And the sophistication of people, companies and institutions must eventually
pay off in better economic performance. At least that is what Mr George
Kopits, country representative for the IMF, believes. 'They have fantastic
human capital. In this country if they moved government out of everyday
life, the economy could grow at 5 per cent plus for several years in a row.
No problem.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tungsten shortage looms as
demand grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world tungsten market, severely depressed since 1989, has picked up
smartly this year, and experts are already worrying about a future shortage
of the metal in the face of surging demand.
Government and industry representatives who met for two days earlier this
week in Geneva said they expected strong growth in tungsten demand this year
and next allied to world economic recovery.
With many tungsten mines now closed, especially in industrialised countries,
the extra demand is being met from stocks. But once stocks dry up 'the
market may face serious instability in event of a sharp recovery in world
tungsten consumption', according to the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development, which sponsored the meeting.
The price of ammonium paratungstate, a key intermediate product, has doubled
since the beginning of 1994 to around Dollars 93-95 per mtu (10kg) in
Europe. This, Unctad says, has led the industry to consider reopening
conversion facilities. However, prices of tungsten concentrates remain too
low to reverse mine closures.
World mine production of tungsten slumped from a peak of 60,426 tonnes
(metal content), in 1989 to 30,286 tonnes in 1993 the lowest level since the
1960s. That compared with consumption of ores and concentrates of 32,967
tonnes last year.
Mines in industrialised countries are producing only a tenth of their output
at the beginning of the 1980s and in developing countries only about a
fifth. Even in China, the world's biggest producer, mine production has more
than halved since the late 1980s to less than 20,000 tonnes in 1993.
Unctad says the recent imposition by the US and the European Union of
anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese concentrates gives an opening to
Russia - though it too has suffered from disrupted production.
In the much longer term the outlook for tungsten is mixed, according to Mr
Peter Johnson of the US Metal Powder Industries Federation. He told the
meeting that while industrial developments offered potentially important
market opportunities - notably in electronics, medical equipment, armaments
and cutting tools - some traditional uses were likely to decline.
Cermets and ceramics were increasingly used in place of tungsten carbide and
the longer life of cutting tools was reducing replacement demand. The US
industry would also have to face up to the impact of lower spending on
defence equipment and intense foreign competition in aircraft applications,
Mr Johnson said.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India aims for sugar
self-suficiency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
India expects to increase its sugar production to 12.2m tonnes from 9.8m
tonnes and to be self-sufficient in the commodity in the season starting
October this year. This reverses a steady decline in sugar production over
the past three years, when the country had to rely on imports to meet
domestic demand.
Mr Kalpnath Rai, the Food minister, said this week that the Narasimha Rao
government's policy of offering remunerative prices to sugar farmers had
yielded a bumper cane crop in the 1994-95 season.
India imported 1.9m tonnes of sugar this year, though last year's production
of 9.8m tonnes was up by 24 per cent over the previous year. The import of
1m tonnes through government-owned trading companies led to a controversy
and a subsequent jump in sugar prices.
The country's sugar industry launched a campaign for complete deregulation
of the sugar market, saying that plant capacity lay idle because of the
government's system of monitoring the distribution of cane. The government
has yet to decide on the issue.
The minister said the government had cleared 74 licences for the setting up
of sugar factories, which would raise sugar production by another 2.5m
tonnes in the near future. Mr Rai said the total price payable to cane
growers this season increased to Rs54.43bn, compared to Rs44.23bn in
1993-94. Almost 99 per cent of the amount had already been paid by sugar
mills to growers as a result of the government's efforts.
The government distributes sugar through a subsidised public distribution
system using ration cards. Sugar is available on the open market but at much
higher prices.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices continue to fluctuate without a positive overall trend, at least in
the short term. A peak in mid-September was followed by a sharp setback, but
recovery from this failed to establish a new peak before the market fell
back slightly last week. This minor downturn also failed to develop further
and Australia's Eastern market indicator rose 9 cents to 790 during this
week's sales. The New Zealand market eased, with the indicator there down by
14 cents to 543 NZ cents a kg. The US dollar's fluctuations, which have
relevance for currencies in wool producing countries as well as for wool and
textile trade more widely, have tended to push up prices in many wool
textile manufacturing countries but have at the same time tended to make
buyers further down the trading line even more reluctant to operate.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea planters to suspend
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's major tea companies, hit by falling exports and growing stocks, have
decided to halt production during the three months to February, reports
Reuters from Bombay.
Traders said the industry had been facing a glut for the past two years,
caused by two bumper crops and dwindling exports to Russia, once the biggest
buyer of Indian tea.
'Now we are strapped with huge stocks, and some of that is of inferior
quality. The halt in production was thus unavoidable,' explained Mr Vijay
Dudeja, chairman of Paramount Tea Marketing.
According to the Consultative Committee of Planters' Association, production
will be suspended in all prime plantation areas in the eastern and
north-eastern regions. These include the gardens of Assam, Terrai, Dooars
and Cacchar, which account for nearly 50 per cent of the country's total
output.
'We need to export at least 180m to 200m kg of tea every year to prevent an
uncomfortable surplus, but that has failed to happen,' said Mr Dudeja.
India's annual exports have not risen beyond 140m kg in the past two years.
In the three years following the collapse in 1991 of the Soviet Union, which
had been buying nearly 100m kg a year, they fell by at least 55m kg.
That had resulted in a 12 to 15 per cent cut in the prices of all good and
medium quality teas, Mr Dudeja said.
Traders said the situation had worsened this year after most planters
stepped up production in anticipation of higher purchases by Russia under a
debt repayment deal. 'The speculation, however, has backfired, with the
Russian buying not picking up as expected,' said Mr Haresh Parekh of tea
brokers J. Thomas &amp; Company.
Traders estimate that 1994 production will touch 770m kg, up from the
previous year's 758m, adding further to the rising stockpile.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rhone Poulenc to launch
integrated farming trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone Poulenc, one of Europe's largest agrochemicals groups, said yesterday
that it would start an experiment in Integrated Crop Management to run
alongside its trial organic farm in Ongar, Essex.
The company said it would monitor its use of agrochemicals and artificial
fertilisers more closely as well as looking at the use of rotation systems
and different forms of cultivation in order to farm in a more
environmentally-friendly way. 'We are really taking modern technology and
combining it with the best traditional methods,' an official said.
The new study will take place on 24 hectares on the company's Bundish Hall
Farm, which is adjacent to Boarded Barns where organic methods have been
employed on 24 hectares for the past five years.
Rhone Poulenc has found that the gross margins on its organic sector have
consistently been around half of those achieved on its conventional acres.
Over a four-year period, the cumulative gross margin per hectare has been
Pounds 2,557 for the organic part and Pounds 5,487 for the conventional
fields.
'All our indications are that the gap will continue to widen between the
organic and conventional profit levels,' said a company official, 'with ICM
we're looking at a refinement of the conventional system.'
The new ICM approach aims to be as profitable as conventional farming since
any slight reduction in yields should be compensated for by the lower cost
of agrochemicals and other inputs which will be reduced.
A large cost for the organic land is the need to grow a fertility crop such
as clover every couple of years in the land's rotation system to improve
soil fertility.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish pigmeat co-ops study
merger proposal - A controversial plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danish co-operative slaughterhouses, which already include some of the
largest pigmeat companies in Europe, are considering merging to form what
the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses claims would be the biggest
pigmeat processing group in the world.
At this stage the idea is only the subject of a debate among the farmers who
own the businesses; there have been no merger negotiations as such.
If the merger takes place the resulting company will be the second largest
industrial group in Denmark, with a turnover of between DKr30bn and DKr40bn
(Pounds 3.12bn-Pounds 4.16bn).
Denmark's pigmeat industry has turned in an impressive performance since it
made its reputation at the beginning of this century as a supplier of bacon
for the British breakfast table. It now claims world market shares of 20 to
30 per cent, varying by product, for internationally-traded pigmeat. The
country has only 5m people, but produces 20m pigs a year, exporting 80 per
cent of the pigmeat produced. Pigmeat is Denmark's largest single export
product, worth about DKr18bn in 1993, about 8 per cent of the country's
merchandise exports.
The industry owes its success, say the Danes, to the co-operative structure,
which gives farmers control all the way from the pig sty - through breeding
and processing to sales and marketing.
'We are able to produce raw material of a uniform high quality, and have a
system of production which meets the consumer's demand for pure, healthy and
nourishing meat products,' says Mr Bent Sloth, pig farmer and chairman of
the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses.
The industry has rationalised rapidly. Three decades ago there were almost
100 co-operative slaughterhouse companies; now there are just four - Danish
Crown, Vestjyske (West Jutland), Steff Houlberg, and Tican - plus the
associated companies that process meat into hams, sausages and other
value-added products.
Mr Sloth favours the merger, which in itself is a sign of how the idea has
matured. His predecessor as chairman was voted out in the mid-1980s for
supporting a proposal for a pigmeat monopoly company.
'It is time for the Danish pig industry to give priority to competing with
the pig producers of other countries rather than with each other,' Mr Sloth
declares in an issue of the slaughterhouse association's magazine devoted to
the merger issue. He argues that if the Danish companies do not merge with
each other one or other of them may well merge instead with a foreign
company. 'But if the supplier chain is extended to other countries, where
the same quality guarantees cannot be provided, we risk losing all the
advantages which the Danish industry enjoys.'
He does not think there is any risk of loss of commercial dynamism if
domestic competition is largely eliminated. The company would be measured by
its ability to pay its farmer-suppliers a better price for their pigs than
the co-operatives' foreign competitors are able to pay theirs, he argues,
and this would keep the company on its competitive toes.
The chairmen of the four co-operatives are less sure. Mr Bent Claudi Lassen,
chairman of Danish Crown, the largest of them, concedes that there will be
advantages in terms of international sales and marketing strength, as well
as economies of scale to be exploited. But counterbalancing these
advantages, in his view, are the problems of managing such a gigantic
enterprise.
Mr Bent Maribo, chairman of Steff Houlberg, ranking third among the four, is
unequivocally opposed to a one-company solution. 'It will not mean a
strengthening, but a weakening, of the Danish sales position,' he says.
International buyers, especially in Japan, which is the most valuable export
market for Danish pigmeat, want to have a choice of suppliers, and if there
is only one Danish company, they will exercise their choice by buying more
from Taiwan, the US and France, he warns. For similar reasons, Danish buyers
will begin buying a higher proportion of their meat from abroad, while the
private Danish suppliers, who account for about 4 per cent of the market,
will gain market shares as well.
Domestic competition, says Mr Maribo, is one of the factors which has made
the Danish slaughterhouses among the most efficient in the world. Eliminate
this competition 'and measuring success will be difficult', he says. Mr Egon
Kristensen, chairman of Vestjyske, agrees. 'Monopolies haven't always been
the most efficient,' he points out.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT-Actuaries Fixed Interest Indices Committee has decided to cease the
calculation and publication of the Debenture and Unsecured Loan Stock Index
from December 31 1994. The main reason for this decision is that changes in
the structure of the market have reduced the number of liquid stocks with an
adequate range of maturity dates. The committee feels as a result that the
integrity of the Debenture and Unsecured Loan Stock Index can no longer be
guaranteed.
Investors in debenture and unsecured loan stocks will find a variety of

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian chocolate maker
raises Dollars 30m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International investors are to be offered the opportunity to invest directly
in Krasny Oktyabr (Red October), the profitable Russian chocolate maker.
A public offer scheduled to take place later this month in three Russian
cities was open to local investors and foreigners, said Mr Richard Oliver,
associate director with Samuel Montagu, one of the western firms involved.
The project, sponsored by the British government's Know How fund and the
Russian Securities and Exchange Commission, aims to raise up to Dollars 30m
through the offer to be launched in Moscow, St Petersburg and Ekaterinburg.
About 55 per cent of the company's shares are being sold priced at Rbs20,000
each.
About 20 per cent of the shares are to be set aside for strategic investors,
such as western companies with an interest in the foods sector. But the
issue will be targeted at a wide range of investors, but we want to get
'retail investors involved,' said Mr Oliver.
A number of specialist Russian funds, formed over the past 18 months, are
expected to take some of the equity. These have been the most popular means
of investing although earlier this month international trading began in the
shares of RSNG, the large oil and gas construction company, following the
successful placement of about Dollars 25m of paper with international
investors.
Mr Oliver said Krasny's smaller and well-defined business was much easier to
value than the large energy- and oil-related concerns interesting western
investors.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries encouraged by inflation
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday morning after government figures
on producer prices indicated a possible slowdown in inflationary pressures
where economists had predicted an increase.
By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  9/16 at 93 23/32 ,
yielding 8.052 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was up  3/32 at 99 13/32 , to yield 6.977 per cent.
Sparking the price gains was a labour department report that showed producer
prices down 0.5 per cent for October, the same as in September. Most
analysts had predicted that October prices would increase 0.1 per cent.
'I think it is very good as far as inflation is concerned, but it is not the
end of the story,' said Ms Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at
brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. In spite of the figures, she
maintained her opinion that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise its
interest rate target by 50 basis points next week at its open market
committee meeting. However, she said the inflation news lowered the chance
that the Fed would move to raise rates by as much as 100 points.
A strong showing by the dollar added to positive sentiment in the bond
markets. In early trading, the dollar pushed up to Y98.06 against the
Japanese yen and DM1.536 against the D-Mark.
Europe's bond markets once again took their cues from Treasuries, and most
of them posted moderate gains on the back of the US bond market's rise.
However, turnover remained thin as market participants remained reluctant to
increase their exposure ahead of Tuesday's FOMC meeting.
German bonds rose about  1/3 point in moderate volume in largely technical
dealings. The December bund futures contract on DTB ended at 90.31, 0.33
point on the day, but drifted lower in after-hours trading on Liffe.
As expected, the Bundesbank's central bank council left official interest
rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting and set another two rounds of
securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 4.85 per cent.
UK gilts had a lacklustre session, closing slightly lower as the Bank of
England's tap issues kept a lid on prices. The December long gilt future
closed around 101 11/32 , down  1/4 point.
A Pounds 250m tranche of 8 1/2 per cent gilt due 2005, one of four tap
stocks announced on Friday, was exhausted in the afternoon, the Bank said. A
Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked bonds due 2009 was
exhausted on Wednesday. The others, a Pounds 100m tranche of 2 1/2 per cent
index-linked stock due 2024 and a Pounds 250m tranche of 8 3/4 per cent
stock due 2017 have not been sold out.
French bonds underperformed bunds, with their yield premium widening to 75
basis points from 69 on Wednesday. In addition to position-squaring ahead of
today's national holiday, the weak franc weighed on bonds, dealers said.
Although the market is likely to come under further pressure amid
uncertainty over the May presidential elections, Mr Adrian James, bond
market strategist at NatWest Markets recommends buying French bonds on
weakness. However, 'you've got to be prepared to take a six-month view to
see value in the French market,' he warned.
Swedish bonds had another strong day, lifted by a poll indicating that the
supporters of European Union membership might hold a majority after all. The
yield on the benchmark 11-year bond fell 23 basis points to 11.20 per cent.
With a large pool of voters still allegedly undecided, the outcome of
Sunday's referendum remains unclear.
The markets still appear to be slightly biased towards a 'yes' and are
likely to experience only a brief rally should it materialise.
However, a 'no' could put heavy pressure on Sweden's currency and bonds.
Traders said Sweden's yield spread over bunds could return to this year's
high of around 500 basis points, from 376 at present.

The euromarkets saw a small number of issues yesterday, mainly with a short
maturity and targeted at retail investors, although some syndicate managers
reported large purchases by institutions.
Issuance is expected to decline until after the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting on Tuesday. Syndicate managers suggested the Republic of
Italy might wait to see the impact of the FOMC meeting on US interest rates
before issuing its long-awaited Y400bn bond, which could come in three
tranches; a three-year, a 20-year, and a tranche of between six and 10
years.
In the US dollar sector, the largest deal yesterday was the Republic of
Austria, which brought a Dollars 200m bond via Lehman Brothers, which said
the strong name had stimulated very strong European retail demand. 'I've had
syndicate managers coming out of the woodwork trying to get into this deal,'
said a Lehman official.
Norddeutsche Landesbank brought a Dollars 150m bond via Paribas Capital
Markets, which said the offering had been greeted with solid demand in
Switzerland and Belgium, as well as Germany and south-east Asia. Some UK
institutions had bought the bonds, which were given a 13-month first coupon
to help the borrower effect a swap.
The first Argentine corporate borrower since the Republic of Argentina
brought its Dollars 500m global deal last month braved the euromarkets
yesterday. Yesterday's bond came from Astra Compania Argentina de Petrolio,
the Argentine oil and gas group which has been listed on the stock market in
Switzerland for 70 years, via Swiss Bank Corporation which reported strong
demand, some of it from US institutions. The bonds came at 412 basis points
over US Treasuries. The Republic's bonds were brought to market at a spread
of around 350 basis points over US Treasury bonds, and by yesterday had
widened out to around 366 basis points over.
Banco Nacional, the Brazilian bank, brought an Dollars 80m bond via Citibank
which targeted the offering at retail Swiss, US, Latin American and Asian
investors. The deal had been talked about as a Dollars 75m bond but was
increased to Dollars 80m. When freed to trade, the bonds tightened by one
basis point.
Two issuers each brought Pounds 100m sterling deals. Portman Building
Society, the UK's 14th largest, via BZW which said the deal offered an
alternative to expensive paper in the secondary market.
Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein brought a Pounds 100m bond through HSBC
Markets, which reported strong demand with blocks of Pounds 5m and Pounds 7m
being sold to institutions attracted by the highly-rated name.
In the Australian dollar sector, ABM Amro Australia brought a ADollars 100m
bond through ABM Amro, which reported strong demand with one block of
ADollars 25m going to a buyer in the Netherlands. The Council of Europe
issued a ADollars 100m bond through BZW.
Syndicates are expecting the first convertible bond to emerge from Brazil
this month. It is expected to be a Dollars 100m issue with a 10-year
maturity from a highly-rated company.

Demand for the issue is said to be strong, as existing shareholders are

<TEXT>
The senior debt rating of JP Morgan, the US commercial bank, faces a
possible downgrade by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, in a move that
highlights a growing divergence of views about the bank among rating
agencies, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Moody's alreadys accords JP Morgan a lower rating, at AA1, than rival US
rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, which earlier this year affirmed its own
top AAA rating for the bank.
Moody's said it would review JP Morgan's position in the investment banking
business, where it has been expanding. In light of strong competition and a
difficult regulatory background, the bank 'faces challenges in establishing
itself as the pre-eminent provider of investment banking services', Moody's
said.
Morgan attacked the decision, saying that its earnings in the first nine
months were the second-highest on record and that its capital ratios had
never been stronger.

Sankyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sankyo, a leading Japanese pharmaceuticals company, posted a firm rise in
earnings due to strong sales of its anti-cholesterol drug Mevalotin, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The company posted an 8.4 per cent rise in recurring profits - before
extraordinary items and tax - to Y43bn (Dollars 439m) in spite of a 2 per
cent decline in sales to Y202.2bn.
The fall in sales was triggered by cuts in official drug prices by the
ministry of health and welfare, and the transfer of sales rights of Zaditen,
an asthma drug, to the Japanese arm of Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical
group.
The company posted a 5.6 per cent rise in operating profits to Y42.3bn and
an 11.2 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y19.2bn.
Sales of its drug division fell 1.9 per cent to Y180.7bn although Mevalotin
and Loxonine, an analgesic drug developed by Sankyo, saw sales increases.
Revenue from agro-chemicals sales fell 0.6 per cent to Y12bn.
For the full year to March, the company expects current profits to rise 3.4
per cent to Y83bn while sales are expected to remain flat at Y396bn.

<TEXT>
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, and France's Rhone-Poulenc said
yesterday they were suspending talks on creating a joint venture for the
production of soda ash because they could not agree on the ownership of the
new company,
As part of plans unveiled in late May, Rhone-Poulenc, the world's
third-largest soda ash producer, was to have held 67 per cent of the joint
venture, with Akzo Nobel owning the rest.
In later negotiations, both sides wanted a larger stake, and the gap between
the two could not be bridged. However, Akzo Nobel and Rhone-Poulenc held out
the possibility that talks might be resumed later because the industrial
logic between the partnership in soda ash remained intact.
The planned joint venture, originally scheduled to get under way in January,
was to have had annual turnover equivalent to Fl 300m (Dollars 175m) and a
workforce of more than 600.
Rhone-Poulenc was planning to contribute its plant in Nancy, France, while
Akzo Nobel was prepared to transfer ownership of its production site in
Delfzijl, in the Netherlands.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) is to move part of its accounting operation to
China to cut costs and circumvent labour shortages in Singapore. SIA said
the state owned accounting centre of China aviation would process SIA ticket
data, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
'Given the shortage of labour in Singapore, this will lessen the problem of
recruitment and also result in cost savings for SIA,' the airline said. SIA
is in the process of moving other back room operations to India and other
low-cost centres. It has also taken a stake in an aircraft maintenance
facility being built in China.
SIA is concerned that growing labour and associated costs at home plus the
continuing strength of the Singapore dollar are threatening the airline's
competitiveness. Last month SIA reported a 20 per cent rise in group
operating profits of SDollars 478m (Dollars 322m) for the half year to
September.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesian tycoon Mr Oei Hong-leong has emerged as an investor in Ming Pao,
the prestige Hong Kong daily newspaper whose chairman was forced to resign
last month amid revelations concerning a past criminal conviction.
Mr Oei's China Strategic Holdings will buy a 10 per cent stake in Ming Pao
from CIM, the newspaper's controlling shareholder, in a deal valued at about
HKDollars 200m (USDollars 25.87m).
Mr Yu Pun-hoi, Ming Pao former chairman and chairman of CIM, said CIM had no
interest in disposing of its controlling interest in Ming Pao. A 10 per cent
stake would be disposed of in two tranches of 18m shares each over the
coming three months and would leave CIM still owning 50 per cent of the
company.
Since Mr Yu's resignation last month, in response to the censure by the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange over his failure to declare a 1979 criminal conviction,
the Hong Kong market has been awash with rumour and speculation about CIM's
continued ownership of Ming Pao.
Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian financier, and Mr Jimmy Lai, the publisher of
Next magazine, were rumoured to have been interested in acquiring an
interest in Ming Pao. In the end it was Mr Oei - whose family controls Sinar
Mas, Indonesia's second largest business empire - who emerged in the lead.
In addition to his private interest in Indonesia, Mr Oei is a big investor
in property in Singapore, where he has made his home. In Hong Kong, he is
chairman of China Strategic which is his family's vehicle for investment in
China.
The company has many joint ventures in China but most of its profits come
from three areas of activity: it is China's biggest tyre manufacturer, it
produces about 10 per cent of the country's output of paper, and it owns
five breweries.
A year ago Mr Oei joined a consortium of Asian businessmen who paid
USDollars 10m for a 70 per cent interest in Myanmar International Airways -
the flag carrier of Myanmar (formerly Burma).

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japan's chemicals groups slip in
first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's chemical industry continued to suffer from falling prices and weak
demand in the first half of this year. However, its leading companies
believe cost-cutting will help them lift earnings in the current half, an
example of how lower margin manufacturing sectors will continue to be
squeezed even as Japan moves into an economic recovery.
That was the message from yesterday's interim reports from three of the
leading chemicals groups: Mitsubishi Kasei, Japan's leading general
chemicals producer; Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the country's largest
petrochemicals group; and Asahi Chemical, the leading maker of synthetic
fibres.
The two Mitsubishi companies, which merged last month to form Mitsubishi
Chemical in an attempt to pool costs and achieve economies of scale, both
reported losses in the six months to September. Losses rose at the
petrochemical company, while the general chemicals group swung into the red
from a profit in the first half of last year.
Asahi only managed to raise its recurring profits - before extraordinary
items and tax - by selling securities, a common technique used by Japanese
companies to tide themselves through hard times.
Mitsubishi Chemical is sticking to its forecast of a combined Y10bn (Dollars
102m) recurring profit in the full year to March. That compares with a
combined loss of Y6.18bn last year, composed of a Y2.21bn profit from
Mitsubishi Kasei and a Y8.39bn recurring loss from Mitsubishi Petrochemical.
The merged group forecasts sales of Y855bn in its first year, 16 per cent
down on its partners' combined Y1,023bn in 1993.
The new group's petrochemical arm is hoping that it will be able to pass on
a rise in oil prices to an increase in product prices in the current half.
The bulk chemicals division is counting on a recovery in production, after
having to reduce output during Japan's summer water shortage. Both expect to
benefit from the cost savings achieved by reducing their combined number of
divisions.
Asahi yesterday upgraded its sales forecast for the full year, by Y20bn to
Y980bn, a 4.6 per cent rise on the 12 months to last March. It made a Y3.8bn
capital gain on securities to achieve its recurring profit of Y9.65bn in the
first half, a 10 per cent increase on the same period last year. But
operating profits fell, by 5.8 per cent to Y9.8bn, on sales down by 1.5 per
cent. Demand for textiles and synthetic resins was especially weak, said the
company.
The smaller Nippon Chemical cut recurring profits to Y303m from Y941m a year
ago.

Perth-based Challenge Bank, the Australian regional bank, said yesterday
that it intended to make an offer for Bank-West, a significantly larger,
state-owned bank which the Western Australia government plans to privatise
next year.
Challenge said it was confident its bid would be about ADollars 100m
(USDollars 75.56m) more than the state government would receive from a
public float of the company. However, Challenge made no mention of the
specific offer it would make.
Challenge, whose desire to acquire BankWest has been widely known, said the
combined strength of the two organisations in terms of market position,
profitability and funding would maximise the prospect of BankWest remaining
permanently domiciled in Western Australia.
'The merged entity can be funded, at the outset and over time, through a
planned and systematic programme of accessing the domestic and international
debt markets,' it said.
Challenge Bank is estimated to have a 9 per cent share of the WA market,
with a loan book around ADollars 2bn. BankWest is larger, with 27.6 per cent
of the market and a loan book of more than ADollars 6bn. BankWest's gross
assets are around ADollars 12.5bn, while Challenge has ADollars 5bn,
according to its 1993-94 balance sheet.
BankWest said: 'It (Challenge) has failed to spell out how it would
implement a merger. In contrast, a straight float ensures that the full
benefits of privatisation would go to the people of WA.'
Meanwhile, the state government said it would not be pressured on the
privatisation of BankWest.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Inco digs deep to squeeze costs
 -The nickel producer is celebrating rising prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a difference a year has made at Inco. Twelve months ago, the western
world's biggest nickel producer was trimming its sails to cope with what
looked like an unremitting market slump.
Inco produced 15,000 tonnes, or about 8 per cent, less nickel last year than
in 1992. As the nickel price dipped to a low of USDollars 1.80 a lb in
September 1993, it cut output by another 18,000 tonnes and pared capital
spending to the bone. Some feared the Toronto-based company, which supplies
about a third of western nickel output, might buckle under its Dollars 1.1bn
debt burden.
The mood was just the opposite at Inco's board meeting in the last week of
October. The three-month nickel price had climbed to more than Dollars 3 a
lb, hitting a peak of Dollars 3.45 last week. The directors were
sufficiently confident of the outlook to approve a clutch of new projects at
its Ontario and Manitoba mines.
They include the Dollars 158m development of the McCreedy East deposit, near
Sudbury, Ontario, which is expected to produce 22.5m lbs of nickel (equal to
about 6 per cent of 1993 output) and 77.5m lbs of copper a year by 1999.
In addition Inco has just given the go-ahead for a drilling programme at
what is believed to be a rich orebody, known as Pipe Deep, in Manitoba. It
is also pressing ahead with development of another high-grade orebody, known
as Victor, near its existing operations at Sudbury.
Plans have been unveiled to install a Dollars 13.6m ore-handling system as a
prelude to deepening the Creighton mine at Sudbury.
'It's our intention to get every pound of nickel possible out of the
ground,' an Inco official says. Another 'good news' announcement, on which
the company declines to elaborate at this stage, is scheduled for early next
week.
The turnround has begun to show in Inco's earnings. Primary metal operations
have swung from a Dollars 19m loss in the third quarter of 1993 to a Dollars
39m profit this year, in spite of an accident at a Manitoba mine which cut
third-quarter output by 3,600 tonnes.
The median forecast of a group of 13 North American analysts suggests that
Inco will recover from a loss of about 40 cents a share this year to
earnings of Dollars 1.50 a share in 1995. Those looking further ahead
bravely predict earnings will climb to about Dollars 2.25 in 1996.
Mr Peter Marcus, analyst at PaineWebber in New York, is increasingly
confident that his 'good case' scenario of an average 1995 nickel price of
Dollars 5 a lb will be realised.
Much of the renewed optimism rests on unexpectedly buoyant demand from
stainless steel makers, who make up about 60 per cent of western nickel
consumption. Inco has raised its forecast of 1994 stainless steel production
by 5 per cent to 12.6m tonnes.
As a result, its estimate of nickel demand has climbed by 18,000 tonnes to
711,000 tonnes.
Inco predicts a similar rise in western supplies during 1995, reflecting the
return of mothballed mines to the market, and new capacity in western
Australia and Indonesia.
This would bring the market roughly into balance. Mr Fraser Phillips,
analyst at ScotiaMcLeod in Toronto, predicts that while a price correction
could occur over the next six months, inventories should start dropping in
late 1995 and prices should then improve sharply.
This optimistic view of nickel's prospects hinges on stagnant, or falling,
Russian exports. Uncontrolled shipments from Russia and eastern Europe have
been one of the most disruptive forces in the nickel market in recent years.
Ms Stephanie Anderson, Inco director of market research, said in a recent
paper that Russian deliveries to the west would be 'the swing factor that
dictates the direction nickel prices take in the future'.
Supplies from former communist countries are expected to be about 126,000
tonnes this year, or 18 per cent of worldwide nickel supplies.
According to Ms Anderson, Norilsk, the main Russian producer, cannot sustain
its output without investment and regular maintenance to mine and plant
equipment. 'Based on a lack of capital spending alone, not to mention the
social and political problems, production at Norilsk could well fall,' she
said.
But she also acknowledged that 'it is almost impossible to quantify what is
really happening to (the Russian) industry'.
No matter what happens, Inco hopes to benefit from its drive over the past
three years to cut costs, especially at its Canadian operations. According
to Mr Marcus, break-even costs may be down to Dollars 2.25 a lb within the
next few years. Unit costs in the early 1990s were around Dollars 2.45 a lb.
The nickel market has become increasingly volatile as banks and investment
funds have emerged as important forces. The daily open interest on the
London Metal Exchange - that is, the number of contracts which have not been
closed off by metal deliveries - has soared from 48,000 tonnes in 1990 to
around 340,000 tonnes. Trading volumes have surged fivefold to 70,000 tonnes
a day.
Mr Marcus at PaineWebber estimates Inco's earnings a share rise or fall by
Dollars 2 for each Dollars 1 movement in nickel prices.
For the time being, volatile markets are working to the advantage of
producers. But Inco's ability to weather future downturns is likely to hang
on its success in maintaining the costs squeeze, even as it celebrates
rising metal prices.

Standard Chartered Bank, the operating bank of UK multinational banking
group Standard Chartered, said yesterday that it had completed a HKDollars
2.5bn (USDollars 32.5m) issue of floating rate certificates of deposit aimed
at lowering the cost of funding its assets in Asia, writes Simon Holberton.
The bank said it had nearly doubled the issue in response to market demand.
The FRCDs will pay an annual rate of interest equivalent to 35 basis points
above the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate.

Four Seasons Hotels, the luxury chain in which Saudi Arabia's Prince
Al-Waleed recently bought a minority stake, has benefited from a strong
recovery in the international hotel business.
The Toronto-based company's third-quarter earnings climbed to CDollars 3.2m
(USDollars 2.4m) or 12 cents a share, from CDollars 398,000, or 2 cents, a
year earlier.
Revenues rose to CDollars 409.1m from CDollars 326.1m. Operating earnings
climbed by 59 per cent to CDollars 14.5m.
The yield at Four Seasons and Regent hotels, defined as occupancy multiplied
by the realised room rate, rose 17 per cent. Reservations climbed 20 per
cent in the first nine months of this year which, according to Four Seasons,
points to further growth ahead.
Next year's performance should be bolstered by new hotels which opened this
year in Mexico City and Singapore, and a resort in Palm Beach.
New properties are due to open over the next 12 months in Chiang Mai
(Thailand), Jakarta and Istanbul.
Four Seasons said that its debt, totalling CDollars 367m, remains
unacceptably high. It expects to lighten the debt burden by about one-third
by the end of 1995, mainly through asset disposals.
It announced yesterday that it had sold its real estate interest in the Four
Seasons hotel in Austin, Texas, and its 15 per cent equity stake in the
Boston Four Seasons.
The group is seeking a buyer for its flagship property in London.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Allstate shaken by earthquake -
Reducing disaster exposure is a key to earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judged by its profits, Allstate has been one of the most volatile of all US
insurance companies. Last year, the US's second-biggest car and home insurer
made Dollars 1.3bn of profits after tax - equivalent to a 19 per cent return
on capital. That is almost unheard of for the US personal property/casualty
insurance industry, where premium rates are controlled by state regulators.
Then came the earthquake centred in Northridge, California. With its 12-13
per cent of the US car and homeowners' insurance market, Allstate was hit
hard by January's earthquake. Like others, the company has revised its
estimate of losses upwards several times during the year. The latest figure
is Dollars 1.3bn.
For Sears, Roebuck which first floated nearly 20 per cent of the company on
the stock market in early 1993 and yesterday announced a plan to spin off
the remainder, this was nothing new. Two years ago Allstate took a Dollars
2.7bn hit from Hurricane Andrew in Florida, the biggest natural disaster (in
insurance terms) to have afflicted the US.
All of this makes Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, one of the purest
stock market plays in the US personal property/casualty business. State
Farm, its bigger rival with about 20 per cent of the US homeowners and car
insurance market (and Dollars 1.5bn of losses from Northridge) is a mutually
owned company. Farmers, the third-biggest insurer whose concentration on the
West Coast landed it with an estimated Dollars 1.3bn of losses from the
earthquake, is owned by BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial
services group.
Reducing its exposure to natural disasters is one of the keys to future
earnings. After taking account of reinsurance cover, Allstate's Northridge
losses amount to about 11 per cent of its capital, according to Mr Peter
Wade, associate director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency.
Subjecting the company's balance sheet to various disaster scenarios
suggests that about 25-30 per cent of its capital could be at risk, he adds.
Allstate is now trying to reduce that to below 20 per cent - although
regulations in states such as Florida hinder this process. The scarcity of
reinsurance coverage for catastrophe losses has also made the task difficult
to accomplish.
As long as it is perceived to face higher catastrophe risks than other
insurance groups, Allstate is likely to continue to trade on a lower
price/earnings multiple (its shares trade on a multiple of about nine times
earnings before catastrophe losses, some two points below the average
insurance group).
'To some extent, the discount may reflect the controlling interest of
Sears,' Mr Myron Piccoult, an insurance analyst at Oppenheimer, suggested
recently. However, he added that the catastrophe exposure was the bigger
concern. In the short-term, the company's share price is likely to be held
back by the release of Sears' 360m shares, many of them into the hands of
investors who will no doubt waste no time in selling them on the market.
In the meantime, Allstate continues to run one of the most effective sales
machines in the US insurance business. Sears was in the financial services
business long before it became fashionable - it established the company in
1931 to sell car insurance through its catalogues and stores - and Allstate
runs a successful retail network in its own right. The insurance business
still bears the hallmarks of its origins, with car policies contributing
about two-thirds of premium income from the property/casualty business.
(About 15 per cent of the company's total premiums last year came from life
insurance.)
Unlike its rivals, Allstate operates through a network of agents who sell
only Allstate policies. These 15,000 agents, spread across North America,
brought in Dollars 20.9bn of premiums last year. The network was built up
during the 1980s, a period of rapid expansion when Allstate moved away from
its traditional base in Sears' stores.
The company has less turnover among its agents than other insurers and more
success at selling additional policies to existing customers, of whom it
claims 20m. That makes a free-standing Allstate a powerful force - provided
it can tame the catastrophe losses, of course.

The Gap
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New store openings and better profit margins at existing stores helped The
Gap, the US casual wear retailer, produce a 19 per cent increase in net
profits to a record Dollars 93.6m in its third quarter to October.
The company said its Banana Republic stores had turned in an impressive
performance, but revenues at The Gap stores fell below target because the
merchandise did not sell as well as had been expected.
Earnings per share rose from 54 cents to 64 cents.
At the quarter's end, The Gap operated 877 Gap stores, 354 GapKids stores,
184 Banana Republic stores and 62 Old Navy or Gap Warehouse stores. The
total of 1,477 represented an increase of 92 over the year-earlier figure.
The group's sales revenues rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 988.3m, but only
because of the new store openings. Sales at stores that had been open for
more than a year fell by 2 per cent.
The sales decline at existing stores, however, was offset by an increase in
margins stemming from control over costs and a better merchandise mix, which
reduced the need for price mark-downs to clear goods.
Last year The Gap suffered a fall in profits prompted by a combination of
expansion costs, weak consumer demand and competition from other store
groups imitating The Gap basic clothing formula.
Since then The Gap has shifted its product mix away from basic, unisex
clothing such as T-shirts and jeans to more fashionable and gender-specific
merchandise, particularly for women.

   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cray Computer, the struggling supercomputer developer, has announced a new
model which it claims will match the performance of any commercially
available supercomputer at a fraction of the price.
The new 'Cray 4' supercomputer is priced at about Dollars 6m for a system
with performance equivalent to a Dollars 25m supercomputer sold by Cray
Research, the world's leading manufacturer. Cray Computer is a spin-off from
Cray Research, formed by Mr Seymore Cray, founder of the original company
bearing his name.
Cray Computer has yet to make a single sale and its future is largely
dependent upon finding a buyer for the new Cray 4 over the next few months,
according to industry analysts. In recent months two other US supercomputer
companies, Thinking Machines and Kendall Square, have ceased manufacturing
operations.
Cray said, however, that it has some 'strong indications of interest' and
believes that it is close to receiving its first order. 'We plan to be able
to make our first delivery by the end of the first quarter of 1995,' said Mr
Charles Breckenridge, executive vice-president of marketing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hyundai Electronics America, a US subsidiary of the Hyundai group of South
Korea, has agreed to acquire the semi-conductor operations of AT&amp;T Global
Information Solutions, formerly called NCR, for more than Dollars 300m.
The acquisition is the largest of its kind by a Korean company in the US,
Hyundai said.
AT&amp;T announced in August that it was seeking a buyer for the NCR chip
operations. With sales last year of Dollars 372m, the unit employs about
1,850 people at two semiconductor plants in Colorado as well as a plant in
Wichita, Kansas, that makes circuit boards for personal computers. The
division is profitable and its sales have been growing at about 25 per cent
per year, AT&amp;T said.
Hyundai Electronics said it would retain the current management of the NCR
division, which would operate as an independent, autonomous subsidiary.
With estimated world sales of Dollars 1.05bn in 1993, Hyundai Electronics is
the third largest Korean semiconductor manufacturer, after Samsung and
Goldstar. Hyundai's semi-conductor revenues are expected to more than double
this year to about Dollars 2.5bn.
To date, however, Hyundai's semiconductor operations have been heavily
concentrated on memory chips, used in all types of computers.
'The acquisition is a strategic move to expand Hyundai Electronics' strong
presence in the global semiconductor marketplace from a volume-driven memory
business to the high value-added integrated circuit business,' said Mr YH
Kim, chief executive of Hyundai Electronics America.
The NCR Microelectronic Products division produces specialised microchips,
including application-specific integrated circuits.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: US oil and gas side of Santa Fe
Int'l for sale

<TEXT>
The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp yesterday said it would sell the US
oil and gas exploration and production operations of Santa Fe International
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Mr Nader Sultan, KPC deputy chairman, said the US operation was 'no longer a
strategic priority'.
The sale will not affect Santa Fe UK's operations in the British sector of
the North Sea.
Nor will it include Santa Fe's extensive international drilling operations.
Santa Fe was one of a series of US and European investments made by KPC
during the 1980s under the chairmanship of Sheikh Ali Al-Sabah, the then oil
minister. KPC paid Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 51 a share, for Santa Fe in
1981.
Santa Fe lost Dollars 2.9bn between 1981-90, according to official Kuwaiti
figures.
A Kuwaiti parliamentary watchdog has charged that the acquisition was a
'hasty personal idea' rather than part of a well thought-out investment
strategy.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siemens Nixdorf programmed for
change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
If Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer is worried about his company's accumulated losses
of DM2.25bn (Dollars 1.5bn), he does not show it. The new president and
chief executive of Siemens Nixdorf (SNI) seems more concerned about units of
time than D-Marks and dollars.
The Siemens group has ample funds and profits to maintain the transfusions
into its ailing information technology subsidiary which started when the
acquired Nixdorf business was clumsily grafted on to its own mainframe
operations in 1990.
However, time is a different matter and, as Mr Schulmeyer said yesterday,
the years which in normal circumstances would be needed to complete the job
of renewing SNI's culture are not available to him.
'Changing a corporation's mentality usually takes three to five years, and
we don't have it,' he told a press conference called to review his time -
132 days, as he pointed out - at the company.
'We cannot think in terms of two-year or five-year plans. We have to think
of days,' he said. 'If you don't have a major technical feature change every
six months you start to look old. You must revamp your entire product range
every 12 months or you begin to look out of step.'
Mr Schulmeyer, formerly head of Asea Brown Boveri's American operations, and
fresh from six months of teaching management at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, admitted the processes he was trying to introduce were alien
to Germany, but insisted they were essential for the success of a
high-technology, market-driven business.
'Classical functional organisational structures, in Germany especially,
inevitably lead to a fragmented way of working with all the attendant
penalties of delay, inflexibility and high overheads,' he said.
Such conflicts figured large among the well-publicised problems which
afflicted SNI from the outset, and which Mr Schulmeyer suggested yesterday
had still not been properly resolved. Insufficient attention was paid during
the unification process to reinforcing the relative advantages of the two
cultures, he said. 'The new culture - if we can speak of one at all - was
thus a chance development.
'SNI has not yet achieved a well-formulated cultural dimension,' he said.
'Siemens is still dreaming of its mainframe days and Nixdorf is still in its
mid-range mentality.
'We managers have to learn to take risks otherwise nothing will happen,' he
said.
As for the risks of his failing in his main ambition, Mr Schulmeyer said he
had given himself only a 60:40 chance of successfully changing the SNI
culture when he arrived.
Since then he had met or addressed 11,000 of the group's employees. Young
managers had been sent off for training in the US. He had employed hardened
restructuring experts with experience in cases such as Citibank and American
Airlines. All in all, he felt the odds on his success had improved to 70:30,
he said.
SNI was not teetering on the brink of disaster. It was on a healthy recovery
path, he claimed. In the current financial year, when Europe's computer
price wars would cost the group even more than last year's DM900m, the
company would make an operating profit, although further restructuring
charges would leave it with another deficit on the bottom line, he said.
Sales were expected to grow by 4 or 5 per cent and productivity was planned
to increase 15 per cent.
Although SNI lost DM350m last year, the situation had improved in the second
half when turnover rose 23 per cent. Over the whole year, personal computer
sales had increased 50 per cent compared with 1992-93. The PC division had
gained a 10.4 per cent share in Germany, was lifting sales faster than the
market, and was no longer a 'headache financially'.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bologna banks get go-ahead for
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Italy yesterday gave the go-ahead to a proposed merger between
two Bologna banks - Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) and Cassa di Risparmio in
Bologna (Carisbo) - giving them a head-start over Credito Italiano's rival
plan to take control of Rolo.
The central bank, which supervises the fragmented Italian banking sector, is
still considering Credito Italiano's plan to bid L2,000bn (Dollars 1.27bn)
in cash for a 48 per cent stake in Rolo, to add to the 2-3 per cent it
already owns.
The Bank of Italy was not expected to reject the planned merger between Rolo
and Caer, Carisbo's holding company. Earlier this year, it approved a
similar plan for an alliance between the two companies, which was then
shelved.
However, Rolo is bound to argue that the decision gives it a defensive
advantage over Credito Italiano. The Bologna bank plans a shareholder
meeting on December 19 or 20 to vote on the merger, and it is also preparing
to attack Credito Italiano's preliminary bid plans on legal grounds.
Meanwhile, Credito Valtellinese, a small northern Italian bank, announced
plans to take control of Credito Artigiano, a Milan-based bank in which it
has a 20 per cent stake.
Valtellinese said it would pay L146.3bn for a 29.27 per cent stake held by
Artigiano's majority shareholder, Fondazione Vismara, and offer to buy up a
1.73 per cent from another shareholder to take control.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cuts offset weak sales at
Pharmacia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmacia, one of the world's top 20 drugs groups in terms of sales, said
yesterday that underlying operating profits rose 18 per cent to SKr4.43bn
(Dollars 602.2m) in the first nine months of the year.
Cost cutting enabled the group to improve its performance, against
increasing competition and health authority clampdowns which reduced sales
of some of its leading drugs.
Year-on-year comparisons were distorted by one-off gains and the group's
acquisition of the Italian pharmaceuticals company Farmitalia Carlo Erba
(Fice) in May 1993.
Pro-forma figures show underlying sales up 3 per cent at SKr19.87bn and
operating costs down 4.2 per cent at SKr14.84bn. One-off gains of SKr842m
helped lift operating profits to SKr4.43bn, up 61 per cent from last year's
SKr2.74bn. Income after taxes and minority interests was SKr2.66bn.
In the third quarter, operating profits rose to SKr1.66bn from SKr996m.
However, excluding one-off gains of SKr658m, the figure was just SKr12m
higher than a year ago.
Pharmacia, privatised by the Swedish government in June, has mounted a
cost-cutting drive since its Fice purchase. The programme aims to trim
annual costs by SKr1.2bn by 1996 and lift the operating margin to 20 per
cent. In the 12 months to September 30, the margin reached 16.7 per cent,
compared with 14.7 per cent for the full 1993 year.
Sales development has been less successful. Sales of Genotropin, the
company's growth hormone drug, fell 6 per cent over the nine months, to
SKr1.96bn, due to tougher competition in some markets and cost-containment
measures in Spain, Australia and Italy.
Sales of Healon (cataract surgery) were 4 per cent lower at SKr1.18bn after
being hit by tougher competition and lower prices in the US and Japan.
The anti-blood clotting agent Fragmin has been hit by changed reimbursement
rules in Japan. Its sales were 9 per cent lower at SKr592m.
The group's anti-cancer products, Farmorubicin and Adriamycin, showed a
favourable development, with sales rising 13 and 7 per cent respectively.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: CU France set to raise motor
premiums

<TEXT>
The French arm of Commercial Union, one of the UK's biggest composite
insurers, is set to raise motor premiums by up to 10 per cent next spring as
part of an effort to increase profitability, writes Andrew Jack.
Commercial Union France, known as Victoire before it was acquired by the UK
insurer over the summer, also plans to merge its operations in France in an
effort to cut costs.
Commercial Union yesterday reported worldwide pre-tax profits of Pounds 305m
(Dollars 488m) for the first nine months of the year, nearly double the
amount for the same period last year.
CU France reported total premium income up 16 per cent to FFr19.7bn (Dollars
3.7bn) for the first three quarters. Life income rose 20 per cent to
FFr13.1bn and non-life 5 per cent to FFr6.5bn.
Mr Bernard Pottier, director general of Commercial Union Assurances, one of
the main subsidiaries, said he expected motor premiums to rise by between 8
and 10 per cent next April.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Axa may seek listings on leading
exchanges
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, is considering seeking stock
exchange quotations in London, Tokyo and New York over the next two years,
the company said yesterday.
Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, said he was keen to broaden the shareholder base
and obtain listings in other countries where the company has significant
interests.
The operation is also aimed at raising capital to develop operations
overseas.
Axa is already in advanced talks with the New York Stock Exchange over a US
listing. It is in negotiations over the accounting requirements that would
be demanded by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr Bebear said he was also keen to issue shares in the UK and Japan. 'We are
seen as a French company. We want to show that we are becoming more and more
global,' he said.
He would not give details of the size of the potential new share capital,
but said it would make sense for Axa's stock market capitalisations to be
proportionate to the amount of business it did in a given market.
Mr Bebear said he was also in talks about raising between Dollars 100m and
Dollars 200m through other forms of financial instruments next year.
However, he stressed the company had access to facilities of about FFr30bn
(Dollars 5.7bn) if it needed to make quick decisions about potential
acquisitions.
He confirmed the company was seriously evaluating potential acquisitions
overseas, but refused to be more specific.
However, Axa is known to be particularly interested in further expansion in
Europe and Asia.
Axa recently began operating in Japan. It has also opened a representative
office in Beijing and is investing Dollars 10m in a joint venture in Turkey.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa keeps up improvement

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa, the German national airline, continued its much improved
financial performance this year, lifting pre-tax profits by 51 per cent in
the third quarter to DM220m (Dollars 143.79m). The airline said it expected
to break even in the fourth quarter.
For the whole year, it expects to make a profit and pay a dividend for the
first time in five years. Shareholders last received a DM4 payment per share
in 1989.
The company said that in the first nine months, it made a pre-tax profit of
DM325m, compared with a loss of DM76m in the same period of 1993. Group cash
flow would total DM2.2bn this year, it added, with total investments at
DM1.8bn. It gave no comparative figures.
Revenues from flight operations were 8 per cent higher in the first nine
months at DM10.6bn, with total revenues 7.5 per cent higher at nearly
DM12bn.
Passenger numbers were 28.4m, a rise of 4.7 per cent, with sales in terms of
tonne-kilometres 8.8 per cent higher. Cargo business in the nine months rose
by 20 per cent and the overall load factor by 1.8 percentage points to 70.4
per cent.
The airline, which recently signed a partnership deal with Thai Airways
International covering both cargo and passengers, had posted its first
profit for five years in the first half of this year; pre-tax profits
totalled DM105m, against a DM221m loss in the corresponding period of 1993.
Last month, the government yielded control of the airline by not taking up
its entitlement in a rights issue.
The shares were sold to investors in Germany and abroad to raise more than
DM1bn.
It has also decided to spin off its cargo, maintenance and information
technology services into independent profit centres to continue the
streamlining begun several years ago.

<TEXT>
Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate which recently announced a push
into telecommunications, hoisted net profits by 49 per cent to DM677m
(Dollars 442.5m) in the first nine months of this year, up from DM453m.
It was helped by strong sales at PreussenElektra, which is Germany's
second-biggest provider of electricity.
The increase was in line with forecasts, and the company said net profits
for the full year would be 'significantly' higher than last year's DM825m.
Earnings were also bolstered by the sale of coal trading interests at the
Raab Karcher unit, which raised DM132m.
Turnover for the nine months rose 6.6 per cent to DM52.4bn, up from
DM49.1bn. The sharpest rise, of 28.9 per cent, came at PreussenElektra,
which incorporated for the first time the results of five east German
regional generators bought at the beginning of this year.
The company said its troubled chemicals division was making an operating
profit, but there would be a loss for the whole year because of further
restructuring costs of DM180m. Sales rose 1.5 per cent to DM7.6bn.
The results do not include Vebacom, the company's newest division, created
earlier this year. An international partner for Vebacom is expected to be
announced shortly.
Mr Ulrich Hartmann, chief executive, recently announced a planned DM6bn
investment in telecommunications over the next 10 years.

Parkland Group, the woollen yarn and worsted cloth maker, saw pre-tax
profits fall from Pounds 970,000 to Pounds 950,000 in the six months to
September 2, after a difficult second quarter.
However, profits on continuing operations, after taking account of the sale
of its interest in Company Image, improved by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.02m.
Mr Denis Greenwood, chairman, said the second quarter was characterised by
late contracting from many large customers and longer term concerns about
raw material price pressures.
'Although this very demanding trading environment still prevails in many of
our markets, order levels and production have improved substantially in
recent weeks,' he added.
Parkland also announced that it was paying Pounds 110,000 in shares to
acquire Firthmill, a textile importer. In addition, Pounds 40,000 loans to
the vendors will be repaid on completion.
Turnover fell from Pounds 29.3m to Pounds 25.8m, including Pounds 1.35m
(Pounds 3.8m) from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 10.2p
(10.3p) and the interim dividend is held at 2p.

<TEXT>
London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the largest Lloyd's investment
trust, yesterday announced a 15 per cent increase in its underwriting
capacity, alongside its first interim results.
LIMIT's maximum capacity, which is allocated to 101 syndicates managed by 33
agents, rose from Pounds 502.5m to Pounds 580m for 1995, after a valuation
of its funds on August 31.
It is one of 25 new corporate capital groups which underwrite about Pounds
1.6bn of premiums out of Lloyd's total capacity of Pounds 10.9bn.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.97m on investment income of Pounds 5.73m in
the six months to September 30. Under Lloyd's three-year accounting
convention, income for the period does not include results from
underwriting.
Mr Jonathan Agnew, chairman, said underwriting remained favourable this year
with stable premium rates and satisfactory levels of claims.
Earnings per share came out at 1.42p and the board declared an interim
dividend of 1p.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong sales growth and further margin improvement helped Oxford
Instruments, the advanced instrumentation group, report a 54 per cent
increase in interim profits.
The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 5.07m to Pounds 7.81m during the six
months to September 25 on turnover up 13 per cent at Pounds 55.1m (Pounds
48.6m).
Sales in Japan, where the group set up marketing operations in July 1991 and
now employs 35 people, grew strongly and accounted for 10 per cent of the
first-half total, against 6 per cent last time.
Earnings per share increased to 10.4p (6.6p) and the interim dividend is
lifted to 1.7p (1.5p). The shares rose 20p to 329p.
Mr Peter Williams, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'a continuation of
the steady improvement in trading conditions in most of our markets. New
orders have increased consistently over the last 18 months suggesting that a
soundly based recovery may be in prospect.'
Operating profits in the seasonally weaker first half more than doubled to
Pounds 4.02m (Pounds 1.9m) as margins expanded from 4 per cent to 7.3 per
cent.
Mr Williams noted that the analytical systems businesses were now making a
material contribution alongside continuing strong performances from
operations in its core technology of superconductivity - Research
Instruments, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Instruments and Superconducting
Technology. 'In the second half we expect this trend to continue,' he said,
'and in the operations most affected by recession - Plasm Technology and
Medical Systems - there are also encouraging signs of recovery'.
Income from the 49 per cent stake in Oxford Magnetic Technology, the
magnetic resonance imaging joint venture with Siemens, increased to Pounds
3.43m (Pounds 2.81m).
Despite funding additional working capital requirements, the group ended the
period with net cash of Pounds 14.3m, compared with Pounds 7.85m at March.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Packaging helps Porter Chadburn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The completion of its staged withdrawal from consumer products and a sharply
improved showing from packaging operations saw Porter Chadburn swing back
into the black in the first half.
Turnover from continuing operations in the six months to September 30 rose
from Pounds 38.7m to Pounds 42.6m, for operating profits of Pounds 2.17m
(losses of Pounds 62,000), including Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 1.08m) from
packaging as the business benefited from legislative changes in the US
requiring many customers to redesign their labels.
With no exceptionals this time and a reduced interest burden, pre-tax
profits amounted to Pounds 1.62m, against losses last time of Pounds 1.43m
and a deficit of Pounds 17.2m for the full year.
The disposal of the consumer products side - completed in June with the sale
of the Leeda fishing tackle business - coupled with 'stringent' working
capital controls, particularly in the US, helped cut bank borrowings from
Pounds 9.1m at April 1 to Pounds 2.6m. Gearing dropped from 151 per cent to
59 per cent.
Earnings per share were 1.42p (losses of 1.72p), but the interim dividend is
again omitted.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Restructure weighs on Staveley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staveley Industries, the measurement, mechanical engineering and minerals
company, yesterday announced a decline in half-year profits as it continued
to restructure its weighing division.
The company, which also owns British Salt, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 7.5m) on turnover of Pounds 166.3m (Pounds 164.6m) for
the half year to October 1.
The shares dropped 12p to 194p.
Net interest charges jumped 57 per cent to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 700,000).
Gearing rose from 29 per cent to 41 per cent as capital expenditure
increased to Pounds 6.1m (3.7m), mainly on new manufacturing capacity in the
US.
This is part of a Pounds 10m reorganisation package which will transfer
weighing production from California to Minnesota, and end the production of
bagging systems in Germany.
Mr Roy Hitchens, chief executive, said: 'The reorganisation is on plan in
every respect: in terms of time scale, cost reduction, and the construction
of the new facility.'
Turnover from the measuring division fell to Pounds 72.9m (Pounds 77.7m) but
operating profit improved to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.2m). Reorganisation of
the Weigh-Tronix weighing division is expected to finish by the end of the
financial year. Chronos Richardson, the bagging and batch-blending systems
business, is planned to be fully reorganised in 12 months.
The mechanical and electrical services side lifted turnover to Pounds 75m
(Pounds 68.7m) as the maintenance business expanded catering equipment
services. However, pressure on margins in contracting left operating profit
at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 500,000).
The minerals operations, which supply more than half of the UK salt market,
raised turnover slightly to Pounds 17.3m (Pounds 17.1m), after improved
sales of compacted products. Operating profit dipped to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds
6.4m).
Earnings per share fell 6 per cent to 4.6p (4.9p) but the interim dividend
is maintained at 2.3p.

Umeco, the aircraft refueller manufacturer, reported interim pre-tax profits
more than doubled at Pounds 385,000, against Pounds 154,000.
The company said all companies had performed well in the half year to the
end of September with outstanding results from the distribution and aircraft
refuelling divisions.
Turnover was Pounds 9.15m (Pounds 6.01m). Earnings per share came out at
2.39p (1.1p) and the interim dividend is raised to 1p (0.75p).
The company said that in the past second half profits had been substantially
higher than the first. However this year's changed workload would mean a
more even split.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Penna, the USM-quoted outplacement consultants, swung back into the black at
the interim stage as it gained market share in 'continuing highly
competitive' conditions.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 amounted to Pounds
139,000, against losses of Pounds 118,000 last time and Pounds 309,000 for
the previous full year. Turnover expanded by 26 per cent, to Pounds 4.91m;
fee income at Sanders &amp; Sydney improved from Pounds 3.89m to Pounds 4.67m.
'This increase has been achieved in a marketplace in which major competitors
have reported a decline in sales of about 25 per cent,' said Mr John Beard,
chief executive. Marketing initiatives had resulted in a number of new
clients across industry sectors, he added.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.8p (losses of 2p) and the interim dividend
is again 1p.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Sunleigh warns on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunleigh, the leisure products group which made a Pounds 19.2m
diversification into prams last June, yesterday issued a trading statement
suggesting that profits for the second half of 1994 would be 'small', writes
Simon Davies.
The shares fell 1 1/2 p to 4 1/2 p on the announcement that the group had
suffered 'a difficult third quarter', due to a downturn in sales in
continental Europe, particularly for its Laser dinghies and Dart catamarans.
The group also makes Powakaddy motorised golf trolleys, and the purchase of
Maclaren moved it into a third consumer durables sector.
The acquisition was funded by a placing of 320m shares at 6p, resulting in a
fourfold increase in share capital.
Mr Alan Hancock, chief executive, said Maclaren's profits for the third
quarter had exceeded 1993, but that it had a strong seasonal bias towards
the first half. Maclaren has introduced new product lines and substantially
reduced its cost base.
Sunleigh retains a cash surplus of Pounds 650,000, and will pay a nominal
dividend for the second half of the year, its first distribution since 1989.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Coats Viyella lines up buyers - Yarns,
fabrics and carpets attract interest at home and overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, the UK's largest textiles company, has lined up several
buyers for its yarns, fabrics and carpet divisions, in a move expected to
raise more than Pounds 100m for the group.
The shares rose 8 1/2 p to 202 1/2 p on the news, reflecting investors'
surprise that the company had been able to find a single buyer for what
amounts to a mixed bag of relatively unprofitable businesses.
The divisions have net operating assets of Pounds 120m, and employ 5,400
people. However, a number of the businesses are scarcely profitable, and
despite a recently improved performance they achieved operating profits of
just Pounds 6m last year on revenues of Pounds 380m.
The group has had offers for some of the businesses in the past, but it is
understood that these have been at far lower prices. Mr Neville Bain, chief
executive, said: 'We would hope to sell the businesses at close to net asset
value.'
The group was approached by a number of interested parties from both the UK
and overseas. It has narrowed the selection down and is confident that a
deal can be completed during the first quarter of 1995.
Mr Bain was adamant that employment rights of the staff would be 'fully
safeguarded'.
Coats has radically reduced its debt over the past two years. It is expected
to report gearing of about 25 per cent at the end of 1994, compared with 65
per cent in 1992. The disposal would bring the figure below 20 per cent.
Mr Bain said the funds raised from the disposal would leave Coats in a
strong position to expand its core businesses, particularly clothing,
precision engineering and homeware. However, no acquisitions were imminent,
he added.
The disposal is likely to have a neutral impact on the company's profits but
analysts were optimistic that the cash could be channeled into core
businesses that could achieve a far higher return on capital.
Coats' Indian fabrics businesses, which are held by a 51 per cent-owned
subsidiary, are to be retained by the group.
Baring Brothers have been appointed to advise on the disposals.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Old City ties fray as new advisers muscle
in - Nicholas Denton examines a changing relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A listing in the Crawford's directory of City connections is not what it
used to be. SG Warburg and Baring Brothers are recorded therein as financial
advisers to drinks company Allied Domecq. But it was Goldman Sachs, the US
corporate adviser, that planned Allied's Pounds 265m sale of its food
ingredient business announced this week.
The instance is no isolated one. Goldman has encroached on another
traditional Warburg client by advising Reckitt &amp; Colman on the disposal of
the Colman mustard line.
The coincidence of the two cases, aside from reflecting well on Goldman
Sachs, illustrates a broader point: ancient ties between company and
merchant bank in the UK are fraying. One UK corporate financier says: 'I
don't really care what goes on in Crawford's. It's rather archaic.'
Investment banking does, as its practitioners are fond of saying, remain a
'relationship business' and old ties count. Reckitt used Warburg for its
recent acquisition in the US. The UK house is also handling the disposal of
Allied's beverage and bakery businesses.
A long-standing relationship remains particularly relevant when a company
mandates an adviser to conduct a rights issue or some other core
transaction. 'A Crawford's relationship means a lot,' says Mr Mark Nicholls,
joint head of corporate finance at Warburg.
But even Warburg, bank of record to more UK-quoted companies than any other
adviser, knows the limitations of tradition. 'Crawford's does not mean that
you win every bit of business from that client,' says Mr Nicholls. 'All it
means is that you have an open door.'
Clients are spreading their business around more promiscuously than they
used to. 'The big international companies like to have two or three strings
to their bow,' says a UK M&amp;A specialist.
Financial advisers are adapting to the wishes of their customers. Some, such
as Morgan Stanley, even make a virtue of their willingness to act as joint
adviser. UK banks have mellowed enormously since the 1980s, when some would
threaten to resign rather than accept an interloper as joint adviser on a
transaction.
Sharing out favours can be a way to smooth the transition from one adviser
to another. 'A merchant bank is like wallpaper,' says a US M&amp;A specialist.
'You are not going to redecorate the room in one transaction.'
Another US investment banker says that a UK client will save face for its
traditional merchant bank by giving it a token role. 'There are times when
the co-adviser is there for relationship purposes. We say that as long as
they stay out of our way everything will be fine.'
However, the UK-listed companies that have gone the whole hog, and formally
named US houses as their bankers of record, are few and vanishing. Goldman
Sachs, listed as Racal Electronics' adviser, is hard pressed to come up with
further names.
The more general pattern is for large UK companies, such as Allied, to
retain a UK adviser while also building a relationship with a US investment
bank.
UK and US banks' skills can complement each other. A US investment banker
says that his company brings industry knowledge, advanced techniques and an
international perspective; but he concedes that the traditional UK merchant
bank has 'history' and a knowledge of the board.
What is more, a pool of advisers can provide useful options for a company
when one is 'conflicted out' - forced to turn down a client's business
because it is acting on behalf of a competitor.
Above all, it is UK companies' acquisition forays into the US or continental
European market that have often provided the opportunity for interlopers.
Goldman's seduction of Reckitt illustrates the classic scenario: a US
investment bank advising on a purchase in the US, getting its foot in
management's door and pitching for later business.
'Relationships are important but you cannot rest on your laurels and expect
the business to come to you,' says Mr Will Samuel, head of corporate finance
at Schroders, the UK merchant bank.
But established advisers are also becoming better at facilitating the
international ambitions of their clients. Warburg has as many corporate
finance employees in New York today as it had in London in the early 1980s.
A decade ago an acquisition in the US would have been handled by a local
bank. But in the last month Warburg escorted three UK companies into the US
in deals worth Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.07bn). Or perhaps Warburg chaperoned
them: at least these three will not be meeting any new banks.
But investment banks can also seduce from the other side of the table.
Goldman made contact with Allied through advising Domecq of Spain, its
target earlier this year.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals help Orb to Pounds 13.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Orb Estates, the commercial property developer, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 13.8m for the year to June 30, compared with a restated loss last
time of Pounds 38.3m.
The company had returned to the black at the interim stage, with a profit
before tax of Pounds 8.23m.
The full-year result came on the back of turnover down 14 per cent at Pounds
11.3m (Pounds 13.1m). The board said profits were almost entirely made up of
exceptional items, including Pounds 14.5m credited in respect of the
company's capital reconstruction, as well as a Pounds 626,000 profit on the
sale of investment properties. Last year's figure included a Pounds 20.2m
write-off.
Operating profits were Pounds 2.92m, against losses of Pounds 3.6m after
losses at discontinued operations of Pounds 4.05m. Earnings per share were
1.98p (41.8p losses), taking into account the reconstruction and the share
issue in January.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cookson makes Pounds 10m German acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, yesterday aimed to
strengthen electronics operations in continental Europe by taking full
control of Alpha Grillo, its German joint venture.
Cookson paid Pounds 10.4m to buy the remaining 50 per cent of Alpha Grillo,
which is the leading German producer of solders and fluxes, from the
Metallgesellschaft subsidiary Grillo Werke.
Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said: 'By gaining full operational
control of Alpha Grillo, we are able to capitalise more effectively on the
potential that exists within the German and eastern European markets.'
Alpha Grillo would provide Alpha Fry with an important springboard for
expansion into developing markets such as Poland, the Czech Republic and
Russia, he added.
Alpha Fry forms part of the group's electronics materials side, which
contributed 33 per cent of Cookson's Pounds 111m operating profit last year.
It is now expected to help improve product development and distribution at
the German company.
The acquisition, which is to be funded from existing facilities, follows a
joint venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply central and
eastern Europe with special refractories and systems used in the steel
continuous casting process.
It also forms part of a strategy of withdrawing from non-core businesses,
which led to the disposal of 25 engineering subsidiaries in March.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL chairman urges quick OFT bid decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Chalfont, chairman of VSEL, the submarine maker coveted by BAe and GEC,
yesterday urged the government to make a quick decision on whether to allow
the takeovers to proceed.
Bids from both companies are currently being examined by the Office of Fair
Trading to determine whether they raise competition worries.
Lord Chalfont has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, asking them to make
their recommendations to the OFT quickly so that shareholders and employees
can be clear where they stand. The government said a decision would be
reached as soon as possible.
The impatience at VSEL came as the OFT indicated that it would not now rule
on BAe's bid by November 16, but had extended the deadline to December 7. A
decision on whether or not to refer either bid to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is now expected in the first week of December.
About 150 shareholders attended an extraordinary meeting at 7pm on Wednesday
evening at the Vickers sports and social club in Barrow. The meeting voted
to amend VSEL's articles to allow BAe to buy more than 15 per cent of the
shares. An EGM to approve a similar waiver for GEC is to be held on November
24.
VSEL workers are concerned about the prospect of being taken over by either
company. The few worker-shareholders who remain, however, are keen to see
the takeover race proceed rapidly to secure the highest price possible for
their shares.
While the amendment to the articles will allow either company to take over
VSEL, neither BAe nor GEC can buy more than 15 per cent of its shares in the
market until they have an acceptance of their bid by a majority of
shareholders.
GEC already owns 15 per cent and therefore cannot increase its stake until
it has acceptances from another 35 per cent of VSEL's shareholders. BAe has
no VSEL shares and cannot currently buy in the market as VSEL's shares are
well above the cash alternative to its all-share offer.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance at Pounds 311m despite
premium income drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total premium income at Royal Insurance fell to Pounds 3.56bn in the first
nine months of this year, compared with Pounds 3.76bn. Royal said, however,
that the drop largely reflected a planned reduction in its reinsurance
operation, writes Ralph Atkins.
The amount of personal motor premiums written fell by 5 per cent in the nine
months to Pounds 239m. Within that total, Royal said The Insurance Service,
its direct-selling operation, was taking an increasing share of business.
The group's pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 113m to Pounds 311m.
The UK-based life operation achieved a 5 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 39m, but the overseas life operations dropped by Pounds
2m. Overall UK operating profits jumped to Pounds 276m against Pounds 79m,
helped by good weather conditions and fewer claims.
Royal's chain of 481 estate agents made an increased loss of Pounds 11m
against Pounds 7m, partly from refurbishment costs.
US operations also lost money, not helped by a high level of weather and
catastrophe-related claims. But Royal expressed confidence in a recovery
ahead, noting that the second and third quarters had seen some improvement
in underwriting results compared with a year earlier.
Adding to the spread of its business, Royal said it had struck commercial
agreements with German and Scandinavian insurance companies which had
increased its access to markets in those countries.
The group's capital and reserves decreased to Pounds 1.94bn at September 30,
compared with Pounds 2.2bn at the end of 1993 as a result of falls in world
equity and bond markets. Total investment income fell to Pounds 359m from
Pounds 380m owing to the effect of lower interest rates and the move in
asset allocation towards equities.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery helps Burton to Pounds 41m -
Debenhams rises but losses at Principles, Top Shops and men's wear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Burton, the clothing retail group including Debenhams, Burtons and Dorothy
Perkins, more than doubled profits last year despite falling into the red in
its multiples division.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 41.1m in the 53 weeks to September 3, up from
Pounds 16.3m in 1992-93 when there was an exceptional loss of Pounds 19.6m.
Total sales edged ahead from Pounds 1.89bn to Pounds 1.91bn.
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said the group's plans for recovery were
moving along the right track, although all was not behaving exactly as he
would have liked.
The strategy of rebuilding the brands had led to better sales and margins
throughout the group in the second half, with the exception of Burtons.
The men's wear chain reported an operating loss of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 6.4m
profit) on sales down 5.5 per cent to Pounds 263m (Pounds 278.3m). Sales
fell 19 per cent, although 7 percentage points of the decline were accounted
for by the decision earlier this year to contract out its business in men's
suits.
Mr Hoerner said the group had reduced the amount of sales promotions at
Burtons and had cut stocks, but he was 'not expecting any great things this
season'.
Losses at Principles rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 19.4m on lower sales
of Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 120.4m), although the figures reflect a fall in the
number of outlets. While losses at Top Shop/Top Man increased to Pounds 7.2m
(Pounds 5.1m), sales edged ahead to Pounds 216.9m (Pounds 212.9m), and the
second half was just in the black.
Dorothy Perkins and Evans both increased operating profits, to Pounds 11.4m
(Pounds 10m) and Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 10.9m) respectively.
In the first nine weeks of the current year the multiples had operated
without staging sales for 90 per cent of the time, compared with only 30 per
cent last year.
This had resulted in an improvement of 5 percentage points in the gross
margin, although the group stressed that this was not sustainable throughout
the first half.
Operating profits at Debenhams rose from Pounds 57.7m to Pounds 71.5m on
sales ahead from Pounds 854.4m to Pounds 910.4m.
Net interest payable fell from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 17.7m, and net debt at
the end of the year was Pounds 77m, down from Pounds 212m. This was mainly
as a result of the sale in May of four shopping centres for Pounds 153m, a
deal that ended the group's foray into the property business.
Earnings per share were 2.1p (0.9p). A final dividend of 1p is proposed,
giving an unchanged 2p for the year.
COMMENT
The name of the game is to get the multiples back in profit, particularly
Burtons and Principles which between them lost Pounds 32m - a sum not far
short of the group's total profit. Stabilising margins and re-establishing
price integrity without losing sales is not easy, but early indications for
the current year suggest the group has taken the right approach. At
Principles, sales in the early weeks are nearly 7 per cent higher and 59 of
the badly performing stores have been taken out of the division. A quick
turnround will follow if the strategy is successful. This is reflected in
the share price, which rose 7 1/2 p to 71p yesterday. Forecast profits this
year of Pounds 65m put the group on a prospective multiple of more than 20,
a premium to the sector - but perhaps still attractive to the optimists.

FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: IPounds 7m loan recovery helps
Bank of Ireland rise 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected recovery of a IPounds 7m individual loan that had been written
off helped pre-tax profits at Bank of Ireland rise by 28 per cent from
IPounds 130.9m to IPounds 167.3m (Pounds 164.3m) in the six months to
September 30.
The bank disclosed that competition for deposits in Ireland had narrowed its
net interest margin from 4.3 per cent to 4.1 per cent, although the effect
on income was offset by loan growth, including a strong rise in mortgages.
It raised its interim dividend by 13 per cent to 4.25p (3.75p), emphasising
that this was 'in order to achieve a better balance' with the final.
Earnings per share rose from 15.2p to 22p, and net asset value per share
grew from 144p to 174p.
Mr Maurice Keane, deputy chief executive, said it might repay some
subordinated loan capital from next year onwards as retained earnings
strengthened capital, but had no plans to distribute cash to shareholders in
a share buy-back.
Mr Keane said the bank was more likely to use the cash for acquisitions. He
said this could include the purchase of a mortgage portfolio in the UK, or
an expansion of life insurance or pensions in Ireland.
He expected margin pressures to continue, and said that they could extend
from deposits to lending if National Australia Bank or National Westminster
Bank succeeded in buying TSB Bank, creating a larger competitor.
The First New Hampshire group, its US retail arm, returned a IPounds 13.9m
profit (IPounds 3.5m loss). Mr Keane said the subsidiary would be retained
for at least two years in order to gain the tax benefit of accumulated
losses.
Loan loss provisions as a percentage of loans fell to what Mr Keane said was
an 'unsustainably low' level of 0.2 per cent as a result of loan recoveries
of IPounds 10.6m, including the unidentified individual recovery of about
IPounds 7m.
Net interest income fell slightly to IPounds 304.9m (IPounds 311.2m) as a
result of narrowing margins, but loan loss provisions fell to IPounds 11.4m
(IPounds 47.5m). Operating expenses slipped by 1 per cent from IPounds
288.7m to IPounds 285.2m as staff costs fell.
The shares closed unchanged at 285p.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fears of potential Campari bid allayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that a potential bidder might be moving in on Campari International,
the company which designs and markets leisurewear and sportswear, were
allayed yesterday. The buyer of an 11 per cent stake was revealed as a
private investor.
It was announced on Wednesday that a company called Blueridge had acquired
1.12m shares, representing 10.73 per cent of Campari.
Campari was unaware of what Blueridge was and what its intention might be.
The textiles group appeared vulnerable because its share price had fallen by
a third to 24p at the end of October following the announcement of Pounds
3.7m rationalisation costs to combat difficult trading conditions.
It transpires that Blueridge is the private investment vehicle of Mr Paul
Thompson, the chairman of Sanderson Electronics, a Sheffield-based computer
support company. In October, Sanderson was on the acquisition trail, taking
a controlling interest in SGA Pac-ific from General Automation.
However, Mr Thompson said yesterday that Blueridge was his personal
investment vehicle, there was no synergy between his company and Campari and
he had no predatory intentions. 'I just thought the shares were cheap
despite the fact that the company is not enjoying the best of times at the
moment.'
Mr Rob Wilkinson, Campari's company secretary, said: 'Obviously we were keen
to find out what Mr Thompson's intentions were. We have spoken to him and he
has indicated that the stake is purely for investment purposes.'
The shares gained 2p to close at 27p yesterday.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification
System
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following a partial review of the Financials Economic Group of the Industry
Classification System, the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee
has agreed to refine and update the current system to reflect the changing
nature of many companies currently classified in these sectors. The
following improvements will be implemented on December 31 1994:
Banking Sectors - The two current banking sectors are to be renamed Banks,
Retail and Banks, Merchant and redefined. This will provide a clearer
distinction between retail and merchant banks.
Fund Managers &amp; Stockbrokers - A new sub-sector within the Other Financial
industry sector will be introduced, drawing together all fund managers and
stockbrokers into one distinct sub-sector.
Discount houses - This sub-sector will be discontinued and the companies
previously classified as discount houses classified elsewhere.
Investment Trusts - The Investment Trusts sector had grown very large and
included a variety of different trusts. Consequently, the Classification
Committee, working in conjunction with the Association of Investment Trust
Companies, have divided the old Investment Trusts sector into six new
sub-sectors: UK General, European, International, Geographic Specialists,
Venture &amp; Development Capital, and Split Capital Funds.
'The business world is constantly changing and these on-going improvements
to the Industry Classification System help to ensure that it is always
up-to-date and relevant', commented Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, chairman of the
FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee.
'The Investment Trust sector had grown as new trusts were launched and
dividing it into six new sub-sectors will result in more homogenous
groupings. I'm sure that this and our improvements to the definition and
segmentation of the bank and financial sectors will be welcomed by
investors'.
Details of the changes to individual stocks will be published after the next
meeting of the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee on December
5 1994.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Wellington launch postponed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The planned launch of Wellington Underwriting as a listed company investing
in Lloyd's of London has been postponed following the insurance market's
failure to agree new rules on corporate capital, writes Ralph Atkins.
The company said it was now proposing an impact day in the middle of next
week instead of today.
Wellington had intended to place 30m shares at 100p and use the capital to
invest in seven Lloyd's syndicates run by the Wellington managing agency. It
hoped to attract money from existing corporate investors at Lloyd's, but
this depended on Lloyd's approving new rules on corporate vehicles investing
in each other.
Wellington has decided to go ahead without the new rules.

Drayton English &amp; International Trust, which seeks capital growth through a

decline in net asset value during the six months to October 5.
The figure of 102.6p per share at the period end compared with 105.7p at the

same period.
Net revenue was Pounds 768,000, compared with Pounds 825,000 in the first
half last year.
Earnings per share fell to 0.17p (0.3p) but the interim dividend is

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat under fire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders in Queens Moat Houses yesterday accused the heavily
indebted hotels group of breaching company law by not calling an annual
meeting within the required time.
Mr Dennis Woodhams of the QMH Shareholders Action Group said failure to call
the AGM could mean there is at least one director 'not properly a director
of the company'.
'All directors have been appointed by the board itself since the 1992 AGM,
which was the last one validly to elect or re-elect directors,' he said.
'Consequently there is no director who has been elected by shareholders.'
Queens Moat rejected Mr Woodhams' suggestions that it had breached company
law: 'We are happy to reassure Mr Woodhams that the timing of the AGM is
perfectly in order and it will be held before the end of this year.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent rises to Pounds 246m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A fall of almost Pounds 50m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts helped
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, report a 32 per
cent increase in pre-tax profit for the year to the end of September, taking
it from Pounds 186.2m to Pounds 245.8m.
The drop in provisions - from Pounds 131.1m to Pounds 82.2m - also assisted
Leeds Permanent's net interest income, which rose to Pounds 458.4m (Pounds
425.8m), through a reduced charge for irrecoverable interest.
Non-interest income was flat at Pounds 104.6m (Pounds 104.2m), although a
further Pounds 9.1m was set aside as statutory reserves for the life
insurance subsidiary which became operational in July.
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, said the society - which has been without a chief
executive for more than 18 months - was now closer to making an appointment
than it had been six months ago, and that a statement would be made in 'a
matter of weeks rather than months'.
It seems unlikely, however, that a new chief executive will be appointed
before the end of the year.
Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said that against the background of a
relatively flat mortgage market, he saw prospects for growth coming from
non-core areas such as sales of life insurance and unit trusts.
It would be important, he said, both to ensure that the organisation's
infrastructure could deliver service at a low cost and to develop new areas
of business.
However, the society had no immediate plans to take advantage of the greater
powers which had been proposed by the government to set up a wholly-owned
general insurance business.
Leeds' recurring administrative expenses rose by a little less than 4 per
cent to Pounds 226.1m, and costs of a further Pounds 22.6m were incurred in
a voluntary redundancy programme. Total assets rose slightly to Pounds
20.6bn (Pounds 19.5bn).
Mr Boyes said that Leeds Property, the society's estate agency, had reported
profits of Pounds 360,000. He admitted that these were modest and said that
over the last few years it had delivered much less mortgage business to the
society than had been hoped.
The society was fully committed to the estate agency, he said, but 'all
parts of the business are constantly under review'.

The announcement follows better than expected pay-outs from Thames and
Anglian, which increased dividends by 11 and 10 per cent.
Mr David Cranston, chief executive, said Northumbrian intended to bring its
cover down from about 4 times to 2.5 by the end of the decade. This would
happen within a pricing regime which was 'tough, but achievable', he said.
He sought to fend off potential criticism by saying the increase represented
on average about 15p per customer, or Pounds 400,000 in total. This compared
with the Pounds 1m which Northumbrian expected to contribute this year to a
new regional fund it had set up to encourage economic regeneration in the
area.
Analysts, however, described the action as maverick. The company had been
expected to offer a higher than average increase, but 16 per cent was
unprecedented, said one.
Pre-tax profits for the first half more than doubled from Pounds 22.6m to
Pounds 46.1m on sales 5.4 per cent ahead at Pounds 155.7m (Pounds 144.7m).
Earnings rose from 30.3p to 59.1p.
The sharp profits increase was largely due to the absence of Pounds 8.9m in
exceptional charges for the closure of a pipe maintenance business and a
Pounds 2.2m loss on discontinued operations. At the operating level profits
rose by 43 per cent from Pounds 41m to Pounds 55.5m, including Pounds 1.5m
from acquisitions.
In the regulated water and sewerage business, operating margins rose from 38
to 47 per cent. This was largely due to a 4 per cent reduction in operating
costs.
The non-regulated environmental services business increased losses to Pounds
1.5m (Pounds 900,000). However, Northumbrian expected the business to return
to profit in the second half.
COMMENT
rate for utilities put a dampener on water shares yesterday. Yet
Northumbrian's bold move should reinforce the view that other water
companies are likely to rethink dividend policies. The most obvious
candidates for higher increases are Southern, Severn Trent and Welsh,
although none of them is likely to come near Northumbrian's figure.
Meanwhile, the company's immediate prospects are encouraging. It should beat
efficiency targets, which have been set by the regulator, and is also
expected to increase the final dividend by 16 per cent. However, a higher
tax charge might mean a more modest increase next year. Forecasts are for
about Pounds 83m this year, before exceptionals. With the shares rising 16p
to 712p the prospective p/e of 6 and its dividend prospects make
Northumbrian stand out, although the water sector labours under substantial
political risk.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward downturn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Appleby Westward Group, the grocery distributor, dropped
from Pounds 730,000 to Pounds 146,000 for the 28 weeks to September 10. The
result included Pounds 90,000 profit on the disposal of the USM-quoted
company's commercial vehicle repair business.
Although turnover improved from Pounds 38.2m to Pounds 45.1m, operating
profits tumbled from Pounds 707,000 to Pounds 62,000.
The reduction in profit was largely because of a Pounds 520,000 sub-contract
commission payment, the company said, as well as a small decline in gross
margins in the core food distribution business. The shopfitting operation
incurred a small loss.
Mr Roger Harvey, chairman, said Appleby had decided to meet competition by
increasing its company-owned and operated stores.
Earnings per share were down to 1.7p (8.5p). However, the 3.2p interim
dividend is maintained.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sotheby's back in the black after nine
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sotheby's Holdings, the parent company of Sotheby's, the New York-based
auction, finance and real estate operation, returned to the black at the
nine-month stage, reflecting a broad-based improvement across the art
market.
For the nine months to the end of September, income was Dollars 2.5m (Pounds
1.52m) against a loss of Dollars 1.3m. Net income per share was 4 cents
(losses of 2 cents).
Auction sales grew from Dollars 719.9m to Dollars 797.2m in the nine months,
and from Dollars 84.7m to Dollars 105.2m in the third quarter, traditionally
a slow period in the art market. The improvement followed the UK Old Master
Paintings auction in July and several single-owner sales, including the
country house sale of Crossrigg Hall.
The group reduced its third quarter loss from Dollars 12.7m (23 cents per
share) to Dollars 11.5m (21 cents per share).
Ms Diana Brooks, president and chief executive, said combined sales in all
collecting categories except Impressionist and Modern Art and Jewellery were
up 22 per cent. Sales of Impressionist and Modern Art and Jewellery were
ahead of the 1992 low, but still below last year's levels.
'We anticipate, therefore, that the decline in the performance of these two
categories, coupled with several strong non-recurring sales held in 1993,
will result in lower fourth quarter auction sales,' she said.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Warner Howard ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Warner Howard, which rents and distributes laundry and catering equipment,
reported a 7.2 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.22m to
Pounds 3.46m in the six months to August 31.
Although investment in new equipment in its markets continued to be slow,
the company said there had been progress in rentals and its new niche
markets.
Mr Ronald Hooker, chairman, said that the continued strength of the balance
sheet enabled Warner to pursue further expansion and several possible
acquisitions were under review.
Cash flow was positive and period-end gearing was nil.
Turnover advanced from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 11.1m, a rise of 4 per cent.
Earnings per share were 9.76p (9.11p). The interim dividend is raised to
2.8p (2.27p) partly to reduce disparity between the interim and final
payments and partly to reflect the company's growing cash generation and
liquidity.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods ready to put itself up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the UK waste services group, is today expected to promise
shareholders it will put itself up for sale if investors reject the hostile
Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US.
The company is likely to present shareholders with a series of alternatives
to the BFI bid, which it believes will give investors more value than the
hostile 109p offer. The options are thought to range from asset disposals to
a promise to put Attwoods on the block if the bid fails.
'We have got to put forward concrete proposals,' said a company adviser.
'Investors have to believe we will deliver that value.'
Today is the last day under the UK takeover code that Attwoods can publish
any new financial information. Yesterday, the company geared up for its
final defence with a widely expected document showing an improvement in the
first quarter.
Operating profits rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 15.4m, on sales 10 per cent
higher at Dollars 151.3m for the three months to October 31. In sterling
terms, operating profits were 2 per cent higher at Pounds 9.8m, on sales 5
per cent ahead to Pounds 96.7m. 'The profit estimate supports our recent
comments on the outlook for 1995 as a whole,' Attwoods said.
Attwoods also published an independent valuation of its UK property assets,
which it said 'demonstrated the inadequacy of BFI's offer'. Chartered
surveyors Grimley JR Eve revalued the UK assets upwards by Pounds 33m to
Pounds 130.6m. 'BFI's bid takes no account of the underlying value of the UK
assets,' Attwoods said. On both earnings and sales multiples, BFI's offer
undervalued Attwoods, the company said.
BFI attacked the profits figures as 'dismal'. 'The operating profit increase
is less than we were anticipating,' said Mr Philip Angell of BFI. 'We had
expected something closer to double digit growth.'
Furthermore, operating margins had fallen and Attwoods had underperformed in
the first quarter compared with other waste companies which showed on
average 54 per cent growth. 'Attwoods shareholders should not take any
comfort from these numbers,' said Mr Angell.
The bidder said it would send shareholders a more detailed response
following Attwoods' final document tomorrow. BFI has until November 18 to
increase its offer.
Attwoods is being advised by Robert Fleming, SG Warburg, and Smith Barney.
CS First Boston are BFI's advisers.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: ScottishPower signs joint National Grid
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ScottishPower said yesterday that together with Scottish Hydro-Electric it
had signed an agreement with the National Grid to increase the capacity of
the England-Scotland interconnector by more than a third.
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said the interconnector increase from
1,600MW to 2,200MW would mean that the company could export 'well over 30
per cent' of the electricity it produced from 1997, when the improved
facility is operating fully.
The announcement accompanied a 6 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 122.9m.
The interim dividend is raised 10.2 per cent to 4.55p, payable from earnings
per share in the six months to September 30 of 11.01p, a 2 per cent
improvement.
Earnings were depressed by an increase in the tax charge from 24 to 27 per
cent. This compares with 26 per cent for the whole of last year. Turnover
rose 9.6 per cent to Pounds 733m.
Mr Preston said there were no plans to implement a share buy-back programme.
'We are not short of good opportunities to invest funds and enhance
shareholder value,' he said, citing the company's telecommunications,
retailing and gas interests as examples.
Asked if the company was considering takeovers or mergers with regional
power companies in England and Wales Mr Preston said: 'We have ruled nothing
out'.
A reduction of 300 in core staff levels to 5,500 held employee costs at
Pounds 75m (Pounds 74m).
Retailing profits fell from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 1.8m following the
acquisition of 50 Clydesdale stores which it has been refurbishing. The
company said the stores were back in service and exceeding expectations. It
expects to better last year's retail profits of Pounds 7.4m.
Debt amounted to Pounds 18m, with gearing of 1.8 per cent. Mr Ian Russell,
finance director, said he expected gearing to be close to double figures by
the year-end.
COMMENT
ScottishPower's problem is that, like Scottish Hydro-Electric, it is more
tightly regulated than companies south of the border and its ability to
outshine them in profit or dividend growth is constrained. It is seeking to
distinguish itself by building shareholder value, rather than distributing
it through share buybacks and one-off dividends. Laudable though
diversification into 'utility-related' business may be, it has yet to prove
itself: annual retailing profits will be closely scrutinised.
ScottishPower's advantages include the expanded interconnector, which could
have a significant effect on profits, and the fact that it has less to fear
from a Labour government penalising over-profitable utilities. The shares
are trading on a prospective yield of 4.8 per cent, assuming a full-year
dividend of 13.65p, and are fairly rated.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke plans to reduce staff in
reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke is to reduce its head office and central services staff by more
than half in a reorganisation which will be completed by the end of this
year.
The hotels, betting and retailing group said the number of head office and
central administrative staff would be cut from 280 to 120. Not all of the
employees affected would be made redundant as some will be moved into
Ladbroke's divisions.
Members of the head office legal department will be moved into the group's
individual businesses. Posts which will be eliminated completely, however,
include 85 jobs at a group distribution depot in Barnsley.
Ladbroke said profits in the three months to the end of September were ahead
of the same period last year and recovered the first half shortfall -
pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 57.3m after
exceptional items, compared with Pounds 62.5m.
Hotels in the UK, particularly in London, showed increases in both occupancy
and room rate. Hotel performance in continental Europe and Japan, however,
was below last year's level and significant recovery would not be apparent
until 1995. Hilton's performance overall was slightly below that of the
corresponding period last year, the group said.
Retail betting in the UK was hampered by dry summer weather and hard ground,
but had since recovered. Credit betting in the third quarter was lower than
in the second, although Ladbroke described results as 'satisfactory'. The
Vernons pools business performed well.
Sales at Texas Homecare were slightly down on a like-for-like basis, but
margins improved following measures taken in the first half.
The shares rose 1p to close at 154p.

FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BSkyB to publish pathfinder on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture is pushing ahead
with a December flotation in London and New York, expected to value the
company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn.
The offer of some 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital will be launched
with a pathfinder prospectus on Monday.
The value of the offer is in the middle of expectations. Some estimates put
a potential valuation of more than Pounds 5bn on the company, formed out of
a merger between Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting.
The closing of the offer is expected in the week beginning December 5, which
means the float will come about a week after shares of TeleWest, the UK's
largest cable operator, start to trade in both London and on the Nasdaq
market in New York.
The main shareholders in BSkyB are Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation,
Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, Granada, the
television and leisure group, and Chargeurs, the French industrial company.
In addition to the institutional offer, 12 firms were named yesterday as
providing share shops for the retail offer of shares.
As BSkyB moves towards flotation, designed mainly to reduce debt, the
satellite company is believed to be signing up new subscribers through both
cable networks and direct to the home at the rate of about 60,000 a month.
BSkyB is also thought to be on the verge of signing a deal with SES of
Luxembourg. SES operates the Astra satellite system for five more 24-hour
channels, which will be used to provide further services. One part of the
extra capacity will enable experimentation with pay-per-view services,
particularly for recent films.
The London listing is being co-sponsored by Goldman Sachs and Lazard
Brothers.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Royal to shed staff despite tripled profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday forecast a 10 per cent
reduction in its UK workforce over the next three years, in spite of a near
tripling of pre-tax profits in the first nine months to Pounds 311m.
Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, said competitive pressures and the scope
offered by technology for cutting costs were forcing a reappraisal of
manpower levels across the group's operations. Jobs would be lost through
natural wastage.
Though the group's results underlined the strength of Royal's recovery from
heavy losses in the early 1990s, Mr Gamble acknowledged that the group had
benefited from exceptionally good trading conditions, particularly on
claims.
Reflecting its increase in pre-tax profits, up from Pounds 113m last time,
Royal also announced a switch in its investment strategy away from
fixed-interest securities. It invested an extra Pounds 250m in equities in
the nine-month period with the objective of boosting long-term capital
growth, rather than income.
Royal's results followed similarly buoyant figures earlier this week from
Commercial Union but neither have assuaged fears that the insurance industry
is entering a phase of intense pressure on margins over the next few years.
Highlighting the pressure on premium prices, Royal estimated private motor
rates had fallen by 5 per cent over the past year. Household policy rates
have also fallen in the past 12 months, while Royal estimates growth in
rates for commercial lines has slowed considerably.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Oil groups jump into deep water: A report on the development
of new fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oil companies are keen followers of fashion. As soon as one makes a
significant discovery in a promising new area, others pile in.
At least that was the hope of the UK government, which earlier this week
gave the go-ahead for the development of Foinaven, the UK's first oil field
in the deep waters west of the Shetland Islands.
British Petroleum has estimated total reserves at Foinaven of 250m-500m
barrels of oil, placing it in the upper range of recent North Sea
discoveries. But the field is much smaller than the multi-billion barrel
fields such as Forties and Brent discovered in the early stages of North Sea
exploration.
For the UK, however, Foinaven promises to open up a new frontier oil
province of perhaps 3.5bn-4bn barrels of oil, placing it in the 'world
class' category.
It would also be sufficient, according to Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy
minister, to extend the UK's status as a major international oil producer
well into the next century.
But Foinaven's significance extends beyond the UK. It is further evidence
that oil companies are increasingly confident that they can find and produce
oil in water depths and conditions which just a few years ago would have
been judged too risky and beyond their technical competence.
'Five years ago if I told you that we would be producing oil in 3,000 ft of
water, as the Brazilians are doing, you'd have said I was nuts,' says Mr
Robert Esser, who monitors oil development projects for Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, a Massachusetts-based consultancy.
The speed with which deep water developments are taking place is mainly due
to technological advances. New seismic techniques enable geologists to 'see'
potential fields better. Advanced drilling methods allow wells to have
lengthy horizontal sections within the actual reservoir, so more oil can be
recovered and fewer wells need to be drilled, a big factor when individual
wells can cost Dollars 10m-Dollars 15m (Pounds 9m).
BP expects first oil from Foinaven only three and a half years after its
discovery, compared with five to 10 years for most projects.
Growing deep water experience promises further big gains in efficiency and
cost savings. US oil companies have joined together in the Deep Star
programme to develop deep water technology. Other savings are being realised
through design improvements, such as Shell's floating platform at its new
Auger field in 2,860 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico which contains 39,000
tons of steel. Refinements mean that the nearby Mars platform being
installed in 2,933 ft of water will contain 8,000 fewer tons of steel. Mars'
planned output of 100,000 b/d will be double that Auger, but it will cost
Dollars 200m less.
Such savings have helped to slash finding and development costs per barrel,
which in Foinaven's case is down to Dollars 4-Dollars 5. That makes such
developments economically feasible even when crude oil prices are at low
levels, such as the current Dollars 15-Dollars 18 a barrel range.
Given the prospect that costs for new projects will fall even further, the
enthusiasm for deep water projects is likely to grow.
Some of the most promising deep water oil regions, such as the west of
Shetlands and the Gulf of Mexico, are close to offshore oil provinces that
are already producing. Companies have ready and cheap access to shore
terminals and undersea pipelines which can often be easily extended to the
frontier areas.
But could the deep water projects influence world crude oil prices in coming
years? Some analysts think they will.
They note that apart from the UK and US, many of the most exciting deep
water prospects are in Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia, the Philippines, Angola and
Namibia. With the exception of Nigeria, they are outside the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and therefore not subject to Opec production
quotas.
Other analysts note that even relatively small changes in oil output in key
countries such as the US or the UK can have a far-reaching effect on prices.
This is because of the central price-setting role performed by benchmark
crudes such as Brent Blend.
The sharp rise in non-Opec production, and particularly North Sea output
over the past year has clearly confounded current Opec attempts to boost
prices.
Mr Mehdi Varzi of London brokers Kleinwort Benson says there is a
possibility that oil markets and Opec will continue to underestimate
non-Opec production over the next few years.
That view is echoed by Mr John Toalster of London brokers Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull. 'The North Sea is the current bete noire of Opec,' he
says.
There is now a possibility that Foinaven and the other fields west of
Shetlands could assume that mantle in future.

FT  11 NOV 94 / BT pays the price of job and cost cuts: Chairman warns on
outlook for the annual results as shares ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of cutting prices and jobs held back revenues and profitability at
British Telecommunications in the first six months of the year.
Sir Iain Vallance, chairman, warned that the second-half results would be
affected by the same factors, influencing a 5p fall in the share price to
388p.
Despite a stronger UK economy which helped to push up inland call volumes by
more than 7 per cent, profits before tax were Pounds 1.49bn, slightly below
the Pounds 1.5bn recorded last time. Turnover rose to Pounds 6.85bn compared
with Pounds 6.76bn. Earnings per share fell from 15.6p to 15p.
Sir Iain said the group's underlying performance was strong, arguing that
after adjustments for redundancy charges of Pounds 151m, a Pounds 75m
premium on the repurchase of bonds and the effects on the results of the
disposal of group undertakings, turnover was up by 2.4 per cent in both the
second quarter and the half year.
On the same basis, pre-tax profits rose 5.2 per cent in the second quarter
and 3.7 per cent in the half year while earnings per share were up 5 per
cent in the second quarter and 3.4 per cent in the half year.
An interim dividend of 7.05p will be paid representing a 6 per cent
improvement on last time. Sir Iain said it represented a compromise between
a fair return to shareholders and the present and future needs of the
business.
At the same stage last year, he had warned that the 8.1 per cent rate of
dividend growth awarded then was unlikely to be maintained.
The group had dropped prices 11 times this year under the conditions of its
pricing formula and had already returned about Pounds 1bn to customers in
the form of price cuts with a further Pounds 400m to be shaved in the
present year.
Mr Michael Hepher, managing director, claimed success for the 'Good to talk'
advertising campaign and for specific marketing initiatives such as National
Weekend Rate.
Staff numbers were now 151,600, a 4,400 reduction on the start of the year
and on track for a reduction of 15,000 in the full year.
Sir Iain said that Concert, the group's joint venture with its US equity
partner MCI, was significantly ahead of the competition in being able to
offer international companies 'seamless' voice and data services; the
venture had some 75 new customers representing Pounds 200m in additional
revenue.
Completion of the MCI investment increased the group's gearing at September
30 to 29 per cent with net debt standing at Pounds 3.37bn.
Analysts were yesterday broadly satisfied with BT's performance which they
described as sound across the board. Pre-tax profits estimates for the full
year are unchanged at about the Pounds 2.45bn-Pounds 2.5bn mark and the
shares are seen as good value.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Shell dips as Asia margins tighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production losses from the recent oil strike in Nigeria and tighter refining
margins in Asia caused third-quarter profits for the Royal Dutch/Shell group
to ease back 1 per cent to Pounds 853m.
Shell shares closed 8p down at 711p, after the company reported a 3 per cent
drop in net income for the nine months to Pounds 2.38bn on an estimated
current cost of supplies basis, similar to a replacement costs measure.
Shell, in common with other integrated oil companies, experienced a strong
cyclical rebound in chemical earnings during the third quarter.
Rising volumes and lower operating costs resulted in chemicals' earnings of
Pounds 158m, against a Pounds 168m loss last time. Shell said it was
optimistic that demand would grow as world petrochemicals' markets continue
the recovery in line with stronger economic growth in the main
industrialised economies.
The rebound in chemicals failed, however, to offset tigher refining margins
in Asia, where Shell has extensive downstream interests.
High refining margins in the region drew in imports of refined products from
Middle East producers such as Kuwait. New refinery capacity in the area
eroded margins further, although Shell predicted an improvement in the
fourth quarter.
Total oil product sales were up 8 per cent outside the US, with increases in
Asia and Latin America offsetting a decline in Europe.
The third-quarter results were also depressed by the effects of the Nigerian
oil strike this past summer. The loss of production from Shell's large
onshore fields in Nigeria caused worldwide net equity crude oil production
in the quarter to fall by 2 per cent to 1.69m barrels a day.
Exploration and production earnings fell 37 per cent to Pounds 350m. The
loss of Nigerian output coincided with this year's highest world crude oil
prices.
It also lowered cash flow to Pounds 5.6bn, compared with Pounds 5.8bn last
year.
Shell expects crude oil prices to firm in the fourth quarter, when demand
usually increases because of the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere.
But it noted that price movements were also dependent on the actions of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries at its meeting later this
month.
Capital expenditure and exploration spending for the nine months rose 10 per
cent to Pounds 4.6bn. Total debt remained relatively modest at Pounds 8.2bn,
with a total debt ratio of 18.4 per cent.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Prudential set to reduce directors' service contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest investing institution, is
poised to follow the trend of other large companies and cut the length of
its directors' service contracts.
This follows mounting criticism from institutional shareholders of large
payouts to directors who have resigned while holding long service contracts
which entitle them to payouts of up to three times their basic salary.
The move would also be a significant reversal of the Prudential's policy on
directors' contracts. It has previously given three-year rolling contracts
strong support. Last June it said: 'If we want to recruit and retain the
right quality of executive on to our board, we need to offer them a
competitive remuneration package and currently a three-year contract is part
of that deal.'
This comment was in response to the launch of a campaign by PosTel, the
Pounds 25bn pension fund, calling for a reduction in the length of service
contracts. PosTel votes against the election or re-election of directors
with rolling employment contracts longer than two years.
The Prudential's change of policy is likely to remove the possibility of
PosTel embarrassing the Pru at its annual meeting in May.
Sir Martin Jacomb, the chairman of PosTel, is due to become non-executive
chairman of the Prudential at that meeting.
Five executive directors at the Prudential, including Mr Mick Newmarch, the
chief executive, have three-year rolling contracts. These are likely to be
re-placed with shorter contracts - probably two-year rolling contracts -
following an examination by the board's remuneration committee.
'There is a recognition here now that three-year rolling contracts are
passe,' a senior Prudential executive said yesterday.
The company confirmed the study and the conclusion that 'the market seems to
be moving away from three-year rolling contracts'.
The Prudential denied that Sir Martin's appointment as chairman had
influenced its decision to launch the study.
The company added that it would not try to impose similar cuts in the length
of directors' contracts in the companies in which it holds shares.
Other big public companies, such as Guinness and British Gas, have recently
shortened their directors' contracts.

FT  11 NOV 94 / 'Leftwing elitists' take flak from victorious Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The spirit of political co-operation so evident on the morning after the US
mid-term elections was fast evaporating yesterday, mostly because victorious
Republicans could not resist taking potshots at President Bill Clinton.
Several Republicans also warned the president not to frustrate
implementation of their legislative agenda on issues ranging from increased
defence spending and deeper cuts in social programmes to cuts in foreign
aid.
The most provocative comments came from Congressman Newt Gingrich, virtually
certain to become the next Speaker of the House and - mostly  - still trying
to be magnanimous in victory. He promised, for example, no longer to call
the president an enemy of 'normal' Americans, a favourite pre-election
epithet.
However, what he gave in 24 hours filled with media interviews he also took
away. He described Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary as 'counter-culture
McGovernicks', a derogatory reference to the leftwing Democratic
presidential candidate of 1972. The current White House, he said, was
dominated by 'leftwing elitists'.
Warming to his familiar conservative theme, he said: 'There are profound
things that went wrong, starting with the Great Society (President Lyndon
Johnson's social legislation) and the counter-culture, and until we address
them head-on we're going to have these problems.'
Mr Clinton, he said, would be 'very, very dumb' to try to stand in the way
of the conservative agenda he intended to get through Congress, including
the reintroduction of voluntary prayer in schools by a constitutional
amendment next year.
Mr Bill Archer a congressman from Texas who is likely to be the next
chairman of the House ways and means committee, also expanded on the
Republican tactical approach: 'We can't really get much of anything done
which the president does not want to sign, other than by constitutional
amendment.'
Senator Jesse Helms, the arch-conservative in line to take over the foreign
relations committee, promised deep cuts in foreign aid, including US
contributions to the United Nations and Nato.
Mr Gingrich also warned, only half-jokingly, that the Republicans could now
frustrate the president in other ways. Senator Robert Dole, as majority
leader, could control every appointment Mr Clinton sent up for ratification,
he said.
The president drew his own line in the sand at his Wednesday election
postmortem by promising to work with the new Republican majority in
Congress, but not to permit a return to the economic policies of the 1980s.
Mr Clinton yesterday humorously acknowledged the force of some Republican
positions. Imposing limits on the number of terms members of Congress may
serve, he said with a smile, 'looks better to me every day'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential Corporation has in the past been one of the stoutest
defenders of directors' three-year rolling contracts. So its expected
abandonment of such contracts may sound their death-knell throughout British
industry. Much of the credit must go to the high-profile campaign waged by
Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, PosTel's chief executive. It is surely no
coincidence that Sir Martin Jacomb, currently PosTel's chairman, is due to
become the Pru's chairman next year.
Even if the Pru does not join Mr Ross Goobey's campaign, directors in other
companies will find it harder to cling to their three-year rollers. They
will no longer be able to point to a large institution's practice as
justification for their own.
Rollers allow badly performing executives to receive large pay-offs if they
are forced to resign. The actual sums involved are usually small compared
with companies' market capitalisations. But rewarding failure in this way
damages shareholders' interests not merely through the direct financial
impact but also by undermining employee relations. Rollers are a blatant
example of one rule for directors and another rule for ordinary staff.
That said, the most important impact of PosTel's campaign may be to give a
shot in the arm to shareholder activism. Institutional investors have too
often been prepared to walk away from poorly performing companies rather
than seek to change their boards and/or strategies. It is to be hoped they
will now take a tougher line.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell's rock-solid balance sheet, which includes Pounds 7.8bn in cash and
securities, made the Anglo-Dutch company a safe haven during recession. But
the company's financial strength makes it less attractive for investors at
this stage of the cycle. Shell is under-geared compared with its rivals, so
an equivalent rise in operating profits would have less of an impact on
earnings.
The operational benefits of recovery are also less marked. The group avoided
the sort of crisis that forced BP to cut staff by 35 per cent in just three
years. Without such problems, Shell has found cost-cutting harder to
implement. That was apparent in yesterday's results. For the three months to
September, Shell's replacement cost operating profits, excluding one-off
items, increased quarter on quarter by just 14 per cent. Most oil majors
posted results up between 20 per cent and 30 per cent.
Shell's lack of financial and operating gearing does not necessarily mean
investors should switch into BP. Both Shell and its UK rival are near record
highs. Shell, with a prospective price earnings ratio for 1995 of 15, and BP
at 13.4, are both at slight premiums to the market. That is unusual for oil
companies which traditionally grow more slowly than the economy. The groups'
yields offer no great incentive either. BP has outperformed the market by 25
per cent since April and Shell by 10 per cent. That is enough for now.

FT  11 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Though Allstate now sells little insurance through Sears stores, the group
used to point to tax advantages to justify keeping the two businesses
together. But these benefits decline as Allstate's underwriting performance
improves.
Sears has finally decided that losing the tax break is a cost worth paying
to set the two companies free. The market's initial reaction was to mark
down Allstate shares, partly on fears that a large proportion of Sears'
investors will dump the new Allstate stock, while the Sears share price rose
sharply. In the longer term, they may move the other way.
While Sears will finally revert to being a focused retailing group, it faces
a tough task clawing back its position in the fiercely competitive American
market. On the surface, Allstate's situation is even more difficult since it
was hit by Dollars 845m (Pounds 515m) of earthquake losses in the first nine
months of the year. Yet it is financially strong with a powerful market
position. So its prospects are healthy if only it can reduce its catastrophe
exposure.
In this respect Tuesday's election of a Republican insurance commissioner in
California could prove significant. The new commissioner is likely to prove
more sympathetic to the industry's case than the present incumbent. The
election is also good news for BAT Industries' Farmers unit, which is even
bigger than Allstate in California. A fully independent Allstate is unlikely
to be a more aggressive competitor. But its greater stock market visibility
may emphasise the value of Farmers hidden inside BAT.

FT  11 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Insurance on the crest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter profits from Commercial Union and Royal Insurance demonstrate
that the UK insurance sector is still riding on the crest of a cyclical
wave. But from here on it is likely to be a gentle slide to the next
earnings trough. The magnitude of the bounce in profits merely serves to
highlight the sector's incorrigible cyclicality.
The niceties of insurance accounting ensure that the slowdown in earnings
from current levels will be gradual. However, rates in the key domestic
motor and household markets - which account for nearly the lion's share of
Royal's underwriting profits - have already slipped. They will slip further
as the onslaught from low-cost 'direct' insurers continues. Also set to
deteriorate is the the ratio of claims paid to premium income: the recent
improvement does not look sustainable.
There are plus points. For example, insurers seem willing to forgo market
share in motors rather than pursue new business at uneconomic rates. They
are also maintaining pressure on costs, as highlighted by Royal's plans to
cut its UK workforce by 10 per cent over the next three years. But overall
the medium-term outlook for the UK industry is far from bright.
The outlook for the shares is, however, less dependent on the UK insurance
cycle - or the management's effort to diversify out of it - than the state
of world financial markets. Insurers' investment income is highly geared to
the market and a reversal of the recent sharp underperformance of the sector
is likely to come only with a pronounced equity market rally.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Moscow ready to impose HIV tests on visitors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Foreigners entering Russia will be required to undergo HIV tests at the
border or produce medical certificates showing they have not been exposed to
the Aids virus, under legislation Moscow is expected to adopt soon.
A western diplomat said yesterday the European Union, the US, Canada and
Japan were considering a joint appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to urge him
to veto the legislation. It would be the toughest law of its kind to be
adopted by a large and influential country and could discourage business
travellers and tourists.
Western diplomats are concerned about the technical difficulties Russian
border officials might face in determining the validity of foreign medical
certificates, and the health risks visitors might face if they undergo HIV
tests in Russia, where needles are regularly re-used and often poorly
sterilised.
However, it would be difficult if not impossible for Mr Yeltsin to block the
measure.
Officials at the parliamentary commission on health, which produced the
draft law, said they were confident that the bill, which is scheduled for a
third reading in the State Duma either today or next week, would be passed
by the lower house.
It would then need to be endorsed by the Federation Council, the upper
house, and signed by Mr Yeltsin. A presidential veto could be overruled by a
two-thirds vote in the Duma, which parliamentary officials are certain they
could muster.
The legislation, which in its second reading was opposed by only three of
the 450 deputies in the Duma, has found reluctant supporters among Russian
liberals. They fear that the nation's collapsing healthcare system is too
weak to protect the country against diseases which are a malign side-effect
of growing contacts with the rest of the world.
Ms Svetlana Ulitskaya, the chief expert at the parliamentary commission on
health, said: 'We have an unpleasant choice. Either we can be civilised and
let Aids into our country or we must look uncivilised and close the door.'
Mr Valerii Mestnikov, another health commission official, said the Russian
public was unconcerned about the potential damage the law might do to
western investment and tourism as they had not seen any positive results so
far.
According to Professor Richard Clogg, a fellow at St Antony's College,
Oxford, Russia more than a year ago began to require all travellers from the
embattled Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia to undergo an HIV test at the
Russian border.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Cabinet agrees to cut spending by up to Pounds 5bn: Major
wins backing for Clarke's Budget programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday won cabinet backing for a battle plan for
controversial European Union legislation and public spending cuts of between
Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn.
As the cabinet put the finishing touches to the spending side of this
month's Budget, backbench rightwing rebels dismissed reports that Mr Norman
Lamont, the former chancellor, plans to challenge Mr Major for the Tory
leadership.
In a further embarrassment to the government, it emerged that the powerful
Commons trade and industry committee is considering whether to reopen an
inquiry into the future of the Post Office.
MPs said the committee might call evidence from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, raising the prospect of damaging revelations about
the cabinet's decision to bow to pressure from a handful of backbench
opponents of privatisation.
Mr Bill Cockburn, the Post Office chief executive, last night met Mr
Heseltine to demand rapid progress towards greater commercial freedom.
Mr Cockburn, accompanied by Mr Mike Heron, chairman, is understood to have
sought a reduction of Pounds 100m in the annual Post Office levy to the
government, to pay for investment in more competitive equipment.
Details of the spending programme put forward by Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, were tied up after ministers accepted compromise proposals from
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, for cuts to the Pounds 8bn
housing benefit budget.
Ministers also agreed the outstanding details of plans for a limited
disablement rights bill, designed to mollify those outraged by the
government's opposition earlier this year to a more comprehensive backbench
bill.
Most of the hour-long cabinet meeting was taken up with a debate on the
forthcoming bill to increase British contributions to the EU, which is
bitterly opposed by Tory Euro-sceptics.
Mr Major warned the cabinet that all EU governments are committed to
implementing the increase in contributions by early next year. He urged
ministers to make clear to rightwing critics that the cost is estimated at
only Pounds 75m next year, and a maximum of Pounds 250m by 2000.
The prime minister also told ministers to make sure backbenchers understand
that the bill would lock in arrangements for British rebates from the EU
budget until the end of the century.
In a sign of his confidence that the rebels can be talked into backing down,
Mr Major cancelled a meeting today at which he planned to work out a
strategy for the bill with business managers and top cabinet allies.
Rightwingers continued to threaten the bill, however. Mr Tony Marlow, MP for
Northampton North, said he would fight it 'tooth and nail'. But Mr John
Townend, MP for Bridlington, dismissed reports of a plot to unseat Mr Major.
'It's a load of rubbish. There is no plot. I've got my ear pretty close to
the ground and I don't know about any challenge.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Painful rebirth from the ashes: The economic transition of
the former communist countries is starting to pay off - The fall of the wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On both sides of Europe, businessmen, bankers, politicians and economists
have been frantically at work since the demolition of the Berlin Wall in
1989. The degree of waste and inefficiency in planned economies has proved
greater than anticipated. But the biggest surprise  - both for east
Europeans and for westerners, who had taken it for granted - has been the
subtlety and sophistication of the market economy.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Midland Bank's representative in Moscow 10 years ago, at
that time described the Soviet-style economy as 'a giant cartwheel' with a
powerful rim, hub and spokes. 'But in between the spokes, in the space which
market economies fill with a rich, interconnecting tissue of financial
services, advertising and marketing, pension funds and the like, was a
void,' he explained.
In essence the past five years have been spent cutting back the bloated
bureaucracies and militarised, monopoly producers, fostering private
enterprise and filling up the space between the spokes.
Thousands of would-be entrepreneurs, bankers and stockbrokers from the east
have set out on a quest to discover the secret of abundance, and the
mechanisms by which wealth is created. And an army of western economists,
consultants, accountants and lawyers has sprung into action to satisfy this
demand.
A new institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was
set up to facilitate the transition, while the European Union and individual
governments set up special funds, such as the UK's Know-How Fund, to channel
aid and transfer skills.
Fundamental principles were rediscovered. The most important was the crucial
role of private ownership and the linkage between legality, democracy and
prosperity. The communist state began by seizing private property. The
restitution of private property and privatisation of state-owned assets have
been at the heart of the transition to a law-based, multi-party market
economy and society.
By early next year, with the completion of the second round of mass
privatisation, the Czech government forecasts that 80 per cent of the
economy will be in private ownership. The private sector in most other
central European states now constitutes between 40-65 per cent of the
economy. Even Russia, where macro-economic stabilisation policies are still
being formulated, has managed to privatise about 50 per cent of the economy.
Privatisation has never before taken place on such a scale and at such
frantic speed. And while the privatisation itself has not created enterprise
capital or managerial expertise, it has generated the need for efficient
banks, stock markets and investment funds and sparked off a hunt for foreign
equity investment and managerial skills. The distance from the old command
economy is already enormous.
However, the pain has been greater than originally imagined. Although, the
death agonies of the old system have been exaggerated by a statistical
reporting system based mainly on output from state enterprises, the first
two to three years of reform did see a 20 to 40 per cent fall in industrial
output.
Production of armaments, shoddy consumer goods and obsolete industrial
equipment fell. Millions of workers in what had been secure jobs were
sacked, placing a large burden of social payments on state budgets at the
same time as revenues from taxes on state enterprise profits were
collapsing. Entire industries and company towns have closed or have
stockpiled unwanted goods, failed to pay wages and run up impossible debts.
This industrial decline has been accelerated by the collapse of the Comecon
trade and transferable rouble payments system in late 1990, and exacerbated
by recession and protectionism in the west. Most central European countries
now do more than 50 per cent of their trade with the EU, which, through a
series of bilateral and 'asymmetric' association agreements, offers free
trade in many industrial products but retains restrictions on 'sensitive'
products such as iron, steel, textiles and foodstuffs backed by anti-dumping
and other blocking measures.
In the confusion of the transition to a market economy, many of the state's
best assets have been hived off by communist era factory managers. This has
left the loss-making cores of thousands of enterprises facing bankruptcy. In
Ukraine, Russia and those former Soviet republics where output was
concentrated in military or related sectors, severe problems remain.
But the important point is that the unreformable Soviet system had to be
destroyed if resources were to be freed for productive purposes and export,
instead of being turned into arms or pollution.
Millions of jobs have been created in trade, services and private
enterprises. A wide range of consumer goods, previously unavailable or
restricted to an elite, is now on sale in privatised shops and kiosks. Some
people have grown very rich; the weak, sick and unemployed have become
poorer. But overall the dynamism of the private sector is impressive and
remains under-recorded.
Countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, which established
macro-economic stabilisation and internally convertible currencies at an
early stage, are now leading an economic upswing throughout central Europe.
The great question of five years ago, of how to create capitalism without
capital, has been largely answered: it has been accumulated from the savings
made by reducing waste and through the privatisation of poorly used former
state assets.
But in the former Soviet Union, in particular, billions of dollars of
capital have been created through the often clandestine expropriation and
export of raw materials, energy and other resources. Many 'robber barons'
have set up foreign bank accounts, awaiting the legal reforms in Russia that
will allow them to repatriate their suitably laundered funds. This capital,
like that amassed by the US and European equivalents in the 19th century, is
needed to capitalise the new private banks and to finance the plants and
infrastructure required to begin the industrial transformation of Russia.
Foreign investment to date has been modest, relative to other emerging
economies in Asia or Latin America. The EBRD calculates that total foreign
direct investment in 1990-93 in the entire former Soviet controlled area,
with 450m inhabitants, totalled Dollars 12.42bn. Singapore alone, with only
3m people, received Dollars 5.6bn just in 1992.
But the slow start was inevitable, given the absence of property title and
the lack of legal and administrative frameworks required to attract and
absorb foreign capital. Foreign investment is now rising, as companies
discover the region's potential and east European governments introduce
institutional changes and open up strategic sectors, such as
telecommunications.
Successful foreign debt reduction and rescheduling agreements by Poland and
Bulgaria have also played a part. Poland, which claims to have received
Dollars 4.5bn in foreign investment to date, expects a similar amount in the
next year or so.
Governments throughout the region have become more sophisticated and more
aware of the global competition for foreign investment. They have learnt
that foreign investment brings more than capital: it also provides
technology, managerial skills and access to world markets.
The big US multinationals and their European equivalents, such as Asea Brown
Boveri, Unilever and Nestle, have been among the first to see the potential
of the east. But close observers, such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
University, argue that EU nations must declare war on their protectionist
lobbies, abolish trade barriers and speed up investment if eastern Europe is
to achieve 'Asian tiger' rates of growth.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Learning the right lessons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, after six years of attempts, the UK government has passed one of
the most difficult tests of domestic policy: devising a workable national
curriculum for schools. The final text published yesterday hardly deserves
an 'A' grade. But although the teaching unions have given only a grudging
response, the proposals look like delivering peace in Britain's schools
after years of turbulence.
A year ago that looked unlikely. The curriculum proposals, which stemmed
originally from unease about falling standards of literacy and numeracy, had
become so detailed and extensive that they threatened to engulf every minute
of the teaching day. Meanwhile, the desire to raise national standards in
core subjects had become an obsession with testing almost everything.
The problem has been that the government envisaged the curriculum and the
associated system of tests as performing three entirely separate functions:
setting a standard of education to which schools should aim; providing a
Nationwide picture of how students are doing; and giving parents and
teachers benchmarks for the progress of individual pupils. In trying to
satisfy those ambitions, the original curriculum risked performing no task
well.
Slimmed down
The final version of the curriculum, the product of an 18-month review by
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, untangles much of that muddle. It holds to the main principles
laid out in a preliminary revision in May: many areas have been slimmed
down, and the core subjects English, mathematics and science have been
strengthened, as have information technology courses.
There are still unwelcome signs of party ideology: UK history must be taught
even to pupils under seven years old, and, in line with the pledge the prime
minister made to his party conference, schools must encourage competitive
team sports. There are also signs of confusion about the aims of science
teaching; the emphasis on natural sciences has increased, but there is much
fiddling with the detailed content of lessons. Such points aside, schools'
anxieties about the rigidity and workload of the original proposals have
been broadly answered.
National standards
So too have many concerns about testing, in a series of radical revisions to
the original proposals. In recommending testing by external examiners at
ages 11 and 14, rather than by schools themselves, the curriculum has become
more clearly a tool for assessing national standards and comparing schools.
At the same time, it has rightly relinquished the impossible goal of
providing standards by which to monitor every child.
The changes appear to have pacified most of the teaching unions, who should
now withdraw gracefully from boycotting tests. They should recognise that,
having gained so many concessions, they could lose much sympathy by
persisting. The unions can, however, credit themselves with engineering,
almost inadvertently, an important improvement in education policy which
would otherwise not have taken place.
The pity of the saga is that a workable curriculum has been devised almost
by chance, out of a dispute that began on the narrow territory of teachers'
workload. Mishandling of that squabble by both sides widened the debate; it
is a happy accident that such a bitter row has produced a workable policy.
The government has now come up with more or less the right answer. But it
earns few marks for the painful and prolonged route it took to get there.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Ratifying the round
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An electorally battered President Bill Clinton is about to fly to Jakarta
for the second annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
forum. Foreign policy success matters to the president, but in this case
what he achieves abroad will be determined by events at home. The US will
create nothing concrete within Apec if the Uruguay Round outcome is not
ratified.
That task falls to the lame-duck Congress. Some argue that a duck as lame as
this one has become has no right to pass legislation of such significance.
It would indeed have been better to have ratified the legislation sooner.
But there is no alternative. If the bill were to die in the present
Congress, it could not be reintroduced into the next one under the 'fast
track' authority. Amendments would then be possible and, being possible,
would be probable. If the round were passed in a different form from what
was negotiated, it would have to be reopened. The chances that others would
agree to that idea, after seven years of wearisome negotiations, can be
defined simply as zero.
This notion of a later consideration is frivolous. The US has a simple
choice: to ratify or not - and the time to decide is now. The US is, it
appears, also the only country in the world to have important substantive
doubts about the deal. So a heavy weight now falls on the shoulders of this
particular lame duck.
The benefits of the round are not the smallest part of what is at stake. A
report from the Gatt secretariat, out today, presents the results in greater
detail than hitherto. In addition, it uses a sophisticated economic model to
evaluate the benefits to total world income, which it assesses at an
increase of Dollars 510bn in 2005, including a gain of Dollars 122bn for the
US. Huge as it is, this excludes the effects of the round on services,
intellectual property and, more generally, on security of market access.
Over-optimistic
Such calculations also rest on the over-optimistic assumption that the
alternative to ratification would be the status quo ante. Yet the decision
to initiate the Uruguay Round was a response not just to protectionist
pressures, but also to the belief that the international trading system had
become too incomplete to remain relevant. The final deal is the product of
the seven years of the round, themselves following around four years of
preparation. If, after 11 years of effort, the outcome fails to be ratified
by the country that drove the process throughout, the system will stand
condemned as irrelevant to the problems of today. Everything achieved before
the round would then start to unravel.
The credibility of the US is as much at stake as that of the multilateral
trading system. It is unlikely, for example, that countries would be
prepared to enter into complex negotiations on an Apec-wide free trade
agreement if the US was unable to ratify the Uruguay Round. Such a
negotiation would be condemned as a waste of time: full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.
Leap forward
The puzzling thing about the doubts surfacing in the US is that the Uruguay
Round is, in every important respect, its baby. It was the US that wanted
inclusion of agriculture, services, intellectual property and trade-related
investment measures. It was also the US that wanted a more effective dispute
settlement procedure. While the outcome has inevitably fallen short of
initial US demands, it is also a huge leap forward. The World Trade
Organisation is, in fact, a remarkable achievement of global co-operation.
Yet at this very moment of triumph, people in the US have rediscovered the
old concerns about sovereignty that buried the International Trade
Organisation back in the late 1940s. The truth, however, is that unbridled
national sovereignty is impossible in the case of trade, because two
governments are always involved. There is no alternative to some kind of
international agreement if conditions for global trade are to be both
predictable and liberal.
This is what the US learnt in the 1930s. It is now 60 years since the
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act started the country on the journey that
culminated in the Uruguay Round agreement. The process underpinned the
postwar success of the market economies, which is why countries like China
and Russia want to join. Now, in the post-cold war era, economics have also
taken a central place in international political relations. Failure by the
US to ratify the round would, therefore, amount in one moment to a
repetition of the two great mistakes of the inter-war period - the vote
against the League of Nations in 1919 and the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930.
To make those mistakes once was calamity enough. To repeat them would be
unforgiveable. It is often difficult to know in advance whether an event is
historic. But this is certainly one. The Uruguay Round decision is a
defining moment in the history of US relations with the rest of the world.
The achievement of the deal was bipartisan. The challenge now is to both
parties. All concerned must remember what is at stake.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Personal View: Sweden must vote Yes for influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PER MAGNUS WIJKMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday, Sweden votes on whether to join the European Union. If the
majority is against, it will remain a member of the European Economic Area,
the free-trade zone that links the EU with members of the European Free
Trade Association (Efta).
The vote is too close to call. But there is a danger that an indecisive and
insecure electorate is poised to vote No by a close margin, fearing a Yes
vote will change Sweden for the worse and unaware that it will help change
Europe for the better.
If Swedes appreciate influence on matters that affect them, they will vote
Yes. The EEA provides the Efta countries with little influence. The common
administrative and decision-making institutions proposed when the EEA was
first negotiated have never materialised. EEA rules are in reality
determined by the EU's decision-making procedures.
The Efta countries face a constant stream of legislation from Brussels,
which they are obliged to take on board without much say in its development
if the EEA is to remain homogeneous. In the words of the Swedish prime
minister, Ingvar Carlsson, the formal sovereignty of Sweden in the EEA is
the sovereignty of the powerless.
Becoming a full EU member would increase Sweden's influence over EU
legislation. And even though a small country prepared to pool sovereignty in
such a union runs the risk of being outvoted, EU voting procedures give such
countries relatively large influence.
While Sweden would have four out of 90 votes in the Council of Ministers of
an enlarged union, Germany, with a population nine times larger, would have
only 10 votes. If both Sweden and Norway follow Finland into the EU, the
four Nordic countries would have 13 votes, more than not only Germany, but
the UK and Italy too.
Further, each country has a veto on questions determined by unanimity. On
questions decided by qualified majority, a small number of countries can
block a decision. A small country can be influential if it builds winning
coalitions.
One argument for a No vote is that EU membership will bring few economic
benefits, above those of membership of the EEA. This overlooks the economic
dividends of greater influence on legislation and the increased investment
in Sweden that membership would generate.
Sweden's public debt and deficits are among the largest in Europe. If it
joins the EU it would be encouraged to reduce both to meet economic
convergence programmes. A reduction in the deficit would help lessen the
damaging differential between long-term interest rates in Sweden and in
Germany - now running at four percentage points.
Lower interest rates and the certainty that future EU rules would apply in
Sweden would also generate an investment boom. This would help the
unemployed and the young - as new entrants to the labour market - by
reducing unemployment, now running at 13 per cent of the labour force.
Public sector employees, mainly women, would also benefit, since the
sector's current size can be maintained only if Sweden's industrial base is
strengthened.
Yet, as the referendum approaches, wishful thinking has flourished to avoid
facing the hard choices. Some contend that if Swedes vote against
membership, it would be possible to renegotiate the EEA agreement to gain
greater influence over legislation. This seems unlikely. The European Court
of Justice struck down the only common institution in the EEA agreement, the
proposed EEA Court, as unconstitutional. And the Efta countries' negotiating
power is less than when the EEA was negotiated, partly because the political
will to accommodate them has diminished, and partly because there could soon
be only two or three Efta members left in the EEA.
Others, recalling the first Danish referendum over Maastricht, argue that a
No vote on Sunday would make it possible for Sweden to renegotiate its
accession agreement. However, Denmark was already a member of the EU with a
veto over the Maastricht treaty that gave it a strong negotiating position.
A Swedish No vote would be similar to the Swiss rejection of entry to the
EEA in 1992. A debt-burdened Sweden on the periphery of Europe can ill
afford to be an outsider.
Finally, some have argued for a No vote to give the country space to make
the final decision in a few years' time. But to stand by and watch other
countries - including Sweden's closest neighbours - shaping the EU would be
to miss a golden opportunity.
EU members will hold an intergovernmental conference in 1996 to shape
foreign, security and defence policies, relations with eastern Europe,
agricultural and fisheries policies, and economic and monetary union. Now,
if ever, is the time to join the EU.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Winkled out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having recently created a record 58 new partners, Goldman Sachs probably
feels it can afford to let slip a few other names. But probably not
fixed-income chief Mark Winkelman.
The departure of Dutch-born Winkelman is a serious blow to the investment
bank. Several key partners - including previous chairman Stephen Friedman
and head of its Japanese operation, Henry James - have now resigned in the
last few months. And given that Goldman is struggling to recover from this
year's bond market crash, Winkelman's razor-sharp trading skills will surely
be missed.
He is withdrawing to spend more time with his family - yes, that old cliche.
But in September Winkelman was passed over for the firm's leadership. His
fellow co-head of Goldman's bond business, Jon Corzine, was named chairman
and senior partner, while investment banking supremo Henry Paulson became
vice-chairman. At 48, Winkelman is a year older than Corzine and the same
age as Paulson; did he deduce his chances of becoming top dog were slim?
What will he do, apart from enjoying domesticity? Goldman's Wall Street
rivals might be drooling, but Winkelman insists he will probably move into
teaching, like other Goldmanites who have gone before him.

Marcel Duchamp would turn in his grave; he once sent shivers down the spine

Ping at Paris's Georges Pompidou centre.
On Tuesday he assembled a group of spiders, scorpions, snakes and toads in
an exhibition wittily entitled Hors Limites, l'art et la vie, 1952-1994 -
Beyond Limits, art and life. They were to eat one another, making a
statement on humankind's dog-eat-dog world. Unfortunately, police closed the
exhibition yesterday using laws forbidding cruelty to animals.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's finance minister Ciro Gomes promised to lower the job's profile
when he took over in September. But so quickly? Gomes has annoyed so many
businessmen and government officials that he has stopped giving media
interviews for fear of starting any more rows. In Sao Paulo this week he
ended up fleeing from the press.
Gomes has made some vicious attacks on companies which raise prices. Nor has
calling Brazilian consumers 'suckers' for paying high prices, and
threatening to raise interest rates 'sky high' greatly endeared him to
Brazilians.
Gomes says he will stay in the job until his close ally, president elect
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, takes office on January 1. What happens to Gomes
then is anyone's guess; the portfolio for spreading goodwill and
enlightenment is probably not available.

Ray Fionda - not a flavour but vice-chairman of the Association of Mobile

Not bad going: two new central bank governors in one day. The announcement
of Yasuo Matsushita at the Bank of Japan and Bodil Nyboe Andersen at the
Danish central bank adds to the impression that the exchange rate in central
bank governors is becoming increasingly volatile.
They used to be such a stable bunch. Erik Hoffmeyer, who has been running
the Danish central bank for 30 years, is a local hero in Denmark and a
permanent fixture on the international monetary circuit. And he was not the
longest serving central banker. Iceland's Johannes Nordal who retired a year
or so ago had run his central bank even longer.
Leaving aside Luxembourg's Pierre Jaans, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands
now becomes the grand old man of European central banking and he has only
been doing his job since 1981, according to the Morgan Stanley Central
Banking Directory. Nine of the European Union's central bank governorships
have changed hands over the last couple of years - which must be some sort
of record.
Then there are all the new faces popping up in eastern Europe. How else will
Moscow's Tatyana recognise Tokyo's Yasuo if they don't start wearing big
lapel badges at international gatherings? Pretty soon there won't be a
central bank governor left who can remember the third world debt crisis or
the last time there was a run on a big US money centre bank.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the editor: East-West co-operation on farming
beneficial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NEIL SPOONER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his Farmer's Viewpoint ('Exaggerated threat seen in eastern
promise', November 8), David Richardson argued that British farmers need not
be too concerned about the huge potential of agriculture in eastern Europe
and the former Soviet Union. He says British farmers lack the skills
necessary to start operating in these countries, and the threat of
competition back home is still a long way off due to cultural, capital,
political and climatic problems. He is wrong on both counts.
Countries like Ukraine have a clear potential to compete in world markets
for leading crops like cereals and oilseeds. Yields of the most progressive
farmers are already well above the UK average and farmers are exporting
profitably, not only to the huge regional market but to Europe and North
America as well.
The answer is not to bury heads in the sand waiting for a 'serious threat 10
years from now'. The countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe
should be regarded as a new opportunity for western Europe's beleaguered
farmers. East/West co-operation in farm production offers significant
benefits to both sides. For eastern farmers co-operation brings access to
investment capital, farm business and marketing skills, knowledge about new
technologies and customer contacts. To western farmers it opens up a whole
new set of potentially profitable investment opportunities and access to new
markets.
We should stop talking about ensuring that the EU's protected markets remain
closed to unfair competition and become more proactive in encouraging
western farmers to take some practical steps to invest in the east.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Information from NRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ED GALLAGHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The NRA has been accused by the Campaign for Freedom of Information
('River information paid for by the piggy bank', November 9) of overcharging
the public as a means of inhibiting the release of information which they
are entitled to have. This is not so.
The NRA is an open organisation. Every regional office holds a register of
information which the public is entitled to inspect free of charge. The
typical charge for photocopies from the registers is Pounds 1, which
includes up to 10 copies.
Only where complex investigations are required, or where information is
requested for commercial purposes will a higher charge be levied. The NRA
makes no profit from these charges which are based on actual costs incurred.
We do not charge school children. There is a comprehensive education pack
available free to every primary school in England and Wales and many of
their requests can be satisfied from our 600 reports and leaflets, many of
which are free of charge, and which we supply willingly.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Phased Ecu launch a necessity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW VAN HUSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a proponent of free trade between the North American Free Trade Area
and the EU - if anything, to counter the Japanese challenge more effectively
 -I am disheartened by opposition, especially in the UK, to proposals by
Germany and France to launch the Ecu in phases, the so-called multi-speed
approach.
The EU will probably have some 16 to 20 members by the end of this decade -
the target date for monetary union - and it is unrealistic to expect
consensus by all involved, given wide disparities in social and economic
development. Put another way, it is highly doubtful that all members will
have met the stringent fiscal and budgetary discipline required by
Maastricht.
Decision-making in such an unwieldy assortment of nations needs to be
revised anyway, to make it a functioning and effective union. So the idea of
getting the Ecu off the ground by those countries which are fully committed
to it and could qualify now under Maastricht strikes me as necessary, and
the only way to move Europe towards a single currency. It is critical if the
EU is to remain internationally competitive (not to speak of its
psychological impact).
That Europe needs to rid itself of (now) 12 currencies in the space of 2.35m
sq km (the size of Zaire or Sudan or Algeria) is self-evident. Such a number
of currencies promotes inefficiencies for business and individuals alike. It
is hopelessly ponderous and, in these days of fast trains crossing countries
in mere hours, it does not make sense any more. The yen and dollar now rule
the world. A union with 450m people, soon to exceed half a billion, can no
longer be left behind.
The 'inner core' initiative, probably encompassing France, Germany and the
Benelux, should be applauded by the rest of the EU members. They are taking
the risks. While the Ecu will not replace national currencies at this stage,
and would amount to alternative tender, the whole initiative could fail. But
it is a beginning that needs to be tried, lest the Maastricht ideals fall
apart.

energy

<TEXT>
The UK government is now deep into its deliberations on the future of the
state-owned nuclear power industry. One of the key issues is whether private
money can finance further development of the industry, through privatisation
or funding new projects. Without it, the nuclear power industry has a highly
uncertain future in the UK: it is most unlikely that any further nuclear
power stations would be paid for by any government, Tory or Labour.
But is the City ready to put up the money instead?
This was not the case when the electricity industry was privatised in 1989.
The intention then was to sell off the nuclear component as well, but the
plan was withdrawn because investors were unhappy with the risks and high
cost of decommissioning old nuclear power stations.
The City has since become more sanguine about nuclear energy. Several City
institutions are looking for ways of involving the private sector. BZW, the
investment bank, and KPMG, the accountancy firm, are advising the Department
of Trade and Industry on the prospects for privatising the two generators,
Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, which, by some estimates, could raise
more than Pounds 2bn.
Nuclear Electric has hired Morgan Stanley, the US investment house, to
explore investor attitudes to nuclear energy. It has also asked NM
Rothschild if private money could be raised to finance construction of a new
nuclear power station.
Morgan Stanley's report, the only one so far issued, was bullish about the
prospects. Based on other countries' experiences with private sector nuclear
utilities, such as the US, Germany, and Japan, Morgan Stanley concluded
investors were sophisticated enough to understand the risks - the
implication being that Nuclear Electric could be privatised.
The Rothschilds report is not yet complete. But Mr Mike Kirwan, Nuclear
Electric's finance director, says it is edging towards positive - if
qualified - conclusions. It will say that private sector money could be
found for nuclear power station construction provided a well-tried design
was used and Nuclear Electric was closely involved in the building and
operation of any new station. Such a project could be put together using
rates of return close to those of the new gas-fired power plants currently
being financed - and below the 11 per cent assumed by Nuclear Electric up to
now.
But these institutions are all working for the industry. What of independent
bankers and financiers? Here, views are more mixed. Several analysts say the
City has paid little attention to the nuclear review. 'Investors only start
thinking about a project when someone sticks a prospectus under their
noses,' says one. 'We are a long way from that.'
But the City is now clearly less concerned about the risk of catastrophe or
environmental contamination.
The perception of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear has also shifted:
they are now seen as commercial concerns with capable and communicative
managements. The fact that they have made determined efforts to cut costs
and become profitable has been noted, and their annual accounts have begun
to acquire greater credibility with financial analysts. In particular, the
companies' estimates of decommissioning costs are considered to be more
realistic than in 1989.
But the more commercial nuclear energy becomes, the more the City is
inclined to ask hard-nosed questions about the nuclear generation business.
A large risk overhanging the industry is seen to be government interference.
Nuclear companies would need government promises of full commercial freedom
for privatisation to succeed. But this would be no guarantee against future
government intervention which might try to restrict nuclear activities, or
require heavier decommissioning provisions, so affecting profits.
This freedom would have to extend to managing one of the industry's major
costs: waste. At the moment, the two companies have to use the expensive
services of British Nuclear Fuels, the state monopoly, when cheaper means
are available, such as on-site storage. They are also shareholders in Nirex,
the state agency which handles long-term radioactive waste disposal.
Analysts say these ties would have to be loosened if the two companies were
to be truly commercial.
The point about commercial freedom is of particular concern because few
analysts believe more power stations will be built, due to public
opposition. The two companies must therefore be able to branch out if they
are to grow and pay rising dividends.
For privatisation to work, the government would have to create a package
attractive to the City. This means the dirtiest and costliest parts - the
first generation Magnox reactors - remaining in state ownership. But both
companies would also have to set up a segregated fund for their
decommissioning provisions to persuade investors they were safe for the long
term. Currently, these appear on the general balance sheet where they can
easily be diverted.
The City's mixed views on privatisation are an improvement from the wholly
negative ones held in 1989. Mr Kirwan of Nuclear Electric says he is
encouraged by conversations with financiers. 'I think investors realise
decommissioning is only construction in reverse, albeit with a longer time
frame,' he says. 'It is normal for investors to accept it and pay for it.'
Some analysts agree that privatisation could be on the cards. 'It's do-able,
but it's really a matter of political will,' says Mr John Reynolds,
electricity analyst at James Capel, who thinks that the sale could be done
in 1996.
But few analysts expect action under this government. Although there would
be gains for the Treasury from an early sale, and the electricity market
would benefit from greater competition, the implications of nuclear
privatisation may be too momentous for a precarious government in the run-up
to an election by mid-1997.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Oxbridge problem is its products'
'special' status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Oxbridge arrogance' (Truth of the Matter, October 15),
Nigel Spivey, editor of the Cambridge Review, joins his many colleagues in
the Oxbridge establishment in dismissing me as a bigoted 'knocker' of our
ancient universities.
Referring to my book, The Oxbridge Conspiracy, he writes that 'to perpetuate
the mythology of some cabalistic, public-school, backward-looking Oxbridge
is pure prejudice, and it is a prejudice to which Walter Ellis . . . must
confess'.
In fact, my book makes clear (to those who bother to read it) that what is
wrong with Oxbridge is not its residual bias towards the public schools, but
the fact that its products, both state and private, are treated by English
society as a special caste, whose entry to the corridors of power, privilege
and wealth is assured, overwhelmingly, by virtue not of academic
performance, but attendance.
Other universities have bright people, too, but they must fight to be
noticed.
Spivey's reference to 'beefy' Magdalene College rugby players lining up to
urinate in front of their retiring Master scarcely refutes this contention,
even if several of the masterly micturators did come from a Swansea
comprehensive. Nor, surely, is it helpful to his case to point out how
'gratifying' it is that so many of the nation's top jobs are held by
Oxbridge graduates. Britain, he says, needs more arrogance, not less. Well,
if so, we know who to look to for a lead.

FT  11 NOV 94 / A cut for everyone: The debate over the cost of capital in
the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the UK, a well-oiled system helps companies raise new equity capital by
selling shares to their existing shareholders.
There is growing concern, however, among regulators, companies and some
investment bankers that the system is too expensive. Alternative ways of
raising capital used in other countries are cheaper and just as good, they
suggest.
'The cost of capital in this country is too high because of our arcane
practices,' says Mr Amir Eilon, director of corporate finance at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, the investment bank.
The Office of Fair Trading is reviewing the system that requires companies
raising new capital to pay fixed commission charges, regardless of the
attractiveness of the shares or market conditions at the time they are sold.
An unpublished study by Professor Paul Marsh of the London Business School
for the OFT has concluded that institutional investors which help launch new
share offerings have earned what he describes as 'excess returns' of about
Pounds 240m between 1986 and 1993.
The UK system works like this: a company that wants to raise capital by
issuing shares finds an investment banking adviser to structure the deal and
underwrite it, that is promise to buy all the shares at the agreed price. To
spread the risk, the investment bank finds institutions among existing
shareholders that agree to sub-underwrite the offering. They promise to buy
a parcel of the new shares at the agreed price, even if there is a lower
market price on the final day of the offer.
Under the UK system of pre-emption rights, the new shares must be offered to
existing shareholders, normally at a discount to the current market price of
typically around 13 to 15 per cent (although discounts vary). These rights
give them the opportunity to buy new shares in equal proportion to their
current stake so that they can maintain their proportion of the share
capital.
In addition to the discounted new shares - which typically earn the same
dividends as the existing shares - sub-underwriters receive a standard fee
of 1.25 per cent of the total raised. The broker receives a standard 0.25
per cent commission and the adviser a 0.50 per cent commission. The cost of
issuing the new shares is therefore 2 per cent of the capital raised, plus -
arguably - the discount on the shares sold to existing shareholders.
'Underwriters and sub-underwriters perform a useful service for companies by
assuming the risks of a failed issue. Historically, however, at least for
equity rights issues, the evidence indicates that the fees they charge for
the assumption of this risk significantly exceed the value of the insurance
they provide,' the LBS report says.
London's traditional merchant banks, for which the rights issue system is an
important part of their business, defend their corner, however. Commissions
are fixed, they argue, because it would be impractical to negotiate the fee
with hundreds of institutions which must make snap judgments about whether
to sub-underwrite at the offer price.
And while the commission is the same for all issues, the more attractive
shares can be offered at a smaller discount than less attractive issues.
Finance directors privately argue that a system which forces them to issue
new shares at a discount raises the cost of capital. More shares have to be
issued to raise the same amount of capital and a dividend paid on each one.
'That means the pay-back from the new capital will have to be significantly
higher,' according to the finance director at one FTSE-100 company. 'It then
defines the sorts of investment that a company can make.'
But Mr Anthony Beevor, head of corporate finance at Hambros Bank, says the
arguments about the discount are irrelevant because the true owners of a
public company are its shareholders. 'You are giving the shares more cheaply
to yourself,' he says.
But privately, even the institutional shareholders which publicly defend
pre-emption rights and which benefit most from fixed commissions question
whether the system is in companies' best interests.
An alternative advocated by some of the larger investment banks is US-style
'global book-building'. With book-building, the shares are heavily marketed
by the investment bank handling the issue. The price of the new shares is
set at a level that reflects market demand, rather than at an automatic
discount to the market price as in most UK rights offerings.
However, book-building is difficult to reconcile with UK shareholders'
pre-emption rights, which require that the new shares are marketed only to
existing investors. There may be ways round pre-emption rights, but they can
be applied only in limited circumstances.
And regulators fear that book-building is less attractive for secondary
offerings, where a stakeholder sells a large block of shares and pre-emption
rights do not apply, because of the absence of Stock Exchange rules on
short-selling. In the run-up to a bookbuilding exercise, shareholders can
sell shares they do not own and drive down the price of a company's shares,
to reduce the cost of the new shares.
In October, the London Stock Exchange launched a review of rules on
short-selling, asking whether there ought to be greater disclosure of short
positions. Both the Stock Exchange review and the OFT enquiry are understood
to have the blessing of the UK Treasury which is concerned partly because it
fears London may lose its edge as the centre for international share trading
because of higher costs.
However, London's traditionalists say that the current system makes capital
raising in the UK cheaper than elsewhere because fees are lower.
If fees are the only cost of capital, the data suggests there is merit in
this argument. According to Securities Data Corporation, a New Jersey-based
research firm, the average fee in 1993 for an under-written offering of
dollars 100m or more in the US was 5.048 per cent. Fees ranged from 2.25
percent to 7 per cent.
Mr Beevor argues that by comparison, the 2.0 per cent fixed fee in the UK is
cheap. Even critics of the current system agree that for all its
short-comings, it has been effective in guaranteeing UK corporations access
to equity capital through good times and bad, and that alone may be good
reason not to tinker with it.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: The Ugly Man - Antony Thorncroft reviews an exciting
new writing talent from Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brad Fraser is currently as hot as pepperoni, with plays like Unidentified
Human Remains and Poor Superman creating a buzz with both critics and
audiences. This young Canadian writer deftly mixes at-the-edge scenarios
involving gay sex, nudity, violence and betrayal, with cool insouciant
dialogue and a dry wit. The Ugly Man, enjoying its London premiere at the
Battersea Arts Centre, is minor Fraser, but still well worth a detour down
Lavender Hill.
Fraser had the bright idea of taking his plot from one of the most gory of
Jacobean melodramas, Middleton's The Changeling, and then encouraging his
contemporary characters, who talk with the direct simplicity of comic strip
balloons, and inhabit scenes as short and pointed as those in an Australian
soap opera, to run riot.
The Co-Active Theatre Company has decided to locate the play in the equally
decadent society of the southern states, or rather the fantasy South of
Tennessee Williams, where every closet is crammed with skeletons and inside
every virgin is a desperate whore. The result is a theatrical Twin Peaks,
scary yet funny, grotesque yet childlike.
By some miracle the cast of CAT Factory deliver it straight, with not a
trace of a nudge or a wink. Martin McDougall as Leslie, who plays a
physically and mentally abused gay with a hair-lip, manages to speak the
line 'He's twice the man you'll ever be' with a quivering conviction that
touches the soul.
The 'man' concerned is the servant Forest, the scarred stranger, the Ugly
Man, whose murderous, rapacious, undeviating villainy is motivated not by
aimless violence but by revenge. This is the key role and Martin Malone
exactly captures the physical stillness hiding a barely controlled menace.
Forest is impelled towards evil; for Veronica, (Stephanie Prince), the young
virgin bride, evil is a drug. She quickly progresses from twisting her
doomed mother Sabina (Louise Plowright) round her finger, to manipulating
men: her naive fiance; her calculating lover; the besotted Forest, who will
kill for a kiss.
Such Grand Guignol needs a realistic setting. Director Michael D'Cruze has
located the action in Arizona for no obvious reason, but designer James
Hendy has come up with an impressive barn-like set, dominated by a giant
wheel, handy for grinding out justice slow. The power of the production
tells in the little touches, like Veronica's white dress streaked scarlet,
unmentioned by the others, but shrieking testimony that she has sold her
soul to the Devil.
The climax cuts across the controlled playing - it is easier to accept a
body-strewn stage when the characters are decked out as 16th century
Spaniards - but The Ugly Man does nothing to dispel the belief that Fraser
is one of the most exciting writers working in North America.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Musical farce and honour - Andrew Clark visits the
Massenet festival in Saint-Etienne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No French city has found a niche in the music market as deservedly as
Saint-Etienne, home of the biennial Massenet festival. During his lifetime,
the composer turned his back on his birthplace, and the city today - a dowdy
mining centre just off the massif central - is a tourist's disaster area.
But in recent years Saint-Etienne has developed a useful business in
Massenet revivals, and the music world is taking note.
First came Amadis in 1988, then Cleopatre in 1990, Esclarmonde and
Griselidis in 1992, and now Panurge and Le Cid. Thas and Marie-Magdeleine
are promised for 1996. When you consider how little the French have done to
explore the lesser-known works of Berlioz or Chabrier, Saint-Etienne is
serving Massenet rather well.
The local opera company throws FFr9.5m (Pounds 1.1m), or 25 per cent of its
annual budget, into ten days of music. Sponsorship from France Telecom and a
recording deal with Koch-Schwann help to pay for the soloists. At the last
two festivals, money seemed plentiful. This year bore signs of cost-paring
and under-preparation. Unlike 1992, the local orchestra shouldered the
burden of work alone - which may explain the sub-standard playing in
Panurge. Few of the principals showed the familiarity with their roles that
one expects at a festival.
Panurge, a three-act musical farce, had not been performed since 1913, the
year of its posthumous Paris premiere. Based on a novel by the 16th century
French writer Rabelais, it tells of the misunderstandings, adventures and
eventual reunion of Panurge and his wife Colombe. Some of the action has a
whiff of sit-com - as when Colombe, trying to make her errant husband
jealous, confesses her supposed infidelities to a gossiping priest, who is
none other than Panurge in disguise. The music is slight and full of parody
(has any other composer written a sheep's chorus?), and there is some subtle
16th century pastiche. But Massenet could have written it in his sleep.
The Saint-Etienne production, staged and designed by Adriano Sinivia, looked
more like a half-baked Gozzi pantomime than a comedy of the sexes a la
francaise. The mobile toy-box sets resembled a children's playpen; the
costumes could have passed muster for Jack and the Beanstalk. Worst of all,
the action was no naughtier than a Sunday school tea-party. The work cries
out for the irreverent approach of a Jerome Savary. But Panurge is unlikely
to get another chance.
Stronger characterisation of the principals would have helped. The title
role - written, like Don Quichotte, for a basse chantante - requires greater
comic skills than Jean-Philippe Courtis could offer. He was too noble in
bearing, too frayed of voice. Colombe, an unusually down-to-earth Massenet
heroine, was decently sung but unimaginatively acted by Helene Perraguin.
Desmond Byrne's Pantagruel, imprisoned for much of the evening in an outsize
mechanical costume, was a strait-laced master of ceremonies. The casting of
smaller roles was barely adequate.
Saint-Etienne's young music director, Patrick Fournillier, drew much more
secure playing in Le Cid: it was hard to believe that the clarinet obbligato
in the famous soprano aria 'Pleurez, pleurez mes yeux' came from the same
orchestra as the scratchy violin soloist in Panurge. But the chorus was
different - and what a disciplined sound the Lyon Opera chorus made] The
fact that Le Cid was being recorded had clearly influenced the allocation of
rehearsal time.
Based on Corneille's play of love versus honour, Le Cid is a four-act grand
opera in the Meyerbeer tradition, written immediately after Manon and before
Werther. It may lack their intimacy, but it shares their creative vitality.
The concert setting, with only two minor cuts, underlined Massenet's skill
as a musical dramatist: heroic writing for tenor and soprano, atmospheric
choruses, a sense of urgency in the duel scene, and ballet music in the best
French tradition of fake Spanishry - all infused with characteristic
refinement. It was written for first-class voices (the De Reszke brothers
among others), and demands a spectacular staging. Saint-Etienne provided
neither, but somehow got away with it.
Michele Command was the formidable Chimene, a little unyielding in the
gentler moments but rock-steady in attack. Chris Merritt was a
rough-and-ready Rodrigue, lacking the tonal resonance and clarion ease the
part demands. As Don Diegue, Jean-Philippe Courtis was in better voice than
his Panurge 24 hours earlier. Marcel Vanaud was the stentorian king, and the
veteran Gabriel Bacquier made a short but effective contribution as the
Count of Gormas. Maryse Castets's pure soprano was ideal for the Infanta.
Le Cid was preceded by a recital by Didier Henry, the young French baritone
who - like most soloists at the festival - spends most of his time on the
French provincial opera house circuit. His opening Massenet group was marred
by offstage noise and a husky tone quality, but the voice took wing in
Ernest Moret's 'Tu me donnas ton coeur', revealing ample colour and an easy
top. Best of all was the gentle melancholy of Massenet's settings of poems
by Armand Sylvestre, beautifully accompanied by Angeline Pondepeyre.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Suzuki's austere 'Tale of Lear' - Theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese often have a way with Shakespeare. One thinks particularly of
Ninagawa's stage production of Macbeth and Kurosawa's spectacular film Ran,
based on King Lear. Both combined grace with brutality to bring the plays
searingly to life.
Tadashi Suzuki's Tale of Lear (staged at the Barbican as part of the
Everybody's Shakespeare Festival) has the austere beauty you might expect,
but it is equally one of the bleakest versions of Shakespeare's tragedy I
have ever seen. It is cruel, cold and resolutely unmoving.
Suzuki takes as his cue Lear's piteous cry, 'O] let me not be mad, not mad,
sweet heaven', and extrapolates from this a production that draws on the
deep fear we all have of old age, loneliness and dementia. His Lear is not a
king, but a solitary old man in a sanatorium, who is reading the play. He
falls asleep and, as he dreams, the characters in the tragedy melt out of
the walls (literally, it appears, on the ingenious set of sliding doors) to
act the play and suck him into it.
Soon he and Lear are interchangeable and we are not certain whether the
characters are figments of his imagination or other inmates of the asylum.
Suzuki deliberately blurs this distinction by having Edgar creep past in the
background in his Poor Tom rags after the tragedy is over.
The play is distilled to under two hours, the all-male cast acting out only
the harshest points of the plot, and nearly every redeeming feature is cut
out. There is no Kent, and Cordelia makes only the most fleeting of
appearances, so that almost everyone on the stage is either mad or bad. Even
the fool is replaced by a nurse, a sinister, mocking body who seems to
derive a sadistic glee from her charge's distress.
In the confusion as to what is real and what is fantasy, Lear's tormented
rambling about the cruelty of his children expresses the terror and paranoia
that can afflict the elderly. Where Lear delivers his last speech about the
finality of death, staring desperately at the audience, it seems he is
chronicling his own demise and his fear of it, rather than that of his
daughter.
Suzuki infuses his production with traditional Japanese techniques,
perfectly executed. It is statuesque and beautifully lit and the actors,
clad in ornate robes, glide about the stage as though on invisible castors,
or scurry like leaves swept forward by a gust.
Uichiro Fueda as Lear himself moves with such slow, slow fluidity that he
seems pulled by some invisible force. His Lear is grim and grudging, so
unpleasant in his madness that he is not even pitiable. The heightened style
makes it hard to stay engaged at times, and both Goneril and Regan have a
disconcerting habit of cackling manically that puts you in mind of pantomime
villains. For the most part, though, this sombre production is mesmerising -
but it never moves you.
Suzuki has said that he sees the world as a hospital and all its inhabitants
as patients. On the evidence of this production, he holds out little hope
for a cure. As Lear dies on his own, agonised by his ravings and with no
kind words afterwards to take away the sting, Suzuki presents a cold,
comfortless world indeed.

<TEXT>
Television on Friday nights is pretty uninviting these days, unless there
happens to be a good movie somewhere. At present they are tending to turn up
in BBC2's late slot which is linked to the Favourite Films series (9.30).
Choosing his desert island collection today, in the last of the series, is
Clint Eastwood. Among his choices (rightly enough since it inspired Serge
Leone's 'Fistful Of Dollars' and thus virtually created Eastwood's fame) is
Yojimbo. Directed in 1961 by Toshiro Mifune, this is something of a novelty:
a funny samurai film. The fighting man sells his services to both sides in a
village war and casually observes the results (12.15). The other movies are
scarcely worth the time involved, and that goes even for the Marx Brothers'
Big Store, in which Groucho plays a store detective (1.35 C4). As for the
1959 British re-make of The Mummy, it proves what a lot of overblown
nonsense is talked about the 'great days' of Hammer. There is here none of
that sense of style and poignancy which so powerfully characterised the
early Hollywood horror movies (11.40 BBC1).

FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Contemporary and Russian sounds - Concerts in
Barcelona and London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Spanish savings bank 'la Caixa', based in Barcelona, supports a
diversity of concerts, including an early music festival now in its 16th
year, and has just started a contemporary music festival. Looking at once to
international celebrity and local talent, this inaugural venture featured
the music of America's senior composer Elliott Carter (86 in December) and
of the notable Barcelona-born (in 1935) and based composer, Josep Soler.
The first of the concerts I attended was given by the London Sinfonietta and
its new chief conductor Markus Stenz in the Fundacio la Caixa's Centre
Cultural. Carter's 1981 settings for tenor and ensemble of six sonnets by
Robert Lowell, In Sleep, in Thunder (a Sinfonietta commission), came across
in their marvellous intricacy with pungent force if not much tonal beauty, a
lack due not only to the acoustics but to something insistently plain-voiced
about the otherwise impressively deft singer Jon Garrison and to something
stubbornly unlyrical in Carter's nonetheless intelligent vocal writing.
Josep Soler was represented by a short neo-classical concerto for
harpsichord and five instruments which he wrote in 1969 to complement the
famous work by Falla and which the Sinfonietta recorded back in 1976. The
soloist, John Constable, conducting from the keyboard, secured a lively
account of this sweetly bristling 12-tone music, though one discovered from
next evening's concert that the taut idiom no longer reflects Soler's
approach. His Dos poemes per a orquestra (1990-93), performed by the
Orquestra simfonica de Barcelona nacional de Catalunya under Josep Pons,
proved a somewhat neo-romantic affair, the first practically a concerto for
pastoral oboe and rustling curtain of divisi muted strings with unlikely
touches from synthesised organ; the second whipping things up a bit with a
wind machine. Soler's language seems to have become dangerously eclectic,
dicing with kitsch.
The two big movements of Elliott Carter's 1965 piano concerto were complex
not in a playful but a geometrical way; a dense, often dark labyrinth. The
American Ursula Oppens was the staggeringly dauntless, highly experienced
soloist. Pons and the orchestra, with its concertino group gathered round
the piano, performed with truly admirable courage and conviction, though
never approaching an ideal balance of forces and seldom finding the ease and
confidence to animate their jaggedly expressive polyphonic lines rather than
just execute them.
Earlier in the week Oppens gave the Spanish premiere of a five-minute piano
piece, 90+, which Carter recently added to his ongoing series of luminous
little tributes to colleagues, in this case the nonagenarian Italian
composer Goffredo Petrassi. Pitched at a technical level which should not
exclude the gifted amateur, it is a perfect epitome of Carter's dazzling
metrical style and is built on 90 repetitions of the same pulsation, and
then some more, as though to wish Petrassi a few years yet of active life.
One certainly wishes Carter the same: he has just completed an orchestral
piece for next year's Proms and is at work on a voice and piano song-cycle
for next year's Aldeburgh Festival.
***
Russian music of very diverse character was played in two concerts on
consecutive evenings at the Royal Festival Hall by two orchestras, both
conducted by Russians. On Tuesday the Royal Philharmonic under its principal
conductor Yuri Temirkanov gave a neatly contrasted, slightly daring
programme which began with Prokofiev's Suite, Op. 33a from his 1919 opera,
The Love for Three Oranges. These six, wonderfully crisp and witty movements
were executed with panache.
Rachmaninov's three Symphonic Dances Op. 45 of 1941 were brought off well
enough but seemed all the more jadedly conservative with the concert's
marvellous middle item, the Concerto for Piano and Strings (1979) by a
living Russian, Alfred Schnittke, still echoing in the mind. This often
harshly dissonant work, Schnittke's third piano concerto, in this superbly
thoughtful, elegantly shaped, powerful account, with soloist Dmitri Alexeev,
came over as no more alienating than a darker piece by Sir Malcolm Arnold.
The music, like Arnold's, touches on jazz and the RPO's principal double
bass, Jack McCormack, plucked out his cabaret tones with style.
Though the concerto does, indeed, have its violent outbursts, they are only
some of the strangely assorted collection of musical objects - including a
quiet Moonlight Sonata-like triplet figure for piano, a near-pastiche of the
Russian Hymn from the 1812 overture, and a glissandoing string passage -
which Schnittke's apparently zany but actually ironclad argument shows to be
all of a piece. Alexeev and Temirkanov held one enthralled by the music's
sheer dialectic.
On Wednesday the BBC Symphony Orchestra under its principal guest conductor
Alexander Lazarev gave the UK premiere of the single movement Symphony No 7
(1986) by the Armenian composer Alfred Terteryan (born 1929). His music is
folk-influenced in a far from picturesque way. Here he writes an obbligato
part for the folk percussion instrument called the dap' (Timothy Darside),
which sounded not unlike the Indian tabla. This sound was often multiplied
10 or 11 times by the percussion department, or echoed by a tape recording.
A sort of musical prophecy of the Armenian earthquake of 1988, the symphony
deals wholly in monolithic and austere ritual gestures, minimalist in
material whilst maximalist in rhetorical power. A far cry from Schnittke's
irony, but a cry deserving of attention.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Magnesium served up on a plate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK electroplating company believes it has found a method of plating
magnesium which will allow the metal to be used more widely in precision
engineering.
The lightness and strength of the metal makes it an attractive material for
equipment such as portable telephones but its susceptibility to corrosion
has been a serious drawback.
Magnesium's high reactivity has hampered previous efforts to plate the
metal. But Ingram &amp; Glass, a Godalming plating company in conjunction with
PMD (UK), a Coventry chemicals company, has developed a process which
combines electroless nickel technology with magnesium chemistry that permits
the mass production of plated magnesium die-castings.

Compaq Computer, the world's largest personal computer company, has produced
prototype novelty PCs - one called Mr PC Head - in an attempt to increase
sales to home users, writes Geof Wheelwright.
It recently asked a group of seven- and eight-year-old children what they
thought the ideal computer would look like. The result is the Mr PC Head
prototype, which looks like a computer monitor with a face, ears and feet.
Although it may never become a commercial product, the effort demonstrates
how keenly Compaq is studying what it believes is a vast potential consumer
market. It believes that PCs will need to look and operate a lot more like
traditional consumer electronics products if they are to make further
inroads into the home.

<TEXT>
Dutch scientists have bred 'transgenic' mice that are capable of producing
human collagen in their milk.
This development, which was achieved through injecting the relevant gene
into a mouse's fertilised egg, is seen by the researchers as a step towards
their goal of producing human collagen from the milk of transgenic dairy
cattle.
Gene Pharming Europe, a Leiden-based transgenic technology company, working
in partnership with Collagen Corporation of California, believes that
transgenic farming techniques could be a cost-effective method of producing
large volumes of collagen, which is used for the treatment of burns,
fractures and stress incontinence.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Early warning on Alzheimer's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a quarter of cases of Alzheimer's disease are thought to be
incorrectly diagnosed. This disease, which inflicts progressive memory loss
on almost one in 10 people aged over 65, can only be definitively identified
by an examination of brain tissue.
US scientists, writing in today's Science, believe they have found a simple
test for Alzheimer's which would allow it to be detected at an early stage.
They found that patients suspected of having the disease were hypersensitive
to the pupil-dilating effects of tropicamide.
The scientists, who work at Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and Northwestern
University Medical School in Chicago, found that the tropicamide eye-drops,
which were tested on 58 individuals, were 95 per cent accurate in
identifying the diseased patients.
The scientists believe that the tests could identify sufferers before the
onset of symptoms, when they could benefit the most from potential
treatments.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology: Farmers turn to genetic control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The farming industry could be on the brink of an important development in
pest and disease control that would boost production levels to new heights.
Gene transfer technology may be on the market in the next few years, but its
success depends largely on public acceptance.
Scientists are using biotechnology methods to create insect and disease-free
versions of widely consumed crops such as maize and wheat. Species that are
resistant to specific insects and diseases have been developed by Micogen,
Pioneer Hi-Bred, Monsanto, Ciba, Hoechst, Schering and others. Applications
to get some of these products on the market are now before the US
Environmental Protection Agency.
The Food and Drug Administration in Washington said earlier this month that
it would not oppose the development of two pest-resistant crops, a
virus-resistant squash (marrow) developed by Asgrow and a beetle-resistant
potato from Monsanto. These still have to win approval from the EPA, but it
is a step towards the market place.
If all goes well, the market could be vast. US farmers alone spend about
Dollars 600m (Pounds 366m) a year to combat pests and diseases in plants.
Much of that money could in the future go to biotechnology.
But the industry is concerned that public opposition could slow the process.
Americans are believed to be open to the idea of transgenic crops, but
scientists say their acceptance is far from guaranteed. Many Americans
oppose the transgenic Calgene tomato which was approved by the FDA a few
months ago.
Ironically, the surge in opposition to genetically engineered food products
comes as the EPA is hoping to encourage use of transgenics in farming. The
agency believes biotechnology can cut the use of chemical pesticides, which
are of increasing concern. On the back of recent research illuminating the
profound health risks of pesticides, the EPA announced this month it would
consider outlawing a number of chemicals.
Transgenic disease-resistant crops are created by splicing a specific gene
into a plant. The gene causes the plant to produce enzymes which protect it
from predators. Proponents of the technology say it is more effective than
pesticides, since the entire plant is immunised.
The main environmental concern of the transgenic crops is that their
widespread use could cause insects and diseases to become rapidly resistant
themselves. Under normal circumstances, pests gradually build up immunities
to chemicals and other products. Because the transgenic crops are so
efficient, environmentalists say, this process may be accelerated.
Although this is a risk, Elizabeth Milewski, a special assistant for
biotechnology at the EPA believes the new technology should be pursued
enthusiastically. 'These transgenic plants fall into what we call the
low-risk category. They can be much safer than pesticide-treated crops.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Technology: Nothing left to luck - Operators of the UK's
first national lottery believe they have ruled out system mishaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the UK's national lottery is launched next week, the winning numbers
will be picked by a mechanical structure resembling a Perspex cement mixer.
It is virtually the only low-tech aspect of the lottery, which will use a
sophisticated infrastructure of terminals, network and processors to deal
with up to 15m transactions an hour.
Although the equipment has mostly been tried elsewhere, its quantity and the
short time available for its installation have won the lottery a place in
the record books. Over the past 25 weeks, members of the Camelot consortium,
which runs the lottery, have worked flat out to manufacture and install
10,000 lottery terminals, set up the communications network and train nearly
35,000 retail staff.
The most visible part of the system is the retailers' terminals, which scan
customers' gamecards and print out the tickets that must be presented to
claim any winnings.
The terminals, 27,000 of which should be installed by the end of 1996, have
been designed by GTech, the US lottery operator and member of the Camelot
consortium. It used a 10-year-old design, which has been upgraded by the
addition of a liquid crystal display panel and a device to read bar codes on
the tickets. GTech says the technology is tried and tested. 'The design was
already done, the technology was in place. The challenge was just the scale
of the system,' says Don Stanford, senior vice-president for technology.
Bob King of ICL, which built and installed the terminals, agrees. 'The
complexity simply comes from the very short timescale involved. The actual
making of the terminal and installation of the terminal is straightforward,'
he says.
Racal, responsible for linking the terminals with the lottery processing
centres at Rickmansworth, outside London, and Aintree, in the north-west of
England, has also used relatively old technology. 'The timescale was
extremely aggressive. You could not afford any new design or risky
technology in case there was a hiccup,' says Steve Hodson, executive
technical manager.
The data will be transmitted using the X25 communications standard on what
will be the UK's largest private terminal/host network. This is an upgraded
version of a six-year-old network which connects government offices around
the country.
Racal, which has added 25 per cent of extra capacity to the network,
believes the two uses of the network will complement each other. For
instance, the peak lottery traffic on Saturday afternoons will coincide with
a low point in government activity.
Not all retailers will be connected to the central processors by landlines.
In less populated areas, some 5,500 retailers will use satellite dishes,
served initially by Eutelsat and eventually by Orion.
Accuracy, security and robustness have all been important considerations in
building the network. Racal is confident that no one can be cheated of their
lottery winnings through an error in the transmission of the data. 'The
chance of getting an error is infinitesimally small,' says Hodson.
Likewise, Camelot says it is satisfied that its software incorporates
adequate security devices to prevent hackers from breaking into the system.
The designers of the system have also tried to ensure that it can cope with
the failure of processors or cables. If one processor fails, the
Rickmansworth and Aintree sites between them have three other processors
that could act as back-ups.
It also has tried to ensure that a failed line will not disrupt the lottery.
At Rickmansworth, Mercury and BT have five different cables running into the
building through separate ducts. As the system fans out to the retailers,
only the last mile of cabling lacks the back-up of a second line. 'It is a
balance of cost against reliability,' says Hodson.
It may take years before the system shows itself able to cope with all
contingencies. But next week will provide the system's first and most
challenging test. Camelot claims to be confident, as a result of its past
experience with the technology. Unlike its customers, it trusts that nothing
has been left to luck.

FT  11 NOV 94 / People: CEGB sparks de Sausmarez' investment career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Electricity Generating Board would not seem to be the best
starting block for a career in fund management. But it doesn't seem to have
hampered the rapid rise of James de Sausmarez who has just got the job of
running Henderson Administration's retail division.
De Sausmarez, 35, joined the Touche Remnant investment trust group from the
CEGB as company secretary in 1986 and was not appointed a manager in the
investment trust department until April 1990.
Following Henderson's acquisition of TR in December 1992, de Sausmarez was
put in charge of the combined Henderson Touche Remnant Investment Trust
operation and has been responsible for the rapid growth of one of the more
successful parts of Henderson's Pounds 13.7bn fund management business.
In some respects de Sausmarez is following in the footsteps of Paul Manduca,
42, the former head of Touche Remnant who was made managing director of
Henderson's retail business following the takeover just under two years ago.
Six months ago Manduca quit to head Threadneedle Asset Management. De
Sausmarez will have the same title as Manduca but he has not been given a
seat on the board and will not be in charge of Henderson's private client
operations. He will remain in charge of Henderson's Pounds 3.7bn investment
trust business and is adding overall responsibility for the Pounds 1.4bn
unit trust operation headed by Richard Eats.
Despite de Sausmarez's rapid rise, it is understood that he is unlikely to
follow in Manduca's footsteps as the heir apparent to Jeremy Edwards, 57,
Henderson's managing director who is expected to retire within the next two
years. Henderson is understood to be looking outside for Edwards'
replacement.
David Watson, 35, formerly director, finance, at NatWest Securities, has
been appointed to the same job at the M &amp; G Group. It is not a board
appointment but Watson will be the group's senior financial officer.
Caroline Baker, 40, head of personnel at Towers Perrin, Tillinghast, has
been appointed head of personnel at M &amp; G.

FT  11 NOV 94 / People: More bang for 'pretty boxes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Mottershead, 47, the former chief executive of Prontaprint, has been
given the job of putting the bang back into the UK business of Bang &amp;
Olufsen, the 70-year-old Danish family firm which makes specialist TV and
audio products.
Bang &amp; Olufsen, a minnow in a market dominated by multinationals, made a
name for itself because of its flair for design and clever technology.
However, the company lost its way at the end of the 1980s and sales in the
UK, which was once the company's biggest overseas market, have fallen by
around two thirds from a peak of around Pounds 40m a year.
Just over three years ago a new management team took over in Denmark and the
company's fortunes have been recovering. Mottershead, who started out as a
Cadbury Schweppes' brand manager, believes that Bang &amp; Olufsen's problems in
the UK stem from a perception that its products are 'very high-priced and
too design-orientated'. There is a lot more to the group than 'pretty
boxes', says Mottershead.
While most of Bang &amp; Olufsen's competitors concentrate on volume and prices,
Mottershead believes that the key to success is to use the combination of
the Danish firm's technical innovation and styling to promote 'life style'
products.
Mottershead, a former chairman of the British Franchise Association, joined
Prontaprint, the Darlington-based print and business service franchiser, in
1987 and doubled turnover over the next four years. The company was taken
over the following year and in September 1992 Mottershead led a management
buy-out. He resigned as chairman and managing director of Prontaprint in
August 1993 because he says that he was fed up with commuting between two
homes at either end of the country.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Property: Looser lease terms - Calls for an industry-wide
code of practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a secret meeting at the Department of the Environment last week,
representatives of property owners, tenants and the professions started
discussions aimed at changing the face of commercial leases.
Although the government said in July that it would not use legislation to
abolish established practices such as upward only rent reviews and
confidentiality clauses, Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, called on
the industry to encourage flexibility on lease terms.
While many property owners hoped that the minister's statement would be the
end of the matter, last week's meeting proves that the issue of lease reform
is very much alive in the corridors of power.
This should not come as a surprise. In July, Mr Baldry said that the
government would look again at the operation of commercial leases in three
years' time to see if the property industry had put its own house in order.
Given the state of the opinion polls and with a general election due by
1997, that might seem like an idle threat. But there is every chance that an
incoming Labour government would see political advantage in championing the
tenants' cause.
So what exactly does the government want? Mr Baldry's July statement gives
some clues. The minister called for an industry-wide code of practice which
would draw attention to the implications of upward only rent reviews and
encourage flexibility on other terms.
The code should also encourage greater openness - presumably by discouraging
confidentiality clauses, which prevent tenants sharing information on rents
 -unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.
Above all, a code of practice should lead to a change of behaviour in the
marketplace.
The British Property Federation, which represents large landlords, has
already taken the initiative by proposing a code which would remind tenants
of their rights and draw attention to the possibility of negotiating
different terms.
Mr Roger Carey, BPF president, said: 'A 'health warning' of this kind would
be very valuable and would do much to promote the flexibility in lease terms
sought by tenants. Very importantly, it would not make the mistake of trying
to interfere in the position of the parties but would leave them free to
negotiate within prevailing market conditions.'
The BPF argues that anything more prescriptive than this would alienate
landlords.
'A Code of Practice which is not acceptable to owners will not be used and
the whole issue will go back into the melting pot,' Carey said.
But neither is it clear that a health warning would have much impact on
market behaviour, in which case the government could simply return with
legislation in three years' time.
The question is whether the BPF's proposals simply need to be strengthened
or whether the code of practice needs to be more prescriptive.
The tenants' side of the argument is put forcefully by the British Retail
Consortium. Mr James May, director general, argues that landlords are in a
much stronger position when negotiating with retail tenants than with office
or industrial occupiers.
'The retail market is different because location is so much more important.
Retailers need to be in certain prime locations of which there is limited
supply often in the hands of a single owner. In these situations the balance
of power is tilted too far in favour of the landlord,' he said.
The BRC's argument is that retail landlords can be in a monopoly position,
owning the prime sites in a particular high street or shopping centre. In
such circumstances market forces do not operate effectively.
Retailers would like more flexibility on the lease terms that landlords are
prepared to accept. That might include more rents linked to turnover, upward
and downward rent reviews, and shorter leases.
'If we have to pay higher rents for more flexible terms so be it,' said Mr
May.
The BRC would like a code of practice which encourages a greater range of
lease options for tenants and believes that something stronger than a health
warning is required.
The interests of small business - landlords and tenants - also have to be
taken into account. It is often the case that small landlords rely on a
long-term secure income almost like a pension. Forcing these owners to
accept more flexible lease terms could have an unpalatable side-effects.
The professional bodies such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
and the Law Society are caught in the middle of this argument. The
institution, in particular, has to represent the interests of landlords,
tenants and their professional advisers.
Mr Richard Lay, chairman of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, the surveyors, and the
institution's commercial property spokesman, said: 'The government
instructed the industry to do something out of the blue. The first step is
to try to decide what is achievable on the landlords' side and what is
acceptable to the tenants.'
The question is whether the legitimate interest of all landlords in a secure
income can be squared with the desire of tenants for greater diversity of
lease terms without an element of compulsion.
Shorter, more flexible leases became widely available through recession as
landlords found their bargaining position weakened. The traditional 25-year
'institutional' lease has been reduced to 15 years or less.
Mr Baldry appeared to acknowledge as much in July, when he said: 'It is
evident that the market is now providing a greater variety of lease terms .
. . especially the availability of short leases'.
The danger is that leases will become longer and less flexible as the
economy improves and the balance of power tilts back in favour of landlords
to a degree that the government views as unacceptable.
Despite taking a hard line in public, many big landlords recognise that they
may have to give away slightly more than the BPF's 'health warning' proposal
to avoid legislation. It is now up to tenants to articulate more clearly
what kind of code of practice they would like.

FT  11 NOV 94 / People: Lloyds; limbering up in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time was when the Bank of London and South America was one of the biggest
names around in Latin American banking. No longer. And Latin America was one
region of the world where its successor - Lloyds Bank - has retained a
significant presence as it pulled in its horns elsewhere to concentrate on
the British market. It and its subsidiaries and affiliates still employ
3,600 people in the region.
For most of the debt-distressed 1980s, however, it was a case of slimming
down and staying put. Now, with hopes growing about the region's economic
prospects, the bank is thinking about moderate expansion.
The two people charged with this are Freddy Gibbs (above left), a banker of
35 years' standing who is based in Sao Paulo, where he'll stay to be general
manager of the bank's Latin America southern region. He will be responsible
for the bank's operations in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay and
keep an eye of Chile, Peru and Bolivia.
In Argentina, where the bank has been operating for 130 years, the bank
employs about 800 people, the same number as work in Brazil - where Lloyds
also has a 51 per cent stake in the wholesale bank, Multiplic.
Alexander Ashton (near left), a Lloyds banker since 1972 with experience in
Europe and the Middle East, takes over the northern region and will be based
in London. He will be responsible for the bank's operations in Honduras,
Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador and Colombia. 'One thing we hope to do is get
more involved in the financing of trade within the region which is growing
quickly but quietly at the moment,' he says.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Go away, Sir John - How do you respond to the
advice of a troubleshooter? James Buxton looks at the case of Charles Letts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When former company doctor Bill Gore became chief executive at the diary
maker Charles Letts last year, the problems he was to tackle were already
known in outline to several million people.
A few months earlier Sir John Harvey-Jones, former ICI chairman-turned
business guru, had breezed through the company in his popular Troubleshooter
2 television series as well as devoting a chapter of a book to it.
Harvey-Jones had been called in by the Letts family (which then controlled
the company) after it plunged heavily into loss in 1991. He examined its
core diary publishing business and concluded it suffered from excess costs
and too little capital, and was split inefficiently between a sales team in
London and the printing plant at Dalkeith near Edinburgh.
As for the company's diversification into book publishing, the division
required more capital than Letts could afford and should be sold.
All this was pungently conveyed to the urbane but wincing owners and
managers of Letts in an agonising televised session. Later Harvey-Jones
lamented to the camera that the Letts management 'have taken some actions,
but not the ones that I would wish them to. I don't think that the family
are yet sufficiently worried to take the actions I think they should.'
That was in December 1992. The dramatic (but untelevised) sequel was that
within weeks Letts' bankers Hambros, which had been supporting the business
with loans and preference shares, lost confidence in the company's
management under Anthony Letts, chairman from the sixth generation of the
family.
Gore was asked by Letts' accountants at the time, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to draw
up a recovery programme. In June 1993, at the insistence of Hambros and 3i,
which had an equity stake in Letts, he became chief executive.
The company was supported at the end of 1993 by a refinancing package worth
Pounds 16m which came from Hambros, Morgan Grenfell, 3i and the new
management. The Letts family's stake was drastically cut from 58 per cent to
15 per cent.
Gore had not seen the Troubleshooter programme - and took took care not to
watch the video so that he would be able to make up his own mind. But he too
decided that many of the company's recent efforts to restore profitability
amounted only to tinkering. He reckoned Letts had 'a good wide customer base
and a good name, but an excess of costs and an excess of unnecessary
activity'. However, he did not do everything Harvey-Jones suggested.
One glaring source of excess costs was never identified as a problem by
Harvey-Jones, even though he was often filmed visiting it - the company's
stylish headquarters in Battersea, which was costing Pounds 1m a year in
rent.
'I regarded that as fundamental,' says Gore. He quickly struck a deal with
the landlord under which the building was leased to a new tenant at no cost
to Letts and the remaining staff moved to Dalkeith.
Like Harvey-Jones, Gore focused on the books publishing business and decided
it had been rendered unviable by the sale in 1992 of its profitable line of
examination revision guides, leaving a range of lifestyle books without the
revenue to meet overheads. The division was sold at the end of 1993.
A recurrent theme of the TV programme was that Letts should sell Mayfair
Trunks, a shop in London that sells luxury goods. It was small but losing
money, did not sell many Letts products and should not have been acquired,
Harvey-Jones said.
But Letts has not sold Mayfair Trunks. 'It is not draining cash and we have
cut the staff to two,' Gore says. 'It's not worth spending management time
on it. When rents improve we will find a good home for it.'
Across the organisation Gore has trimmed surplus layers of management,
shedding staff in the process. Of the three executives from the Letts
family, all in their late 50s, Martin Letts and his cousin Timothy retired,
while Anthony moved, 'after some quite fundamental discussions', from being
executive to non-executive chairman and stepped down last August, remaining
a director. Charles Letts, another family member, is a management trainee.
Staff were also cut in the US, where Letts distributes diaries. Initially
the new management attempted to diversify into producing corporate gifts, an
idea proposed by Harvey-Jones, but it has since changed its mind and pulled
out of that operation.
The most important part of the business is the diary operation, which claims
a quarter of the UK diary market but was, Gore says, under-performing and
inflexible. The production process for printing standard diaries was too
slow and it was taking too long to design and manufacture customised diaries
for corporate clients.
Gore praises the GMBU general union at Dalkeith for understanding 'the
commercial realities of life' and abandoning the annual three-week works
shutdown in midsummer, switching to staggered holidays and a system of
working 30-hour weeks in the first half of the year and 45-hour weeks in the
second half.
Production staff were put into small groups to analyse problems. 'We
identified the main problem as the slowness of changing plates in the
presses at the end of a print run. We have now got that down by half,
cutting the total production time by 25 per cent,' Gore says.
Reflecting the slimmer company, turnover on continuing activities dropped
from Pounds 30m in 1993 to Pounds 23.6m in the year to January 1994. A loss
of Pounds 7.5m was reduced to Pounds 785,000. It made an operating profit of
Pounds 2.2m.
In retrospect Gore feels Harvey-Jones's investigation was a mixed blessing.
It focused the attention of management and unions, and of the banks and
investors, on the need for something to be done, and 'helped identify the
real problems'. But, as a result of the programme, 'our customers withdrew a
little bit (out of nervousness about the company's future) and certainly
didn't come up with new proposals. And our sales force was left a little
dead in the water'. In fact, he says: 'I'd like to see that man go away.'
It's the sort of bluntness Harvey-Jones would respect.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Management: Guidelines for safety - A look at ways to combat
violence in the workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British employers are neglecting their duty to prevent violence at work, a
national charity which specialises in personal safety issues claimed this
week.
Under the 1974 Health and Safety Act and the 1992 Health &amp; Safety at Work
Regulations, companies are legally required to carry out assessments and
establish agreed procedures for all types of risk.
According to the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, however, 'what actually happens is
that risk assessment tends to be carried out only for industrial accidents
involving machinery or toxic substances; employers do not recognise that
personal attacks on staff should be included in this process'.
In a bid to raise employer awareness the trust has just published guidance
notes aimed at reducing the risks of violence and aggression at work. They
have been formally endorsed by the government's Health &amp; Safety Executive,
the Confederation of British Industry and the TUC.
Until the HSE incorporates violent incidents at work into the revised
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurences Regulations the
extent of the problem will be unclear. But the trust believes that workplace
violence is increasing faster than violent crime in general and estimates
that there are an average of 35,000 incidents per year, three quarters of
them assaults on staff by the public.
The guide argues that both employers and employees have a common interest in
reducing violence, citing the impact on morale, image and recruitment. 'It
can also mean extra costs, with absenteeism, higher insurance premiums and
compensation payments.'
Risk assessment is summarised in five steps: look for the hazards; classify
all incidents; search for preventative measures, deciding whether existing
precautions are adequate; create a company policy and procedures and put it
into practice; check that the measures work - review and, if necessary,
revise the assessment from time to time.
The trust warns that self-defence courses 'need to be viewed with great
caution'. They need to be well taught though 'however much training a person
is given there will always be times when that person is not on top form'.
Avoidance is the best option: 'In any violent physical contact everyone will
be hurt and if an employee responds with active aggression he or she may
risk a counter claim of assault.'

combat violence in the workplace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Workplace violence is escalating rapidly in the US. In California alone,
workplace homicides surged from 159 deaths in 1992 to 195 last year, and the
final tally for 1994 is likely to be even higher.
Ironically, the epidemic of violence has spread as the total number of
workplace fatalities has diminished.
'We've become good at preventing death in other categories such as contact
with hazardous chemicals and falls,' says John Howard, director of the
California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Calosha). 'But
violence is still a big concern.'
Homicide accounts for 17 per cent of all workplace fatalities in the
country, just behind motor vehicle accidents, according to the Bureau for
Labour Statistics. The National Occupational Safety and Health
Administration says it is working on recommendations to counteract the
problem.
Although the US media has recently highlighted violent acts by disgruntled
employees, most incidents occur during rob-beries.
'These workplace risks have been ignored in the past because they are seen
as part of a larger crime problem,' says Guy Toscano, an economist with the
US Department of Labour. 'But they are so big we must pay attention to
them.'
Taxicab drivers are murdered at higher rates than workers in other
professions, accounting for 26.9 per cent of the US total, according to the
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (Niosh).
Liquor store workers are next in line, accounting for 8 per cent. Other
risky places to earn a living are petrol stations, detective services,
grocery stores, jewellery stores, hotels, restaurants and bars.
Non-fatal assaults also plague American workers. More than 670,000 Americans
were assaulted at their place of employment in 1992, according to the
National Crime Victimisation Survey, and the figure represents about 11 per
cent of all violent crimes in the US.
'Besides the risk to workers, these incidents affect businesses because of
missed work and decreased productivity,' says Howard. A substantial number
of victims are carers in nursing homes and hospitals. They are usually
injured by their patients.
Niosh and Calosha guidelines advise stores to keep their car parks as
brightly lit as the local law allows, to post signs that a limited amount of
cash is on hand, and to install silent alarms.
They suggest that employers in health care and other service industries
instruct workers in how to defuse hostile situations involving patients or
clients, to install alarm systems or panic buttons as a back-up and to
consider establishing a buddy system or hiring security personnel.
Workplace crimes of passion by disgruntled employees, or a worker's spouse,
friend or lover are not as common as other assaults. But Calosha recommends
that employers look for tell-tale signs that a person may become violent and
ensure that employees with severe emotional problems have someone to turn
to, such as a staff psychologist.
Offices should be closed late at night and early in the morning (most
attacks occur between 6pm and 10am). Employees should be discouraged from
working in offices alone, and employers should encourage female employees to
let them know if they are being stalked.

FT  11 NOV 94 / MPs to probe failed hospital: Founder denies that Scottish
healthcare project was flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government funding for Health Care International, the private hospital which
went into receivership on Wednesday only four months after opening, is to be
investigated by the Commons' public accounts committee.
This follows a request to the committee last month from Mr George Robertson,
shadow Scottish secretary, for an urgent inquiry into why Pounds 30m of
public money had been committed to what he described as a 'shaky' project.
Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour chairman of the committee, said it would meet soon
to decide how to carry out the investigation.
The public funds offered to HCI included Pounds 22m in regional selective
assistance, part of which had not been disbursed. Scottish Enterprise, the
development body, had lent HCI Pounds 4m and invested Pounds 1.4m.
The joint receivers, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur
Andersen, were called in on Wednesday after the French bank Credit Lyonnais
refused to accept a refinancing package for the hospital, which hit cash
flow problems because of a shortage of overseas patients.
Yesterday Dr Raphael Levey, one of the US founders of HCI, denied that the
concept of HCI was flawed. Its cash flow needs had initially exceeded
'patient flows' but in recent days it had been achieving a rate of
admissions that would have assured its viability.
'If we had had a bit more time and a bit more cash this catastrophe would
not have happened,' he said. The bank which had refused to continue
supporting the project was the one that was 'least close to the project'.
Some hopes for the hospital's future are being pinned on the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority which owns 5 per cent of HCI's ordinary shares, and had
been prepared to put more equity into it before the company went into
receivership. HCI believes Abu Dhabi could also assure a substantial flow of
patients to the hospital.
Yesterday Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, rejected criticism that Labour's
stance over HCI was based on dogma.
He said: 'The dogma lay with Conservative ministers who were determined to
plough so much money into a highly questionable and risky project.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Court of Appeal setback for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS INSURANCE CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Court of Appeal ruling yesterday threatened to undermine efforts by
Lloyd's to collect more than Pounds 1bn owed by loss-making members and to
create confusion about the legal status of some of the insurance market's
practices.
If the case is not resolved soon Lloyd's could find it harder to pass
solvency tests required by regulators.
Hard-hit Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the
market - welcomed the court's verdict that Lloyd's might have broken
European competition law, in particular by asking them to contribute to a
'central fund' while underwriting. The central fund is used to settle claims
on policies underwritten by Lloyd's when Names refuse, or are unable, to
provide the funds required and also to ensure the market passes UK
government solvency rules.
The court also raised a question mark over whether Lloyd's practice of
encourag-ing the reinsurance of its policies within the market might also
have breached Euro-pean Union competition law.
The decision, overturning a lower court's ruling, could affect Lloyd's
attempts to recover Pounds 1.2bn earmarked from the central fund (and other
assets) to cover possible liabilities on policies underwritten by Names. It
will give aggrieved members an excuse not to pay sums demanded by Lloyd's at
least until the arguments are considered in a full court trial - possibly
not until next autumn. If the central fund is declared void, that would
raise the question of whether Lloyd's should repay money paid into the fund.
However, Lloyd's said it would continue its debt recovery operation and
planned an early appeal to the Lords. It pointed out that the court had been
considering only preliminary issues and had not taken a view on whether
Lloyd's had contravened European law.
Lloyd's is also applying to Brussels for the necessary exemptions from
European law to clarify the position.
The Names' Writs Response Group argued that because the Lloyd's market
comprised an 'association of undertakings', arrangements made centrally
could amount to a cartel agreement under the Treaty of Rome. This is
because, by offering buyers of Lloyd's policies extra protection, they may
have given the market an unfair advantage over outside reinsurance
companies.
For many years Lloyd's had intended to check the arrangements with the
European Community but it never actually took that step.
Mr Alan Porter, chairman of the Devonshire Names Action Group, a group of
loss-making members, said: 'The judgment must cast further serious doubt on
whether Lloyd's should continue to trade.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Silver soup tureens fetch glittering price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pair of elaborate 18th century silver tureens sold for just over Pounds 1m
at Sotheby's yesterday, Antony Thorncroft writes.
It was an auction record for English tureens, and Sotheby's said the tureens
 -made in 1744 for Henry Bromley, 1st Baron Montfort - were the most
important items of English silver to be offered at auction for a decade.
The buyer was anonymous, but Arab collectors have recently acquired many
similar examples of ornate silver.
The tureens - which each weigh 16lbs - were designed by Palladian architect
William Kent and made by goldsmith George Wickes. Their most distinctive
feature is handles in the form of horses' heads. The tureens cost Henry
Bromley Pounds 500.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Lords plan register of interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords is considering opening a register of members' interests
to bring peers into line with the Commons after allegations of impropriety
against MPs.
The proposals, prompted by the prime minister's Commons statement on
standards of public life, are being drawn up by the powerful Lords procedure
committee, which sets guidelines for the conduct of business in the House.
The committee, chaired by Lord Ampthill, a crossbencher, is expected to
receive a report shortly from Sir Michael Wheeler-Booth, clerk of the House,
on the practicalities of setting up a register.
However, a register could be established only after a vote on the floor of
the House. It would probably be supported by most Labour and Liberal
Democrat peers, but might face opposition from Conservative backwoodsmen -
peers who do not attend the House regularly. Peers say that such a big
constitutional innovation would probably have to be decided on a free vote,
which would mean that party leaders would have little control over the
outcome.
Viscount Cranborne, leader of the Lords, was not available for comment on
the proposed register. However, he told peers last month that 'in view of
the current climate, it is clearly right that the question should be
examined again'.
Much of the impetus for the register has come from Lord Richard, Labour's
leader in the Lords, who has also pressed for the upper house to be subject
to oversight by the new standing committee on public standards, chaired by
Lord Nolan.
Lord Richard said: 'As far as we are concerned, this is something that ought
to be pressed. Standards in the Lords should be the same as the standards in
the Commons, and that would include a register of the interests of members.'
However, peers point out that the unelected House faces special problems
compiling a register. One senior peer said: 'All that could really be done
would be to withdraw the party whip, which would not worry most peers too
much. Quite a lot of active peers are crossbenchers anyway.
'Things are really more casual up here than they are in the Commons. It is
not a just question of peers being employed by consultancies, it is that so
many have outside interests of their own.
'People usually declare specific interests, but if you own half of Scotland
you have an interest in almost everything that is debated. A register would
not solve the problem, but it would make things more transparent.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / CDs push down vinyl disc sales to 3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compact discs have driven down the UK market share of music recorded on
vinyl to little more than 3 per cent in 12 years, says a study from the
Datamonitor market research consultancy.
In 1982, when compact discs were launched, 65 per cent of recorded music
sales were on vinyl discs.
Datamonitor predicts that vinyl will 'soon be a thing of the past'. Most big
music companies and retailers no longer make or sell albums or singles on
vinyl, now restricted to a cult market of disc jockeys and collectors.
Sales of CDs have risen almost as quickly as those of vinyl have fallen.
After five years on the market, CDs represented 12.6 per cent of recording
sales in 1987 and claimed 60.5 per cent last year. Audio cassettes accounted
for 36.3 per cent of the market last year.
Datamonitor believes CDs will continue to gain share because only 37 per
cent of UK homes have a CD player. Future sales will be stimulated as more
households buy players and replace their old vinyl record collections with
CDs.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Truck sales help lift commercial vehicle figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New commercial vehicle registrations rose by 15.1 per cent last month to
18,590, helped by a big increase in truck sales.
In sharp contrast to recent trends in the UK market for new cars, where
registrations fell by 3 per cent last month, demand for new commercial
vehicles has remained strong since the summer.
In the first 10 months of the year, new commercial vehicle registrations
increased by 15.5 per cent to 195,540, according to figures released by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, compared with a rise of 8.5 per
cent in registrations of new cars.
Sales of new trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) jumped by 58.7
per cent in October to 4,545, although the size of the increase was
exaggerated by changes in truck exhaust emission regulations introduced a
year ago. Tougher rules were introduced at the start of October 1993, which
had the effect of pulling registrations forward into September last year.
The truck sector has led the commercial vehicle market out of recession with
registrations rising by 20.6 per cent in the first 10 months of the year to
36,568.
Sales of heavy trucks (above 15 tonnes), most importantly to long distance
hauliers and to the construction industry, have achieved the strongest
growth with registrations increasing by 27.7 per cent in the first 10
months.
European truckmakers have intensified their marketing efforts in the UK,
where the rate of growth has been higher than in most continental European
markets with the result that truck imports are rising rapidly.
Imports accounted for 58.5 per cent of the UK truck market in the first 10
months of the year compared with 49 per cent in the corresponding period a
year ago. Registrations of imported trucks rose by 43.9 per cent compared
with an increase of 20.6 per cent in overall truck sales.
Renault - albeit from a small base - Daf and Scania have all gained ground
in the UK market for heavy trucks.
Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy and the overall
leader of the UK truck market, has suffered a significant loss of market
share to 22.6 per cent from 24.7 per cent a year ago.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Lady Porter lawyer says gerrymander charge 'was absurd'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A district auditor was wrong to use the word 'gerrymandering' when he
accused Westminster City Council's former Conservative leader Dame Shirley
Porter of mis-using public money, her lawyer claimed at a public inquiry
yesterday.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC was defending Dame Shirley against accusations from
Mr John Magill, district auditor, that she and nine others sold off council
homes to people who they believed were likely to vote Conservative.
Mr Scrivener said it was 'absurd' to call it gerrymandering because there
was no way of guaranteeing that the buyers would vote - let alone that they
would vote Conservative. 'This was not gerrymandering,' he said. 'I can
hardly imagine a more emotive word to hit the headlines.'
At the start of the public inquiry, Dame Shirley tried to get Mr Magill
removed from the case because he had used such a term when presenting his
provisional report in January to a televised press conference. She claimed
it had prejudiced her defence.
Mr Scrivener said he appreciated it would be difficult for Mr Magill 'to
retreat from your high point' after the views had attracted so much
publicity. 'But I hope that you will have the strength to do just that,' he
said.
Mr Scrivener also argued that Mr Jeremy Sullivan, a leading QC, had approved
the scheme to sell the homes before it had been passed in July 1987. Mr
Scrivener said Dame Shirley attached great importance to obtaining legal
approval for her policies as council leader.
He added that if the district auditor stuck to his report, it would be the
first time that councillors would be surcharged after obtaining legal
approval from independent counsel.
Mr Scrivener criticised Mr Magill for going further than any other district
auditor when he sought and seized papers arising out of closed meetings of
Tory councillors. He alleged that Mr Magill had 'feasted' on these political
papers and had used them to back his accusations of gerrymandering. Mr
Scrivener did not deny these papers existed.
He told the inquiry: 'What was said in these meetings is one thing. It does
not mean that councillors forget their duties when they go into the council
chamber. If the district auditor is right, I can imagine that all the
shredders in councils around the country would be working overtime.'
The inquiry was adjourned until Tuesday.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Private finance scheme to shift up a gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of the government's private finance initiative will accelerate over
the coming year, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the government's private
finance panel, said yesterday.
He identified a number of new areas where the initiative might be applied
and warned City institutions interested in participating in schemes that
they would be expected to share the risks.
There was no benefit to government in replacing public funds with a
straightforward lease which simply spread out payments. Sir Alastair said:
'The one thing the City is not going to get is finance leases dressed up
with a government guarantee and carrying a padded project management fee. We
won't wear that.'
He said the initiative, which was launched two years ago, had been slow to
start, but resistance in the Treasury and other government departments was
being overcome and a large number of potential projects with a total value
of Pounds 10bn had been identified.
Sir Alastair said: 'After a lot of wheel-spinning there is a momentum which
will produce a lot of done deals within the next six to nine months. I am
now more concerned about whether we can handle the amount of work than the
need to get things going.'
He was speaking two days after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, unveiled
plans to force Whitehall departments to seek outside funding for all capital
spending. The panel, which first met last December, was set up to
co-ordinate the private finance initiative and to encourage proposals.
Among new sectors identified by Mr Morton were:
Information technology programmes to transfer paper-based administration
systems in government departments to computers. Applications include the
Land Registry and Post Office Counters. Projects worth more than Pounds 1bn
are being studied.
Projects in the state-owned water and sewerage industries in Scotland and
Northern Ireland, with a potential value of Pounds 1.2bn.
The further education sector and grant maintained schools should be allowed
private finance on a par with the higher education sector.
Local authorities would be allowed to involve private finance under
proposals currently out for consultation. State-owned organisations such as
London Underground, Railtrack and the Post Office could buy in many
services. Sir Alistair asked: 'Does London Underground need to own the pumps
which keep its tunnels dry, electricity power stations, its escalators and
pits signalling?'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Pounds 1/4 m pay-offs on offer as 700 health jobs go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some senior Department of Health civil servants will qualify for financial
packages of up to Pounds 250,000 under proposals for job cuts announced
yesterday.
About 500 posts are to be abolished in the department's London offices and
another 200 at the National Health Service executive headquarters in Leeds -
a 21 per cent reduction in the number of staff responsible for the central
administration of health and social services.
Job losses will affect all levels of staff, including the most senior.
Staff had been aware that jobs were to go since July, when the government
published two reports proposing a more streamlined central structure now
that the delivery of NHS services is managed locally.
Although employees did not know the scale of the proposed job losses until
announcements were made to meetings in London and Leeds yesterday, details
of voluntary severance arrangements were outlined three weeks ago.
The department said it had already received 200 serious inquiries about the
scheme, which will remain open until January. Compulsory redundancies have
not been ruled out if there are insufficient volunteers.
From next April the department will be reorganised around the three main
responsibilities of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary - the NHS,
local authority and voluntary social services, and public health. More
flexible structures and more team working are planned.
Mr Graham Hart, the department's permanent secretary, said the changes would
lead to the central department doing 'only what must be done at the centre'.
Other work would be cut out or devolved to local level.
The job cuts, part of a wider Whitehall drive to reduce bureaucracy, are in
addition to the shake-out in regional health authorities. About 1,500
regional posts have already gone, and a similar number are scheduled to be
eliminated by 1996.
A quarantine period will be applied to civil servants leaving the department
or executive, restricting their ability to take on other health service jobs
for 12 months.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Barings office deal raises City benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings, the merchant bank and securities house, has signed the largest
letting in the City of London for three years, taking 235,000 sq ft of
office space at an average rent of Pounds 32.50 per sq ft.
The deal sets a new benchmark for prime City office rents.
Barings has signed a 22-year lease from Scottish Widows, which developed the
site at 60 London Wall, with an 18-month rent-free period but no break
clause, committing Barings to paying the rent until the end of the lease.
It will pay annual rent of Pounds 7.75m, equivalent to Pounds 35 per sq ft
for the best space but less for lower floors.
In a separate transaction, Scottish Widows is taking over the lease on
offices at America Square now occupied by Baring Securities.
Rent due under this lease is Pounds 3m, with a two-year rent free period to
find a tenant.
In spite of the complex nature of the deal, agents said that rents for the
best office space in the City had clearly risen from the Pounds 30 per sq ft
which prevailed earlier in the year.

Yesterday's curriculum announcement may have been the final act of a dispute
which has convulsed education since 1988.
The concept of a national curriculum had broad backing when it was
introduced as part of Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act. Religious and
physical education had previously been the only compulsory subjects, and
education in England and Wales was felt to be wildly out of step with that
of other European Union nations.
However, Mr Baker split with his prime minister, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, over
the form the curriculum should take. She favoured a curriculum that simply
ensured all children had been taught a basic core of subjects. Mr Baker,
whose view prevailed, preferred a more ambitious prescriptive curriculum.
Once the officials at the education department started drawing up the
curriculum a second problem became apparent. The current education
secretary, Mrs Gillian Shephard, referred to it yesterday: 'It is
understandable that when you set up a national curriculum there is likely to
be a tension between looking after teachers' workload, and the desire from
subject specialists to put more and more and more into the curriculum.'
As a result, teachers complained that the original curriculum, compiled by
enthusiastic subject experts, took up all of class time.
Testing proved a second - and critical - problem. The curriculum had been
designed for continuous assessment by teachers, with long descriptions of
pupils' attainments and tasks for children to perform. Its tests were meant
simply to help 'diagnose' individual pupils' problems.
But in 1991 Mr Kenneth Clarke, then education secretary, announced plans to
publish league tables of schools' performances in the tests. He appointed
Lord Griffiths, chairman of the rightwing Institute of Policy Studies
think-tank, to run the quango administering the curriculum. His brief was to
produce simple 'paper and pencil' tests.
The first tests for 14-year-olds were scheduled to be taken in 1993.
However, English teachers reacted angrily to the first draft test papers
published in January. All three of the main teachers' unions boycotted the
tests. They were taken in less than 5 per cent of state schools.
Mr John Patten, who succeeded Mr Clarke, appointed Sir Ron Dearing to review
the curriculum in April 1993, in an attempt to persuade the teachers to
abandon their boycott. It failed.
Sir Ron appeared yesterday to have produced a package which would keep Mrs
Shephard in position rather longer than her predecessors.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FINAL REVISION: WHAT EVERY CHILD SHOULD KNOW
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The national curriculum must be studied in all state schools in England
and Wales, by children aged 5-16. Its compulsory core subjects are
English, mathematics, science and design &amp; technology. Subsidiary
subjects are modern languages (compulsory only from age 11), information
technology and physical education (both compulsory throughout); and
history, geography, art and music (optional from age 14). Children are
expected to have been taught certain subjects and topics by the end of
'key stages' one (at age 7), two (11), three (14) and four (16). At the
end of each key stage, children must be assessed on whether they have
reached defined attainment targets. This is checked by pupils' coverage
of 200 'level descriptions' which describe the level they should have
reached. Assessment in each subject follows a 10-level scale. The aim is
for the most able to reach level 10 by age 16.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage one (age 7):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils must be introduced 'with appropriate sensitivity' to the
  importance of standard English.
Maths: emphasis is on mastering basic arithmetic (addition, division,
  subtraction, multiplication).
Science: pupils should be taught about 'systematic enquiry', and science
  'in everyday life'. Basic biology and physics.
The main changes: Tougher on traditional grammar than before. Proposals
  to correct pupils for speaking non-standard English, even in the
  playground, have been dropped.
  Study of specifically British history compulsory for the first time.
  In science, study of electricity is now compulsory.
  In maths, children must learn to work without calculators.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage two (age 11):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: pupils to learn to plan, draft, revise, proof-read and present
  written material, and read 'a range of modern fiction by significant
  children's authors'.
Maths: applied mathematics, including interpreting basic statistics,
  probability theory, and building 2- and 3-dimensional shapes.
Science: work on materials, building simple electrical circuits,
  basic astronomy.
Technology: pupils to work with 'a range of materials and components',
  and recognise hazards.
The main changes: There is to be more emphasis on mental arithmetic in
  maths and less work on nutrition in science. Work on energy and
  resources deferred until secondary school. The requirement to study
  the history of technology dropped. Pupils are to attempt a recognised
  version of a team game in PE.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
At key stage three (age 14):
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
English: students to have read at least two Shakespeare plays, plus a
  range of classic authors.
Maths: pupils should use graphs, algebra, geometry.
Science: biology, chemistry and physics.
Technology: pupils must learn designing skills and about systems and
  control.
The main changes: Requirement on number of different technology subjects
  to be covered dropped. Pupils can specialise in only one.
  Algebra and number made separate mathematical topics.
  Reading list of prescribed pre-20th century writers but teachers can
  choose their own 20th-century authors.
  Extra emphasis on IT and media studies.
  Extra coverage of chemistry within general science.
  British history to be 'set in European and world perspective'.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Heathrow tunnel probe focuses on design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investigators into the tunnel collapse at Heathrow Airport are concentrating
their inquiries on the possibility that human error or design problems may
have caused the collapse.
BAA, the airport authority, confirmed yesterday that its inquiry had found
nothing so far to suggest that the New Austrian Tunnelling Method being used
to excavate two new underground stations beneath the airport was unsuitable
for use in London clay.
The investigation led by Mr David Williams, BAA's projects director, is
working closely with the Health and Safety Executive which is conducting a
separate inquiry into the collapse.
BAA said that both investigations were 'focusing inquiries on the design,
workmanship and the physical ground conditions in the area'. They will
examine work being done at the base of the main concourse tunnel close to
Terminal Four where an initial ground movement led to the collapse.
Investigators are also likely to look at monitoring equipment and procedures
used to provide early warning of ground movements. In normal circumstances
these would have been expected to allow sufficient time to strengthen the
tunnel and prevent a collapse.
Work has halted on the two Heathrow stations - which will form part of a
Pounds 300m rail link between the airport and Paddington Station in central
London - pending a clear outcome of the inquiries.
The preliminary findings of the BAA investigation may encourage managers of
the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee Underground line extension. Work was halted at two
new stations on the extension - Waterloo and London Bridge - also being
built using the Austrian method.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Teachers finally welcome curriculum: Unions say proposals
vindicate boycott - Labour attacks 'Pounds 750m' spent on the reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's final proposals yesterday for the national curriculum for
England and Wales appeared to have successfully drawn a line under Sir Ron
Dearing's review after the plans were welcomed by teachers' unions.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary, said it would 'continue the drive
to raise standards, while at the same time giving teachers more professional
freedom'.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour education spokesman, also welcomed the results of
Sir Ron's consultation, but attacked the amount spent in the process.
He described it as a 'less prescriptive curriculum in line with what we have
been seeking all along'.
Mr Blunkett said the curriculum had cost the taxpayer Pounds 750m. Mrs
Shephard said this figure included items that would have been bought in any
case - such as textbooks - and described the criticism as a 'diversionary
tactic' by Labour, which had opposed introduction of the original
curriculum. The correct figure was about Pounds 600m, according to the
Department for Education.
Sir Ron's new curriculum answered the most serious criticisms from teachers'
unions but also shifted towards a more traditional emphasis in several areas
including standard English, basic arithmetic, British history and team
sports. These were interpreted by some teachers as concessions to Tory
rightwingers.
The curriculum will be compulsory in all state schools in England and Wales
from September next year and will stay in force for at least five years.
Sir Ron says that as a result of the review 20 per cent of lesson time will
be filled at teachers' discretion up to the age of 14. At this point several
subjects, such as history and geography, will from next year become
voluntary, and the curriculum only prescribes 60 per cent of children's
study for their final two years in compulsory schooling.
Documentation surrounding the curriculum has also been sharpened, with a
total reduction in content from 330 to 222 pages, while the 966 'statements'
of attainment, which teachers were supposed to use to measure pupils'
progress, have been scrapped. In their place are 200 'descriptions' of the
levels children have reached in different subjects. The '10-level scale' to
measure children's progress will now terminate at the age of 14, meaning in
effect that most pupils can only reach level eight.
Sir Ron joined Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, in arguing that there was
no need to keep detailed records of progress of every child in every element
of the curriculum.
In response to employers' concerns, Sir Ron has asked teachers to
concentrate on the basics of numeracy and literacy at primary school. In
secondary schools, children can concentrate on individual crafts as part of
the technology syllabus, and will be offered general vocational alternatives
outside the national curriculum after the age of 14.
Teachers' unions claimed the measures vindicated their boycott of the tests
used to assess the curriculum.
The NUT teachers' union, which is still considering a boycott of this year's
tests, guardedly welcomed the proposals. Mr Doug McAvoy, NUT general
secretary, said: 'After six wasted years and hundreds of millions of pounds,
a more manageable curriculum has been produced.'
But he added that concerns over prescription remained, particularly in
English, while teachers would want 'to see the fine print' before they were
convinced the new curriculum would reduce workload.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, of the NASUWT teachers' union, said: 'The boycott has
served its workload-reducing purpose in respect of the government which is
clearly now listening to teachers.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Roads agency to reduce staff cuts after protests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition from staff has forced the Highways Agency to scale down
restructuring plans. The agency, which was set up in April to take over
responsibility for the Department of Transport's roadbuilding programme, has
reduced the number of proposed job losses from 500 to 450, which will take
its workforce next year to a total of 1,950.
It will also keep open offices in Manchester and Bristol previously destined
for closure and keep more staff in the regions instead of relocating them to
London.
The agency still believes it will be able to achieve cost savings of more
than 20 per cent by the target date of 1995-96, reducing its annual budget
to Pounds 73m.
The IPMS civil service union, the union with the largest number of members
at the agency, said it hoped other government departments would appreciate
the need to involve staff in restructuring plans.
'The agency has recognised reality,' said Mr John Higgins, national officer
for the IPMS. 'They were surprised at the vehemence with which staff greeted
their proposals.'
Construction industry sources said morale was so low at the agency after
cuts had been announced that roadbuilding work slowed considerably. The
agency had originally planned to base its road programme directorate in a
single office in Birmingham, but staff resistance to moving has meant that
the satellite offices will be kept.
Most of the agency's traffic division will now stay in Bristol and not be
moved to London while its land teams will be based at offices in Leeds,
Bradford, Dorking in Surrey, London and Exeter.
IPMS said the revised proposals were an improvement but it is to meet agency
officials next week to press for offices in Newcastle upon Tyne and
Nottingham to be kept open.
Mr Lawrie Haynes, the private-sector manager brought in as chief executive
of the agency, said: 'These modifications reflect the value of effective
consultation. Retaining the expertise of existing staff is as important to
the future of the agency as introducing modern management systems and more
efficient procedures.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Nutritionists offer a la carte menu: How the recommendations
clashed with the industry's taste / Salt consumption 'should be reduced by
third'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trying to help the public to choose foods for a healthier diet seemed to the
doctors and nutritionists who wrote yesterday's report on prevention of
heart disease to be simply a practical extension of years of work.
Little new science is revealed in the report by the Committee on Medical
Aspects of Food Policy (Coma). The once-a-decade review of cardiovascular
disease and ways to prevent it largely reiterated previous findings.
The new step, though, is to identify the sort of trade-offs the public could
make to achieve widely agreed targets on consumption of fat and other food
types. A portion of steamed white fish, for example, would save 33g over a
portion of deep-fried fish.
But when news of the committee's initiative leaked this summer, large
sectors of the food industry mounted a heavy lobbying campaign against it.
To many manufacturers it seemed like an attempt to dictate the nation's
diet. Worse, it seemed like an attempt to single out products unfairly. Why
cut biscuits, for example, when you could achieve the same reduction in fat
consumption by eating less cheese? It also seemed to steer consumers away
from highly processed foods towards fruit, vegetables and other products
closer to the farm gate.
United Biscuits, Cadbury Schweppes and Tate &amp; Lyle were but three companies
who with their trade body,the Food and Drink Federation, vigorously
protested to the government.
'I was completely taken by surprise,' said Professor Michael Marmot, Coma
chairman and head of the department of epidemiology and public health at
University College London's medical school.
'We agree with previous committees on what constitutes healthy eating,' he
added yesterday. 'We are very careful not to say which were 'killer' foods.
But we are offering people a choice. If you eat a dozen biscuits a day you
have to trade off by reducing something else.'
He hopes the Department of Health, through its Nutrition Task Force and
other bodies, will disseminate the report's recommendations to the public.
Through such education he hopes consumers will modify their eating habits.
The department tried to defuse the row yesterday. Dr Kenneth Calman, the
government's chief medical officer, said the government's policy remained
the food consumption targets identified in 'The Health of the Nation,' the
health strategy laid out in a 1992 white paper.
Moreover, the food guidelines issued yesterday were only an attempt to
express the overall change needed in the nation's diet to meet those
targets; and people were free to pick and chose from the list to meet the
consumption targets.
Food manufacturers seemed broadly to accept the approach except the salt
makers.
Mr Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the Food and Drink Federation,
said that as consumers' awareness and tastes change, companies were likely
to adapt their products,
Already some 70 per cent of Wrigley's chewing gum and 40 per cent of Coca
Cola's drinks are sugar-free.
City analysts suggested that given the sort of trade-offs people could make
within the committee's guidelines, it would be hard to assess how
consumption patterns would change.
Tate &amp; Lyle, for example, might lose on sugars but gain on other sweetners
while Associated British Foods could lose on cakes but gain on breads.
However, change is slower in the UK than in some other markets. For example,
Cadbury Schweppes makes a sugar-free, own-label chocolate for J. Sainsbury,
the largest UK supermarket chain. But it offered it only because the
retailer wanted it.
United Biscuits has already responded to US consumers. More than 20 per cent
of its output in the US consists of fat-reduced and fat-free biscuits as
against 5 per cent in the UK.
Nutritionists point out, however, that there is a crucial difference between
companies creating new, premium-priced niche products such as reduced-fat
biscuits, and reducing fat, sugar and salt in their main products.
The latter approach is a more direct attempt to affect what people eat and
nutritionists are planning to keep up the pressure on companies to adopt it.
Heinz is one of the few companies to make reductions across a range of main
products. Over the past eight years it has reduced the sugar content of its
baked beans by 22 per cent and has cut salt.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Food lobby welcomes healthy diet guidelines: Report urges
eating changes to cut heart disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food manufacturers broadly welcomed yesterday a report recommending changes
in diet to help reduce the UK's level of coronary heart disease, which is
among the highest in Europe.
Leaks about the report during the summer prompted heavy lobbying by the Food
and Drink Federation and some of its members such as Cadbury Schweppes, the
confectionery and soft drink maker, Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar refiner, and
United Biscuits.
They believed that the report by the cardiovascular review group of the
Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (Coma) would make detailed
dietary recommendations suggesting, for example, cuts in consumption of
sweets and biscuits.
Yesterday, however, Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical
officer, distanced the government from some of the report's recommendations
such as a reduction in salt consumption. He also stressed that the
committee's recommendations were only broad guidelines from which people
could pick and chose and that the government's own nutrition targets
remained unchanged.
Mr Michael Mackenzie, director-general of the federation, said: 'We are very
pleased that Dr Calman put the Coma report in its proper context. It is up
to individual tastes, and you can't have a prescribed diet. We are
consumer-led companies and you will see companies adapting to changing
demands.'
Coma's most controversial recommendation was a one-third reduction in salt
consumption. The Salt Manufacturers' Association was 'appalled' by the
proposal.
Mr William Cortazzi, association chairman, said, 'scientists are extremely
polarised' over whether a reduction in salt intake reduces blood pressure,
'you can't live without salt and products taste revolting if they don't have
salt'.
Dr Calman said salt reduction was not a target of government policy and 'we
respect the differences' in scientific opinion.
He and other health professionals welcomed, however, the report as a first
effort to turn nutritional information into dietary guidelines the public
could more easily understand.
Dr Mac Armstrong, secretary of the British Medical Association, said: 'What
the public really needs is clear, simple guidelines to cut through all the
claims and counter claims of the food advertising industry and tell them
what they really need to know. The Coma report does exactly that.'
A healthier diet would reduce the incidence of heart disease in Britain,
said Prof Michael Marmot, Coma chairman. It remained higher than all
European countries except Finland, the Republic of Ireland and the countries
of central and eastern Europe.

FT  11 NOV 94 / British Coal wins ruling on patent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal stands to save several million pounds after the Court of Appeal
ruled in its favour in a patent case involving its Coal Products subsidiary.
The case could also have implications for the corporation's forthcoming sale
of the subsidiary, which manufactures smokeless fuels.
In the Court of Appeal ruling, judges unanimously overturned a decision of
Mr Justice Mummery who found Coal Products had infringed the Belgian company
Glaverbel's patented process for repairing the lining of refractory ovens.
Coal Products said it based its process on technology which it has always
asserted is in the public domain.
Mr Andrew Inglis, partner at Nabarro Nathanson, solicitors acting for
British Coal, said he expected the Court of Appeal to order Glaverbel to pay
British Coal's costs.
British Coal has selected four companies as preferred bidders for Coal
Products including Anglo United, the quoted company which makes the Coalite
smokeless fuel.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Aerospace groups launch competitiveness campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Society of British Aerospace Companies yesterday launched a campaign to
improve competitiveness. The initiative flows from the Department of Trade
and Industry's white paper on competition, and is similar to that already
launched in the motor industry.
Mr Tim Eggar, industry minister, opened the scheme at a seminar in London.
The campaign is supported by large companies such as British Aerospace, GEC
and Rolls-Royce.
The society's Competitiveness Challenge encourages aerospace manufacturers
to share information about best industry practice and to co-operate to
deepen understanding between component suppliers and the big assembling
companies. It will use seminars, workshops and self-assessment
questionnaires to help companies understand where their advantages and
problems lie.
As well as the 200 members of the society, the information will be open to
800 other companies in allied fields which are being encouraged to join the
campaign. The scheme is intended to be self-financing, with companies being
charged for access to the information. The DTI has earmarked an annual grant
of Pounds 55,000 a year.
The aerospace industry has improved its balance of trade surplus in the past
decade, a distinction shared only by the chemical and pharmaceutical
industries.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Open-ended funds framework set out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday set out part of the regulatory framework it intends
to put in place for open-ended investment companies when they are allowed in
the UK next year.
OEICs are a different form of pooled investment funds from unit trusts. They
are common in other European countries and in north America, where investors
are unfamiliar with unit trusts, and their introduction into the UK is
intended to help British fund managers compete more effectively.
Among the significant elements to the regime will be that OEICs will be able
to include 'umbrella funds' and that 'bearer shares' will also be allowed.
Both are allowed, but rarely used, in unit trusts.
Umbrella funds - through which an OEIC is made up of a number of sub-funds -
give fund managers the marketing opportunity of offering investors the
ability to switch from one fund to another more cheaply than otherwise.

Water companies expect virtually no overall growth in water demand over the

The forecasts suggest that a strong increase in demand by households will be

FT  11 NOV 94 / Wholesale fruit and veg markets 'under threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in retail buying patterns are threatening the survival of wholesale
fruit and vegetable markets, says a report released yesterday by Strathclyde
University.
The study was commissioned by the Fresh Produce Consortium. It says the
markets, which sold Pounds 2.3bn of fresh produce last year, will decline
quickly unless there are early reforms.
It predicts that the market share of wholesale fruit and vegetable sellers
will fall by 25 per cent over the next decade as more supermarkets buy
directly from growers. That translates into a sales loss for the wholesale
sector of Pounds 500m.
Britain's 37 wholesale markets such as New Covent Garden in London and
independent wholesalers sell 47 per cent of the nation's fruit and
vegetables. But Professor Susan Shaw, one of the study's authors, said they
could disappear unless they took more notice of their customers' needs and
invested in new technology.
The decline of the wholesale sector would mean a loss of variety and breadth
of choice for consumers, Prof Shaw said.
Farmers would be unable to choose an outlet for their produce and would be
in the hands of the powerful supermarket buyers.
She said wholesale markets needed to collaborate to survive as well as
sharpen up their business skills and refurbish their premises. She added:
'Many markets are dingy and depressing places in which to do business.'
Prof Shaw said wholesalers needed to band together to improve quality and
credit controls as well as invest in new technology such as better cooling
facilities.
She stressed that wholesale markets had a number of advantages because they
provided a wide choice of produce in a flexible and convenient way. However,
many of their customers were small, independent retailers threatened by the
growth of supermarkets and out-of-town shopping.
Mr Michael Jack, a junior agriculture minister, said the debate on the
future of the markets had to be wide and concluded quickly so that action
could be taken.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Farmers say proposals could be boost for horticulture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Horticulture could receive a big boost from the change in eating patterns
encouraged by the Coma report if they are adopted widely by the public, the
National Farmers' Union said yesterday.
Fruit and vegetables account for annual sales of roughly Pounds 6bn with 82
per cent of vegetables and 15 per cent of fruit provided by home growers.
Large growers are already expanding to cope with increased demand and are
moving into further processing of fruit and vegetables to meet the needs of
supermarkets. For example, lettuce growers often package their own salads by
washing them and presenting leaves in a plastic bag as a way of meeting
consumer demands for convenience foods.
One NFU official said: 'If people do respond to this report, there is
clearly a big opportunity for certain sectors of agriculture and for others
more of a challenge.'
Demand for leaner meat is likely to prove more difficult for farmers. The
livestock industry has reduced the fat content of most meat considerably
over the past 20 years in response to the demands of healthier eating. The
pig and poultry sectors have had most success at reducing fat levels in meat
with the fat content in pork falling 35 per cent since 1975 to 3.5 per cent.
Farmers have reduced the fat content in beef by 15 per cent and lamb by 11
per cent to an average of 5.5 per cent. Some cuts of meat such as pork leg
now contain as little as 1.7 per cent fat.
The reduction in fat has been achieved by using low fat feeding programmes
and continental breeds of cattle rather than the indigenous Herefords and
Anguses, which are more fatty.
However Mr Martin Burtt, a livestock farmer from Yorkshire, said: 'You
cannot breed out fat entirely, meat has to have fat to give it flavour and
hold it together. We're close to optimum levels of fat now.'
Sir David Naish, NFU president, said: 'We have been encouraging farmers to
respond to signals from the marketplace and I believe this report, which
offers sensible guidelines on healthy eating, will help us to do that.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / More builders cutting house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of builders trying to boost house sales with offers of price cuts
and free cars and holidays has risen sharply in recent weeks, a leading
house builder said yesterday.
The report by Mr Steve Morgan, chairman of Redrow, coincided with a survey
of 4,000 estate agents which showed a fall in all types of house sales last
month
The survey by Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents (OCEA) covering 26
estate agency chains and accounting for about half of UK house transactions,
showed a 7.5 per cent fall in net sales compared with October last year.
Sales were also 5.3 per cent lower than during September this year, said Mr
Peter Constable, chairman of OCEA.
The organisation did not blame the decrease on the half percentage point
rise in general interest rates announced in September.
It said: 'Housing activity declines towards the year end but sales volumes
have fallen rather earlier this year. This is due in part to potential
purchasers being distracted by high street retailers starting their
Christmas promotions earlier.
'Housing activity also tends to be dampened due to change to an Autumn
budget and house buying will decline further as we approach the peak festive
season.'
Mr Morgan, speaking to shareholders at Redrow's annual meeting, said: 'There
has been an unwelcome return in the new homes market to discounting in
recent times.'
Those builders with a December year end are thought to have stepped up
offers of discounts and incentives during the final few weeks of the year to
meet sales targets.
Mr Paul Pedley, Redrow's managing director said: 'You only have to look at
newspaper advertisements to see that more companies are offering incentives
to shift sales.'
Redrow, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange this year and is
expected to build more than 2,000 homes in 1994, said it did not expect the
trend to continue into 1995.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Sutherland warns of US 'mortal blow' -
Failure to ratify Uruguay Round could put trading system in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Failure by the US to ratify the Uruguay Round global trade accords this year
would deal a 'mortal blow' to the international trading system, Mr Peter
Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, said yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of a Gatt study which shows an annual Dollars 510bn
potential income boost to the world economy from the Uruguay Round, Mr
Sutherland said postponement of the US decision was not an option. World
leaders had committed themselves to bringing the round, and the World Trade
Organisation, Gatt's successor, into force next January. Failure to do so
could destroy the results of eight years of negotiations.
'It would be inconceivable that a country that has so much to gain from the
Uruguay Round could strike a mortal blow to the system by putting off the
debate,' he said. The Gatt report says trade liberalisation in goods alone
could add over Dollars 120bn a year to US national income by 2005, more than
a fifth of the total.
US 'fast-track' authority, under which Congress votes on the Uruguay Round
implementing legislation without amendment, is due to expire at the end of
this year. Without this authority legislators could pick the accord to
pieces, effectively killing it.
The Gatt chief said it was very difficult to see the WTO coming into
existence without the US, which was most countries' biggest trading partner.
The consequences of a failure to ratify on time by any of the leading
traders would be 'extremely serious and very, very dangerous for the world
economy'.
Not only would the world lose the benefits of the Uruguay Round. The effect
would be ultimately to destroy the trading system built up so painstakingly
since the last war. 'The whole multilateral system would be extremely
seriously - mortally, I would say - damaged,' he said.
The world income gain from Uruguay Round liberalisation of trade in goods
shown in the latest Gatt report is twice the annual Dollars 235bn estimated
earlier this year. Gatt's new economic model tries to capture the effects of
increased competition in domestic markets, scale economies from expanded
world markets and the 'dynamic' impact of higher income on savings and
investment.
Of the extra global income of Dollars 510bn a year under Gatt's 'most
plausible' set of estimates, nearly two-thirds results from reductions in
non-tariff barriers. Of these, the most important is the phase-out of the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement governing trade in textiles and clothing, which
could greatly reduce prices for consumers in the US and Europe and treble
world exports.
Cuts in industrial tariffs contribute about a quarter of the gains, partly
through price cuts in domestic markets and partly through increased exports.
Reductions in farm trade barriers account for about 10 per cent.
On a country basis, the US is the biggest single beneficiary, reaping an
income gain of Dollars 122bn a year by 2005, while the European Union
benefits by over Dollars 163bn a year. In both cases, the bulk of the gains
come from lowering non-tariff barriers, especially scrapping MFA
restrictions and, in the EU's case, ending curbs on car imports from Japan.
Japan will have an income boost of Dollars 27bn a year, the smaller figure
in part reflecting its already low industrial tariffs and absence of MFA
restrictions. Developing and transition economics, excluding China and
Taiwan, gain Dollars 116bn a year. China could benefit to the tune of nearly
Dollars 20bn a year and Taiwan by over Dollars 10bn.
The report stresses that even its new estimates are likely to understate
substantially the benefits of the Uruguay Round because they do not take
account of liberalisation in trade in services, and the impact of
strengthened trade rules and dispute settlement procedures.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Apec officials agree on code for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officials of the 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum agreed late last night on the text of a new code on
foreign direct investment in a move that removed, for the time being, a
serious block to progress on trade liberalisation at their meeting here.
'We have reached a constructive conclusion,' said Mr Peter Adams of New
Zealand, co-chairman of the group which has been struggling to resolve
differences over investment all week. Neither he nor other delegates would
comment on details of the agreement, but US officials, who had objected to
an earlier draft on the grounds that it was too weak, said they were pleased
with the outcome.
The text must be approved by Apec ministers who start formal talks here
today in the run-up to next week's summit. Several officials warned that the
agreement could not be regarded as final since ministers might want to
change the text. But they said they had managed to reach agreement on a
unified text which should prevent the politicians becoming bogged down in
their own contentious drafting process.
A row over the investment code has been simmering here all week as
Washington sought stronger wording on several clauses. Although the code is
non-binding, the US was worried that the original draft offered
international investors insufficient protection against regulatory
discrimination by the host government. The US felt the code also lacked
teeth in combating restrictions on repatriation of profits and the
imposition of arbitrary export performance standards.
Part of the problem was that the original draft was weaker in this regard
than a similar agreement reached in the Uruguay Round. Right up till last
night, however, differences within Apec had threatened to create an impasse
even before the summit began.
Agreement at the official level will improve the mood of today's opening
ministerial meeting, but there is no guarantee that this technical advance
will make it easier to resolve deep-seated differences over the timetable
for full liberalisation of trade in the Asia-Pacific region.
Officials said they had not begun to consider the target date of 2020
proposed by Apec's independent group of eminent persons. This is being left
for heads of state at their meeting here next week, but Mr Fred Bergsten,
the US economist who chaired the eminent persons group, said last night he
was optimistic that a decision could be reached.
Mr Bergsten said that the Republican victory in this week's congressional
elections might make the conduct of US trade policy easier. The Republicans
will want to show they can work with the Clinton administration, he said,
and they have fewer disagreements on trade and foreign policy than on
domestic issues.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Gatt panel to rule on Indian car complaint

A Gatt disputes panel is to rule on a disagreement over imports of Indian
cars into Poland, an issue which could have important implications for the
European Union's trade agreements with former communist states in eastern
Europe.
India says a doubling of Poland's tariff on cars in 1992, coupled with a
duty-free quota for the EU under a 1991 bilateral agreement, have hurt its
car exports to Poland and thus violated its Gatt rights. According to the
Indian complaint, its car deliveries to Poland fell from 4,568 units in
1991-92 to 1,000 in 1992-93 and to 504 in 1993-94. No deliveries have been
made this year.
India, whose request for a Gatt panel was granted by Gatt's governing
council yesterday, said the Polish measures could not be justified under
Gatt rules on free trade areas and breached Gatt's non-discrimination
principle.
Strong support for India came from Japan, which said its own car exports to
Poland had been affected, and from a number of other countries including the
US, South Korea and several south-east Asian and Latin American nations. The
EU and 11 other countries said they intended to make representations to the
panel.
Among other items discussed yesterday:
The council decided to postpone discussion of a disputes panel report ruling
mainly in Washington's favour on US car taxes designed to penalise excessive
fuel consumption. The EU had charged that these discriminated against
European exports of luxury cars.
The EU and 46 developing countries requested a formal waiver from Gatt rules
for the Lome Convention which gives EU trade preferences to 70 Third World
nations. However, the US and some other countries asked for more time to
consider the details of the waiver and the council postponed discussion to
the annual meeting of Gatt members next month. EU officials said afterwards
they were confident that the waiver, which needs a two-thirds majority vote,
would pass.
A report on dispute settlement activity showed a substantial drop in
disputes brought to Gatt over the past 12 months, a decrease attributed
partly to the expected entry into force next January of tougher dispute
settlement rules under the new World Trade Organisation.
Georgia became the last former Soviet republic to become a Gatt observer,
along with Sudan which has applied directly for WTO membership.

FT  11 NOV 94 / World Trade News: British mission heads for India

<TEXT>
A specially chartered Concorde will leave the UK for India on Sunday
carrying Mr Richard Needham, Britain's trade minister, and 85 top
industrialists, small businessmen and bankers on the UK's biggest ever trade
mission.
The week-long tour of Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay and Madras is the most
ambitious step yet by the Department of Trade and Industry to boost British
trade with India, which last year was worth more than Pounds 1bn in each
direction.
Mr Needham, who is leading the mission, said in London yesterday that
opportunities for UK companies in India were unrivalled by any other market
in the world: along with China, India is one of the world's two fastest
growing developing economies.
The mission marks a further British attempt to build on historic links and
benefit from India's economic liberalisation programme. 'India is opening up
to investment, joint ventures and increasingly to overseas trade,' Mr
Needham said. Last year, bilateral trade was marginally positive in
Britain's favour, but this year UK exports have been rising at a slower rate
than its imports from India, suggesting there will be a small deficit for
the year as a whole.
Mr Needham said the UK was already playing a big role in India, but he hoped
the mission would lead to more deals, especially in infrastructure projects
such as telecommunications and power.
The presence of bankers and insurance executives on the trip reflected the
importance for India of private-sector 'build-own-operate' and
'build-operate-transfer' infrastructure projects, whose financing
arrangements are normally complex.
Mr Needham is particularly keen to encourage partnerships between UK and
Indian companies, such as a 50:50 joint venture announced yesterday by
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, and RPG
Enterprises, India's fourth largest business group.
The two companies have formed RPG-RR Power Engineering to modernise and
refurbish India's older power plants. The signing ceremony will be in
Calcutta on Monday.
Mr Sanjiv Goenka, vice chairman of RPG Enterprises, said that 'the power
shortage in India can be mitigated to some extent by improving the
operational efficiency of the old power plants. The majority of power plants
here are more than 12 years old and many of them need to be renovated.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan have agreed to resume negotiations on opening up Japan's
car market and decided to make another try at striking a long-awaited glass
deal, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, secured the commitment to new
negotiations after a two-hour meeting with Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, his
Japanese counterpart. 'Our meeting was very positive,' said Mr Kantor. 'We
have agreed to re-engage on the full range of auto and auto parts issues.'
Mr Hashimoto, and Mr Kantor are in Jakarta for broader Asia-Pacific talks.
'It's always helpful to meet. We will move forward as rapidly as we can,'
said Mr Kantor, noting there were 'separate potential solutions' to each
part of the sprawling car sector.
Altogether, cars and car parts make up 60 per cent of the lopsided two-way
trade flow, despite repeated efforts to strike a deal and cut the Dollars
60bn imbalance. Mr Kantor said no time had been set for the car talks but
lower level officials would meet on December 5-6, to try to iron out
differences over Japan's Dollars 4.5bn flat glass market.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Clinton blames defeat on message of hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday attributed the Republicans' crushing
victory in this week's mid-term elections to the party's success in
fostering hostility towards government. Their message is no longer as it was
in the 1980s that government is the problem, 'now government is the enemy',
he said.
Speaking at Georgetown University, his alma mater and the site of many of
his most defining campaign speeches, the president seemed more philosophical
than bitter about the huge Democratic losses on Tuesday.
He ticked off his administration's domestic and foreign policy achievements,
concluding that 'in an ordinary time, that record would have generated
support for the congressmen and women who made it'.
But these are not ordinary times, he said. Voters are made insecure by the
'relentless and dynamic' pressures of the global economy. 'On Tuesday, the
voters reflected their frustration with the pace of change and the messy and
often, to them, almost revolting process by which it was made,' he said. The
president again took some of the responsibility 'for policies and political
decisions that hurt our candidates'. Term limits - a key point in the
Republican's mid-term platform - are 'looking better every day', he joked.
On trade, Mr Clinton said that the US has 'never been in a stronger economic
position' to meet the challenges of foreign competition. However, 'for many
people, trade still appears to be a gale-force wind, another threat ready to
blow away the prospects of a stable job at a good wage.'
Mr Clinton expressed confidence that the Uruguay Round implementing
legislation would be approved by Congress later this month. He likened it to
the League of Nations which the US Congress failed to approve after the
first world war. 'When the US failed to engage we paid a terrible price and
so did the rest of the world in economic stagnation, isolation and
eventually another world war,' he said.
Next week, at the meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation group
he hoped 'to move from a common vision to a common direction . . . to set
concrete goals to open the way for doing business in Asia'. He expected the
leaders to set a 'target date' for achieving free trade in the region.
He would take up human rights questions during the visit but did not expect
any 'sudden' breakthrough.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Candidates count on the absentee vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of a handful of elections, including for the Senate in
California and the governorship in Maryland, still hung in the balance
yesterday, awaiting recounts and the tallying of absentee ballots.
The California numbers still heavily favour the return of Senator Dianne
Feinstein, the Democrat, over Congressman Michael Huffington. But neither
had officially claimed victory or conceded defeat.
There are an estimated 400,000 absentee votes to be counted in California.
With all state precincts reported, Ms Feinstein had 3,608,497 votes to Mr
Huffington's 3,484,887. The Republican would have to take about two-thirds
of those still outstanding to overcome his deficit; unlikely given the
closeness of the race.
But it was much tighter in Maryland, with about 40,000 absentee ballots. Mr
Parris Glendening, Democrat, led Mrs Ellen Sauerbrey by just over 6,000
votes (683,995 - 677,808). State officials said most still to be counted
came from counties where he had run strongest, but neither side was taking
anything for granted.
The tightest race of all, in which a recount was ordered yesterday, involved
Congressman Sam Gejdenson, the Democrat from Connecticut known for
investigations into US sales to Iraq before the 1991 Gulf war. The official
tally had him winning by just two votes over Mr Edward Munster.
It was still technically possible for Mr Tom Foley, the outgoing Speaker, to
hold on to his Washington seat. But his qualified concession on Wednesday to
Mr George Nethercutt recognised that a 2,274 vote shortfall was unlikely to
be reversed by absentee ballots of at most double that number.
With six House seats nationwide still undecided, the line-up stands at 228
Republicans, 200 Democrats and one independent, compared to the pre-election
256 Democrats, 178 Republicans and the same non-party representative, Mr
Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who squeaked back by just over 7,000 votes out of
200,000 cast.
Probably the most remarkable demographic discovery of the exit polls was the
widening of the gender gap. Nationally, about 54 per cent of men voted
Republican, with the same percentage of women preferring Democrats, the
biggest difference in polling history.
In some key races the split was even wider and occasionally decisive, with
white male voters, many influenced by the conservative Christian Coalition
and the pro-gun lobby, turning out in force. Though they may yet lose, Mr
Huffington got 59 per cent of white male support and Mrs Sauerbrey 58 per
cent, while no less than two out of three supported Mr George W Bush Jr,
conqueror of Governor Ann Richards in Texas.
In Virginia, where the religious right is particularly strong, Mr Oliver
North outpolled Senator Chuck Robb by 46-43 per cent among men, but not
enough to overcome his 48-41 deficit among women.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Budget policy swings in political wind: Republicans'
election success leaves future direction in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republican takeover of Congress has left fiscal experts and financial
market analysts in doubt over the future of the US budget policy.
Is Washington about to embark on a frenzy of tax cuts that could widen the
deficit dramatically unless offset by the kind of severe spending cuts that
neither Republicans nor Democrats have ever shown any real inclination to
undertake?
Will the fiscal restraint begun by President Bill Clinton's 1993 budget
continue as Republicans follow through on their promise to amend the US
constitution to require a balanced federal budget, and take the steps
necessary to achieve that balance?
Or will gridlock set in, leaving the US with its current, relatively
moderate budget deficit but with severe fiscal imbalances in the longer term
unaddressed?
At its most extreme, the new Republican majority in Congress includes
members such as Congressman Dick Armey, a confirmed supply-side economics
professor from north Texas who wants a flat income tax rate, and believes
that tax cuts will pay for themselves because of the additional revenue they
produce.
But Mr Clinton warned in his press conference the day after the Republicans'
crushing election victory that he would 'do all in my power to keep anyone
from jeopardising this economic recovery by taking us back to the policies
that failed before' and produced the rising deficits of the 1980s.
The House Republicans' 'Contract with America' promises measures that would
reduce government revenue, such as a Dollars 500 per child tax credit, lower
tax rates on capital gains and a higher earnings threshold before older
Americans still working lose their social security pension benefits.
But, although it promises a balanced budget constitutional amendment, it
offers no specifics of the spending cuts that would be needed to balance the
budget. Republican candidates have individually been assuring their
constituents that they would not touch social security, Medicare,
agricultural subsidies or veterans' benefits, which together account for 66
per cent of federal spending.
Mr Clinton may have critical support from some Republicans whose priority is
fiscal discipline rather than supply side stimulus.
Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who will take over as chairman of the
Senate budget committee, is a noted fiscal hawk who has stood out from his
party colleagues by his willingness to contemplate higher taxes as a means
of bringing the budget deficit under control. He will not have much support
for that position, but is likely to serve as an important brake on his
colleagues' tax-cutting zeal.
Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, who will have direct control over tax
policy as the new chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, stands
between the two positions - though closer to his fellow Texan than to Mr
Domenici. He concurs with the supply side analysis of a cut in capital gains
tax rates - and also wants to index capital gains to inflation - but insists
on keeping the current Budget Act rules which require any measure involving
a loss in tax revenue to be offset by spending cuts or other tax increases.
'It's a discipline we must apply to the members of the Congress,' he said
yesterday.
'Revenue scoring' - determining whether a measure will increase or reduce
the government deficit - is an esoteric science conducted principally by the
Joint Committee on Taxation, a Senate-House organisation which will be taken
over by Mr Archer and Senator Bob Packwood, the new chairman of the Senate
finance committee, and may therefore be expected to change some of its
methodology.
Past studies have suggested that while a lower capital gains tax increases
revenue in the short term and reduces it over the medium term, its long run
effect is close to neutral.
But an administration analysis of the Republicans' promise to index capital
gains and exclude 50 per cent of gains from tax showed the measure to lose
Dollars 30bn over four years.
Scoring could thus become a crucial battleground between the White House and
the Congress, with accusations of 'smoke and mirrors' flying freely.
In the new political environment, the commission on entitlements chaired by
Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and retiring Republican Senator
John Danforth of Missouri could play an unexpectedly important role.
It was once viewed as a sop from the White House to Mr Kerrey in exchange
for his vote on the 1993 budget, but its findings could now attract much
wider support.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Haitians fear weakening of US support: More conservative
views in Washington will irritate Aristide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Haitian officials fear the Republican party's sweeping success in this
week's mid-term elections threatens continued US support for their country.
Officials in the new administration of Mr Smarck Michel, the prime minister,
are worried that Republican law-makers, many of whom have opposed President
Bill Clinton's policy of military and economic support for Haiti, will
demand a rapid reduction in American involvement.
With Republican control of the US House of Representatives and the Senate
from January, the officials said yesterday, it was likely that a timetable
would be approved for an early withdrawal of US troops from the Caribbean
state, creating a security vacuum before the planned 10,000-member Haitian
police force was recruited and trained.
This could create instability in the country, where law and order is being
maintained by foreign troops and police monitors, they say.
The economic reforms planned by the government may also be threatened by a
harder line from the Republican controlled legislature. The US is the main
donor to a Dollars 800m aid package which international financial
institutions and the Haitian government agree is needed to start rebuilding
the economy and the social and physical infrastructure over the next 15
months.
A more conservative attitude to Haiti by US lawmakers in the New Year is
likely to irritate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is banking on US
support for the remaining 14 months of his administration, diplomats in
Port-au-Prince suggested yesterday.
Without a clear commitment on continuing support from Washington, Mr
Aristide may be inclined to reconsider the political merits of some of the
administrative and economic reforms to which he is now committed,
particularly those likely to be unpopular.
However, a more optimistic position is being taken by US officials in Haiti.
'I think the support for President Aristide and the restoration of democracy
in Haiti will continue to be US policy,' said Mr Stanley Schrager, a
spokesman for the US embassy in Port-au-Prince. 'Thus far it has been
successful and we would hope that success would continue in the future and
that all Americans will continue to support it.'
This is apparently no comfort to the new Haitian administration. Officials
say President Clinton had to ride roughshod over the more liberal outgoing
Democrat-controlled legislature to secure US military pressure to force
Haiti's army leaders out of the country and assure Mr Aristide's
reinstatement.
'The one factor which Mr Clinton has going for his Haiti policy is that it
has been a foreign policy success so far,' said a diplomat to Port-au-Prince
yesterday. 'But now he will be swimming upstream on this issue. This
apparent success might be undone before it is guaranteed - which must be
with the installation of Mr Aristide's successor in February 1996.'
A key player in Washington's Haiti policy in the new legislature will be Mr
Jesse Helms, the Republic senator from North Carolina, who is likely to
become chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Senator Helms has
been a consistent and harsh critic of Mr Aristide, and has publicly
questioned the president's mental stability.
Meanwhile, the new government's priority is to jump-start Haiti's economy,
Mr Michel said. The adjustment of the economy will be done on the basis of
'democracy, justice and tolerance,' with the public sector being rebuilt,
and social services rehabilitated. One immediate government concern is
public health. Maternal and infant mortality are increasing, and there is a
high incidence of tuberculosis.
The new government will try to stimulate economic growth by an early reform
of import tariffs in order to eliminate monopolies. State enterprises and
services which are to be privatised will be sold to companies and
individuals who will be capable of running them efficiently, the prime
minister said.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Cuba and the IMF compare notes: Pascal Fletcher explores the
significance of visits from a much pilloried institution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba has long pilloried the International Monetary Fund as the torch-bearer
of neo-liberal capitalism. It regularly blamed IMF 'shock remedies' for
causing hunger, unemployment and poverty across the Third World, especially
Latin America.
The fact that a senior IMF official should have visited Cuba twice over the
last year is, then, intriguing.
The 'non-official' visits by IMF executive director Mr Jacques de Groote
late last year and early this year do not mean that Cuba, which left the
Fund in the early 1960s, is trying to re-join, at least not yet.
For one thing, the US maintains a blocking objection to Cuban membership as
part of its economic sanctions against Cuba's one-party socialist
government.
But the IMF contacts do reflect an important shift in Cuba's economic policy
since the country was left like an orphan in the world economy after the
disappearance of its protector, the former Soviet Union.
Not only is Cuba trying to beat its recession by implementing reforms the
IMF would not disown, but it is also signalling clearly, perhaps as much
through necessity as conviction, that it wants to come out of the cold and
back into the mainstream of the world economic community.
'Whether we like it or not, (the IMF) is a leading institution in the world
economy and so it is a must for us to know about it,' Mr Raul Amado Blanco,
vice-president of the National Bank of Cuba, the cental bank, said in an
interview.
He said the IMF officials who visited were briefed about Cuba's reform
moves. Cuba learned how the IMF and World Bank had helped other command
economies in eastern Europe and Asia move towards market-oriented policies.
But senior Cuban officials are careful to put limits on the rapprochement
with the IMF and on just how far Cuba intends to go in its reforms.
Mr Amado Blanco said re-joining the Bretton Woods institutions was not being
actively considered. 'We would have to be convinced of the usefulness (of
rejoining). . . whether it would really signify a contribution to our
political and economic policies,' he said.
Cuba's vice-president, Mr Carlos Lage, said Cuba was ready to discuss
economic options with the IMF, the World Bank and anybody else. 'That
doesn't mean we are ready to do what these institutions dictate.'
Nevertheless, the economic reforms being introduced by Cuba would not be out
of place in an IMF or World Bank policy manual. They include cuts in
subsidies to loss-making state companies, selective price increases, farm
reforms, currency reform, decentralisation of decision-making, the
imposition of taxes, moves to control liquidity and an assault on the
yawning budget deficit.
Many of the changes, such as the recent authorisation of public markets for
farm produce and consumer goods, also reflect recommendations made by a team
of Spanish experts led by Spain's former finance minister Mr Carlos
Solchaga.
'Cuba is making a serious structural adjustment effort,' Juan Triana, deputy
director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on the World Economy,
said.
The budget deficit, which in 1993 stood at 4.2bn pesos, has already been
reduced by some 25 per cent this year. The glut of Cuban pesos sluicing
around the economy, estimated at nearly 12bn pesos in circulation at the end
of April, has already been cut by 1.3bn pesos, according to the central
bank.
The moves, also aimed at throttling the black market, have caused a
tightening of the level of pesos in circulation and a fall in the black
market value of one dollar to less than 50 pesos from past lows of more than
100. Putting buying power back into the peso is one of the objectives.
Cuban officials insist the on-going reforms differ from IMF remedies. They
say the state is keeping a dominant, controlling economic role and social
concerns are paramount.
'We have a strategy. . . it's not a strategy of capitalist development. . .
it's a strategy of a planned, socialist economy,' said Mr Lage, who is
viewed as the main architect of Cuba's economic reforms.
He said Cuba would preserve 'the essentials' of its socialist system -
official shorthand for free, universal health, education and other social
services.
At the same time, however, Mr Lage announced Cuba was opening up more of its
economy to foreign investment, namely real estate and sugar production to
foreign investment.
Many foreign economists, however, say Cuba needs to go further, faster. The
IMF's Mr de Groote noted after his November 1993 visit the Cuban authorities
were 'still hesitating over the basic issue of allowing more private
property and individual decision-making in the economy'.
The Spanish team led by Mr Solchaga, in a report in June this year, said
Cuba 'must start to help itself' by moving faster to dismantle rigid
economic structures and opening up more private business opportunities to
Cubans.
Mr Lage hinted the government was working on currency reform, expected to be
the introduction of a convertible peso, and was also considering widening
the legalisation on private, self-employment for Cubans.
Concerns over social unrest, like the unprecedented street disturbances in
Havana on August 5, are undoubtedly giving impetus to the reforms. So too is
the prospect of another record low sugar harvest, the third in a row for
Cuba's sugar-based economy.
Cuba also desperately needs fresh external credits, which have all but dried

FT  11 NOV 94 / Christie's in Dollars 37.5m NY sale: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Christie's auction of Impressionist and Modern art in New York on Wednesday
night was a success, totalling Dollars 37.5m (Pounds 23.4m). A total 44 of
the 57 lots on offer found buyers, and 11 sold for more than Dollars 1m.
This is firm evidence that the art market is recovering its nerve. The
Republican mid-term electoral victories helped to make the American rich
feel that bit richer.
The star lot was a decorative oil by Toulouse-Lautrec of a ballet dancer
adjusting her tights. It sold for Dollars 4.78m (Pounds 3m), well over
double its estimate. In contrast, the most highly rated item, the last
circular version by Monet of his favourite subject, Nympheas (Waterlilies),
still in private hands, sold for just Dollars 3.3m, well below its Dollars
4m-Dollars 6m estimate.
Nympheas had decorated the Manhattan apartment of the late Alice Tully and
Christie's had guaranteed her executors a fixed sum, reputedly around
Dollars 25m, for the chance to sell her collection. Fortunately for
Christie's all five Tully pictures in this auction found buyers.
Another painting which carried a guarantee, one of six of the same model
painted by Corot when confined to his studio with gout, also sold below
target, for Dollars 1.43m as against the Dollars 1.8m-Dollars 2.2m estimate.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Producer index fall blunts inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Low prices for new cars helped US producer prices to fall last month by 0.5
per cent, blunting fears of rising inflation.
The Labour Department said the drop in the producer price index in the month
of October, following another 0.5 per cent fall in September, left the
change in prices over the past 12 months at just 1.0 per cent.
Part of the decline in October was attributed to the fact that prices for
new model year cars rose less than anticipated by the Labour Department's
seasonal adjustments. But even without the drop in car prices, the index
still fell by 0.1 per cent in October.
The department's index of core wholesale inflation, excluding the often
volatile food and energy prices, also fell by 0.5 per cent, leaving a
year-on-year increase of 1.8 per cent.
Some economists pointed out that prices for intermediate goods rose by 0.3
per cent in October and by 3.0 per cent over the last 12 months, while crude
goods, excluding energy and food, rose in price by 0.9 per cent last month
and by 13.1 per cent over the year.
Nevertheless, a majority of economists viewed the producer price data as
good news for US inflation.
Statistics published earlier this week showed that unit labour costs in the
US have risen by only 0.9 per cent over the past year and that manufacturing
unit labour costs have fallen by 3.8 per cent during the same period, and
this lack of wage increases was expected to limit the upward pressure on
prices caused by rising US commodity prices.
While financial markets remain firmly convinced that the Federal Reserve
must raise interest rates at the meeting of its Federal Open Markets
Committee next week, the evidence that wholesale inflation remains subdued
may take the edge off mounting expectations in the markets that the Fed
might add as much as a full percentage point to interest rates.
The Fed has preferred to adjust its monetary policy in smaller increments,
because of the difficulty of readjusting policy if its forecasts should
prove to be wrong.
But bond market dealers have become increasingly fretful that the Fed is
'behind the curve' in its actions to control any future inflationary threat,
and even a half percentage point increase - the most probable outcome of
next Tuesday's FOMC meeting - could prove disappointing to the markets.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Matsushita to head Japan's central bank: Sakura Bank adviser
nominated after long wrangle inside government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government last night nominated as the next governor of the
Bank of Japan Mr Yasuo Matsushita, a former career bureaucrat who is now an
adviser to Sakura Bank, one of the country's largest commercial banks.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, told a midnight press conference
that Mr Matsushita would replace Mr Yasushi Mieno when the five-year term of
the current central bank chief expires next month.
The appointment comes at the end of an unusually long wrangle within the
government over the choice of governor. Mr Matsushita, himself a vice
finance minister in the mid-1980s, was thought to have been the favoured
choice of finance ministry officials.
But Mr Takemura, in a display of independence, had expressed doubts about
the appointment and insisted on considering other candidates. His
announcement, which is subject to formal cabinet ratification, means the
ministry's views have prevailed.
Mr Takemura was quoted as saying that Mr Mieno 'strongly recommended' Mr
Matsushita, who was chosen because of his international experience and
outstanding career in finance.
Mr Matsushita joined the ministry of finance in 1950 after graduating in law
from Tokyo University. He rose through the ranks and ascended to the top
job, vice minister for finance, in 1982, but subsequently left the
government for the private sector.
He is not expected to depart significantly from the policies of Mr Mieno,
who has presided over one of the most turbulent periods in Japanese
financial history. On taking office in 1989 the governor raised interest
rates in order to burst the speculative bubble of asset price inflation of
the late 1980s.
When that policy led to the country's deepest recession since the second
world war, Mr Mieno cut rates sharply. They now stand at their lowest level
ever in nominal terms, though with inflation now negative, monetary policy
is still regarded by many economists as tight.
The governorship is normally alternated between Bank of Japan and finance
ministry officials. Mr Mieno was a lifelong central banker, and so Mr
Matsushita's appointment would continue the pattern.
An indication that he was on the point of securing the job came earlier
yesterday when Mr Matsushita, who had been the favourite, resigned from the
vice-chairmanship of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce. He had served one
three-year term there and had been expected to serve a second, but such an
appointment would be incompatible with his new role.
Mr Matsushita is due to take over on December 17. The senior deputy governor
will be Mr Toshihiko Fukui, currently a Bank of Japan executive director
responsible for monetary policy.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Japanese students feel jobs squeeze: Recession means a
university education is no longer enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cloistered serenity of one of Japan's more exclusive educational
establishments has been disturbed. Gakushuin University, a sylvan oasis in
Tokyo's concrete desert, has been the alma mater of Japan's emperors for
centuries. Mere mortals have thrived there, too - a degree from Gakushuin is
usually considered a ticket to a safe career in Japan's economic
aristocracy.
But this year, employment opportunities are thinner than ever and a mood of
doubt has punctured the self-confidence of many of the nation's elite
students. According to Mr Makoto Sano, who runs the job placement office,
fewer than a fifth of students have already found jobs - half the number
this time last year, itself one of the worst years ever. The employment
outlook has deteriorated so sharply that the university has for the first
time established special seminars aimed at equipping this year's graduates
with the tools needed to impress would-be employers. 'The students'
situation is more difficult than for many years,' he says
There has scarcely been a worse time to be graduating from a Japanese
university, traditionally the natural pool of labour for the country's
corporations.
Figures published this week by the education ministry showed that the
proportion of university students graduating this March who found employment
slumped to its lowest level since 1950. Just 70 per cent of college-leavers
found jobs in the annual round of company recruitment, down from 76 per cent
last year and nearly 12 points below the peak year of 1991.
The figures do not just demonstrate the severity of the lingering recession.
They herald a significant change in the Japanese labour market as companies
continue the painful process of adjusting to the more competitive climate of
the 1990s. They suggest the secure progress from school to university to
corporation, taken for granted by the nation's graduates, may be a thing of
the past.
The scale of the downturn has been magnified by an atavistic tendency by
Japanese companies to resist redundancies. Faced with falling demand and
excess capacity, the leading employers have all cut recruitment more deeply
than ever.
Toyota Corporation has reduced its graduate intake from nearly 900 three
years ago to an expected 200 this year. NTT, Japan's and the world's largest
company, has frozen recruitment completely. Matsushita Electric is planning
to take on its lowest number of graduates since 1979.
As ever in Japan's male-dominated economy, women have been particularly
affected by the slump in graduate demand. The employment rate for female
university graduates sank this year by 8 points to 67.6 per cent. Since
1991, the average number of job offers per female college graduate has
fallen from 1.98 to 0.87. Labour market-watchers say Japan's women are
entering an 'employment ice age'. According to a report by the Japan
Productivity Centre this year, 51 per cent of graduate-recruiting companies
were expecting not to recruit women at all.
What alarms many students, male and female, however, is that when the
economy at last recovers from the long recession, companies will have a
different set of objectives that will exclude many of them. The education
ministry says: 'Structural changes are now affecting the employment of
graduates; the numbers are likely to fall further yet.'
The shift of manufacturing production offshore in response to the high yen
and the need for businesses to trim costs to remain competitive will weaken
demand for labour. There is as yet little prospect of an end to the
principle of lifetime employment and so smaller graduate numbers and more
early retirements are the only means by which payrolls can be slimmed.
But, more importantly, Japanese companies are becoming much more choosy in
their recruitment. When employment prospects do improve, the chances are
that job opportunities for graduates will be less rosy. According to one
employment consultant, businesses for years snapped up the annual supply of
graduates, investing vast capital in them in the expectation that they would
produce a long-term return over a lifetime of employment. Now, he says,
companies are operating on a shorter timescale.
'Companies are becoming more inclined to tap the pool of already qualified
labour and see earlier returns on their investment. They see new graduates
as expensive, illiquid assets. Better to have fully functioning liquid
assets on your books.'
University careers advisers like Mr Sano are already advising students that
this means a good university education, even from the best universities, may
no longer guarantee a job for life in one of the Japanese corporate giants,
as has always been the widespread assumption. Like the corporation itself ,
Japan's graduate will need to adapt and compete more energetically than in
the past. Unless of course, he can become an emperor.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Vietnam branch status for two US banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Hanoi Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam yesterday approved in principle branch status for Citibank and Bank
of America, allowing the two big US banks to do business in Vietnam for the
first time since they were forced to abandon the country in 1975.
An official from the country's central bank, the State Bank, confirmed that
both banks would be able to upgrade their representative offices in the
capital, Hanoi, and in Ho Chi Minh City, to full branches once the technical
details had been sorted out, a procedure common to all foreign branch
applications.
Both banks have had representative offices in the capital, Hanoi, and in the
southern industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City since early 1993. Although they
applied for full branch status shortly after President Bill Clinton removed
the trade embargo on Vietnam last February, the approval process has been
dictated largely by the pace of normalisation of relations between the two
countries.
'We wish it had been given to us much earlier but we are pleased to have got
it nevertheless,' said Mr Chuyen Uong, Citibank's representative in Hanoi.
Vietnam and the US last month agreed to establish diplomatic liaison offices
in each capital by year's end.
Officials from both banks said they expected their branches to be up and
running by early next year. The bulk of their business would be wholesale
banking and, in the case of Bank of America, advising the government on
financing the rebuilding of Vietnam's crippled power sector.
'I think they're sending a positive message to the US,' said Mr Luu Le, Bank
of America's Indochina manager who, like Citibank's Mr Chuyen, is of
Vietnamese origin and managed a branch of his bank in the then Saigon before
the communist victory in the Vietnam war forced them to close down.
The Citibank and Bank of America branches bring the total number of foreign
branches to 11 in this country of 72m. About 20 more applications are
understood to be in the pipeline but banking analysts say there are signs
that Vietnam is starting to look overbanked and that few foreign branch
licences are likely to emerge for the time being.
State Bank figures show that combined loans among foreign banks amount to
only Dollars 100m (Pounds 62m). Most of them are short-term loans. Bankers
say they are reluctant to lend to state-run or even private Vietnamese
companies whose accounts are murky at best and where recourse to collateral
has not yet been tested.
They are also still smarting from the imposition last year of an unpopular
turnover tax applied to foreign banks.

The United Nations yesterday launched a Dollars 106m appeal for humanitarian
aid for Afghanistan amid fears that the onset of winter will soon bring
additional suffering to the country. With no end in sight to the battles
between militia groups which have plagued the country since the departure of
Soviet troops in 1989, the UN is making desperate efforts to relieve the
misery for ordinary Afghans, including 500,000 who have abandoned their
homes in the past year.
Most have fled the capital, Kabul, which has lost a third of its population
since January 1 when rival commanders began battling for control of the
city. In addition, the UN is helping about 3m refugees still living in camps
in Iran and Pakistan and about 2m who have returned to Afghanistan. UN
officials say that even taking into account Bosnia and Rwanda, Afghanistan
remains their biggest relief operation in the world. The latest appeal will
fund operations until next autumn and follows a similar appeal which raised
Dollars 60m last year.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Egypt-IMF talks to resume
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Egypt will resume formal talks with the International Monetary Fund this
year, to try to break a deadlock over devaluation of the Egyptian pound. An
IMF mission is expected in Cairo before Christmas to discuss devaluation and
a raft of other issues, including reform of Egypt's tax and trade policies
and the pace of its privatisation programme.
Agreement to give new impetus to formal negotiations followed brief talks in
Cairo this week between Mr Atef Sidki, Egypt's prime minister, and Mr
Stanley Fisher, the new IMF managing director. The IMF has been pressing
Egypt to devalue the pound as part of its three-year-old structural
adjustment policies, saying the currency is as much as 40 per cent
overvalued and seriously impedes attempts to generate export-led growth. The
government has refused, saying devaluation would shatter hard-won confidence
in the currency, which in turn has contributed to strong inflows of
expatriated Egyptian money and reserves now topping Dollars 16bn.

Indonesia's first aircraft to be designed and built by the state-owned PT
Industry Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) was rolled out yesterday in an
elaborate ceremony presided over by President Suharto. Development of the
N-250, a 70-seater turboprop aircraft 10 years in the making, has been
criticised by the World Bank which is urging Indonesia to invest in
industries where profitable returns are more certain.
There are concerns that it will be difficult to sell the N-250 on the
international market. However, Mr B J Habibie, Indonesia's research and
technology minister, said yesterday that IPTN, in which Dollars 950m (Pounds
580m) has been invested over the past 18 years, had signed a letter of
intent with Gulfstream International Airline of the US for an order of four
N-250s and an option on six more. Press reports earlier this year said FFV,
a Swedish leasing company, had signed a memorandum of understanding to buy
24 N-250s for delivery in early 1996. In addition, three domestic carriers,
Sempati Air, Merpati Air and Bouraq Airlines, yesterday ordered 16 N-250s
with an option for 162 more.

South Korea expects to apply to join the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development next month, the finance ministry said
yesterday. An application would follow Seoul's acceptance - expected by the
end of the month - as an observer on the OECD's financial market committee.
Negotiations are planned to start in the second half of 1995, with a goal of
membership approval by June 1996. However, they are expected to be
contentious, since the OECD is demanding that plans for financial
liberalisation be accelerated, while Korea argues that this would harm the
economy. Seoul is planning to phase out state-supported industrial loans and
deregulate interest rates, while opening financial markets gradually to
foreign investors and cutting curbs on capital flows. North Korea yesterday
gave a cool response to South Korea's recent move to resume economic
co-operation. A commentary by Pyongyang's central news agency demanded that
Seoul apologise for suspending economic ties over the nuclear dispute and
repeal its national security law before co-operation could begin.

<TEXT>
Any hopes of establishing 'open skies' between New Zealand and Australia
were dashed yesterday. Transport ministers from both countries acknowledged
that a 1992 memorandum of understanding giving Air New Zealand access to
Australia's domestic market from November 1 will not proceed. Mr Laurie
Brereton, Australia's minister, said the accord would now go no further than
the existing concessions allowing Air New Zealand to pick up the equivalent
of 12 jumbo-jet loads of passengers in Australia each week and take them to
another overseas destination.
Mr Maurice Williamson, his New Zealand counterpart, conceded the climate had
changed since the agreement had been signed, in part because of the planned
floatation next year of the Australian government's remaining 75 per cent
stake in its flag carrier, Qantas. Air New Zealand's entry into the
Australian domestic market, as a second competitor alongside Ansett, would
almost certainly have disrupted Qantas's domestic revenue flow.
Australia 'froze' the memorandum unilaterally two weeks ago. There has been
speculation that the Australian authorities were keen to encourage a tie-up
between Ansett and Air Zealand, thus extending the duopoly which exists in
Australian air services across the Tasman.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Bank goes to bat for Taiwan: The mixing of banking with
diplomacy
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mixing banking with diplomacy may seem a curious enterprise but for
ChinaTrust Commercial Bank, but it has to be done.
Controlled by one of Taiwan's wealthiest and most influential families, the
island's biggest privately-owned bank is building an international presence
by dovetailing its strategy to become a 'global Chinese bank' with the
isolated government's efforts to improve its relations with foreign
countries. Just 29 mostly small nations now recognise Taipei instead of
Beijing, rivals since 1949.
To begin with, ChinaTrust plans a network stretching from South America to
the Indian subcontinent and from London to Jakarta. It will later aim to
widen its reach to South Africa, Russia, Australia, Canada, Mexico and
eastern Europe.
By the end of the year, ChinaTrust expects to open branches in Hong Kong,
New Delhi and Paraguay. Soon thereafter it plans to set up representative
offices in Hanoi and Tokyo, buy into joint venture banks in Indonesia and
the Philippines, apply to open a branch in New York, and apply to open
offshore banking units in Thailand and Malaysia. The bank has five
representative offices - in London, Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok and Hong Kong -
and recently established a securities company in London.
'Our mission is not just to make profits, but also to play a
quasi-diplomatic role,' concedes Mr Wu Ching-mai, senior executive
vice-president in charge of international banking. 'Of course, Taiwan's
efforts to gain recognition internationally was one of the important
original motivations behind our overseas expansion, but at the same time it
makes good business sense.'
Cosy ties between business and government are common in Taiwan, but
ChinaTrust's owners, the Koo family, are especially entwined with the
governing Nationalist party. The clan patriarch and head of the family's
diversified business interests, Mr Koo Chen-fu, chairs the Straits Exchange
Foundation, a nominally private organisation that conducts Taipei's
arm's-length political dialogue with Beijing begun in April 1993. He is also
a member of the ruling party's central committee.
His nephew and ChinaTrust's chairman, Mr Jeffrey Koo, doubles as an
unofficial ambassador-at-large for Taiwan in part through his role as head
of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce. The foreign
ministry allocates funds to support Mr Koo's quasi-diplomatic endeavours,
which include meetings with heads of state and other political figures whom
Taiwan's leaders are unable to see because of China's objections.
'As Taiwan is severely limited in its official relationships,' says Mr
Parris Chang, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive party and a
member on the foreign affairs committee of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, or
parliament, 'you find that Taiwanese businessmen often have more clout and
much better access than government officials. For many years, CF Koo served
as Taipei's unofficial foreign minister, and Jeffrey has inherited this role
from his uncle.'
Seen as one of the few Taiwanese banks with the potential to become a truly
international bank, ChinaTrust recently retained Mr Samuel Hsieh, who
finished a term as governor of Taiwan's central bank at the end of May, to
help the bank consolidate its international links.
ChinaTrust's strong push into south-east Asia is designed to complement the
government's 'Go South' policy, an effort to divert Taiwanese investment
flows away from China and into south-east Asia. President Lee Teng-hui added
impetus to the initiative with his 'vacation diplomacy' tour of several
countries in the region earlier this year. Taiwanese investment in China has
surged in recent years to an estimated USDollars 20bn, and Taipei fears
becoming economically dependent on China.
'Our philosophy is to become a global Chinese bank, meaning we will serve
markets where there are Chinese communities and Chinese investment,' says Mr
Wu. 'Taiwanese companies tend to be unknown quantities outside Taiwan so
they can't get banking services in many countries. We can help them
facilitate business by taking collateral here in Taiwan.'
India is the one exception. 'We're going there because it's a place where we
think Chinese ought to go, and we're confident they will, now that India has
decided to open its economy,' Mr Wu says. 'In all other instances, we're
following our clients.'
Taiwan has opened a trade office in the Indian capital, and India is
expected to open a similar office in Taipei soon.
The bank's planned branch in Paraguay is not as improbable as it may appear
at first glance. The Taiwan government is assiduously courting Asuncion with
offers of economic assistance, and ChinaTrust's presence should bolster
reportedly wobbly ties with the only government in South America to maintain
formal diplomatic relations with Taipei.
'There's a strong desire on the part of both governments to increase the
flow of Taiwanese investment into the country,' says Mr Wu. 'As well, we
feel Latin America is changing for the better. There are a lot of Chinese
immigrants in the region, and we want to use Paraguay as a regional centre
from which to look at Brazil, Argentina and Chile.'
ChinaTrust's strength is likely to be in Asia, where Taiwan is becoming an
important provider of both investment and, increasingly, debt financing
capital. Taiwanese banks are beginning to join syndicated loans and will
play a role in regional debt issues as capital markets become more
developed.
Trade flows are following investment flows in Asia, where Taiwan is already
the second or third largest foreign investor in many countries and the
biggest investor in Vietnam. 'I think you'll begin to see business groups
from across the region teaming up to invest in third countries,' says Mr Wu.
'It's all about sharing risks. That's how Taiwan's industry was built.'

<TEXT>
The United Nations yesterday launched a Dollars 106m appeal for humanitarian
aid for Afghanistan amid fears that the onset of winter will soon bring
additional suffering to the country. With no end in sight to the battles
between militia groups which have plagued Afghanistan since the departure of
Soviet troops in 1989, the UN is making desperate efforts to relieve the
misery for ordinary Afghans, including 500,000 who have abandoned their
homes in the past year. Most have fled Kabul, which has lost a third of its
population since January 1, when rival commanders started battling for
control of the city. In addition, the UN is assisting about 3m refugees
still living in camps in Iran and Pakistan and about 2m who have returned to
their homes in Afghanistan. UN officials say that even taking into account
Bosnia and Rwanda, Afghanistan remained their biggest relief operation in
the world. The latest appeal will fund operations until next autumn and
follows a similar appeal which raised Dollars 60m last year.
The officials, who visited Kabul this week, described life in the city as
grim, with shortages of food, fuel and medicines compounding the effects of
frequent rocket bombardments and street fights. They said about 120,000
people were still living in the districts directly under attack, mostly
because they were too poor to move anywhere else. With the temperatures
dropping, they face cold and hunger, particularly as relief supplies to the
city have been repeatedly interrupted by a blockade imposed by mujahideen
fighters.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Indonesian aircraft rolls out

<TEXT>
Indonesia's first aircraft to be designed and assembled by the country's
state-owned aircraft maker, PT Industry Pesawat Terbang Nusantara, was
rolled out yesterday in an elaborate ceremony presided over by President
Suharto. Development of the N-250, a 70-seater turboprop aircraft 10 years
in the making, has been criticised by the World Bank which says the
Indonesian government would do better to invest its money in industries
where profitable returns are more certain.
There are concerns that it will be difficult to sell the N-250 - a pet
project of Mr B J Habibie, Indonesia's minister for research and technology
 -on the international market where it will compete with the models and
services of long-established turboprop aircraft makers.
However, Mr Habibie said yesterday that IPTN, in which Dollars 950m (Pounds
580m) has been invested over the past 18 years, had signed a letter of
intent with Gulfstream International Airline of the US for an order of four
N-250s and an option on six more. Press reports earlier this year said FFV,
a Swedish leasing company, signed a memorandum of understanding with IPTN
for the purchase of 24 N-250s for delivery in early 1996. In addition, three
domestic carriers, Sempati Air, Merpati Air and Bouraq Airlines, yesterday
ordered 16 N-250s with an option to order a further 162.
Mr Habibie said he was looking for a US location to set up an assembly plant
for the aircraft and said General Electric of the US had agreed to take a 10
per cent equity stake in IPTN's US venture. Mr Habibie also said he was
talking to Boeing, which was considering taking an equity stake in the
planned US plant. The plant would be 40 per cent owned by IPTN and is
expected to make its first delivery of a US-assembled Indonesian-designed
aircraft in the second half of 1998.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea expects to apply for membership in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development next month, the ministry of finance said
yesterday. The application would follow Korea's acceptance as an observer on
the OECD's financial market committee, which is expected to be granted by
the end of November.
Seoul plans to begin formal negotiations to become the OECD's 26th member
during the second half of 1995, with a goal of having its membership
approved by June 1996. But the negotiations are expected to be contentious,
since the OECD is demanding that Korea accelerate its schedule for financial
liberalisation, while Seoul argues that any such move would be detrimental
to the economy. Seoul is planning to phase out state-supported industrial
loans and deregulate interest rates, while opening up financial markets
gradually to foreign investors and reduce controls on capital flows. But the
full extent of these measures are not scheduled to occur until after 1996.
North Korea yesterday gave a cool response to South Korea's recent decision
to resume economic co-operation with Pyongyang. A commentary by the North
Korean central news agency demanded that Seoul should apologise for
suspending economic ties with Pyongyang over the nuclear dispute and repeal
its national security law before co-operation could begin.
But South Korean officials said the statement appeared to be a routine
propaganda attack and did not amount to a total rejection of Seoul's offer.
They noted that the commentary had not been issued by any government agency
officially responsible for inter-Korean affairs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sri Lankan prime minister, swept home by
nearly 2m votes yesterday in the country's presidential election, in what
she called a victory for democracy and peace.
'It is a clear mandate for the peace process started by our government,'
said Mrs Kumaratunga. 'This was significant as it was done in the face of a
strong and inflamatory campaign undertaken by major opposition parties to
fan racial violence in hopes it would get more votes.'
Mrs Kumaratunga, candidate for the ruling People's Alliance, received 4.7m
votes or 62.28 per cent to emerge as winner of the 'battle of the widows' by
a big margin.
The opposition United National party's (UNP) Srima Dissanayake, widow of the
assassinated original candidate Gamini Dissanayake, polled 2.7m votes.
Mrs Kumaratunga, the first woman to win a presidential election in Sri
Lanka, will be sworn in tomorrow to replace the UNP's Dingiri Banda
Wijetunga, officials said.
In her new capacity as executive president - a position she has promised to
scrap by July 1995 - she enjoys virtually dictatorial powers.
Her victory showed that voters on the borders of an ethnic war-zone are not
necessarily the most uncompromisingly racist or extremist.
The north-central province which is regularly raided by the secessionist
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam with sometimes entire Sinhalese and Moslem
villages wiped out, voted overwhelmingly for the 'peace candidate'.
Moreover, analysts say the military is now prepared to back her efforts to
secure peace with the Tigers.
Mrs Kumaratunga, 49, had led her party to victory in parliamentary elections
in August, ending the UNP's 17-year rule by promising to bring peace to the
war-ravaged country and cut the cost of living.
The daughter of two prime ministers - she lost both her father and her
husband to the country's bloody politics - Mrs Kumaratunga said her
government would forge ahead with peace but not at the expense of the
majority Sinhalese community.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Exchange rate imprisons Burmese economy: Nationalistic
devotion to a strong kyat is restricting both investment and exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fear of persecution is not an emotion normally associated with seminars on
financial markets, but then Burma's military junta does not preside over a
normal financial system; after 32 years of socialist military dictatorship,
it runs one of the world's poorest and least sophisticated economies.
'It is time to take appropriate steps for the formal opening of a stock
exchange in Yangon (Rangoon),' declared Brig-Gen Win Tin, the Burmese
finance minister, at a recent seminar sponsored by Japan's Daiwa Research
Institute.
But the Burmese bureaucrats, academics and businessmen attending the meeting
were visibly frightened to be asked by a journalist for their views on
Burma's economic policies and the prospects of a stock market. They shuffled
their feet nervously and said they could not speak without official
permission.
Particularly unwelcome were questions about the most urgent financial issue
confronting the junta - the overvalued official exchange rate of the kyat,
the local currency. In theory a dollar buys just under six kyats, but on the
black market it will fetch 115 kyats.
The exchange rate policy of the State Law and Order Restoration Council
(Slorc) - as the junta calls itself - restricts both inward foreign
investment and Burmese exports. Investors and exporters would receive far
too few kyat for their dollars if they ran their businesses in a
conventional manner, and they have been forced to avoid the obstacle by
engaging in complex joint ventures or barter arrangements involving the
export of beans and other agricultural produce.
Slorc's obsession with an artificially strong currency would also block the
disbursement of funds from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the Asian Development Bank, if such funds were not already blocked by
western protests against Slorc's many human rights abuses.
Slorc generals, trained as soldiers rather than economists, talk vaguely of
an eventual 'convergence' between the official and unofficial rates. They
argue that the exchange rate is not a problem because they tolerate dealings
on the black market, but the policy distorts the Burmese economy in several
ways.
The armed forces and state-owned enterprises, for example, are allowed to
import weapons and raw materials at the official rate, which means they pay
unrealistically low amounts of kyats for their imports. And the official
exchange rate is used to calculate all import tariffs, depriving the
government of much-needed tax revenue.
'They are always talking about a market-oriented economy,' says Mr Ho Chin
Beng, chief representative in Rangoon of the Development Bank of Singapore.
'But the one main stumbling block remains the official exchange rate of the
kyat.'
The Slorc's reluctance to tamper with the exchange rate is based partly on
its collective respect for Gen Ne Win, the 83-year-old former dictator who,
from his retirement, is believed to exercise considerable control over
younger generals. He is adamantly opposed to devaluation on nationalistic
grounds.
Slorc generals also fear that a devaluation will boost inflation - already
running at an estimated 40 per cent - and anger the poor by increasing the
cost of basic products such as cooking oil. These are sold by the state
enterprises that currently enjoy a hefty exchange rate subsidy.
In the past few years, Burma's generals have embarked on a series of
economic reforms. They have encouraged foreign investment, eased
restrictions on tourists, liberalised agriculture, legalised the vigorous
border trade with China and Thailand and allowed the establishment of
private banks and private hotels.
Foreign companies, particularly from Singapore and Thailand, have responded
enthusiastically. Twenty big hotels are under construction in Rangoon.
Seventeen foreign banks have been licensed to open representative offices.
Newly-imported second-hand cars are creating the first traffic jams for a
generation. Consumer goods such as televisions are on display in the shops,
and economic growth last year is estimated at 6 per cent.
In its efforts to revive the economy, the Slorc has even risked incurring
Gen Ne Win's wrath by introducing currency notes in sensible decimal
denominations such as 10 and 100. For years the Burmese had to count their
money laboriously in notes of 90 and 45 because nine was the general's lucky
number.
Slorc ministers have also tentatively begun to raise the cost of basic
services for the country's 43m inhabitants towards more realistic levels.
Last year, Rangoon bus fares were doubled to two kyat (about two US cents at
the free market rate); the price of electricity has just increased fivefold,
except for government employees; and the cost of petrol rations (often
resold on the black market) has risen from 16 to 25 kyat per imperial gallon
in the last few weeks.
Reforms implemented so far have encouraged construction and consumer
spending and attracted hoteliers and crafty foreign commodity traders to
Burma. But many Japanese and western companies are reluctant to invest in a
country where the regime is unpopular with its subjects, the banking system
remains primitive, corruption and bureaucracy are rampant and repatriation
of profits depends on the ability to export beans or lentils.
'Things are changing on the surface, but there's no structural change,' says
one Burmese businessman. Rangoon-based diplomats agree, pointing out that
other south-east Asian economies such as Thailand and Indonesia have been
able to succeed despite corruption and military influence because trained
economists and technocrats control macro-economic policy.
This is not the case in Burma. 'The problem is that sooner or later, as all
these niche opportunities created by the reforms are taken up, the whole
system will hit the ceiling and be held back by the structural impediments,'
says one diplomat.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Baghdad recognises Kuwaiti sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq yesterday abandoned its long claim to Kuwait and recognised the United
Nations-defined border in an attempt to pave the way for an easing of
international sanctions, imposed after Baghdad's invasion of the Gulf state
in 1990.
The decision to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 833 was taken by
the National Assembly and later endorsed by the Revolutionary Command
Council. It came a month after the US and its allies deployed tens of
thousands of troops, together with warships and aircraft, to counter a
renewed Iraqi military build-up near the Kuwaiti border.
In a statement released last night the Revolutionary Command Council, headed
by President Saddam Hussein, said that Iraq 'recognises the sovereignty of
the State of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence'.
Iraq also 'recognises the international boundary between the Republic of
Iraq and the State of Kuwait as demarcated by the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait
Boundary Demarcation Commission. . . and respects (its) inviolability.'
Initial international reaction to the Iraqi announcement was cool and early
moves towards an easing of sanctions are not expected.
The US said Iraq's recognition of Kuwait had to be in 'practice as well as
in words' and warned that Baghdad had to comply with other UN resolutions
before sanctions can be lifted.
'If that is, in effect, true in practice as well as in words, that is
positive,' said Mr Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman, 'but there
are a number of other elements in UN resolutions that Iraq must adhere to
before we can even discuss lifting sanctions.'
Senior US officials have previously emphasised that Iraq must comply fully
with all aspects of weapons control and monitoring, account for all Kuwaitis
transferred to Iraq during the occupation, and put an end to repression of
the Iraqi people. Some diplomats have interpreted this as meaning the US
will not support an end to sanctions while Mr Saddam remains in power.
The UN Security Council meets on Monday to review the sanctions and British
officials said yesterday they did not expect any action to be taken.
However, Russia, which played a significant role in persuading Iraq to
announce the recognition of Kuwait, is likely to press for some indication
from the Security Council that it will react positively to Iraq's move. The
National Assembly session in Baghdad yesterday was attended by Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister.
France and China have also appeared sympathetic to rewarding Iraq as it
edged towards full compliance with Security Council demands. But the French
have taken a harder line since Iraq last month moved its forces close to the
Kuwait border.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Sweden's No campaigners get their act together: Hugh Carnegy
sees performers in anti-Europe debate take to the stage as Sunday's EU
referendum remains a tight race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activists for the No campaign, buoyed by opinion polls showing them within
sight of victory in Sweden's referendum on Sunday on European Union
membership, were pulling few punches when they mounted a gala evening for
undecided voters in Stockholm's City Theatre.
One after another, performers of 'The People's Movement against the EU'
invoked alarming images to press their case. One quoted from Vidkun
Quisling, the hated Norwegian wartime puppet leader who co-operated with the
Nazis (most Norwegians consider neutral Sweden did likewise), to show he
favoured European integration. Another sang powerfully at the gala last
Sunday of Nadja, a child victim of war in Sarajevo, linking her fate to 'the
new Europe'.
Claes Fredelius, a member of a Marxist group, went furthest. His indictment
of the EU, traced back to Europe's murderous colonisation of the Americas,
included a reference to the recent Estonia ferry disaster in which more than
800 Swedes perished. The connection to the EU was unclear, but the message
was not: The EU is today's evil empire which threatens to trample Sweden's
superior but fragile folk hem (people's home).
At its most extreme, the No campaign presents a maddingly difficult target
for Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democratic prime minister, his allies (on
the EU issue) in the right-of-centre opposition and the country's industrial
and trade union leaders, despite their dominant position on Sweden's
political heights.
The pro-EU message that membership will help stabilise an economy shaken by
recession and give Sweden its share of influence in a reshaped Europe sounds
at best mundane and at worst defeatist against the No side's appeal to
preserve the traditional lofty Swedish ideals of neutrality, egalitarianism
and universal welfare that were so long championed by Mr Carlsson's Social
Democrats.
The old system may be creaking - with unemployment running at more than 13
per cent of the workforce and the welfare system threatened by a huge budget
deficit equal to 13 per cent of gross national product - but many Swedes are
still reluctant to accept it cannot be made to work again.
Nor is there the same potency in Sweden, which has no border with Russia, to
the worries about future developments in Moscow that helped produce the Yes
vote in neighbouring Finland last month. So people hesitate to take a step
that is seen as an irreversible move away from the 'Swedish model'.
Mr Tomas Segenas, who runs a small lunchtime cafe in Stockholm, is one of
those people. 'I think people are scared of the EU,' he said this week.
'They think Sweden will be too small inside the Union. Yes - they are afraid
that Sweden's way of living will be changed.'
No-one is more conscious of this feeling than Mr Carlsson, who inherited the
leadership of the Social Democratic party in 1986 from the late Mr Olaf
Palme, the very embodiment of the Swedish model. Only in 1991 did Mr
Carlsson overturn decades of Social Democratic orthodoxy by lodging Sweden's
application for membership.
But the persistent suspicion of the EU among Social Democrats - recent polls
suggest fewer than half the party's supporters are convinced Yes voters -
has led Mr Carlsson to run a low-key campaign ahead of Sunday's vote, even
allowing cabinet members to campaign for a No. His judgment is that the way
to win over the undecided is by quiet persuasion, not coercion.
Yesterday, an opinion poll in the newspaper Dagens Industri showing the Yes
side moving into a 52-48 per cent lead suggested he may well be proved
right. But it is a high-risk strategy for there is much at stake on Sunday.
A No vote will make the government's most urgent task of filling the hole in
the public finances more difficult. A sell-off of Swedish bonds and the
krona will almost certainly drive up long-term interest rates, already well
above European averages, requiring deeper spending cuts to control a state
debt approaching 100 per cent of gross domestic product.
Sweden's big international companies such as Volvo, Ericsson and Electrolux
are likely to continue a trend well established for a decade or more of
investing heavily inside the EU, not at home in Sweden. In sectors vital to
Sweden such as the forestry and telecommunications industries, being inside
the EU, able to influence policy and regulations on market conditions and
standards, is of great importance.
Politically, too, much is at stake. Part of Mr Carlsson's low-key approach
has been to protect his position should he be faced with a No vote. Having
led the Social Democrats decisively back to power in September's general
election, he would probably avoid a fall from power if there was a No vote.
But his authority and that of key pro-EU ministers such as Mr Goran Persson,
the finance minister, would be badly damaged. The initiative would shift to
the anti-EU left of the Social Democratic party and, significantly, to the
Left party and the Environment party, whose support the Social Democrats
need for a parliamentary majority. The leftwingers oppose fiscal measures
which hit the welfare system.
Other economic policies currently being reviewed by the Social Democrats,
such as privatisation of Telia, the state telecommunications company, and
energy deregulation, would face sharper opposition.
On Sunday, many of the large numbers of still undecided voters who will
determine the outcome may ultimately choose instead to trust the unanimous
verdict of Mr Carlsson, Mr Carl Bildt, the former conservative prime
minister, and Sweden's industrial leaders that EU membership is essential
for Sweden's economic renaissance. But they will face a tough fight to the
finish.
In the No campaign's scruffy office in the southern city of Malmo last week,
Mr Henrik Skrak, the No side's chief local organiser, made the case that
Sweden's economy was returning to growth this year precisely because it
abandoned in 1992 the EU-oriented policy of pegging the krona to the Ecu.
'Canada depends on exports to the US and is satisfied with the North
American Free Trade Agreement. Nobody in Canada wants to join the US. Why
should we join a united Europe?' he declared.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Jewish writer hears old echoes in the new Germany's
Reichstag

<TEXT>
As befits his age, Mr Stefan Heym walked slowly up to the podium of the
Reichstag in Berlin yesterday. Aged 81, the doyen of east German writers had
been given the privilege of delivering the opening speech of the new German
parliamentary session, as the oldest of the 672 deputies elected to the
Bundestag last month.
The walk to begin his address was heavy with the symbolism and bitterness of
Germany's division and subsequent reunification.
Mr Heym fled Nazi Germany as a Jewish refugee, fought on the side of the
Americans against his country during the second world war, and returned to
east Germany in 1952, disillusioned with the McCarthy witch-hunts. The
communist regime tolerated him as its most truculent writer, but refused to
publish his increasingly critical novels.
But Mr Heym is an independent MP backed by the reformed communist Party of
Democratic Socialism, and thus an enemy of the conservative government. Not
surprisingly, hours before he was due to speak, files made public showed
that Mr Heym had contacts with East Germany's security police, the Stasi.
But the records, apparently released at Mr Heym's request after accusations,
did not prove whether the author knew he was talking to the Stasi when he
offered unspecified information about an east German trade unionist who had
fled to west Berlin but was subsequently kidnapped by the Stasi in the
1950s. Mr Heym said he had never knowingly given the Stasi information.
It was a grim Reichstag that waited for him to begin speaking. He asked for
greater understanding and unity between east and west Germans but dwelt,
embarrassingly, on the past.
'The people of east Germany freed themselves. But there were people who had
weapons to defend the old, unloved system. They did not use these weapons,'
he said. 'We should take this into account when we judge them,' making an
implicit plea for a partial amnesty for those accused of collaborating with
the Stasi.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, and the Christian
Social Union, its Bavarian sister party, refused to applaud. 'It was a hard
decision not to applaud him,' said Mr Rolf Kiefer, CDU spokesman. 'Heym went
on about the crisis instead of looking at the good things of unification. He
never talked about the oppression of the old dictatorship.' But Mr Jurgen
Mollemann, the maverick member of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in
the coalition, said 'the speech was more moderate than I had expected. I
applauded.'
The only ones who applauded en masse were the PDS, and the opposition Social
Democrats, who, in 1990, had opposed German unification.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Strasbourg delays change of guard in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European parliament has forced a delay in the inauguration of the new
European Commission until late January, it emerged yesterday.
The delay means that Mr Jacques Delors will lead a caretaker regime probably
until the last week of January, some three weeks after he was due to step
down as Commission president.
One unexpected result is that he will have a cast-iron excuse for remaining
silent about whether he intends to run for the French presidency in late
spring. Most observers believe this will help Mr Delors, whose high standing
in the polls is attributed partly to his absence from an increasingly messy
battle for the Elysee.
The immediate impact, however, is that next week's planned
Euro-parliamentary hearings to screen the new 21-member Commission are to be
postponed until the first two weeks in January.
The Strasbourg assembly is expected to vote on whether to approve the full
Commission, including Mr Jacques Santer, the new president, on January 18.
The hold-up is the result of a judicious muscle-flexing exercise by Mr Klaus
Hansch, the new president of the assembly.
It underlines his determination to use the leverage over the Commission and
the member states offered by the Maastricht treaty, one of whose powers is
to give Strasbourg the right to approve or reject the Commission as a whole.
During legal exchanges, the parliament insisted that the new Commission must
be endorsed by an assembly drawn from all member states, including Austria,
Finland, Sweden, and Norway.
All four countries are due to enter the European Union on January 1,
assuming that voters in Sweden and Norway approve EU membership in
referendums this month and the accession agreements are ratified by all 12
member states.
The parliament argued successfully that MEPs from Austria and the three
Scandinavian states - who are temporarily designated by their national
parliaments pending Euro-parliamentary elections scheduled for next year -
would have no legal status until January 1 when enlargement takes place.
The hold-up is something of a blow to Mr Santer who had hoped to get off to
a fast start with the new five-year Commission. Late last month, against
expectations, he succeeded in allocating portfolios to the new commissioners
with a minimum of controversy.
More broadly, the parliamentary delay is part of an institutional logjam
which also threatens to delay ratification of the EU's five-year budget.
Member states were due to enshrine the spending plans into domestic law by
the end of the year, but a combination of weak governments and political
opposition in national legislatures could hold up passage.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Germans flexible at last on credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The international credit card may finally have found a home in Germany
despite the best efforts of the German banks to stop it happening.
Credit cards have, for years, had doors slammed in their faces as Germany
clung to its cash and cheque culture. In restaurants, waiters would take
offence at the sight of a card. Shops cashiers would simply refuse to take
them. Even now, despite having made some ponderous headway, there are still
just 9m cardholders in Germany compared with an estimated 37m in the UK.
Now Deutsche Bahn (DB), the state-owned railways, will turn its popular
railcard into a joint venture with Citibank, the US bank which is one of the
world's largest providers of credit cards, offering travellers all the
advantages of a Visa card.
The Bahncard or railcard, which offers half-price travel on the entire
network, was introduced a couple of years ago and already has 3m customers.
Both DB and Citibank forecast Bahncard sales will rise significantly with
the new attractions.
Foreign banks have accused the Germans of using every trick in the book to
keep their cards out of the market.
Citibank says it made DB an offer at the beginning of the year.
The railways, one of the symbols of German efficiency and effective state
stewardship, have been turned into a joint stock company as a first step
towards privatisation and were having to look at new ways of making money,
especially as administering the Bahncard was costing them about DM20m
(Pounds 8m) annually.
Other banks made alternative offers and a final decision was expected in
September.
But then, as Mr Volkert Mindermann, a spokesman for Citibank, put it, 'in
the middle of the night' there was an offer from the Gesellschaft fur
Zahlungssysteme (GZS), a peculiarly German organisation set up by all the
domestic banks to manage Eurocard, the leading credit card in Germany which
has around two-thirds market share.
GZS, representative of the collective nervousness of its owners at a large
and emblematic foreign intrusion into the local credit card market,
apparently offered to hand the entire annual revenues from the card -
estimated at around DM150m - to DB if it were given the business. But they
reckoned without the federal monopoly authorities in Berlin who began making
enquiries to see whether GZS might be creating a cartel (being operated by
too many banks), and before they could open a formal investigation, the
Eurocard offer was withdrawn.
'The German banking community is still fighting against credit cards,' Mr
Mindermann said.
'They think everything can be done with the Eurocheque card and they'll try
anything to keep foreigners like Citibank out,' he said.
Citibank also estimates it will have revenues of between DM100-DM150m a year
which it will share with DB. 'But we need to keep some of the money to cover
our costs,' Mr Mindermann said. But while Citibank has succeeded in ripping
a large hole in the fenced off German market, it may be a while before other
credit card companies will be able to slip through it.
American Express, which has just 1.2m cardholders in Germany, is still
locked in a court battle with the Zentrale zur Bekampfung unlauteren
Wettbewerbs - a title which translates as the Centre for Combating Unfair
Competition - an organisation which has been policing German competition law
since early this century.
This tight policing probably does not surprise American Express. 'It's a
question of habit,' says a local Amex official. 'Germany is very much a cash
society.
'It was also difficult when they first introduced cheques and it was even
more difficult to persuade people to use cash machines' in the eighties, she
said.
The Zentrale hauled American Express in a year ago for offering another
company's products (free flights) in an attempt to boost its own sales.
That, said the Zentrale, was a breach of the Zugabeverordnung, a law which
forbids the offer of free gifts with the sale of goods.
American Express has since had to stop marketing the promotion.
They are still 'optimistic' that they will win the court case but are
wondering why the Zentrale has not, in the meantime, taken action against
Lufthansa, the national carrier which offers a promotional package including
car rental and hotel stays from companies which are not their own.
American Express would not comment.
But it may just be that the German national carrier is having a blind eye
turned towards it, while outside competitors remain in the fixed gaze of the
authorities.

Ethnic Hungarians in Romania yesterday criticised a new law which provides
for up to three years' jail for those flying foreign flags or singing
foreign anthems in the ethnically mixed Balkan state. MPs from the ethnic
Hungarian party said the provision, passed by parliament on Wednesday, was
anti-democratic and violated European ethnic rights agreements. They said
they would appeal to the country's constitutional court and to the Council
of Europe. Parliament's decision is the latest sign of the growing influence
of nationalist politicians who formally joined the left-wing minority
government in August. It comes as the Senate, the upper house, is preparing
a bill which would require foreigners to register with the police within 48
hours of arriving in Romania. It would also empower the interior ministry to
restrict foreigners' movements on grounds such as national security and
'public morale'.

<TEXT>
President Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday sacked Mr Piotr Kolodziejczyk,
defence minister, at the request of Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister.
The dismissal of Mr Kolodziejczyk - a 55-year-old retired navy admiral who
has been defence minister since the new leftist government was formed a year
ago - follows a conflict between the civilian minister and the military over
spending, reforms and control of the army. President Walesa had asked Mr
Kolodziejczyk to resign after military officials criticised the minister
during a meeting at a battlefield in Drawsko Pomorskie on September 30. The
minister had refused and had the backing of parliament in what was seen as a
struggle between the president and the cabinet over control of the military.
However, Mr Pawlak yesterday unexpectedly wrote to the president requesting
his dismissal. Mr Pawlak said Mr Kolodziejczyk had failed to 'normalise the
situation in the defence ministry'. The move comes two days after Mr Joseph
Kruzel, the US deputy assistant defence secretary, gave his backing to the
minister on a visit to Poland.

The battle between President Boris Yeltsin and his prime minister, Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, which has been waged through proxies over the past week in a
prolonged cabinet shuffle, was stepped up yesterday when a senior
presidential adviser attacked Mr Chernomyrdin's austere 1995 budget. Mr
Alexander Livshits, a recently appointed Yeltsin adviser who was described
by one Russian newspaper yesterday as more influential than any cabinet
minister, told a press conference that the budget was too tough.
'The price of implementing such a budget will be too high,' Mr Livshits
said. 'I don't think the end justifies the means.' Mr Livshits criticised
the government's proposal to put a moratorium on the soft central bank
credits which pushed the monthly inflation rate up to 15 per cent in
October. He said the government's plan to raise money through bonds, which
have recently experienced poor demand despite rapidly rising prices, was
unrealistic. Mr Livshits said long-term plans to slash inflation to western
levels were unrealistic. 'I see no reason why we should not have 15 to 20
per cent inflation a year in the next few years,' he said.
When the cabinet endorsed it last month, the austere budget was hailed as a
sign that Russia was at last prepared to swallow the tough fiscal and
monetary medicine which has turned around the economies of eastern Europe.
But it could be derailed by Mr Yeltsin's covert criticisms and the even
stiffer resistance it is expected to face when it is presented to parliament
later this year.

<TEXT>
With artillery fire occasionally audible in the distance, representatives of
the Bosnian Serbs have gathered in Pale, above Sarajevo, to consider how
much freedom of action to give their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic.
Yesterday, after two days of debate behind firmly closed doors, it was clear
that the Bosnian Serb 'parliament' would stop well short of declaring a
state of war throughout its territory in Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic - facing mixed fortunes on the battlefield, a boycott by his
former protectors in Belgrade, and isolation from the wider world - would
like carte blanche to wage all-out war. But fearing a dilution of its
authority, the makeshift assembly has forced him to limit the scope of any
declaration of emergency rule to those areas most immediately at risk from
the latest fighting.
Officials say the formal state of war will apply only to some 50 per cent of
Serb-controlled territory.
'Of course, you can always expect resistance,' said an official close to the
Pale leadership. 'People got scared by all this talk of declaring war. But
we have to prove to the Moslems that they cannot win.'
Mr Karadzic said before yesterday's debate that he would assume certain
powers from the assembly but insisted there was no question of it being
dissolved.
The parliament has often been dismissed as a rubber stamp for the Bosnian
Serb leadership, but it does represent Mr Karadzic's link with a population,
part of which is not always necessarily behind him. He cannot afford to be
seen ignoring the interests of the representatives. Officials admit that
absenteeism and black marketeering, sometimes across enemy lines, have
resulted in military weakness.
The new measures will include more efficient mobilisation (which has already
begun), restrictions on civilian movement and introduction of martial law.
Local government will be concentrated in small groups of officials, directly
answerable to Mr Karadzic. 'It will not be a classic state of war, but a
semi-state of war,' said Mr Aleksa Buha, the 'foreign minister'. 'This is a
very serious decision. We don't want to do it too fast.'
Punishments for desertion and dereliction of duty are likely to be
toughened. On Wednesday, Mr Karadzic said several brigade commanders
responsible for losing territory near the north-western enclave of Bihac had
already been replaced for disobeying orders.
Since Serbia severed relations with the Bosnian Serbs in August, Mr Karadzic
has conducted periodic purges of the army and police, aimed at rooting out
those who might not think twice about taking their orders from Belgrade. An
official in Pale said the dismissals were 'a normal consequence' of the
breakdown in relations.
But it is clear that the Bosnian Serb leader's personal feud with President
Slobodan Milosevic has led him, rightly or wrongly, to suspect those around
him.
Reuter adds from Zagreb: Croatia hinted yesterday that it might attack rebel
Krajina Serbs if they keep firing from Croatia across the border at Moslems
in Bosnia. Krajina Serb artillery has been hammering government positions in
Moslem-populated Bihac since Tuesday and a Krajina Serb jet launched two
missiles into Bihac town yesterday. 'We believe Croatia will do something if
this continues,' said Mr Gojko Susak, defence minister.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Lisbon diplomat to head WEU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Cutileiro, a senior Portuguese diplomat whose candidacy enjoyed the
support of Britain, was appointed yesterday to the top job at the Western
European Union, a nine-nation security club of growing importance.
The choice of Mr Cutileiro, 59, who joined the Portuguese foreign ministry
after Lisbon's democratic revolution in 1974, marked a success for London's
drive to boost Europe's defences in a way that avoids weakening Nato.
Yesterday's choice of secretary general, taken by a meeting of ambassadors
in Brussels, will be formally endorsed when WEU foreign and defence
ministers gather at Noordwijk in the Netherlands on Monday to discuss ways
of upgrading the organisation.
Two rival candidates - the Italian ambassador to Nato, Mr Giovanni Jannuzzi,
and Mr Enrique Baron Crespo, a Spanish Socialist politician - stepped aside
after initial soundings showed that Germany had swung behind Mr Cutileiro.
France - the strongest advocate of an independent European defence capacity
 -initially backed Mr Jannuzzi but gave away after the Germans opted for the
Portuguese candidate, who already enjoyed UK and Dutch backing.
Diplomats said the two unsuccessful candidates had decided not to insist on
a definitive vote which would have damaged the fledgling institution's
credibility.
'It would have looked bad if somebody had won in defiance of several major
countries,' one diplomat commented.
The WEU is already involved in naval operations to enforce the international
embargo against the former Yugoslav republics, and it is also setting up a
police force in the divided city of Mostar.
But its role - hitherto dwarfed by Nato - looks certain to grow as the US
partially disengages from Europe and the European Union develops a common
foreign and security policy.
Britain has set aside its earlier doubts about the organisation, and it now
sees the WEU as a useful way of developing defence relations with its
continental allies, including France which is outside the military wing of
Nato.
Mr Cutileiro - who won acclaim in his homeland by writing a doctoral thesis
at Oxford University on inequality in southern Portugal - will have to
bridge the gap between French zeal and British caution over upgrading the
WEU.
But he comes up from a country whose views on European security overlap
considerably with those of the UK.
Both Britain and Portugal want to avoid creating fissures in eastern Europe
by rushing to draw some ex-communist states into the western security system
while keeping others out.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After 2 1/2 years of war, the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday
devoted a second day to the question of whether to make the conflict
official.
Despite waging a brutal conflict against Moslem and Croat enemies, and
incurring Nato air strikes, the Bosnian Serb leadership has never formally
declared war. But recent setbacks on the battlefields, coupled with the
effects of a three-month political and economic blockade by neighbouring
Serbia and Montenegro, have forced the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan
Karadzic, to impose new discipline.
Fearing a dilution of its authority, the makeshift parliament in Pale, above
Sarajevo, has forced Mr Karadzic to limit the scope of a declaration to
those areas most immediately at risk from the latest fighting. Political
sources in Pale say the formal state of war will apply only to half the
Serb-controlled territory.
'Of course, you can always expect resistance,' said a source close to the
Pale leadership. 'People got scared by all this talk of declaring war. But
we have to prove to the Moslems that they cannot win.'
The parliamentary session was conducted in private. Journalists were kept at
arms' length by order of Mr Sonja Karadzic, daughter of the Bosnian Serb
leader.
Mr Karadzic said before the debate continued yesterday that he would assume
certain decision-making powers from parliament, but insisted there was no
question of the assembly being dissolved.
As the Serbs come under military pressure he needs to take care. The
parliament has often been dismissed as a rubber stamp for the Bosnian Serb
political and military leadership, but it does represent Mr Karadzic's link
with the people, not all of whom are always behind him. He cannot afford to
be seen to be ignoring their representatives.
Officials admit that absenteeism and black marketeering, sometimes across
enemy lines, have resulted in military weakness. While Serbs enjoyed
overwhelming superiority in the field, and Moslems and Croats fought among
themselves, the problems were not acute. But recent events have injected a
note of urgency.
The new measures will include more efficient mobilisation - this has already
begun - restrictions on the movement of civilians and the introduction of
martial law. Local government will be concentrated in the hands of small
groups of officials, answerable to Mr Karadzic.
Punishments for desertion and dereliction of duty are likely to be
toughened. On Wednesday, Mr Karadzic said a number of brigade commanders
responsible for losing territory near the north western enclave of Bihac had
already been replaced for failing to obey orders.
With the sound of artillery occasionally audible in the placid streets of
this impoverished mountain resort, military uniforms seem more prevalent
than ever. Local radio programmes carry upbeat stories of the fighting
interspersed with detailed reports on the availability of food throughout
the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic.
Since Serbia severed relations with the Bosnian Serbs in August, Mr Karadzic

FT  11 NOV 94 / Amato job splits Italy's coalition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Socialist premier, has been appointed to head
Italy's five-man anti-trust commission, the ultimate arbiter of any conflict
of interest between the role of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister and
his ownership of the Fininvest financial and media empire.
This is the first time the six-month-old Berlusconi government has offered a
sensitive appointment to an opposition figure, and the move has divided the
rightwing coalition.
But, given the unresolved conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's
political and business roles, the move is a clear attempt to recover
credibility. It represents a move by moderates in the government to bring
the coalition towards the middle ground and pave the way for an alliance
with centrist parties in the opposition with whom Mr Amato identifies.
Significantly, the choice of Mr Amato to head the anti-trust commission
follows the serious divisions within the rightwing coalition caused by the
refusal to nominate Mr Giorgio Napolitano, previous speaker of the chamber
of deputies and a member of the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS), as one of Italy's two new European commissioners.
The decision to appoint Mr Amato was formally taken by Ms Irene Pivetti, the
speaker of the chamber and member of the populist Northern League; but it
was backed by Mr Berlusconi. Yesterday, the move was criticised by the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance as well as by individual members of the
league and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement.
The appointment comes at a time when the government finds itself running
into increasing problems of conflict of interest over the management of the
Rai, Italy's troubled state broadcasting organisation. On Tuesday, the
government approved the summary removal of Mr Gianni Billia, brought in only
95 days ago to be director-general of the Rai alongside Mrs Letizia Moratti,
the new chairman.
Mr Billia felt uneasy about Mrs Moratti's management style and the choice of
programme and channel managers, several of whom had links to Mr Bettino
Craxi, the former Socialist leader.
He also fell out over Mrs Moratti's plans to sell off some of the Rai's
transmission facilities which threaten to weaken the role state television
could play in developing multimedia activities - and benefiting Mr
Berlusconi's three commercial channels that account for almost half the
national television audience. At least one other Rai board member has
resigned and others could follow.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: French inflation stays low
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French consumer prices rose by between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent last
month, giving a relatively stable annual inflation rate of just under 1.7
per cent, according to Insee, the national statistics office. The monthly
rise, in line with expectations, reflected an increase in prices for fresh
foods. Most other sectors, including manufactured goods and public sector
services, showed a slower rate of increase than in October 1993. The release
of the inflation statistics coincided with an Insee survey which showed a
small decline in French consumer confidence last month. Officials said the
decline reflected increased concern about the persistence of high
unemployment, despite broader economic recovery. In September, unemployment
increased by 14,000 to a record high of 3.35m, or 12.7 per cent of the
workforce.
Russia's economy showed the first signs of rebound in three years last
month, with gross domestic product growing 4 per cent from October 1993
after falling 14 per cent year-on-year in September. Last year, GDP
contracted by 12 per cent.
German retail sales in September rose a real 1 per cent from August, but
year-on-year they were down 1 per cent.
Norway's consumer prices rose a stable 1.7 per cent in October year-on-year.

employees at Oberkochen in Baden-Wurttemberg and 2,000 at Jena in Thuringia.
Management at Carl Zeiss, manufacturer of optic and scientific instruments,
wants to cut losses of more than DM140m (Pounds 57m). Some DM100m of the

Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the head of the controversial MMM investment fund, has
begun to set up his own parliamentary faction by attracting members from the
Liberal Democratic party (LDP) of ultranationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky
while he is touring the US. Mr Mavrodi, who won a parliamentary by-election
on October 30, and Mr Alexei Mitrofanov, deputy LDP leader, want to create a
new faction to push for legislation to counter the 'arbitrariness' of
government. To be recognised by the state duma, or lower house of
parliament, the new group will need to recruit at least 35 deputies. Mr
Mitrofanov, the foreign minister in Mr Zhirinovsky's shadow cabinet, said
the new group, People's Capital, had signed up 16 deputies, most of them
from the LDP. The new faction probably will be led by Mr Mavrodi, who spent
several months in jail and is under investigation for tax evasion.

Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, one of France's largest construction and utilities
groups, said yesterday it was halting political contributions following a
series of corruption investigations which have shaken French business and
political circles.
The announcement is the most significant move so far by French companies
which are seeking to defuse allegations of corruption. It could push other
large business groups to adopt a similar policy ahead of next spring's
presidential elections. Generale des Eaux, the principal rival of Lyonnaise
des Eaux, said yesterday it was reviewing its position on campaign
financing.
Utilities and public works companies are the largest corporate contributors
to political campaigns. Through their subsidiaries, some of them have been
linked to investigations of illicit financing of political parties.
Subsidiaries of Lyonnaise des Eaux, have been investigated in a case which
forced the resignation in July of Mr Alain Carignon, the former
communications minister.
Mr Carignon faces charges of receiving funding for his political campaigns
from a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux in return for public works contracts
in Grenoble, where he is mayor. Lyonnaise des Eaux denies any wrongdoing.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, said yesterday that laws
relating to company contributions to political parties were complex and
unclear. He had decided 'to suspend all contributions to political parties
until new laws are promulgated to clarify appropriate conduct in this area'.
The move reflects concern among leading French business groups. 'It shows a
defensive attitude,' says Mr Francois Morin, director of Lerep, the economic
and political research institute. 'The large utilities groups have been
destabilised by the climate of corruption.'
The utilities groups are taking other steps to redress their image. Generale
des Eaux is drawing up a code of ethics relating to the conduct of company
officials in seeking public works contracts. It said yesterday it favoured
legislation either to prevent the direct financing of individual candidates
or restrict party financing to the national level.
The National Federation of Public Works is preparing a code by which its
6,000 member companies would promise not to offer bribes to win the FFr150bn
(Pounds 18bn) of public contracts they carry out each year. Bouygues, a
large construction group, has resisted the proposal and the implication of
previous wrongdoing, comparing the proposal to 'a motorist promising, from
tomorrow, to obey the highway code'.
However, the spate of corruption investigations which have prompted two
ministerial resignations and seen leading businessmen placed under
investigation, has prompted calls for stronger action. An all-party
parliamentary committee is discussing banning direct corporate funding of
political parties.
At present, a 1990 law limits to FFr500,000 the amount that a company can
donate to a political party. But the payment of donations through
subsidiaries has enabled groups to make much larger overall contributions.
In the 1993 parliamentary elections, for example, Lyonnaise des Eaux donated
about FFr7.7m to political parties.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Ulster killing shakes peace process: Dublin cancels plan for
early release of nine IRA prisoners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN,  and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government abruptly halted the planned pre-Christmas release of
nine IRA prisoners after a post office worker in Northern Ireland was shot
dead yesterday by suspected republican gunmen.
The shooting, the first since the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries declared
ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process.
It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up
their efforts to secure the surrender of paramilitary weapons.
Reaction to the murder was generally restrained, though Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, accused the Royal Ulster
Constabulary of trying to damage the peace process by blaming republicans
for the shooting. The IRA said its position on the two-month-old ceasefire
remained unchanged.
Dublin's decision to cancel the release orders for the IRA prisoners was
announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister, after a
meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. It came less than
24 hours after her department gave details of the men to be freed as part of
the Irish government's response to the IRA's ceasefire.
An embarrassed Dublin government said it had stopped their releases because
initial reports from the RUC suggested 'the possible participation' of
Provisional IRA members. Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn said the planned releases had
been 'based specifically on the premise that the Provisional IRA campaign of
violence was over for good'.
However after a cabinet meeting, government sources insisted the peace
process would not be derailed by the killing.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered'
by the 'callous and wicked' murder. It demonstrated, he added, 'the wanton
dangers of illegally held arms'.
The attack took place in Newry, Co Down. Three armed men, dressed as postmen
and using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee,
Mr Frank Kerr, 53, was shot dead after a struggle. Two of the armed men were
later arrested after a chase involving helicopters near the Irish border.
The third escaped and was last night being sought by police.
Sinn Fein insisted last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and
did not represent a breach of the ceasefire.
Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the
raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans committing a
straightforward criminal act to make some money.
A statement from the IRA implied as much, asserting simply: 'On August 31
the IRA announced a complete cessation of military operations. All our units
were instructed accordingly. This position has not changed.'
Mr Adams was said to be 'visibly shaken' when told of the raid by a
reporter.
Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish
officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope
will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province.
Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss
the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday.
British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid
surrender of weapons. Mr Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour party
MP for Newry, said: 'It was an IRA operation whether it was sanctioned or
not by those they call their leaders.'
His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on
legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area
unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

FT  11 NOV 94 / Sears to spin off insurance subsidiary to shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sears Roebuck, the US retailing giant, is to distribute its 80.1 per cent
stake in Allstate, its insurance subsidiary, to its shareholders in one of
the largest US corporate spin-offs, valued at more than Dollars 8.5bn
(Pounds 5.2bn).
The move completes a two-year restructuring that has changed the
Chicago-based group from a diversified merchandising and financial services
conglomerate back to being a pure retailer, which is how it began.
The latest move has been prompted in part by the big losses inflicted on
Allstate by recent natural disasters in the US, said Mr Edward Brennan,
Sears' chairman.
The insurer estimates its losses from January's Californian earthquake at
Dollars 1.3bn, while Hurricane Andrew in 1992 cost it Dollars 2.7bn.
The sharp swings in Allstate's earnings have added to pressure from
shareholders for the group to be divided, allowing the retailing and
insurance businesses to be valued individually.
Sears also said that Mr Brennan, aged 60, who has been chairman since 1986,
is to retire when the Allstate spin-off is complete. The restructuring was
started reluctantly by Mr Brennan under pressure from shareholder activists.
Sears plans to distribute its remaining 360m shares in Allstate, the US's
second-biggest car and homes insurer as well as a leading life insurance
company, in a tax-free distribution to shareholders in mid-1995.
Sears sold an initial 19 per cent of the insurer's Allstate's shares in a
public flotation last year. It founded the insurance company in 1931 to sell
car insurance through Sears' catalogues and stores.
The move closely resembles the disposal last year of Sears' stockbroking and
credit card business, Dean Witter Discover. After floating 20 per cent of
the shares, the remainder were spun off to Sears' shareholders.
Sears said it was also consider ing selling its commercial property arm,
Homart, next year. The business had 1993 revenues of Dollars 234m and losses
from continuing operations of Dollars 11.4m.
Yesterday's announcements lifted Sears' share price by Dollars 2 3/4 , to
Dollars 51 3/8 , while Allstate dipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 1/8 .
Last year, Allstate contributed Dollars 1.2bn to the Sears group's Dollars
1.7bn of earnings. But Allstate's profits have been shattered by Dollars
1.3bn in customer claims for earthquake losses this year, resulting in
Dollars 845m in after-tax charges. Its net income for the first nine months
of 1994 was Dollars 320.7m, or 71 cents a share, down sharply from last
year's Dollars 1bn or Dollars 2.42 a share.
The company intends the aggregate dividends paid by Allstate and Sears after
the spin-off to equal Sears' current annual dividend of Dollars 1.60.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Hurd broke law over Pergau aid, High Court says: Pounds 234m
allocation for Malaysian dam project was 'fatally flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds
234m from the UK overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia, the
High Court ruled yesterday.
The court said the grant of aid was 'fatally flawed' because the project was
'economically unsound' and did not promote the development of a country's
economy as required by aid laws.
The Overseas Development and Co-operation Act says the primary purpose of
aid must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or welfare of its
people.
The ruling was the second defeat for government ministers in the courts in
two days. On Wednesday, the Appeal Court ruled Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, had acted 'unlawfully' and 'abused his powers' by introducing a
new compensation scheme for victims of crime.
Labour said the two judgments demonstrated the government's growing contempt
for parliament.
Downing Street greeted yesterday's decision with dismay, but dismissed
attempts to link it with the judgment against Mr Howard.
The government was refused leave by the judges to appeal. The Foreign Office
said it was considering whether to apply to the Appeal Court directly for
permission to challenge the ruling.
Mr Hurd said the contribution to Pergau would go ahead. He said the
government would provide the money from elsewhere if the appeal failed.
'We are contractually bound; there are 200 British firms working there,' he
said on Channel Four news. 'Unless we have a successful appeal, we will have
to find other ways of financing it.'
Mr Hurd said the legality of the deal was not questioned when he signed it.
'The courts decide and the law has to be obeyed. Ministers have to take a
view on what they can do in the national interest. That is what I sought to
to do,' he said.
The decision was a victory for the World Development Movement, a lobby group
for the Third World, which had argued that Mr Hurd overstepped his powers by
allocating aid money to promote trade with Malaysia.
Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, promised to provide financial help for
the dam in 1989 while negotiating a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal with Malaysia.
Mr Hurd authorised the first instalment in 1991 despite advice from Sir Tim
Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development
Administration, that the funding was 'an abuse of the aid programme'.
In Malaysia yesterday, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, warned of
retaliation if the UK government was forced to drop the Pounds 234m loan. He
added that if the loan payment was held up, Malaysia would withhold payment
to Balfour Beatty, the British company which is the main contractor on the
dam.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow foreign secretary, said the judgment 'reveals the
Conservative government as incompetent, and so arrogant with power that they
broke the limits of their legal authority'.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Charities facing long delays for funds from lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Sieff, chairman of the National Lottery Charities Board, admitted
yesterday that the board, which could have Pounds 100m a year to distribute
to charities, may not start making grants until late next year.
The admission came a week before the first multi-million-pound National
Lottery draw takes place on November 19. Twenty per cent of the proceeds of
the lottery will be distributed to UK charities via the board, and up to
200,000 applications for money are expected each year.
There is growing concern, however, that delays may mean that the board may
not be in a position to accept applications until 'the latter half of next
year', according to Mr Kirk Coulson-Gilmer, acting secretary,
'It's a shambles. An absolute disgrace,' a lottery specialist, who asked not
to be named, said yesterday of the progress so far.
Mr Sieff, a director of Marks and Spencer, admitted yesterday: 'If we are
going to succeed we need time to prepare - certainly many months - before we
can begin the actual distribution of funds.'
Money will be held in interest-bearing accounts until grants are made. Mr
Sieff added that he would not be put off from doing the job properly 'either
by media pressure, or by the understandable anxiety or impatience of
possible recipients of grants'.
At the moment the board is staffed by four civil servants on secondment from
the Home Office, although consultants with expertise in business systems,
management and public relations have also been engaged. Advertisements for a
chief executive were placed two weeks ago.
There have also been complaints that charities trying to contact the board
have only been able to reach an answering machine. Calls have been going
instead to Camelot, the lottery operator, and the Office of the National
Lottery.
At a meeting last week attended by Camelot and Charities Board
representatives, it is believed that Camelot asked what callers to the
Lottery Hotline should be told about the Charities Board. A board member
suggested they be asked to call back in a few months.
The Charities Board agreed that its address, 7th Floor, St Vincent House, 30
Orange Street, London WC2H 7HH, could be given out but not its 071-839 5371
telephone number.
The problem has been caused partly by the apparent slowness of the Home
Office in making appointments.

FT  11 NOV 94 / Dublin halts IRA prisoner release: Prominent republicans
held after post worker shot in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government abruptly rescinded the planned release of nine IRA
prisoners before Christmas after two prominent republicans were arrested in
Northern Ireland after the murder of a post office worker yesterday.
The shooting, the first since the IRA and Loyalist paramilitaries declared
ceasefires, cast a shadow over the Northern Ireland peace process.
It will almost certainly increase pressure on London and Dublin to step up
their efforts to secure a dismantling of paramilitary arsenals.
Dublin's decision to cancel the early release orders for the IRA prisoners
was announced by Mrs Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, the Irish justice minister,
after a meeting with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he was 'deeply angered'
by the 'callous and wicked' murder. There would be 'very natural suspicions'
as to the motive for the crime.
The attack took place in Newry. Three armed men, dressed as postmen and
using a post office van, entered a fenced sorting centre. An employee was
shot dead. Two of the men were arrested after a chase involving helicopters
near the Irish border. The third escaped and was last night being sought by
the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
The RUC said the two men arrested were reported to be known republicans. But
Sinn Fein indicated last night that the raid was not the work of the IRA and
did not represent a breach of the two-month-old ceasefire.
Republican sources in South Armagh, a strongly nationalist area, said the
raid was the work of renegade, freelance republicans commiting a
straightforward criminal act.
Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, was
reported to be 'visibly shaken' when told the news by a reporter. He said:
'The RUC is engaged in a transparent attempt to damage the peace process.'
A statement from the IRA said: 'On August 31 the IRA announced a complete
cessation of military operations . . . This position has not changed.'
Yesterday's killing came on the eve of a meeting between British and Irish
officials to discuss the framework document which the two governments hope
will form the basis of a durable political settlement in the province.
Sir Patrick and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, are to discuss
the document in the Republic of Ireland on Monday. There have been signs in
recent days that the two governments have made progress - particularly in
the area of north-south relations - after a period of little progress.
British and Irish politicians said the shooting showed the need for a rapid
surrender of weapons.
Mr Seamus Mallon, MP for Newry for the moderate nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party, said: 'All we do know for certain is that these
people had a certain close relationship with the IRA, that they had weapons,
and they had very clearly planned this operation . . . the same kind of
operation they have used before.'
His view was echoed by Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party spokesman on
legal affairs. He said: 'Freelance operations don't take place in that area
unless they're licensed by the IRA.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cuomo's defeat hits Lilco shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the Long Island Lighting Company, a private-sector US electricity
company, tumbled by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/4 in early trading, a
decline of more than 8 per cent, following the defeat of Mr Mario Cuomo, the
state's Democratic governor, in the US mid-term elections.
Last month Mr Cuomo proposed to buy out Lilco's shareholders at Dollars
21.50 a share and take the the company into state ownership in an attempt to
cut electricity bills.
However, the plan looks unlikely to go ahead under New York's new Republican
governor, Mr George Pataki.
Mr Cuomo said Lilco's electricity rates, the highest in the US, would fall
by 10 per cent if the company were nationalised because it would no longer
have to pay federal taxes or shareholder dividends.
Later this month Lilco's electricity rates are due to be reviewed, but the
New York Public Service Commission, the state body that sets electricity
rates, is not expected to permit any increase.
Shareholders fear the result will be declining company profits and a cut in
the dividend.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer raises Fl 90m in
placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hagemeyer, the Dutch products and food trading group, has raised Fl 90m
(Dollars 52.9m) of new capital in a private placement of 677,617 ordinary
shares, AP-DJ reports.
The issue, announced earlier this year, will increase the total number of
shares outstanding by 4.7 per cent.
The Naarden-based group also announced it had placed a Dollars 45m,
five-year, floating-rate exchangeable subordinated note issue with Dutch
institutional investors. The notes, designed to improve the structure of
debt rather than increase the burden, are exchangeable into minority equity
at the option of Hagemeyer.
'Both transactions fit Hagemeyer's financial aim to keep its shareholders'
equity at a level of between 25 and 30 per cent of balance sheet total,'
Hagemeyer said.
Its Hong Kong parent company, First Pacific, participated in the share
offering to hold its stake unchanged at 50.04 per cent.
The remainder of the newly-issued common shares have been placed with a
small number of foreign and domestic investors, who paid a price at market
average.
Hagemeyer, which has expanded this year through the takeover of UK
electro-technical wholesaler Newey &amp; Eyre and a joint venture in Asia, said
it expected earnings per share to rise in 1994, from last year's Fl 11.37.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Caretaker world trade role seen for Sutherland: Early
decision on his successor is unlikely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, is believed to be ready to stay on in a caretaker role as
head of the future World Trade Organisation if the contest for his successor
remains deadlocked.
Mr Sutherland, whose official term ends in July next year, has stated he
will not be a candidate for director-general of the WTO, which is expected
to begin work on January 1.
It now appears unlikely that a decision on his successor will be made by
early next month, when Gatt members are due to endorse the appointment. This
will make it virtually impossible for the new head to start in January.
Although no formal proposal to stay on has yet been made to Mr Sutherland,
it is being discussed by trade diplomats anxious to assure a smooth
transition from Gatt to the more powerful WTO. However, some officials hope
the decision on the choice of WTO chief can still be made by next month.
A third round of consultations among Gatt members on the appointment will be
held in Geneva this week.
Trade officials said yesterday they expected the outcome to be a continued
three-way split on regional lines between Mr Renato Ruggiero, the EU
candidate, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the outgoing Mexican president who
has US and Latin American backing, and Mr Kim Chul-su of South Korea who has
Asian support.
Although Mr Ruggiero is ahead numerically, the eventual decision must be
made by consensus. Delays in ratifying the WTO and the associated Uruguay
Round of global trade accords, the continued stalemate over the next OECD
secretary-general and the lack of engagement of the US in the WTO race are
all seen as obstacles to consensus.
To these must now be added uncertainty over the outcome of the Uruguay Round
vote by the US Congress in three weeks' time. A rejection by Congress would
certainly kill the WTO, which could not operate effectively without the
participation of the world's biggest trader.
Of Gatt's 124 members, only about 30 countries have so far ratified the
world trade pact, and they do not include any of the Quad group of leading
traders - the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. Most have been awaiting the US
decision.
The mid-term elections and the impending Uruguay Round vote have also kept
the US out of the active horsetrading that will be a part of an eventual
deal.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Sweden's PM pledges more jobs if voters back EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, yesterday stepped up his
hard-pressed campaign to win approval for Swedish membership of the European
Union in Sunday's referendum, promising an urgent government programme to
increase employment if there is a Yes vote.
'Immediately after a Yes in the referendum, the government will formulate a
programme to promote more sustainable employment in industry . . . This work
will be done in constructive co-operation with the labour market partners,'
he said in a newspaper article.
Meanwhile, Mr Carlsson and his fellow Social Democratic leaders in Denmark,
Finland and Norway issued a joint declaration on Tuesday night asserting
that if Denmark's Nordic neighbours joined it in the EU, social democrats
would strengthen their influence inside the Union.
The Danish, Norwegian and Swedish governments are led by social democrats
and the Finnish Social Democratic party is expected to win a general
election next March. Finland has already voted to join the EU and Norway
will hold a referendum on November 28.
Pro-EU campaigners have this week urged Mr Carlsson - who celebrated his
60th birthday yesterday - to work harder to win over the many Euro-sceptics
in his own deeply-split party to help overcome a strong Swedish anti-EU
campaign in Sunday's vote.
The left-dominated No side, which some recent polls have suggested is in the
lead, has argued that anti-inflation policies steered by right-of-centre
governments in the leading EU countries have been responsible for high
unemployment within member states.
The No campaign claimed yesterday that entering the EU could cost as many as
340,000 jobs in Sweden, on top of the 575,000 - more than 13 per cent of the
workforce - already unemployed.
It said the financial cost of Swedish membership, coupled with the effect of
bringing down value-added tax to EU levels, would eventually force the
country into deep public sector cuts.
In his article in Dagens Nyheter, Mr Carlsson countered that the EU was
committed in its policy document of last year to working towards lower
unemployment. Joining the EU would give Sweden financial stability and
encourage investment.
'These are the conditions - reasonable interest rates and a more secure
investment climate - that create new possibilities to fight against
unemployment. It is these conditions that I quickly want to take advantage
of after a positive result in the referendum,' he wrote.

Iran said its fighter aircraft had raided guerrilla bases in Iraq yesterday.
An Iranian Kurdish rebel party said one of its camps inside a western no-fly
zone in Iraqi Kurdistan was pounded by Iranian jets. Four Iranian fighters
'severely bombarded' a base of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan in
Koi Sanjaq, 60km from the border, killing a woman resident of the town and
wounding three people, the party said in a statement. On Sunday Iran fired
at least three Scud missiles at the main base of the Mujahideen Khalq
opposition group 80km inside Iraq.

Economic growth in the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development this year is expected to be slightly higher
than the 2.6 per cent increase in gross domestic product forecast in July,
according to officials at the organisation. Mr Tsutomo Tanaka, vice-chairman

been generally favourable. He declined to make a new forecast, but said
growth was expected to edge up to 2.7 per cent. For 1995 and 1996, Mr Tanaka
said growth would be about 3 per cent.
The improved outlook partly reflects a stronger performance in continental
Europe. 'The recovery has picked up and is now better established,' said Mr
Tanaka. The Japanese economy is also reviving, albeit slowly, the OECD said.
The trend partly reflects maintained easy monetary conditions and a series
of short-term fiscal stimuli.
In the US, however, the pace of expansion has slowed, according to the
economic policy committee. But it said that this was appropriate given the
risk of overheating and the general desire to see a sustained expansion of
output and employment.

FT  10 NOV 94 / AT&amp;T in Mexican joint venture

<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, and Grupo Alfa, a large Mexican industrial
conglomerate, are to form a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) joint venture to
provide telecommunications services in Mexico.
The new company, of which Alfa will own 51 per and AT&amp;T 49 per cent, plans
to invest about Dollars 1bn in telecommunications during four to six years,
and to begin operations next year. It will apply for a licence to offer
long-distance services from January 1997, when Mexico's telecommunications
market is to open to full competition.
Mexico's telecommunications are valued at about Dollars 7bn a year, with
about Dollars 4bn accounted for by domestic and international long-distance
traffic. The long-distance segment is expected to grow rapidly over the next
decade, as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
AT&amp;T becomes the fourth large US telecommunications carrier this year to
agree to ventures in Mexico. MCI is to form a company with GF Banacci,
Mexico's largest financial group; Sprint with Iusacell, a cellular company;
and GTE with GF Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, and Visa, a large
industrial holding company. All are hoping to enter the lucrative
long-distance market.
The alliance between Alfa and AT&amp;T has raised questions about the long-term
strategy of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the current monopoly long-distance
and local carrier. Telmex had been expected to reach a long-distance
agreement with AT&amp;T. Telmex's share price fell after the announcement was
made public, with analysts concerned that its ability to compete in the
North American telecommunications market would be hampered without a strong
US partner at its side.
Alfa, a Monterrey-based conglomerate with business interests in steel, food,
packaging and petrochemicals, posted sales last year of Dollars 2.5bn. The
company has more than 15 joint ventures with leading international
companies, and follows a strategy of diversified growth in Mexico.
The Mexican government recently established in principle that there would be
no limits to the number of competitors it would allow in the long-distance
telephone market.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: Mirandolina - Theatre in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good playwrights write for actors, bad playwrights despite them. Carlo
Goldoni (1707-93) wrote scores of plays that were gifts for actors - but
gifts that challenged them. So it is dismaying to feel the Lyric
Hammersmith's new version of his Mirandolina fall flat. The Goldoni
productions I have seen have taught me that, though you can stage Goldoni in
a wide variety of ways, the key factor is vitality. Without spontaneity,
without intensity, Goldoni evaporates, and we are left with little to watch
but crummy old formulas. (Like Shakespeare and other great playwrights,
Goldoni was forever reworking received material.) Here, the six actors all
seem to be working in different styles, and everything is laborious.
Mirandolina, an innkeeper, is very successful at getting men to fall in love
with her - but she has to work hard to vanquish the Cavaliere, an avowed
misogynist. She is no mere seductress; she has streaks both of the feminist
and the androphobe. The air should be full of intelligent contest. Here,
however, Caroline Quentin makes Mirandolina's methods so obvious that the
Cavaliere (Reece Dinsdale) seems a dolt. The lines do not dance (though
Quentin tries to make them do so); the actors underrate both Goldoni and the
audience. They project forcefully into the theatre, but, because the
personalities they project are stale, the effect is meagre.
The director is Dalia Ibelhauptaite. She directed a decent staging of
Goldoni's The Impresario from Smyrna at the Old Red Lion this spring:
decent, I now suspect, mainly because the tiny stage space gave the play an
intensity that is utterly absent here. The most successful element of
Mirandolina is also the most bizarre: Ashley Martin-Davies's scenery, which
includes surreal effects - eg a blue piano hanging in the air - and daring
clashes of colour. For the seduction scene, an orchard of suspended separate
fruit descends to head height: so that Mirandolina lead the Cavaliere
through a Hanging Garden of Eden, giving him bites of one apple after
another.
But Designer's Theatre cannot carry Goldoni. Did Ibelhauptaite intend to
elicit any correspondingly surreal acting style from her cast? If so, she
has not succeeded. As the Conte, Graham Turner commits several cheap crimes:
he employs a plebeian accent in an aristocratic role, he uses blatantly
modern movements within exaggerated period costumes, and he tries making the
same joke several times. The hangdog Robert Goodale is miscast as
Mirandolina's important servant Fabrizio: no spark, too old. Tim McMullan's
Marchese is that worst theatrical type, a dull fop.
Nobody listens to anybody else with any liveliness. Robert David Macdonald's
new translation omits some minor characters, and, with them, some shrewd
comedy. The English text has some clever 'quotations' from Shakespeare -
usually, however, juxtaposed with unstylish expressions such as 'I mean'.
Poor Goldoni's clever play about one woman's efforts to win the battles of
love and power has crumbled into a feeble English sex comedy in period
frocks.

Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has lowered the long-term debt ratings
of Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, to Aa3 from Aa1, affecting about Dollars
825m of debt securities, AP-DJ reports.
The downgrade concludes a review begun on July 11, after Lilly revealed its
intention to purchase the PCS Health Systems business from McKesson, the US
healthcare group, for Dollars 4bn. Moody's said the downgrade recognised the
heavy debt burden Lilly would undertake to complete the acquisition as well
as the uncertainty whether incremental profits attributable to PCS would
generate attractive investment returns.

mainly to stronger commodity markets, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Earnings totalled CDollars 31m (USDollars 23m), or 31 cents a share,
compared with a CDollars 19m loss, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Revenues
climbed to CDollars 1.65bn from CDollars 1.26bn. Brascan forecast a further

office shake-up
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon, the parent company of Wall Street securities house Salomon
Brothers, announced yesterday that it may have to take a charge against its
earnings in the fourth quarter because of 'unreconciled balances' in its
books that were discovered during a reorganisation of the company's
back-office systems.
In its filing of third quarter results with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Salomon said the charge might affect its operating results, but
would 'not be material to the company's financial condition' - an indication
that the company believed the problem would not seriously affect its
finances.
Although Salomon would not elaborate on a brief statement which said that
any net after-tax impact of any charges related to the unreconciled balances
would be 'insignificant,' sources close to the company said there was no
indication that the discrepancies resulted from fraud.
The imbalances were said to have been discovered while the company was
shifting its back-office technology from overloaded central processing
mainframe computers to a more flexible network of powerful personal
computers.
The bookkeeping mix-up comes at a difficult time for Salomon, which has been
hit by large losses on its investment banking and trading business this
year.
In the first nine months of 1994, the parent company lost Dollars 242m.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Public offer for Renault 'set to
be oversubscribed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The public offer for shares in Renault, which closes tonight, is set to be
oversubscribed, Mr Alphandery, the French economy minister, said yesterday.
The first estimates of demand from private investors, which are being
allotted the majority of the shares on offer in the partial privatisation of
the motor group, had been encouraging, he said.
However, the minister indicated that the level of subscriptions could be
less than in previous privatisations. He said that the partial nature of the
operation, which will leave the French government with just over 50 per cent
of Renault's shares, and depressed stock market conditions, could limit the
number of applications from private individuals.
'I am confident about the operation,' he said, adding that it was too soon
to give a precise figure for the level of subscriptions.
Final figures for applications in the public offer will be announced next
Wednesday.
Previous issues in the government's programme of privatising 21
publicly-owned groups, have drawn strong demand from private investors. Elf
Aquitaine, the oil group, attracted 3m investors when it was privatised
earlier this year, while Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals
company, drew 2.9m investors when it was sold at the end of 1993.
Institutional investors have also shown strong demand for the privatisation
issues. In the case of Renault, the shares allocated to institutions have
been subscribed more than 15 times.
At FFr165 a share, the motor group is valued at just under FFr40bn (Dollars
7.81bn), lower than the FFr45bn to FFr50bn valuations given by some motor
industry analysts.
Including the receipts from Renault, the sale of public sector assets had
already netted the government about FFr103bn, he said.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Bus company in administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Darlington Transport Company, a council-owned bus operator, went into
administration yesterday in the wake of fierce competition between rival
operators in the County Durham town.
Mr Nick Wallis, chairman of the council's transport committee, said: 'The
financial viability of DTC has been smashed beyond repair.'
The Labour-controlled council blamed the government's deregulation policy
and the sales process it has imposed on council-owned bus companies for the
collapse of the 90-year-old business, which faces liquidation.
But it also blamed Stagecoach, the Perth-based company which this week
started offering free travel for five weeks in Darlington, largely on the
same routes as DTC.
Stagecoach has registered to run services in the town from December 12. The
company, which obtained a Stock Exchange listing last year, has often
clashed with the competition authorities.
Fierce competition erupted between bus companies in many cities when the
1985 Transport Act became law. It swept away many restrictions and allowed
new operators to compete for business.
In July, when DTC had an annual turnover of Pounds 2.6m, net assets of
Pounds 400,000, 60 buses and 140 employees, the council offered it for sale
by open competitive tender.
Of 10 indicative offers it selected three companies - Badgerline, Stagecoach
subsidiary Busways and Yorkshire Traction. Last month Yorkshire Traction,
which submitted the highest price, was chosen as preferred bidder.
But, the council says, Stagecoach then acquired Cleveland Transit, a move
which emphasised its acquisition strategy. Busways then started recruiting
DTC drivers to work in Darlington, offering a Pounds 1,000 bonus, higher
basic rates of pay and three years' job guarantee. By last Friday about 70
DTC employees had resigned.
Last week Yorkshire Traction and Badgerline withdrew their bids for DTC.
Stagecoach refused to comment yesterday.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Rise in non-EU exports sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government aims to increase the proportion of exports that go to
countries outside the European Union as part of its strategy for stimulating
domestic growth.
Ministers want to increase non-EU exports to more than 50 per cent of the
total before the next general election, due by 1997. They are keen to
promote British exports to relatively fast-growing economies in Asia and
Latin America.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, is due to leave for India on Sunday, at
the head of a party of more than 80 business executives in what the
Department of Trade and Industry is billing as its biggest-ever trade
mission.
Official figures indicate that the government is well on the way to
achieving its target. In the eight months to August exports to the EU
amounted to Pounds 46.3bn, or 52.6 per cent of the total. This compared with
Pounds 63.9bn (52.7 per cent) in 1993 and Pounds 58.9bn (57 per cent) in
1991.
Last October non-EU exports of Pounds 5.28bn marginally outstripped exports
to EU countries, at Pounds 5.26bn. This was the first month in which this
had happened for more than three years.
Next year's expected enlargement of the EU may make the target more
challenging than it appears. The way is clear for four European countries -
Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria - to join the EU in January.

The New Zealand political outlook changed dramatically early today when Mr
Jim Anderton announced his surprise resignation as leader of the left wing
Alliance party. Mr Anderton had been widely expected to lead the party, a
grouping of left wing and green parties, to victory in the 1996 election. A
former president of the Labour party, he resigned because of Labour's right
wing economic policies in 1988, to form the Alliance. Until recently it had
enjoyed top poll ratings among political parties. Mr Anderton's daughter
committed suicide during last year's election campaign, and at a press
conference today he said he wished he had resigned then. Mr Anderton said he
would stay as MP until the next election and work for an Alliance victory.

The bolsa shed some of its earlier gains after market expectations of an
alliance between AT&amp;T and Telmex were broken when AT&amp;T said it was setting
up a Dollars 1bn telecommunications venture with Grupo Industrial Alfa.
Traders said the market was buying Telmex ahead of AT&amp;T's announcement but
guessed wrong. 'The announcement that the alliance was with Alfa halted the
demand for Telmex and that moderated the market's advance,' one said. But
the news boosted Alfa, which advanced 5 per cent. Telmex 'L' series shares -
those available to foreign investors - were off 1.02 per cent at 9.74 new
pesos.
The IPC index closed only 7.0 points up at 2,618.94 after a high of 2,632.
Volume was 1.12bn new pesos on 80.8m shares traded.

Last minute withdrawals in the contest to enter the Spanish mobile telephone
market have narrowed the field to two consortia, which will deliver their
bids on Monday. The licence, to be awarded before the end of the year, is
the first significant step in a deregulation process that, over the next
three years, will introduce cable television and end Telefonica's monopoly
as a national basic telephony operator.
The latest defections include Repsol and Gas Natural, the two leading
Spanish energy companies, and the US operators BellSouth and GTE. A rapid
realignment leaves two consortia. One has Air Touch of the US and BT of the
UK as its technological partners and is backed by Banco Santander and Banco
Central Hispano as principal shareholders; the other groups the UK's Racal
Vodafone and Germany's Veba with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and retail chain Corte
Ingles and media group Prisa among other partners.

FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utility worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utility stocks moved against a strong market trend after Mr Gordon Brown,
the shadow chancellor, stressed Labour party plans for a windfall tax on the
privatised water and electricity companies.
Norweb closed 4 lower at 812p and Midlands Electricity surrendered 8 to
780p. Yorkshire Electricity softened 3 to 740p, although Northern Ireland
Electricity contrasted by finishing 6 stronger at 375p on talk of a
break-through in the framework for peace talks in Northern Ireland.
Among water shares, Thames retreated 7 to 503p and Anglian, which reported
figures earlier this week, gave up 10 at 524p. Southern was 8 lower at 589p,
while Northumbrian slipped 8 to 696p ahead of today's interim figures.
Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett said the reaction of the stocks to the
speech 'serves to remind investors of the political risks attached to
utility stocks'.
Commercial Union was restrained by market caution following third-quarter
results. The profits of Pounds 305m were near the top of the range of
forecasts, but Credit Lyonnais Laing said it showed that CU's rate of
improvement had slowed and some analysts argued that the 20 per cent premium
of the share price to net asset value was too high. The shares closed
unchanged at 543p, while Royal Insurance, reporting today, firmed 2 to 300p
and General Accident eased 2 to 581p.
Cable and Wireless shed 7 to 392p in turnover of 13m as analysts moved
rapidly to downgrade profits forecasts following a disappointingly weak
interim performance from the group's Mercury arm.
The group as a whole turned in half-time growth of 11 per cent but Mercury,
hit by price competition from BT and regulatory pressure on revenues, saw
operating profits slide 3 per cent. NatWest Securities promptly chopped its
annual profits estimate for C&amp;W by Pounds 90m to Pounds 1.1bn, and anecdotal
evidence suggests that some other houses took an even more cautious line.
BT, which unveils interims today, and Vodafone were clear beneficiaries of
some heavy switching out of C&amp;W, with the former up 8 1/2 to 393p on 8.1m
shares traded and Vodafone gaining 6 at 211p.
High street retailer Boots retreated 4 to 516p, with Smith New Court
reported to have turned negative on the stock and been the day's main seller
of the shares.
A story doing the rounds suggested that Boots had rejected an offer for its
pharmaceuticals division of DM2.5bn from BASF, the German chemicals group,
because it did not want the company to be relocated away from its Nottingham
headquarters.
High street clearing bank Barclays moved up 9 to 598p as it confirmed that
it was in negotiations with the New England bank Shawmut National over the
sale of its US subsidiary Barclays Business Credit. Press reports have
suggested the sale could reap between Dollars 200m and Dollars 400m.
Furniture group MFI, 4 1/2 higher at 137p, responded to a strong
recommendation and upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The broker raised its
current year profits forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 97m.
Marks and Spencer stayed weak following Tuesday's cautious comments from the
company surrounding the release of interim results. The shares eased 2 1/2
to 401 1/2 p.
Hopes of a shake-up in UK gaming laws, hinted at by the Home Secretary, led
to demand for several stocks. Ladbroke, which publishes its third-quarter
trading update today, firmed 4 to 153p and Rank Organisation 10 to 403p.
Also better on the same speculation was London Clubs, which added 8 at 261p.
The world's biggest glassmaker, Pilkington, receded 4 to 188p, with a
sizeable line of stock said to be overhanging the market.
International trading conglomerate Lonrho had another hectic day, with 3.9m
shares traded and the stock gaining a further penny at 152 1/2 p.
Since the announced departure of joint chief executive Mr Tiny Rowland, the
shares have put on 15 per cent and some brokers now feel uneasy with a
prospective p/e ratio approaching 30. NatWest Securities is one of the more
sanguine houses, estimating break-up net asset value at 175p.
Amersham International slid 63 to 928p as analysts reduced forecasts in the
wake of disappointing interims. The range of full-year estimates came back
to between Pounds 47m and Pounds 50m.
Campari International recovered 4 to 25p as it was announced that a company
known as Blueridge Ltd had acquired almost 11 per cent of the leisure and
sportswear group. Campari was trying to establish last night who was behind
Blueridge and whether the stake had been acquired for investment purposes or
prior to a bid approach.

FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: US poll boost for drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading pharmaceuticals companies dominated the business in London as
traders reacted enthusiastically to the political changes in the US and the
consequent jump in the dollar.
The Republican victories were perceived to have removed the threat to
pricing and profits posed by the Clinton health care reforms. There was a
rush of London buying and some dealers suggested that one heavy-hitting US
mutual fund was also piling into the sector via the anonymity of the
inter-dealer broker (IDB system).
However, analysts commented that the political moves were unlikely to have
much impact on an industry which had already been forced to change. Managed
care groups, which provide health care to around 55m Americans, have
discovered their buying power over the past few years and forced prices
down.
Mr Paul Krikler of US investment bank Goldman Sachs said: 'It is clear that
the political changes have given a sentiment boost to the sector but, for
the longer term, we would focus on the changes already in the market place.'
SmithKline Beecham was the most heavily traded stock in the market with
combined turnover in the 'A' shares and Units hitting 18m. The 'A's rose 12
1/2 to 421 1/2 p and the Units 11 to 382p. Glaxo jumped 19 1/2 to 617p on
turnover of 15m shares, although 4m of those represented one side of a
tax-related deal. Fisons, up 5 at 121p and continuing to attract bid
speculation, saw 8.7m shares dealt in the underlying market and was the most
heavily traded stock option on the Liffe. Wellcome rose 20 to 664p and
Zeneca 14 to 871p.

FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Election news gives strong boost to
equities - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A burst of strength by the dollar, which helped stimulate a round of big
gains across international bond markets, provided the perfect trigger for a
London stock market primed to move ahead yesterday.
The wave of Republican victories in the US mid-term congressional elections
set the scene for international markets, with the dollar racing higher as
the election news swept around the world, boosting bond and equity markets.
The euphoria produced by the dollar saw the FT-SE 100 Index penetrate the
3,100 mark in midsession before coming off the top minutes before the close
of trading and settling a net 35.8 up at 3,099.6.
The late downturn in London came in the wake of a sharp setback on Wall
Street, where the Dow Average, up 38 points shortly after the opening, was
virtually level as London closed and down almost 10 points an hour or so
afterwards.
Traders in London professed concern at the slide on Wall Street, which they
said led to some determined selling of the Footsie future after hours. 'We
felt very firm all day, but things are getting confused now; Wall Street
remains the key to European markets,' said one dealer. He added that the
next phase of the series of US bond auctions, which total Dollars 29bn,
would be crucial to the market's performance, as would the Bundesbank
meeting today.
A senior marketmaker at one of the big European securities houses adopted a
more positive view of the market, taking the view that a bout of
profit-taking had been expected after a near 50-point rise in the market. 'I
think we'll be fine, as long as we can hang on to close above 3,100 at the
end of the week,' he said.
One real bonus for the market post the US elections was the sharp increase
in the level of business yesterday. Turnover expanded rapidly to reach
728.3m shares, the highest for almost a month. It was pointed out, however,
that 'bed and breakfast', or tax-related deals, accounted for at least 15
per cent of that total. A large number of these trades were said to have
been executed by UBS, the Swiss securities house. There are rumours in the
market that the UK chancellor of the exchequer could include moves to
prohibit such deals in the November 29 budget.
The FT-SE 100 began the session in fine form, with marketmakers hoisting
their opening prices and pushing the 100-index up 12 points. Buying interest
from international institutions began to gather momentum in mid-morning,
when dealers picked up hints of a strong opening by Wall Street, and the
index surged ahead to the day's peak of 3,112.0 shortly before US markets
came in.
Thereafter all eyes were fixed on the dollar and the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, with debt products helping to sustain equities until just before
the close of trading.
Interest in the market's second liners was much more subdued and the FT-SE
Mid 250 Index could manage only a 13.6 rise at 3,533.3.
The demolition of the Democrats in the US saw UK drugs stocks surge ahead,
with analysts taking the view that capping of drugs prices as part of the US
health care reforms proposed by the Clinton administration would be much
harder to implement after the Republicans gained control of the two houses
of Congress.
Cable and Wireless was one of the Footsie's worst performers as the market
showed its disappointment with the poor figures from the company's Mercury
telecoms division.
Bank shares attracted strong support, especially NatWest, where the recent
flow of ADRs, resulting from NatWest's acquisition of Citizens Financial,
and a major drag on the NatWest share price, was said to have dried up.
Utilities suffered from the Labour Party's proposals for the imposition of a
mixture of windfall taxation and a public dividend on the water and
electricity companies.

FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, leading the cash market for most
of the session and racking up the best day's trading volume for some weeks,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
Contract numbers powered ahead to 15,363 from 10,862 on Tuesday, and with
spread trading holding at nominal levels it was nearly all genuine two-way
business.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,115 at the official 4.10pm close, up
44 points. The premium to cash equities was 14 points, with fair value
premium running at around 7 points.
Traders said the improvement in activity was the most striking feature of
the session, with much of the day's buying pressure coming from US houses,
notably Goldman Sachs.
The contract lost some of its impetus in the final hour of trading, and the
premium to cash equities, which had been 20 points for much of the session
and underpinning a reasonable level of arbitrage business, narrowed.
The key to further upwards progress is clearly Wall Street, which showed
signs of flaggging towards the end of the London day. In late, screen
trading the December contract slipped below 3,100.
Traded options activity jumped to 35,998 lots, from 28,478 on Tuesday, with
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business coming to 15,854.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gyrates wildly as
investors reassess poll
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices fluctuated wildly yesterday as markets struggled to gauge
the impact of broad Republican victories in Tuesday's congressional
elections, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up a net 1.01 at 3,831.75.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost just 0.25 at 465.40, while
the American Stock Exchange composite ended 0.2 firmer at 451.25 and the
Nasdaq composite 0.29 easier at 767.25. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 338m shares.
In early trading the Dow surged 38 points on optimism about Republican
control of Congress, but later in the morning the gain was wiped out as
concern about conflict between a Democratic president and Republican
legislature took hold. Program trading and investor profit-taking took the
Dow down a net 20 points at one stage, but prices recovered later in the
day.
In addition to uncertainty about the government, investors were waiting to
see the extent of interest rate increases expected to come out of next
Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting.
Healthcare stocks got a boost from the election news as traders reacted
optimistically to the probable death of broad health reforms proposed by the
Democratic President, Mr Bill Clinton.
Shares of drugmakers were up broadly at the close in spite of some midday
volatility: Merck, a component of the Dow, gained Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
36 7/8 , Pfizer was up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 76 1/8 , Bristol-Myers
Squibb added Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 58 7/8 and Eli Lilly put on Dollars 1
1/4 at Dollars 64 3/8 .
Defence contractors also got an initial boost from the markets as traders
ventured that Republican gains might stem decreases in defence spending.
After strong early rises, General Electric fell to end Dollars  3/8 off on
the day at Dollars 48 3/4 and Raytheon was up a net Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
63 7/8 . Northrop Grumman gained Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 44 1/2 and
Lockheed rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 73 1/2 .
Hospital companies Columbia/HCA Healthcare and National Medical Enterprises
also advanced and retreated with the markets. Columbia was up Dollars  5/8
at Dollars 41 1/4 and NME gained Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 1/2 .
Shares of Long Island Lighting, a New York City-area provider of gas and
electrical services, fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 on the defeat of
the incumbent state governor Mr Mario Cuomo, who had proposed state
acquisition of the utility.
In trading unrelated to the elections, the railroad Santa Fe Pacific rose
sharply by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 after Union Pacific sweetened its
offer to Santa Fe shareholders. Union Pacific shares dropped Dollars 2 to
Dollars 47 1/2 . If the takeover is overturned by regulators, it could be
stuck with Santa Fe shares worth far less than the proposed purchase price.
SciMed Life Systems moved up Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 51 1/4 on news that
the medical device company would be bought by Boston Scientific for Dollars
865m in stock.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the next wave of emerging markets - sometimes described as 'frontier
markets' since they embrace the type of hazards often experienced when
entering a new territory - Russia stands foremost, writes John Pitt.
The recent volatility in the value of the rouble underlined the hazards of
investment at the moment; although to some far-sighted investors the mayhem
in the currency markets was just a passing worry. Indeed, there are some
fund managers who believe that within 20 years the country's capital markets
could equal those of the US.
Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, observing that blue chips lost some
25 per cent of their value during the rouble crisis of mid-October, suggests
that primary market offerings, that is cash auctions, currently present a
better opportunity for investors. The drawback to this method, says Merrill,
is that companies offered in cash auctions provide little or no information,
while the auction itself allows very little time for making decisions, 'a
fact that provides advantage to locals and insiders in a process that is
aimed to attract large foreign investments'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses higher on US election
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses were able to reflect the Republican election victory earlier than
their US counterparts, and doubled or trebled the level of Wall Street's
anticipatory gains overnight, writes Our Markets Staff.
When the Dow put on a percentage point in early trading, said Mr James
Lister-Cheese of Independent Strategy, it looked as if the US were following
Europe, rather than the other way around. However, bourses seemed willing to
follow Wall Street down when it lost some of its enthusiasm.
Independent Strategy said that the Republican victory, and its potential
impact on external trade decisions and the progress of internal budget
reductions in the US, was likely to cause volatility in financial markets.
'On a one-year view, we think that 10-year US Treasury yields will rise to
8.5 per cent from today's level of 8.0 per cent.'
FRANKFURT came back from a session's gain of 43.03 or 2.1 per cent at
2,096.47 to 2,090.78 at the end of Ibis trading. Retailers stayed weak on
worries about consumption trends, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in
Dusseldorf, but otherwise the market rose across the board in the morning;
turnover nearly doubled, from DM4.2bn to DM8bn.
The afternoon saw relative weakness in a number of big blue chips. Siemens
and Volkswagen, up DM4 to DM625.40 and DM5 to DM447.50, were both well off
the top. Analysts said that a Siemens results conference had been
disappointing in content, and VW's global car sales in September dropped by
more than 6 per cent.
In chemicals, BASF rose only DM1.10 to DM317 after talk of a takeover bid
for Boots' pharmaceuticals division, diluting hopes for BASF's gas business;
and Viag, the utility based conglomerate, up just DM1 to DM471, extended its
role as a Dax underperformer in September and October.
ZURICH was cheered by hopes of a stronger dollar, and the SMI index rose
46.5 or 1.8 per cent to 2,590.4 as analysts noted that the weakness of the
US currency had depressed the third-quarter results of the big exporters by
around 8 per cent.
Pharmaceuticals were lifted by expectations that a Republican majority in
Congress would slow President Bill Clinton's health reforms. Roche
certificates picked up SFr155 to SFr5,945 and Ciba registered were SFr21
ahead at SFr749.
Insurers firmed as they sought to play down their exposure to the storm
damage in northwest Italy. Zurich Insurance registered were SFr26 higher at
SFr1,241.
UBS stayed volatile, with the bank said to be buying the bearers and Mr
Martin Ebner's BK Vision picking up the registered stock ahead of the
extraordinary shareholders' meeting on November 22. The bearers rose SFr21
to SFr1,204 and the registered were SFr14 higher at SFr286.
PARIS tailed off during the afternoon session, the CAC-40 index ending with
a gain of 22.32 or 1.2 per cent at 1,943.86, after a high of 1,961.
Turnover improved to FFr4.5bn. Alcatel lost FFr15.60 at FFr432.00 after its
German unit reported that it was to lay off a larger than expected number of
employees during 1994 and 1995. Alcatel-SEL, of Germany, also said that it
saw no return to profitability before 1996.
Lafarge Coppee, the building materials group, outperformed the market with
an advance of FFr15 to FFr406 after reporting an 8.5 per cent increase in
nine-month sales.
AMSTERDAM was driven higher by overall strength on the Continent. The AEX
index added 3.85 at 411.54.
Royal Dutch, expected to announce a modest rise in third-quarter figures
today, with the chemicals side likely to show the best performance, firmed
Fl 1.70 to Fl 191.30.
MILAN was carried along by the upbeat mood elsewhere, although domestic and
budgetary worries were never far from the surface. The Comit index gained
10.74 or 1.7 per cent at 630.89.
Blue chips were broadly higher, with Fiat up L141 at L6,245, Montedison L29
at L1,254 and Telecom Italia L136 at L4,212. Among the banks, Credito
Italiano picked up L32 to L1,628, after the end of bourse trading of its
rights issue on Tuesday, and as its offer for Credito Romagnolo remained in
play. Romagnolo rose L183 to L16,669. BCI appreciated L75 to L3,585.
Insurers were mixed as the industry continued to assess the storm damage in
the northwest of the country. Generali rose L431 to L37,881 but Ina was just
L2 higher at L2,110.
STOCKHOLM hosted better than expected nine-month figures from Electrolux.
The Affarsvarlden index rose 15.2 to 1,461.0, although worries persisted
over the outcome of Sunday's EU referendum.
Electrolux B added SKr9.50 at SKr365, while the drug sub-index advanced 1.9
per cent ahead of reports from Pharmacia today, and Astra tomorrow. Astra
'A' rose SKr5 to SKr192.50 and Pharmacia 'A' climbed SKr2.50 to SKr135.

FT  10 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls further to
a seven-month low
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average finished at a seven-month low after profit-taking
pushed share prices down for the third consecutive day, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was off 185.14 at 19,423.88, its lowest since April 4, after a
day's high of 19,654.33 and low of 19,331.37. Arbitrage buying lifted
equities initially, but active sales in the afternoon by foreign and
individual investors depressed prices.
Profit-taking by institutional investors looking to cover their foreign
exchange losses on overseas bond holdings, due to the recent appreciation of
the yen against the dollar, also weighed on the index. Some shares regained
ground on small-lot bargain hunting towards the end of the session.
Investor confidence was dented, too, by the decline in privatisation issues.
Individual investors and dealers, fearing a further fall in the market, took
profits in early trading. Traders expect the next support point of the
Nikkei 225 to be around the 19,111.92 posted on March 31, the final day of
the last business year.
Volume increased to 299m shares from 210m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 16.99 to 1,533.28, while the Nikkei 300 shed 3.09 to
280.83. Declines led rises by 867 to 124, with 170 issues unchanged. But in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 2.93 at 1,262.23.
Japan Tobacco fell Y16,000 to Y994,000. Investors had been nervous over the
stock dropping below Y1m, regarded as a psychological support level. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone dipped Y29,000 to Y863,000 on active foreign
selling, while East Japan Railways shed Y3,000 to Y475,000.
Banks, which depend on unrealised gains on stockholdings to support their
capital ratios, fell. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y60 to Y2,880.
Large-capital stocks were sold in busy trading. Nippon Steel, the day's most
active issue, lost Y4 at Y384 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y18
to Y752.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 218.81 at 21,465.36 in volume of
44.3m shares.
Roundup
Morgan Stanley Asia added its voice to those reducing the weighting of Hong
Kong equities. It lowered its allocation to a still overweight 35 per cent
from 40 per cent in its Asia-Pacific model portfolio. The move came less
than a week after HG Asia (Singapore) also recommended investors to trim
allocations in Hong Kong. Morgan Stanley upgraded Malaysia, Thailand and
Singapore but cut Australia's weighting to neutral.
HONG KONG finished down but off lows on late futures-led demand after
dipping on news of the Morgan Stanley move. The Hang Seng index lost 10.61
at 9,405.48 after touching 9,356.92. Turnover stayed thin, at a preliminary
HKDollars 2.1bn.
TAIPEI rose sharply on late buying in the electronics and financial sectors,
although brokers said they expected prices to consolidate ahead of local
government elections on December 3. The weighted index put on 101.79 or 1.6
per cent at 6,449.99. Turnover came to TDollars 41.15bn.
SEOUL edged down in volatile trading as selling of financial shares and
mid-priced blue chips alternated with buying of primary blue chips. The
composite index closed 0.36 off at 1,138.39, after backing down from an
all-time intraday high of 1,145.01.
Most preferred stocks were sharply higher after the Securities Supervisory
Board told listed companies and securities houses to buy back 3 per cent of
their own companies' preferred stocks by the first quarter of 1995.
SINGAPORE rebounded as institutional funds returned to buy blue chip banks
and properties. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 17.39 to 2,344.40 as
Salomon Brothers commented that Singapore's residential property market
appeared due for a downward correction but the commercial market was on
track for a cyclical upturn.
BOMBAY's 30-share index ended 90.21 or 2.1 per cent lower at 4,205.68 on
hectic selling by domestic and foreign mutual funds. Brokers noted a lack of
liquidity as mutual funds, committed to investing in the partial
privatisation of seven state-owned companies, held back from making fresh
investments.
KUALA LUMPUR continued to be weighed down by forced selling by investors
unable to meet margin calls. The composite index declined 6.45 to 1,051.51.
SYDNEY was pulled higher by strength in golds. The All Ordinaries index
added 15.3 at 1,982.6 and turnover was ADollars 375.3m. Resources issue CRA
rose 28 cents to ADollars 18.36.
WELLINGTON saw a decline in Carter Holt Harvey pressure prices overall. The
NZSE-40 Capital index fell 10.46 to 2,075.17 in NZDollars 31.8m turnover.
CHH dropped 14 cents to NZDollars 3.86 as a result of worries about its
recently announced purchase of Bowater's Australian operations.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Dollar takes fresh heart from US election
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday rallied on the foreign exchanges as traders took heart
from the good showing by Republicans in the mid-term congressional
elections, writes Philip Gawith.
Analysts were split about the implications of the results for the dollar,
but the market's initial reaction was to assume that the shift in power
towards the Republicans favoured US financial assets and the currency.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.53, two pfennigs up from Tuesday's
close of DM1.5097. Against the yen it closed at Y97.79 from Y97.005. It
ended New York trading at DM1.5275 and Y97.775.
Sterling lost 1 1/2 cents against the stronger dollar, closing at Dollars
1.6036 from Dollars 1.6184. It was higher against the D-Mark at DM2.4534
from DM2.4432.
Opinions diverged about whether, and why, the election results were
important. Some saw them as the catalyst for a big turn in the dollar,
predicated on changes to fiscal policy, and a more aggressive Federal
Reserve, released from the perceived constraints of a Democratic presidency.
Others were more cautious, but said the election was still part of an
important conjuncture of events favouring the dollar. Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank in London, said the combination of last week's
Fed intervention to support the dollar, the election result, and further
monetary tightening made him much more confident about the dollar's
prospects.
Having been bearish on the dollar for the past year, the Citibank analyst
said he had now changed his view: 'The downside for the dollar is likely to
be quite limited; I now believe the dollar goes up from here.'
Mr MacKinnon added: 'The argument is based on the view that what is crucial
for the prospects of the dollar is the relative attractiveness of US
financial assets.' He saw this improving, on the basis of the Fed getting
'ahead of the curve' in the battle against inflation, and this attracting
financial flows back to the US.
Although investor buying would probably only slow the capital outflow from
the US, a long term bearish influence on the dollar, Mr MacKinnon said it
could rise as far as DM1.67 next year. This would be below the DM1.77 high
it touched last February.
Not all observers share this optimism. SG Warburg, for example, forecast the
dollar at DM1.35-45 at the end of 1995.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, was more sceptical
about the importance of the elections. He said the result might justify a
'modest rerating' of dollar assets. 'I would be very sceptical, though,
about calling this a change in trend in terms of the dollar's performance.'
He said the election result had resolved an element of political
uncertainty, but this had not been a significant cause of dollar weakness.
'Monetary policy is a 90 per cent explanatory factor,' added Mr Hannah.
'Unless the market feels comfortable about the Fed's policy stance, and the
election result does not alter that, then we have not really moved on.'
The IBJ analyst said the market price was probably exaggerating the
influence of the elections. Yesterday's move was a technical short squeeze,
rather than a shift in trend. The latter would require aggressive Fed action
 -two 50 basis-point increases in US rates before the end of the year - and
an indication that earlier tightenings were slowing the economy, thus
curbing inflationary pressures.
The French franc fell to FFr3.438/DM, from FFr3.436, its lowest level since
December last year, with the early stages of next year's presidential
campaign beginning to weigh on the currency.
Mr Chis Turner, currency analyst at BZW in London, said: 'It is difficult to
see the franc appreciating ahead of the election, even if the dollar stages
a strong recovery.' The catalyst for recent weakness was the entry into the
campaign of Mr Jacques Chirac. He unnerved markets by saying French
participation in European monetary union should be put to a referendum.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.015bn of late
assistance, and Pounds 143m at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds
1.3bn daily shortage.
Three-month LIBOR was at 6 1/8 per cent. Firmer gilt prices helped short
sterling futures, with the December contract closing at 93.60 from 93.55.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysia turns its back on
commodities - Primary products have little place in the new industrial
vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is enough to make an old planter turn in his grave. Malaysia, for so long
the world's leading producer of natural rubber, is turning its back on the
industry.
'Malaysia is no longer interested in producing rubber,' says Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, the prime minister and main architect of the country's recent high
speed economic growth. 'We hope to relocate the industry to neighbouring
countries like Indonesia.'
Dr Mahathir wants to make Malaysia a fully industrialised country by the
year 2020; and production of primary commodities like rubber and tin has
little place in this vision. Critics say the government's policies are
misguided: in the rush to industrialise a vital part of the economy is being
neglected - expertise and knowledge built up over the years will be wasted.
Over the past 20 years the structure of Malaysia's economy has been
transformed. In the early 1970s rubber and tin made up nearly 70 per cent of
Malaysia's exports. Last year manufactured goods accounted for 74 per cent
of export values, with rubber representing less than 2 per cent and tin only
0.5 per cent.
Until recently Malaysia led the world in the production of natural rubber
and tin. In 1988 it produced 1.8m tonnes of natural rubber but this year
output is likely to fall below 1m tonnes. Both Thailand and Indonesia are
now bigger producers than Malaysia.
The decline has been still more dramatic in Malaysia's tin industry. In the
early 1980s it was producing more than 60,000 tonnes of tin a year. The
industry - the foundation of the fortunes of many the country's early
entrepreneurs - then employed more nearly 40,000 people. This year tin
production will probably be less than 6,000 tonnes and the industry's
workforce has shrunk to about 2,000.
The one bright spot in the commodities sector is palm oil. Encouraged by
generally buoyant world prices, production has doubled over the past 10
years to reach more than 7m tonnes last year. Malaysia now accounts for
about 55 per cent of total world palm oil output.
The fall in world prices for most of Malaysia's primary commodity exports in
recent years has been blamed for the sector's decline. But commodity
producers argue that government policies have accelerated the process. 'The
government is obsessed with manufacturing and ignores the potential - and
the problems - of the commodity sector,' says one rubber producer. 'Yet
commodities are still a central part of the economy.' Last year Malaysia's
commodity exports, including forestry products but excluding oil and gas,
were worth MDollars 25.2bn (Pounds 6bn).
While the share of commodities in overall export earnings is declining the
statistics are misleading.
Commodity producers say their export earnings are of far more direct benefit
to Malaysia's economy than exports from the manufacturing sector.
Multinational electronic companies, operating mostly in free trade zones,
account for a large proportion of Malaysia's manufacturing exports. Those
exports have a high ratio of imported content. A large amount of the funds
from manufactured exports does not flow back into Malaysia but is
repatriated overseas.
Labour shortage problems are particularly acute in the commodities sector.
Local workers have drifted to jobs in factories in the cities and towns:
most of those left behind in the rubber plantations and oil palm estates are
elderly. As a result thousands of immigrants are working in the commodities
sector: on some estates more than 70 per cent of employees are from
Indonesia or Bangladesh.
The plantations object to paying a MDollars 300 government levy, plus
recruiting expenses, for every foreign worker employed. After a few months,
many immigrants go to jobs in the manufacturing sector. Mr Borge
Bek-Nielsen, who runs 94,000 acres of palm oil plantations on Malaysia's
west coast, says action must be taken to keep workers on the land. 'In a way
we are subsidising the industrial sector,' says Mr Bek-Nielsen.
Malaysia has made substantial investments to develop downstream commodity
industries. But producers say that if more attention is not paid to
sustaining commodity output, downstream factories will be starved of raw
materials.
In the first seven months of this year Malaysia's natural rubber imports
increased by 53 per cent compared with the same period last year. In the
first half of 1994 the country's domestic tin in concentrates production
fell below consumption - a position undreamt of just a few years ago.
Malaysia leads the world in many aspects of commodity research and
development. Its rubber, palm oil and cocoa plantations are among the best
run and most productive. Producers say the government should encourage
investors to capitalise on this expertise rather than continually urging
people to put their money into the manufacturing sector.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, the minister of primary industries, told a planters
conference in Kuala Lumpur this month that people should not feel that the
production of primary commodities in Malaysia had reached the end of the
road.
But Dr Mahathir clearly feels this point has been reached in natural rubber
production.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices fall on Brazilian
crop report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee fell in London yesterday when estimates by the Brazilian government
of the extent of damage to next year's crop disappointed traders by being in
line with their expectations. Prices had been bid up in trading earlier this
week following rumours that crop damage was much greater than had previously
been anticipated.
The January futures contract slipped Dollars 62 to Dollars 3,506 a tonne on
the London Commodity Exchange as the New York market also slowed. By midday,
coffee futures at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange had slipped by 2
cents a pound to Dollars 1.87.
The Brazilian government has estimated the 1995-1996 coffee crop at between
12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each) following two frosts and a prolonged
drought. Government officials said the drought was likely to cause the crop
to shrink 25 to 30 per cent on top of damage already wrought by the frosts.
After the frosts, government estimates put the crop at a minimum of 15.7m
bags compared with the 26.5m bags which had been expected before.
Even though the fall in the Brazilian crop will exacerbate tightness in
world supplies by the middle of next year, analysts say the market is well
supplied.
'There is plenty of coffee around right now. Sentiment in the market is
turning bearish and there is a risk the market could drop sharply,' said Ms
Judy Ganes, commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
Brazilian officials said output was not likely to return to normal until
1997.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Untransparent' LME attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The antipathy some metal producers and consumers feel about the London Metal
Exchange was voiced yesterday by Mr Yves Rambaud, chairman of Eramet of
France, the world's fourth-largest nickel producer.
Questioned about the recent sharp rise in the nickel price at a time when
exchange stocks were also increasing, he said the LME was a 'very
untransparent market.' It was not possible, for example, to know who owned
the stocks in LME warehouses.
He said consumers were 'frightened' of the LME and more and more of them
were looking for long-term supply contracts from producers. About 80 per
cent of Eramet's nickel went to stainless steel producers, Mr Rambaud told
the Association of Mining Analysts in London. These customers wanted two
things in particular: continuity of supply and prices not to move outside a
certain range which eliminated the peaks and the troughs in LME prices.
About half of Eramet's sales were made on long-term contracts with these
terms. 'Both we and the consumers agree this is a good system,' he said.
Mr Rambaud suggested that demand in the western world for nickel this year
would grow at between 7 and 9 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in 1993 and
well above the annual average of 2.1 per cent seen in the past 20 years.
This would leave the market in balance because there was no room for western
producers to increase output and no possibility that Russian exports would
grow. Eramet previously forecast a supply surplus of 15,000 tonnes this year
compared with surpluses of 49,000 and 75,000 tonnes in 1993 and 1992.
He pointed out that Russia's production could not increase unless big
investments were made in its industry and then it would take three or four
years for this investment to have an impact. Meanwhile, nickel consumption
in Russia was at such a low level it could not fall much further.
Western producers needed an average price of Dollars 3 to Dollars 3.20 a
pound to break even but a price of Dollars 3.50 to Dollars 4 was required to
make it worth investing to expand existing capacity. Prices of more than
Dollars 5 were needed for new capacity. The LME three-month price closed
last night just below last week's 2 1/4 -year high at Dollars 7,427.50 a
tonne.
Eramet previously announced it would lift annual capacity at its
82-per-cent-owned SLN (Societe Metallurgique Le Nickel) in New Caledonia
from 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes. Mr Rambaud this would be done step by step,
'in line with market growth'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Windwards impatient over delay
to EU banana deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banana exporters from the Windward Islands are becoming increasingly
impatient with internal wrangling at the European Commission that has
delayed a transfer in their supply quotas for the fruit.
Windward Islands' exporters are awaiting a change in their quotas so that
they can ship to the European Union bananas from elsewhere, such as Latin
America, to compensate for the loss of their own crop in tropical storm
Debbie in September.
The commission's banana management committee has already recommended a quota
transfer for the islands, but the proposal has been blocked by German
commissioners because of Bonn's opposition to the whole banana regime.
'We're getting frustrated. We can't defray our fixed costs or keep our
regular customers supplied unless we get a quota increase,' said Mr Bernard
Cornibert, Windward Islands' banana London representative.
St Lucia, for example, is shipping only 3,000 tonnes of bananas a week to
the EU market following the devastation of its crop. At this time in a
normal year, its deliveries would be closer to 6,000 tonnes.
Mr Cornibert says that meeting the same range of fixed costs on smaller
tonnages of fruit has increased costs by 20 to 25 per cent. At the same
time, the islands risk losing customers who they are at present unable to
supply.
He said it would take St Lucia up to 9 months to restore production to its
former levels, but its rehabilitation plans are dependent on aid from the EU
under the Stabex economic programme. St Lucia expects to receive Ecu 3.5m
and Dominique should get Ecu 3.6m, but payment of the grants has also been
delayed.
Bananas from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries enter the EU
tariff-free, but quotas and tariffs are imposed on so-called dollar bananas
from Latin America under the EU's import regime.
The regime is so controversial that the commission is stymied on whatever
action it tries to take by opposition from Germany. An official said the
quota issue could come to a vote next Wednesday.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise on heels of dollar rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and CONNER MIDDELMANN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices rose on the heels of a rally in the dollar yesterday as
traders digested the impact of strong Republican gains in Tuesday's
elections and the afternoon auction of 10-year notes.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at
93 11/32 , yielding 8.088 per cent and the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 3/4
to yield 6.994 per cent.
Prices were volatile, first gaining on the dollar rally then dipping in the
early afternoon in a bout of pre-auction jitters and then reapproaching
their morning highs by late in the day after a strong auction.
Demand at the auction was helped by a strengthening dollar, which rose on
news that Republicans will control both houses of the US legislature.
Late in the afternoon the dollar was up more than two pfennigs against the
D-Mark to DM1.5276 and to Y97.75 against the yen. The recovery helps bonds
because recent weakness in the currency has deterred investors from buying
US securities.
The reaction of the bond markets was somewhat restrained, however, as
investors waited for the increase in interest rates expected to come from
next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. Most
analysts expect a 50 basis point increase in the Federal funds target to 5
1/4 per cent, but some are predicting the Fed might push the target as high
as 5 3/4 .
Traders were also waiting for today's report from the government on the
producer price index. Analysts expect a 0.1 rise in the index for October,
but worry that a much greater increase could provoke an early or large
increase in interest rates by the Fed.
European government bonds were swept up by strength in the US market and
closed near their day's highs. However, they shed some of their gains in
after-hours trading as Treasuries began to come off their highs.
Ahead of next week's FOMC meeting, European markets are expected to continue
closely tracking US developments, with today's release of October producer
prices expected to be keenly watched.
German bunds rose by more than  1/2 point, buoyed by the rally in US
Treasuries and the smooth auction of another large chunk of the government's
latest 10-year bond. The December bund future on DTB rose 0.58 to 89.98.
The Bundesbank sold DM3.99bn of the 7.5 per cent bonds at 99.82 and above.
The weighted average issue price was 99.84, with an average yield of 7.52
per cent.
Market participants today will be watching the meeting of the Bundesbank's
policy-making central bank council, although most dealers said they were not
expecting a change in official interest rates, nor a return to a system of
variable-rate securities repurchase agreements.
UK gilts followed US and European bond markets higher, with the December
gilt futures contract rising by  7/16 to 101 7/16 .
Most of the gains were in the futures market, however, with dealers
reporting very little investor participation. Apart from awaiting the FOMC
meeting, dealers are also looking to next week's raft of UK economic
indicators, including retail prices and jobs data.
French bonds slightly out-performed bunds, causing their yield premium over
the German 10-year benchmark to fall to 69 from 71 basis points.
However, political uncertainty and intra-party bickering in the right-wing
camp ahead of the Presidential elections in May are likely to continue
weighing on bonds in coming months, causing them to under-perform bunds,
said Mr Adrian Owens, European economist at Yamaichi.
'There's only one way that spread will go,' he said, adding he expects the
yield gap to widen to around 90 basis points by year-end.
Italian bonds also rose sharply, buoyed by strength in other markets, the
breach of key technical resistance on the BTP futures contract and recent
calm on the political front. The December BTP future on Liffe rose 0.68 to
101.03.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Lawsuits may force ruling on
interest rate futures - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two large commercial end-users of derivatives, Gibson Greetings Company and
Ohio-based Procter and Gamble, are suing their long-time financial adviser,
saying in separate cases that Bankers Trust failed to disclose fully the
risks and terms of interest rate swaps that turned into significant
loss-makers when US rates turned higher early this year.
This by now is old news. However, the cases have the potential to be
landmarks in the debate over derivatives regulation for at least two
reasons.
First, if the suits are not settled and progress to trial, the world will be
treated to its first intimate glimpse of how the massive private bank market
in swaps really operates.
In spite of numerous authoritative studies of over-the-counter derivatives
markets during the past 18 months, none has actually dissected the mechanics
of an individual trade nor described the confidential courtship and
consumating exchanges that occur between counterparties.
Investment banks, who serve as adviser, designer and counterparty in these
tailored trades, and often also calculate the price base for the cash
streams they generate, may as an industry find themselves uncomfortable with
the detailed disclosure the judicial fact-finding process requires.
Swaps dealers contend that they act in the best interest of their clients,
and value the long-term relationship. However, potential conflicts of
interest can only be highlighted by the discovery process.
Second, both Procter and Gamble and Gibson Greetings have brought their
suits to the federal courts under the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation
provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act, the body of law that governs US
futures and options on futures.
To be successful in this pursuit, the companies will have to prove that the
interest rate swaps in question are futures, and as such, are subject to
oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures
regulator.
Many derivatives players sniff at this strategy, saying it is generally
accepted that OTC swaps are not futures. The CFTC contributed to this
perception in 1992, when it exempted OTC swaps transactions from most of its
oversight authority. In fact, US law has no clear definition of what a
'future' is, and the CFTC avoided the issue when granting its swaps
exemption.
US law does require that anything judged a futures contract be traded on a
listed exchange. Thus, as the swaps industry developed, it hung at the edge
of legitimacy. If a disgruntled counterparty sued, and proved in court that
a swap was a future, the contract could immediately be deemed illegal,
because it was traded off-exchange.
The CFTC's 1992 exemption lifted that judicial jeopardy, effectively saying:
'If a swap is found to be a future, it doesn't have to be exchange-traded to
be legal.' However, that swap would still have to comply with the agency's
anti-fraud rules.
Ms Mary Schapiro, the CFTC's new chairperson, may actually be supporting a
new view that swaps could be futures, by saying she wants to review the
suitability requirements for institutional counterparties that is currently
contained in the exemption. She is also considering creating an office
within her agency that deals solely with OTC derivatives, and reports
directly to her.
Further, she has indicated that she would like to write stand-alone
anti-fraud provisions for swaps, since the existing ones for listed futures
do not transfer sensibly to OTC markets.
Ms Schapiro, who has bi-partisan support in Washington and comes to the CFTC
from a seat on the Securities and Exchange Commission, may in fact be
jockeying to fill in a regulatory void in Washington. The older and larger
SEC only has jurisdiction over swaps that can be proved to have securities
components, while the CFTC can govern swaps only if they can be proved to be
futures, which to date has not happened.
Taking a leadership role and assuming the OTC derivatives turf for her
agency might be a politically astute move for Ms Schapiro, who, unlike her
predecessors, enjoys unusual support from the SEC. In doing so, she is aware
she will have to shed her agency's reputation as a limp regulator.
Industry attorneys point out that the recent spate of derivatives lawsuits
in itself proves an industry contention that additional regulation is not
needed for swaps: that big, sophisticated companies entering into
derivatives contracts have the resources to fight out their disagreements
through the courts, and do not need special government protection.
'I can't think of any federal regulation that could have been written that
would have kept Procter and Gamble from losing what it alleges it lost,'
says one Washington lawyer.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Bonds: EIB follows sterling issue with L400bn
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following its Pounds 200m issue on Tuesday, the European Investment Bank
launched a L400bn bond, led by BNL, BCI and Cariplo and fungible with an
outstanding L500bn.
BNL said the deal met strong demand from institutional and retail investors
in Italy and the Benelux countries.
There were a number of issues at the short end of the dollar sector, again
following recent trends. A Dollars 250m two-year bond, issued by SBC Finance
Cayman Islands, a financing company owned by SBC, and priced at 8 basis
points above the equivalent US Treasury, was well received according to SBC,
which led the issue, with strong demand from Swiss institutional and retail
investors.
Merrill Lynch also saw good demand from European investors for its Dollars
100m floating-rate note issue, paying a coupon of 20 basis points over
three-month Libor. The FRN was the second by Merrill this year.
European, Asian and Latin American investors were attracted by a Dollars 65m
three-year issue by Credibanco, a Brazilian bank, priced at 430 basis points
over the equivalent Treasury and led by Paribas.
The issue was planned before the Brazilian government's recent decision to
increase the tax on eurobond issues from 3 per cent to 7 per cent. Dealers
say the tax increase is unlikely to dissuade new issuers, and point to a
number of banks lining up sizeable deals over the next two to three weeks.
Hemispheric Funding Corporate Series 1994A, a special-purpose funding
vehicle, launched Dollars 300m of floating-rate notes. The issue, led by
Goldman Sachs, is guaranteed by Capital Markets Assurance Corporation, a US
financial guarantee insurance company which enjoys a triple A rating.
Electricite de France made a rare appearance in the euromarkets with a Y30bn
deal with a 4 3/4 per cent coupon via Nomura, which said the deal met strong
demand in Tokyo, with very few bonds placed in Europe.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Share surrogate that is easy
to trade and settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depositary receipts have enjoyed such success because they can make buying
and selling equity in a company easier for international investors than
buying and selling the shares on a local stock exchange, writes Martin
Brice.
The depositary receipt represents ownership of shares which remain in
safe-keeping with a bank in the issuer's home market, often either Bank of
New York or Citibank. The receipt itself may be traded elsewhere. Dividend
payments are usually in US dollars, and voting rights are usually the same
as for the underlying stock.
There is little technical difference between a global depositary receipt
(GDR) and an American depositary receipt (ADR), although depositary receipts
listed in the US tend to be called ADRs while GDRs are often listed
elsewhere - for instance in Luxembourg and increasingly in London.
The first ADR was issued in 1927, but the first GDR came only four years
ago. The forthcoming listing by TeleWest, the UK cable television and
tele-communications company, on the US exchange Nasdaq will be called an
ADR, but may be bought by any international investor; the recent issue by
Bajaj Auto, the Indian scooter maker, was listed in London and called a GDR.
When investors buy and sell GDRs, settlement may be through Cedel, Euroclear
or DTC, the US settlement system.
The documents for issuing a GDR would cost a company around Dollars 100,000,
plus fees to the arranging bank of around 3 1/2 per cent of the total
raised. An ADR offered and listed in the US would cost a company up to
Dollars 1m, of which about half would go on lawyers' fees and much of the
rest on printing and accountants' fees, in addition to the bank's fee.
Where there are barriers to international investors gaining access to the
local stock market, the GDR may fetch a lower or higher price than the
shares in the home market. Citibank, the US bank, pioneered GDRs in 1990
with a Dollars 40m issue for the Korean company Samsung. Much of the
business is now sourced from investment banks in London, with Goldman Sachs
and Jardine Fleming the leaders.
About 90 GDRs are traded via Seaq International and listed on the Luxembourg
stock exchange. Around 275 ADRs are listed in the US.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Four-year surge in ADR and
GDR issues - Emerging markets have put depositary receipts in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The global depositary receipt has been thrust into the spotlight by the
increasing globalisation of equity markets and a steep increase in demand
for capital from companies in the emerging markets of Latin America, Asia
and eastern Europe.
Since its birth with the first humble Dollars 40m issue in 1990, the market
for global depositary receipts (GDRs) has experienced rapid growth. Issues
to date this year exceed Dollars 5.5bn, an increase by a factor of more than
a hundred times since 1990.
The more traditional American depositary receipt (ADR) has also seen a surge
in issuance from companies in emerging markets, following the modification
of US securities laws in 1990.
The passage by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Rule 144a amended
securities legislation governing private placement issues to 'qualified
institutional buyers' - effectively large institutions.
This eliminated the holding period - the period of time for which buyers
must hold shares before trading them - and introduced greater liquidity to
the US market.
Foreign companies can also raise capital through the 144a market without
incurring the expensive regulatory and accounting burdens entailed with the
direct issue of shares.
'The rule 144a market has had a very positive effect on the globalisation of
the US capital market,' said Mr Mark Bach, global sales director of
Citibank, which launched so-called rule 144a depositary receipts in 1990 and
now acts as depositary for 41 per cent of the issuers launching depositary
receipts.
The rate of growth of this instrument has outpaced that of the international
bond markets, where issuance doubled to Dollars 481bn between 1990 and 1993.
During the first nine months of 1994, 184 companies from 40 countries
launched new ADR or GDR programmes, compared with only 96 during the same
period of last year. In the third quarter alone 80 companies launched
programmes, up 135 per cent on last year's figures.
Emerging market issuers now account for 61 per cent of the new depositary
receipts, compared with 11 per cent of new programmes issued in 1990.
'The emerging markets are by far the fastest growing segment of the
depositary receipt business today,' notes Mr Bach.
Aside from the rapid growth in global equity issues in general and the
growing popularity of foreign issues for US investors, two other other
factors help explain the popularity of the depositary receipt mechanism for
companies in emerging markets seeking to raise capital from institutions in
the United States, Europe and Asia.
Depositary receipt programmes allow investors to circumvent problems caused
by poor or unwieldy settlement systems.
That has been a particularly attractive factor in India, where the Bombay
Stock Exchange has a 45-day settlement period.
It could also play an important part in expanding the DR market as companies
in Russia, where settlement systems are primitive, seek to raise capital on
world markets.
International investors have little confidence in the ability of domestic
institutions to safeguard securities, which makes trade in the depositary
receipt proxy an attractive alternative.
Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank, is planning a multi-billion GDR
issue for Gazprom, the country's giant gas company, which aims to sell a 9
per cent stake to international investors next year.
Last week, international trading in shares held by a Cyprus-based holding
company of RNGS, the giant Russian oil and gas construction company, began.
The shares are held by the holding company, which in turn holds the RNGS
shares, along the lines of a depositary receipt issue.
The use of a depositary receipt allows international investors access to
equity markets which would otherwise be out of reach.
Jardine Fleming, the UK-based investment bank, has constructed a Dollars
250m issue for Benpres, the largest broadcasting group in the Philippines,
to allow foreigners to own receipts but not the underlying shares. Local
legislation places restrictions on the foreign ownership of the shares of
media companies.
Among big issuers of depositary receipts this year are Korean companies,
which have raised Dollars 473.9m so far in 1994, bringing total issuance by
companies from the country to Dollars 1.19bn since 1990.
Last month Korea Electric Power, Korea's biggest company by capitalisation,
became the country's second company to list on the New York Stock Exchange,
when it raised Dollars 300m in a global equity offering of 14.9m ADRs.
October also saw one of Asia's biggest ever international equity offerings
through DRs, when Indosat, Indonesia's international telecommunications
company, raised more than Dollars 720m through an issue of 22.5m ADRs.
Citibank also singles out Hong Kong (17 issues), Brazil (16 issues) and
Mexico (16 issues) and South Africa (10 issues) as highly active issuers of
depositary receipts in the first nine months of this year.
However, growth has been particularly rapid in India, where more than 29
companies have issued depositary receipt programmes in the first nine months
of the year. Indian companies have raised more than Dollars 2.2bn in DR
issues alone so far this year compared with less than Dollars 900m last
year. And since the first Indian DR was issued in 1992, 50 Indian companies
have received almost Dollars 4bn of the Dollars 11bn raised from DR issues.
Mr Ian Hannam, a director of Jardine Fleming, believes India has many
attractions over other emerging markets. 'The real attractions are the
existence of a middle class the size of the entire USA, and a recognised
legal and accounting framework for the ownership of assets.'
The absence of a legal framework for the ownership of assets is a problem
for the emerging economies of eastern Europe, but not for India, he said.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the prospective sale of Videsh Sanchar
Nigam (VSNL), the state-controlled international telecommunications
monopoly, prospects are still regarded as good, with overall DR issuance
alone in India expected to climb to Dollars 2.5bn by the end of the year.
Indeed, the Indian DR market could be about to enter a new phase following
the change in rules governing the issuance of DRs. The government has ended
the use of warrants, which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed
price in the future.
Warrants were often used to make an offer more attractive, since they could
be priced more cheaply than existing shares.
The end of warrants is likely to mean a two-tier market emerging for Indian
GDRs, believe some investment bankers.
Whereas blue-chip companies such as Bajaj Auto, whose issue was priced at a
premium to the underlying share, are likely to find an enthusiastic welcome,
second-line companies are likely to struggle, bankers believe.
However, with more than 20 permissions given by the Indian government for
fundraising issues of Dollars 100m currently outstanding, the GDR has an
active future.
At least one London merchant bank is believed to be looking at using GDRs to
finance telecom projects in India, which is likely to remain the biggest
market for GDRs.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to assist Poland with
new futures exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Chicago Board of Trade will today sign an agreement with Polish
officials to help establish a new futures exchange in Warsaw. The Chicago
exchange has promised to contribute its expertise in market development in
return for unspecified fees and 15 per cent ownership of the new exchange.
Although US futures exchanges have informally assisted emerging markets for
years, this is the first time one has commanded an ownership stake in a new
venture.
The CBoT's agreement is with a foundation led by the Polish government
agency for agricultural markets and Rolimpex, a Polish agri-business
concern.
Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT's chairman, said the agreement was the first of a
series of innovative international business arrangements his exchange
expects to make.
The membership equity gained from the Warsaw exchange 'will provide
additional trading opportunities for our members and member firms,' Mr Arbor
said.
Polish officials see the creation of a commodities exchange as an important
step in the transition to a free market economy. They expect wheat to be the
first commodity traded there.
However, futures trading may be a long way off for the country, which first
needs to develop a free primary market for grain, and a legal framework for
a futures market.
Mr Fred Grede, the CBoT's senior vice-president in charge of operations and
planning, acknowledges the difficulties that face the venture. 'One of the
key questions is how to create a properly functioning cash market,' he said.
He added that his exchange plans to use the expertise of its membership to
help develop the underlying systems needed to support futures trading.
Goldman Sachs initiated the talks between the CBoT and Poland, and intends
to continue to serve as an adviser and consultant on the project.

joint venture

<TEXT>
Seagray Fosh Futures, an independent UK futures and options broker, is to
set up a 50-50 joint venture with with Chemical Futures &amp; Options (UK), a
subsidiary of Chemical Bank of the US.
The new company, SGF Chemical Futures and Options, will deal in both futures
and options on Liffe, taking advantage of Seagray's position as a leader in
the exchange traded options market in London.
It will make also use CF&amp;O's existing expertise in clearing and settlement,
providing a 'one-stop service' for both execution and clearing of trades.
The new venture is keen to increase its presence in the futures market and
also hopes to be better placed to meet increased demand from hedge funds,
many of which want a combined execution and clearing service, said Mr
Matthew Fosh, a director and co-founder of Seagray.
Unlike bank traders, hedge funds generally buy clearing services from third
parties, explained Mr Fosh.
Seagray, which employs a team of 25, was set up by Mr Fosh and Mr James
Campbell-Gray, an independent trader on Liffe since its inauguration.
Mr Fosh previously worked at stockbrokers Strauss Turnbull and then
Sheppards.
CF&amp;O was set up in April 1990 to complement Chemical Futures &amp; Options Inc's
Chicago and Philadelphia operations and help capture the global growth in
exchange-traded derivatives.

Casinos Austria, the European casino operator, has announced plans to raise
ADollars 64.5m through a listing on the Australian Stock Exchange.
The company will offer a 45 per cent interest in a company called Casinos
Austria International (CAI) as part of a plan for further expansion in the
Asian region.
CAI will control the equity investments, management contracts and
development rights of Casinos Austria's operations outside Europe. These
include the operation or management of three Australian casinos, in Canberra
and Cairns, and on Christmas Island.
Casino's Austria, which will retain a 55 per cent interest in the Australian
group, operates 55 land and 21 shipboard casinos, with a further nine
contracted for operation.
The parent company's president, Dr Leo Wallner, said yesterday the group
would use Australia as a 'launching pad' for expansion in the Pacific Rim.
The Australian company also holds options to participate in several of the
parent's expanding casino operations, including projects in the US and
Canada and on cruise ships operating from Greece.
CAI is projecting an increase in revenue to ADollars 71.5m (USDollars 53.8m)
for 1995 from ADollars 61.4m this year. A ADollars 10.9m pre-tax profit has
been forecast for 1995.

262m a year ago, on a 7.6 per cent increase in operating revenue to ADollars
2.99bn from ADollars 2.78bn.
A 43 per cent rise in earnings from associated companies and a lower net
interest bill also helped earnings. However, Australian and UK newspaper
interests were flat.
Most of its earnings came from the US, where operating income rose to
ADollars 283m from ADollars 248m. Directors said profits from Twentieth
Century Fox films had doubled in the quarter following successful releases
such as Speed and True Lies. Results from the Fox television station group
were also up strongly.
Magazine and inserts results, where operating income rose to ADollars 74m
from ADollars 70m ,benefited from higher pricing and advertising revenues.
But earnings from the HarperCollins book publishing operation eased to
ADollars 65m from ADollars 76m, reflecting weaker results from the San
Francisco group.
Operating income from UK operations fell to ADollars 65m from ADollars 75m,
with directors citing the impact of The Times newspaper's price cut in June.
'Circulation at The Times now stands at 607,143, an increase of more than 37
per cent versus a year ago,' they said.
'At The Sun, circulation remains in excess of 4m copies following a 2p
cover-price rise on August 22. On the advertising front, revenues are up
across all titles, due to an improving advertising market and higher
circulation levels.'
Directors said BSkyB, the company's 50 per cent owned satellite broadcasting
subsidiary (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake),
achieved a significant increase in operating profit, with total subscribers
exceeding 3.6m.
The company's Australia and Pacific Basin region saw the biggest segmental
earnings fall, with operating income down to ADollars 40m from ADollars 89m.
Directors said revenue gains had been offset by higher depreciation charges
due to plant modernisation.
Star TV, the 64 per cent owned satellite broadcasting subsidiary, incurred a
loss.
Ansett, the 50 per cent owned Australian airline, continued to increase
earnings, and with BSkyB, lifted the contribution from associated companies
to ADollars 106m from ADollars 74m.
News Corp's direct operating income fell by 5.8 per cent to ADollars 388m
from ADollars 412m, mainly reflecting last year's sale of the South China
Morning Post and unfavourable exchange rates. However, currency changes also
contributed to a fall in interest expense to ADollars 154m from ADollars
173m.
Tax provisions took ADollars 47m compared with ADollars 39m. This excludes a
ADollars 3m abnormal profit, compared with a ADollars 16m loss previously.
US operations contributed the biggest share of group revenues, up to
ADollars 2.2bn from ADollars 1.93bn. UK revenues eased to ADollars 469m from
ADollars 471m and Australian revenues were down to ADollars 375m from
ADollars 382m.

from Rp14.82bn a year earlier, on a 16 per cent rise in revenue, AP-DJ

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese drugs groups withstand
price cuts - Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cost-cutting and strong sales of high-margin drugs offset the effects of
weak overall sales growth to support earnings at leading Japanese
pharmaceuticals companies for the first six months to September.
Although average drug prices were marked down by 6.6 per cent across the
industry in April, after the ministry of health and welfare cut prescription
drug prices, there was a sharp rise in sales the same month as customers,
who had held back orders, rushed to take advantage of lower prices.
Profits were further supported by a sharp rise in sales of vitamin drinks,
helped by an unusually hot summer.
Takeda Chemical said healthy sales of vitamin tablets boosted profits.
Profitability at its pharmaceutical division, where sales rose 0.8 per cent,
weakened due to drug price cuts and growing research and development costs.
However, the healthcare products division benefited from strong sales of
vitamin drinks to show a sales rise of 8.8 per cent. For the full year to
next March, the company expects recurring profits to fall 0.2 per cent to
Y77bn (Dollars 793.8m) on a 1.5 per cent rise in sales to Y570bn.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical saw strong sales of its stomach ulcer remedy
Gastar, although sales of its interferon drug suffered from price cuts. The
company will raise its interim dividend payment to Y8 per share from last
interim's Y6.5. For the full year, it expects sales to rise 2 per cent to
Y265bn on a 0.2 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y54.5bn.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical saw firm drug sales, while profits were supported by
a cut in research and development costs. After-tax profit rose sharply due
to decreased appraisal losses on shares of its subsidiary, and smaller
corporate tax payments. Annual sales are expected to fall 1.2 per cent to
Y232bn, while current profits are expected to rise 10.3 per cent to Y22bn.
Shionogi said a fall in drug sales and interest revenue hurt profitability.
The company suffered an average cut in drug prices of 4.8 per cent, while
sales of its mainstay anti-biotics were weak. For the full year to March,
Shionogi expects a 1.4 per cent drop in sales, to Y227bn, on an 11 per cent
fall in recurring profits to Y20.5bn.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical attributed an earnings rise to strong sales of its
anti-bacterial agents. Cost cutting also helped. The company expects
full-year sales to rise 1.2 per cent to Y210bn and current profits to
increase 0.5 per cent to Y38.5bn.
Sankyo, which will report its earnings today, is expected to see solid
profits growth, attributable to strong sales of its anti-cholesterol drug.
However, revenues are expected to have suffered because of decreased sales
of drugs made by Sandoz, the Swiss drug company.

<TEXT>
South African Breweries, the country's largest industrial company, recorded
a 21 per cent rise in attributable profit, to R342m (Dollars 97.8m) for the
six months to September, compared with R283m for the same period a year ago.
The figure was broadly in line with market expectations.
An improvement in South African consumer confidence helped all divisions,
which produced an overall 14 per cent rise in turnover to R12.9bn, up from
R11.4bn previously. Improved margins meant that trading profit rose 19 per
cent to R1.15bn from R971m.
Tax paid rose to R949m from R765m, while net financing costs dropped
slightly to R241m from R249m a year ago. The interim dividend was lifted 21
per cent to 47 cents from 39 cents. Meanwhile, cash flow rose sharply to
R1bn, well up on last year's R272m. The group attributed this to of its
tight management of working capital.
The beer division, which contributes most of the bottom line, achieved
earnings growth of 21 per cent. Meanwhile, the group's other interests,
including Lion Match, Plate Glass Shatterprufe Industries and Afcol, showed
a combined 20 per cent rise in earnings.
SAB has has reached conditional agreement with China Resources Enterprise,
the Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of the PRC state-owned China Resources
Holding, to form a joint venture that will hold CRE's existing 55 per cent
controlling interest in the Shenyang Brewery, China's second largest
brewery.
SAB will pay Dollars 25m through its subsidiary Westgate Worldwide, which
holds the group's international beverage activities, to participate in the
joint venture.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metall Mining to shut down
smelter for three years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metall Mining, the inter-national copper producer until recently controlled
by Germany's Metallgesellschaft, plans to close its Copper Range smelter in
Michigan next spring for about three years.
The Toronto-based company yesterday put a brave face on the shutdown and
various changes in mining practices at Copper Range which have dented
productivity. The changes coincide with proposed modifications to the
smelter required by tighter environmental standards.
Mr Klaus Zeitler, Metall chief executive, said that the mining changes would
have a detrimental effect on earnings for the rest of this year, 'but in the
long-term it will have a highly beneficial effect'.
Metall's share price dipped by 75 cents to close at CDollars 12 on the
Toronto stock exchange.
The Copper Range news overshadowed an overall improvement in third-quarter
performance, caused by rising metal prices and higher investment income.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 6.1m (USDollars 4.49m) or 7 cents a
share, compared with a CDollars 5.9m loss, equal to 9 cents a share, a year
earlier.
Revenues climbed to CDollars 208.5m from CDollars 44.5m, largely as a result
of last year's acquisition from Metallgesellschaft of a 35 per cent stake in
Norddeutsche Affinerie, the European copper smelter.
Copper Range's cathode output fell to 22.6m lbs from 24.8m lbs, due to lower
grades and productivity. Metall said that copper grades slid by more than 10
per cent during the quarter as a result of difficult mining conditions, and
a decision to stop second-pass mining. Cash operating costs averaged
USDollars 1.05 a lb, up from 78 cents in 1993.
The suspension of second-pass, or pillar, mining, is designed to ensure
stable rock conditions for solution mining, which is expected to be
introduced in tandem with the smelter modifications.
Metall has reached an agreement with Canada's Hudson Bay Mining to process
Copper Range concentrates for 33 months, starting next March.
Dr Zeitler said that Metall was keen to acquire another large copper mining
project. Its interest was focused on South America. It suffered a setback
recently with a failed bid for the Tintaya copper project in Peru. But Teck
Corporation, in which Metall is a minority shareholder, unveiled plans
yesterday for a final feasibility study of the large Petaquilla deposit in
Panama.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific in surprise new
offer for Santa Fe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The takeover battle for Santa Fe Pacific, one of the biggest US railway
companies, yesterday took a new turn after Union Pacific, the hostile
bidder, produced a surprise tactic in an attempt to outmanoeuvre Burlington
Northern, the friendly suitor.
Union Pacific put forward a new offer worth Dollars 3.3bn in cash and
shares, substantially less than its last offer of Dollars 3.8bn.
However, it said shareholders would get the cash and shares immediately
instead of having to wait a year or more while the Federal regulatory
authorities considered the deal.
The proposal could prove tempting to Santa Fe's shareholders because
Burlington Northern's all-share offer is worth less - Dollars 3.2bn - and
would have to await regulatory approval.
Santa Fe, which had rejected Union Pacific's two previous offers, yesterday
said it was studying the latest proposal.
The bids will be put to a shareholder vote on November 18.
Until now, Union Pacific's bid for Santa Fe, although worth more than
Burlington Northern's, had looked less likely to succeed because it ran the
risk of being ruled out on anti-trust grounds by the regulatory authorities.
Large parts of the Union Pacific and Santa Fe rail networks overlap.
Under the new proposal, announced late on Tuesday, Union Pacific is offering
Dollars 17.50 for each Santa Fe share, Dollars 10 in cash and the remainder
in Union Pacific stock.
If Santa Fe shareholders accept, Union Pacific will set up an independent
voting trust to hold Santa Fe's stock while the regulatory authorities
consider the deal.
Santa Fe shares shot up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 16 1/8 yesterday, a rise of
over 9 per cent. Union Pacific shares dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 47 1/2 ,
while Burlington Northern were unchanged at Dollars 49 3/8.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Improved sales lift Federated to
Dollars 44.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Increased sales and improved efficiency helped Federated Department Stores,
the US owner of Bloomingdale's and other department store chains, to produce
a surge in net income from Dollars 20.3m to Dollars 44.3m in its third
quarter to Octo-ber.
The increase in earnings was exaggerated by a tax adjustment in the
comparable period, but Federated said net income would still have been 26
per cent ahead if the adjustment had not taken place.
Earnings a share rose to 35 cents in the quarter from 16 cents.
Some of the profits increase came from an 8 per cent rise in revenues to
Dollars 1.93bn.
Federated opened four new stores during the period, taking the total to 235,
while sales at existing stores rose by 3.4 per cent.
Gross margins fell to 38.5 per cent from 39.5 per cent because Federated
marked down prices to shift goods. However, the effects were outweighed by
its continuing efforts to increase efficiency: operating costs were down
from 33.8 per cent of sales to 31.7 per cent.
In July Federated won agreement from R. H. Macy, the rival department store
group, to a merger but the deal is not expected to be completed until the
end of the year and is not reflected in the figures.
Nordstrom, a US clothing retailer with 55 large stores, reported a 50 per
cent increase in net income from Dollars 25.5m to Dollars 38.1m in the
quarter to October, continuing the strong profits growth seen earlier in the
year.
Earnings a share increased from 31 cents to 46 cents.
The company said higher sales revenues, fewer markdowns and greater control
over costs were behind the increase.
Revenues rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 862m, with existing stores
increasing sales by 6.7 per cent and the rest coming from new stores.

<TEXT>
Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa) is considering buying a minority stake in a
Russian aluminium smelting plant in Siberia in what would be its first
investment in the former Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Michigan.
While the initial investment would be small, it could grow to as much as
Dollars 500m over the next 10 years, said Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman and
chief executive officer.
Mr O'Neill said he planned to visit the plant in Krasnoyarsk after the
Thanksgiving holiday and would make a final decision within a couple of
months.
He added that the smelter had the capacity to produce 750,000 tonnes of
aluminium per year. However, the plant had numerous environmental problems
and would need to be upgraded to become more efficient.
He said his visit would provide first-hand evidence of the investments
needed to modernise the plant. 'I'm convinced it is a sufficiently real and
interesting possibility that I need to go look at it myself.'
A deadline for any possible deal is 'close enough that we're going to have
to make a decision to put some real shareholder money at risk'.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: A Dollars 1.7bn marriage that
faces a bumpy ride - Investors have doubts over Quaker Oats' purchase of
Snapple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They make an odd couple. On the one hand is Quaker Oats, a 103-year-old US
cereal manufacturer whose name is synonymous with porridge. On the other is
Snapple Beverage, a trendy soft drinks company that has shot to prominence
in the US through the phenomenal success of its 'new age' iced tea and juice
drinks. Will the marriage work?
Last week Quaker Oats announced it was paying Dollars 1.7bn in cash to buy
Snapple. The acquisition, it said, would turn Quaker Oats into the biggest
soft drinks company in the US after Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, and accelerate
future profits growth.
But if it had hoped for a favourable reaction from the stock market, it was
to be disappointed: its shares tumbled Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 on
the day, a fall of nearly 10 per cent.
The Snapple acquisition may be the biggest in Quaker's history, but it is
not the first. Since the 1960s, the company has diversified into other
business areas, including fast-food restaurants, specialty retailing and toy
manufacturing, only to get out again. But in 1983 it struck lucky when it
bought Stokely-Van Camp, a US food company that made Gatorade, a sports
drink.
Thanks to a combination of changing tastes among increasingly
health-conscious US consumers and heavy investment in the brand by Quaker
Oats, sales of Gatorade shot up. In 1983 they were barely Dollars 90m; in
the current financial year, they are expected to be Dollars 1.2bn.
But Gatorade's meteoric performance has not been matched by that of the
group's other products, mainly cereals and pet foods. Here, Quaker Oats has
been doing little better than holding its own in the face of tough
competition from bigger rivals, and overall profits growth has been flaccid.
The business logic for the Snapple acquisition looks straightforward enough.
With Gatorade, Quaker Oats is already the US market leader in sports drinks.
With Snapple's trendy Mango Iced Tea, Amazin' Grape Juice and the like,
Quaker Oats will also become market leader in ready-to-drink iced teas and
juice drinks. So Quaker Oats becomes market leader in the three
fastest-growing beverage segments in the US.
Further, Quaker Oats believes it can gain by feeding Snapple through
Gatorade's distribution channels. Snapple sells mainly through corner stores
and delicatessens, and has barely 1 per cent of its sales outside the US.
Gatorade, in contrast, sells through convenience stores and supermarkets,
and sells in more than 25 countries.
Quaker Oats also announced it would offset part of the cost of buying
Snapple by selling its European pet food and Mexican chocolate businesses.
(Analysts think they may fetch around Dollars 700m.) Mr William Smithburg,
chairman and chief executive of Quaker Oats, said this was in keeping with
the company's policy of improving the profitability of lower-return
businesses, or divesting them.
'Our goal is to deliver above-average returns over time with a high-growth,
high-margin portfolio of leading consumer brands that fuel health-conscious
consumers around the world,' Mr Smithburg said.
So why the fall in the share price?
Partly, it was because Quaker Oats will look a good deal less vulnerable to
a takeover bid than before - but for the worst of reasons.
Perhaps the biggest is the fact that news of the deal coincided with the
publication of Snapple's latest financial results showing that net profits
had slumped from Dollars 26.9m to Dollars 7.1m in the quarter to September.
Quaker Oats tried to play down concern over the figures. Snapple's annual
sales had grown from Dollars 40m to Dollars 600m in four years, it said, and
it was not unusual for a company growing that quickly to hit a few bumps
along the road. In this case, inventory build-ups had slowed factory
shipments, merchandising costs were up, and competition caused iced tea
sales to be lower than expected.
Yet Snapple's potential difficulties cannot be ignored. One danger is that
'good-for-you' beverages could be just a fad; but much the larger threat is
that the mighty Coca-Cola and PepsiCo - acutely aware of the fact that their
colas are losing market share to alternative drinks - will plunder the
market for 'new age' beverages and squeeze Snapple till the pips squeak.
The warning signs are already there. PepsiCo, in a joint venture with
Unilever's Thomas J. Lipton tea company, has launched Lipton iced tea, and
Coca-Cola, in a joint venture with Nestle of Switzerland, has launched
Nestea.
In March this year Coca-Cola introduced its own range of 'new age' fruit
drinks, such as Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and Grape Beyond, and PepsiCo has
launched a range of lemonade drinks called Ocean Spray.
Meanwhile, Gatorade is also under siege. Coca-Cola is attacking its market
with a sports drink called Powerade and PepsiCo with All Sport. Ominously,
Quaker Oats suffered a slump in net profits to Dollars 61.4m from Dollars
91.4m in the quarter to September, partly because it had to spend more on
marketing to defend Gatorade from competition.
Quaker Oats has acknowledged that the Snapple acquisition would dilute
earnings per share by 45 cents to 55 cents in the year to June 1996. It has
also said the deal would not begin to benefit the bottom line until the year
to June 1998. If the share price is down, it is because some investors
wonder whether even that could turn out to be too rosy a prognosis.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Alcatel-SEL to cut 5,300 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Alcatel-SEL, the German subsidiary of Alcatel Alsthom, the French
telecommunications, transport and engineering group, yesterday announced
restructuring measures in an attempt to stem losses which have shaken its
parent company.
The announcement coincided with another blow to Alcatel Alsthom. Mr
Jean-Claude Leny, chairman of Framatome, revealed the French government had
decided against the planned privatisation of the nuclear power-plant group.
Alcatel Alsthom had lobbied hard to take control of the company, in which it
has a 44 per cent stake.
Alcatel-SEL plans to cut 5,300 jobs, almost one quarter of the workforce, by
the end of 1995. Plants at Mannheim and Rochlitz are to close.
The moves are aimed at curbing losses expected to total about DM300m
(Dollars 199m) this year at the operating level. 'We are losing about DM1m a
day,' said Mr Gerhard Zeidler, chairman of Alcatel-SEL.
The company says provisions of DM200m to DM300m will be required to cover
losses in 1994. A return to profit is not expected until 1996.
The losses reflect difficulties faced by suppliers of telecommunications
equipment in the German market. Orders from large clients such as Deutsche
Telekom, the national telecoms operator, have fallen, while prices have been
hit by increased competition.
The deterioration in the market reflects structural problems, according to
industry analysts. Telecoms investment in eastern Germany has slowed, while
the shift by Deutsche Telekom to increase competition in the award of
contracts has undermined traditional suppliers, such as Alcatel and Siemens.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk falls 6% despite
sales growth
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and industrial
enzymes producer, fell by 6 per cent to DKr1.24bn (Dollars 211m) from
DKr1.32bn in the first nine months of the year. The group's net profits fell
7 per cent to DKr 934m from DKr1bn.
Earnings per share were reduced to DKr24.50 from DKr26.66 last year. But the
group forecast that pre-tax earnings for the full year will be
DKr1.92bn-DKr1.97bn, compared with DKr1.86bn last year.
A 12 per cent increase in sales so far this year was eclipsed by a faster
growth in costs, which reflected expansion in production capacity, the group
said.
Sales were up to DKr9.94bn from DKr8.84bn, including a rise of 13 per cent
by the insulin-producing healthcare division to DKr6.69bn and by 11 per cent
to DKr2.64bn in the industrial enzymes.
Costs rose 16 per cent to DKr9.09bn, including tax and net financial items,
with the latter increasing DKr31m to DKr135m.
Novo said the rise in costs was caused primarily by the expansion of its
international production and sales facilities, with five new factories
either starting up shortly or not yet contributing significantly to sales.
The group said it had problems meeting demand for some types of insulin,
used for diabetic care, in the US as a result of a temporary closure of a
Danish plant.
In addition, there had been delays in bringing a new plant in the US on
stream due to US Food and Drug Administration requirements.
Novo Nordisk said the Danish plant was producing again and the problems at
the US plant, which is subject of a routine inspection by the FDA, have been
solved.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the Austrian building materials group,
reported a 5.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in the third quarter to
Sch386m (Dollars 36.4m). This was mainly due to the strong performance of
its core bricks and pipes businesses.
For the nine months, pre-tax profits were ahead 30.7 per cent to Sch1.02bn
and the directors have raised their profit forecast for the full year to
Sch1.15bn, 22.6 per cent above the 1993 result.
Sales in the nine months fell 20.6 per cent to Sch7.4bn, mainly because of
the sale of the sanitary fitting subsidiary to Wolseley of the UK earlier
this year. Excluding this distortion, sales were ahead about 10 per cent,
the group said.
The loss at the troubled Treibacher ferro-alloy subsidiary was slashed in
the third quarter to Sch7.8m from Sch68.1m, in the same period of last year,
mainly as a result of cost reductions. There was a small improvement in
market conditions.
Pre-tax profits of the wall, ceiling and roof division advanced 5.4 per cent
to Sch282.5m in the third quarter, while those of the pipe systems and
sewage technology division jumped 56 per cent to Sch62.6m.
Lenzing, the world's largest producer of viscose fibres, said sales were
flat in the first nine months of the year at Sch6.04bn, excluding the 1993
sales figures of Glanzstoff, sold earlier this year.
The group, which suffered a loss of Sch203m in 1993, said it expected a
positive result for the full year 1994.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Electrolux posts seven-fold
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A seven-fold rise in profits at Electrolux in the first nine months was
powered by cost-cutting, big capital gains, and economic recovery in western
Europe.
The world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances saw income after
financial items jump to SKr5.08bn (Dollars 698m) from SKr712m.
The sale of three non-core industrial units produced capital gains of
SKr2.77bn and lifted operating income to SKr6.26bn from SKr2.01bn.
Without the gain, operating income was 73 per cent higher at SKr3.48bn while
income after financial items was up 224 per cent at SKr2.31bn. Earnings per
share climbed to SKr19.8 from SKr2. Electrolux B shares closed SKr9.5 higher
at SKr365.5.
Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive, said the underlying improvement was
mainly due to the group's restructuring and cost-cutting programme which has
lifted productivity by 10 per cent over the past year.
However, he said market conditions in Europe and the US were better,
reflected in an 8 per cent underlying increase in sales to SKr79.8bn.
The recovery has been driven by household appliances, the biggest of the
group's four divisions.
The group said there were signs that the pace of increase in demand in North
America was slowing, while momentum was increasing in most European markets.
'We are also starting to see some price increases in the European household
appliance market,' he said, although he noted that the group's own raw
material costs were also rising.
Sales of household appliances rose 9.2 per cent to SKr47.6bn. Operating
income showed 'a marked improvement' driven by a strong performance from the
group's US and European white goods units.
The group's three other divisions, commercial appliances, outdoor products
and industrial products, improved operating income.
In the third quarter, group income after financial items climbed to SKr650m
from SKr107m after an 8 per cent rise in underlying sales to SKr24.2bn.
There was a stronger performance from the group's commercial appliances
division, which suffered from weak demand in the first six months.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: SAS profits recovery continues
in third period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery at Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) continued in the third
quarter, enabling the group to report pre-tax profits of SKr1.24bn (Dollars
170m) for the first nine months after a SKr1.13bn loss in the same 1993
period.
The group, half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway,
benefited from cost-cutting, a lower debt burden and a positive trend in its
core airline business. Disposal of non-core operations yielded SKr829m in
capital gains.
The airline was hit by SKr750m in restructuring costs and a higher aircraft
depreciation charge after a change of accounting methods.
Operating income fell slightly to SKr28.3bn from SKr29.2bn, but costs fell
further to leave the group with an operating profit before depreciation of
SKr2.56bn, compared with SKr1.82bn.
The figures benefited from a 7 per cent currency-adjusted rise in traffic
revenues and higher yields. The traffic increase was felt mainly on the
company's European and intra-Scandinavian routes.
The group's cost-cutting programme, involving the loss of 3,000 jobs, is
also beginning to have an impact.
The third factor in the airline's revival has been sharply reduced interest
costs after cutting its net debt to SKr6.98bn from SKr13.89bn since the
start of the year.
The balance sheet has been strengthened by the disposal of SAS Leisure, a
tour operator, SAS Service Partner, a catering unit, and Diners Club Nordic.
These generated more than SKr3bn in cash flow.
The third quarter brought a SKr624m pre-tax profit after last year's SKr520m
loss.
It was the airline's second consecutive quarter in the black and keeps it on
course for its first full-year profit since 1989. During the past four
years, it has made losses due to recession, fierce competition, heavy
restructuring costs and currency losses.

FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Siemens drops 17% after charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens, Germany's leading electrical and electronics group, is to pay an
unchanged DM13 dividend in spite of an unexpectedly sharp profits setback in
the year to the end of September.
Net earnings before extraordinary items dropped 17 per cent to DM1.65bn
(Dollars 1.1bn) because of higher restructuring charges, increased price
competition in important sectors and relatively weak investment income, the
group said yesterday.
However, the DM344m proceeds of the sale of a heart pacemaker subsidiary
raised total net profits 1 per cent to DM1.99bn. Executives had warned of a
maximum decline of up to 15 per cent.
Although yesterday's preliminary figures gave no earnings breakdown, recent
statements have suggested that core divisions - including public
telecommunications and the KWU power generation subsidiary - have been
squeezed especially hard by international price competition and the end of a
period of high demand after German reunification.
Group sales, up 10 per cent abroad and down 4 per cent at home, rose an
aggregate 4 per cent to DM84.6bn. Incoming orders increased 5 per cent due
solely to a 15 per cent increase in foreign demand, which accounted for 60
per cent of the total bookings. Domestic orders, which were 6 per cent lower
after six months, fell 7 per cent over the full year. Foreign demand, up 21
per cent at halfway, appeared to slow in the second half.
The group blamed weak demand for heavy plant and electrical equipment for
the drop in domestic orders. Most foreign growth came from the Americas and
Asia-Pacific.
The best results appeared to have been posted by divisions such as
automotive components and railways, which reported sales increases of 16 per
cent and 21 per cent respectively.
Siemens Nixdorf, the loss-making computer subsidiary, recorded a 2 per cent
turnover decline although domestic orders were reported to have increased
for the first time.
Semiconductors, a trouble spot, is believed to have returned to profit on
the back of a 43 per cent sales increase to DM3.1bn. Turnover at the Osram
lighting business, bolstered by the first-time consolidation of the US
Sylvania group, rose 82 per cent to DM5.4bn.
After adjustments for Osram and the pacemaker disposal, the group cut 21,000
jobs during the financial year, of which 17,000 were lost in Germany.
Meanwhile, the number of part-time workers rose 50 per cent to 21,000.

<TEXT>
Irish Life has reorganised its UK and Irish operations into two new units.
The retail businesses in Ireland and the UK are to be combined into one
unit, while the Irish corporate business will be combined with the
investment division into a second unit.
Previously, the Irish retail and corporate businesses operated as one unit
while the UK retail business formed part of the European operations.
Mr Brian Duncan, chief executive of Irish Life Ireland, is to step down at
the end of the year following the reorganisation.
Mr Duncan has worked for Irish Life since 1964, heading the Irish operation
since 1985. He is now expected to take up a position in the Irish health
insurance industry, being tipped to take over at VHI, the state-owned health
insurance company.
The reorganisation is 'designed to build upon the company's leadership
position in our core retail and corporate business markets in Ireland and to
underpin our strategic repositioning in the UK market,' explained Mr David
Kingston, managing director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Seet dropped 7p to 44p yesterday after the textiles group reported
sharply increased annual losses.
The group also announced that Homemaker Shops, its 47.7 per cent-owned
lossmaking associate, had sold its trading assets to Florida-based Linen
Supermarket; the directors estimate that Seet will receive between Dollars
1.71m and Dollars 1.96m (Pounds 1.19m) but under Stock Exchange rules will
have to seek shareholder approval to remit the proceeds as capital.
On turnover of Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 6.5m including Pounds 1.69m from
discontinued activities), pre-tax losses for the 12 months to April 30
widened from Pounds 60,840 to Pounds 321,160. The outcome took in losses of
Pounds 41,383 (profits of Pounds 75,336) at Homemaker and an exceptional
write down against the US operation of Pounds 130,957.
Nevertheless, Mr Jock Mackenzie, chairman, remained upbeat. There had been a
'significant improvement' since the year end, he said, with turnover at
Peter MacArthur, the group's leading tartan manufacturer, 'well ahead' on a
year-on-year basis.
The Homemaker disposal eliminated bank borrowings - interest charges dropped
from Pounds 148,853 to Pounds 26,672.
Losses per share were 8.88p (1.8p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Villiers Group, the USM-traded specialist engineering company, reported
pre-tax losses reduced from Pounds 2.83m to Pounds 1.54m for the year to
July 31. Turnover was 45 per cent ahead at Pounds 2.72m, compared with a
restated Pounds 1.87m.
Acquisitions contributed Pounds 1.21m to sales. Operating profits totalled
Pounds 11,000 (Pounds 338,000 loss).
The company, which is US-based, said its continuing operations had been
profitable since January. Following the disposal in June of its Starks Field
oil operations for Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.52m), its operating accounts
consisted entirely of engineering business. The second half had made a
positive overall contribution, reducing the Pounds 1.86m loss reported at
interim stage.
Losses per share improved from an adjusted 5.48p to 1.49p.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI discusses sale of sensors
business to Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn EMI, the music and rentals company, is in discussions with Racal
Electronics over the sale of its defence sensors businesses.
No price has been disclosed, but the businesses, based at Crawley, West
Sussex and Wells, Somerset, had turnover of about Pounds 75m last year.
The division employs 1,140 people. Its main products are specialised radars,
such as the Cymbeline weapon-locating radar, electronic counter-measures
equipment and command and control systems for land forces.
Thorn is in detailed discussions with Thomson of France over the sale of its
defence group business, which does not include the sensors operations. The
defence group's turnover is about Pounds 80m and its main activities are
fuses and electro-optics equipment.
Thorn has also sold its electronic security business. If both the defence
and sensors sales are completed, it will only be left with its transaction
ticketing operation outside its declared core areas. Preliminary discussions
on the ticketing business are also taking place.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has said that the company will concentrate on
its music production, music retailing and rental operations.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Coal Investments Pounds 10m in red - Deeper
losses and delay in mine reopening programme hit share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Coal Investments, the mining company, lost another 7 per cent of
their value yesterday after the company reported a 10-week delay in its mine
reopening programme and interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.2m.
The shares fall continues a trend which began when Coal Investments and the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers failed to secure nomination as preferred
bidder for either of the central English coal regions.
Yesterday's closing share price of 87p compares with a high, achieved early
last month, of 143p.
Losses for the six months to September 30 compared with a deficit of Pounds
68,000 last time. Turnover was Pounds 940,000 (nil) and losses per share 20p
(0.2p).
Mr Malcolm Edwards, chairman, said substantial progress had been made in
bringing the company's five mines back into production and the most
difficult part of the development had been completed.
Full production had been achieved at the small mine at Cwmgwili in Wales
following earlier geological problems.
Two of the four larger mines were now ready to start commercial production.
Mr Edwards said that next year's production and sales from all mines would
be greater than previously expected, although he declined to say by how
much.
The company said production delays resulted from late delivery of machinery.
The cumulative effect would be a lower than forecast level of production and
sales during the second half and consequent net cash outflow during that
period.
The company had agreed terms in principle for additional loan facilities of
Pounds 5m to meet this requirement.
It would refinance the loan as part of a further equity issue to be
announced soon.
Mr Edwards was confident about prospects for 1995-96 and beyond. Excellent
progress was being made in discussions with a number of coal buyers and
directors were 'confident that period sales contracts will be put in place
for the greater part of the group's production'.
COMMENT
Mr Edwards' high-flying shares have been floating back to earth recently,
but investors who have been in from the start can still reflect on a more
than fivefold increase in their holdings in the year since he took over. In
spite of the bidding disappointments and the production delays announced
yesterday, many investors are still prepared to put their faith in the
former British Coal marketing director. Losses could reach Pounds 14m this
year but providing the company can mine and sell 3m tonnes a year, as some
brokers believe is possible, it could make Pounds 14m in profits in 1995-96
excluding any effects of its holding in Mining Scotland, the preferred
bidder for British Coal's Scotland region. Profits of Pounds 14m would put
the shares on a p/e of about 5, rather low according to supporters. All very
well, but the company still has much to prove. It must get the next share
issue out successfully and it must show that it can meet its production and
sales targets. Failure to show solid progress by the end of the year could
meet with a stern response from the market.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Carlisle funds property expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Carlisle Group yesterday completed its transformation from a financial
services company to a property group with the announcement of a Pounds 14.4m
placing and open offer to help fund Pounds 29m of property purchases.
The transaction will almost double the size of Carlisle, whose primary
operating business is the Pepper Angliss &amp; Yarwood property agency.
Mr Nigel Wray, chairman and largest shareholder, said: 'The deal gives us
the balance sheet that will enable us to take the next step. We'd like to
trade out a lot of this portfolio and get more heavily involved in the
Mayfair area.'
The company is offering 75.6m new shares at 20 1/4 p on a 10-for-11 basis.
Carlisle will pay Pounds 4.5m for Strathinver, the investment holding
company which owns the portfolio. It has agreed to repay Pounds 4.3m of
Strathinver's Pounds 24.5m debt immediately, and will repay a further Pounds
6.95m by the end of the year.
Strathinver is 60 per cent owned by Coats Viyella. The family of Mr Jonathan
Harris, Carlisle's chief executive, holds 26 per cent. It reported pre-tax
losses of Pounds 470,000 for the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds
2.69m.
The company owns 16 commercial and industrial properties spread throughout
England, with current net rental income of Pounds 2.68m. This represents a
yield of more than 9 per cent. The deal, effectively a reverse takeover,
provides Carlisle with the financial muscle to develop as a property
investment group. Net assets will increase from Pounds 9.24m to Pounds 24m.
Trading in the shares was suspended and will not resume until December 8,
when dealings in the new shares are due to commence.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Receiver sells rump of RFS Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, receiver to RFS Industries, the former British Rail-owned
engineering company, has sold the last of its businesses to a management
buy-out, saving 350 jobs at the Doncaster-based company.
RFS was a Pounds 5m management buy-out from BR in 1987, and was the first
privatisation of its rolling stock manufacturing operations.
However, the company used its revitalised finances to expand into new
businesses, and having drastically over-extended itself, went into
receivership in December 1993.
The company's core rail passenger rolling stock and bogie design operations
were sold in May to Bombardier Eurorail for an undisclosed sum. This
represented about 80 per cent of group turnover.
The remaining overhaul operations are being sold to the MBO. RFS employees
will own 33 per cent of the company, with the remainder taken up by backers,
including Yorkshire Fund Managers and Sun Life.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rationalisation benefits Fenner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rationalisation, organic growth and new products helped Fenner, the power
transmission, fluid power and industrial belting group, lift full year
pre-tax profits from just Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 8.15m.
Operating profits before exceptional items for the year to August 31 rose 27
per cent to Pounds 12.2m, the highest for four years, while turnover slipped
from Pounds 201.6m to Pounds 200.8m. After adjusting for disposals and
exchange rate movements, turnover rose 5 per cent.
Exceptional items fell from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 2.6m as redundancy and
rationalisation costs fell. Interest charges dropped from Pounds 3.6m to
Pounds 1.9m, reflecting last September's rights issue and placing.
Earnings per share, after exceptional items, were 4.46p (6.97p losses).
Mr Mark Abrahams, chief executive, said the biggest achievement was the
turnround on the power transmission side - Fenner's largest business and one
that was formerly for sale.
In spite of continuing difficult trading conditions, the division reported
its first operating profit for three years.
The 'star performer,' said Mr Abrahams, was the polymer business, which was
helped by a 20 per cent rise in US sales and strong growth in hose and
ducting sales.
The fluid power division was helped by a strong performance in the US, and
from initial sales in continental Europe and the US of Fenner's new vapour
recovery system for use at petrol filling stat-ions.
Mr Abrahams said the system, which returns allegedly carcinogenic vapour
back to the filling station tank, could become a 'very material' part of the
division.
A final dividend of 1p (nil) will be paid as a foreign income dividend, a
measure introduced at the interim stage to save on ACT. The total for the
year is 1.5p (nil).
COMMENT
After recession, things are coming right at last for Fenner, due as much to
its own efforts as to improved market conditions. The main problem, power
transmission, has been sorted out and offers a solid, if unexciting, future.
The rights issue and placing has cut gearing from 54 to 10 per cent and
gives a better springboard from which to exploit new products - especially
the vapour recovery system. Organic growth and a further reduction in
exceptionals should give pre-tax profits of about Pounds 13m this year.
Assuming a lower tax charge, the prospective p/e is reasonable at 12 to 13.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Former tipster makes his mark - Carlisle's
reconstruction comes as no surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of Carlisle from a small financial services company into
an ambitious property investment company has caused little surprise, as it
carried the classic hallmark of its main shareholder, entrepreneur Mr Nigel
Wray.
The former tipster, who bought the Fleet Street Letter for Pounds 7,500 and
transformed it into the multi-million pound concern that eventually became
Carlton Communications, has had enormous success reconstructing shell
companies.
In 1988, his newsletter group Chartsearch launched a successful bid for
Burford, a fledgling USM-traded property group.
It has since been transformed into a Pounds 270m-capitalised group which
owns the Trocadero and a Pounds 100m prime portfolio acquired from Ladbroke
in February.
Mr Wray is hoping to do the same with Carlisle, a company he has known since
the mid-1980s, when he acquired a large holding in its former incarnation,
Somportex. Its primary business at the time was Slush Puppy. He sold the
bulk of his shares in 1987, but repurchased 33 per cent of Carlisle in
January at a substantially lower price.
Mr Wray's love of small companies dates from his days as a trainee fund
manager with Singer &amp; Friedlander.
After his success with Fleet Street Letter in the early 1980s, he launched a
spate of takeovers, including a bid for Singer 10 years after he left it as
a trainee.
He has managed to keep on good terms with his investments, and retains
directorships and small shareholdings in both Singer and Carlton.
His other main investment is a 13.5 per cent stake in The People's Phone,
the independent cellular phone service provider, which now has 180,000
subscribers and should make profits of Pounds 8m this year.
Mr Wray sees himself as an investor in people. He has focused on basic
businesses and backs managements in which he feels confident.
'My job is to make sure that I have got the right chief executive, that he's
doing his job well, and that he's got the optimum conditions in which to
work,' he said.
Property is a business he likes. At Burford he found a company run by
ambitious chief executive and fellow Mill Hill old boy Mr Nick Leslau.
His aim was to establish a conservatively financed group that could focus on
investing in problem properties, producing a reasonable rental stream but
requiring intensive management.
In the case of Carlisle, he is backing Mr Jonathan Harris, who worked his
way up from office boy to senior partner at property agency Pepper Angliss &amp;
Yarwood, Carlisle's only operating business.
Mr Harris, Carlisle's chief executive, has spent the last four years trying
to reverse the actions of a previous management which took the group into
stockbroking and Welsh gold mining, with disastrous results. He is finally
in a position to move forward.
'Carlisle's strategy is to acquire properties whose value can be enhanced by
intensive management', said Mr Wray, echoing the old policy of Burford.
He is keen that Carlisle should build up investment in Mayfair, funding
purchases through trading out existing properties and, if the market will
support it, new equity.
Carlisle's timing has not been immaculate. An earlier deal, involving the
purchase of some small properties from Burford, was blocked by the Stock
Exchange because the holding company did not have a three-year track record.
Carlisle's share price at the time was about 30p, compared with Tuesday's
closing price of 22 3/4 p. However, Mr Wray himself has fared better, having
bought in at 11p. Following the placement, his shareholding will be diluted
to 17.7 per cent, but he maintains that he is there for the long term. 'I
like the stock market, but when I look back, it is only the investments that
I've had for five or 10 years that count,' he said.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents improves 14% to Pounds
35m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrocomponents, the electronic, electrical and mechanical components
distribution group, yesterday announced a 14 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 35.5m.
Mr Roy Cotterill, chairman said: 'Our increased market presence coupled with
the new marketing programmes and other initiatives introduced during the
last 12 months continue to generate strong growth in both sales and
profits.'
Turnover from continuing operations grew by 18 per cent to Pounds 216.6m
(Pounds 183.1m) in the six months to September 30; operating profits
increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 34.3m (Pounds 29.7m).
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 11.2p (9.8p) and, as part of a
rebalancing process, the interim dividend is lifted to 3.25p (2.5p).
Turnover in the UK-based RS Components business rose by 13 per cent
reflecting continuing sales initiatives and increased market share. As
expected, RS's UK margins were slightly lower due to higher selling and
marketing costs.
New products, particularly mechanical products which are now featured in a
dedicated catalogue for the mechanical engineer, were one reason for the
sales growth. Mr Robert Lawson, chief executive, said the introduction of a
CD-Rom catalogue in July had exceeded expectations, with more than 35,000
disks being issued to customers.
RS International sales increased by 42 per cent, helped by the group's
greater penetration of overseas markets, particularly those in continental
Europe.
Radiospares Components in France continued to show strong growth, while a
significant advance was achieved in Germany. The Italian operations were
trading ahead of budget and expected to achieve profitability as planned
within 12 months.
Meanwhile, Pact International increased its sales by 7 per cent and incurred
a reduced loss in the seasonally weaker first half.
The group ended the period with net cash of Pounds 65.5m (Pounds 57.4m at
end-March).
COMMENT
Electrocomponents continues to produce the sound results expected of it. Net
margins will remain under pressure in the second half as marketing costs
continue to increase - but the group has proved itself adept at spotting and
exploiting new domestic market opportunities ahead of the competition.
Having developed and proved new concepts, such as the CD-Rom catalogue and
trade counters in the UK, the group's strategy is to take them overseas and
grow the international business. Pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds
83m this year, producing earnings of just over 26p. The shares, which gained
1p yesterday to 472p, are still trading well below their 12-month peak of
585p, reached in January. It deserves the premium rating represented by a
prospective p/e of 18.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ugland returns to the black with Pounds
1.28m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Ugland International yesterday rose 5p to 125p as the ship owner,
manager and dry dock operator swung into the black with interim pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.28m, against a Pounds 780,000 loss.
A new management team has been in place since last October at the company,
formerly known as Bristol Channel Ship Repairers. The Ugland family holds a
30 per cent stake.
Trading in the shares resumed last November at 108p following a three-month
suspension during which the company was reorganised.
In the six months to September 30, turnover jumped to Pounds 13.4m (Pounds
4m) following an improved performance from the shipping interests and the
April acquisition of Gerrards Rederi in Norway. Earnings per share were
4.13p (6.96p losses) and a dividend of 1.65p (nil) is declared.
Mr Andreas Ugland, executive chairman, said last year's Pounds 19m rights
issue and the addition of eight ships from the Gerrards acquisition - which
brought the total to 18 - had given the company a good base to increase
profits. Gerrards contributed Pounds 868,000 to the pre-tax figure.
Swansea Dry Docks, the ship repair business, fell to a Pounds 340,000 loss,
on sales of Pounds 1.36m, owing to stiff competition. However, a second dry
dock was opened in July and bookings had picked up after an intensive
marketing campaign, Mr Ugland added.
Net borrowings stood at Pounds 10.2m at the end of September, giving gearing
of 45 per cent.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: A new perspective on rankings / A look at a
revamped league table of M&amp;A advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quarterly league tables of mergers and acquisitions arouse as much scorn as
fascination on the part of the financial advisers they measure.
Investment banks - especially those disappointed with their standing -
complain that all they provide is a snapshot, and a blurred one at that. A
single deal can upturn the rankings and the criteria including a transaction
can be arbitrary.
Next week however Acquisitions Monthly, the leading compiler of M&amp;A data in
the UK, will publish a league table less vulnerable to dispute. Covering
public takeovers, both completed and failed, the report goes back nearly 10
years to the magazine's foundation in 1985.
SG Warburg heads the list, putting recent losses on trading and
disappointing interim results into perspective. Hoylake's abortive Pounds
13bn bid for BAT Industries in 1989 was the largest of Pounds 65.5bn of bids
in which Warburg was involved.
Morgan Grenfell and Schroders emerge as the other pre-eminent takeover
advisers of the decade. Morgan Grenfell has had its downs: the Guinness
affair damaged the firm's reputation, and this year has been quiet.
But the house, owned by and growing closer to Deutsche Bank, has been
adviser to one side or the other in more bids than any other: 226 to
Warburg's 198. 'I think it absolutely demonstrates that we dealt with the
Guinness situation and put it behind us,' said Mr Guy Dawson, a director of
Morgan Grenfell.
Goldman Sachs comes in as the highest placed US investment bank. UK
competitors caution that Goldman achieved its position by taking mainly
subsidiary roles in a few large deals. But the US house's speciality of bid
defence has paid off. Rivals admit Goldman has made inroads and the firm is
increasingly acting as lead adviser.
Calculating the volume of deals is controversial enough, but Acquisitions
Monthly has ventured into even more dangerous territory by producing figures
on financial advisers' success rate in hostile bids.
Few conclusions can be drawn, however, from what remain small samples.
Nevertheless traditional reputations, Warburg's for defence and Morgan
Grenfell's for attack, are borne out. Schroders and Goldman Sachs also stand
out as effective defenders of hostile bid targets, with Schroders helping to
fend off challenges in 59 per cent of the cases in which it was involved.
Morgan Grenfell and NM Rothschild offset apparently worse than average
records in defence with the strongest performances of the top 10 in advising
aggressors. 'We have a very high hit rate,' said Mr Russell Edey, head of
corporate finance at NM Rothschild. The pair's clients managed to take over
target companies more than half of the time.
Lazard Brothers, by contrast, is recorded as having won only two of 14
hostile bids on which it advised the aggressor. 'You have to be terribly
careful about what constitutes success,' warned Mr John Dear, head of
corporate finance. 'We are never afraid of advising a client that he should
walk away rather than pay a silly price. The winner of a bid can turn out to
be the loser in the long run.'
That is just one of several flaws remarked upon in Acquisition Monthly's
findings. One bid, that by Hoylake which failed, catapulted Warburg into
first place. Most important perhaps, public takeover activity has declined
since the 1980s and represents only a small part of investment banking. One
banker damns the league table with faint praise: 'It is an interesting
historical record.'
As long as compilers produce M&amp;A league tables, investment bankers will
gripe, no matter how broad the timespan. And they will continue to pore over
them.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Decline at Hambro Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambro Insurance Services Group yesterday blamed low levels of insurance
claims for the continued poor performance of its loss adjusting subsidiary
and a decline in group profits.
Mr Nicholas Page, managing director, said: 'The volume of claims has
declined and I am hoping that it has bottomed out. Pressure on volumes
translates into pressure on fees, particularly in the UK.'
The shares closed down 9p at 105p yesterday, 24 per cent lower than the
placing price of 138p when the group was floated in June last year.
It reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 3.25m) on turnover up 20
per cent to Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 33.4m) in the six months to September 30.
Cunningham, the loss adjusting division, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
432,000 (Pounds 372,000 profits).
Earnings per share fell to 2.94p (3.05p) but the interim dividend is again
1.85p.
The company yesterday announced a joint venture with Morden &amp; Helwig of the
US to create a worldwide loss adjusting and claims management network,
called Cunningham Lindsey International.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Last minute snag for Wellington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday created a last minute hitch for a new
underwriting company planning a stock market listing when its ruling council
failed to agree fresh rules for corporate investment in the insurance
market, writes Ralph Atkins.
Wellington Underwriting, which had announced plans to invest in seven
Lloyd's syndicates run by the Wellington managing agency, is due to complete
arrangements this week for placing 30m shares at 100p.
It had been awaiting Lloyd's approval, originally expected last Friday, for
arrangements to allow existing corporate vehicles to invest in others.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Positive reception for two trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two investment trusts raising capital to invest in emerging markets have had
a positive reception from institutional investors.
Murray Johnstone's new Murray Emerging Economies Trust has raised more than
Pounds 45m during its placing stage. A public offer for another 19.4m shares
at 100p (with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis) opened yesterday and
closes on November 29.
Foreign &amp; Colonial announced yesterday that applications in the
institutional placing of C shares in its Emerging Markets trust would be
scaled back.
Applications were received for nearly Pounds 100m-worth of shares, but the
placing was capped at Pounds 85m. Applications will be scaled back pro-rata.
A further 30m C shares at 100p are available through a public offer closing
on November 14. Existing ordinary shares in the trust are trading at a 7 per
cent premium.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Placing expected to value Hydro at more
than Pounds 10m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hydro International is coming to the market via a placing that will value
the company, which makes control systems for storm water control and sewage
separation, at between Pounds 10m and Pounds 11.5m.
The company, based in Clevedon, Avon, utilises 'vortex technology', the
principles of which have been known since Roman times. The vortex, or
whirlpool, effect is harnessed to regulate fluid flow.
The company has two main product ranges: flow control valves for flood
protection and storm control and hydro-dynamic separators for separating
solids from liquids, especially in the treatment of sewage and other waste
water. All are patented and low-cost.
Hydro expects recent environmental legislation in Europe and the US, which
has specified big cuts in pollutant discharge, to increase capital works in
its markets.
The company is raising about Pounds 3.7m, of which Pounds 570,000 will go to
existing shareholders. The balance is for research and development,
international expansion and the development of new markets.
The directors are retaining between 60 and 65 per cent of the equity.
The board is forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 480,000 for the year to
December 31. In 1993 it made Pounds 156,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.1m, and
in the six months to June 30, profits were Pounds 154,000 on turnover of
Pounds 2.4m.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Mercury faces cost cuts as profits fall by
Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The substantial restructuring programme at Mercury Communications announced
yesterday by Cable &amp; Wireless is part of a package of measures designed to
prepare the UK telecommunications company for increased market competition
in the second half of the 1990s.
Although Lord Young of Graffham, Cable &amp; Wireless chairman, declined to
elaborate on the scale of the job cuts at Mercury, the unions believe that
up to 10 per cent of Mercury's 11,400 jobs could go.
City analysts believe that the job reductions needed to reposition the
company could be even higher. Yesterday some were pencilling in charges of
up to Pounds 50m to cover the cost of reorganisation and suggesting that the
result could be annual savings of about Pounds 40m.
The need for cost reductions of this scale was highlighted by a Pounds 3m
fall in Mercury's first half operating profits to Pounds 96m, revealed in
C&amp;W's interim results yesterday - although the group insisted the programme
had been under consideration for several months.
The profit decline at Mercury, which largely reflects competitive and
regulatory factors, was a surprise to analysts and overshadowed the 11 per
cent rise in C&amp;W's pre-tax profits.
Solid growth in call volumes and a 50 per cent increase in customer lines
was not matched by profit improvement, which Lord Young and other senior
executives said was mainly because it had been hit harder than expected by
regulatory changes.
In particular Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said the company
estimated that the net effect of regulatory measures - including a double
price cut imposed on British Telecommunications by Oftel, the regulatory
authority, and substantially higher Access Deficit Charges - will reduce
Mercury's profits by Pounds 100m in the full year, compared with between
Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m in a more normal year.
Mr Mike Harris, the former Mercury chief executive who has been moved as
part of a senior management reshuffle to head a C&amp;W group development
division, said a review under way by Oftel is expected to alter the system
of ADCs which rival operators pay to BT.
Lord Young emphasised that Mercury was being repositioned to face the
growing competition in the UK telecommunications market.
As part of this process Mr Duncan Lewis, who was in charge of C&amp;W's US
operations and director of the group's business networks, has taken over as
Mercury's chief executive. He will announce details of the cost cuts and job
reductions at Mercury within the next month. At the same time Mercury's
structure is being reorganised into services and networks divisions.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Amersham restricted to Pounds 19.6m -
Analysts trim forecasts as 13% profits growth disappoints City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A disappointing performance in Japan and continental Europe limited first
half profits growth at Amersham International.
The health science group lifted pre-tax profits for the six months to
September 30 by 13 per cent to Pounds 19.6m (Pounds 17.4m) on sales up 6 per
cent at Pounds 163.1m (Pounds 153.7m).
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, acknowledged that the results were at the
low end of analysts' expectations. The share price fell 63p to 928p.
He said that the sluggishness of life sciences, the company's largest
division, had been caused by bureaucratic delays in government funding of
research, especially in Japan and France. Research laboratories are among
Amersham's best customers. In addition, the dollar's weakness boosted the
competitiveness of US rivals.
Life sciences' operating profits were Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 15.6m) on
turnover of Pounds 74.4m (Pounds 72.4m).
The industrial division, involved in industrial quality and safety
assurance, also disappointed. A changing product line had added to costs
without adding to sales, said Mr Castell. Operating profits dropped from
Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 1.3m.
The best performing division was healthcare. Operating profits rose to
Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 1.5m) thanks to the performance of new products -
Metastron, for cancer pain, and Myoview for imaging the heart. Turnover grew
from Pounds 54.7m to Pounds 62.3m.
Mr Castell said that the healthcare division would remain the 'major profits
driver in the near term'.
Earnings per share were 12 per cent higher at 20.8p (18.6p) and the interim
dividend is raised from 4.4p to 4.9p.
COMMENT
Amersham had the highest p/e in the UK health sector - 20.8 - until
yesterday's results. The rating was based on prospects for Metastron, a drug
which promises to take the company beyond medical imaging into the
potentially lucrative field of cancer treatment. However, doctors and drug
regulators are conservative folk. Approvals are slow in coming and buyers
must be persuaded to change their prescribing habits. Add to that
uncertainty over research spending in both public and private sectors as
costs remain under scrutiny, and it is just as well that analysts' forecasts
have now been trimmed. Pre-tax profits for the full year are likely to fall
well short of Pounds 50m, with earnings per share just making it to 50p.
Profits are forecast to grow at 20 per cent next year, giving roughly Pounds
57m pre-tax and earnings of 60p. The 1995-96 prospective p/e of 15.5 is
still close to the top of the sector. Amersham remains a long-term growth
stock, but investors should brace themselves for more short-term weakness.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barrs shrug off board's franchise warnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, whose voting shareholders are
split by a family feud, yesterday warned that the motor side of the group
could lose its distribution franchises.
The board said that two car manufacturers had threatened to terminate
franchises if rebel shareholders vote down its proposals to enfranchise the
non-voting A shares. These shares, owned almost entirely by institutions,
yesterday fell 21p to 263p, while the ordinary voting shares closed 15p down
at 540p.
The motor distribution division is expected to account for 70 per cent of
the leisure and motor group's profits this year.
The family feud broke out last month when Nicholas and Robert Barr asked
their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, to step down as chairman of the group. The
brothers, who claim majority support among voting shareholders, have also
requisitioned an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian
Small, finance director.
They say they can unlock shareholder value by splitting the group's two
divisions into stand-alone businesses.
However, the board has called another EGM to vote on enfranchisement on
November 25, one week before the rebels' EGM. Enfranchisement would reduce
family control from about 55 to 18 per cent.
The board seems likely to lose both EGM votes after Mr Kerry Firth, a
Barnsley-based businessman with 16 per cent of the ordinary shares,
re-affirmed his support for the rebels yesterday.
Mr Firth, who was asked by the board to referee a meeting with the Barr
brothers this week, said: 'Whatever support the board may have had from me
in the past, they will not get in the future.
'The company has underperformed under the present chairman. That is why
there is discomfort among shareholders and why they are giving their votes
to the brothers.'
Attempts to hold a meeting between Malcolm Barr and his nephews broke down
on Tuesday in a row over correspondence from the car manufacturers.
Nicholas Barr yesterday condemned the warnings over the distribution
franchises. 'This is a blatant attempt by the board to safeguard its own
position at the expense of shareholders,' he said.

Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent drinks group which gained a full
listing in July, yesterday announced interim profits ahead by more than 50
per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to September 25 increased from Pounds 1.41m
to Pounds 2.13m. Total sales rose to Pounds 24.5m from Pounds 22m last time,
when discontinued operations contributed Pounds 425,000.
Mr Peter Dickson, managing director and great-grandson of Mr Peter Yates,
the founder, said that since the end of the first half, like-for-like sales
were almost 9 per cent ahead compared with a flat trend in the industry
generally. 'We believe we are pulling away,' he added.
The shares, placed at 140p, rose 6p yesterday to 181p.
Operating profits at the core Yates's Wine Lodges, which now comprise 36
outlets, rose 30 per cent to Pounds 2.91m on sales up 24 per cent at Pounds
16.5m. The group, which also has 15 other outlets, is opening three further
Wine Lodges next month.
Sales in the wholesale side declined by 5 per cent to Pounds 5.88m as the
group carried out its strategy of switching from secondary to direct
wholesale. Operating profits were ahead from Pounds 82,000 to Pounds 98,000.
The group has set itself a target of a 5 per cent return on the wholesale
business and Universal Wines and Spirits, which supplies drinks in
lightweight packaging to the airline industry. In August, Yates issued
16,760 shares to acquire the 25 per cent of Universal that it did not
already own. The division made profits of just Pounds 2,000 on sales of
Pounds 2.16m.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 499,000 following the Pounds
10m placing. The group expects its continuing expansion to lift borrowings
to Pounds 3m by the year end.
Earnings were 4.2p (3p). The interim dividend is 1p - in line with the
flotation forecast.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo fends off attack on patents for
Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the drug company, has fended off one of several attacks on patents
protecting its biggest selling drug, Zantac, for ulcer treatment.
This increases the chances that Zantac will not have competition from
generic rivals for a year beyond the expiry of one of the drug's patents at
the end of 1995. Zantac's US sales are running at about Dollars 2.2bn
(Pounds 1.34bn) a year.
A US district court has rebuffed an application by Novopharm, the Canadian
generics maker, that part of a Glaxo suit for patent infringement against
Novopharm be rejected. The decision means Glaxo's case goes ahead as before.
The first patents on Zantac expire in December 1995, and the 30-month delay
from the patent suit filing should protect the drug from competition until
late 1996.
Mr Leslie Dan, Novopharm chief executive, said yesterday if he had secured a
partial dismissal of Glaxo's case, his case to have the 30-month period cut
by the court would have been much stronger. Novopharm said that its generic
version of Zantac would cost between 30 and 50 per cent less than Glaxo's
drug.
Novopharm is also challenging the validity of a second patent on Zantac,
which expires in 2002. Mr Dan said challenges to both patents will continue
and that he remained 'optimistic'.
Separately, Novopharm has taken a step towards launching a generic version
of Zantac based on the later patent. That step is a type of approval from
the US Food and Drug Administration called a conditional Abbreviated New
Drug Application.
Early launch would only be possible if Novopharm secured a reversal of last
year's lower court decision upholding Zantac's 2002 patent. The case is with
the US court of appeals.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bibby falls Pounds 10.7m into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Bibby &amp; Sons, the conglomerate, yesterday reported a tumble into pre-tax
losses for the year to September 24, after exceptional charges.
However, the shares rose 10p to 70p as operating profits rose from Pounds
21.1m to Pounds 29.6m.
Bibby, which is 79 per cent owned by Barlow of South Africa, announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 7.07m profits) on turnover down at
Pounds 764.6m, compared with Pounds 791.5m.
Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 30.6m, relating to the Pounds 41.7m
disposal in May of the agricultural feeds business to Associated British
Foods, and the cost of restructuring what is now the industrial division.
The feeds business contributed turnover of Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.39m), and
there were losses of Pounds 20.4m from its disposal, the closure of
operations and goodwill.
Within continuing operations, there were losses of Pounds 6.72m from
disposals, closures and goodwill and other restructuring costs of Pounds
3.48m.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, said: 'The restructuring of the group is
mostly done and we have fully provided for everything we can think of.'
Interest charges were reduced to Pounds 10m (Pounds 14.1m). Borrowings fell
to Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 122.8m) after the sale of the feeds business and a
building in Spain. Lower rates, especially in Spain, also helped.
Behind the operating profits rise, lay a sharp reduction in losses from
capital equipment to Pounds 865,000 (Pounds 7.15m) and a rise in the
industrial division to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 9.05m). The agricultural
business made profits of Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 3.2m) and materials handling,
Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 16.1m).
Losses per share emerged at 11.99p (earnings of 2.26p) and the total
dividend is lifted to 3p (2p) via a final of 2p. A special dividend of 2p
was also paid following the disposal.

FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ingham falls to Pounds 853,000 after
provision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ingham, the York-based motor parts, worsted spinning and property group,
reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 1.47m to Pounds
853,000, for the six months to end September.
Turnover was slightly ahead at Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 13.6m).
The result included the provision for an exceptional administrative expense
of Pounds 210,000. This was in respect of potential compensation payable to
Mr Nicholas McMahon Turner, the former chief executive, for loss of office.
Profits before tax and interest slipped in both the motor group and the
property division, but more than doubled for the group's spinning company,
in spite of a steady rise in wool prices.
Earnings per share were down from 7.1p to 3.2p, with the interim dividend
unchanged at 1.75p.

FT  10 NOV 94 / 'Go West]' echoes in Barclays' ears: Lessons a UK bank has
learnt from a promiscuous foray into the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These days, it seems every European bank wants to be in the US investment
banking business. Bank executives from Deutsche Bank, Credit Lyonnais and
Union Bank of Switzerland, among others have talked this year about growing
their trading and deal-making skills to complement their lending and foreign
exchange businesses in the US.
Barclays is no exception. After a disastrous foray into corners of the US
financial market in the 1980s, the UK bank may have been pulling in its
horns recently - earlier this week, for instance, it said it was in talks to
sell its profitable US asset-based lending business. But it is now also
focusing on growth.
No bank with pretensions to serving big companies can afford not to have a
substantial presence in New York, according to Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays
chief executive. 'The investment banking business internationally demands
dollar capability,' he said.
Also, techniques and skills developed in the US derivative and other
financial markets are a driving force around the world. 'New York is the
centre of imagination and ideas in the (capital) markets,' said Mr Taylor.
With a number of foreign banks pursuing the same goal - and some of the US's
own commercial banks moving into investment banking - is there enough
business, let alone enough skilled traders and deal-makers, to go around?
Like other foreign and US institutions, Barclays lent liberally to US
companies at low margins during the 1980s, hoping to forge relationships
which would yield more profitable business later. It didn't work.
Mr Taylor now refers to that era as one of 'extreme promiscuity'. 'Nobody
built any particular loyalty or any particular strength.'
There were also bad credit judgments. Last year, Barclays took a Pounds 346m
charge against its US loans, Pounds 1bn of which were classified as
non-performing at the end of 1993. Like others, it was caught out by
excessive property lending.
Now, the bank is busy cutting the number of companies it services in the US.
'Banks are getting back to the idea of having fewer and deeper
relationships,' said Mr Taylor. At the start of 1993, Barclays did business
with 900 US companies: that number has been cut to around 200.
It has also pulled out of a range of retail or small business finance
businesses entered during the 1980s. Besides the asset finance company,
virtually the only one left is Barclays American Mortgage, which services
mortgage loans.
In the past three years, these mistakes - and charges for shedding excessive
infrastructure - have cost the bank Pounds 1.1bn. The continuing part of its
business, by comparison, made profits of Pounds 168m last year.
Barclays is now trying to graft an investment banking business on to what is
left. In this effort, it has some things working in its favour. Its name
still scores high marks for recognition in the US and its reputation has
barely been tarnished by problems in the UK. Mr Taylor calls this the 'halo
effect'.
The era of expansionism has left the bank with a base of customers on which
it can build. 'However expensive an entry it was, we have got the
relationships,' said Mr Taylor. It was one of six banks, and the only non-US
one, which committed Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) each to back the (ultimately
unsuccessful) bid for Paramount Communications by QVC. Also this year it
co-arranged a Dollars 325m financing to back a merger of two cellular
companies to form Western Wireless.
Taylor calls commitments like that to QVC 'the strategic use of the (bank's)
balance sheet' - providing the bridging finance or underwriting to support a
big corporate transaction. In future, he says, Barclays plans to use its
capital in this way, rather than take on loan assets.
For this approach to work, Barclays will have to avoid the sort of
temptations which led it astray before.
Mr Taylor seems wary of getting drawn into new areas such as US equities.
'The market is very well supplied with strong players at the moment.'
The bank will also have to rebuild morale and management in the US after
years of upheaval. That process may not be smooth: while Mr Richard Webb,
head of the US bank, has handled the clean-up smoothly, the two joint-heads
of the investment banking business in New York - Mr John Sutherland and Mr
Malcolm LeMay - have left in recent months.
Mr Taylor earlier this year professed himself happy with the US management.
But he added: 'The challenge for Barclays in managing its US operations is
how you move that management group over the next few years when you're
coming out of a turnround phase into a development phase.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / C&amp;W up 11% as Mercury faces shake-up: Telecoms group to cut
jobs and costs - HK unit surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday announced a
'substantial cost and head-count reduction programme' at its UK-based
Mercury Communications subsidiary while reporting an 11 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits.
Lord Young, chairman, declined to be drawn on the scale of the likely job
cuts. However, the National Communications Union said it believed job losses
at Mercury would total around 1,100 and analysts suggested that up to 2,000
of Mercury's 11,400 jobs could be at risk.
Pre-tax profits increased in line with expectations to Pounds 567m in the
six months to September 30 from Pounds 507m a year ago on turnover which
grew by 9 per cent to Pounds 2.33bn (Pounds 2.54bn). The shares closed down
7p at 392p.
The results were underpinned by the continued strong performance of Hongkong
Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by C&amp;W and contributed Pounds 417m
(Pounds 365m) to overall operating profits of Pounds 592m.
Improved group profits came in spite of a surprise Pounds 3m decline in
first-half operating profits at Mercury, which fell to Pounds 96m on
turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 797m.
Mercury's decline came in spite of a 21 per cent increase in call volumes
and a 50 per cent increase in customer lines to 2.1m. Growth in residential
customer lines was particularly strong at 54 per cent.
Lord Young said that although Mercury continued to gain market share it had
been hit by the effects of regulatory change, which had resulted in pricing
pressure and substantially higher access deficit charge payments to British
Telecommunications.
'Clearly we are disappointed by Mercury's financial performance but we do
not intend to rely on regulatory change alone to ameliorate the position,'
he said. 'We are therefore restructuring Mercury which will enable us to
introduce a substantial cost and headcount reduction programme.'
Lord Young said details of the restructuring measures would be announced
within the next month by Mercury's new chief executive, Mr Duncan Lewis,
appointed earlier this week.
In spite of the setback at Mercury, Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive,
insisted the group's results 'were a good performance marred only by the
difficulties of Mercury'. Operating profits grew by 17 per cent in spite of
the underlying cost pressures which meant that operating costs as a
percentage of turnover edged up to 30.7 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 11.9 (11.1p) and an interim dividend of 2.83p
(2.6p) per share was declared, a 9 per cent increase on last year.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Co-op Bank owner considers proposals for sell-off plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of part or all of the Co-operative Bank is being considered by its
owner, the Co-operative Wholesale Society.
SG Warburg, the investment bank, has the commission to examine selling
shares in the bank to another co-operative financial institution. Since last
year, contact is believed to have been made with co-operative banks in
Canada, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland.
The CWS board discussed a paper on the bank's future last week, but decided
to take no short-term action.
The Manchester-based bank is a small player, with only 3,500 employees and 2
per cent of the UK retail market. However, it is strong in two niches: gold
cards and local government accounts.
It has also attracted customers by refusing to do business with companies
that it considers insensitive to environmental issues.
The Co-op Bank's asset base was Pounds 3.4bn in its accounts for the year to
January 8, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.8m.
The CWS was founded in 1863 and set up the bank nine years later. As owner
of 100 per cent of the equity, the CWS has to guarantee the bank's capital
base.
Returns have been poor because the bank has had to retain profits to keep
its base strong.
An alternative recommended in last week's board discussion paper was to
transfer ownership to the Co-operative Insurance Society, although this
would be unlikely to be approved by the Bank of England.
The bank's chairman, Mr Tom Agar, former chief executive of the Lincoln
Co-operative Retail Society, was unable to attend the meeting and Mr Terry
Thomas, chief executive, does not have a seat on the CWS board, which is
elected by the co-operative movement.
Mr Thomas, who joined from Barclays Bank, has played a key role in the Co-op
Bank's recent emergence.
The CWS came close to selling 49 per cent of its equity five years ago to DG
Bank of Germany.
The deal depended on the Co-op Bank winning the competition for Girobank,
which the government unexpectedly sold to the Alliance and Leicester
Building Society.

FT  10 NOV 94 / CU advances to Pounds 305m on UK non-life revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the large composite insurer, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits up Pounds 165m at Pounds 305m for the first nine months, helped
largely by the revival in the UK non-life insurance sector.
Mr John Carter, chief executive, said many UK underwriting margins 'remain
favourable' with claims relatively low and many premiums stable or rising.
But he acknowledged that trading conditions in UK insurance were unlikely to
remain as good in the next few years.
Underlining the extent of competition - particularly from direct
telephone-based insurers - the company reported that the number of private
motor vehicles insured by it had fallen 18 per cent over the past year.
The results were broadly in line with expectations and the group's shares
ended unchanged at 543p.
In continental Europe, strong growth in general insurance premiums helped
increase operating profits in the Netherlands to Pounds 64m from Pounds 53m,
but elsewhere CU made an operating loss before taxation of Pounds 6m against
Pounds 24m.
Contributions from the US were hit by bad weather and catastrophe claims. US
operating profits before tax fell to Pounds 44m from Pounds 50m.
Mr Carter said UK growth had been affected by a tough market for pension
products but he forecast that the Securities and Investment Board's proposed
programme for reviewing past sales of personal pension policies would not
have a material effect on its statutory life profits.
For the group as a whole, profits from the life business increased to Pounds
94m from Pounds 86m. Growth in new life annual premiums in continental
Europe was partly offset by lower UK sales of individual life and pension
products. Operating results for general insurance jumped to Pounds 202m from
Pounds 57m. Total premium income in the first nine months was Pounds 4.50bn
against Pounds 4.49bn.
The results were the first since CU acquired on October 6 the French insurer
Groupe Victoire, which will be included in the final quarter results.
Shareholders' funds at September 30 totalled Pounds 2.1bn compared with
Pounds 2.5bn at December 31, 1993. The drop largely reflected the poor
performance of bond and equity markets.
Operating ratio in the UK - which measures claims, commissions and expenses
as a percentage of premiums - amounted to 97 per cent in the first nine
months, against 104 per cent.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Crime compensation scheme ruled unlawful: Appeal court says
home secretary abused powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, KEVIN BROWN and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's new compen-sation scheme for victims of violent crime,
introduced in April, was ruled unlawful by the Appeal Court yesterday.
The decision is a further setback for Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary.
The court said he had acted 'unlawfully' and 'abused his powers' by
implementing the scheme without referring it to parliament.
Mr Howard said last night he would be appealing against the decision to the
Lords.
The new tariff-based scheme sets fixed levels of compensation for different
categories of injury, replacing the previous scheme based on personal injury
compensation rules, which took account of individual circumstances.
The government said the new scheme was necessary to curb compensation costs
and unless changes were made, the annual cost of payments would rise from
Pounds 224m to Pounds 550m by 2001.
The ruling prompted immediate opposition demands for Mr Howard's
resignation. It comes on top of a series of parliamentary rebuffs and prison
security scandals which have already severely damaged his reputation as home
secretary.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, said Mr Howard had 'arrogantly and
foolishly' rejected Labour attempts to give the scheme legal backing. Mr
Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, said the home secretary's position
was 'untenable'. Opposition leaders pointed out that Mr Howard ignored
warnings about the scheme from several eminent judges. Lord Carlisle, former
Conservative minister who chairs the criminal injuries compensation board,
opposed it.
Senior Conservative backbenchers said the ruling would undermine support for
Mr Howard, who is under fire from the right for failing to be effective on
law and order.
The decision was a victory for the TUC and 10 trades unions, led by the Fire
Brigades Union, all of whose members run the risk of criminal injury at
work.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the judgment promised to stop Mr
Howard 'doing great damage and injustice' to many victims of crime.
Compensation awards are running at roughly one-tenth the level under the old
scheme. Mr Ken Cameron of the FBU said firefighters killed or injured as a
result of arson received Pounds 750,000 in compensation last year. Under the
new scheme they would have received Pounds 75,000.
If the government loses in the Lords, awards made since April will have to
be reassessed under the old scheme.
The Court said the 1988 Criminal Justice Act contained measures to put the
old common law scheme on a statutory footing. The act gave the home
secretary discretion as to when but not whether the statutory scheme should
be introduced.
He was therefore under a legal duty to implement the statutory scheme or
repeal the legislation before introducing a new one.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Private hospital fails despite Pounds 30m aid from
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Health Care International, the Scottish private hospital opened four months
ago to cater for overseas patients, went into receivership yesterday when
its bankers failed to agree a rescue package.
The hospital, located in an enterprise zone at Clydebank near Glasgow, had
been unable to attract enough patients - only 20 of its 260 beds were
occupied yesterday. Its failure is highly embarrassing for the government,
which committed a total of Pounds 30m to the Pounds 180m project.
Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, accused Scottish Office
ministers of 'recklessly gambling public money on a shaky, ill-conceived
project', while the Scottish TUC described the hospital as 'a harebrained
scheme which common sense indicated was doomed to fail'.
HCI, which employes 400 people, hit a financial crisis in late September
because of a severe shortage of patients from its targeted markets of Italy,
Greece and the Middle East.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said the possibility of the hospital's now
being taken over by the NHS was 'not part of our plan'. He hoped it would be
possible for the project to be taken forward following receivership 'in
pursuit of the original objectives of the company'.
Though modern, the hospital is unlikely to interest other UK independent
hospital operators, having already shown that a Scottish hospital aimed at
the overseas market is not viable. Its use as a conventional private
hospital is restricted by its location in an area with powerful pro-NHS
traditions.
London private hospitals used to rely heavily on overseas patients,
particularly from the Middle East, but this market has reduced in recent
years. Most hospital operators now balance overseas work with UK patients.
Samuel Montagu, leader of the syndicate of five banks lending to HCI,
appointed Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen as joint
receivers.
Although new equity funding was available from the Abu Dhabi Investment
Company, the French bank Credit Lyonnais, one of five in the lending
syndicate, refused to agree to the package, precipitating receivership. It
said yesterday a viable refinancing plan had not been forthcoming.
HCI was conceived by two Harvard professors, Dr Angelo Eraklis and Dr
Raphael Levey. The equity investors are led by Harvard Management, which
invests money for Harvard University.
The Pounds 30m of public funds offered to HCI included Pounds 22m in
regional selective assistance, only some of which had been paid. Scottish
Enterprise, the development body, had lent HCI Pounds 4m and invested Pounds
1.4m.

FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Cable and Wireless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless has traditionally enjoyed a premium rating. Investors
have been impressed with its strategy of taking cash from its enormously
profitable Hongkong Telecom subsidiary and reinvesting it in start-up
ventures elsewhere. Yesterday's bad news from Mercury Communications, C&amp;W's
largest such investment by far, raises doubts over whether the premium is
justified any longer.
The cost cutting announced yesterday is certainly necessary to revive
Mercury's fortunes; any regulatory relief on the fees it pays BT for
channelling calls over the larger company's network would also be a bonus.
But neither will be sufficient to raise Mercury's return on capital, which
fell to around 11.5 per cent on an annualised basis in the half year to
end-September, to an adequate level. While Mercury puts its house in order,
BT is also cutting costs and new competitors are entering the market
targeting Mercury's best customers.
If C&amp;W is unable to earn good returns on cash recycled from Hongkong
Telecom, a central factor in preserving its premium rating will be the
possibility of breaking up the group. Once the market value of C&amp;W's 57.5
per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom is subtracted, there is little value left
in the rest of the group's operations. The snag with this argument is not
simply that C&amp;W's management has set its face firmly against such
unbundling. Any attempt to off-load the Hongkong Telecom stake might so
depress its price as to defeat the purpose of the exercise.

FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the opacity of Siemens' accounting, it is hard to say exactly what
caused the worse-than-expected fall in pre-extraordinary profits in the year
to end-September. But the figures undoubtedly reflect poor performance on
its enormous investment portfolio, as well as continuing losses at Nixdorf
and mounting price pressures in telecommunications.
Greater segmental disclosure - due for the first time in December - will
focus the spotlight on the group's structural and operating weaknesses. The
details will highlight the fact that tough rationalisation is necessary if
Siemens is to improve its lamentable earnings performance and restore its
international competitiveness. So far, its approach to cost-cutting and
restructuring looks kid-gloved compared with that of international
competitors or even other large German industrial companies. The number of
domestic employees fell a modest 7 per cent in the past financial year. The
decision to sell the US pace-maker business earlier this year was a step
towards defining core businesses, but full-scale restructuring looks as
distant as ever.
Siemens suffers from the sheer scale of its liquid resources. They cushion
the group from the pressures felt by less well-padded groups. The unchanged
dividend shows that Siemens is not contemplating giving the money to
shareholders. Investors, for their part, should continue to avoid the stock
until there are clearer signs that management is getting to grips with
Siemens' notoriously stodgy culture.

FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Underwriting fees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a hostile reaction to Mr Paul Marsh's report on UK
sub-underwriting commissions from some sections of the City. The current
system for raising capital through rights issues suits the City very well.
Many institutions and merchant banks fear that the OFT-sponsored report will
provide useful ammunition for those seeking to move London towards the New
York model for raising equity.
But the report does not question the virtues of the rights issue system. It
merely argues that the fixed 1.25 per cent commission paid to
sub-underwriters provides them with excess returns. Mr Marsh calculates
these by using an option valuation method to establish a 'fair' price in
each case. This is based partly on the historic volatility of a particular
share price which his critics argue is likely to change during a rights
issue. In fact, the evidence suggests volatility actually falls.
Other criticisms of the methodology are somewhat undermined by the fact that
some aggressive investment banks are using similar techniques to price their
risks.
If Mr Marsh's case that there are excess returns looks strong, it is less
clear what should be done. The authorities could simply force a reduction in
the flat rate, though that would still mean strong issuers were subsidising
the weak. Issuers themselves could haggle with their advisers and threaten
to go elsewhere. In practice, they do not because they are afraid that their
plans will leak out. But maybe the conventional wisdom that impending rights
issues must be kept secret needs to be challenged.

FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Capitol confusion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The markets' initial reaction to the Republicans' mid-term triumph was
euphoria. In many cases, the rationale was little more than the mantra that
Republicans are good for business. In a few sectors, the increases were more
justifiable. Defence stocks soared on hopes that traditionally hawkish
Republicans could halt the decline in military spending. The effective death
of the Clintons' healthcare package pushed up drugs stocks on both sides of
the Atlantic, even though its demise will do nothing to ease margin
pressures caused by the consolidation of the industry's customer base.
Then reality set in. The risk that Republican isolationists could block
ratification of the recent world trade agreement - with all the consequent
dangers for the world economy - has increased. Most worrying is that prudent
fiscal policy could be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency. With
only two years to go before the presidential elections, Mr Clinton and the
Republicans could start competing over who can deliver the largest tax cuts.
Given that taxes are easier to cut than spending, the budget deficit could
once again start expanding. The markets fear that could boost inflation,
unsettle bonds and equities and require even larger increases in interest
rates.
Any hopes that the elections would reduce uncertainty have been unfulfilled.
Indeed, yesterday's erratic movements probably represent a harbinger of
greater market volatility brought by the Republicans' victory.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Brussels blocks German pay-TV venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday blocked a multimedia deal among three of
Germany's most powerful companies after deciding it would prevent other
competitors from entering the German market for pay television.
Using for only the second time its powers to block joint ventures, the
Commission competition authorities argued that the deal was incompatible
with the single market.
At stake was a proposed venture between Bertelsmann, the world's second
largest media group; the Kirch group, one of Germany's biggest private
television companies; and Deutsche Telekom. The companies intended to set up
a company - MSG - to provide infrastructure, marketing and booking services
for commercial pay-TV.
Some sections of the multimedia industry said the Commission's decision
would frustrate the development of multimedia services in Europe.
'A practical entrepreneurial attempt to create a market of the future has
been prevented,' Kirch said. 'The decision means that the creation of a
digital communications infrastructure with the required management will not
be possible.'
In July, the Commission launched an investigation, fearing the venture could
create a dominant position in the German pay-TV market.
'In principle a joint venture like MSG is desirable because it is able to
implement new technologies such as digital television,' said Mr Karel Van
Miert, commissioner with special responsibility for competition policy. 'But
the structural features of MSG would lead to a protection of the market for
services as well as for digital pay-TV.'
The market for pay-television programmes and services is expected to expand
as digital television is introduced. The Commission said the prospects were
particularly good in Germany because of the high number of households - 21m
 -which already receive television by cable or satellite.
Bertelsmann said yesterday the ruling had, in the short term, closed
possibilities for smaller programme producers to access future television
technology. 'At the moment the merger partners are the only people in
Germany who have the technical and administrative capabilities to run such a
business,' it said.
Mr Van Miert denied the ruling was a setback for Europe's multi-media
industry, arguing that it was possible for cross-border deals to take place
without individual markets being closed off.

Questioning an Argentine's credential as a political prisoner during the
'dirty war' is asking for trouble - particularly if he happens to be the
president.
Carlos Menem has filed a libel action against one of the country's sparkiest
daily newspapers, the leftist Pagina 12, after its editors cast doubt on his
claim to have been tortured under the former military dictatorship. On
October 30 the paper quoted former prisoners as saying that Menem - who was
arrested after a 1976 military coup ousted president Isabel Peron - was
never tortured and that he had cried upon being arrested.
Pagina 12 seems undaunted. 'What we have here is somebody who is sick in the
head. Before we poked fun at him, but now the jokes are becoming
monotonous,' is the printed riposte by columnist Osvaldo Soriano.
Few prominent libel cases ever seem to reach court in Buenos Aires. But
given that Menem hopes to be re-elected in 1995, maybe this one might.

Whatever the outcome of the latest allegations about sleaze in British
football, one has to look overseas to find the juiciest scams.
In 1983 Hungary uncovered a match-fixing conspiracy, resulting in 260
players and 14 referees being suspended and 75 people convicted of criminal
offences. Even that doesn't quite match the Yugoslav teams involved in a
crucial 1979 end-of-season match; the score was 134-1 (a goal every 40
seconds), which would have been an all-time record - but for the fact that a
deal had been struck before kick-off.

It must say something about Turkey - but what? - that the country's largest
individual taxpayer should be Matild Manukyan, doyenne of Istanbul's madams.
Last year she was busy enough to justify a Dollars 722,751 tax bill.
She went along to an Istanbul chamber of commerce prize-giving ceremony for
top taxpayers. But instead of receiving her gold plaque from the hands of
president Suleyman Demirel himself, she was fobbed off with the chamber's
vice-president.
Did she feel offended? Maybe. But she must be getting used to this kind of

The remarkable economic progress of Humberside, in the north of England,
will be further confirmed today by the final granting of planning permission
and funding for a Pounds 520m gas-fired power station at Grimsby.
And last year the Humber estuary shifted more than 60m tonnes of cargo,
knocking the Thames off its pedestal as the UK's biggest seaborne trading
zone, and putting the Channel tunnel's projected 8m tonnes a year into
perspective.
So why choose London for the presentation, which is intended to promote
business opportunities associated with a new offshore terminal? Humberside
county council says about 100 people will turn up for today's beano at the
Selfridges Hotel, and that far fewer would bother to travel north.
Some confusion here, surely. Those who would travel north - it's hardly a
time-zone change - would thus be establishing themselves as genuinely
interested in the area. But how many at Selfridges will simply be taking a
swift free lunch?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Bill Clinton it never rains but it pours. Now he's been deserted by
David Gergen, the shrewd 52-year-old spin-doctor who helped presidents
Nixon, Reagan and Bush in many a jam.
Gergen is off to teach at Duke University, where his father was once head of
the mathematics department. Clinton brought Gergen, former editor of
magazine US News and World Report, into the White House in May 1993 to stop
the administration drowning in a tide of disasters. Gergen scored: Clinton's
approval rating jumped from 37 to 60 per cent in February this year.
But some prophetic words were printed in February this year by The Economist
magazine: 'Watch the Gergenometer. When it reads 'jump ship', it should be a
good indication of when one consummate insider reckons this presidency has
peaked.'
At Duke, Gergen will be teaching a course in 'governing in today's America'.
He should sign up the Clintons, pronto.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Planning for higher prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few things better illustrate the benefits of competition than the recent
price war in British retailing. The consumer has enjoyed value for money to
a far greater extent than in the consumption-led recovery of the 1980s.
Retailers who have kept prices under control have been rewarded with higher
volumes and sales values. The wider benefit has come from the powerful
restraining influence on prices generally. What is the risk that this
virtuous circle may break down?
Producer price inflation is an obvious potential villain of the piece. Yet
the fear here may well be exaggerated. The message from Marks and Spencer,
which reported interim profits earlier this week, was that its ability to
pass on producer price rises is minimal. Other leading retailers have told
much the same story. If they are right, producers who face rising prices for
raw materials and imported manufactures may simply confront the same choice
as the retailers. Either they raise prices and risk an immediate loss of
market share; or they join in the competition and hope that increased volume
will offset their lower margins.
A more plausible ground for concern lies in the peculiarities of the present
disinflationary process. The unexpected price sensitivity of consumers is
partly a reflection of recession; also of the stretched state of the
personal sector balance sheet after the borrowing binge of the 1980s. Time
and the precautionary urge to pay down debt from increased earnings could
ultimately lead to a more insouciant consumer attitude towards prices. Yet
the most powerful longer-run force threatening the current price discipline
probably lies in planning policy.
Retail property
The present retail price war is to a considerable degree a reflection of
oversupply in retail property. This stemmed from a relaxation in the
approach to planning consents in the 1980s, particularly in relation to
out-of-town shopping centres. Confronted with an unexpectedly liberal
environment big retailers were tempted simultaneously to expand. The result
was overdevelopment. An excessive number of new outlets contributed
significantly to the high degree of price restraint that has marked the
economic recovery.
Under Environment Secretary John Gummer this period of liberalisation is
drawing to a close. Last week he declared that the balance must be tilted
away from out-of-town shopping centres back to the town centre. Henceforth
the emphasis in planning will be on the revitalisation of town centres, the
building of communities and reduced dependence on the motor car. Shopping
malls on by-passes are out of favour.
Local monopoly
Few would quarrel with Mr Gummer's aspiration to enhance the quality of
life. But whether his policies will achieve the desired goal is a moot
point. The first impact of more restrictive planning will be to reinforce
the local monopoly of those out of town retailers who have not yet been
subjected to additional competition. It will strengthen the hand of smaller
retailers in town who have weak buying power, few economies of scale, high
fixed costs and thus a poor capacity to offer discount prices. More
generally, a restrictive planning policy will tend to favour the inefficient
retailer relative to those better able to deal with competition.
Meantime the new emphasis on town centre redevelopment raises longstanding
questions about congestion and the ability to provide adequate car parking
space. While Mr Gummer insists that 'people want a sensible balance in the
siting of shopping centres', the experience of retailers seems to be that
people like using their cars.
Either way, if this shift in policy does prove to be more restrictive
overall, those retailers and property developers now suffering from the
consequences of overdevelopment will be cheering in the aisles. Just as
George Brown made fortunes for countless property developers with his 1964
ban on office building in London, so Mr Gummer will have provided large
windfall gains to those whose planning consents came through both in time
and in the right place.
We are back to the 1960s - or is it the garden-city-minded 1940s? Either
way, the consumer will not be a beneficiary.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The new US prospect
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Voting against government is one thing: making it work better is another.
The Republican party won its landslide in Tuesday's Congressional elections
by campaigning against President Clinton, and against a Democrat-controlled
Congress.
The fear must be that the new rulers of Congress will bring the same
negativism to the job of government.
Come January, Republicans will have control over both Houses of Congress,
for the first time in over 40 years. For many, the results of the election
are a recipe for two years of unrelenting legislative gridlock.
It was certainly difficult to see the seeds of bipartisanship in the
campaign.
However, the very size of the Republican victory provides grounds for
optimism. With control in their hands, party leaders such as Senator Bob
Dole risk finding it is their turn to suffer from electors' frustrations in
1996.
Mr Dole claims to want to use his new position as Senate majority leader to
forge coalitions rather than frustrate them. But his own presidential
ambitions - and his more stridently partisan colleagues - may prevent him
from translating this noble aim into practice.
Thankfully, the medium-term outlook for the economy relies more on Mr Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, than it does on Mr Dole. As
Mr Clinton has discovered, the US economic and political cycles are
currently little correlated. To judge by yesterday's rally in the dollar,
investors believe the Republicans' victory has strengthened Mr Greenspan's
hand in his efforts to keep a lid on inflation.
But the arguments favouring a rise in US interest rates are no stronger  -
or weaker - than they were before the vote.
Important casualties
For the rest of the world, the more important potential casualties of
Congressional gridlock would be in US trade and budgetary policy.
Mr Dole will face a test on the first of these on November 29, when the
'lame-duck' 103rd Congress will finally vote on the ratification of the
treaty agreed in the Uruguay round of the Gatt.
Mr Clinton will doubtless use his upcoming trade talks in Asia and Latin
America to reassure America's trading partners that the country's commitment
to free trade has not been dented by recent events.
But it is up to Mr Dole to ensure that the treaty gets the required number
of Republican votes. Since the 'fast-track procedure' for voting on the
agreement applies only to the current Congress, a failed vote could signify
the death of the treaty altogether.
It would, moreover, be the ultimate signal that the US is set to turn inward
in the coming years.
America first
Republicans co-operated with Mr Clinton to get the Nafta treaty passed in
1993. For all the 'America first-ism' of many a recent Republican campaign,
there must be at least even odds that they will do so with regard to Gatt.
The odds on a serious attempt to reduce the budget deficit over the next two
years must be considerably slimmer.
The Republicans' election manifesto in this area, the 'Contract with
America' published in September, does not bode well. Like many of the
party's past fiscal proposals, it is highly specific on popular policies
like middle-class tax cuts and a balanced budget amendment, but vague, to
say the least, on how the one is to be combined with the other.
President Clinton shares the ambition for a middle class tax cut.
But he too has shied away from specifying the cuts in entitlement programmes
such as Medicare and Medicaid which would be necessary to pay for such a tax
cut.
The Kerrey Commission on entitlement reform, which will report in December,
will point to the drastic reforms needed, even on current tax rates, to stop
the deficit rising in future. A Congress born of a campaign less steeped in
political opportunism than this one, might - just might - have used the
commission's proposals as a basis for constructive legislation.
It is up to the Republicans to decide whether they can transcend the
negativism which brought them victory.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Desperately seeking solace: President Clinton may find a
crumb of comfort in his party's heavy defeat in the US mid-term elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Believe it or not - and after Tuesday's Massacre of the Democrats, it
requires some stretching of the imagination - there are serious people
arguing that Bill Clinton is potentially in better shape today than since he
became president. More remarkably, some of these people are Republicans,
whose joy at their victories in the mid-term elections should be unalloyed.
They draw on the lesson of 1948, when President Harry Truman, saddled with a
Republican landslide two years earlier, won re-election by campaigning
against the 'do-nothing Congress'.
The contemporary analogy was provided by a senior member of the Reagan
administration on polling night: 'If the Republicans were to lead the
majorities (in Congress) the way they've led the minorities, they would be
in trouble. They'd give Clinton a target to run against in 1996 - and though
he might not be a skilled chief executive, he sure is a skilled politician.
And it is not as if they speak with one voice.'
On Tuesday night, even Newt Gingrich, the slash-and - burn conservative
Republican from Georgia who stands to be the next Speaker of the House,
sounded for the first time a little awed by what lay ahead, promising
co-operation rather than confrontation with the White House. He went so far
as to speak relatively kindly of his fellow Republican Robert Dole, majority
leader in the next Senate who is only occasionally an ideological bedfellow.
The Republican sweep was impressive, with control of the House for the first
time in 40 years, of the Senate for the first time in eight, and with at
least eight Democratic governors evicted.
Oliver North and Michael Huffington, poster boys of the alienated hard
right, lost in Virginia and California and Ted Kennedy won in Massachusetts.
But otherwise the cull of famous Democrats was large: Mario Cuomo in New
York and Ann Richards in Texas among the governors; Jim Sasser, who might
have been the next party leader in the Senate, in Tennessee; Congressmen Dan
Rostenkowski in Chicago and Jack Brooks in Texas, past and present chairmen
of the ways and means and judiciary committees with 78 years in the House
between them.
The biggest scalp of all - of Speaker Tom Foley in the state of Washington -
was left hanging from the belt of Mr George Nethercutt, a Republican lawyer
and political novice.
Almost all the voter tunes were sung from the Republican hymnbook. The
promise of less government and lower taxes helped George Pataki beat Mario
Cuomo. Referenda on tax-cutting and limiting the terms of elected officials
were passed almost everywhere they were on the ballot.
Most Democrats were out-toughed on the crime issue, with Governor Lawton
Chiles's survival in Florida over Mr Jeb Bush a rare exception and Mr
Cuomo's defeat the classic proof. Conservative hostility to illegal
immigration was endorsed comfortably in California. The right-wing Christian
lobby failed to return Oliver North, but did well elsewhere. The gun lobby
was instrumental in knocking off Mr Brooks in Texas, accusing him of
apostasy on gun control.
A constant national strain, most virulent in the south and its borders, was
distrust and a dislike akin to hatred of Mr Clinton himself. Democrats lost
in all the states to which the president had devoted his energies in the
last week of campaigning - Minnesota, Delaware, Michigan, Pennsylvania and
Ohio. Mr Gingrich, it appears, made the right strategic decision in turning
the mid-term elections into a plebiscite on the presidency.
But the US still must be governed in the next two years and this is where
Republican elation is tempered among its more thoughtful members. The
party's 'contract with America', effectively its election manifesto, lays
out a plan and a 100-day timetable for introducing legislation, but its
passage in anything approximating the proposed form may be doubted.
One reason for doubt is resistance to it by moderate Republicans in the
Senate (Mr Dole, for one, is still sitting on the fence over term limits).
Another is that Mr Clinton possesses a veto and the Democrats enough
numbers, if they stick together, to block legislation in the Senate by
filibusters, much as the Republicans did in the last session.
Not all will be legislative gridlock revisited. The Republican party's
contract demands that the president be given a 'line item' budget veto,
empowering him to strike out an offending item of spending without throwing
out a whole bill. Mr Clinton has no problem with this, since he advocated it
in 1992.
Nor will he resist the middle class tax cut demanded by Republicans. This is
already in the White House planning stages, though funding it without
increasing the federal deficit is another matter.
Welfare reform is a subject on which both parties agree in principle,
differing only in detail. Modest healthcare reform initiatives cannot be
excluded.
But battles royal can be expected on many other fields - on the proposed
amendment to the constitution requiring a balanced budget, for example, and
on Republican desires to beef up defence spending. The thorniest problem
will be the cutting of federal 'entitlement' programmes such as social
security and medicare, where the Republican contract promised 'gain without
pain'.
The conduct of foreign policy, and its economic and trade components, will
not be any easier, especially if Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the
ultimate arch-conservative, exercises his option to chair the foreign
relations committee (he has the choice of agriculture). The new 'America
First' Republican majority in the House features few conventional
internationalists and sentiment against US military excursions overseas or
involvement in Bosnia, Rwanda and other distant hotspots has increased on
the right, complementing its presence on the left.
Just as serious is the weakening of the old Republican free trade
constituency that helped pass the North American Free Trade Agreement last
year. If the lame-duck Congress does not approve the legislation to
implement the Gatt Uruguay Round in three weeks - and it will do so only if
enough retiring members vote with their consciences and defy an electorate
to which they are no longer subject - its prospects in 1995 look bleak.
Other trade initiatives in Asia and South America, both with summits in the
next five weeks, could be still-born unless what are perceived as American
interests are aggressively protected.
Even if the political will to co-operate proves stronger than expected,
mutual animus is certain to increase because the Republicans will use their
majorities to make a meal out of Whitewater. The tangled skein of the first
family's investments long ago in Arkansas has been off the political screen
for the last few months while the special counsel, Mr Ken Starr, goes about
his work. But the hiatus will not last.
Mr Gingrich has already promised a wholesale investigation of 'White House
corruption'. But even his zeal is likely to pale in comparison with that of
Senator Al D'Amato from New York. He is expected to turn his chairmanship of
the banking committee into a standing inquisition not only into Whitewater
but also into the president's private life and the suicide in the summer of
1993 of Vince Foster, the close Clinton friend and deputy White House legal
counsel.
Having helped dispose of Mr Cuomo, the senator's notorious appetite for
blood has been whetted. He is likely to find an ally in Congressman Jim
Leach of Iowa, another leading Whitewater critic, who stands to inherit the
House banking committee from Henry Gonzalez, the president's staunchest
protector. Both panels, it must be assumed, will leak like sieves and
arrange for televised hearings with maximum exposure.
Further complicating the immediate future is the polarisation of both
parties, if anything more acute among Republicans than Democrats. The House
may prove monolithic under Mr Gingrich, but there is an influential fistful
of Senate moderates - including Bill Cohen of Maine, Nancy Kassebaum of
Kansas, Bob Packwood and Mark Hatfield of Oregon, John Chafee of Rhode
Island and James Jeffords of Vermont - with committee seniority and a
preference for pragmatic over conviction politics.
It also matters that the country is about to enter another election cycle -
for the presidency in 1996. Unless there is some awful Whitewater
development that sinks public confidence in him irrevocably, Mr Clinton
still looks the likely Democratic candidate. If not him, it will be
Vice-President Al Gore, bruised though he was on Tuesday by the Republican
sweep in his native Tennessee. A challenge cannot be ruled out, either from
the left or from the grumpy middle represented in 1992 by Paul Tsongas. But
at present it appears unlikely to succeed.
The Republicans, however, are no closer to finding candidates for 1996 than
they were before the mid-term elections. All the leading suspects are still
around, but Senator Dole will be pre-occupied with congressional management
and Mr Gingrich has no known presidential ambitions. Senator Phil Gramm of
Texas did his cause good by campaigning mightily for Republican candidates
and has assembled a substantial war-chest, but his manner turns as many
people off as on.
Lamar Alexander, former cabinet member and governor of Tennessee, has been
diligently cultivating the grassroots, as have Dick Cheney, ex-secretary of
defence, and James Baker, ex-secretary of everything. The bids, more likely
for the vice-presidential slot, from three governors returned on Tuesday -
Pete Wilson in California, Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin and William Weld in
Massachusetts - have gained in value, while the stock of Christie Whitman of
New Jersey remains high.
However, the ideological differences between the above personalities could
burst at the seams the 'big tent' that the party professes to represent. And
some proto-candidates may find it easier to get elected to the White House
than win the Republican nomination. One who surely cannot win the nomination
because of rightwing opposition but has already put down a marker for the
moderates by declaring is Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
With the main parties divided or listless and distrusted, an independent
candidacy in 1996 remains on the cards. Ross Perot can boast that his
endorsements, generally of Republicans, worked (though not at home in Texas
with the defeat of Ann Richards).
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a nominal Republican who endorsed Mr
Cuomo, would have looked better as an independent prospect in 1996 if the
governor had won. Now he may be forced into his destiny by taking on his
long-term foe Senator D'Amato in the 1998 Senate race. The political right
remains the more fertile ground for independents and libertarians and, as in
1992, that is also not necessarily bad news for Mr Clinton because it will
divide the Republican vote.
However, the president cannot afford to to sit back and wait. To sacrifice
the initiative to the Republican Congress over the next two years would be
good for neither his government nor his own political future. He could
choose to go veto-crazy, but George Bush's exercise of that power did him no
good at all.
Thus the White House watchwords of the moment are of 'repositioning' or
'relaunching' the presidency. With the economy still in reasonable shape and
with foreign policy suddenly fruitful (Haiti, North Korea, the Middle East,
Russia, if not Bosnia), Mr Clinton is not without fertile prospects. No less
than five foreign trips are on his schedule for next year. If the country,
in its isolationist mode, ignores external policy it is a fair bet that Mr
Clinton will return to some of the domestic themes that propelled him into
office in 1992 - emphasis on personal and community responsibility,
tolerance in race relations, for example.
But sooner or later, and all of yesterday's protestations of co-operation
notwithstanding, Mr Clinton will surely round on the Republicans running
Congress and their record in exercising the power to which they have long
been unaccustomed. And that is why some serious Republicans are worried by
Tuesday's results.
For the overriding lesson of the congressional mid-term elections, as it was
to a degree in 1992, is that it is far easier to run against somebody or
something than for both. Ask the ghost of Harry Truman.

As a child, I was taken regularly around Christmas time to see the play of
Peter Pan, which was a wonderful afternoon of escapism for us all.
Of how much more it had to offer I have only now been made aware. The hook
of the pirate captain was a phallic symbol, says Jackie Wullschlager (Arts:
'The truth behind Wonderland', October 31). No mention is made of the Red
Indians, but they each had a tomahawk, did they not? Later, I was taken to
see Treasure Island, which I equally enjoyed, completely missing, I suppose,
the significance of Long John Silver's wooden leg.
Once one catches on to the idea, one's horizons are limitless. Contemplate
the skyline of any modern city; the mind boggles at Canary Wharf]

FT  10 NOV 94 / Struggle at the airport gates: The row over state aid for
airlines ahead of the complete opening of Europe's skies in 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's airline barons are putting up a fight. The loss-making flag
carriers, and the states that own them, are proving as determined to protect
themselves from market forces as the European Commission is to unravel the
closed and subsidised airline industry.
The result is a game of ploy and counterploy, as governments try to delay
the introduction of competition and extend the life and amount of state
subsidies, ahead of the complete opening of European skies in 1997.
The Commission launched its three-stage liberalisation policy in 1986,
forcing European governments to abandon the heavy regulation that had
protected their carriers from competition, but kept many air fares
artificially high.
When deregulation is completed in three years time, all EU airlines will be
able to fly wherever they choose within the single European market, and
operate internal services in other EU countries. The Commission is also
proposing to break up the ground handling monopolies at many European
airports.
For the Commission, the challenge has been to resist pressure from
governments to approve large subsidies for ailing national carriers to help
them cope with liberalisation. The Commission agreed this year that
financially troubled flag carriers should be allowed one last injection of
state funds only where it was tied to a meaningful restructuring programme.
But Brussels since appears to have capitulated to the big state carriers and
their government owners. In July alone, the Commission approved state aid
totalling Dollars 7.1bn to three airlines including Air France, TAP of
Portugal and Olympic Airways of Greece. These aids were equivalent to 45 per
cent of the total losses of Dollars 15.6bn that western airlines have
accumulated on their international scheduled services in the past four
years.
Seven airlines - British Airways, KLM, SAS, Air UK, Maersk, TAT and British
Midland - and the British government are now contesting the Commission's
approval of a FFr20bn state aid package for Air France. The subsidy is
'grotesque', says Sir Michael Bishop, the British Midland chairman. 'It is
almost equal to the entire losses made by world airlines last year'.
But subsidies are not the only source of friction. There has been a bush war
in France over the opening to competition of Orly airport, south of Paris.
The French transport ministry, last month, limited the total number of
take-offs and landings from the airport, which is a stronghold of Air France
and its domestic partner airline, Air Inter, to the current level of 200,000
flights a year, on environmental grounds. Many in the industry suspected the
motive was to prevent any rapid expansion of competition at Orly.
The European Court of Justice recently ordered the French government to
allow other airlines immediate access to the lucrative domestic routes to
Toulouse and Marseilles that have long been the monopoly of Air Inter. The
transport ministry responded by announcing that competing services could
only start in January.
In June, the French government was forced to grant rights to British Airways
and its French affiliate, TAT, to start flying between Orly and London. This
dispute almost blew up into an all-out confrontation with the British
government and the European Commission. And even after reluctantly agreeing
to the Orly flights to London, the French government imposed a cap of four
daily services on the route.
Undeterred by these setbacks, the government this month frustrated KLM's
plans to start services between Amsterdam and Orly by refusing to grant the
Dutch carrier landing rights, prompting KLM to ask the European Commission
to intervene.
The French transport ministry says its aim is to achieve fair and healthy
competition, but concedes that competition on these routes would cut Air
Inter's market share and aggravate losses at the airline.
Last month, Air Inter warned of expected losses of about FFr100m this year.
Its partner, Air France, is engaged in a restructuring plan to cut losses of
FFr8.5bn last year and return the group to profit by 1997.
'The problem is not technical, but political, in the sense that every French
minister of transport has for so long considered himself the minister of Air
France,' said Mr Lofti Belhassine, president of the small French independent
carrier Air Liberte. 'The French government has no right to impose
additional hardship on its citizens by avoiding competition, which is here
to stay. There is still a feudal system in France, but the writing is now on
the wall.'
The stakes are high not just for Air France and other state-owned carriers,
but also for the European Commission and its efforts to liberalise European
air transport.
There has been a rush of alliances and partnerships between large and small
carriers in Europe to strengthen their hand in a deregulated market. But
many governments are proving reluctant to give up sovereignty over their
airspace while they are funding inefficient national carriers, which are
important sources of employment and political patronage.
In addition, government subsidies to European national carriers are running
at Dollars 10m a day, according to Mr Herman De Croo, chairman of the
European Commission's independent committee of 'wise men'. Set up last year,
the committee's brief is to draw up recommendations on the future of the
European airline industry. 'The tragedy of it all is that when the economy
is improving, air transport is on the upswing, and most big airlines are
finally making money, a hard core of state-owned majors appear unable to
take any medicine at all,' notes Mr De Croo.
The danger is that a two-class airline industry will emerge in Europe. 'The
first involves airlines which have had to solve their problems on their own:
the second includes airlines which continue to defy the laws of economics
and have enjoyed a bumper year for subsidies,' says Mr Robert Ayling,
managing director of British Airways. For the BA executive, state aid is a
test that the Commission has so far 'dramatically failed and done lasting
damage to its reputation'.
A Cranfield University study on airline efficiency confirms that privately
or partially privately owned carriers are performing best in Europe while
state-owned carriers are at the bottom of the league. In his legal challenge
against the Air France subsidy, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the UK transport
secretary, emphasised that government handouts removed the incentive for
state-owned airlines to become efficient and adopt a sound commercial
approach.
Even if the European Court action does not succeed in overturning the
Commission's approval of the Air France subsidy, it has unsettled the
regulators. 'If nothing else, this legal challenge is likely to stiffen the
Commission's spine and toughen its attitude over future applications for
state aid,' one Brussels official said.
The consumer is also emerging as a force for change in European air travel.
'We used to think that liberalisation would create the environment to
change,' said one airline executive . 'We now believe the customer will. The
customer has less loyalty to flag-carriers than governments have.'
And despite the last ditch resistance from the barons, the industry does
seem, finally, to be getting the message. As Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the
director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), told
last week's annual meeting of the 222 member airline trade organisation:
'The need for profitability is paramount. Without it air transport will
either die, as did maritime passenger transport, or become a political
football in a game of subsidies, as with the railways.'

Sir, An otherwise excellent article on employee relations in BT (Management:
'Bad connections at BT', November 7) was marred by suggestions that 'the
dispute over flexible working was resolved in a private chat between
(Michael) Hepher (BT's managing director) and Tony Young, leader of the
NCU'.
If I, as general secretary, 'resolved' the issue with a private chat, what
on earth was the executive council doing at its meetings on September 15 and
September 20 (the latter continuing until three o'clock in the morning)?
It was debating the resolution of a major industrial issue, which would
otherwise have led to massive disruption of BT's operation. My job was to
ensure that the executive was able to come to a fully informed decision.
Further, it was able to do this in the most democratic way, and in the most
open of forums. This is how trade unions come to decisions; not over cosy
chats.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quest for monetary credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL P MCLAUGHLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Bank of England appears to have greater weight in the setting of
interest rates, a change designed to enhance the 'credibility' of monetary
policy in the UK ('Bank reports improved outlook on inflation', November 2).
The search for 'credibility' also extends to the idea of a 'pre-emptive'
rate rise, designed to tighten policy at an early stage in the inflation
cycle.
Ultimately, the success of the new policy regime will be judged by the path
of inflation over the next few years, but one can also form an immediate
impression by examining any change to inflation expectations wrought by the
regime shift.
Fortunately, a good proxy for expectations of future UK inflation is at
hand, in the yield difference between nominal bond yields and the real yield
as paid on index-linked stocks.
Unfortunately, the evidence to date suggests the market has yet to be
convinced that inflation is well and truly under control. The inflation rate
implied by the current yield spread between index-linked and nominal bond
yields is some 4.65 per cent, against 3.50 per cent in January. Moreover,
this implied expectation is no different now from what it was on September
12 (the date of the first 'pre-emptive' tightening).
Perhaps most worrisome of all for the Bank of England is that the level of
inflation expectations is virtually twice that of its own forecast of 2.5
per cent. Presumably, true 'credibility' will have been achieved when the
two forecasts coincide, ideally with the market expectation falling to meet
that of the Bank.

Sir, James Morgan got it all wrong in his article about presidents and
cardinals ('All the president's cardinals', November 5). It was precisely
Martin Luther who emphasised the importance of belief, not works. He had
observed how 'good works' were done by many people just to earn themselves a
little throne in heaven, not in order to help others, and he detested the
then fashion to pay others to do the 'good' works for you in order to
achieve that aim. All that really mattered was believing in Christ's word -
all the rest would follow.
To start from the wrong historical premises would make one have grave doubts
about the conclusions in the article . . . Oh, Financial Times, stick to
your finances]

FT  10 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mixed message of share option trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alistair Ross-Goobey (Book Review: 'Why pay should be linked to
success', November 3) writes that there is no place for conventional share
options in executive reward.
The truth of Mr Ross-Goobey's comment is widely recognised among larger
companies and an increasing number of them are abandoning conventional share
options in favour of restricted share plans for their most senior
executives.
Many, however, are retaining share options for second tier management and
some are using both share options and restricted share plans for senior
executives.
There is a mixed message here. If share options are no longer appropriate
for senior executives, why are companies retaining them for lower levels of
management?
For the future, I believe more companies will push down the restricted share
concept to lower levels of management. Indeed, pioneering companies are
already looking at phantom restricted stock plans and even phantom
management buy-outs at the business unit level. (A phantom plan is one where
the cash reward is designed to replicate the actual share price.)
It is almost a truism to say that the only thing that really motivates is
ownership - the challenge is to create a structure which encourages managers
to act like owners while not leading to internal divisions within business
organisations.
At present, there is often too much fog between the efforts employees put in
and the rewards that are generated under their equity-based incentive plans.
Winning companies will find successful formulae to dispel the fog and to
encourage clarity of vision.

<TEXT>
THE TRAP By James Goldsmith Macmillan, Pounds 7.99, 214 pages
The world is seeing a new breed of pluto-populist. Men of vast wealth don
the mantle of outsiders struggling no-bly on behalf of the little people. In
the US, there is Ross Perot. In Italy, there is Silvio Berlusconi. Now there
is the Anglo-French Sir James Goldsmith, recently elected to the European
parliament on an anti-Maastricht and anti-Gatt platform.
Sir James is not just a talented businessman who has accumulated a fortune.
He sees himself as a philosopher. 'Global free trade, intensive agriculture
and nuclear energy' are, along with the modern welfare state and Maastricht
Europe, the main targets of his assault. This unholy trinity has 'profoundly
destroyed our social stability'. They are also 'pure products of the
enlightenment and as such are venerated by modern conventional wisdom', the
latter synonymous, for Sir James, with error.
The book takes the form of conversations with Yves Messarovitch, editor of
the economics section of Le Figaro newspaper. Messarovitch asks bland
questions. In return, Sir James pours forth a torrent of opinions. He is
against the Gatt, intensive agriculture, nuclear power, the universal
welfare state, the Maastricht treaty, the technocratic 'nomenklatura' that
runs Europe, science 'separated from the ethical and the spiritual', and the
enlightenment.
He is in favour of 'families, communities, cultures and traditions';
regional free trade among countries that 'are reasonably similar in terms of
development and wage structures', with 'mutually beneficial' bilateral
agreements between them; a Europe of nations; a common (but not single)
European currency; a social safety net; and participatory democracy.
It is tempting to dismiss all this as the vapours of a self-publicising
crank. That would be a mistake. These views matter: first, because they
articulate a perfectly understandable dismay at the modern world; second,
because a bit of what he says makes sense; third, because he also offers
dangerous solutions that may attract an army of adherents; and, finally,
because he has the means to ensure his ideas will not go away.
Take his assault on free trade. Sir James argues that 'the damage (Gatt)
will inflict on the communities of both the developed world and the third
world will be intolerable'. For the former, the peril is mass unemployment
as '4bn people enter the same world market for labour and offer their work
at a fraction of the price paid to people in the developed world'. But, he
argues, 'the application of Gatt will also cause a great tragedy in the
third world'.
Yet the main cause of unemployment in industrial countries is not trade with
the developing ones. Such trade has merely added something - there is no
agreement how much - to the pressures created by technology upon a rigid
labour market. It is also untrue that labour costs are decisive in
determining competitiveness. Differences in labour costs reflect differences
in average productivity between countries. Nor are these differences
surprising: investment per person in Germany, for example, is 25 times as
large as in China, which is why Chinese labour is cheap.
Protection, even of labour-intensive manufacturing, is a grotesquely
inefficient means of promoting employment. What is too rarely understood -
it is not by Sir James - is that a tax on imports also taxes exports.
Import-competing industry would expand, but export industry would shrink.
Even in import-competing industry, labour-replacing investment would
continue and the tendency towards a steady decline in the jobs supplied by
manufacturing would in no way abate. This depends on the growth in demand
for manufactures, on the one hand, and productivity increases, on the other.
Above all, if we are concerned about unemployment and the distribution of
the gains from growth, the best and most politically honest policy is
direct, rather than indirect, assistance to the workers. The combination of
greatly improved education and training, generous employment subsidies and
income transfers is both the best and the right policy. It is superior to
protection, except politically.
More surprising than arguments for protection in industrial countries is the
view that free trade threatens the third world, too. 'It is the elites who
are in favour of global free trade. It is they who will be enriched,'
asserts Sir James. So the industrial countries can pull up the drawbridge
against third world exports in the comfortable knowledge that it is,
thereby, doing the poor good.
Countries all over the former third world have become more liberal and more
outward-looking in their trade policies. The obvious question is why. The
answer is that they have tried the very policies recommended by Sir James,
with disastrous results. The only path of development that has worked has
been specialisation on the basis of comparative advantage, particularly when
that advantage is in labour-intensive manufactures.
The industrial world has not, as Sir James insists, imposed its model on a
reluctant third world full of happy peasants. Nothing stops a country from
closing itself off: China tried; Burma is still trying. The reason these
attempts have failed is that the vast majority of men and women want the
prosperity the west offers. In fact, they want a tiny fraction of what Sir
James already has.
Sir James alleges westerners believe 'any community which resists the
absorption or destruction of its culture by the west is a threat to peace'.
I, for one, do not. What is indeed a threat to peace is the view that the
industrial countries are entitled to deprive billions of people around the
world of the mutually beneficial trade that is their best hope for some
prosperity.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Arts: Rostropovich plays Shchedrin - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday, thanks to a London Symphony commission made possible by Sir Jack
and Lady Lyons, we heard Mstislav Rostropovich at the Barbican, London, in
the world premiere of a cello concerto, a 'Sotto voce concerto'. The
composer Rodion Shchedrin, now 62, is (slightly) known in this country for
his ballet The Little Humpbacked Horse and for his ballet-adaptation of
Carmen - not sotto voce music at all. His new concerto has been brewed in
quite a different samovar.
It is whispery, nostalgic, evocative; and highly personal, in the double
sense of intimating things close to the composer's heart, and of being
specifically conceived for Rostropovich's rare powers. The solo instrument
is rarely silent, but mostly muted, even in the huge cadenza that leads to
the Finale. The full orchestra is used very sparingly; the most prominent
sounds are those of three soft, intertwined flutes - and of all the other
cellos, generally divisi.
A solo recorder lends a pastoral note, for Shchedrin is thinking of his
childhood in 'the sleepy tiny little place of Alexin on the Oka', in Tolstoy
country. Most of the material suggests shepherds' songs and peasant rounds,
mused and rhapsodised over by the cello with spectral orchestral echoes.
Toward the end, quite unexpectedly, the heavy brass come to angry life with
rat-a-tat fanfares: war gripping the countryside, perhaps?
Rostropovich wrung 'meaning' from every phrase, of course, and we listened
compulsively. But despite the best efforts of the conductor Seiji Ozawa, the
score sounded awkwardly diffuse for a 37-minute piece: amid so many elusive
sounds and colours, we needed more palpable structure, less stop-go.
Probably Russian ears can fasten more quickly on ghosts of traditional
tunes, and maybe discern a development that remained opaque to the rest of
us.
As a matter of fact the largest faction in the audience was Japanese, drawn
presumably by Ozawa. He conducted a scrupulous Beethoven 'Pastoral' too,
tame in the peasants' Scherzo but limpid by the stream: pleasant,
unmemorable.

THREE COLOURS RED (15) Krzysztof Kieslowski
DREAM LOVER (18)Nicholas Kazan
SLEEP WITH ME (18) Rory Kelly
FLESH AND BONE (15) Steve Kloves
IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU (PG) Andrew Bergman
Is the crusty retired judge (Jean-Louis Trintignant) at the centre of
Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours Red really a portrait of the director?
Kieslowski is now a crusty retired film-maker. Before unwrapping this
farewell movie at Cannes last May, he announced that he was going into a
life of chain-smoking leisure and contemplation. Like Judge Trintignant, he
realises that truth is a desperate thing to keep chasing; and that curiosity
about human beings is not necessarily an honest virtue, just as often it may
be, or may become, a sleazy addiction.
Trintignant, deep in the book-lined villa where the film's
student/fashion-model heroine (Irene Jacob) first finds him, after she has
injured his Alsatian dog in a car collision, spends his days tapping into
neighbours' phone calls. Like a movie-maker he flirts with omniscience. He
knows of the next-door husband's guilt: 'Sooner or later he'll jump out of a
window and his wife will know everything.' He knows too about the blonde
girl who is two-timing her young lawyer boyfriend, who happens to live near
Jacob herself.
A few scenes later, prompted by our heroine's virtuous indignation, Judge
Trintignant reveals his crimes to the cops and the newspapers. Enough with
the hi-tech voyeurism, he seems to say. And is Kieslowski saying the same?
Three Colours Red rounds off the Polish film-maker's tricouleur trilogy with
this essay on fraternity. The movie, like the Judge, often seems tired. Many
of the metaphysical Kieslowski twitchings were displayed to better effect in
Blue.
This goes for the obsession with parallel lives. Is Mlle Jacob's young
lawyer neighbour mystically re-living Trintignant's life, right down to
exact, reverberant incidents like the dropping of a pile of exam books in
the street? It also goes for the director's fondness for deus ex machina
wrap-ups. In Red we have a hideously glib ending in which a cross-channel
ferry is sacrificed to bad weather so that six people can survive to reveal
themselves as - yes] - the key young characters from all three trilogy
movies. This includes the young lawyer, at last hurled by Fate into Jacob's
arms.
Red begins as a movie about communication between people and generations.
The opening sequence is a dazzler: camera snaking at high speed along phone
cables as they plunge through earth and then under the sea. And thereafter
the film's title colour is picked out in each scene, warmly, brilliantly,
like a electronic beacon between strangers and ages.
But midway through the film we start to get an empty, hungry feeling. Surely
Kieslowski and regular co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz have forgotten
something vital: to put real people into this story. Where past heroines -
Juliette Binoche in Blue, Irene Jacob in The Double Life Of Veronique - were
tortured, touching souls grappling with the tragicomedy of everyday life, no
one in Red lives and breathes except as illustrations to a thesis. That
thesis is: Everything, for good and ill, connects.
Trintignant's Judge is the sacred and profane side of our Neighbourhood
Watch epoch: satanic, he snoops; God-like, he can confer happy endings.
Jacob's leggy, open-hearted model is a sort of Miss Perfect Human Communion
1994. And the setting is Geneva, world capital of brokered harmony. In the
Kieslowski cannon the jagged realities and loose nerve-ends of Blue, and the
song-without-end mysticism of Veronique, have been put away for this too,
too neat last testament. Red shows that even lives that do not naturally
connect can be forced into harmony by a little hi-tech hot-wiring mixed with
supernatural benison.
But every film industry likes to compel human unions when it cannot
germinate them naturally. Each film this week is a variant on that oldest
coercive formula of all: Boy Meets Girl.
Nicholas Kazan's Dream Lover is a directing debut by the screenwriter of
Patty Hearst and Reversal Of Fortune. So we expect a few frissons amid the
amatory fol-de-rol. Boy (James Spader) meets girl (Madchen Amick); then boy
starts to wish he had not met girl when Amick shows signs of deceit,
infidelity and a hidden past. Boy ends up in a mental asylum hatching murder
plots.
While ambiguity thrives, the film has a wicked wit. Kazan lets Spader get
ever more lost amid the chic white spaces of his home and office - he is an
architect (but, ah irony, not of his own destiny) - while Amick's
dream-bride beauty becomes ever more sinisterly blanched and iconic. For 80
of its 103 minutes, we are guessing, fretting and chewing the nearest set of
fingernails. But the ending is a disaster: a surrender to thriller cliche
that should be stamped like a black spot on Kazan's directing CV, to warn
future employers.
In Rory Kelly's Sleep With Me, boy (Eric Stoltz) meets girl (Meg Tilly); boy
marries girl; boy then discovers that second boy (Craig Sheffer), his
longtime friend, has raging passion for girl. We move into a Jules and Jim
syndrome, California-style, in which kooky triangular fun alternates with
moments of semi-murderous intent.
Six scriptwriters, including Neal Jimenez (River's Edge) and Roger Heddon
(Bodies, Rest And Motion), each worked at different story sections: which
explains why the film feels like a game of consequences played out by the
students of a creative writing class. Some innocent-seeming scenes are sharp
as a paper's edge. Others, notably the rambling 'confessions' to video
camera during a long barbecue sequence, are as blunt as yesterday's writing
ideas that you balled up and threw into the WPB.
Do watch, though, for a funny cameo by Quentin Tarantino as a party guest
deconstructing Top Gun as a gay fable.
As for Flesh And Bone, what ever high-concept story conference produced
this? Boy (Dennis Quaid) meets girl (Meg Ryan). Boy, we learn, is the
grown-up ex-accomplice of a violent burglar father (James Caan) who shot to
death the girl's family when she was a baby. So the stage is set - or the
flat, moody, infinite Texas landscape - for a flat, moody, infinite film.
The slow incubation of revenge shares screen time with the grimly inert
'lerve' story at the centre.
It feels like a bad O'Neill play staged by a community theatre company: one
of those outdoor productions where the audience has to keep moving its
chairs around. Now we are watching everyday small-town life as it is clumped
through by Quaid, a man of few words and none of them interesting. Now we
are out in the cornfields with Ryan, wondering why the talented star of
Sleepless In Seattle took on this rewardless, one-note role. Ah, yes; of
course. She is married to Quaid.
Dynastic connections are important in Hollywood. It Could Happen To You is a
romantic comedy starring Nicolas Cage, nephew of Francis Coppola, and
Bridget Fonda, daughter of Peter, and directed by Andrew Bergman, son of
Ingmar: if only.
Ingmar should have taken over this film and given it teeth and mania. Boy
(policeman) meets girl (waitress). Boy, in lieu of tip, promises girl half
whatever he wins on a lottery ticket. Boy wins lottery. Boy wins girl. Boy's
wife (Rosie Perez) promptly goes berserk, which provides the only comedy in
a film so thick with anodyne, lolloping romance that by the end we are
crying out for one of those murders so generously on offer in the week's
other movies.

The large sculpted horse that is the only prop in Rina Yerushalmi's

Romeo and Juliet meet on him, act out the balcony scene on him, and cling to
him desperately as things go wrong. It is a simple device, yet a
surprisingly eloquent one, and typical of this beguiling production from Tel
Aviv.
This, the second Romeo and Juliet in the Everybody's Shakespeare season at
the Barbican, is very different from the stark German production that
launched the festival last week. Where the German production on the main
stage was long and large scale, the Israeli one, staged in the Pit, is
intimate and condensed; where that production focused on the confrontation
in the play at the expense of the romance, this one emphasises the theme of
love, at some cost to the violence; and where the first one created a bleak
and harsh world, the second is soft, beautiful and sometimes bewildering.
The mood of the piece even seeps out into the foyer. As the audience collect
their tickets, a pair of masked lovers wander among them, looking rather
lost. Inside, half-masked actors in black cloaks pad about the auditorium,
smiling tantalisingly at the audience and addressing them, somewhat
mystifyingly, in Hebrew. Soft music and subtle lighting suffuse the theatre
in the languorous atmosphere that will permeate the production.
Yerushalmi's intent, as she explains in the programme, is to use the
language of theatre to capture the intoxicating feeling of being in love.
She builds to some extent on commedia dell'arte, which helps to establish
the mischievous, inventive mood of her production. The actors, dressed as a
group of strolling players, are inspired by the Chorus to perform the play
and act out the opening brawl in playful spirit. As they and the audience
are sucked into the story, however, the mood changes.
Once Romeo and Juliet have met, the play is compressed to the main moments.
The central Romeo and Juliet remain on stage while other members of the cast
speak their lines or perform their actions. This suggests the engulfing
nature of love and its ability to distort perception. It works wonderfully
in places. As the couple part after their night together, the main Romeo and
Juliet stand wrapped around each other in mute adoration, while another
couple speak their thoughts. And when Juliet visits Friar Laurence for the
potion that will put her to sleep, four actresses creep around the stage in
the flickering light, each totally wrapped up in her task. This may sound
bizarre, but on stage it works, emphasising both the universality and the
loneliness of passion.
There is a price to be paid for this conceit. Sometimes it is confusing,
sometimes it just seems tricksy and throughout it sacrifices the continuity
of character that would help you empathise with Romeo and Juliet and
experience their tragedy. The production also gives little hint of danger -
the fight between Tybalt and Mercutio is a rather stagey affair. But there
are some purely enchanting moments - to portray the ball, for instance, the
actors simply file softly onto the stage carrying sparklers and surround
Juliet in flickering light - and the whole production is performed with such
charm, lilt and gentleness by the Itim Theatre Ensemble that it is hard to
resist.
Continues to November 12 at the Pit (071 638 8891).

The opening edition of Channel 4's great egg race, which is called Beat That
Einstein, did not resist the temptation to talk down to us. Simple
scientific ideas were explained as to a four-year-old, and the presenter
proved willing to do anything - lie in the bath, fall in the sea - to appear
matey. So here is one viewer who will not be watching when today's guinea
pigs attempt to build a tree house and a flying machine (8.00). Last week
Ludovic Kennedy argued a revisionist version of the Lucky Lucan story, this
week it is ITV's turn. The Trial Of Lord Lucan brings the evidence to a
courtroom setting and a 'real' jury tries him (8.30). Dawn French takes the
title role in BBC1's new comedy series The Vicar Of Dibley, thus adding a
new dimension to the 'All Gas And Gaiters' school of comedy which has, so
far, been all-male (8.30). The X-Files carries on a tradition of fantasy
drama for grown up audiences which has always been stronger in North America
than in Britain. Today agents Mulder and Scully investigate scientists who
have been driven to suicide in Alaska (9.00 BBC2).

FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Food for thought -
Neil Buckley explains why it took so long for Marks and Spencer to crack
the international retailing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When women in Madrid and Lisbon want a bra, they head for Marks and Spencer.
The UK-based clothing and food retailer is building a Spanish and Portuguese
retailing empire on selling lingerie. The reason, say M&amp;S managers, is that
local retailers are decades behind in the way they sell these intimate
garments.
Many offer only three sizes of bra - small, medium or large. Products are
displayed in glass cases; buying one requires an assistant reaching up and
taking a box from a shelf behind the counter. Marks and Spencer, by
contrast, sells a wide range of bras, displayed on open fixtures, in 17
sizes. 'We really do lead the world in bras and knickers,' says David
Dewhurst, commercial manager of Marks and Spencer's Portuguese franchise.
Being a successful international retailer, however, means more than
providing 17 bra sizes, as Marks and Spencer has discovered. The history of
its expansion overseas has not always been happy.
In 22 years of trading in Canada it has rarely done better than break even,
with local inhabitants never really taking to its stores. D'Allaird's, the
Canadian chain M&amp;S acquired in the 1970s, has, performed a little better.
More recently, M&amp;S underestimated the work it would have to do to bring
Brooks Brothers, the upmarket US clothing chain acquired in 1987, up to
group standards. Elsewhere, however, across Europe and in east Asia, Marks
and Spencer is at last becoming a successful cross-border operator.
As well as 322 Brooks Brothers, D'Allaird's and Kings Super Markets stores
in North America and Japan, and its 40 M&amp;S stores in Canada, it has 32
company-owned stores in six countries outside the UK, from the Republic of
Ireland to Hong Kong. It also has 76 franchise stores in 18 countries from
Austria to Indonesia. In its most recent full-year results, 13 per cent of
Marks and Spencer's turnover and 7 per cent of operating profits came from
outside the UK.
It used to be a rule of retailing that stores groups that succeeded overseas
were those that 'sold their country', whose image and products were closely
associated with a particular nation.
That no longer holds true. Retailers such as Toys R Us of the US and the
Swedish furniture retailer Ikea dominate every market they enter not because
they are American or Swedish, but because they sell a bigger range of better
products than their competitors, at better prices. The UK's Body Shop has
expanded into 45 countries by selling innovative 'natural' products.
Britishness scarcely comes into it.
What these retailers have in common is a 'unique selling point', setting
them apart from competitors. Marks and Spencer's USP, however, is complex;
customers outside the UK seem drawn to its stores for many different
reasons.
Part of the reason is still its Britishness. Overseas store managers admit
that classic 'British' products, such as Harris tweed jackets or flannel
shirts, always sell well. But, says Juan Jinojosa, a director of Cortefiel,
the Spanish retailer which owns 20 per cent of Marks and Spencer's Spanish
business: 'Early in the life of Marks and Spencer in a new country, its
British appeal is important. But the day quickly comes when the appeal is
more the strength of the product and the service.'
An important reason for customers choosing M&amp;S is that it offers a variety
of other products not available locally, at least in such depth, or for such
a good price. Lingerie is in this category - in Madrid it accounts for
almost a quarter of turnover, compared with 13 to 15 per cent in UK stores.
Sometimes the products are more unusual, especially in food. In Marks and
Spencer's new Paris store, which opened in September on the Rue de Rivoli,
some of the best-selling products are ready meals, especially Indian meals -
not widely available in France.
But perhaps the most important ingredient of Marks and Spencer's overseas
stores is that they are able to meet local tastes and offer products similar
to those in local stores - but at superior quality and prices.
Both internal and external factors have made M&amp;S better able to do this now
than it was when it first expanded overseas in the 1970s. One external
factor is that international tastes have started to converge, due to growth
in foreign travel and cross-border television and media.
Alan Lambert, Marks and Spencer's divisional director for continental
Europe, says the 'European consumer' is now a reality. 'I personally
wouldn't narrow it down to Europe,' he adds. 'There is already an
international consumer.'
Individual tastes do persist in different countries, but internal changes
have helped Marks and Spencer address these. The group has developed the
flexibility to construct a product offer made up of 'core' bestsellers
surrounded by products tailored to local markets.
This does not work everywhere - Canada being the obvious example - and M&amp;S
still makes mistakes, but it has learned to rectify these more quickly.
Dewhurst says research a few years ago in Portugal found shoppers loved
Marks and Spencer's lingerie, but thought its clothing 'ugly'. By swapping
the contemporary bodies and leggings it had been trying to sell for more
'classical' blouses and skirts, it was able to meet local tastes.
With all tills in company-owned stores linked to a giant computer centre in
west London, and franchise operations increasingly being linked to the same
system, the group can quickly pick up trends, spotting which products are
not selling, and make adjustments accordingly. Moreover, all products are
sourced through its central buying organisation and supplier network, which,
says Alan Hodges, Madrid store manager, means M&amp;S can be 'unbeatable value'.
That is in spite of M&amp;S's prices in continental Europe being about 20 per
cent higher than in the UK, owing to higher distribution costs. Prices,
however, are coming down as M&amp;S adopts its 'outstanding value' campaign
across Europe, involving lowering prices on popular products to boost
volumes.
There are perhaps two important lessons to be learned from Marks and
Spencer's experiences. One is the importance of flexibility. Transplanting a
store format and its product range from one country to another, as M&amp;S tried
to do in the 1970s, is not enough, even in the age of today's international
consumer. The complexities of local tastes must be catered for.
But successful cross-border retailing does not necessarily entail
reinventing the wheel, coming up with a highly innovative store format or
concept. In the words of Alan Lambert: 'Quality, service and value will sell
anywhere.'

FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Deutsche Bank's
motley crew - A different kind of corporate advertising by Germany's biggest
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Put together a theologian, a car company executive, a trade unionist, a
former government minister and a couple of professors and what do you have?
A motley collection, some would say, but for Deutsche Bank they have a
common link. To Germany's largest bank, this is a group of people who can
help polish its image after a year of hard knocks.
From Sunday, it will run a series of heavyweight advertisements in German
newspapers where these individuals' views on work and society in an
uncertain future will be comprehensively presented. The bank will scarcely
be mentioned, although its name and line-in-a-box logo will be printed at
the foot of the articles.
Why is the bank doing this? Clearly, an image-burnishing campaign would not
go amiss at the end of a year in which it has featured uncomfortably in the
spotlight. First, its role as shareholder and creditor of
Metallgesellschaft, which made heavy losses on US oil futures trading, was
highlighted. Then came Jurgen Schneider's collapsing property empire, to
which the bank was a significant lender, followed by his disappearance.
Banks in general have been criticised for being too inattentive to
customers' needs.
But the current campaign, masterminded by Abels &amp; Grey, a self-styled
corporate mission agency in Dusseldorf, is not like the usual burst of
promotions. The latest run of advertisements has more to do with broad
social and philosophical issues, although the agency does plan an image
campaign along more usual lines next month.
Such a concept-oriented approach in advertising is novel. Horizont, the
German marketing weekly, says the campaign 'breaks through the accepted
boundaries of institutional communication'. Its theme is Work of the Future
 -the Future of Work; the articles are somewhat daunting two-page reprints
of speeches on the subject by Hans Kung, a controversial Catholic
theologian, Heinz Riesenhuber, former research minister, Wolfgang Reitzle,
BMW's development director, Walter Riester, deputy head of the IG Metall
trade union, and two professors from Constance and Bonn. The speeches were
given at a conference of the Alfred Herrhausen Society, formed in memory of
the bank's former chairman, killed by terrorists five years ago.
This week the bank has run 60-second television commercials foreshadowing
the campaign against a background of job uncertainty. According to Horizont;
'No large German company, and certainly none of the big banks, has dealt
with such social themes in a way that is so public and so removed from its
own business'.
It calls the bank's action 'courageous' but says it also carries a high
risk, especially since each article would be prefaced by the words:
'Deutsche Bank - we support the future.' This would be a yardstick by which
the bank would be measured.
Deutsche Bank accepts this risk. 'We are under the gaze of the public,'
writes Hilmar Kopper, the chairman, in Forum, its house magazine. 'As one of
the leading corporations in Germany, we are quite obviously involved in many
social activities which go beyond the purely commercial.' By this, he means
the bank's responsibilities as an employer and member of the community,
supporting environmental research and helping the disabled.
It is this 'other side' that the bank wants to bring more into the open.
Kopper says Deutsche Bank's 'traditional reticence' about the wider aspect
of its activities had led to 'a certain one-sidedness' in the public's view.
In future, it would provide more information about how it fulfilled its
social responsibilities.
Horizont hopes more companies will follow suit. No doubt, they will await
the response to Deutsche Bank's campaign first.

FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The old school lie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do independent schools improve their market position, as recession
continues to make inroads into pupil numbers? The answer seems to be: by
moving up the league tables.
Parents place increasing weight on exam results with the consequence that
those schools which perform well cite their league position in their
advertising.
At face value, this is a welcome development. If schools are forced to
improve academic results, they are boosting the fundamental quality of their
product. But the suspicion is harboured in some quarters that certain
schools have worked out how to doctor the results.
After the FT's school survey was published last month, a humorous missive
arrived from Uppingham, a Leicestershire boarding school. The Uppingham
Newsletter, tongue in cheek, provided heads with ways to massage their
figures:
Challenge the results with the examiners. 'Obviously you won't want to
include the results in your statistical submission, because they are not
really results at all, are they?'
'Weed out' pupils who do badly in the mock exams. 'Obviously Nigel should
not be allowed to take the A-level. It wouldn't be fair on him.'
Establish a 'private examination entrance centre-St Custard's', and enter
your 20 per cent weakest candidates there: 'St Custard's won't do very well,
but you will]'
Recruit pupils from Germany, for example, and enter them for A-level German.
Omit results for those who have been at the school 'just for a year's
experience - they can't be expected to do terribly well'.
Start at the very beginning and refuse to permit students to take 'hard'
subjects, even if they want to.
The newsletter notes mischievously: 'Nobody would even think of such things,
would they? You'd be surprised]'

Brian Duncan is to step down as chief executive of Irish Life Ireland as
part of the company's reorganisation of its European operations.
Duncan, who joined the company after leaving school, has been in charge of
both retail and corporate arms. His departure follows a merging of the
company's retail business in Ireland and the UK under a new chief executive,
Jean Wood, currently head of Irish Life's European business. Corporate
activities are to be headed by Kevin Murphy, currently in charge of
investments.
Irish Life's managing director David Kingston says Duncan, 49, believes 'it
is now time for a change - both for himself and for Irish Life'.
Duncan declined to take one of the two new positions created by the
management review and is now said to be favourite to take the vacant
position of chief executive of VHI, the big state health insurer.

FT  10 NOV 94 / People: Kermans finally bow out at BS Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A long and bitter boardroom struggle at BS Group, the Bristol-based property
and leisure company, has come to an end after three members of the Kerman
family resigned.
The announcement was the culmination of the efforts of non-family
shareholders to remove the Kermans, who have been associated with BS,
formerly Bristol Scotts, since before the second world war.
In August, Anthony Kerman was deposed as chairman and replaced by Sir Ian
Rankin. Two months later Scotts Holdings, a property group based in
Singapore, bought the Kermans' 26.97 per cent stake in the company for
Pounds 3.1m. This was held by Anthony Kerman, his brother Nicholas and their
father Isidore.
Scotts is quoted on the Singapore stock exchange but is controlled by the
Jumabhoy family, who at the time of the buy-out agreement received
assurances from the Kermans that they would leave the board.
Iqbal Jumabhoy, Rafik Jumabhoy and Bryan Burletson, a business partner of
the Jumabhoys, have taken three seats on the board as non- executive
directors. Sir Ian remains chairman.
