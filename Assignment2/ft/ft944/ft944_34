FT  08 NOV 94 / Policy rift tests Polish coalition: Partners' differences
emerge over speed of privatisation programme

<TEXT>
Differences over privatisation policies are threatening to undermine
Poland's governing coalition, which is made up of the former communist Left
Democratic Alliance (SLD) and the Polish Peasant party (PSL), led by Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister, who begins a two-day visit to London today.
The row centres on Mr Bogdan Pek, a PSL deputy and the head of the Sejm's
(parliament's) privatisation committee. His SLD colleagues plan to replace
him at a meeting today in a move signalling the need to speed up the
disposal of state enterprises.
The SLD is supported in its drive against Mr Pek by the opposition Freedom
Union (UW), which made up the bulk of the last non-communist,
Solidarity-rooted, government led by Ms Hanna Suchocka. This raises the
prospect of a future switch from the present alliance with the PSL,
unthinkable a year ago when the government came to power. The move also
gives the SLD, which fears the PSL is beginning to dominate the coalition,
the chance to use the threat of political realignment to gain more of a say
over policy.
A meeting of the SLD leadership at the weekend confirmed that the present
coalition, which enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority, should be
maintained but that government policies lacked co-ordination and a clear
strategy. The two parliamentary caucuses are due to meet on November 15 to
thrash out differences.
In a related development, local councillors in Warsaw from the SLD and the
UW have combined to elect Mr Marcin Swiecicki from the UW as the city's
president in the face of opposition from the PSL.
Mr Pek, an accountant from Krakow, has outspokenly criticised the
privatisation policies of former governments and has come to symbolise
opposition to the process as a whole. Indeed, he is against the sale of
sectors such as the tobacco industry, as planned by Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek,
the SLD privatisation minister.
Mr Pek, like Mr Pawlak, is also deeply suspicious of the country's
long-delayed mass privatisation programme. This involves the transfer of 444
state companies to private ownership through 15 or so closed-end investment
funds whose shares are to be distributed to the population at large at a
nominal fee.
Yesterday, Mr Kaczmarek, warned that continuing delays in implementing the
programme meant that 4,000bn zlotys (Pounds 100m) of revenues from the sale
of fund shares, written into next year's budget, could be jeopardised.

Striking workers at Pechiney's huge new aluminium factory at Dunkirk
yesterday ended their 13-day stoppage after management gave them an extra
FFr600 (Pounds 71) a month. Workers at the smelter, which has a capacity of
215,000 tonnes or almost half France's total output, had demanded FFr1,000 a
month on top of their average monthly pay of FFr11,500. During the strike,
managers kept the three-year-old plant's continuous smelting process going,
producing low-grade aluminium which will now be recycled. Partly as a result
of voluntary production cuts agreed by western and Russian aluminium
producers, the market for the metal has greatly improved this year. But
demands for higher pay have also sparked strikes. The number of industrial
disputes in France, though still very low, appears to be rising with the
current improvement in the economy.

The Romanian government yesterday attempted to relaunch its privatisation
programme by opening public offerings for three medium-sized state
companies, the first such offerings for 18 months. The offers are open first
to employees, who will be able to purchase on preferential terms up to 20
per cent of the companies, which are together valued at Lei44.5bn (Pounds
16m). The general public will able to buy up to 30 per cent of the remaining
equity later this month. It will be one of the first times the public can
use privatisation vouchers distributed in 1992 to bid for companies. Only
two companies have been sold by public offer so far under the country's
privatisation scheme. Reformers hope the offers will rekindle the
population's interest in privatisation and lead to pressure on the
government to speed up the process, which has been blocked by conservatives
within the governing Party of Social Democracy.

Turkey's foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, said in a newspaper interview
yesterday that Kurdish could be taught in schools and used in broadcasting.
At present, schools must teach in Turkish and no broadcasting organisation
or newspapers use Kurdish, a language spoken by one fifth of the country's
population of 60m. However, Mr Soysal said he would insist that Turkish was
still taught as a first language.
The separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) has waged a 10-year war that
has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Prime minister Tansu Ciller has adopted
a hardline anti-PKK policy, rejecting calls to grant Kurds cultural rights
and autonomy. Neither Mrs Ciller, on a state visit to Egypt, nor her office
could confirm that Mr Soysal's comments represent a new government
initiative. The unpredictable Mr Soysal, foreign minister since August,
belongs to the junior SHP party in Mrs Ciller's coalition government.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Albanians reject constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albanian voters have overwhelmingly rejected a constitution drafted by
President Sali Berisha which would have further shifted the balance of power
from parliament to the already powerful presidency. Preliminary results
indicate that more than 60 per cent of voters rejected it in a weekend
referendum. The new constitution would have given the president the power to
appoint and dismiss the prime minister, appoint ministers and preside over
the supreme court
Mr Berisha, whose Democratic party won a landslide victory in the 1992
elections, has faced mounting opposition in parliament and within his own
party for his increasingly autocratic style. The outcome of the vote is a
striking confirmation of Albania's conversion to democracy after 45 years of
communist rule.

The worst rainstorms to hit north-western Italy for 80 years have killed 59
people and authorities fear the final death toll could be well over 100.
State television, in a report that spoke of a 'cataclysm' in the northwest
Piedmont region, said 5,000 people were homeless, 1.2m acres of land were
under water and 10 districts still cut off four days after the first rains
fell. Continuing bad weather is hampering rescue work.
Telephones, water, electricity and roads were also cut in hundreds of
villages across southern France, Spain and across the Mediterranean in
Morocco. In France, where seven people have died since the weekend, floods
forced the closure of Nice-Cote d'Azur international airport (whose
inundated car park is pictured below).
Weekend storms in which 60cm of rain fell in as many hours have turned
rivers into raging torrents and demolished houses beneath mountains of mud.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, touring the stricken
north-west, was jeered by angry residents in the flood-hit town of Alba
after hearing bitter criticism from local councillors and businessmen over
the speed of relief work. He is to chair an emergency cabinet meeting this
morning to draw up special measures for Piedmont, where scores of towns and
villages are without power and other utilities.

Nato jets flew over the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, for the third evening in
a row yesterday to halt fighting between Moslems and Serbs that is
threatening the fragile truce in the city.
Heavy mortar and artillery exchanges broke out in the west of the city, near
the airport. A United Nations spokeswoman said, however, that the two sides
had heeded requests to stop firing soon after the fighters flew over.
The fighting came as the conflict threatens to engulf all of Bosnia. The
newly confident Bosnian government army yesterday continued its
two-week-long offensive against Serb forces, which are trying to mount a
counter-attack.
UN political and military officials earlier yesterday expressed differing
views in talks about the fighting. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese diplomat
who heads the UN's 40,000-strong mission in former Yugoslavia, said the
Serbs would probably respond with a counter-attack, but then a military
balance would be reached.
However, British officials said they were unsure whether the increased
fighting would lead to a positive result. They urged all parties to abandon
the idea of a military solution to the Bosnian conflict.
In a further sign of international disunity, British officials disclosed
that they and their French counterparts had launched a discreet diplomatic
campaign to dissuade other members of the UN Security Council from voting
with the US to authorise arms supplies to Bosnia.
In Bosnia, a Serb commander threatened to seize back heavy weapons his army
has placed under UN supervision and deploy them against the Moslem-led
government army if attacks around Sarajevo continue. UN ground forces are
too lightly armed to prevent the Serbs from retaking the equipment. However,
such violations of the total exclusion zone around Sarajevo might prompt
Nato air strikes.
Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces continued their offensive, pouring artillery
fire on to Serb positions near Donji Vakuf, a strategic town in central
Bosnia, yesterday. Bosnian government forces are also trying to take Trnovo,
which could provide a link between Sarajevo and the Moslem enclaves in
eastern Bonsia.
Mr Akashi was speaking in Geneva, where he conferred with Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general, and UN commanders in former Yugoslavia about
the peacekeeping effort. Ronald van de Krol adds from Amsterdam: An
international war crimes tribunal covering the former Yugoslavia opens
formally in The Hague today with a request for the extradition from Germany
of a Bosnian Serb, Mr Dusan Tadic, arrested in Germany last year, who is
alleged to have murdered three Moslem prisoners at the Omarska concentration
camp in Serb-held northwestern Bosnia in 1992.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Swedish leaders plead EU cause: Growing fear of No vote
galvanises the pro-membership camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's senior political leaders yesterday moved to bolster faltering
support for joining the European Union, sounding an anxious chorus of
warnings about the serious economic consequences facing the country if it
rejects membership in a referendum next Sunday.
A series of opinion polls suggesting a swing towards the anti-EU campaign
alarmed Stockholm's financial markets, weakening the krona, knocking more
than 1 per cent off share values on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and pushing
up yields on five-year government bonds to more than 11 per cent. This
further widened the premium paid on Swedish debt compared with most of its
European competitors.
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, his top ministers and opposition
leaders said worse would follow if the outcome on Sunday was a No vote, with
damaging effects on the country's effort to control its big budget deficit
and fast-growing state debt. Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister, said he
would have to add to the SKr51bn (Pounds 4.3bn) package of tax increases and
spending cuts he announced last week.
'With a No, I would be forced to go back to the Riksdag (parliament) this
month with proposals for further financial measures - this is undeniable,'
Mr Persson said.
Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative former prime minister ousted by the Social
Democrats in September's general election, said the prospect of a No vote
was 'deadly serious'. 'The No side now owe citizens an answer on how they
consider the dangerous and damaging interest rate consequences of their
policy would be managed,' he said.
Most of the latest opinion polls have given the No side only a marginal lead
at best. But what has worried the Yes camp is an apparent break in a trend
of growing support for membership which followed the general election.
Pro-EU campaigners, trying to steady their nerves, point out that opinion
polls in Austria also lurched towards the No campaign shortly before the
referendum there on EU membership in June, but the result was a hefty
majority in favour of more than 66 per cent.
The latest polls have galvanised the Yes campaign. With the full weight of
the political and industrial establishment now uniting for a Yes vote - and
many voters still undecided - a Yes is still quite possible.
However, anti-EU feeling has always been far more deeply entrenched in
Sweden than it was in Austria, with all polls in the two years until late
summer showing a lead for the No camp.
A No vote in Sweden, the biggest of the three Nordic applicants, would be a
serious snub to the European Union. It would almost certainly presage a
rejection of membership in Norway, which votes on November 28. That would
leave only Austria and Finland of the four European Free Trade Area
countries which have negotiated entry terms set to come in.
Even in Finland a small doubt has crept in following the postponement on
Sunday of parliamentary ratification of last month's referendum approval
until after Sweden has voted. Finnish EU opponents are hoping that a No vote
in Sweden might win over enough MPs to form the necessary one third minority
needed to block ratification - although most observers doubt their chances.
In Sweden, there is concern among Yes campaigners that they may have
miscalculated their tactics by being too defensive and unfocused, running,
for example, posters proclaiming 'It is more fun to say Yes', or showing
stereotyped citizens of EU countries saying 'Welcome Sweden'.
This allowed the No side, dominated by the left and environmentalists, to
seize the initiative by playing on fears that EU membership would erode the
country's democratic traditions, neutrality and its 'Swedish model' welfare
system.
Mr Bildt and his supporters are critical of Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime
minister, for deliberately adopting a low-key pro-EU campaign in which the
new government has not adopted an official pro-Union position. Mr Carlsson
was wary of mounting a strident campaign for fear of alienating many Social
Democrats who are sceptical about or hostile to the EU.
Instead, he appointed two prominent anti-Union campaigners to his cabinet
and allowed anti-EU Social Democrats to run their own party-financed
campaign.
Critics say this has made the task of winning over opinion within the ranks
of the party, by far the country's largest political organisation, much more
difficult.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Albanians reject new constitution: Referendum blocks
president's attempt to increase his powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Albanian voters have overwhelmingly rejected a constitution drafted by
President Sali Berisha which would have further shifted the balance of power
from parliament to the already powerful presidency. Preliminary results
indicate that more than 60 per cent of voters rejected it in a weekend
referendum called by Mr Berisha in breach of the existing constitution.
The revised communist-era document in force since 1991 reserves the right of
drawing up and approving a new constitution to parliament. But Mr Berisha,
whose Democratic party won a landslide victory in the 1992 elections, has
faced mounting opposition in parliament and within his own party for his
increasingly autocratic style. As a result he has lost the ability to force
legislation through parliament.
Last month more than a third of MPs from the government party abstained in a
parliamentary vote which deprived President Berisha of the majority needed
to legalise a referendum by which he sought to by-pass parliament.
The outcome of the vote is thus a striking confirmation of Albania's
conversion to democracy after decades of dictatorial rule by Mr Enver Hoxha
and his Communist party minions followed by only three years of multi-party
politics.
But it also marks a severe personal blow to Mr Berisha. The former heart
surgeon presided over a spectacular economic recovery from the ruins of the
bankrupt autarchic system inherited from 45 years of communist rule.
However, he antagonised many former supporters by riding roughshod over
parliament and by an increasingly personalised style of government.
Rejection of the proposed constitution is expected to embolden the various
opposition groups, including the former communist Socialist party whose
leader Mr Fatos Nano was jailed for alleged corruption last year. It is also
expected to encourage opposition parties, such as the Democratic Alliance
led by Mr Gramoz Pashko, to patch up their feuds and press for early
elections.
But the electorate's refusal to endorse the new constitution, which would
have given the president the power to appoint and dismiss the prime
minister, appoint ministers and preside over the supreme court, will further
delay Albania's entry into the Council of Europe. One of the requirements of
entry is a legitimate, democratic constitution. But Albania also faces
objections from Greece because of alleged discrimination against the ethnic
Greek minority in the south.

An international war crimes tribunal covering the former Yugoslavia formally
opens in The Hague today with a request for the extradiction from Germany of
a Bosnian Serb alleged to have killed three Moslem prisoners. The
prosecutor, Mr Richard Goldstone, a South African judge, will ask Germany to
hand over Mr Dusan Tadic, who is alleged to have murdered the prisoners at
the Omarska concentration camp in Serb-held northwestern Bosnia in 1992. Mr
Tadic was arrested in Germany last year.
The extradiction is important to the tribunal - the first international war
crimes court since the Nuremberg trials after the second world war - because
it has no power to try suspects in absentia. Jail cells have been set aside
in a Dutch prison in The Hague, but so far they remain empty.

Spain's January-September accumulated trade deficit widened by 5.1 per cent
to Pta1,860bn (Pounds 9.1bn) against the first nine months of 1993 despite a
continuing strong performance by the export sector, which grew by 33 per
cent over the period. The volume of imports and exports is expected to
increase during the fourth quarter of the year, although year-on-year growth
rates will be more moderate because trade already began to increase strongly
in the final three months of 1993. The finance ministry said import growth
showed that domestic demand was expanding at a higher rate than forecast.
Tom Burns, Madrid
Greece had a Dollars 23m (Pounds 14m) current account surplus in July,
against a July 1993 surplus of Dollars 1.152bn. The January-July current
account deficit was Dollars 1.071bn, sharply off a Dollars 205m surplus in
the same seven-month 1993 period.
Austrian unemployment in October was steady from September at 4.4 per cent
of the workforce, but was up from 4.2 per cent in October last year.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Brussels balks at German TV venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is understood to have serious reservations about a
planned joint venture by two big German media groups and the state telephone
monopoly.
The proposed venture between Bertelsmann, the world's second largest media
group, Kirchgruppe, one of Germany's biggest private television companies,
and Deutsche Telekom has been under investigation by the Commission since
July, following fears that it could create a dominant position in the German
market for pay television services.
The companies intend to set up a company, to be known as MSG Media Service,
to provide infrastructure, marketing and booking services for commercial
pay-TV, including such services as video-on-demand, home banking and
interactive television.
Suspicions that the deal contains anti-competitive elements have emerged
following a far-reaching probe by Brussels and an intense lobbying campaign
by the main participants.
The Commission has not yet taken a decision to block the deal, but pressure
is mounting on Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom to make adjustments
to the joint venture. 'The companies' proposal is unacceptable,' a Brussels
official said. 'They know it and (competition commissioner Karel) Van Miert
told them again today.'
The deal is likely to be blocked at the Commission's meeting tomorrow unless
the companies came up with the necessary changes to meet competition rules.
Mr Van Miert yesterday met representatives of the companies concerned, the
official said. The Commission is expected to announce its decision over the
next two weeks.
The joint venture plans to manage and distribute new television channels, as
well as other specialist telecommunications services on Telekom's network.
The company would distribute new pay-TV programmes, shopping-TV and other
services to 14.9m households which already have access to the cable network.
Telekom has laid the network for a further 6m.
The three partners are estimated to have invested around DM200m (Pounds 82m)
and are planning to develop their own decoding system which would offer
viewers a single billing system, charging them for what they watch.
Bertelsmann and Kirch are normally fierce rivals but both are already
shareholders in Premiere pay-TV.
In July, when the Commission announced it would undertake a full
investigation, it said it was concerned that the pay-TV market would expand
rapidly with the introduction of digital broadcasting in Germany over the
next few years. A very large number of households already receive cable or
satellite television.
Brussels is particularly uneasy that by dominating the pay-TV infrastructure
at an early stage, the joint venture would control standards for any
newcomers.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Boeing may tie component deals to aircraft sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's leading aircraft maker, has started a review of
purchasing policies aimed at directing future contracts for aircraft parts
to countries which buy its aircraft.
The review could result in the Seattle-based company shifting purchases away
from countries, such as Canada, whose governments and airlines have
increasingly opted for European Airbus aircraft.
Although no decisions have been taken, a Boeing official said yesterday the
review was designed to place work in a way which would 'assist in market
access'. Boeing's commercial aircraft division buys components from 323
suppliers in 38 countries outside the US.
The company, which has traditionally controlled about 60 per cent of the
world's commercial aircraft market but has been facing intense competition
from Airbus, is seeking to expand its presence in the fast-growing
Asia-Pacific market by offering sub-contracting work to Japanese and Chinese
manufacturers, and to aircraft makers in other Far Eastern countries.
Japanese manufacturers are responsible for about 20 per cent of the work on
the Boeing 777, the new twin-engine wide-bodied aircraft that will enter
service next year.
Airbus is also stepping up competition in these markets, recently announcing
a Dollars 25m agreement with the China Aviation Supplies Corporation to set
up a flight crew training centre in Beijing. The European consortium has
also been in talks with Japanese manufacturers to interest them in possible
collaboration over a new 800-seat aircraft.
Boeing's move was disclosed by Mr Ron Woodard, president of the company's
commercial aircraft group, in a speech to the Aerospace Industries
Association of Canada.
Mr Woodard complained that the Canadian defence department had not given
Boeing an opportunity to bid on replacements for a fleet of ageing Boeing
707 airliners. Instead, the Canadians bought five twin-engine wide-body
Airbus A-310s.
He noted that Boeing has spent about CDollars 800m (Pounds 370m) annually in
Canada over the past three years. But sales had dwindled to about CDollars
30m a year, all on components and not new aircraft.
'Our Canadian business placement must understandably be market based, as it
is elsewhere,' Mr Woodard said.
'Boeing supports the principal of the level playing field. We don't ask for
special considerations and we don't want to have to compete against special
considerations granted (to) others.'
Mr Woodard's comments have been interpreted as a shot across the bows of
Calgary-based Canadian Airlines International, which is expected to place
sizeable orders over the next few years to replace its Boeing 737
twin-engine, narrow-body fleet.
The Canadian government is also eyeing an order for search-and-rescue
helicopters. Boeing will review its Canadian contracts next week.
An official said that the review will would affect not only 130 contractors
in Canada, but also two plants in Manitoba and Ontario, which are Boeing's
only company-owned manufacturing sites outside the US.

FT  08 NOV 94 / UK's first Atlantic oilfield wins development go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Development of Britain's first offshore oilfield in the deep Atlantic waters
west of the Shetland Islands was given the go-ahead by the government
yesterday.
British Petroleum and Shell plan to spend Pounds 550m on developing
Foinaven, the first field in a region that preliminary drilling results
suggest may contain 4bn barrels of oil.
When fully developed, the region could produce up to a third of Britain's
present North Sea output of 2.5m barrels a day.
However, the field is in 450 metres of water and in a region, known as the
Atlantic Frontier, where weather can be harsher than in the North Sea and
sub-surface currents more complex.
As a result, production will not be from fixed platforms of the type used in
the North Sea. Foinaven's oil will be fed into a large ship, a production
and storage unit, moored over the sea-bed wells. The ship will feed a
shuttle service of tankers.
Production at Foinaven is scheduled to start by the end of next year.
British contractors have so far won 72 per cent of the work for developing
the field, amounting to some Pounds 400m of the Pounds 550m likely to be
spent. Other western European-based companies have won another 20 per cent.
Announcing the go-ahead yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy
minister, said the development would require 'novel approaches' from the oil
industry if the region was to reach its full potential.
Mr Eggar also signalled that the government would like a co-operative
approach to any pipeline project in the area in order to control costs.
The minister said oil industry interest in the region had been
unprecedented. Eighteen companies had bid for one of the blocks, the largest
number of bidders for any one area.
Although exploration is still at an early stage, a report by oil companies
identified 11 possible sites for development between 1995 and 2010 at a cost
of Pounds 9.5bn.
The report concludes that if the eventual reserves proved large enough, a
joint pipeline might result in considerable savings on operating expenses.
It might also lead to higher recovery rates, according to Mr Norman Smith,
managing tor of Smith Rea Energy Associates, one of the report's authors.
BP said that the bulk of spending in the North Sea went into fixed
platforms. But Foinaven's floating production facility would account for
just 35 per cent of spending. New methods of drilling and the complex subsea
wells would account for 35 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.

FT  08 NOV 94 / Businesses must expect less and invest more, Heseltine tells
CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses are not investing enough because they expect too great a return
on their investments, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
told the CBI's annual conference yesterday.
The criticism cast doubts on the likelihood of the chancellor granting
further tax concessions on investment in this month's Budget.
Mr Heseltine said: 'The CBI tells me that businesses look for steady demand,
for a decent return on new investment. You now have these conditions. But
you are still not investing enough.
'The CBI tells me that the majority of firms continue to require rates of
return above 20 per cent. A senior banker last week told me his bank
habitually asked for 30 per cent returns on capital. These figures speak for
themselves. They have a chilling message built into them.' A 30 per cent
return implies that projects have a pay-back period of only about three
years.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, the president of the CBI, acknowledged that 'clearly
there is the case for companies re-examining their rates of return'.
Mr Heseltine's criticism was an indirect rebuttal of the argument by Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, that the government's
competitiveness white paper contained a gap on the tax question.
Small-business lobby groups have been calling for the chancellor to give 100
per cent capital allowances on the first Pounds 100,000 of investment.
The CBI's national manufacturing council has identified consistently
sluggish investment as a prime factor behind the UK's productivity shortfall
relative to its competitors.
Mr Heseltine joined the CBI president in warning against excessive pay rises
for directors. 'Wage levels must reflect performance, in the boardroom as
well as on the shop floor,' he said.
In an effort to align his department with the concerns of business
rationalised by recession, Mr Heseltine said his first objective was to
reduce the size of the Department of Trade.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said: 'It sounds
suspiciously as if Michael Heseltine is again playing to the right wing of
his party by adopting the Michael Portillo line on the role of the DTI.'

FT  08 NOV 94 / Surge in output strengthens UK economic upturn: Inflation
fears depress equities and bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is expected to revise upwards its estimate of third-quarter
economic growth after official figures yesterday showed that industrial
production grew unexpectedly in the three months to September.
The output figures, which highlight the strong economic platform from which
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will launch his second Budget in three
weeks' time, were well above City expectations.
With other official data showing third-quarter growth in consumer credit
demand to record levels, fears that the economy might be slowing in a
delayed reaction to tax increases were allayed.
The good economic news contributed to a generally weaker tone on financial
markets. Brokerage houses argued that the figures provided further evidence
of a diminishing amount of spare capacity in the economy, although the
consequent fears of inflation and further base rate rises were only two of
several factors depressing equity and bond prices.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 31.8 points down at 3,065.8, while
gilt-edged government bonds lost about  1/2 point.
The Central Statistical Office reported that output of the production
industries, including manufacturing, oil and mineral extraction and
electricity, gas and water supply, jumped a seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent
between August and September.
It also revised upwards statistics for July and August, estimating the
present annual 'trend' rate of growth for production industry output at 6
per cent.
Manufacturing output, which accounts for just over 84 per cent of industrial
production, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in September compared
with August. The CSO said manufacturing output was now growing at a trend
rate of 5.5 per cent.
The Treasury welcomed yesterday's production figures, although it declined
to comment on the policy implications. Officials said growth was broadly
based and noted that the growth of output of investment goods, at 1.8 per
cent between the second and third quarters, was stronger than that of the
consumer or intermediate-goods sectors.
September's surge in industrial activity brought output of the production
industries to a new high. But it restored manufacturing output only to the
level of July 1990, on the eve of the last recession.
Production industry output has been buoyed by exceptionally strong oil and
gas production since the beginning of last year. Oil and gas output now
stands at a high after increasing by 3.5 per cent between August and
September as several fields returned to normal production after maintenance
closures in August.
As overall industrial production accounts for some 28 per cent of gross
domestic product, yesterday's figures are expected to boost third-quarter
GDP growth by at least 0.1 percentage points. If there are no substantial
downward revisions in other areas of economic activity, some economists
believe the UK may have grown at about 3.8 per cent in the year to the third
quarter compared with the provisional 3.6 per cent growth reported last
month.
The Confederation of British Industry, which will today hear a speech from
Mr Clarke at its annual conference in Birmingham, warned yesterday there was
no need for UK rates to rise.

FT  08 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of India (10): Millions of bells are
waiting to ring - Telephones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 1st December 1994) appended to this article.
For the past year and a half, Ms Boli Medappa been waiting for the phone to
ring in the suite which she occupies at the Sheraton hotel in New Delhi,
writes Gordon Cramb.
She is the India representative of US West, the Colorado-based
telecommunications company which, like many other industry multinationals,
is seeking a role in one of the world's largest potential telephone markets.
After several 'wrong numbers', US West and other the foreign service
providers are starting to receive calls from the Indian licensing
authorities.
In the last few weeks a batch of eight cellular licences has been granted
with minority foreign participation, two apiece to offer mobile phone
services for the first time in the four biggest cities. By the end of the
year, tenders should be out for the right to provide basic telephone
facilities in any of 18 regions of the country in competition with the
current government monopoly.
This follows the unveiling in May of a government telecoms policy which
recognised that its public sector monopolies would not be able to meet
growth in call traffic and, more particularly, demand for lines. India has
less than one line per 100 people, one of the lowest levels of phone
availability in the world, and would-be subscribers can wait a decade for a
residential connection.
Initially, peripheral services such as paging and electronic mail were
opened to private operators in 1992 - 'deregulated' is the wrong word, as
the bureaucrats at the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) attached a
sheaf of requirements to such licences. Pager companies are, to take an
example cited by an industry executive in Delhi, obliged to maintain a huge
electronic archive of messages relayed months or years in the past.
The cellphone licences initially awarded were challenged in the courts by
unsuccessful bidders and there followed a round of musical chairs as part of
which Bharti Telecom, a local maker of handsets whose bid has been backed by
small-scale European interests, moved the proposed site of its service from
Bombay to the area around Delhi.
Bharti won a Delhi franchise as a result but Tata Cellular, an offshoot of
India's biggest industrial group, failed to capitalise on a legal
intervention which for a time put it back in the running. It lost the
potentially lucrative Bombay slot to rival ventures backed by France Telecom
and the originally excluded Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong. This time Tata
did not immediately appeal.
An eccentricity of that contest was that bidders were required to propose a
pricing structure, and were awarded points under a secret system based in
part on how cheaply they said they could offer a service - but the
department then fixed a tariff regime and will allow price competition, if
at all, only at the margins.
The formula under which revenues will be shared with the government operator
is one of the main issues yet to be resolved before tenders are invited for
new entrants to provide basic telephone services covering each of 18 regions
of the country.
The carve-up, which approximates to India's state boundaries, has got
another clutch of telecoms companies from abroad jostling for the prime
positions. US West, which has more than Dollars 1bn ready to invest in
India, has for example long had its eyes on the south of the country where
economic growth is vigorous.
Long-distance traffic is to remain a national preserve for the next five
years, disappointing industry analysts who view that end of the business as
more lucrative than providing local links to thousands of villages. Although
Ms Medappa says that 'we didn't ask for that and didn't expect it,' many
think interstate services will be opened up earlier than the government has
indicated.
Mr D K Gupta of the Telecoms Commission, the department's policy unit, says
India's needs in long-distance communications are less acute than for basic
services. The primary role of the new entrants is to supply at least a
quarter of the 10m lines which the country aims to add by March 1997. He
notes that local services 'have not been opened up even in many developed
countries. We are starting with these.'
The aim will be to provide universal access to a telephone rather than a
universal service - in other words, public phones in more remote villages
rather than one by every bedside. Wireless technology will help bring down
the cost of putting in place a regional network, but there is a suspicion
among Indian commentators that the private sector operators will seek to
skim the cream off the urban business market in order to get the return on
capital they seek.
If so, that would remove the DoT's best customers - who by one estimate
account for 15 per cent of the lines but 80 per cent of the revenue. But Mr
Gupta, satisfied that the DoT will remain the predominant operator, also
says that it will have its work cut out meeting its own quota of new
connections.
To the previously cossetted public sector unions, which have been aghast at
the changes, he offers the reassurance: 'Whatever we have by way of
overstaffing will be compensated for by expansion' in a market which is
growing by some 20 per cent a year.
The DoT anyway remains protected by its effectively zero cost of capital and
its exemption from tax. Moreover, it controls the selection of its
competitors and the terms under which they will operate. The telecoms
regulatory authority to be established under the new regime will also report
to the minister and will, says Mr Amit Sharma of Motorola, the US equipment
manufacturer, 'take time to establish a credible record' of neutrality.
The authority, in the process of being constituted, will rule on tariffs,
monitor quality of service and ensure connectivity between service
providers. Worries over its role, and the commitment of the government to
even-handedness, have been fuelled in recent weeks by a spate of upheavals
within the ministry.
Mr N Vittal, architect of many of the reforms, departed abruptly from his
post as its chief civil servant - he was telecoms secretary and chairman of
the telecoms commission - after clashes with Mr Sukh Ram, telecoms minister,
who is suspected of being less than wedded to liberalisation. Mr Vittal's
replacement, Mr R K Takkar, has expressed his intention, however, to 'get
cracking' with the programme.
At the same time, movement has been slow on a scheduled relaunch of the
Euroequity issue to reduce the government's holding in Videsh Sanchar Nigam
(VSNL), the international carrier, which was aborted earlier this year
because the market saw it as overpriced.
The issue is now to be underwritten, but just as the lead managers were
dusting off the prospectus Mr B K Syngal resigned as VSNL chairman. A
further delay ensued.
VSNL is one of two opportunities for indirect investment in the sector. A
minority stake in Mahangar Telephone Nigam, which controls telecoms services
in Bombay and Delhi, is also being floated.
A missed opportunity so far has been a failure to exploit the growth in
cable television networks serving the biggest Indian cities.
CORRECTION
In the survey of India published on November 8 it was incorrectly reported
that Mr B K Syngal had resigned as chairman of VSNL, the international
telecoms carrier. He remains in that post.

FT  07 NOV 94 / GM opens car plant in Warsaw
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the US carmaker, has begun to assemble cars in Poland in a
joint venture with Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych (FSO), the Polish
state-owned carmaker.
GM Poland, which is 70 per cent owned by GM and 30 per cent by FSO, is
aiming initially to assemble 10,000 cars a year at the Warsaw plant with a
workforce of 125 following an investment of around DM30m (Dollars 20m)
The FSO plant is also one of several locations in Europe under investigation
by GM for a much more ambitious investment in the production of a new range
of small cars.
GM Poland will produce initially the Opel/Vauxhall Astra small family saloon
car in an SKD (semi-knocked-down) kit assembly operation. Painted bodies
will be delivered to Warsaw by train from the Opel plant at Antwerp,
Belgium, along with engines, transmissions and other components from the
group's plant at Bochum, Germany.
The Astra, GM's best-selling car worldwide, with sales of 700,000 forecast
for 1994, is currently assembled at plants in the UK, Belgium and Germany
and at smaller facilities in Hungary, Turkey and Taiwan.
Mr Jack Smith, GM chief executive, said at the weekend at the opening of the
Warsaw plant that GM was also planning to begin Astra production in Brazil,
Indonesia, India and Thailand.
The assembly operation in Warsaw is GM's third investment in vehicle
production in east Europe following the building of a car plant at Eisenach
in eastern Germany, and an engine and small volume car plant at
Szentgotthard in Hungary.
Mr Smith said that 'Poland is and will remain a potential for future Opel
car and component production.'
GM is also committed to examining the prospects for producing a replacement
vehicle for FSO's outdated Polonez saloon car in Warsaw.
The Warsaw workforce can be increased to 250 for two-shift working and GM
said that the operation had the flexibility to raise output to 33,000 a year
with additional investment and employment.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (27): Patience is paramount - Doing business
in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNNE CURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doing business in China today is dramatically different from ten years ago.
As China continues its dizzying rush toward modernization, many of the rules
have changed. Into this fluid and chaotic situation pour senior executives
from countries all over the world. In an atmosphere reminiscent of a gold
rush, China has become an intensely competitive free-for-all in which
foreign companies are fighting for market share, skilled personnel and
office space.
'Everyone is focusing on China - companies see it as having a huge market
potential,' said Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Beijing. 'Everyone's competitor is focusing on China and they
are willing to undercut each other. Your real market competitors are the
foreign manufacturers your company faces elsewhere.'
Companies seeking to do business in this environment will find that in many
ways conditions have improved dramatically.
One result of the China boom has been a striking improvement in the
logistics of doing business, with better infrastructure, easier access to
faxes, copiers and international phone calls, and greater availability of
taxis and minibuses. Moreover, after a decade and half of exposure to the
outside world, the Chinese are much more open to dealing with foreigners and
there is a greater effort to make public rules and regulations.
In another significant change, managers in state-run factories have more
power to make their own decisions and even own a stake of the equity. The
work force is more mobile and foreign companies are able to hire
well-qualified local staff of their choosing.
For all of the changes, though, certain fundamentals of doing business with
the Chinese have not changed. For newcomers, good advice is to look outside
the main cities of Beijing and Shanghai to see the real chaotic China where
basic infrastructure lags well behind its economic development and
aspirations.
'If you only go to Beijing and Shanghai and zoom around in taxis, you'll get
a distorted picture,' says Anne Stevenson-Yang, chief representative of the
US-China Business Council. Experienced China traders also say that having
patience is still an absolute necessity. Under tremendous pressure to
produce results because of the high cost of being in the country, foreign
businessmen often cannot move slowly enough to adapt to the market.
'China moves incredibly slowly,' says Steve Crandall, president of Crandall
Ford International, a dealership representing the American auto giant in
Tianjin. 'A standard USDollars 500,000 negotiation here takes seven 12-hour
days.'
Negotiations about purchases of imported products will often start with what
would be considered a given in western countries. For example, car sales
discussions involve such basics as whether a motor would be included in the
price.
In addition, the approval process for using foreign exchange to buy imported
products can take a year or longer as it goes through the bureaucracy.
'If a person comes in today, he or she won't see results for 12 to 15
months,' says AmCham's president Phil Carmichael. 'If your company has put
up one to one to Dollars 1.5m up front and doesn't get an immediate return,
that doesn't mean your rep is not going a good job. He could be sowing seeds
for your company the following year.'
Looking for a compatible partner is one of the most challenging assignments
and one that often goes easily wrong. Businessmen stressed the importance of
not entering into a deal with the first individual claiming to have special
contacts.
'A lot of companies are sent off on the wrong track because they know one
American or overseas Chinese who claims to have good connections with
bureauracy,' says Stevenson-Yang. 'Even if he has good connections in one
ministry, this could become a liability if you 'tie your horse to only one
wagon.''
Researching the background of potential partners is vital to avoiding
problems later. Many sources of information are available, including embassy
commercial sections, other companies in similar industries, consultants, and
even reports from ministries that rank domestic companies' performances.
Another common pitfall is racing to sign a letter of intent without
investigating other options. Although these documents are not legally
binding, the Chinese present them internally as proposals for joint
ventures. The Chinese would rather negotiate with foreigners than tell their
own officials to give up a point.
'Be careful what you sign,' a western attorney warns. 'It may look innocent
enough, but it may come back to bite you.'
Investors should carefully weigh the benefits of establishing a wholly-owned
enterprise or a joint venture. While joint ventures may be a suitable
option, even with a large equity stake, they are often an uneasy marriage,
with problems arising over profit distribution, management, and the number
of workers.
Partners need not always be in the same industry as the foreign company as
long as both parties have a common vision. Baskin Robbin's, an American ice
cream maker, relies on its sales agent, a subsidiary of the military-run
Great Wall Company which is involved in satellite launches, for its
knowledge of how to work the bureaucracy in order to bring its American-made
ice cream through customs.
A tight property market has made office premises and residential
accommodation in Beijing almost as expensive as those in Hong Kong. There
are long waiting lists for every first class building in the capital, but a
downturn is expected in mid-1996 as more commercial space becomes available.
Until then, the best practice is to remain flexible, sign only short term
leases and look for creative alternatives, such as renting space from a
customer.
With executives working long hours and travelling on the road much of the
time, China is not an easy place for an unoccupied spouse.
Spouses with Chinese language skills have a reasonable chance of finding a
job with a joint venture company or one of the many western companies doing
business here.
But for those who do not, taking crash courses in Chinese can help with
basic communication. Other options can include pursuing a particular
interest, or, for a fluent English speaker in today's climate, marketing
that ability to land a job as an English teacher or polisher.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (26): Cultural elite are ready for change -
Voices for reform versus the traditional party line / Since the mid-1980s,
Hong Kong and Taiwan have become the real cultural trend-setters on the
Chinese mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEREMIE BARME
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In China, packaging is everything. Even cultural dissidents have learnt that
with the correct marketing ploys, being on the fringe does not mean you are
on the 'outside.'
While Labour activists and human rights campaigners - especially those in
the provinces who have never enjoyed the international media limelight in
Beijing or Shanghai - are regularly harassed and jailed, the more colourful
and controversial rowdies enjoy an enthralling, symbiotic relationship with
the authorities.
Take, for example, the case of China Through the Third Eye, the publishing
cause celebre of recent months. Highly critical of the conditions of
'primitive capitalism' that many of the Communist Party's economic reforms
have inculcated in China, including social inequities and rampant
corruption, the book gained a wide readership over the summer. An official
ban was issued and the black-market value of the volume soared.
The author of the book had given voice to a number of 'conservative'
opinions (this depends on your reading of the Chinese political spectrum
which can mean anti-reform, pro-state authority, or leftist deviationist),
and it was touted as being the incisive work of a German scholar.
Yet no such scholar can be found: it turned out that for maximum
publicity-value, the publisher and the real author, a man who goes under the
name Wang Shan, had created the foreign persona.
In the days when Party censorship was at its height, such a book would not
have hit the streets. Today, as in the case of so many works (like Jia
Pingwa's best-selling 1993 pornographic pulp novel The Necropolis),
publishers produce and sell a book before the authorities bother imposing a
ban.
Subsequently, copies are withdrawn and a suitable fine - in some instances,
negotiated - is then imposed. In the meantime, everyone has been able to
read the offending volume and dividends are shared all around. Such a state
of affairs begs some questions: Is this ironical censorship, a state where
everything banned has after-the-fact quotation marks around it? Is China the
first post-modern totalitarian nation? Or is it that the commissars' hearts
are just not in their work any more?
Meanwhile, mainstream official culture still churns out its usual
product-line of stodgy propaganda pieces gussied-up in the tawdry drag of
Hong Kong and Taiwan pop culture. There are endless 'soap operas' about
Party officials and the good fight, the regulation number of
politically-correct war movies and tear-jerkers, plus reams of printed
propaganda fulfilling state quotas at every level.
But strapped by limited funds and suffering from a serious image problem,
the cultural authorities - a nationwide network of bureaucracies covering
every aspect of cultural activity and life in the country - have been in
retreat for some years. The impact of more ideologically steadfast elements
is summed up in the common Beijing saying that 'their rule doesn't extend
beyond the Third Ring Road (of Beijing),' since all they control is a couple
of journals and newspapers, and they only have the support of a handful of
officials.
The real mainstream these days is the sensational tabloid press. More than
2,000 newspapers are now registered for publication, many of which have
appeared in the last two years. Scandal, murder and mayhem are the stuff of
popular entertainment.
Starved of such pap on television - unless they have a satellite dish, or
wok as dishes are called in Chinese - to receive StarTV or MTV, the masses
turn to movies (mostly pirated offshore videos); pulp fiction (Mills and
Boon has recently fixed a gimlet eye on the Chinese mainland market); and
saccharine Canto-pop from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Since the mid-1980s, Hong Kong and Taiwan have become the cultural
trend-setters on the mainland. They are modern, their communications more
developed and their consumer cultures more sophisticated than those of the
more stodgy and out-of-touch capital, Beijing, in the north.
Even the 'underground' - non-official musicians, artists, film-makers,
writers and thinkers - have increasingly surfaced to sign contracts with
Hong Kong and Taiwan outlets.
Younger cultural figures have noted the success of the leading film-makers
Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, and even their own fringe colleagues such as the
middle-aged poet Mang Ke, a founding editor of the non-official 1970s
journal Today, whose novel Unruly Acts, a fictional account of his early
literary career, was published earlier this year.
They see the possibilities of using China as a backdrop for artistic
endeavours that are aimed at an elite Western or middle-class Asian
audience, and the exigencies of exploiting China's reputation as a
repressive totalitarian state for the marketing of their work.
Like their Hong Kong and Taiwan compatriots this group remains at the
forefront of a process of 'Othering the Motherland,' a process of exploiting
the mystique of socialist China.
They still get banned and harassed, but those who have made a name for
themselves are feted internationally.
It should be pointed out, however, that there are still many cultural
taboos. While gay themes have been exploited more readily, cross-undressing
is a no-no. In mid-June, the transgressive cross-dressing performance artist
Ma Liuming of Beijing stripped himself naked in his courtyard house in front
of an audience of nine. He then proceeded to cook a large pot of sweet
potatoes garnished with an earring and a watch. This stew was then
ceremoniously interred. The coup de grace came when police detained the
performer, his assistant and the entire audience.
Ma may have fallen into a little bother, but his stunt has set him on the
path to protective renown. His 'work' is featured in a new snazzy
non-official art journal that appeared in Beijing in September. It is run by
editors who commute between the Chinese capital and New York.

Rowing the boat out
1993:
October 13:
The Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZE) announced that the minimum time allowed
between buying and selling B-shares would be reduced from three days to one
day, as of 18 October, in order to stimulate market activity. Reportedly,
from November 1, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHE) would allow investors to
see B-shares on the same day they bought them.
1994:
February 22:
The SZE announced that new listings of A-shares on the SZE would be
suspended until further notice. The suspension was lifted on April 6,
apparently because the measure failed to help revive the market.
March 12:
Securities Supervisory Committee chairman Liu Hongru announced four
measures, effective immediately, to revive the market:
The issue of Rmb 5.5bn-worth of new shares planned for 1994 would be
postponed until the second half of this year or early next year.
No stock transaction tax would be levied for 1994 or 1995.
State and legal person shares would not be listed on either stock exchange,
and would not be merged with individual shares this year.
Rights issues by listed companies would be strictly controlled.
April 7, 25:
Both the SZE and SHE reportedly set a target of USDollars 100m for this
year's new B-share issues, the same as in 1993, in order to restore market
confidence.
May 13:
The State Council Securities Committee announced that, with immediate
effect, all companies preparing for listing on the SZE or SHE had to undergo
six months' coaching by the relevant department before being listed. This
was to enable companies to set up a system comparable to a share-holding
company. The introduction of the new rule effectively postponed all new
A-share listings planned for 1994 until next year.
July 28:
No more A-share issues in 1994.
A-share issues in 1995 to be controlled tightly.
New rules on placements.
Domestic mutual funds to be encouraged.
Sino-foreign investment trusts to be allowed.
Credit to be made easier for securities companies.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (21): Focus on the short-term - Shanghai
stock market
</HEADLINE>

When stockbrokers start blaming their clients, it is a clear sign that it is
not going to be a good year. So, if the complaints to be heard in Shanghai
these days are an indication, 1994 is shaping up as a very poor year indeed,
writes Simon Holberton.
'Investment strategy is very short term,' says Mr Huang Jun, head of
institutional sales, at Shanghai International Securities (SIS). 'There is a
lack of knowledge about fundamental analysis. Investors look at financial
statements but lack the expertise to interpret them.'
'The investment situation is not ideal,' agrees Mr Huang Guexian, a senior
director of Shenyin Securities, a large Shanghai brokerage. 'There are many
individual investors and few institutions. The individuals are mostly
investors who lack long-term intentions.'
The cry of short-termism is often heard in Shanghai. Only recently the
Liberation Daily, the Communist party's mouthpiece in the city, upbraided
investors for being far too prepared to trade on rumour. 'Some illegal
institutions and big shots are coining rumours to force investors to sell at
a loss. At other times they conjure up non-existent news to attract
followers,' the paper said last month.
The Shanghai market has performed like a yo-yo so far this year. Share
prices in Shanghai had been on a steady decline until the end of July, when
the A-share index hit an all-time low of 328.9. A-shares can be owned only
by Chinese nationals, while foreigners have a limited access to Chinese
stocks through B-shares.
To cries of 'Do something]' from brokers and investors alike, the China
Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) announced a series of measures to
support the market.
These measures included a re-iteration of the ban on new A-share issues for
1994; a promise to control more rigorously A-share issues in 1995; an
undertaking to permit Sino-foreign joint venture investment funds to invest
in A-shares; and the extension of selective credit lines to securities
companies to help fund their trading.
The announcement of these measures had the immediate effect of boosting
prices. By the end of August the A-share index was about to break through
the 1,000 point barrier - more than three times its level of not quite two
months before.
Since then, however, the market has been buffeted, mainly by rumours
concerning the health of Deng Xiaoping, China's 90-year-old senior leader.
By the middle of last month the index was hovering around 650 - 35 per cent
off its peak for the year.
In addition to complaints about rumours, the failure to follow through the
July measures has disappointed brokers. Mr Huang dismissed the moratorium on
new A-share listings as 'nothing new.'
For foreign investment bankers the gyrations of the Shanghai market are
those expected of a market in the early years of development. They are more
intent on building their offices for the day - not too far off - when
foreigners will be able to trade A-shares.
They are also looking forward to the time when the Chinese corporate sector
becomes more attuned to western corporate finance techniques of
capital-raising, and mergers and acquisitions.
For Mr Richard Graham, chief representative of Baring, the UK investment
bank, in Shanghai, corporate research, carried out by properly-trained local
staff is the place to start.
'You have to create your research team on the ground. China is no
different,' he says. 'Hong Kong and Taiwanese analysts are not well-suited
to looking at Chinese companies. They don't understand the culture. They
come in wearing flashy clothes, speaking bad and aggressive Mandarin - it
doesn't go down very well with hassled local executives.'
The prospect of a unified stock market, where the distinction between A and
B shares is removed, will be good for the foreign investor, Mr John
Crossman, general manager of Jardine Fleming in Shanghai believes.
Capitalisation of the A-share market in Shanghai is more than four times
that of the B-share market.
In corporate finance Mr Crossman notes that China's preference for equity
rather than debt means there are opportunities for bringing together foreign
equity and technology in strategic alliances. 'We're seeing where we can
expand,' he says.
Baring's Mr Graham also sees this as fertile ground. 'The real question for
investment banks here is the future of mergers and acquisition work,' he
notes. 'You won't get Chinese companies to pay for that sort of advice at
the moment, but foreign companies might.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (25): Key facts on China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Population and main cities
China's main cities include Shanghai (population 13.4m); the capital,
Beijing (formerly Peking, 10.9m), Tianjin (9.1), Shenyang (4.5m), Wuhan
(3.7m), Guangzhou (Canton, 3.5m). Office rent and occupation costs have been
rising sharply in Beijing and Shanghai (see chart, right, also Shanghai
report, page five). Other main cities with populations of well over 2m are
Harbin, Xian, Nanjing, Chongqing, Dalian, Jinan, Changchun and Qingdao.
China's estimated population is 1,185,170,000 - nearly a quarter of the
world's total population.
Ethnic groups
The number and percentages of main ethic groups include Han (Chinese),
1.042bn (91.96%); Zhuang, 15.4m (1.37%); Manchu, 9.8m (0.87%); Hui 8.6m
(0.76%); 7.3m (0.65%); Uygur, 7.2m (0.64%); Yi, 6.5m (0.58%); Tujia 5.7m
(0.50%); Mongolian 4.8m (0.42%); Tibetan, 4.5m (0.41%).
Race and language
The population of China is primarily of Mongoloid descent. About 93 per cent
is Han, the remainder consisting of 56 groups known as the minority
nationalities. Four major language families are found in China, the most
important being the Sino-Tibetan, spoken by the Han Chinese.
Currency
The yuan/renminbi is illegal tender for payment of hotel, travel and other
services by foreigners travelling in China. The current exchange rate
(November, 1994) is approximately Yn8.5 to US Dollars 1. Foreign currency
must be declared on entry.
Visas
Visas are essential for visitors to China. Regulations regarding visas have
been in a state of flux: it is now possible to present oneself at any large
Chinese point of entry and be given a two-week visa on the spot. Visas are
also issued by the Hongkong office China Travel Service at 77 Queen's Road,
Central, Hongkong, or at 27-33 Nathan Rd, Kowloon and at the People's
Republic of China Visa Office, China Resources Building, 26 Harbour Rd,
Wanchai, Hongkong. Application can be made by mail or in person.
Travel agencies arranging China tours, especially in Hongkong, will
frequently obtain a visa on your behalf.
Changes in itinerary after arrival may require approval. For travel to all
but 257 specified destinations, travel permits are also required.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (22): Disputes delay securities law - Local
and foreign stockbrokers want one authority to admininster a single set of
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last year China's securities market regulators and participants
were looking forward with confidence to the nation's first securities law, a
law that would bring market supervision, licensing and regulation under one
authority.
Today, summing up the situation, one regulator described his position as
'dismayed and ineffective.' China's attempts to emulate the West in devising
a regulatory framework for its rapidly growing securities markets appear to
have fallen foul of bureaucratic politics in Beijing.
The problems which policymakers in Beijing have met in producing a unified
securities law are emblematic of decision-making in modern China. To some
observers the process is an endless series of behind-the-scenes horse
trading as interest groups in the bureaucracy jockey for preferment and
position. The outcome is often a second-best solution to the problem.
The local and foreign stock broking community in Shanghai - the financial
centre on the mainland of China - is almost completely agreed on the need
for a coherent set of rules, administered by a single institution, by which
to operate. Mr Huang Guexian, a director of Shenyin Securities, the biggest
broker in Shanghai, says the securities industry in China is in urgent need
of an all-encompassing securities law.
'If companies from other provinces want to list here we can only regulate
them using Shanghai regulations,' he says.
'We are in urgent need of such a law. The market also wants a unified power.
If every province goes its own way, you get a contradiction in regulation.
You can set up a branch of the regulator in Shanghai who represents the
power.'
Shanghai's small but growing group of western investment bankers share Mr
Huang's views. Mr John Crossman, general manager or Jardine Fleming in
Shanghai, says that what the market has hoped and argued for is a regulator
in Beijing based on the model of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in the US - 'we've been telling them: 'Give us an SEC, tell us what
the ground rules are and enforce them for all.'
'I suspect we are not going to see a securities law for some time,' he adds.
Not all, however, agree that changes to the proposed law will be bad. Mr
Huang Jun, head of institutional sales at Shanghai International Securities,
says: 'You just can't put a US system here. It needs substantial changes.
The delay in the securities law is to make the law more acceptable to local
conditions.'
The failure by Beijing to produce a securities law - it was due out this
summer - appears to be the result of bruising contest between the China
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and a number of powerful
institutions, such as the People's Bank and the Ministry of Finance, which
are loath to yield power to the CSRC, an institution less than two years
old.
The battlefield for this contest has been in the standing committee of the
National People's Congress - China's parliament - in whose name national
laws are promulgated. The participants have been the economic and finance
sub-committee of the NPC - with support from the CSRC's - and the legal work
committee. Both committees produced conflicting versions of a securities law
and have been unable to reconcile those differences.
The exact details of where the two proposed bills disagree is not known. A
key difference is believed to be the authority conferred upon the CSRC.
Under the economic and finance committee's law the commission was to be the
sole regulator. The draft prepared by the legal work committee is believed
to have left the issue of which institution has regulatory power vague.
'The legal work committee wants to leave it fuzzy,' says one knowledgeable
observer. 'So regulatory power will be divided between the State Council,
Ministry of Finance, the central bank, CSRC . . . everyone.
'They said they didn't want to make it clear because no-one wants to make it
clear.'
Observers in Shanghai also say that the delay in the publication of the law
reflects a certain hesitancy by the authorities. Western brokers say that it
has been difficult for the Chinese authorities to come to grips with what a
securities market is and how it can work for the benefit of China.
'They are trying to regulate what should happen, rather than describe a
framework in which a market can work,' one broker observes.
'I think they have become confused and don't know what to do with the
securities law; they don't want to make a mistake.'
Mr Richard Graham, chief representative of Baring, the UK investment bank,
detects a change in policy that appears to be political - 'there was a
definite change from the Party Congress (in 1992) to this year's National
People's Congress typified by the change in language from 'reform' to
'stability',' he observes.
This, he claims, led to a change in the central banking law, which drew back
from allowing banks the freedom to set interest rates and reserved that
power for the People's Bank. The securities law is a victim of the same
thinking.
'The law was going to confirm the CSRC as the regulator of the securities
industry but the People's Bank put its foot down; it wants to control the
listing of companies and the supervision of the stock exchanges,' he said.
The bureaucratic infighting about the securities law has raised fears that
it may end up with similar deficiencies to those from which China's newly
promulgated company law suffers.
The company law came into effect on July 1 and is ambiguous as to the
precedence of national over provincial law, especially in the area of
securities. This leaves vague the position of Shanghai and Shenzhen
regulations in relation to the national law.
Moreover, the law lacks adequate provisions for the overseas listing of
mainland companies; it fails to specify the maximum proportion of a company
which any individual may own (as did previous regulations); or, what
constitutes a quorum at an annual general meeting of a company. In short it
is weak in adequately defining ownership.
In the particularly harsh judgment of one local observer, the company law as
drafted is 'incongruent with the principle and practice of company law.'
In the view of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, 'the transition from the old
to the new system envisaged under the company law will certainly be marked
by confusion and may take years to accomplish.'
The new securities law may not have been able to rectify the errors in the
company law - some of which will be the subject of 21 supplementary
regulations currently being drafted - but officials and investment bankers
had hoped the law would have coherence. It is not now clear if those hopes
are well-founded.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (24): New business clubs prove popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Business club elitism seems to be an idea that goes down well in nominally
socialist China where access and contacts are the keys to success, writes a
correspondent in Beijing.
Twenty business, private and country clubs are either open or in the works
in Beijing, all of them vying to raise membership among foreign executives,
Chinese tycoons and even government officers forced by official rules to
enrol under the name of their wives or relatives.
The Chinese press estimates that 60 business and golf clubs are under
construction across the country.
New clubs market their prestige and facilities fiercely, advertising in
print and on the radio, offering such incentives as free trips and pitching
enrolment in limited memberships as an investment that will pay off
handsomely in the future.
'I am besieged with calls from these clubs, I refuse to speak to them any
more,' says an executive with an American bank.
Perched on the 50th floor of Capital Mansion near a north Beijing diplomatic
enclave, the Capital Club is the latest entry, boasting a panoramic view of
the smoggy Chinese capital and a board of governors that is a mini Who's Who
of Beijing government and business.
A joint venture between the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (Citic) and the Club Corporation of America, the club will soon
fill its 400 capacity membership roll. In addition to a wood-panelled
corporate ambience and dining areas designed like boardrooms, the club also
has a recreation centre with a glass-domed swimming pool, bowling lanes,
billiard tables and a golf simulator.
The membership fees of Dollars 7,500 for corporations and Dollars 5,000 for
individuals include access to 200 associated private and country clubs in 14
countries.
'We are trying to provide better opportunities for each member to do
business and for foreign and Chinese businessmen to exchange views,' says
Robert Dedman, chairman of Club Corp. of America, operator of two other
clubs in the southern Chinese cities of Zhuhai and Zhaoqing.
Other facilities in Shanghai and Guangzhou are planned. In December, the
Changan Club - entrance fees are Dollars 28,000 for corporations and Dollars
20,000 for individuals - with private tennis courts, saunas, gymnasiums and
dining rooms, will open not far from the walled citadel of China's Communist
leadership, Zhongnanhai. The club is a venture between the Beijing Sports
Commission and Fu Wah International Enterprises of Hong Kong.
Some business sceptics question whether the plethora of planned private
clubs will attract the gilded ranks of China's new millionaires - 'Beijing
citizens still don't understand the concept of the business club.
'It's the same old problem here: the old culture could go on for another 25
years,' comments one club manager.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (19): Hong Kong's role is crucial - For now,
Hong Kong remains the main international financial centre for the mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ultimately, bankers and brokers expect Shanghai to take on the role of
China's New York: but for now, the mainland's financial centre is firmly
based in the 1,070 sq kms of territory now under British rule.
Hong Kong has long capitalised on its geographical position in terms of
China trade, but its role as a money-raising centre has emerged more
recently and is reflected in the growing number - and size - of foreign
financial institutions setting up shop in the colony.
Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs have doubled their Hong Kong
head-count in the space of a year (in Goldman's case, to 400 from 200).
While beefing up Hong Kong staffing levels is indicative of the lure of Asia
in general, the emphasis on the colony over Tokyo or Singapore more
particularly underlines the starring role of China.
China's massive spending programmes - such as a planned USDollars 120bn over
the next decade on power and Yn54bn (Dollars 6.35bn) this year on building
telephone lines - will ensure it is a regular user of the world capital
markets. However, its relative inexperience means that - for now - it is
highly dependent on overseas markets for experts who can dovetail its needs
with those of international investors.
This can be a frustrating role for the colony's bankers - as those working
in power project financing could testify. Nearly a year's worth of
economically viable power deals have been mothballed because investors are
demanding higher rates of return than Beijing is willing to concede.
However, perseverance is expected to pay off and many are looking for a
relaxation from Beijing during the course of next year.
One of the biggest roles in China's cash-raising drive has been played by
the Hong Kong stock exchange, Asia's second biggest stock market and the
first overseas bourse to establish the regulatory framework for mainland
companies to secure an overseas listing directly - that is, without first
registering offshore or buying into a shell company to engineer a 'backdoor
listing.'
So far, 11 mainland companies have raised a total HKDollars 13.4bn
(USDollars 1.7bn) on the Hong Kong stock exchange through the creation of H
shares; some 15 selected companies are scheduled to follow.
The role of conduit between Chinese issuer and international investor was
conceived in early 1992, soon after Mr Charles Lee - who retired last month
 -took up the chairmanship. H shares, former mainland state-owned
enterprises listing in the colony, were effectively borne out of the
conclusion that growth potential must lie beyond Hong Kong - a conclusion
many of the exchange's members were also discovering.
The fruits of lengthy negotiations between regulatory authorities in Hong
Kong and China - with the former seeking to ensure issuers complied with
international standards - was a joint Memorandum of Understanding and the
hugely successful listing of Tsingtao Brewery, the company responsible for
China's best known beer, in July of last year: the HKDollars 889m issue was
110 times oversubscribed. Tsingtao was one of an initial list of nine
state-owned companies selected for an overseas listing, all of which are now
trading in Hong Kong. A second list of 22 companies followed in January, of
which around 17 will have their primary listing in Hong Kong, and the
expectation is for still bigger lists in subsequent years.
Some 15 months on, sentiment has waned heavily: a reflection of concerns
over China's overheating economy and the impending demise of paramount
leader and architect of China's capitalist drive, Deng Xiaoping, allied with
more widespread fears, such as rising interest rates, which are hurting
markets worldwide.
Price earnings multiples have fallen sharply: from almost 18 in the case of
Tsingtao to just nine in the case of Qingling Motors, the light duty truck
maker which raised a total HKDollars 1.04bn in August.
The stock exchange, however, is not allowing the vacillations of sentiment
to undermine its position as the premier exchange for the issuance and
trading of China securities. In August, Hang Seng Index Services, which is
responsible for the colony's blue chip index of the same name, launched an H
share index as a specific barometer for the mainland companies, raising
their profile and providing an investment benchmark. In its latest blueprint
for the future, The Way Forward, the stock exchange shows its hand will
remain stacked in favour of China: 'Most participants with whom the exchange
met stressed that the single most important issue facing the exchange was
how it could best serve China's capital formation needs. It was felt that
serving these needs represented the exchange's best opportunity of long term
future growth.'
The exchange is now considering the introduction of a more active debt
market, in part to carve a further niche in enabling China incorporated
institutions to raise capital through bond issues in Hong Kong. While China
bonds have been arranged by Hong Kong bankers - especially where
distribution is aimed at the South East Asian market (the so-called dragon
bond market) the bigger global issues tend to have been handled further
afield.
However, both the government and private sectors remain alert to the fact
Hong Kong cannot take for granted its role as China's premier capital
raising market.
Some believe that Hong Kong's spiralling costs and deteriorating skills,
especially in English and Putonghua, the main spoken language of China,
could erode this role.
Mr David Li, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and chief executive
of Bank of East Asia, the third biggest listed bank in the colony, recently
warned of another, altogether closer, rival:
'Within China itself, Shanghai is aiming to become the leading financial
centre. There is talk that Shanghai may replace Hong Kong. It can sometimes
be easier to recruit talented employees in China than it is in Hong Kong.
'The possibility that Shanghai could replace Hong Kong is at the heart of
the challenges we face. Because many of our strengths can be reproduced, or
even transferred, the possibility of tomorrow's Shanghai is sobering. It
suggests that we could lose the race for greater competitiveness.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (18): Cautious policy on debt - The number
of bond issuers is set to rise but tight government control on borrowing
will be maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The presence of Chinese borrowers in the international bond markets is set
to increase substantially in coming years as the country's massive
infrastructure programme raises the need for more foreign investment.
But while the number of Chinese borrowing agencies and the volume of supply
are likely to rise markedly, observers say China's conservative foreign debt
management will ensure that the market will not get swamped with supply.
'The key feature of China's risk profile is its commitment to keeping debt
under control,' says Mr Stephen Taran, director for fixed-income research
Asia at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.
'There should be an increase in the types of issuers, but changes will take
place within a framework where the central government retains tight control
over borrowing.'
Indeed, a finance ministry official recently said that the government would
closely monitor borrowing by state agencies and corporations to ensure that
China's debt service ratio did not exceed 15 per cent.
Chinese borrowers have something of a stop-and-go track record in the
international bond markets. Spearheaded by the Bank of China and the China
International Trust &amp; Development Corporation (Citic), the list of borrowers
has expanded in recent years to include other banks, regional development
corporations and, most importantly, the finance ministry itself which raises
funds on behalf of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Chinese entities borrowed a total of Dollars 3.75bn in the year to date, up
from Dollars 3bn in 1993, Dollars 1.4bn in 1992 and Dollars 258m in 1991,
data compiled by Euromoney Bondware show.
After the resounding success of the PRC's debut in the Dragon bond market in
September 1993 with an issue of Dollars 300m of 10-year bonds, its fortunes
turned with the launch of a Dollars 1bn global bond offering in early
February. Priced at 85 basis points over Treasuries - even tighter than the
88-basis-point spread on the Dragon bond - it co-incided with the sharp
reversal in the global bull market in bonds, coming only two days before the
US Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the first time in the
current cycle.
This caused its yield spread to balloon out - some say to as much as 160
basis points over Treasuries - and soured investor sentiment towards Chinese
debt, making it more difficult for issuers to tap the markets in ensuing
months.
'The pricing on the PRC issue was too tight,' says Mr Michael Roche, head of
fixed income at HSBC Asset Management in Hongkong. He says he bought PRC
bonds at issue, held them during the sell-off and recently sold his position
at a small loss.
Some say investment banks' and rating agencies' eagerness to do business
with China has led them to compromise on the quality of that business. 'In
its quest to become bankers to China, the underwriting community has aimed
to please the issuer more than the investors - as reflected in the pricing
of the PRC issue,' says HSBC's Mr Roche. As far as Chinese issuers are
concerned, he adds, 'the rose is off the bloom, and we're staying away from
them.'
This, in addition to worries during the first half of the year over the
renewal of China's most favoured nation status, economic problems at home
and the dire performance of emerging market debt worldwide, pushed yield
spreads on Chinese issues out dramatically, causing subsequent fixed-rate
issues to be priced at a substantial premium over the underlying market.
A fixed-rate Yankee bond for Citic, issued on October 19, was priced at a
spread of 140 basis points over Treasuries. The PRC's global bond currently
trades at a spread of around 120 basis points over Treasuries.
Much of this year's issuance has also been in Japanese yen, where interest
rates have been less volatile than in the dollar block, and in floating rate
notes, which have made up some 20 per cent of borrowing by Chinese entities
this year.
Despite this year's difficulties, China is expected to persevere in its
efforts to raise international debt. One of the biggest borrowers in the
coming years is likely to be the finance ministry, which plans to raise some
Dollars 10bn internationally over the next five years.
The finance ministry will probably be joined by three new borrowers, the
so-called policy banks which China created this year: the State Development
Bank, the Agricultural Development Bank and the China Import and Export
Bank. They will gradually take over the country's centrally controlled
policy lending, allowing other banks to sharpen their commercial focus and
concentrate on commercial lending. The commercial banks, too, are expected
to gain controlled access to the international bond markets.
China's provinces are also expected to become bigger players in the
international arena. The trend towards political decentralisation has led to
a devolution of responsibility for infrastructure funding from the central
government to the provinces.
Although their access to overseas markets will remain controlled by the
central government, the provinces, through their financing agencies (often
referred to as 'Itics,' such as Shanghai-based Sitic and Guangzhou-based
Gitic) - are likely to increase their bond market profile.
Lastly, corporates who have been raising funds via international equity
offerings may also become bond market players. 'Partly privatised corporates
who have raised equity abroad will have a higher profile outside China and
this may enhance their capacity to borrow internationally,' says one
syndicate manager.
But will investor demand for Chinese paper rise in line with its supply?
Many investors remain daunted by some of the problems overhanging China,
including the overheating economy (11 per cent GDP growth expected this
year), galloping inflation (well over 20 per cent), massive government
subsidies to loss-making state-owned enterprises and fears over the
succession to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
'The market is definitely worried about run-away inflation, political risk
and double deficits,' says HSBC's Mr Roche, adding: 'the economic miracle
has turned into an economic mess.' In view of this, he feels that, 'relative
to its sovereign peer group, Chinese debt is overpriced.'
However, others say fears of economic and political chaos are overdone -
'some people pay too much attention to inflation and not enough to the
underlying economic picture,' says Lehman's Mr Taran, pointing to China's
dynamic export sector which has caused its current account deficit to shrink
sharply and underpins the country's debt servicing capacity. Moreover, its
high domestic savings rate (some 35 per cent of GDP) supports a high level
of domestic investment and means that China does not depend on foreign
funds.
On the political front, Mr Taran brushes aside worries over a return to the
dark ages of collectivism. 'Neo-Maoism is an absurd notion; after 16 years
of reform, it would be very difficult for China to go back,' he says. He is
sanguine as regards the eventual leadership succession: 'In my view, the
death of Deng Xiaoping will be a non-event from the bond market's
perspective; there is broad consensus among the leadership in China, and the
cement of that consensus is the drive towards modernisation.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (20): US reception remains cool - Chinese
stocks on Wall Street still lack appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
American consumer goods from burgers to fizzy drinks may be all the rage in
China, but not all things Chinese can be assured an equally warm reception
in US markets, as company and regulatory officials have learnt to their cost
this year.
US shareholders have broadly cold-shouldered mainland stock trading on Wall
Street and the so-called N share.
The N share is a recently introduced category of security offered to
investors in the US, Europe and Asia, and its reception has prompted the
Chinese regulatory authorities to look instead at facilitating dual primary
listings - as achieved by Shanghai Petrochemical and its sponsors Merrill
Lynch Hong Kong and Peregrine Capital last year.
This would enable companies to widen their investor base with a US listing,
while at the same time recognising that the bulk of demand, for now, will be
in Hong Kong.
In 1993, the first year of overseas listings, all nine selected companies
headed across the border for Hong Kong. This year, however, the Chinese
authorities elected to send five of the 22-strong second batch to New York.
For the companies concerned, this was initially seen as good news: compared
with Hong Kong, price/earnings ratios tend to be higher and there is a
perceived prestige premium attached to a US listing.
Until the introduction of N shares, which began with Shandong Huaneng, a
power company, four mainland companies were listed on the New York Stock
Exchange: Brilliance China, China Tire, Ek Chor Motorcycle and Shanghai
Petrochemical. In October, Huaneng Power, an associate company, became the
sixth US listed mainland company.
Trading in Shanghai Petrochemical, one of the first batch of N shares,
demonstrates the relative inactivity of China shares in the US vis a vis
Hong Kong, where most activity takes place. Around four times the volume of
Shanghai Petrochemical shares are traded in Hong Kong as in New York,
although 70 per cent of the stock was first issued in the US.
Bankers attribute this to Hong Kong's greater awareness of - and familiarity
with - the China market, as well as an its enhanced level of news about the
country, plus research coverage.
Most recently, the lacklustre American appetite for Chinese shares has been
highlighted by the decision by Shandong International Power Development
(SIPD) to delay its listing while it monitors the performance of shares in
the two power companies which recently hit Wall Street.
SIPD last month called a halt on its HKDollars 2.7bn listing in the colony,
and planned issue of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), in response to the
US performance of Shandong Huaneng and Huaneng Power International.
Poor performances wrought by market conditions have been exacerbated in the
Chinese power sector by a dearth of desperately-needed foreign funds for
development.
Shandong Huaneng has seen the price of its ADRs slump about 23 per cent from
the issue price of USDollars 14.25 on August 4 to about USDollars 11.25.
Huaneng Power International has also seen its share price fall on Wall
Street since its October 6 debut, despite cutting the share price 27 per
cent to USDollars 20 from USDollars 27.50, the top price mooted in the
preliminary listing prospectus.
In response to this, regulatory authorities are seeking to eliminate the
barriers to dual primary listings.
If measures can be developed in time, it is possible two of China's biggest
overseas listings now earmarked for New York may be able to dovetail with a
Hong Kong offering. These are the two airline companies: China Southern
Airlines, being brought to market by Goldman Sachs; and China Eastern
Airways, arranged by Morgan Stanley.
The challenge has been swiftly picked up by the Hong Kong stock exchange and
the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's securities
watchdog.
The colony's regulators are eager to enhance Hong Kong's international
reputation and obtain the extra business generated by offering a secondary
market in New York listed China companies.
However, facilitating dual primary listings means overcoming mechanical
problems such as those which arise, for example, because of the different
subscription systems used in the US and Hong Kong.
Issues to be resolved include who has jurisdiction in a simultaneous US-Hong
Kong listing; prospectus differences - in the US an initial 'red herring'
document is printed without prices while, in Hong Kong, prices are typically
included. Another issue is the underwriters' role in price stabilisation,
following a new listing.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (16): Changing the climate of ideas - The
country's central bank, the People's Bank of China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As China becomes a market economy, albeit a 'socialist' one, it needs a
proper central bank. What it has, instead, is the People's Bank of China. If
the latter is to become a less unsatisfactory institution, major reforms
must be made to its internal structure. But changes are needed still more to
the public finances, to the operation of local government and state-owned
enterprises, to the financial system and, not least, to the climate of ideas
about monetary policy.
According to World Bank calculations, China's consolidated fiscal deficit
has run at an average rate of between 5.2 and 6.2 per cent of gross domestic
product over the past seven years. Moreover, the PBC has been financing
about 60 per cent of this. In 1993, total gross lending by the PBC to the
financial system, largely for so-called 'policy-lending', reached 8.5 per
cent of GDP. While central bank financing on this scale is incompatible with
monetary stability, alternatives involve raising taxes, lowering spending,
or raising money in more costly ways.
Almost as important as the size of monetary financing is the loss of central
control over credit expansion, largely a result of administrative
decentralisation. Local government-led excess demand tends to be
accommodated by the expansion of planned credit ceilings, which leads, in
turn, to higher levels of PBC lending.
Because government (at all levels) is so dependent for financing on the
PBC's printing press, the authorities have also had to restrict the
financial liberalisation that would allow the emergence of more competitive
alternatives to cash and bank deposits. This, however, creates yet another
obstacle to central bank reform: the lack of sophisticated securities
markets, which would permit monetary policy to operate other than
disruptively, through overall credit ceilings.
This need to impose credit rationing is increased by the persistent tendency
to keep interest rates low. PBC loans are subsidised to different degrees
below the base interest rates for bank loans, themselves low. Moreover,
rates of interest tend to be furthest below inflation when the latter is
high, which is precisely when credit growth needs to be curbed. The
consequence is chronic excess demand for credit, exacerbated by the lack of
a credible bankruptcy constraint on state enterprises and local government
borrowers. It has been estimated that more than half of the PBC's loans are
not repaid.
In 1993, concern about overheating and excessive lending led to
centralisation of all authority for PBC lending and allocation of credit
quotas in Beijing. In a country as vast as China, however, such
centralisation must be temporary. When it is relaxed, so ineluctably is
monetary control.
Better monetary control and improved banking supervision depend on making
the state banks more autonomous and commercially minded. Similarly, monetary
policy will remain a blunt instrument, so long as China's financial markets
remain undeveloped. If that is to be allowed to change, however, public
finances must improve, which depends, in turn, on the success of current
fiscal reforms, on cleaning out the Augean stables of loss-making state
enterprises and on disciplining the 'investment hunger' of local government.
But before all else, people in authority need to appreciate the inflationary
risk of continued monetary financing of the consolidated budget. At present,
many policy-makers and analysts are not only insouciant about inflation, but
are unwilling to recognise its underlying monetary causes. The hope has to
be that they do not end up learning their lesson the hard way.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (17): Problem of revenue decline - Taxation
is one of the trickiest areas of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reform of China's system of taxation is - says Mr Xiang Huaicheng,
recently appointed vice-director of the State Administration of Taxation -
among the 'riskiest and most difficult' elements of China's reforms. It is
also among the most important.
In 1978, budgetary revenues were 34.4 per cent of China's gross national
product. By 1993, that had fallen to a mere 15.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the
central government's share of total budgetary revenues had fallen from 59 to
41 per cent, while its share of expenditures had fallen only from 46 to 41
per cent. Because of the lack of revenue, the government is forced to rely
on the printing press; because of the declining share of the central
government, it is also unable to redistribute revenue across China.
Much the most important cause of the declining trend in revenues was a
reduction in budgetary contributions from state-owned enterprises, from 20
per cent of gross domestic product in 1978 to a mere 4 per cent in 1992.
This accounted for over 80 per cent of the total decline in the share of
budgetary revenues in national income.
It was the intention of the reforms of the 1980s to leave enterprises with
greater control over their resources. Yet this also means that the Chinese
people are obtaining almost no return from the investments they have been
making in these enterprises. In 1993, for example, 23 per cent of GDP was
invested in state enterprises. Huge quantities of scarce resources are being
swallowed up, therefore, largely for the benefit of the 18 per cent of the
labour force that works within them.
Administrative decentralisation has also played a role. Hitherto, revenue
has been raised by locally responsible tax authorities and shared with the
centre through a complex contractual system. This has created incentives for
local governments to exempt local enterprises, at the expense of the centre.
Meanwhile, local governments have made up the lost revenues through levies
that they have not had to share with the centre. Such 'fiscal
extra-budgetary funds' have grown from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1978, to 4.2
per cent in 1993, and now account for a quarter of total budgetary
resources.
The decline of the centre's share in a fiscal revenue whose share in
national income is itself declining threatens not just the reform, but even
political and economic stability. The answer has been sought in a
comprehensive tax reform that was supposed to start at the beginning of
1994, but was, in fact, initiated in July.
The reform programme covers tax structure, tax administration and revenue
sharing. The number of taxes is being reduced from 30 to 18, the main
features being broadening and restructuring of the value-added tax (VAT), at
a rate of 17 per cent on most items, unification and restructuring of the
enterprise investment tax (EIT), at a single rate of 33 per cent, and
restructuring of the personal income tax. At the same time, the tax service
is being re-organised into a National Tax Service (NTS) and a Local Tax
Service (LTS). As of July, the NTS is expected to collect all central taxes
and shared taxes.
Under the new revenue-sharing arrangement, taxes are assigned either to the
centre, to local government, or shared. Of indirect taxes, VAT, the
securities trading tax and the resource tax are subject to sharing, while
customs duties and the new excise tax are assigned to the central
government.
Of direct taxes, revenues from the enterprise income tax on socially owned
companies are to go to the level of government that owns them (so continuing
the traditional socialist confusion between taxation and dividends). The
system has been designed to ensure that no province becomes worse off than
in 1993, but will favour the surplus and fast-growing provinces over the
deficit and slow-growing ones.
The World Bank estimates that central revenue collection would jump from 27
per cent of total taxes in 1992 to around 80 per cent; the central
government's share of the total revenue collected would increase from about
about 40 per cent of total revenue in 1992, to 52 per cent by the year 2000;
and the net transfer from central to local government would jump from minus
14 per cent of tax collection in 1992 to plus 35 per cent. There should,
therefore, be a significant increase in the leverage of the central
government over revenue and, thereby, over local government.
One question concerns the new NTS. Mr Xiang recognises the difficulty of
seizing effective control over his army of 580,000 tax officials in 4,000
offices. Much greater computerisation is required, with 50 cities to be
linked in this way next year.
The shortage of accountants is a concern. Another problem is the low pay of
tax inspectors, who earned only about Yn4,400 (USDollars 760) each in 1993,
which must encourage corruption. A survey of one city suggested that 13 per
cent of revenue was not collected, but Mr Xiang admits this could be a
significant under-estimate.
At least two other problems loom. First, that these reforms may not increase
overall revenue much, if at all. Additional sources of revenue may soon be
needed, the personal income tax being an obvious candidate for attention.
Second and more important, tax reform can, at best, solve only half the
fiscal problem. The other half is spending. There the problems of inadequate
overall control and unclear assignment of responsibility remain to be
solved, even in principle.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (15): Slow, painful progress - Banking and
financial reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the third plenary session of the 14th central committee of the Chinese
Communist Party approved sweeping reforms of the financial sector in
November 1993, the decision was hailed as a breakthrough.
Twelve months later it is clear that actual reform of the banking system
will prove painfully slow, and that it will be many years before China has
constructed a modern financial sector to match its growing economic weight
internationally.
One indication of the difficulties involved in pressing ahead with financial
reforms is the fact that the new Central Bank law is making
slower-than-expected progress through the review mechanisms of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress, some of whose deputies are wary
of plans to expand the bank's authority.
Discussion has focused on the role of a powerful monetary policy committee,
to be established under the law. Sections of the bureaucracy such as the
planning apparatus, which have been used to the People's Bank acting as a
milch cow for their needs, are nervous about proposals to increase its
independence. Among key elements of the new law is an end to the bank's
direct financing of the budget deficit.
Membership of the monetary policy committee will, of course, be crucial to
exerting continuing influence over the central bank as it becomes a more
independent institution under the planned financial sector reforms. The
People's Bank governor would be chairman, and members would come from
ministries as well as the central bank itself.
Last November's party plenum nominated three areas for the transformation of
the People's Bank into an institution that would, in theory, wield much the
same power as its counterparts in North America, Europe and Japan, though
under present circumstances it is difficult to envisage any Chinese
institution freeing itself from fairly pervasive political influence.
Under the plenum directive the People's Bank would first carry out
independent monetary policy to maintain a stable value of the currency and
to enforce financial regulations: in other words, lead the fight against
inflation. The monetary policy committee would lay down guidelines for
managing monetary and credit policy.
Secondly, gradual implementation of the reforms would see the replacement of
the credit plan by indirect instruments of monetary control such as interest
rates and open market operations. The latter has begun in limited fashion
through the trading of People's Bank bills on the Shanghai exchange.
Thirdly, it is proposed that regional 'suprabranches' of the central bank be
established to replace existing branches in provinces, cities and towns.
This streamlining and strengthening of the People's Bank supervisory
apparatus would be aimed at countering political influence at provincial
level, one of the main threats to central bank independence.
Other elements of financial sector reform endorsed by the party plenum
included the transformation of the specialised banks into commercial banks,
and also the conversion of rural and urban credit co-operatives into
small-scale banks serving the credit needs of small-to-medium-sized
enterprises and the local economy.
Finally, the plenum sanctioned the establishment of three policy banks to
separate policy lending from commercial lending, thus creating favourable
conditions for transforming the specialised banks into commercial banks.
China's big four specialised banks, which include the Industrial and
Commercial Bank (ICBC), the Agricultural Bank (ABC), the Bank of China
(BOC), and the People's Construction Bank (PCBC) are weighed down by policy
lending responsibilities, chief of which is an obligation to continue
propping up failing state enterprises.
The three new policy banks are the State Development Bank (SDB), responsible
for channelling long-term development credit to infrastructure and the
state's key industrial projects, the Agricultural Policy Bank (APB), and the
Export-Import Bank (EIB) whose mission is defined as lending to trade
projects guided by trade policy considerations.
In addition to the central bank law, a commercial bank law, the Banking Act,
is also in preparation. This would define the legal rights and obligations
of the specialised banks towards state enterprises, and in theory provide
these institutions with legal protection from being obliged to make 'policy'
loans to failing enterprises.
While the above constitutes an ambitious programme of reform, Chinese
officials themselves freely admit that the task is daunting. Not least of
the problems facing institutions like the People's Bank is the sheer numbers
of staff that would need to be shed before a meaningful rationalisation of
its activities could take place.
China's central bank employs 170,000 people in some 2,500 branches and
sub-branches spread across the country. Vast numbers of staff would become
redundant under a planned new computerised payments system (settlement
accounts held by commercial banks at city and county levels would be slashed
from 115,000 to 10,000), but it is not clear that the People's Bank is ready
to deal with the personnel upheavals that would be involved. The four
specialised banks, if they are ever to be transformed into commercial
institutions, face a similar problem, although of much greater magnitude.
China's 'big four' banks have a total of 120,000 branches and 1.3m
employees.
But far beyond the administrative barriers to reform of the specialised
banks is the overwhelming problem of their obligation to continue funding
ailing state enterprises. According to official estimates 20 per cent of
loans to state enterprises are non-performing (what the Chinese describe as
'problem' loans), but the truth is that no-one really knows.
An indication of the dimensions of the problem can be gleaned from the fact
that at the end of 1993, total loans of state banks amounted to Yn2,600
trillion, of which more than 70 per cent was working capital loans mostly to
state enterprises. Mr Tang Xu, director of the Graduate School of the
People's Bank, commented ruefully in a recent article: 'Some of the
enterprises are losing money and cannot repay loans on time, but the banks
have no means to force them to do so. Worse still, they often have to
increase loans to help maintain (political) stability . . . the balance
sheets of the banks, however, do not accurately reflect the situation and
may even record profits because of the accrued interest from these loans.'
China's World Bank advisers say that while progress in the reform of both
the operations of the central bank and the specialised banks will depend to
a large extent on stopping the haemorrhaging of state enterprises, glimmers
of promise lie in the fact that Chinese bankers now appear to have a better
understanding of what is required to deal with the problem.
But as with other developing countries China lacks the skilled manpower in
its regulatory agencies, such as the central bank, to monitor developments
and exercise control, especially at provincial and county level. A weakness
of the new central bank law is the lack of provision for the adequate
supervision of non-bank financial institutions such as trust and investment
companies, some of which are offshoots of the banks themselves. This is
clearly an unsatisfactory state of affairs. As a World Bank official says:
'Reforms of the financial sector still have a long, long way to go.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (11): Projects grow in size - Foreign
investment / US companies are increasing their involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER

<TEXT>
Foreign investors continued to pour funds into China in 1994 with actual
utilised investment in the first nine months rising to USDollars 22.72bn, up
49 per cent on the corresponding period last year.
But numbers of new foreign invested projects and the volume of contracted
investment declined after the frenzied activity of 1993 in which pledged
funds exceeded those for the previous 14 full years.
Numbers of new projects were down by 46 per cent to the end of September
compared with last year, and pledged investment dropped by about 32 per cent
to Dollars 57bn. This inevitable slowdown also corresponded with attempts by
the authorities to calm an overheating economy.
But the figures, nonetheless, are impressive. From 1979 - the year that
China opened its doors to foreign investors - to the end of September more
than 210,000 foreign-funded ventures were approved with pledged investment
of Dollars 275bn. Actual investment had reached Dollars 85.1bn
Ministry of foreign trade officials predict that utilised investment this
year will top Dollars 30bn compared with Dollars 26bn last year. This will
represent about half of all foreign direct investment to developing
countries worldwide, an indication of the strength of China's continuing
appeal to international investors.
But the figure could easily be much larger. Delays in resolving internal
arguments over the appropriate returns for investors in infrastructure
projects, especially power plants, is holding up at least half a dozen power
projects worth several billions of dollars in foreign investment.
According to electricity ministry officials, China will need to spend at
least Dollars 67bn on new power plants by the end of the century to lift its
generating capacity from the present 183,000 Mw to a targetted 300,000 Mw.
About one quarter of these funds would come from foreign investors.
The telecommunications industry is another that is set to increase sharply
its investment in China. The announcement last month that Hong Kong Telecom
would invest Dollars 260m in a fibre optic link from Hong Kong to Beijing
and a mobile telephone network in the Chinese capital is one of many
instances of planned telecommunications sector investment.
Motorola, AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Northern Telecom, Alcatel, Siemens and NEC all
have ambitious investment plans. Motorola, for example, will have invested
Dollars 300m by the end of this year in factories producing cellular phones,
paging systems and semi-conductors.
AT&amp;T, after a slow start, plans Dollars 150m in investment in the next two
years in nine joint ventures manufacturing such items as optical fibre
cable, switching gear and transmission equipment.
Consumer products companies are also in the vanguard of foreign investors.
Unilever, Procter and Gamble, General Electric and Electrolux have all
recently announced ambitious plans to target the household products and
appliance markets.
The petrochemicals and agri-chemicals sector is another that is poised to
increase significantly its stake in China. Among large foreign institutions
either involved in ventures on the ground or in negotiations are Aramco, the
Saudi Arabian state oil company, Shell, ICI, BP, Zeneca and Du Pont.
Automotive companies have also stepped up their efforts to secure a
foothold. Car giants, including Toyota, Ford and General Motors, are
jostling for a share of what promises to become - by early next century -
the world's biggest new market for passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
But for many foreign investors, large and small, involvement in China has
been a frustrating and, in many cases, expensive business. According to a
recent government survey, between one-third and one-half of foreign-funded
enterprises are loss-making in what is, by any standards, an extremely
difficult commercial environment.
A western embassy in Beijing in a report warns potential investors to beware
of what it describes as 'China factors' before committing themselves. These
include the parlous state of much of the country's infrastructure;
difficulties of arranging distribution and supply due to a crumbling
transport system; lack of convertibility of the yuan; bureaucratic
strictures that complicate personnel management; opaque rules and
regulations; and an unreliable legal system whose dispute-settling
mechanisms are loaded heavily against the foreign party.
But for all these problems it seems there will be no stopping, for the time
being, the 'stampeding herd.' High profile missions such as the one in
August led by Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary, in which some Dollars
6bn in contracts and letters of intent were initialled, tends to feed what
is known as 'China fever' among investors who perhaps lose sight of the
difficulties in their desire to become engaged.
Growing American business involvement on the ground in China is one of the
striking features of the past year or so, and this in turn is being
reflected in the investment figures with a distinct trend towards
larger-scale projects.
In the first eight month, the average investment in a single project was
Dollars 1.7m compared with Dollars 1.3m in the same period last year.
These figures also reflect the fact that whereas Hong Kong and Taiwanese
companies, many of which are involved in small-scale processing activities
such as textiles, dominated the field initially, it is now the
multinationals who are moving into China in a big way. Japanese companies,
which were initially wary, are part of this trend, along with the South
Koreans.
Among other factors responsible for the drop this year in numbers of
ventures and new pledged investment was the introduction of a new tax regime
on January 1. This imposed a capital gains tax on property transactions,
thus dampening real estate speculation. The new measures also ended the
practice of foreign funded ventures being allowed to import cars duty-free.
The latter 'privilege' had been widely abused with Chinese entrepeneurs
establishing companies using relatives or friends abroad as 'frontmen' to
enable them to import luxury cars, free of customs duty. The establishment
of thousands of such bogus enterprises had vastly inflated numbers of
so-called 'foreign- funded' joint ventures.
Apart from a trend towards larger projects, foreign investment also became
more widely distributed with inland provinces showing a bigger percentage
jump (from a low base) in new investment than coastal regions. According to
a study by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC),
provinces like Guizhou, Hubei and Gansu doubled numbers of overseas-funded
enterprises in the past year or so; although there remains a vast
development gulf between the coast and the hinterland.
After China's 15-year open door experiment what emerges from the latest
figures is the significant impact foreign-funded ventures are having on the
nation's trade.
In the first six months of this year imports and exports of these ventures
were up by 45 per cent over the same period last year to Dollars 35.78bn or
36.7 per cent of total trade. Exports reached Dollars 13.47bn, an increase
of 44.5 per cent over last year compared with a rise of about 30 per cent in
the national export figure.
This will be a pleasing result for the authorities who look to foreign
investment to boost exports.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (12): 'Wait - and you'll be too late' -
Multinational case study, Unilever in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprised by the success in Beijing of Unilever's face cream, a visiting
scientist recently asked a Chinese secretary at the Anglo-Dutch consumer
goods group's local subsidiary what people had previously used to protect
their skins against the very cold, dry winter winds.
She was stumped for the product's English word but wrote down its chemical
formula - 'Ah, glycerine]' said the scientist, grateful for the answer and
impressed by the secretary's scientific training.
Although Unilever and other multinationals are finding good staff, finding
enough is a problem and the main limiting factor affecting Unilever's
Chinese rate of expansion. 'We couldn't grow any faster if we wanted to,'
says a senior executive.
Starting with a handful of people in China a decade ago, Unilever has
enjoyed one of the fastest growth rates of any foreign company in China. The
700 people it employed two years ago have reached 2,500 today, of whom only
80 are ex-patriates.
The local employees range from production workers to more than 50 recent
university graduates who, like the secretary, are being drawn rapidly into
the multinational's management training programmes in China and abroad.
From first contacts with Chinese authorities in the early 1980s, the company
moved in the mid-1980s to negotiating joint ventures and finally to
investing Dollars 9m in its first three projects in the late 1980s.
Today, Unilever has eight joint ventures running or planned, with Dollars
200m of investment spent or committed. A further Dollars 100m will be spent
each year for the next five years, it announced recently on the eve of
opening an ice-cream factory in Beijing.
China is 'top of the list' of Unilever's target emerging economies, says Mr
Morris Tabaksblat, the group's Dutch co-chairman.
The group expects its Chinese sales to rise from Dollars 200m a year to
Dollars 1.5bn in 1999. It declines to discuss current profitability but 'we
should see good returns by the end of the decade,' says Mr Alexander Kemner,
head of Unilever's East Asia and Pacific region.
Like some other multinationals, Unilever's Chinese roots go back many years.
Lever Brothers, its British arm, built a factory in Shanghai in the early
1920s. It became China's largest maker of soap for laundry and personal use
but operations were nationalised in 1951.
During the 35-year hiatus until it re-established itself in China,
Unilever's plant was used by state enterprises and its famous Lux brand lay
dormant.
Its first joint-venture in 1987 took it back to the old Lever Brothers site
but to a different factory in the complex. The venture, Shanghai Lever, is
owned 54.5 per cent by Unilever, 40.5 per cent by the Shanghai Soap Factory
and 5 per cent by the Shanghai Daily Chemicals Corporation.
The venture is a factory within a factory. Part of the soap factory was
cleared, and re-equipped with the most modern machinery to make Lux toilet
soap. The product range has grown to include shampoos, shower creams, fabric
softeners and kitchen/bathroom cleaners.
The other two ventures in Unilever's first phase were Shanghai van den Bergh
(an equal joint venture with a local partner) to produce edible fats, mainly
for baking and ice cream, and Shanghai Pond's (also equally split) making
skin creams and lotions under the Pond's and Vaseline brands.
Gaining experience in these projects, it has moved on to five more ventures
in detergents, toothpaste, ice-cream and tea. It has taken a bigger stake in
each successive business to a maximum of 85 per cent in its Beijing
ice-cream factory. It says, however, that there will long be a need for a
local partner to help guide ventures through the bureaucratic maze.
Some foreign companies say they have been happy to leave their partners to
solve problems, such as unreasonable demands from local suppliers and
officials. The solution varies but can sometimes require payments. Unilever
says it has found no such problems but has drawn heavily on its partners'
local expertise for other purposes.
Difficulties abound in virtually all aspects of the businesses from raw
material supplies and transport to marketing and sales: price increases on
some local raw materials have made imports cheaper; it can take three weeks
to ship finished goods 1,000km from Shanghai to Beijing; TV adverts have to
be produced abroad and sent to some 300 individual stations; copy for print
campaigns has to be sent to each of hundreds of newspapers and magazines.
It can also take up to six months to get a price increase approved by
officials; distribution systems are product-specific so Unilever cannot, for
example, send soap via its toothpaste distributor; reform of the
government-dominated retailing system is only just beginning; and
western-style advertising, marketing and management concepts have to be
taught from basic levels.
But for Unilever, the over-riding importance is to be in China building its
experience, knowledge, brands and business - 'if you waited until the risks
in China were lower, then you would simply be too late,' says Mr Anton
Lenstra, chairman of Unilever China.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (13): An open door to opportunities -
Manufacturing case study, Pilkington's joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for companies across the
whole range of industrial activity, from automobiles to telecommunications
and beyond. One company that has done better than most in laying down roots
in China is Pilkington, the UK-based glass maker.
Pilkington was one of the first western companies to walk through China's
'open door,' pushed ajar by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, in 1979.
In 1983 the company signed a joint venture agreement to install China's
first 'float glass' manufacturing plant using Pilkington's technology. By
1988 the 5,000 tonnes a week plant was in production.
Located in Shanghai's Pudong special economic zone, Shanghai Yaohua
Pilkington Glass (SYP), is in the enviable position of not being able to
produce enough glass to meet demand. Since 1989, SYP has made a profit after
interest and dividends; last year it was listed on the Shanghai bourse, fast
becoming one of the most highly-rated listed companies in China.
Mr Zhang Sanfu, the company's managing director, is now one of the most
sought-after executives in China by western investment bankers. In September
he was in the US speaking at a conference organised by Merrill Lynch, the US
securities house. While there, he took soundings about the possibility of
raising capital to expand his glass works.
The company is already adding a second 'float line,' which will have
capacity to produce 2,500 tonnes a week of glass mainly for the automotive
industry. It is due to begin production in October 1995. Mr Zhang wants to
add a third float line (capacity 3,500 tonnes a week) soon after the second
line is completed.
Pilkington retains an 8.35 per cent in SYP, having being diluted from its
original 12.5 per cent at the time of the company's flotation last year. The
UK company maintains a close relationship with SYP in Shanghai and is keen
to develop its business in other industrial centres in China.
'It is fairly logical for us to look at China,' says Mr Terry Ginty,
vice-president Asia Pacific. 'The market is growing and there are
significant opportunities.'
Mr Ginty says that Pilkington's strategy in China is simple and
opportunistic - 'you can't have a hard-and-fast policy. You have to have a
feel for opportunities and take them when they come along. It's a big
market. But in general our strategy is to look for manufacturing
opportunities where there isn't a strong local glass maker.'
The first opportunity the company took up was to partner Taiwan Glass in a
venture in Qingdao. Taiwan Glass has been a partner of Pilkington's for more
than 20 years and when it decided to invest in a float glass plant in
Qingdao, Shandong province, it asked Pilkington to join it. The UK company
has taken a 10 per cent interest in the plant.
The Qingdao investment, however, was more by way of a favour to a
long-standing customer and friend. What Pilkington really wants to do in
China is to take larger and larger stakes in ventures targeted at the
automotive glass industry and the market for flat glass more generally. It
is actively scouting sites in China to expand its activities in float glass.
This year it has signed two joint venture agreements, one in Changchun,
Jilin province, and another in Wuhan, Hebei province, which has given it 35
per cent of the former venture and 45 per cent of the latter. Both are in
automotive glass.
In Changchun, Pilkington's partner is Changchun Tempering Glass Company and
the venture will supply automotive glass to the First Auto Works. This state
company assembles Audi 100s for German car manufacturer, Volkswagen and
additionally has a joint venture with VW to produce the company's Jetta
sedan. Phase one envisages output of 150,000 Jetta cars, rising to 300,000
after the implementation of phase two.
Pilkington's other partner is SYP which owns 23 per cent of the joint
venture company - 'it is looking for vertical integration,' says Mr Ginty,
who is also deputy chairman of SYP. The glass plant will have capacity
initially for 200,000 sets of auto glass. 'They (the VW joint venture) will
probably look for two suppliers,' he says. 'Traditionally, one takes about
70 per cent of the production and the other, 30 per cent. We aim to be the
prime supplier. We're confident that we can earn that position.'
The second foray into automotive glass - the joint venture in Wuhan - is
similar to the first. The foreign car marker this time is Citroen, and
planned output levels are identical to the VW venture: 150,000 Citroen ZX
model sedans in the first phase, rising to 300,000 in the second.
What is different is that Pilkington has effective control, with 45 per cent
of the equity - 'we wanted to get the feel of majority ownership and run the
company,' says Mr Ginty. 'With Changchun, we couldn't get a majority - the
value of the existing assets decided the equity shares. In Wuhan it was a
matter of negotiation.'
The main partner here is China Yaohua Glass Company, the oldest glass maker
in China. But, as with the Changchun venture, SYP has a stake in the company
as well. 'Equity as such doesn't mean a lot in a joint venture,' says Mr
Ginty. 'If you can't work together, you wouldn't be in the venture in the
first place.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (14): Moving into sharper focus -
Conglomerate profile, Citic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As China International Trust and Investment Corporation, (Citic), approaches
its 15th anniversary, it has decided the time has come to get back to
basics, writes Simon Holberton.
'We are trying to narrow the spectrum of our investments,' says Mr Wei
Mingyi, Citic's chairman. 'We have a guideline for our subsidiaries - never
open a restaurant again.'
That is a reference is to a prohibition on unrelated investments, no matter
how attractive they may appear to be. For Citic the management theme now is
'focus' and the agenda is crowded with large developments on the China
mainland, including port development, power generation, real estate and
telecommunications.
In addition to sharpening its focus, Citic's Beijing management is also
tightening controls, especially those applying to investment - 'we have more
than 30 subsidiaries and we can't control each and everyone,' says Mr Wei.
'But we can control each project. When any of (the subsidiaries) want to
invest more than Yn3m they have to be referred to Beijing. We co-ordinate
all the large projects.'
Taking pride of place among these developments is the transformation of
Daxie Island, situated to the south of Ningbo port and offering access to
China's industrial heartland in the Yangtze river delta. Citic plans to
invest Dollars 500m seed capital in the project.
China's premier conglomerate is looking, however, for Dollars 3bn to Dollars
6bn from foreign investors to turn the dream of a 31 sq km industrial park,
supporting a container port the size of that in Hong Kong, into a reality.
Citic recently entered into a joint venture with Bechtel, the US
construction company, to provide marketing, operations and services for the
island development.
This month, Mr Wei expects a floating bridge connecting Daxie with the
mainland to be finished - 'we will also begin construction of a temporary
dock - with the capacity to handle 20,000 tonnes vessels - so that transport
of equipment and cargo can be handled much more easily,' he says.
Already, overseas businessmen from Singapore and Hong Kong have indicated a
willingness to invest in the island. In August, a large mission from Japan,
consisting of banking and industrial executives, visited the island. Mr Wei
says Citic has signed its first business contract with an industrial company
in the chemicals industry.
Telecommunications is also a sector where Citic sees growth. AsiaSat 2, a
telecommunications and entertainment satellite, is due for launch in 1995.
Citic has a third of the project.
'We are trying to get Chinese television networks to make use of the
satellite,' he says.
He hopes that Central TV, the main government-owned national broadcaster,
will rent a transponder. AsiaSat 2 will employ 'Ku band' transponders which
are more powerful than the previous generation of transmitters. This means
that households need only own a small receiving dish - which Citic has the
capacity to manufacture in Beijing, Xian, and elsewhere.
'There are so many isolated and mountainous regions in China,' he explains.
'The peasants have the money (to buy a dish); the economy in many rural
areas is catching up. They need a communication channel that is clear and
stable.'
Citic may have been mainland China's first experiment with capitalism but
its pursuit of profit has been tempered recently by the government's request
that it take over and manage two ailing state companies - a civilian truck
and auto parts complex in Shaanxi, and a heavy machinery manufacturer in
Luoyang.
The re-organisation of the Shaanxi factories - 10 in all - is still not
complete. Citic has pumped about Yn50m into the complex over the past four
years; seven factories have returned to health - 'the other three need
money,' says Mr Wei. 'But Citic is not going to put any more money in, the
other seven can.'
Although he is not best pleased with the Shaanxi complex, he recognises that
there was a social need for Citic to help.
'They have more than 10,000 workers and their families, so 40-50,000 depend
on the factory,' he says.
The rehabilitation of most of the Shaanxi factories has enabled the creation
of Citic Automobile, a subsidiary which brings together Citic auto assets
under one umbrella.
The requirements of the Luoyang acquisition were managerial not monetary.
The factory, now known as Citic Heavy Machinery Company, is China's biggest
producer of heavy cranes, diggers, and dock loading equipment.
The factory was basically profitable, but the plant was under-utilised and
the company focused too much on domestic sales to the exclusion of export
possibilities.
'The company was owned previously by the mining industry, but it did not
order very much equipment,' he says. 'It was a big factory with a small
sales staff and no one to look after the overseas market. We have helped
them to export.'
Still, one gets the impression that Mr Wei does not see Citic's involvement
in 'pastoral care' for ailing state industries as central to the
conglomerate's mission.
In answer to another question about finance for state companies, he says:
'We do lend to state enterprise - carefully, very carefully.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (13): Weekend
still a problem for hotels - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks
at different parts of the regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotel and catering business across the region is picking up as the economy
moves out of recession.
'Sales are moving forward for everyone,' said Mr Clive Stone, managing
director of Redcliffe Catering. For Birmingham, he puts the increase in
business, compared with 1993, at up to 7 per cent during the first nine
months of the year.
'In the last six to nine months, we have seen a general upturn and a
strengthening of bookings, and that seems to be spreading to advance
bookings,' Mr Stone said.
But the advance is off a low base. There was a surge of hotel building in
Birmingham during the late 1980s and early 1990s - just in time for the
recession. Birmingham Marketing Partnership's hotel-occupancy figures for
1993, covering eight city-centre hotels, showed an average occupancy rate of
56.42 per cent.
Although mid-week business is described by Mr Stone as 'reasonably good',
Birmingham hotels face the perennial problem of finding weekend occupants.
Moreover, hoteliers are forced by immediate market conditions to offer
keener prices than their peers in London and Edinburgh.
Yet the underlying conditions are sound. According to Department of National
Heritage figures, based on the number of staying visits, Birmingham is the
fourth most visited city in the UK after London, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
The region has its share of tourist attractions, including Shakespeare at
Stratford-upon-Avon; Ironbridge, the birthplace of the Industrial
Revolution, in Shropshire; and the Alton Towers theme park.
But the main aim of policymakers since the 1970s has been to build up the
regional services sector. There has been extensive public-sector investment,
both in the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre
and the National Indoor Arena; and also in the growth of a cultural sector
based on the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the inward migration
of the Birmingham Royal Ballet and the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Yet the pattern of future development is difficult to predict. 'There is
nervousness about long-term capital investment,' suggested Mr Stone. 'There
is no problem for the next one to three years. The concern is three to 15
years out.'
In his view - which is not unique - the key to future growth in the sector
is: first, the continued development of Birmingham Airport and the
NEC-ICC-NIA complex; and second, a substantial tourist attraction to draw in
daily visitors.
The distribution-hotels-catering category of employment is already one of
the three largest in the West Midlands, accounting for 21 per cent of jobs.
Birmingham Economic Information Centre forecasts a growth in sectoral output
of over 30 per cent by 2005.
PROFILE: Solihull Moat House is the only 4-star hotel in Solihull, the town
nearest to the National Exhibition Centre. But, unlike the Metropole, which
is adjacent to the NEC and drawing much of its business from the centre, the
Moat House depends on local business.
'The majority of our customers are local privileged people on contract
rates,' said Mr Brian Dunn, the manager. 'To get a consistent base through
the year, we prefer to deal with local companies.' He had in mind groups
such as British Gas and Lucas.
As such companies undertake more training courses, so they bring their
employees into the hotel. Like the hotels in Birmingham, the Solihull Moat
House has seen business pick up this year. But, said Mr Dunn, 'the growth is
not in occupancy volume but more in price'.
The hotel has 115 bedrooms, and is currently running on a 72 per cent
occupancy rate. This opens up the possibility of hardening the rates charged
to customers. 'At a top-class hotel, the challenge is getting the rate. A
4-star hotel could (be filled) every day if it charged the same as a 3- or
2-star: it would be just offering better service for less,' said Mr Dunn.
It is an indication of the recovery in the sector that, as Mr Dunn put it:
'The whole market is beginning to firm up and we can firm rates up. It's
like the aircraft business. If BA has seats available, then there are more
offers available.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (12): Financial
services expands again - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks at
different parts of the regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT

The regional financial services community, centred on Birmingham, reports
increasing business. Mr Peter Willis, chief executive of Birmingham City
2000, which acts as an umbrella group for the sector, says some firms are
considering whether to resume recruitment.
'Activity levels are rising. Part of (the reason) is that there's a huge
backlog of projects which have been shelved over the past four years,' he
explained.
Ernst &amp; Young, accountants, said its management consultancy activities had
increased by 30 per cent over the past year. 3i, the largest venture capital
group in the UK, reported that, in the West Midlands, it had invested more
during the first half of 1994 than in the whole of 1993.
There is increased activity, too, among solicitors. Eversheds declared a 5
per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 16m at its Birmingham office during
the year to April, and observed that the increase was accelerating this
year. Edge &amp; Ellison said its business was running 15 per cent ahead of last
year, although there was pressure on margins.
The financial services community in Birmingham has started to grow again.
During the recession some of the London merchant banks withdrew. Now, Henry
Ansbacher has arrived. BWD Rensburg has joined the ranks of the
stockbrokers, a small community where the leading operator is Albert E
Sharp.
In spite of the revival, the main preoccupation of the financial services
community is to keep regional business within the region. 'Once an initial
transaction has gone to London, there is much less opportunity for the local
financial community to service it,' said Mr Willis.
Flows of business are difficult to monitor, but there appears to have been
some success in stopping business drifting to London. 'There have been a
load of management buy-outs in the last five years which would have been
done in London before,' said Mr Digby Jones, deputy senior partner of Edge &amp;
Ellison.
There have also been some highly publicised transactions using wholly West
Midlands services - for example, the arrangement by Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
accountants, of the Leyland Daf Vans management buy-out from the receiver in
1993.
That also showed how accountants have been moving into the market gap left
by the merchant banks.
The difference between Birmingham and the much larger London financial
services community is that the latter has a life of its own. Birmingham does
not.
Manufacturing, said Mr Willis, is absolutely vital: 'We cannot get away from
the fact that the skills of the West Midlands are transferring materials
into products. That is the core of financial services activity. Other things
become important adjuncts to that.'
Growth of the sector thus becomes a matter of preventing local business from
going elsewhere and developing an international approach to business, which
ties in with the more export-oriented manufacturing companies. 'We could be
a professional stepping-stone for those who want to do business in Europe.
Why should London be the only stepping-stone?' asked Mr Willis.
PROFILE: 3i. The venture capital group invested Pounds 26m in West Midlands
companies during the year to March, and now Mr Chris Rowlands, the regional
director, reports increased business.
Buy-in and buy-out activity has continued strongly in 1994. Demand for
expansion capital, mainly from companies seeking to make acquisitions has
also been growing, 3i reports.
Alongside this corporate activity, the demand for 3i funds from existing
companies, to assist expansion, has been sluggish.
Mr Rowlands said that, in the late 1980s, about 40 per cent of 3i funding
had gone into such projects. Now, it was more like 20 per cent.
He has noticed another difference. 'Over the last 18-24 months, there has
been a significant change in the way the mid-size corporate deals - for
companies with turnovers between Pounds 15m and Pounds 50m - are being done.
'Predominantly, they are being handled by regional professionals. What are
organisations going to do if they are based only in London?'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (11): Engineers
point way out of recession - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks
at different parts of the regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineering companies across the region have been reporting fatter
order-books during the past three quarters. There is more optimism than at
any time since 1990.
'Companies were very nervous at the start, but latterly it seems to be
generally accepted that business in most sectors has improved considerably,'
said Mr David Botterill, chief executive of the Engineering Employers'
Federation West Midlands.
But recovery is by no means uniform. The leading performers have been the
automotive and the electronic sectors. The laggards have been companies tied
into the aerospace and construction industries.
Thus, on one hand, Rover reported a 9 per cent increase in volume sales over
the first three quarters of the year, and announced the recruitment of 1,450
new staff; and Lucas Automotive reported a 13 per cent increase in sales for
the year to last July.
On the other hand, Lucas Aerospace also reported difficult conditions in the
aerospace markets, and predicted little improvement until 1995-96, while
smaller groups active in the sector, such as Hampson Industries and
TransTec, saw their profits deteriorate.
Mr Botterill noted that, in the electronics sector, performance was strong
where sales related to the automotive industry or to machine tools and
investment equipment. Significantly, in that context, production this year
at Cincinnati Milacron, the machine tool maker in Birmingham, has been
running at double the rate of 1993. But in the consumer electronics sector,
the performance has not been so strong.
Despite the overall improvement in the performance of the sector, immediate
problems remain. Pressure on margins remains very tight. 'In the third year
of recovery, margin replenishment has not gone as far as one would have
expected,' said Mr Botterill. Indeed, customers are resisting price rises,
and manufacturers are being forced to absorb increases in raw material
prices.
More fundamentally, the pressure on the original equipment manufacturers to
reduce the number of their component suppliers, most noticeably in the
automotive and aerospace sectors, is resulting in continuing rationalisation
among component makers as they strain to retain their competitive position.
The West Midlands is acutely sensitive to such changing commercial patterns.
This follows from the structure of manufacturing, the heart of which is in
Birmingham.
'There is a marked specialisation in a narrow range of inter-linked
engineering industries, specialising in the production of motor vehicles,
investment goods and associated components and materials,' noted the
Birmingham Economic Information Centre (BEIC).
This concentration did not serve the city well in the 1980s when growth was
rapid in sectors such as computer hardware, pharmaceuticals, aerospace,
plastics and electronics. More recently, restructuring has tended to
concentrate on the introduction of new technology, which, in turn, has
eliminated more basic metal-bashing.
Over the past two years, the engineering sector has underpinned the movement
out of recession. BEIC predicts, between now and the year 2005, annual
growth rates of more than 3 per cent in the city's production of metal
goods, more than 6 per cent in electrical, electronic and instrument
engineering, and more than 4 per cent in motor vehicles.
'We need a long period of low inflation, consequent low interest rates and
sustainable levels of investment,' said Mr Botterill.
PROFILE: Grove Industries. The acquisitive group, based in
Stratford-upon-Avon and run by Mr David Groves, is looking for engineering
companies to add to its collection of interests in press work, machined
components and injection moulding.
The group, which this year will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2m on
turnover of Pounds 40m, is half owned by Close Brothers, the London merchant
bank and half by Mr Groves. Close uses Grove as a vehicle for its investment
in manufacturing.
Like its peers, Grove is finding trading conditions easier but not easy.
'The economy is quite buoyant. There's a lot of pressure on margins. In the
past when the UK started to generate growth of 3 per cent, then companies
were able to push prices up and enhance margins. That is not happening at
the moment,' Mr Groves said.
'I see varying signs of inflation. I see a labour situation where there is a
shortage of skilled labour and managerial talent. There's also a significant
increase in raw material prices, especially over the last six months,' he
added, noting polypropylene price increases of 25 per cent and paper and
board increases of 20 per cent.
As a sub-contractor, Grove is intent on building long-term relations with
the systems makers. 'We've developed technical teams whereby they are able
to help with re-engineering the products and reducing the costs.' It is the
key to staying in the game. 'We want to be involved with design, work
alongside, make them more reliant on us, as we are on them.'

Distribution survives the downturn - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright
looks at different parts of the regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business parks are being developed or considered right across the West
Midlands - in urban and rural areas, along the M6 and the M42, and at the
northern ends of the M5 and the M40.
The region, at the centre of England and within easy reach of big
concentrations of population, has provided a firm base for certain types of
property investment. Geographically, it is convenient. It has not been
subject to the same sharp movements of, for example, the London office
market. This steadiness has not escaped London investment managers.
'Distribution and warehousing markets in the West Midlands have proved to be
relatively recession-proof,' said Mr Andrew Nesbitt, property director of
AXA Equity &amp; Law Investment Managers. 'Demand for space has remained
constant, and supply has stayed tight.'
This may not be the case in future. Jones Lang Wootton, chartered surveyors,
has estimated that around 20 motorway junctions within 25 miles of
Birmingham there are 1,500 acres of land for which planning permission to
establish distribution parks exists or is being sought.
This could translate into between 22m and 25m square feet of built space,
according to Mr Dick Harvey, in charge of JLW's Birmingham office. 'That's a
lot of space. With low inflation, you have to get the product and the
location right to get it away,' he said.
By comparison with south-east England, land prices are modest, between
Pounds 200,000 and Pounds 250,000 an acre in the Birmingham area. And rents,
said Mr Andrew Jackson, industrial property specialist at Weatherall Green &amp;
Smith, are not really moving: 'They stay fairly flat at the moment, which is
a function of the available space. But that is getting absorbed steadily.'
He quoted rents of Pounds 4.50-Pounds 5.00 a square foot along the M42,
Pounds 4.00-Pounds 4.50 in Birmingham and Pounds 3.50-Pounds 4.00 in the
Black Country. They had been at these levels for at least two years, but
'for existing buildings, the level of incentives is starting to fall and
that is the first sign of rents beginning to rise.'
In any case, for new property, leasing arrangements will have to reflect the
higher construction costs which are emerging as raw-material prices rise
from levels depressed by the recession.
Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, noted: 'Demand for design-and-build
units is increasing across the Midlands from local industrialists, but 60
per cent of warehouse demand currently comes from third-party contract
distribution companies seeking only 5-10 year leases.'
Given that the development of the West Midlands distribution sector has
gathered pace over the past 10 years, this points to changing patterns of
demand for space.
'On the warehousing side, the move towards a more efficient form of
distribution was led by retailers,' explained Mr Jackson. 'But in recent
years there has been an increasing number of manufacturers who have been
taking space. If they are able to hold stock more efficiently, they can save
money, because they'll hold less of it - but also their customers want them
to provide much quicker delivery times.'
PROFILE: Hams Hall is an old power station site which is now the location
for a rail freight terminal and business-distribution park on the grand
scale.
'It is the largest by miles of any such project which can be built over the
next few years,' claimed Mr Alan Winter, managing director of Trafalgar
House Properties.
The site is owned by PowerGen, which has a joint venture with Trafalgar
House to provide the infrastructure. The joint venture will then sell land
for development. 'We are not going to build speculative space,'said Mr
Winter.
Powergen's land is close both to the junction of the M6 and M42, and to the
railway network on the east side of Birmingham at Coleshill. There are 380
acres, which offer the possibility of about 5.5m square feet of business and
distribution space in addition to the rail freight terminal.
The project provides an example of the way in which redundant industrial
land is being transformed through alternative uses.
Mr Winter does not expect to sign any deals with potential occupiers until
work on the site has started next year. But the interest is coming primarily
from West Midlands industrial companies. Theoretically, the first freight
train could run into Hams Hall in 1996, he said.
Whatever happens with the privatisation of British Rail, Hams Hall goes
ahead. It is probably running slightly ahead of a similar project on a
greenfield site near Daventry. 'If both schemes are up and running, they do
compete,' Mr Winter acknowledged.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (10): The roar of the dragon - City Profile,
Shanghai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shanghai was opened up to the outside world some 10 years later than other
coastal areas, such as Guangdong and Fujian. But China's largest city, with
a population of close to 13m, is desperately striving to make up for that
lost time.
According to the official statistics, the city's gross domestic product has
been rising, in real terms, at almost 15 per cent a year over the past three
years. If growth were to be sustained at this rate, Shanghai's economic
activity would double every five years. Already the richest place in China,
it looks almost certain to be the first significant part of that vast
country (apart from Hong Kong) to attain developed status.
Shanghai's recent dynamism represents a marked change from the 1980s, when
Shanghai was kept on a chokingly tight rein by a central government
dependent upon it for more than half its revenue. Between 1985 and 1991,
Shanghai's real income stagnated, while those of Guangdong and Fujian more
than doubled. But the decision to loosen the reins was finally taken at the
highest levels of a government that contains many officials from the city.
Now it is talked of as 'the dragon head' of the Yangtse river basin, home to
more than 300m people.
Construction is everywhere, with work continuing day and night. An official
publication, Shanghai Today, writes of 5,000 constructions sites.
The statistics on Shanghai's dynamism are as impressive as the visible signs
of activity. They have evidently impressed potential foreign investors. Last
year 3,650 foreign investment projects were approved for a total investment
of Dollars 7bn, according to Wang Zu Kang, chairman both of Shanghai's
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission and of its Foreign
Investment Commission. (The first director of the latter was, he notes, Zhu
Rongji, now China's senior vice-premier in charge of economic reform). In
the first nine months of 1994, a further 3,000 projects have been approved,
for a nominal value of Dollars 7.7bn. Two-thirds of all the projects
approved for Shanghai since 1988 have, in fact, been approved since the
beginning of 1993.
The aim of Mr Wang's commission is, he says, to provide 'one stamp, one
bridge, one window and one station' for foreign investors. This seems to
work. Shanghai is already, notes Mr Wang, home to investments (mostly joint
ventures) by almost 140 leading multinationals, including Volkswagen, AEG
and BASF of Germany, Pilkington of the UK, General Electric of the US and
Philips of the Netherlands. The VW joint venture produces 100,000 cars a
year and is, he says, expected to produce 200,000 soon.
The question that must occur to any visitor is where cars that end up in
Shanghai will fit. The biggest disadvantage of the city, apart from the
relatively high cost of land, is the creaking infrastructure. Shanghai is
choking. In rush hour, for example, it can take two hours to drive from
Pudong to the Bund, the celebrated area of old Shanghai on the Huangpu
river.
In response, the municipal and central governments have invested Yn20bn
(Dollars 2.3bn) in large projects in the past three years. There are now 10
more, while investment is running at Yn20bn a year. The authorities
recognise the scale of the required investment and hope foreign investors
will help fill the gaps. Investments include two completed bridges, an
overhead inner ring-road, an outer ring road, a port, a new airport, new
power plants and a new underground. Most important of all, in Pudong, across
the river from old Shanghai, a new economic zone with an area of 522 sq km
is being constructed. It already contains 4,000 industrial enterprises with
400,000 workers.
Yet the city possesses advantages along with the drawbacks, now being
partially remedied. It is, for example, China's principal port, with exports
and imports of Dollars 12.7bn last year. It is also the country's financial
capital, hosting the dynamic stock market and the still newer foreign
exchange market, established only in April of this year.
Shanghai contains China's largest reservoir of skilled labour. It has 50
colleges and universities, with a total enrolment of more than 120,000
students and 1,600 research and development institutes. Foreign employers
praise the technical skills available, although skilled office staff is
scarce.
A particular concern - says Dr Hans Geelhaar, general manager of Shanghai
Gao-BASF Dispersions - is a shortage of people who combine English with
knowledge of modern accounting and finance. Employees used to traditional
practices can also prove somewhat reluctant to take responsibility and
display initiative.
Inevitably, Shanghai has the problems of any old and long neglected city
attempting rapid economic growth. But this particular old city has huge
potential. Great difficulties lie ahead: some of the speculative building
is, for example, certain to prove a mistake. But there is no mistaking
either the energy of the people or the determination of the authorities. As
befits the head of the dragon, Shanghai is roaring.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (9): Foreign investors spur exports - The
turnaround in China's trade performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China, in the first nine months of 1994, registered a marked turnaround in
its trading performance with exports growing much faster than imports. To
the end of September exports exceeded imports by Dollars 1.38bn compared
with last year's trade deficit of Dollars 12.2bn.
Not only does this reverse last year's slowing of export growth, but the
figures also reveal that foreign-funded enterprises are leading the way in
generating exports. This is in line with the government's foreign investment
strategy aimed at using foreign funds to build a strong exporting base.
In the first six months of the year exports of foreign-funded enterprises
(which include wholly foreign-owned and joint ventures) leapt by about 45
per cent over the same period last year, and are now running at one-third of
China's total exports. For the nine months to September, exports increased
by 29.7 per cent over last year to Dollars 79.44bn. Imports reached Dollars
78.06bn in the nine months, growing by 15.2 per cent. This compares with
import growth last year of about 30 per cent.
The export surge has been attributed partly to the unification on January 1
of the Chinese yuan resulting in an effective 50 per cent devaluation and
partly to China's economic stabilisation programme introduced in July last
year which squeezed opportunities at home, making external markets more
attractive.
Chinese trade officials have also been encouraged by the changing
composition of exports. Miao Fuchun, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), noted that in the first six months
of this year the 'export mix continued to improve as demonstrated by further
expansion of the proportion of exports of manufactured goods.'
These now account for 83 per cent of total exports, an increase of 3
percentage points over the previous year. Exports of machinery and
electronics items continue to grow strongly and comprise a bigger proportion
of total exports at 24.8 per cent for the half-year compared with 23.6 per
cent for the same period last year.
In this new phase of its economic development China is seeking to encourage
growth of higher technology investment at the expense of low technology
industrial processing which provides low returns and is a drain on scarce
energy resources.
While China's trading performance has taken a sharp turn for the better this
year, it is the wider issues of trade reform and Beijing's application to
re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that have preoccupied
trade officials. At home, China introduced its first-ever 'Foreign Trade
Law' on July 1 and abroad its officials were enmeshed in difficult
negotiations on Gatt entry. The new foreign trade law is in part China's
answer to Gatt-related criticism of a lack of transparency in its trading
rules. One of the more persistent gripes is that in negotiations with
Chinese officials reference is often made to unpublished regulations, many
of which tend to be discriminatory.
Governments and businesses have criticised the lack of consistency in
trading regulations between Chinese provinces and regions. In response, Mr
Miao, the Moftec spokesman, says that China intends to spend three years on
building up 'a fairly complete system of foreign economic and trade law and
regulations.'
Trade authorities have also pledged to improve the system of tax rebates for
exports. Exporting enterprises, which are obliged to import raw materials or
semi-finished products, are often at loggerheads with the authorities over
customs and other rebates.
China has also opened further its export sector by encouraging the
activities of a growing number of trading corporations - 'whereas in 1978
(the year that China resolved to open to the world) foreign trade was
monopolised by 12 Foreign Trade Corporations, today over 3,600 FTC's compete
increasingly fiercely for export business,' says a recent World Bank study*.
This year China also opened to tender exports of items subject to quota.
Initially, 13 such items were offered, including foodstuffs and raw
materials. Trade officials say the process will be extended to cover all
items covered by quota.
Overshadowing the complex issue of internal trade reform, however, are
China's difficult negotiations on Gatt re-entry. While officials insist that
Beijing has reached the limit of 'concessions' it is prepared to make to
become Gatt-consistent, US negotiators are demanding further progress on a
range of issues.
In October, Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US Trade Representative, said
China would need to 'put its foot on the gas pedal' if it were to meet
requirements of Gatt-entry in time for it to become a founder-member of the
World Trade Organisation.
The US, which represents the Gatt-community in negotiations with Beijing,
has focused on key areas of trade reform in which it says China has made
insufficient progress to satisfy Gatt-requirements. These include access to
the services sector, financial and non-financial, and enforcement of
regulations prohibiting infringement of intellectual property rights. Ms
Barshefsky said that the US expected China to eliminate 'rampant' piracy in
the audio-visual and computer software sectors.
She also complained strongly about agricultural import bans saying
restrictions were of 'serious concern with respect to China's agricultural
schedule in the Gatt-WTO accession.'
The stage has thus been set for a tough final stage of negotiations. Li
Zhongzhou, director general of the Department of International Trade and
Economic Relations, said China would consider abandoning the Gatt and going
its own way, thus threatening a 'chaotic situation' in world trade.
Mr Li said China had reduced tariffs across the board by 55 per cent, and
had also committed itself to phase out most quota restrictions by 1997 in
its efforts to satisfy Gatt requirements. But progress in tariff reform is
perhaps less impressive than officials suggest. As the 1994 World Bank
study* on China's Trade Reform reported, 'China's tariffs remain higher,
more numerous and more dispersed than those of most other large developing
countries.'
China's interest in securing Gatt membership is attributable to its desire
to be a founder WTO-member and, perhaps more important, to its interest in
benefiting from the Uruguay round liberalisation, which is dependent on Gatt
accession.
The World Bank estimates that if protection levels in the EU the US and
Japan were reduced by 50 per cent, China's exports would increase by an
estimated 38 per cent, or Dollars 11.4bn, in terms of 1988 prices. China
would also benefit from Uruguay round tariff cuts that would erode the
preference margins other developing countries enjoy, and China does not,
under the Generalised System of Preferences.
It is little wonder that China prizes Gatt entry so highly. Of all the
world's big trading nations, it probably has most to gain.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (9): A vital role
for training - The skills shortage is causing employers anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt about what Mr David Ritchie, the civil servant appointed
to co-ordinate the government's work across the West Midlands, sees as the
main problem for the region's economy.
'The single most important difficulty we have in this region is in skills
and training. We have the worst-trained workforce in UK,' he says.
Employers complain that school leavers do not have the levels of literacy
and numeracy required in a world where skills in the workplace need to keep
pace with technological change.
In 1992, 7.3 per cent of West Midlands school leavers had no qualifications,
compared with a UK average of 6.6 per cent.
The UK has set national training targets. Lifetime target I is that 80 per
cent of the workforce be qualified to NVQ (national vocational
qualification) or equivalent level by 2000.
Lifetime target III is that half be qualified to NVQ level 3. The West
Midlands is the third worst UK region in its progress towards the former and
the worst in respect of the latter.
Surveys, such as the recent review by the Birmingham Economic Information
Centre, suggest that the skills problems are greatest in the manufacturing
sector, which is the mainstay of the West Midlands economy, and particularly
among the small and medium-sized companies.
Many small companies cont-inue to prosper without bothering with training. A
caricature of such a company would be one run by a self-made entrepreneur
with no formal training, whose employees are all trained to work their
machines, and who continues to make enough profit to draw a good living and
drive a big car.
Mr Edward Roberts, chair-man of Heath Springs, a spring-maker with 112
employees in Redditch, south of Birmingham, does not fit that caricature.
A former chairman of Centec, the training and enterprise council for the
area south of Birmingham, he is something of a missionary for the training
cause.
Most companies, he says, 'train because people say it's necessary, but they
are not quite sure what it is and they don't relate it to the require-ments
of their business.' He cites as a particular weakness reluctance among the
owner-managers of some companies to accept that they might benefit from
training.
The majority of companies are reasonably good at statutory training, such as
health and safety and first aid, he says, but because they don't think about
training for the long term strategic develop-ment of their companies, skill
shortages are inevitable.
There are skill shortages already, even at this stage of the recovery, says
Mr Roberts. He identifies a shortage of good people in the 35-45 age bracket
with experience of new equipment.
For his company, this means no night working - the employees do not have to
do it. His overseas competitors do not have the same restrictions. 'Twenty
years ago, our competition was all within 25 miles. Now it is not in the
UK.'
Like many small suppliers to the automotive industry, Heath Springs is
wrestling to retain the old skills - which Mr Roberts refers to as the
'black arts' needed to run older machines which appear to have personalities
of their own - while also developing skills to deal with fast-changing
demands from customers, to flatten the management structure and cope with
concepts such as statistical process control.
Skill requirements have changed dramatically in the past five years, he
says. Customers expect his company to be much more pro-active in design,
development and control of the parts it produces, while the flatter
organisation 'needs people who can communicate with other people and with
customers'.
Mr Roberts believes training in team leadership has paid off, as employees
are encouraged to produce ideas. And more is being demanded in basic skills
 -he needs employees with managerial potential to have language skills,
unthinkable 20 years ago in the UK, though not overseas.
But there is a downside, especially for the smaller company in a sector
where it is one of only a few that take training seriously.
Its training investment can be wasted if a competitor pays a small amount of
extra salary to snatch away an expensively-trained craftsman. Mr Roberts
says he lost one a week after he returned from an expensive trip to the US.
As a former training and enterprise council (Tec) chairman, he is positive
about the new national vocational qualification system, and the way it
enhances the self-esteem of people whose skills were once not accompanied by
certificates. He is also supportive of Investors in People (IIP), the
personnel development quality standard being backed by the government.
He believes the larger companies which already subscribe should promote it
among their suppliers, in the same way as they promoted the quality standard
BS5750.
Many commentators believe this is the way forward - if the big manufacturers
required suppliers to take training needs seriously through IIP, there would
be more of a level playing-field for companies like Heath Springs, and more
trained people available in the region.
Rover Group says it takes an interest in the 'whole business environment' of
suppliers, although it did not currently specify any training measure. It
might in future start specifying a measure, which might be IIP.
Mr Chris Tillett, a principal with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, says
most new investment is expected to be in small companies, which will not
have in-house training capacity.
If there is not a supply of skilled people, it will be more difficult to
compete with other areas for investment - Hertfordshire, for example, is
trumpeting the availability of skills from the aerospace industry.
Mr Tillett says the better educated parts of the region, such as Shropshire
and Warwickshire - are attracting higher value-added activities. For the
Birmingham conur-bation, however, skills remain a serious issue.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (10): Beyond the
corner shop - Ethnic diversity gives business a lift, but also raises
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent survey from the Birmingham Economic Information Centre (BEIC) cites
'clear statistical evidence' of discrimination against ethnic minority
groups in the labour market.
It says unemployment among minority groups is double that among whites.
Unemployment among those with higher qualifications was 8.8 per cent for
ethnic minorities, 3.2 per cent for whites.
The 1991 census figures on the gulf between rich and poor surprised many
people by their scale and by the deterioration since the 1981 census.
Researchers from the BEIC - set up by the city council and the training and
enterprise council - used the census to compile a study of deprivation,
comparing the city's electoral wards.
Unemployment in inner-city Sparkbrook was 32.6 per cent, while in leafy
Sutton Four Oaks it was 4.7 per cent. In Sparkbrook, 13.5 per cent of
households were overcrowded (more than one person per room), compared with
0.5 per cent in Four Oaks. In Sparkbrook, 35.2 per cent of
non-pensioner-only households had no earned income, against 4.2 per cent in
Four Oaks. Sparkbrook had a black and ethnic minority population of 66.6 per
cent, Four Oaks of 2.5 per cent.
Workers from overseas - particularly the Indian subcontinent and East Africa
 -were lured to the West Midlands in the boom times after the war, when
factories were short of labour. In Birmingham alone, there are now estimated
to be 66,000 people of Pakistani origin, 51,000 Indians and 13,000
Bangladeshis.
As workers in the older industries - often unskilled and semi-skilled - many
were among the victims of factory closures in the 1970s, though, says Mr
Ripan Sachdev, a chartered accountant in Coventry, some put their redundancy
money to work in a small business.
He says the latest recession has damaged the Asian community significantly,
with fewer opportunities for those made redundant.
Some of the small shops which had prospered are falling victim to the
squeeze in retailing generally, while they and other small businesses do not
have the technology and marketing techniques increasingly needed for
survival. But as some areas suffer, there is hope in the way that younger
Asians are taking over family businesses, with skills newly acquired in
colleges and in self-help community initiatives.
Many textiles businesses were notorious as sweatshops. But Mr Sachdev says
the sector is modernising, as companies bring in information technology and
employ designers, aiming to sell to the high street retailer rather than the
market stall. Some children of corner-shop owners are exploring other market
sectors.
Mr Davinder Panesar, of the Indian Community Centre in Coventry, is
attempting to build on the Asian tradition of working from home. He wants to
replace the women's sewing machines with personal computers, to encourage
the growth of teleworking. 'We have the skills base, we have the skills in
business, we have the ethic and philosophy of women working from home.'
With a large contribution - about Pounds 340,000 - from a local Asian
businessman, there are plans for a teleworking centre with a nursery
attached, so that childcare can be provided while the women train and work.
LIke Mr Sachdev, Mr Panesar sees great difficulties for people seeking work.
Some had committed themselves to helping their parents in corner shops,
which then went down in the recession. Competition for jobs is intense,
though Mr Panesar plays down the role of crude racial discrimination -
often, he says, a youngster from college is competing with a redundant
executive with a track-record and a network. He also believes the new
generation has lost some of the vigour and vision which drove their parents
to build their businesses.
Working with the University of Coventry, the centre saw a need for an
academic platform for Sikh culture - 54 per cent of the city's ethnic
minority population is Sikh - and the university has agreed to help accredit
a course in Sikh philosophy and theology.
In the field of practical skills, a national vocational qualification is
being developed in authentic Asian cuisine, gaining accreditation for the
ability that thousands of people, especially women, already have.
The Asian community has in the past, says Mr Panesar, been 'quite
disorganised'. Now, locally-educated British Asians know the country's
systems and standards and have the skills, especially with computers, to use
their knowledge. Mr Panesar says the community is organising itself and
building networks across regions, counties and cities - 'and soon across
countries'.
Such initiatives will make a difference, but more help from outside is
needed to address the intractable problem of the inner cities.
The economic review from the BEIC issues a stern warning. A growing
proportion of school leavers will be from ethnic minorities, it says.
'Discriminatory and other barriers will need to be addressed urgently by
employers and others if a satisfactory supply of labour is to be maintained.
In particular, recruitment of Asian women needs to be encouraged,' it says.
'Some employers will only consider recruiting from minority groups when the
economy grows quickly. Without intervention, these trends will have major
implications for the Birmingham economy.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (7): Earning an accolade - Manufacturing
company profile, Shanghai Fenghwa Ball Pen Company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In China - notes Cai Ruixing, chairman of the Shanghai Fenghwa Ball Pen
Company - the ownership of ball-point pens averages only 0.5 per person. In
the US the figure is nine. If Chinese consumption were to reach US levels,
more than 10bn additional pens would be sold. Against this, Fenghwa expects
to make a mere 155m ball-point pens in 1994, writes Martin Wolf.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are stupefying. But they are not
implausible, since pens are a relatively cheap luxury item. The potential
for growth must greatly exceed what Fenghwa has achieved since its founding
in 1948, even though it already supplies 46 per cent of the domestic market
for ball-point pens.
As China's economy becomes more open, the company's growth will also depend
on its international competitiveness. But Fenghwa does not have that much
reason to worry. It already exports about a quarter of its output and
derives 20 per cent of revenue from its sales to markets in eastern Europe,
the middle east, the US, Latin America, South Africa and elsewhere in
south-east Asia, including Japan. Furthermore, the retail price of one of
its medium-quality ball-point pens is only some Yn4.5 (Dollars 0.55).
What has made such success possible is, argues Mr Cai, the programme of
management reform, investment, innovation, quality improvement and attention
to markets undertaken since 1991, when he took over his present job.
As important, Fenghwa's output lies squarely within the confines of China's
comparative advantage. The manufacture of ball-point pens, propelling
pencils, fountain pens and crayons demands precision and attention to
quality. But the processes are labour-intensive and not that technically
sophisticated. As a medium-sized company, employing 1,600 people and
enjoying a strong domestic reputation, Fenghwa ought to thrive in China's
new economic environment.
So how has the company gone about becoming more competitive?
Mr Cai points, first, to the transformation of management, noting the
company's success in passing ISO 9001 (an internationally recognised
standard of quality management) last year. An important aspect has been
reform of employment practices. The enterprise remains responsible for
providing housing, pensions and other benefits, as is normal in China. But
the workers are now employed on contracts of up to five years. In
compensation, they are paid relatively well by Chinese standards, the
average annual wage now being Yn11,300, a rise of 140 per cent since 1992.
Second, Mr Cai stresses Fenghwa's investments, including its purchase of
advanced foreign machinery and its move in 1992 to a new plant in a
development zone across the river from old Shanghai - 'ever since then,' he
notes, 'we have enjoyed a fundamental transformation.'
Finally, he notes the company's close attention to market developments and
quality. One aspect is product innovation, with 50 per cent of the 180
models developed in the past three years. Another is the company's recent
assumption from the state of all responsibility for marketing - both at home
and abroad.
Central to the strategy was the transformation of Fenghwa from a traditional
state-owned enterprise into a share-holding company. In September 1992, the
company was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange and issued 56m shares.
Altogether the company has raised more than Yn120m in this way. This sum
helped finance its investments, although the company also relied on bank
loans and re-invested profits.
Now there are 84m shares outstanding, 60 per cent of which are owned by the
state, 25 per cent by other enterprises and the balance by individuals.
The shares have at least been a reasonably good investment. Initially listed
at Yn5.5 per share, their price peaked at Yn16 and was still - said the
chairman, consulting one of Shanghai's ubiquitous bleepers - Yn9.2 on
October 11, 1994.
Where does Fenghwa go now? Its chairman has bold plans to turn it into a
group. There will, he hopes, be three or four joint ventures with reputable
foreign manufacturers.
There are also plans for two office developments, one on the site of an old
workshop in central Shanghai. But its staple businesses will not be
forgotten. Fenghwa has been called a 'dragon head' plant in the production
of ball-point pens. It expects to earn that accolade.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (6): Baffling questions for China-watchers -
The country's economic structure and performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If, as has been said, there are lies, damned lies and statistics, Chinese
data must fall within a particularly obscure sub-category of the latter.
People want to know how poor (or rich) China now is and how fast its economy
has been growing. Few questions about China are more important - and none
are more difficult to answer.
After 1949, China borrowed both its economic system and its statistical
approach from the Soviet Union. Instead of gross national product,
statistics were prepared in accordance with the material product system
(MPS), which excludes all services not directly related to production (such
as education, health, passenger transport and government).
This system also relies on comprehensive reporting from a
directly-controlled network of productive units, instead of the more
flexible sample surveys used in decentralised market economies. In a command
economy, statistics on output are also management accounts, which means that
reporting units have an incentive to exaggerate their output.
Faulty in conception, China's statistical system was damaged by the Great
Leap Forward. Then, during the Cultural Revolution, the national statistical
system was closed down for approximately a decade. Even the collection of
data on material product did not recover fully until the middle-to-late
1980s.
Mr Qiu Xiaohua, senior statistician at the State Statistical Bureau (SSB),
admits, in addition, that output of township and village enterprises, which
are increasingly important to the Chinese economy, continues to be scantily
reported. Also inadequate is information on personal income and expenditure,
essential for the calculation of gross national product and purchasing power
parity (PPP) estimates of national income. Furthermore, the shift to the
preparation of data in accordance with the United Nations System of National
Accounts (SNA), which started only in 1985, will not be fully completed
until the second half of the 1990s.
Given such defects, serious difficulties arise if Chinese data are to be
compared either with those of other countries, or over time.
The simplest comparisons should be for GDP at market exchange rates. The
World Bank now suggests that GNP per head in 1992 was US Dollars 470.
India's GNP per head was US Dollars 310, it says, but even countries like
Sri Lanka (US Dollars 540) and Zimbabwe (US Dollars 570) rank above China.
The World Bank's estimate is a big jump from previous ones, which derived
directly from the SSB's measure of GDP per head (in yuan). It is widely
believed that the World Bank kept Chinese GNP per head down deliberately to
ensure its eligibility for concessional lending. If so, it followed the
Chinese lead.
Now, however, the Bank has delivered an upward adjustment of 34 per cent.
Fourteen percentage point of this is for reporting failures. Particularly
large corrections have been made for housing consumption, grain output,
rural industrial output and rural service-sector consumption, all of which
are thought to be significantly under-recorded. Meanwhile, eighteen
percentage points of the adjustment are for price distortions, the argument
being that the output of some sectors - notably housing and coal - are
significantly underpriced relative to market economies at comparable
standards of living. (Note that the corrections are multiplicative, not
additive.)
Even after these upward adjustments, China's GNP in 1992 was only US Dollars
546bn, which was smaller than Spain's.
An alternative approach, which seems more realistic in certain respects, is
to estimate the purchasing power of GDP at international prices. Since
services are very cheap in poorer countries (because wages are so low), the
result is to increase estimated GDP relative to richer countries by
substantial amounts.
Widely-reported calculations that China already has the third largest
economy in the world are derived from what amount to guesses of its GDP per
head at PPP. Rather more solidly based calculations on the same lines make
India the world's sixth largest economy, which is less widely publicised. As
the table indicates, China's GDP at PPP has been estimated at between US
Dollars 1,000 and US Dollars 3,000 per head.
Nobody knows more precisely as yet, because the necessary surveys have not
been carried out, although steps are now being taken to do so. But surveys
will be particularly difficult in China, because of the country's size and
the discrepancy in quality between Chinese goods and services, on the one
hand, and those in more advanced countries, on the other.
Some analysts have tried to solve the problem of estimating China's real GDP
by relying on physical indicators - such as output of grain, coal or steel -
or social indicators - such as longevity, number of physicians or school
attendance. These are then related to the past performance of other
countries, in order to obtain estimates of income per head for China today.
Such comparisons are fraught with danger, because the structure of China's
economy is quite dissimilar to that of market economies. Its historic
emphasis on commodity output and investment, means, for example, that
comparisons with past levels of output in the Korean Republic or Taiwan
almost certainly exaggerate Chinese GDP today.
Still more risky is casual empiricism. Visitors to Shanghai can see it is
quite prosperous, but - as the chart shows - its income per head (at market
exchange rates) is utterly unrepresentative of China as a whole. What is
also important to remember is that it contains just over 1 per cent of
China's population.
The safe conclusion is that China is still a very poor country, with a
modest GDP at market prices. It has a far larger GDP at PPP, mainly because
of the consequent revaluation of its low quality non-tradeable services. The
latter adjustment indicates nothing new about China's global significance,
however, as is too often supposed, beyond what is already implicit in the
huge population.
Can any more confidence be placed in the reported rates of economic growth?
Between 1978 and 1993, according to SSB statistics, the Chinese economy
expanded at a compound annual rate of 9 per cent a year, for an overall
increase of 260 per cent. The largest country that has ever reported
comparable rates of economic growth over a long period is Japan, which has
only a tenth China's population.
There are good reasons, however, to question both the rate and the quality
of reported rates of growth. If the measured GDP per head in 1992 and its
reported growth between 1980 and 1992 are worked backwards, GDP per head
becomes US Dollars 195 in 1980 (in 1992 dollars). If so, China's income per
head was then below India's - indeed among the lowest in the world.
The problem becomes worse if China's growth is worked still further back. If
official rates of growth are run back to 1965, it turns out that China's GDP
per head was less than half of India's in that year. This is inconsistent
with statistics on the quality of life in China, compared to India's, at
that time. It is more plausible to assume the current relationship is
roughly correct, but growth rates in China have been lower.
In common with most state-socialist countries there is also a tendency to
under-estimate inflation and exaggerate real output increases. One reason is
that this is a way for managers of state enterprises to claim undeserved
success. Furthermore, GDP data for the late 1970s and early 1980s are, in
any case, known to be both incomplete and inaccurate.
According to successive World Development Reports China's GDP head rose only
from US Dollars 260 in 1979 to US Dollars 370 in 1991, a nominal increase of
only 42 per cent (see chart), even though the SSB reported a rise of 166 per
cent in real GDP over the period. The reason for this discrepancy between
the growth of Chinese GDP at domestic and international prices was the steep
devaluation of the official exchange rate from Yn1.55 to the dollar in 1979
to Yn5.32 in 1991. This slide (which implies a large depreciation in real
terms) is a reminder of the price distortions that existed in the Chinese
planned economy.
These price distortions remain pervasive. Foodstuffs, urban housing, many
services and coal have been underpriced, while many manufactures have been
overpriced, particularly in view of their poor quality. In the presence of
distortions, measured growth may mean little improvement in economic
welfare. It may largely reflect transfers of income from under-priced to
over-priced sectors.
It is worth remembering that reported rates of economic growth under
socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were generally
faster than those of western Europe, while investment was also higher. Yet
the opening up of these economies has shown that they were in fact falling
further and further behind.
China's economy still remains state-socialist in important respects. While
the share of the state enterprises in output has apparently fallen to below
half of total industrial output, more than 60 per cent of total fixed
investment, amounting to over 20 per cent of GDP, still goes to the state
sector.
Chinese statistics report that nearly half of the increase in total output
between 1978 and 1993 was investment and that investment grew by 360 per
cent in real terms between 1978 and 1993 (a compound rate of growth of 11
per cent), while consumption grew by only 212 per cent (a compound rate of 8
per cent). Given the uncertainty about the economic rate of return on
investment, it may be wise to view the growth rate of consumption as a more
accurate indicator of the economy's performance than that of GDP.
Finally, when considering the quality of growth it is worth remembering the
rapidly-growing environmental problems: falling water-tables; dead lakes and
rivers; and polluted air. Properly accounted for, such costs would subtract
substantially from past Chinese performance. Large sums will have to be
expended on cleaning it all up in future.
In sum, both the reported rate of economic growth and its effects on
economic welfare must be questioned. Bits of the Chinese economy are
internationally competitive: export performance demonstrates that. Equally
obvious are improvements in the living standards of the population. Even so,
the view that the entire Chinese economy has been growing as fast as South
Korea's may be a significant exaggeration.
If one is to know accurately how well China is performing and how rich it
is, the shift to an internationally open and domestically competitive market
economy needs to be completed. There is still quite a long way to go - and
then the statistics must catch up.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (8): Joblessness is rising rapidly in urban
areas - Labour market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the thorniest nettles waiting to be grasped by China's Communist
rulers is the management of the country's labour market.
Reforming the labour market is a prime requirement for China's transition
from a planned to market economy. Yet reform in this area is potentially a
threat to the Communist party's control of Chinese society.
At the heart of the party's control in urban China is the danwei system  - a
cradle-to-grave set of welfare and social constraints which binds every
urban worker and his family to a danwei, or 'work unit.' Implicit in this
system has been the concept of a job for life as well as constant vigilance
over workers' political attitudes. This is underpinned by a system of
'household registration' which requires each urban resident to carry a
permit to live in the city.
Chinese state enterprises are some of the country's largest work units. With
officials admitting that a only a third of these state companies are
profitable, the day of reckoning is dawning. The once-iron bonds which tied
the worker to his workplace and city are beginning to break.
China's urban work force of 180m is undergoing unprecedented upheaval, the
clash between a state sector and a vibrant private sector. Added to the
stresses and strains of this big structural adjustment is the relentless
pressure of population growth which is forcing the government to sanction,
de facto, much greater job mobility.
China's urban work force grows by 10m a year as school and college leavers
enter the market for work.
'We have a huge task to satisfy the employment demands of all able bodied
workers in China,' says Mr Zhang Liuji, deputy minister of labour. 'Supply
exceeds demand and we think this situation will last for a long time.'
Joblessness is rising rapidly in urban China, giving rise to fears among
Chinese leaders that unemployment if not checked may lead to social unrest
and, possibly, political instability. China's official unemployment figures
only hint at the problem. The urban unemployment rate last year was 2.6 per
cent; this year officials expect it to rise to 3 per cent, or some 5.4m
people.
'Considering there are 5m to 6m workers who have not been paid in months,
the real unemployment rate would well double government figures,' observed
one official newspaper recently. Worryingly, about 80 per cent of the
unemployed are young people.
The government expects unemployment to rise in the coming years, the sources
of which are twofold. The first is the state sector where currently 15m, or
nearly 20 per cent of the total state industrial work force, are estimated
officially to be redundant workers still drawing pay and entitlements. The
second is the countryside where officials estimate there are 130m surplus
workers, 30m of which are expected to flock to the cities in search of work
after the Chinese new year holiday next year.
'A whole bowl of rice has to be eaten one spoon at a time,' says Mr Zhang,
rejecting any shock treatment for the state industries. He says it is the
government's hope that by the end of the century state industry can be
reformed sufficiently so that manning levels can be reduced to economic
levels. A plan, however, to begin an 'experiment' with China's top 100
enterprises, including widespread job shedding, has been deferred for a
year.
To deal with rising jobless- ness the government plans to expand its
provision of unemployment services:
Employment exchanges. By the end of 1993 there were 15,000 employment
exchanges in China. These job centres placed 8m of the 11.4m job seekers in
work. By 1995 the government hopes to extend the network of job centres to
China's rural areas.
Employment training. There are 2,500 training centres in China which provide
pre-employment for unemployed youth and women, as well as skills training
for those who have to change jobs. The job training centres have a capacity
for 3m; by 1995 the government wants to raise that to 4m people a year.
Subsidies. It also hopes the unemployed will seize the opportunities
provided by subsidies to 'employment service enterprises.'
These enterprises receive tax holidays, and cheap loans to buy equipment. At
the end of last year there were some 200,000 such enterprises employing 9m;
by 1995 the labour ministry wants to see 240,000 enterprises employing 10m.
Say Mr Zhang: 'It is more important to be employed than receive benefits.'
Alongside the worsening outlook for employment, however, has been a
noticeable deterioration in conditions for the employed. This is to be
expected, given Chian's stage of economic development. However, industrial
safety has become a big issue, especially after some high profile industrial
accidents in factories owned by investors from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.
There have been widespread demonstrations in China's north-east over the
past year, protesting at working conditions, low pay and unemployment.
Nation-wide there has been a sharp rise in labour disputes this year.
Figures for the first quarter showed that there had been more than 3,000
disputes referred to in 20 provinces and municipalities - some 66 per cent
more than for the previous period of 1993. Officials believe there is little
reason to expect that full year figures will show much of an improvement in
labour relations. Labour ministry officials hope that a new labour law,
which came into force in July, will help to ameliorate some of the problems
in China's factories. When introducing the law earlier this year Mr Li
Boyong, the labour minister, said the law would protect the legal rights of
labourers and 'establish and maintain harmonious relations between employers
and employees'.
It is unlikely that the law will be successful in this aim. Its thrust is,
after all, to promote labour market efficiency. The law makes it easier for
companies to hire and fire workers; offer pay based on skills and
performance rather than just seniority as was the case in the past; and
negotiate the terms on which a worker is hired.
Labour contracts were introduced experimentally in 1983 and were formalised
in 1986. They apply to new workers and greatly increase the flexibility
provided to enterprises to reject unsuitable candidates. Yet, in spite of
this, the penetration of the contract system in the state enterprise sector
was low - just 27.6 per cent of enterprises had adopted labour contracts by
the end of June this year.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (7): Unease at
the nation's crossroads - The extensive transport system is still
inadequate, say businesssmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Midlands region has an extensive road system, the UK's main
north-south rail link, and an international airport within easy reach of
Birmingham city centre.
However, businessmen argue that the principal roads are congested, and they
point to the increasing need for supplier companies to meet the faster and
more accurate delivery times required by big manufacturers. They complain
about a lack of investment in the main west coast railway line, just as it
is becoming a vital access route to the Channel tunnel.
The airport is gearing up for expansion and is hoping to attract travellers
who currently prefer to use Heathrow or Manchester.
Mr Tony Bradley, home policy manager of Birmingham chamber of commerce,
argues that transport is the key to everyone else's industry. The transport
network that grew up to serve West Midlands manufacturing became one of its
strengths as its dependency on exports increased.
Birmingham found itself at a transport crossroads, and pressure on links
intensified as more motorists used roads built to serve industry, and as
those roads became through-routes on the south-east to north-west axis
linking the country's three main conurbations.
The stretch of the M6 across the north-west of Birmingham is a prime
example. Built to a capacity of 80,000-90,000 vehicles a day, it is now
carrying 115,000. A second public inquiry is under way into a proposed new
motorway - the Birmingham northern relief road - to take through-traffic
away from the conurbation.
After the first public inquiry the road was approved, but then the
government decided it wanted it to be the UK's first private-sector tolled
motorway. This time there are more objectors, as some believe a toll
motorway would put the area at a disadvantage.
Further north, there are plans to widen the M6 between Stafford and
Manchester.
Much local lobbying has tried to persuade the government to allow the
upgrading of the 500-mile west coast main line, the railway linking London,
the Midlands, north-west England and west-central Scotland. Inter City, the
train operator, is doing its best, running a service on 30-year-old
equipment. Railtrack and WCML Development, a private sector consortium, are
carrying out a feasibility study for the upgrading.
Planning permission has been given for two regional freight terminals - at
Daventry and Hams Hall - to serve Channel tunnel services.
The West Midlands is one of the few conurbations of any size without an
underground or light rail rapid transit system. This is a deficiency the
region is anxious to put right. It regards the plan for a three-stage
development, starting with a line from Birmingham to Wolverhampton, as a
main contender for government help.
There are also hopes that this metro would have a link with the airport,
whose finance director, Mr Stephen Greenwood, argues that expansion could be
an important jobs generator. The airport will handle about 5m passengers
this year - a further 1m, he said, could add 1,000 jobs to the local
economy.
Birmingham airport's expansion plans are based on getting a bigger share of
the market in its own back yard. The airport meets about half the region's
leisure demand (compared with Manchester's 95 per cent) and 41 per cent of
scheduled demand (65 per cent). Thirty-eight per cent of West Midlands
passengers for Paris use Heathrow in spite of Birmingham's offering nine
flights a day.
To rectify the situation, the airport this month opens a marketing campaign
based on the slogan: 'The world on your doorstep.' It will emphasise the
services, as well as the airport's relatively easy access and parking and
its claimed advantage over Heathrow in speed of baggage and passenger
handling.
The airport's expansion plans involve more than doubling the main terminal
area, and expanding the Eurohub terminal used by British Airways to create
capacity to handle at least 11m passengers a year by 2005. Planning
permission will be applied for early next year.
In the longer term, the airport wants to extend its runway from the present
2,600 metres to 3,100m, to enable it to serve the most distant long-haul
destinations. Mr Greenwood emphasises that the airport can expand regardless
of that extra capability. It is currently in public consultation, especially
with affected communities, and will not seek planning permission for two to
three years.
Crucial to any large expansion is the airport's plan to end its
public-sector status, so that it can fund its Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m
development without an impact on the public sector borrowing requirement. It
is owned by seven local authorities - Birmingham, with 38 per cent, and
Solihull, Coventry, Dudley, Walsall, Sandwell and Wolverhampton in 8-12 per
cent parcels.
The councils have agreed to become a minority shareholder, and control
collectively no more than 49 per cent. The rest will be disposed of by
attracting strategic partners to invest in the airport, placing shares with
institutions or a combination of the two. The government has approved the
move in principle, and the airport is aiming for partial privatisation by
next spring.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (8): Wheels
within wheels - The region's lack of cohesion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Midlands is a disparate area which exists as a region for the
purposes of government administration rather than for any historical
reasons.
It has no distinct lobbying strength in Whitehall in the way that Scotland
and Wales have, for instance, with their Cabinet representation; or even as
the north-east of England has managed to put together in the past decade.
The new government regional offices in England do not have a direct line to
the Treasury, but must go through each of the relevant Whitehall departments
when bidding in the public expenditure round.
The West Midlands' cities - Birmingham and Coventry - and the urban and
industrial mass of the Black Country have not been as successful as, say,
Glasgow, Manchester and Sheffield in forcing the hand of government towards
aiding their regeneration - no doubt because, until the mid-1970s, this was
a much more successful area.
In pushing for better transport and communications, the West Midlands has
had little success. The road to relieve the congested M6 north of Birmingham
is unlikely to come into being until the end of the decade.
Birmingham and the Black Country are still without a good passenger transit
system, and the area has yet to see the investment in the Inter-City rail
line which would speed up services to London.
Traffic at Birmingham airport is expanding, but the range of international
destinations is considerably smaller than those from Manchester.
In earlier years when efforts were being made to reduce dependence on
manufacturing the appearance of Birmingham, strangled by roads, and shorn of
the sort of buildings that were being smartened up elsewhere, could be seen
as a liability.
The city fathers, Labour and Conservative, have been successful in prising
money out of Brussels to smarten up the city centre. Birmingham city
council, with the biggest budget of any local authority, still sees itself
as the powerhouse in the region, in spite of the erosion of local government
responsibilities in favour of government-appointed quangos. But there is
co-operation between the council and the quangos - and between Birmingham
and the Black Country authorities on the one hand, and Birmingham and
Coventry councils on the other.
The pre-eminence of Birmingham as the centre for business services is
undisputed. Other local councillors in the region may have resented the
city's dominance in the past, but there is now a growing awareness of the
need for the region to upgrade and compete more effectively in every sense,
and for the different parts to complement each other.
Except that it is not a region in any cohesive sense. Economic geographers
saw the West Midlands as straddling the traditional north-south divide of
Britain, with the south of the region relating more to the prosperous south
of the country and the north having more in common with the industrial
landscape of the north.
The sharpness of the divide may have been alleviated by the impact of
recession on the south-east and the regeneration of the north, but it still
exists in the sense that the pressures to expand and develop are greater to
the south than to the north. They have been intensified with the completion
of the M40 and M42 motorway network which has made more attractive the areas
to the south of Birmingham and Coventry. Meanwhile, the brake on development
in the north of the region was consequent on the long delay in commissioning
a relief road to the M6.
The government's draft regional planning guidance on land use, issued in
September 1994, is clear about the need for local authorities to steer
development to the north and west of the region, and resist pressure from
developers to take bites out of the green belt to the south. The so-called
Middle Ring of towns - from WarwickLeamington through
KidderminsterStourport, Telford, and round to Lichfield - have been on the
receiving end of the flight from the metropolis. The aim is to develop not
here, but in the inner areas of the depleted cities.
Developers will be inclined to exert pressure on authorities to develop
where they see the best return. Considerable subsidies will be needed to
tempt them into the inner city, emphasising the need for urban authorities
to produce schemes which will win a chunk of the government's Single
Regeneration Budget for the region. Birmingham has recently won development
area status, although the lobby was more from local government than local
business, which was reluctant to be tagged with a label that indicates that
the area is in dire need.
Birmingham and area business chiefs have been working to boost the city
within Europe in the past few years. But they have yet to constitute a
powerful base akin to the business-based teams in some American cities, or
even other parts of Britain, which have helped to improve the environment
and attract newcomers. Business in in the region seems only recently to have
become aware of the environment.
In the 1960s, developers and architects, and a few leading companies,
together with the city council, formed a convenient, informal coalition. The
scene is now more complex. Many family-owned companies were swallowed up, or
simply went out of business. Birmingham still has more head offices than any
city outside London, but executive decisions on behalf of the big companies
are made outside the city, and outside the country in some cases.
Lobbying-power and influence lies more with a few individual business chiefs
than with institutions.
Parts of the shire counties have very different concerns from the built-up
areas of the region. Isolation, rather than congestion, can be the problem
here. The image conjured up by the West Midlands is the built-up mass which
extends from Coventry to Wolverhampton - the only break being the bit of
green belt between Birmingham and Coventry. But the region also includes
rural areas of Herefordshire and Shropshire. The continuing exodus of young
people, in search of work, is the concern here; whereas in the inner areas
of Birmingham and Coventry a different sort of depopulation, of the
economically active, has been going on for more than 20 years.
At the official level, the reconciliation of the needs and demands of this
diverse region lies not with any single elected body, but with a forum of
local authorities which has no public profile, complemented by the equally
low-profile government office which will be attempting to co-ordinate
departments and convey to Whitehall its priorities for the region.

Birmingham University has floated the idea of a Birmingham Investment Fund.
It would seek to attract long-term capital so that it could support the
science and technology from which will come the next generation of
industrial products.
Coventry University is planning an innovation centre which would enable
graduates from its product-oriented courses to start up and run new
companies which would capitalise on the ideas they have themselves
developed.
These two examples illustrate universities' increasing search for ways in
which they can help to foster regional economic growth.
The intellectual activities of universities can be a source of industrial
innovation. The problem is how to strengthen the link between academia and
industry. And, given the high importance of manufacturing in the regional
economy, the way this problem is handled is critical for the West Midlands.
'If you don't innovate, you're dead,' said Mr David Storey, head of the
centre for small and medium-sized enterprises at Warwick Business School.
In the six months to last April, according to the West Midlands Business
Survey, 13 per cent of companies introduced new products to the market,
compared with 4 per cent in 1991-92.
'If we don't make value-added products, we won't reverse decline,' warned Mr
Bob Bushaway, director of research support and industrial liaison at
Birmingham University.
There have always been ties between commerce and the institutions: in many
cases, the one provided the funds for the formation of the other. But now
the mutual dependence is increasingly recognised, as companies understand
the store of expertise locked in the universities and the universities are
required increasingly to act like businesses.
For the universities, there are hard financial reasons for re-examining ties
with industry. 'The Higher Education Funding Council notice that we're going
to have a 14 per cent fall in funding concentrated minds,' said Mr Charles
Leonard, head of commercial development at Coventry University. 'The only
way to improve the situation is to deal more effectively with the funds
you've got, or to generate more. All the universities in the region are
looking at generating more.'
On the face of it, the restructuring of industry gives the universities a
commercial opening which did not exist before. 'Industry has now shed a
great deal of the R&amp;D (research and development) it had in-house. So there
is an opportunity for universities,' suggested Mr Bushaway.
But Mr Leonard is doubtful whether much more research work will be farmed
out. 'Some companies have abandoned research altogether, rather than
commissioning research by others.'
The universities - Aston, Birmingham, Central England, Coventry, Keele,
Staffordshire, Warwick and Wolverhampton - are rivals to the extent that
they vie for undergraduates and post-graduates. Many have links with
companies for particular courses: Birmingham Business School and Powergen
for the MBA, for example.
But all do contract research, and in the industrial world they frequently
have niche areas of expertise: Birmingham (advanced materials), Warwick
(manufacturing systems), Staffordshire (ceramics). This reduces the chances
of the universities tripping over each other in the attempt to create
lucrative links with business.
'There's so much business for universities (that) we shouldn't be in
competition. If we did it all, we couldn't cope,' said Ms Anne Doughty,
director of Staffordshire University Enterprises.
'There's a lot of networking with other universities at working level, but
not at institutional level,' noted Mr Colin Rickwood, director of
Birmingham's business school.
Indeed, officials from each university, responsible for liaison with
industry, meet regularly at the government's regional offices to exchange
notes. So universities are being drawn more deeply into the web of agencies
interested in, or responsible for, economic development.
For example, Birmingham's prospectus for City Pride, an invitation from the
government to set out a vision of future development, recognised that 'there
must be better exploitation of Birmingham's research and development
capability.' It stated confidently that 'partnerships will be developed to
provide the key brokerage-entrepreneurial role linking research activity to
business and markets.'
The suggestion of a Birmingham Investment Fund is one way of creating such a
partnership; but how, in more general terms, this role might materialise is
unclear. In any case, it is a role which is of most relevance to smaller
companies. The larger ones will go their own way, creating their own
university relationships, as Rolls-Royce and Lucas have with Birmingham, or
Rover with Warwick.
Universities themselves have tended to see business or science parks as a
link with the wider commercial world. Such parks, attached to universities,
are scattered across the region and growing in number: Wolverhampton is the
latest to develop one. They could be the incubators for future
high-technology companies.
Looking at the Warwick park, arguably the best known in the Midlands and
home to 60 companies, Mr David Storey, of the university's business school,
identified three types of tenant: academics seeking a commercial spin-off
from their activities; businesses which seek links with the university, in
either an academic or social sense; and businesses that see the parks as a
desirable location but are not seeking to exploit a formal link with the
university. It is to this last category that universities will look first in
their search to tighten the academic-industrial nexus.
There could be obvious benefits in economic terms. Research at Warwick
University, said Mr Storey, had shown that 'science-based independent
businesses have faster growth rates and lower failure rates than typical
small businesses.'
In terms of job creation then, there is a strong regional incentive to draw
the universities into the wider commercial community - which explains the
government's interest in Coventry's plan to encourage suitably able
graduates to waste no time in plunging into commercial waters.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (4): Zooming in on the threat of inflation -
China's economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation is the Achilles heel of Chinese economic reform. High inflation
helped cause the conditions for the Tiananmen Square demonstration in 1989,
partly because of disgust over the associated corruption. Defeating the
political opposition then did grave damage to the credibility of the Chinese
government, while lowering inflation led to two years of real economic
growth at 4 per cent, virtual stagnation by recent Chinese standards.
Failure to rein in inflation this year might prove as damaging. Yet
over-zealous efforts to slow the economy could also prove destabilising.
The observer should examine the dilemma confronting the authorities as
though through a zoom lens, starting with the close-up.
According to China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB), the cost of living
nationwide was 27.4 per cent higher in September than in the same month last
year. In response to such pressures, argues vice-premier Li Lanqing, the
authorities have to rely on a wide range of economic, legal and
administrative means. Accordingly, price controls were imposed on staple
foodstuffs in September, even though reformers realise that such measures
are at best short term and can seriously endanger longer-term reforms.
Concern about the sharp rise in food prices over the past year is
understandable: food makes up more than half of the total weight in the
consumer price index; food prices also rose 35.3 per cent in the year to
August, while grain prices rose 54.6 per cent.
Food prices may have soared, but those of machinery and electronic products
fell slightly over the same period. Producer price inflation has disappeared
in response to the tightening of credit that initially followed the 16-point
programme of July 1993, masterminded by Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in
charge of the economy.
This picture seems inconsistent with the hypothesis of general excess
demand. Mr Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the SSB, blames recent inflation on
supply shocks, pointing to drought in northern China and flooding in the
south. Also important has been long-needed administrative price rises for
grain and other commodities this year. Mr Lou Jiwei, director of the
macroeconomic department of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economic System, points also to higher prices of oil.
Such analyses offer support to the economists who question government
policy. Mr Dong Fureng, vice-chairman of the financial and economic
committee of the People's National Congress, argues that 'if cost is pushing
up prices, demand is not the best way to control inflation.'
Mr Li Yining, vice-chairman of the law committee of the PNC, insists that
credit control even aggravates underlying difficulties. With supply the main
problem, he argues that China needs more investment, not less. Mr Li has a
point. But what is required is more investment in efficient distribution and
marketing systems, which is not what current distorted incentives would
secure.
Zooming out to a wider angle, the observer can see that the government's
efforts to control credit expansion are indeed justified, for two main
reasons.
First, so-called cost-push inflation is usually a lagged response to
previous excess demand. In China, for example, administered increases in
food prices are a consequence of past failure to adjust prices in line with
inflation. Second and most important, uncontrolled growth of credit and
money has become a serious threat to China's stability.
Recently published monetary statistics show that the broader M2 monetary
aggregate grew by 37.1 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 1994,
compared with 29.7 per cent in the year to the second quarter. Yet the
target for 1994 had been set at only 24 per cent.
Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBC),
attributed the excessive monetary growth to higher than planned capital
spending by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), lack of budgetary restraint,
large rises in wages and salaries for government employees and the increases
in payments to farmers. By revealing the figures so promptly, the PBC is
trying to strengthen its hand in the fight against inflation. Yet even the
PBC may be too complacent about the prospects.
In 1992 the ratio of M2 to gross domestic product in China was 105.7 per
cent, far higher than in other developing countries (see chart). Between
1984 and 1992, broad money's velocity of circulation fell from 1.56 to 0.95
 -a decline of around 6 per cent a year, (see chart). As inflation rose in
1993, however, velocity increased by 5 per cent, the harbinger of likely
embarrassment to come.
Mr Lou argues that the money supply can expand at 20 per cent a year without
danger. If real economic growth were to be 10 per cent a year and velocity
were to stabilise, this would indeed be consistent with inflation of 10 per
cent.
Unfortunately, recent growth of the money supply has been much faster than
20 per cent. In addition, the velocity of circulation could start to rise on
a sustained basis. One reason might be the effects of inflation,
particularly since real interest rates are currently negative (see chart).
Another would be an understandable desire on the part of the Chinese to
diversify away from money.
Any flight from money could destroy economic stability. China's past
monetary expansion has created a delayed-action bomb. Unfortunately, it will
be difficult to halt further increases in its explosive power, let alone
defuse it.
One reason for the difficulty is the monetary effects of the accumulation of
foreign-exchange reserves. These reached US Dollars 39.8bn by the end of
September, an 87 per cent increase on 1993 (see chart). The expansion
reflects attempts to keep down the exchange rate (unified at the beginning
of this year) in the presence of a trade surplus of US Dollars 1.4bn in the
first nine months of 1993, plus a large capital inflow (Dollars 14.7bn in
the first eight months).
Financial liberalisation has also created new sources of monetary growth.
The assets of non-bank financial institutions - Urban Credit Co-operatives
(UCCs) and Trust and Investment Companies (TICs) - have grown explosively,
from 6.5 per cent of those of the state banks in 1987 to 12.5 per cent in
1992. These institutions offer state banks and local governments a way to
evade central control over lending. Consequently, 'augmented' broad money,
which includes deposits at UCCs and TICs, has grown faster even than M2.
The most important causes of persistently rapid monetary growth are,
however, those alluded to by Mr Dai. The consolidated budget deficit, which
includes the directed policy lending of the PBC, has been running at an
average of around 5-6 per cent of GDP over the past seven years, reaching
7-9 per cent in 1993 (see report: Reform of the central bank, page seven).
If it were financed through bonds or asset sales, such a deficit need not be
that dangerous in the medium term for an economy as dynamic as China's. But
virtually all of it has been financed by the printing press. Seignorage -
revenue derived from the government's access to the central bank, via
expansion of money as a share of GDP - is estimated to have varied from 6 to
9 per cent of Chinese GDP between 1988 and 1992, an exceptionally high
figure by international standards.
A little over two-thirds of the seignorage came from real money expansion
and the rest from the inflation tax. As inflation rises, however, these
proportions will alter. But the monetary basis for seignorage would also
start to collapse.
The significance of such a shift for public finance can hardly be
exaggerated. In 1992, for example, seignorage from reserve money creation,
at some 6 per cent of GDP, amounted to just under 40 per cent of total
budgetary revenues. Similarly, direct and indirect government borrowing from
the PBC was just under 30 per cent of those revenues. The Chinese government
is, it appears, addicted to the printing press.
Now zoom to the widest angle: behind the monetary threat lies the political
frailty of central government vis a vis the interconnected interests of
local government and larger SOEs. Beijing has transferred control over SOEs
that generate 80 per cent of total SOE output to local governments, so
loosening central control over their investment. The fiscal autonomy of
local government, plus its leverage over local branches of the PBC, has
exacerbated this loss of influence. The resulting 'investment hunger' is
revealed in the fact that nominal capital spending was more than 54 per cent
higher in July and August 1994 than in the same period of last year, despite
supposedly tight central control.
Government economists estimate that of the 11,000 large and medium
state-enterprises, one-third are in the red, while another third barely
breaks even.
According to the SSB, in the first nine months of this year, 44.5 per cent
of SOEs have made losses. One reason is the growing competition they face
from township and village enterprises (TVEs), joint ventures and imports.
Nevertheless, 61 per cent of total fixed investment (and 23 per cent of GDP)
went into SOEs in 1993. Much of this may not be investment at all, but
rather means of disguising losses. Even where it was indeed investment, the
absence of a bankruptcy constraint means that much may be wasted. An
indication of this is that the share of SOEs in gross industrial output fell
from 65 per cent in 1985 to 48 per cent in 1992, even though their share in
gross fixed capital formation appears constant.
Beijing feeds the SOEs because they offer employment and social welfare to
more than 100m people. Whenever tightening of credit leads to an expansion
of inter-enterprise debt, the pressure to loosen control over credit becomes
formidable. This explains the relaxation of credit in late spring and summer
of 1994.
The inability of Beijing to control investment spending, combined with
growing SOE losses, is the main reason for weak discipline over public
spending. Meanwhile, political decentralisation reduced revenue, as SOEs
appropriated the profits they made and local governments took control over
fiscal revenue (see reforming the tax system, page seven).
Despite all this, most observers assume that the Chinese path of incremental
reform is stable. Hitherto, however, the contradiction between
macro-economic stability and decentralised SOE investment in the absence of
bankruptcy has been resolved by the willingness of the Chinese to hold
extraordinary amounts of money. It would be foolhardy to assume this will
last, particularly if inflation is high.
The big question is whether Beijing can make the alternatives work. Funding
fiscal deficits through borrowing on foreign and domestic markets - now
being started on a substantial scale, with issuance of more than Yn100bn (US
Dollars 12bn) in domestic securities this year - will produce an increase in
future fiscal deficits, as the interest bill rises. Positive real interest
rates on deposits, to persuade people to hold money, would undermine weaker
borrowers or increase the subsidy bill. Raising more revenue at the centre
means recentralisation of government. Last but not least, curbing credit
expansion necessitates either bankruptcy for many SOEs, or greater central
control over their activities.
The issue is, at bottom, one of re-imposing discipline, while sustaining the
impulse towards liberalisation. Further reform - to push the SOEs into the
market and bring local government within a more orderly political system -
is urgently required. The big question is political, not economic. It is
whether the Chinese government has the will and the capacity to do what is
needed.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (5): Carmakers
are the magnet - Inward investment / Paul Cheeseright traces its growing
importance

Foreign investment in the West Midlands is increasing after three years of
decline. Probably it now accounts for 20 per cent of the UK total, restoring
the region to the position it occupied in the late 1980s as the English area
most favoured by overseas companies.
Figures assembled by the West Midlands Development Agency (WMDA), the focus
of regional activity in attracting new investment, show that, in the year to
last April, foreign investment reached Pounds 652.72m, excluding the Pounds
800m takeover of Rover, the vehicle manufacturer, by BMW of Germany.
But of the 83 projects involved, 47, with a value of Pounds 309.39m, covered
expansion by foreign-owned companies already established in the regions. The
other projects were 19 acquisitions, worth Pounds 316.1m, 14 new investments
valued at Pounds 22.59m and three joint ventures.
'This year the number of projects is slightly down but capital expenditure
is ahead of the 1993-94 total,' reported Mr Paul Richards, the WMDA's chief
executive.
The high proportion of spending on company expansions underlines the
significance of foreign investment for the region.
Since 1988 foreign investment in the West Midlands has topped Pounds 2.5bn,
creating 22,000 jobs. Indeed, it is estimated that foreign-owned companies
now account for about 20 per cent of regional output.
'Unemployment in the second half of the 1980s came down faster in the West
Midlands than in the UK as a whole, because of inward investment,' said Mr
Chris Tillett, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, in Birmingham.
Further, regional surveys showed that, during the recession, overseas
companies were more inclined than indigenous companies to follow through
their investment plans. Arguably, then, they softened the impact of
recession.
The greater part of the investment is coming from traditional areas. Last
year European companies were involved in 54 per cent of the projects and
North American companies 39 per cent. The pace of Japanese investment has
slowed, while the expected growthin interest from companies in Korea and
Taiwan has not materialised.
Although the sectoral spread of investment remains wide, ranging from
electronics to food processing, the automotive sector holds predominant
importance. Three factors are at work here.
First, the expansion of car assembly in the UK is drawing in suppliers
wishing to be closer to their customers. Second, overseas companies are
using the West Midlands, a vehicle manufacturing area, as a platform from
which to enter the wider European Union market. Third, cost patterns have
been shifting within the European auto industry.
'Not only is the UK cheap, but the West Midlands is even cheaper,' noted Mr
Tillett.
The US department of labour calculated that average total labour costs per
hour in the UK are Dollars 11, against Dollars 15 in the US, Dollars 16 in
France and Dollars 22 in Germany. Coopers &amp; Lybrand noted that average gross
male earnings in the West Midlands are 92 per cent of the UK average. It
assessed that operating costs of a typical Coventry plant would be less than
two thirds those of a German plant.
The drive against inflated costs has induced German car manufacturers like
Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen to widen the geographical sourcing of their
components. At the same time, the level of West Midlands costs has made it
feasible for their traditional suppliers to consider setting up operations
in the region.
Yet there is no guarantee that the stronger flow of inward investment will
continue. Costs are only one factor in an increasingly competitive race to
secure new employment. This is a race which sets country against country,
region against region, and even within a region, district against district.
The latest figures from the WMDA are the first since the government revised
the boundaries on its map of assisted areas and the European Commission
defined the areas which it considered qualified for aid. This has meant that
Telford, a focus for investment since the mid-1980s, and a number of other
locations, no longer have the opportunity to offer subsidies to incoming
companies at the level of past years.
This has made little difference so far. The easy access to greenfield sites
and the comfort to be derived by incoming companies from the presence of
their peers has led to what Mr David Rogerson, director of the Telford
Development Agency, described as 'the highest level of inquiries during the
last few months we've ever had'.
In the first half of this year, seven foreign companies established
themselves in Telford, compared with 11 in the whole of 1993 and nine in the
whole of 1992.
Yet 60 per cent of the jobs created or safeguarded by foreign investment in
the West Midlands were in the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation during
the year to last April.
The competitive attractions within the region may be changing. Land assembly
programmes of government agencies are coming to fruition. They have led, for
example, to the Black Country Development Corporation's planned automotive
components park and the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation's
proposal for a new business park on land purchased from Leyland Daf Vans.
Space is becoming available in the conurbation where there was none before.
This is good news for the WMDA, because it widens the range of site
possibilities it can offer to potential investors. Inward investment
agencies are searching for new services which can be provided for incoming
companies, not only to help them but to link them in to the local network of
suppliers.
'Inward investment used to be about a piece of land. Now it's much more a
company saying, 'What resources have you got to support my business?'' said
Mr Richards. Meeting this sort of demand, acknowledging that sustaining
companies which have already set up can be just as significant as drawing in
new arrivals, is likely to change the WMDA.
New forms of collaboration between local agencies in the West Midlands,
partly in response to the growing role of training and enterprise councils,
should diminish the reliance of the WMDA on the department of trade and
industry, its prime source of funding, and the local authorities.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (4): The
community has its say - Partnerships are not new. Hazel Duffy examines their
evolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Partnerships are on the increase, spurred by a government that has made them
a pre-requisite in the competitive bidding process for regeneration money.
There is nothing new about the concept. In the 1970s, the partnership was
between central and local government, the former channelling money through
local authorities to be spent on physical renewal.
During the 1980s, the word was applied by Mrs Thatcher to a relationship
between the public and private sectors. A further dimension was added as a
result of the corporate sector's involvement with voluntary agencies and
schools - for instance, to bring extra resources to areas of economic and
social deprivation.
The 1990s has seen the birth of the training and enterprise councils (Tecs),
requiring yet another sort of partnership between central government, which
finances most of their activities, and local companies. And with the City
Challenge programme, whereby local authorities co-ordinated a number of
agencies to put a bid for money to government, the community became formally
involved.
The community is now represented on many of the 37 partnerships across the
West Midlands region, which are waiting to hear if they have been successful
in capturing a slice of the Single Regeneration Budget. These partnerships
are variously led and co-ordinated by local councils, voluntary agencies,
higher education, and Tecs.
Some partnerships have economic stimulus as their objective. Coventry city
council, for instance, has teamed up with surrounding local authorities to
form an embryo 'city region', bringing more potential development sites into
the catchment area than could be produced in the city itself.
It is hoped that this approach will bring increased opportunities to seek
money from Europe, as well as from the government through such agencies as
English Partnerships, which will be responsible for City Grant and money to
restore derelict land. Coventry also hopes that the private sector, with
seven seats on the board of the partnership company, will be encouraged to
bring forward investment plans.
The private sector is in a leading position on partnerships in several other
areas, including Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Burton and Cannock,
which have put in bids to the government.
The role which corporate leaders - many of whom are already involved in Tecs
 -and other partners will take in the implementation of some of the schemes
emerging from successful bids is less clear. Even where schemes have a
specific economic, rather than social, goal, the local authority is likely
to emerge as the partner that ensures things get done.
Chief executives sometimes fulfil a largely symbolic role, yet they are
easier to bring into the partnership circle than representatives of the
community, says Steve Martin, research fellow in the local government centre
at Warwick Business School Centre. Moreover, community representatives often
do not represent all parts of the community, and some use it as a platform
which could get them out of the area.
'What is important in all partnerships is that each partner brings something
distinctive into it. In that way, they can avoid clashes over turf,' says Mr
Martin.
Current government thinking is that publicly funded schemes should
demonstrate that they will benefit the community. The four City Challenges
in the region - in Walsall, Wolverhampton, Tipton and Birmingham - all want
to get property development schemes off the ground, whether they centre on a
supermarket, a science park, housing or a combination of all three. This
brings the potential developer into the partnership as well. But it has to
be demonstrated that these plans will include extra activities, such as
training and childcare, so that local people have a chance to get work.
The short-term nature of government programmes set up to address long-term
problems of unemployment and social deprivation points to the need to
identify the people - the partners - who will take on the mantle after the
agencies are wound up.
The two urban development corporations in the area, Black Country and
Birmingham Heartlands, are already preparing for their demise. They have
taken on some responsibility for other publicly funded schemes that no
longer exist, like the government's task force in East Birmingham. But they
have only short lives ahead of them, so must foster arrangements for the
future.
Some partnerships will be adaptable, others might not survive beyond the
immediate purpose for which many were set up. Local government has been
pushed into the partnership mode by the very fact that it does not have the
resources these days to strike out on its own. But councils across the
region will probably prove to be the mainstay of many of these partnerships,
because they are still better geared up to make things happen at the local
level. They are also the only democratically elected element in
partnerships.
Birmingham, in particular, has had much experience with partnerships. Some
councillors would like the Heartlands area to return to the sort of
development agency partnership between private contractors and the city
council which existed before the government turned it into a development
corporation. But it would have to be adapted for the mid-1990s, which would
suggest more partners than originally.
The chamber of commerce has played an important role in city partnerships
with an economic slant, and, with the Tec and the council, initiated one of
the first Business Links in the country.
Local government is having to be adaptable in working with others, in order
to satisfy the European structural funds' masters, who want the emphasis to
be on the region and sub-regions rather than individual councils.
Partnership similarly requires a degree of agility if it is to make a real
impact. The more partners there are, the greater the skill that is needed to
reconcile what is attainable with over-ambitious goals.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (3): Relations with US improve - Diplomacy
has been a key factor this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, addressed the US Council on
foreign relations in New York recently, he spoke with more self-assurance
about diplomatic achievements than might have been possible earlier in the
year.
Mr Qian also pursued a theme that is fast becoming a staple of public
utterances by Chinese leaders on a range of subjects from Gatt membership to
regional security. It is that China, because of its growing economic weight,
expects to play a much expanded role in a complex and unstable world.
'People with vision have come to realise that the world needs China for
peace, stability and prosperity just as China needs the world,' he said.
As 1994 draws to a close, there is no doubt this has been a successful year
for Chinese diplomacy with Beijing further distancing itself from the bloody
events of 1989 in which the military turned its guns on student
pro-democracy protesters.
The US agreement in mid-year to sever the link between renewal of China's
Most Favoured Nation status and human rights issues represented a
significant breakthrough.
Relations with the US have improved markedly as a consequence, although
irritations continue over issues ranging from Washington's decision to
upgrade ties with Taiwan to terms for China's re-entry to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Among tangible signs of improvement
was the joint Sino-US statement in October on 'Missile Proliferation' in
which the two sides agreed to work together to halt proliferation of
missiles. They also resolved to co-operate in efforts to achieve an end to
the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons.
In return for China's agreement to support a global ban on exports of
missiles under the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR),
the US lifted sanctions on the export of high technology items.
Since the disastrous visit to Beijing early this year of Mr Warren
Christopher, the US Secretary of State, marked by an unseemly wrangle over
human rights, a steady stream of senior Americans has passed through the
Chinese capital; among them, Mr Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary and Mr
William Perry, the Defence Secretary.
The latter was the first visit to China of a US Defence Secretary since 1989
and yielded agreement on enhanced military consultations, and co-operation
in such fields as defence conversion. The two sides did not address the
issue of the continued US embargo on military aid to China imposed after
June, 1989.
The growing frequency of Sino-US exchanges indicates that the two are bent
on building a more constructive relationship in both the commercial and
political and security spheres. This is consistent with the Clinton
administration's desire to re-focus its China policy in ways that make it
less susceptible to human rights pressures.
China would also be well satisfied with broader foreign policy developments.
The defusing, for the time being, of the North Korean nuclear crisis
represented a success for Chinese diplomacy which had striven behind the
scenes to avoid a sanctions process and, worse, the crisis spiralling out of
control.
In a way, the North Korea issue provided a textbook case of Beijing's
cautious foreign policy approach. China prefers quiet diplomacy to
confrontation on most issues with the notable exception of questions
involving Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and human rights.
This much reflects the low-key non-ideological personal style of Foreign
Minister Qian as it does Beijing's desire to be regarded as a good neighbour
in its own region and a constructive player globally.
China, for the moment, appears sensitive to regional concerns about its
growing economic strength, although Beijing's uncompromising pursuit of its
claim to disputed islands and surrounding waters in the South China Sea
risks confrontation, principally with Vietnam, see report, this page.
The Spratlys issue is one of the irritants most often cited as an argument
for the further development of a regional security consensus, but here again
Beijing is cautious. While officials see merit in dialogue they are
sceptical of grander schemes such as Europe's CSCE framework.
This caution extends to Beijing's approach to the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum (APEC). While China sees merit in APEC, it is not ready,
at this stage, to embrace the grouping wholeheartedly as much more than a
consultative forum.
Among China's concerns is that APEC itself might develop into a trading bloc
in competition with other groupings, including the European Community.
China, whose trading ambitions are almost boundless, is understandably
against the idea of the world being divided into competing economic spheres.
Apart from the US, China has also witnessed in the past months an
improvement in its relations with key European powers, including Germany and
France.
The visit to France by President Jiang Zemin in September followed a period
of coolness over French arms sales to Taiwan, but the issue was defused
earlier this year when France agreed to place a moratorium on new weapons
business.
China's relations with the Russian Federation have also been improving,
culminating with the visit to Moscow in the autumn by Mr Jiang. This
resulted in a series of framework economic agreements designed to propel the
relationship into the next century. The two sides also agreed to stop
targeting each other with nuclear weapons and to further reduce the
deployment of troops on their lengthy common boundary.
The one really jarring element of China's international relationships, apart
from ongoing human rights pressures, remains the row over Hong Kong governor
Chris Patten's attempts to broaden democracy, and the effect this is having
on Sino-British ties.
At this stage, there seems little prospect of an end to the friction and its
negative impact on relations between Beijing and London. The 1,000 or so
days between now and 1997 promise a bumpy ride.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (2): The long wait for heaven's mandate - A
transitional stage in politics as rival groups vie to succeed Deng
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was hardly a ringing declaration of self-confidence in the future, and
for that reason it was revealing of the political uncertainties that prevail
in China as the nation waits for its paramount ruler to die and worries
about the transition from one generation of leaders to the next.
The resolution of the fourth plenary session of the 14th Central Committee
of September 28 laid heavy emphasis on strengthening Communist Party
institutions and rooting out corruption. Its message was one of
consolidation, in marked contrast to the decisions of the third plenum,
twelve months earlier, which had resolved to embark on an ambitious
programme of economic reform.
'The Party must be capable of recognising, enhancing and upgrading itself
under the new situation of reform and of opening-up, and must
conscientiously study and solve the new contradictions and new problems that
crop up in the course of its self-building,' said the resolution.
China's 'third generation' of leaders, as they are known in official
parlance, find themselves in the uncomfortable situation of being expected
to get on with asserting leadership, while at the same time remaining
mindful of the fact that an old man of failing health is still the arbiter
when it comes to important decisions - although it is not clear whether it
is Mr Deng himself or those who are purporting to speak for him who are
actually wielding authority.
Mr Deng's health may have deteriorated to the point where his ability to
monitor developments is very limited, but until he dies the 'mandate of
heaven' cannot pass to his chosen successors. This is in spite of the fact
that much has been made recently of the old man's confidence in the new
generation with President Jiang Zemin at its 'core.'
China, as it awaits Mr Deng's demise, is embroiled in a process of
'transitional politics' with various factions manoeuvring for power and
influence in preparation for the post-Deng era. Thus, personnel changes at
the top increasingly are seen through a prism of what they mean for the
power balance after Deng.
President Jiang Zemin, who also holds concurrently the positions of general
secretary of the Communist Party and chairman of the Military Commission,
appears to have been bolstering his position over the past year or so with
key appointments to the party and military, and to the security apparatus.
A thread running through these appointments is that the officials brought to
Beijing were associated with Mr Jiang in his days in the 1980s in Shanghai
when he served as mayor and then party secretary. This has given rise to
talk of a 'Shanghai faction' in the leadership, but such an assessment may
prove to be simplistic since many leading figures with a Shanghai
connection, including Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier in charge of the
economy (Mr Zhu was, like Mr Jiang, mayor and party boss of Shanghai) are
not so easily pigeon-holed.
With Mr Deng's demise drawing nearer and with the leadership in something of
a state of flux it will almost certainly take time after his departure from
the scene for a clearer picture to emerge of the strength of the various key
participants and, more importantly perhaps, of the trends which they
represent.
The principal actors at this stage include Mr Jiang himself, Premier Li
Peng, Mr Zhu and Mr Qiao Shi, the enigmatic chairman of the standing
committee of the National People's Congress and third ranking figure on the
seven-member standing committee of the ruling Politburo. But waiting in the
wings are others who can be expected to make their bids for a share of power
in the post-Deng phase.
Mindful of the fact that Mr Deng's reformist legacy will almost certainly
come in for a buffeting once he goes, the authorities have, for much of this
year, been seeking to reinforce the message that there can be no turning
back, but at the same time they have mounted a campaign aimed at reminding
people that economic reform does not equate with political liberalisation.
People's Daily, in a commentary echoing the theme of September's central
committee meeting, stressed adherence to democratic centralism, a
code-phrase for continued rigid party control, and rejected what it
described as the doctrine of extreme democracy - the phrase employed by
Chinese propaganda to impugn Western-style democracy.
'We must perfect democratic centralism and associated policies, so that
there is no change because of a change in leadership, and no change because
of a change in the leaders' views or focuses of attention,' People's Daily
said pointedly.
Indications that Mr Deng's legacy, which is meant to serve China for the
next 100 years, will be far from immune from attack came with publication
earlier this year of a controversial book whose author has thus far not been
identified publicly. The book, Looking at China Through a Third Eye
expresses the heretical notion that Mr Deng's policies of explosive economic
growth have led China into a trap in which socialist values were crumbling,
and the ability of the authorities to exert control over a restless and
disaffected peasantry was weakening.
Publication of such criticism, especially in the present climate of
unadorned official praise for Mr Deng, was surprising, but it does indicate
a certain level of opposition. Party conservatives unhappy with the excesses
of the economic transformation, and ideologues who fear a withering of
socialism - with or without Chinese characteristics - can be expected to be
more outspoken in the post-Deng period.
Criticism from party dissidents, who have been biding their time until Deng
passes from the scene, may well provide an early test of the resolve of the
leadership group. China's post-Deng collective, deprived of the ability to
speak on behalf of a higher authority, will have to find new ways of dealing
efficiently with internal dissent.
Apart from Mr Deng's anointed successor, it will be the veteran officers of
the People's Liberation Army who will play a crucial role in the next phase.
Although the army has undergone a fairly rapid professionalisation, and thus
the introduction of younger officers to its senior ranks since the late
1970s, old-guard commanders still hold sway.
President Jiang Zemin's chairmanship of the Central Military Commission (the
most powerful body in China aside from the Politburo standing committee) is
under-pinned by the presence as vice-chairman on the commission of two Red
Army stalwarts and Long March veterans - General Liu Huaqing, 78, and
General Zhang Zhen, 80.
Their role, and that of other revolutionary commanders, will be critical in
resolving factional struggles post-Deng. In preparation for the transition
and to assure continuity the word has been put out that Generals Liu and
Zhang will continue in their posts for the time being.
The army and security apparatus has been standing by for months to
crack-down on any sign of trouble after Mr Deng goes. Security will
certainly be at the top of the list of concerns in the immediate post-Deng
era.
Indeed, General Zhang is reported to have stressed at a recent meeting of
the Central Military Commission the need for absolute loyalty of the army to
the party in the next phase. His address also laid heavy emphasis on the
need to maintain stability in the army itself and in the nation at this
time. These will remain standard themes in these skittish times.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (4): Spratly Islands row heats up - Dispute
over offshore oil and gas resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is possible that a group a submerged reefs in the South China Sea could
be the site of the world's next big conflict involving the ownership of oil
resources.
At issue is the ownership of the Spratly Islands and their surrounding seas
which are claimed, in whole or part, by China, Vietnam, the Philippines,
Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan.
The main protagonists in the dispute are, however, China and Vietnam. They
have come to blows once - in 1988 when China sank two Vietnamese vessels
with the loss of more than 70 lives - and continue to frustrate each other's
attempts to mine the oil and gas believed to be in liberal supply below the
sea.
The South China Sea is one of the world's most important shipping lanes. The
possibility of a naval conflict over sovereignty would engage the vital
interests of Japan - 70 per cent of its oil imports pass through the sea -
and surrounding claimants. The US, which is not taking sides, would
inevitably become involved if hostilities broke out  - 'the Chinese
government's position is clear,' says Chen Bingqin, vice-president, China
National Offshore Oil Corp. 'We want to put the dispute on the shelf and
explore (for oil and gas) jointly. It is the only way peacefully to explore
the area.'
On the question of sovereignty, a senior Chinese government official was
adamant: 'Sovereignty belongs to China and that's a matter that brooks no
discussion.'
China claims that there was never any dispute about its sovereignty in the
South China Sea until oil and gas were discovered in the 1970s. The Spratly
Islands are too far south to show on the above map of China. The size of
Beijing's territorial claim - 80 per cent of the South China Sea - is
breathtakingly audacious, even by China's standards. The U-shaped claim runs
the length of Vietnam's coast and along the western coast of the Philippine
islands, meeting off the coast of Brunei and Malaysia to the south.
In 1990, Beijing offered to put the issue of sovereignty to one side and
embark upon joint development of the South China Sea. But in May 1992, China
awarded Crestone, a relatively small US oil explorer, the right to drill for
hydrocarbons in a bloc situated at the extreme south-west of its claimed
territory.
In retaliation, Vietnam awarded a consortium of oil companies, led by Mobil
of the US, a bloc adjacent to Crestone's and within China's territorial
claim. This group began prospecting in June.
Both countries have offered naval support to their respective prospectors.
In June the Vietnamese navy interfered with a Chinese vessel conducting a
seismic survey of Crestone's bloc. The Vietnamese claim similar interference
by the Chinese navy. For China, which is likely to remain a net oil importer
for many years to come, the promise of abundant oil reserves in the South
China Sea would be a boon to its offshore oil industry.
Since 1982, offshore oil finds in the Yellow and East China seas have failed
to live up to early expectations. This year the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation expects to produce 44m barrels of oil from 12 fields. It hopes
to double production by 1997 when other areas come on stream.
Vietnam, by contrast, is extracting 33m barrels a year from one field in the
South China Sea, with production set to rise sharply with the addition of
two more oil fields in production by the end of this year.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (2): Services
provide the jobs - Exports are leading the region out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the UK pulls haltingly out of recession, there is more confidence around
in the West Midlands, which, as home to a large concentration of
manufacturing industry, is particularly encouraged by the strength of
exports.
In the last few years, unemployment has fallen more quickly than in the UK
as a whole because of inward investment, which to some extent diluted the
region's dependence on a small group of large producers. The region also
boasts highly competitive wage rates, and the differential with the rest of
the UK is growing.
But the optimism is tempered by concern about that continuing dependence on
manufacturing. It has exaggerated the impact of the last two recessions in
the region, with unemployment rising more sharply at the start of each, and
recovering more quickly at the end than in the UK as a whole.
Mr David Ritchie, regional director for the Government Office of the West
Midlands, insists that manufacturing has to be underpinned: 'No advanced
economy has survived without a manufacturing base. If this country is going
to become competitive, it has to have a manufacturing base.'
Birmingham alone still has 128,000 people working in manufacturing, in spite
of diversification.
There have been huge improvements in competitiveness among the region's
larger companies, such as the big vehicle assemblers - which represent 30
per cent of the region's GDP, against 8.5 per cent for the UK as a whole.
But there is still a long way to go among the small and medium companies -
the foundry industry is seen as a sector where improvement is particularly
needed.
The close ties of much of the region's economy to the motor industry promise
a challenge to the region in the longer term, with increasing competition
from the Far East and from other parts of Europe.
As Mr Martin Booth, chief economist at the West Midlands Enterprise Board,
points out, manufacturers are always going to look at where they can get the
best deal in assembling new models.
The UK has done well in this respect, aided by the low level of the sterling
exchange rate and the competitive work practices stimulated by Japanese
transplants.
But, says Mr Booth, as eastern Europe develops, countries such as Hungary
and Poland could compete for new car plants.
And since the sale of Rover Group to BMW of Germany, there is no large
UK-controlled car maker, and all strategic decisions are taken outside the
UK.
Current growth is also benefiting the components sector. with the big
assemblers working increasingly closely with first-tier suppliers.
The relationship, dependent on quality and price, is based on component
prices continuing to fall, which is less easy to achieve if volumes stop
growing.
Mr Chris Tillett, a principal with accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
Birmingham, says that West Midlands industry is more vulnerable than the
rest of the UK to the effects of increased competition within the European
single market, revisions to Gatt and to changes in the distribution system.
As an example, he cites the increasing internationalisation of retailing,
with companies such as household products group, Ikea, able to supply its
growing market share in ceramic products - an important industry around
Stoke-on-Trent - from a range of international suppliers. West Midlands
companies, which tend to be small, are less well placed to compete in
international markets.
Some of the forecasts are enormously depressing. Ereaco, the European
research organisation, says employment in manufacturing will drop by 6.4 per
cent a year until 1997 in the West Midlands.
But research also shows the region doing well in services and with a
location quotient - a measure of how desirable it is perceived to be as a
business location - above the UK average.
There is also a growing pocket of electronics companies around Telford; and
Wolverhampton and parts of Birmingham are competitive in what they can
provide in regional assistance.
Most commentators expect any employment growth to come in services such as
retailing, and that therefore the region's economy will become more
dependent on lower-waged and part-time jobs.
A recent report from the Birmingham Economic Information Centre - run by the
city council and the training and enterprise council - said starkly:
'Relatively high levels of unemployment, leading to serious social and
economic deprivation in some parts of the city, are likely to persist for
many years to come. These problems represent a further constraint on local
economic growth as they depress levels of consumer spending power.'
There may be less help available from diversification which, says Mr Booth,
was helped in the 1980s by service companies moving out of London - for
instance, the TSB head office move to Birmingham and Barclays Bank's
back-office functions to Coventry. The property and labour cost pressure for
such moves has now eased.
Mr Booth also points to the region's shortage of greenfield sites - he
doubted whether any site available in the West Midlands could have taken the
Toyota plant which went to Burnaston in Derbyshire. A number of 'brownfield'
sites are being reclaimed, but some investors, notably those from the US,
are wary of sites whichthey fear could bring nasty surprises.
The region also has a poor recent record in new company formation. The
number of VAT-registered businesses in the UK rose 33 per cent between 1979
and 1990 - the figure for the region was 24 per cent and for Birmingham just
9 per cent.
There are bright spots in the region. Coventry, says Mr Tillett, is 'holding
its own,' as is Solihull; while Warwickshire is forecast to have one of the
fastest growth rates in the UK over the next few years.
Also doing well are the smaller centres to the south and west of Birmingham
 -Redditch, Kidderminster, Worcester, Telford. Like Birmingham, Stoke is
struggling and Burton has suffered from a shakeout in the brewing and food
industries.
The region faces considerable challenges in its drive towards urban renewal.
New manufacturing needs to be attracted, local companies need to gear up to
win contracts from the inward investors who are setting up plants in the
region and, perhaps most importantly, local industry must invest and develop
to meet the increasing competitive pressures from elsewhere.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (3): Grants are
the remedy for region's needs - Regeneration needs public funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAZEL DUFFY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seen from Brussels, the West Midlands is one of the poorer regions of the
European Union. Viewed from Whitehall, its gross domestic product falls
below the UK average, and its inner cities register some of the worst
poverty in the country.
These are uncomfortable facts that detract from the messages put out by the
promoters that the region is the manufacturing heart of Britain, which has
attracted substantial inward investment and whose principal city,
Birmingham, sells itself as the meeting place of Europe.
Both claims can be substantiated. Yet to assume that all of the region is
rundown and its people poor would be erroneous. It is increasingly urban -
or rather, suburban - with pockets of wealth in those parts of the shire
counties that are within commuting distance of the conurbation.
On the other hand, the extremities of these counties (except Warwickshire)
have recently been designated by the European Commission as rural areas in
need of development (Objective 5b).
Coming back into the centre, the unemployment blight in Birmingham and
Wolverhampton was acknowledged by the government, which gave them
development-area status.
What all this will add up to in terms of regeneration and the region's
economy will depend largely on the response of the private sector.
The Department of Trade and Industry is encouraged that grant approvals are
running at a higher level than last year (136, against 91). Grant money adds
up to Pounds 21.3m so far in 1994-5, compared with Pounds 14.1m for the same
period of 1993-4. Recovery in the manufacturing sector explains some of the
increase in demand. The new development-area status also seems particularly
to have caught the eye of Birmingham business.
Jaguar Cars easily tops the list for the size of grant approved in the
region. The two plants - Castle Bromwich in Birmingham, and Browns Lane in
Coventry - will share Pounds 9.4m towards upgrading facilities to produce
the X100. The fact that the Birmingham plant could qualify for the higher
rate of assistance helped to win the project for Britain against
international competition, and to secure it in the West Midlands against
Ford (Jaguar's owner) plants in other parts of the country, according to the
DTI. The grant was approved because it would safeguard jobs rather than
create new ones.
Regeneration of the old industrial and inner-city areas is also closely
linked to the response of the private sector - developers, manufacturers and
service producers. Most of the government's programmes have been brought
under the umbrella of the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) since the start
of the current financial year. The whole region, however, is eligible to
apply. Bids submitted this autumn are now being assessed. If all of the bids
were successful, some Pounds 40m would be paid out. Considering that the
total SRB for England is Pounds 100m, there will have to be some
scaling-down of expectations.
As government spending gets tighter, Brussels is the real honey-pot for the
region's needs. Much of the older, urban section of the region has been
retained as eligible for European Regional Development Fund support
(Objective 2). (Telford and Stoke-on-Trent were not deemed to be in need any
longer). The three-year allocation, to December 1996, for these areas is
Pounds 287m. Redundant coalfield areas scattered around the region have also
qualified for European money, to assist development and training.
The European Commission's aim is to help the poorer regions of the EU to
come closer to the average regional profile. So it wanted a plan not just
for bits and pieces of the West Midlands, but for the region overall. In the
absence of any regional government institutions such as exist in Germany,
France and Italy, the West Midlands Regional Forum of Local Authorities
pulled together the plethora of ideas and programmes into a coherent
overview of the region's needs until the end of the decade.
The progress of the current Brussels round marks the end of the so-called
integrated operations programmes, which tended to favour industrial cities
and sub-regions. Birmingham, which did well from the structural funds to
support its city-centre renewal programme, expects to find it tougher in the
current session.
Consequently the government's City Pride exercise, which Birmingham,
Manchester and London are competing for, is all the more important. It is
not clear, however, whether Whitehall intends to fund City Pride from the
Single Regeneration Budget, in which case these cities could lose other
funding.
European money has to be matched by funds from other sources. With local
government capital spending severely constrained, Brussels increasingly
supports projects where the other part of the funds come from urban
development corporations, such as City Challenge. The aim of these bodies is
to maximise the Euro-content by putting together schemes which incorporate
support from the European Social Fund - for training largely - and other
European sources.
Brussels' support for alternative economic development in the more marginal
rural areas in the West Midlands totals Pounds 32m, which puts it among the
most successful bids in the more developed members of the EU, and is
substantially complemented by the government's rural development area
programme. Money can also be applied for to help add value to agricultural
products. The Brussels pot might yield a little extra for the inner cities,
and the region is also pushing to be included on the list of areas whose
rail networks might qualify for extra help.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (1): Reform momentum slows down - As China
proceeds further down the road of economic reform, the task is becoming more
complicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After two years of spectacular economic progress, China is entering a winter
of unease. The reform momentum is slowing, there are worries about inflation
and worker unrest, and the prospect of transition to a new leadership when
Deng Xiaoping dies, is weighing more heavily.
Officials insist that there will be no let-up in the reforms, but it is
clear that China has embarked on a period of consolidation in its economic
transformation following recent advances.
Concern about the deteriorating health of Deng is casting a long shadow.
China is now enmeshed in the transition to a post-Deng era, re-inforcing a
mood of caution among the leadership group.
In the short-term, however, worries about inflation are proving the most
burdensome for the authorities, who have made the fight against rising
prices their main priority.
Chinese leaders have been predicting for much of 1994 that price increases
would slow, but in spite of a stiffening of price controls earlier this year
the underlying inflation rate remains stubbornly high. Consumer prices leapt
by 27.4 per cent in the twelve months to September, and were up by two
percentage points on August.
The government is also finding the task of reforming state enterprises more
challenging and politically riskier than expected. The planned
implementation this year of a programme to rationalise 100 enterprises in 18
cities, including a pilot bankruptcy scheme, has been postponed until next
year, because of fears of worker unrest, especially in China's restive
north-east industrial heartland.
The official jobless rate among industrial workers stands at 2.4 per cent,
but this vastly understates the problem of both unemployment and
under-employment, which is running as high as 20 per cent in some urban
areas.
Sluggish activity in the state sector, which accounts for about 45 per cent
of industrial production, has raised the spectre of 'stagflation' in an
economy that is decelerating. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to about
10 per cent next year, compared with 13.4 per cent in 1993 and an expected
11.5 per cent this year. Since the introduction of a 16-point stabilisation
programme in July 1993, the government has instituted a series of stop-go
attempts at restraining monetary growth to calm an overheating economy,
loosening and tightening credit in alternate three-month cycles.
Persistent demands for working capital from ailing state enterprises, half
of which are operating in the red, have greatly complicated efforts to
restrain monetary growth.
But while China faces enormous challenges in managing its transition, from a
centrally-planned monolith to a market-oriented system, the economic news is
far from being uniformly poor.
Foreign investors continued to target China, pledging some US Dollars 57bn
worth of new investment in the first nine months of the year. Actual
investment totalled Dollars 22.72bn, an increase of 49 per cent over last
year. China now absorbs about half of all foreign direct investment to
developing countries worldwide.
Trade figures so far for 1994 are no less impressive. Exports rebounded
strongly after growth slowed last year. In the first three-quarters of 1994,
exports exceeded imports by Dollars 1.38bn, compared with last year's trade
deficit of Dollars 12.2bn.
In line with its much-improved trading performance, China's foreign exchange
reserves grew strongly in the first half of the year, to stand at Dollars
39.83bn at the end of September, a 87 per cent increase on 1993. The
continued buoyant performance of township and village enterprises was
another bright spot.
Yet, although economic issues have dominated the public agenda this year, it
is concern about Mr Deng's health which is preoccupying the leadership, and
deepening the new mood of caution. Heirs to the throne wish to avoid any
false steps in this delicate transitional phase.
At the fourth plenary session of the 14th central committee held in
September, the Communist Party emphasised themes of stability rather than
reform in a resolution titled 'Major Issues on Strengthening Party
Building.' This was hardly a ringing endorsement of the reform process:
instead it indicated that the leadership was preparing for difficult times
expected ahead.
The fourth plenum resolution stood in marked contrast to that of the third
plenum of November, 1993 which approved a blueprint for sweeping economic
changes, including reforms of the financial sector and guidance for the
corporatisation - a Chinese half-way house to privatisation - of state
enterprises.
Slow progress in these areas in the 12 months since the third plenum
reflects a new, more hesitant mood which has been prompted by concerns about
rising prices, unrest among the unemployed, agitation by peasants whose
incomes have been squeezed by rising costs, greater incidence of crime
across the country, and worries about the leadership transition.
Added to that is the fact that as China proceeds further down the road of
economic reform and in the process seeks closer integration with the world
economy, the task becomes more complicated. Not least of the difficulties is
marrying the country's own evolving trading laws and regulations with those
of the outside world.
Presiding over this extraordinarily complex transition, in place of Mr
Deng's generation of revolutionaries, will be a new, more technocratic cadre
whose capacity to deal with the serious challenges which lie ahead in
governing the world's most populous state is largely untested.
China's new generation of leaders may be able to defer for the time being
consideration of contentious issues such as the need for greater
accountability, but continued economic liberalisation is certain to increase
demands for a more representative system. Real political reform, as opposed
to tinkering with party institutions, cannot be excluded indefinitely from
the debate.
While progress in economic reform has been patchy, there have been some
impressive advances in foreign policy. President Clinton's decision in May
to uncouple human rights issues from an extension of China's most favoured
nation trading status in the US represented a victory for Chinese diplomacy,
though human rights lobby groups were outraged.
Relations with the US have improved markedly in the past six months, with
frequent exchanges of high level visitors and growing collaboration in a
range of areas - from regional security to global arms control.
The agreement reached in October between the US and China to co-operate in
efforts aimed at halting the spread of missile technology and fissionable
nuclear materials was a significant development.
Chinese officials regard 1994 as a year during which Beijing placed greater
distance between itself and the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in
Tiananmen square in 1989. Sanctions are still in place in the West against
the sale of military hardware, but the Tiananmen issue as an irritant to
relations with the international community has receded into the background.
China's foreign policy aspirations for the year would be more than fulfilled
if success were achieved in its difficult negotiations on re-entry to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, (see page five in this survey).
Gatt-entry, and the benefits which would accrue in consequence, would
provide a fillip for a regime seeking positive economic news to counter some
of the less positive developments of the latter part of the year.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (1):
Manufacturers matter again - The region is moving smoothly out of recession
 -and traditional industries are leading the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When delegates to the annual conference of the Confederation of British
Industry approach the International Convention Centre in Birmingham this
morning, they will see the evidence of a publicly-funded exercise in
economic diversification.
The centre, along with the National Exhibition Centre and the nearby
National Indoor Arena, represent an attempt by civic leaders to demonstrate
that there is more to Birmingham than its traditional position as the UK's
industrial heartland.
Yet it is the traditional industries - the engineering and automotive
companies - that have led the West Midlands out of recession.
Surveys from regional chambers of commerce have reported a steady rise in
the proportion of manufacturing companies with fatter export order-books.
Service companies, on the other hand, saw the growth in export orders
flatten out in the middle of the year. For both manufacturing and services,
the flow of domestic orders slowed in the second and third quarters.
Apart from exceptions such as companies tied to the aerospace and
construction sectors, there has been a rise in ouput. But there is scope for
more. 'One of the concerns is whether the chancellor of the exchequer is
trying to slow down growth because of capacity constraints, but nobody I've
talked to has got capacity constraints,' said Mr David Probert, chairman of
W. Canning, the chemicals company and president of the Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce.
Notwithstanding such reservations, the region is moving out of recession
with relative smoothness, and economic forecasters agree that, in the short
and medium term at least, growth is likely to be at or near the national
average. Oxford Economic Forecasting and Northern Ireland Economic Research
Centre, for example, estimate that gross domestic product across the West
Midlands will expand in 1995 by 3.4 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent for
the UK.
The longer-term future is more difficult to predict, and the question of
finding the economic balance between manufacturing and services remains.
Manufacturing is the mainstay of regional wealth but not the source of jobs:
indeed, Ereaco, the European research organisation, forecasts a 6.7 per cent
fall in the region's manufacturing employment every year until 1997.
Although output from the services sector in Birmingham, the regional centre,
is forecast by the Birmingham Economic Information Centre to grow 4.1 per
cent a year until 1997 and 3.9 per cent a year until the year 2005, job
expansion over the same periods is predicted at 1.78 per cent and 1.38 per
cent respectively.
The services sector - through the development of, for example, the complex
that houses the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention
Centre and the National Indoor Arena and its associated business tourism;
the Merry Hill shopping centre; and back office facilities in Coventry - has
created an impetus of its own since the early 1980s. Both financial and
business services have expanded.
But none of this has been sufficient to remove manufacturing from its
pivotal position in the regional economy. What was deemed a weakness in the
1980s, when fashionable thinking downplayed manufacturing as a source of
growth and looked to services as the basis of expansion in an advanced
economy, is now deemed a strength.
'No advanced economy has survived without a manufacturing base,' said Mr
David Ritchie, regional director for the Government office of the West
Midlands. 'If this country is going to become competitive in any realistic
sense in the future, it has to have a manufacturing base.' The UK government
is so keen to advance manufacturing that it is planning a celebration of
industrial achievement in the West Midlands next year.
For manufacturing in Britain to prosper, Birmingham and the West Midlands
must thrive. Figures from the 1991 census of production showed that, in
terms of gross value added during the manufacturing process, Birmingham was
by far the strongest centre in the UK. Coventry was third; Sandwell, in the
Black Country, was fifth, Stoke-on-Trent 11th and Wolverhampton 14th.
In any event, the futures of the manufacturing and services sectors in the
region cannot be disentangled. A report for the CBI, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
accountants, noted that 40 per cent of jobs for men and 16 per cent of jobs
for women were directly dependent on manufacturing, with much of the service
industry base directly dependent on supporting manufacturing activity.
The difficulty is that the manufacturing sector, after the retrenchment set
off by the 1980s recession and the rationalisation caused by the 1990s
recession, is too small for comfort, suggested Mr David Botterill, chief
executive of the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands.
'What is there is infinitely healthier. It's much stronger, more alive and
more internationally competitive. It's made considerable inroads into
European markets,' he said.
Sharp cost differentials have emerged between UK engineering companies and
their continental European competitors. They have enhanced the ability of
West Midlands engineering companies to supply components to, for example,
German car manufacturers. 'To penetrate French and German markets it used to
be virtually essential to have a plant there. Now they are prepared to buy
from outside,' said Mr Probert.
At the same time, the existence of the cost differentials has helped speed
the flow of inward investment into the region, taking the sums committed
back to pre-recession levels. 'The 45 investments from European companies
represented the largest source of inward investment into the region,'
reported the West Midlands Development Agency.
In common with other regions, there has also been over the past year an
increase in mergers, acquisitions and management buy-outs. Demand for
capital to expand still lags behind 1980s levels, however, according to 3i,
the venture capital group.
Over the longer term, the region needs sustained investment, directed not
only at the creation and expansion of companies and the introduction of new
products, but also at the development of a better infrastructure.
Disparate organisations are combining to seek UK and European funding, and
to devise new partnerships between the public and private sectors, to work
on a lengthy list of improvements, such as new roads in the Black Country
and east Birmingham, a light rapid transport system to join Birmingham and
Wolverhampton, and expansion of the airport.
The second essential requirement is to raise the level of education and
skills in the regional workforce. According to government analysis, the West
Midlands has the poorest qualified labour force in Great Britain: in spring
1993 nearly three in 10 workers had no qualification.
Because the lowest levels of attainment are in the cities, and frequently in
the inner areas where there is a high proportion of ethnic minorities, the
social implications are profound. There is already a growing proportion of
people in the inner city areas who, because they lack skills, are
permanently outside the jobs market.
During the next decade, said Mr Bruce Epps, director of strategic management
at Birmingham City Council, 'we have got to get around the fact that a lot
of the jobs in the city are filled by people from outside.'
It is a reminder that the gloss of the city centre, with the bustle of the
International Convention Centre, is a world away from the tower blocks which
look down on it.

Preparations for Apec
Trde ministers and officials from 18 Pacific rim countries meet in Jakarta
this week to prepare for the second summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum. The summit, in Bogor, Indonesia, on November 15, will be
hosted by President Suharto and attended by US President Bill Clinton and
the heads of other Apec states.
The summit will try to agree a declaration calling for 'open regionalism'
and achievement early next century of free trade and investment in Apec,
consistent with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
Africa after Mitterrand: The Franco-African summit in Biarritz,
south-western France, until Wednesday, will ponder whether France's special
relationship will change when Francois Mitterrand's 14-year presidency ends.
Prime minister Edouard Balladur, a possible successor, may warn leaders,
jolted by last year's 50 per cent CFA devaluation, that France's Dollars
1.5bn annual aid is conditional on further reforms.
Slovenia's prime minister Janez Drnovsek arrives in London, hoping for
British support in persuading Italy to stop blocking negotiation of a
European Union association agreement with his country. Italy is trying to
use the issue to win Slovenian concessions on property rights for the heirs
of Italian citizens who lost their homes in territory transferred from Italy
to Yugoslavia after the second world war.
Genetic drugs: The World Health Organisation, meeting in Geneva (to Nov 8),
brings together scientists, doctors and consumer representatives to draw up
safety and ethical guidelines for vaccines and drugs derived from genetic
engineering.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, United Nations secretary-general, chairs a crisis
meeting in Geneva to discuss sending UN troops into the lawless Rwandan
refugee camps in Zaire.
The Solomon Islands parliament is due to elect a new prime minister,
following the resignation of Francis Billy Hilly last week. The Solomons
have been the subject of international environmental concern recently,
because of heavy logging activity, and the election may be critical to the
way in which this issue is tackled.
Top table talk: The Confederation of British Industry's annual conference
gets under way in earnest in Birmingham (to Nov 8). Topics for discussion
include European competitiveness and environmental legislation.
FT Surveys: Birmingham and the West Midlands and China.
Holidays: Bangladesh (National Solidarity Day), Colombia, Russia and Ukraine
(Great October Socialist Revolution), Tunisia.
8 Tuesday
US mid-term elections
Elections take place for 35 of the 100 seats in the Senate, all 435 seats in
the House of Representatives and 36 state governors' seats.
The big question is whether the Republicans can take control of the House or
Senate, or even both, and thus make life even more miserable for President
Bill Clinton (left). The 56 to 44 Democratic Party edge in the Senate looks
most vulnerable, but a 40-seat Republican gain in the House is needed to
overturn the 256-178-1 (an independent) deficit. Of the 36 governorships up
for grabs, 22 are being defended by Democrats.
Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin meets Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine self-rule authority, to discuss Israel's delay in handing over the
occupied West Bank to Palestinian self-rule, and Israeli demands for a
crackdown on the militant Islamic group Hamas.
German-Czech manoeuvres: The two countries begin joint military exercises in
Bohemia, aimed at increased military and security co-operation (to Nov 11).
But they take place against the background of strained relations between
Prague and Bonn, which have got worse following attacks on German tourists
in the Czech Republic.
War crimes tribunal: The international tribunal for war crimes in former
Yugoslavia is due to open in The Hague. In the first such court in Europe
since Nuremburg, Justice Richard Goldstone of South Africa will try
defendants who are seated behind a bullet-proof shield - if there are any.
One difference from its model at the end of the second world war is that the
victor is not running the trials, so there is no authority to enforce
extradition of alleged war criminals.
European Union industry ministers meet in Brussels to discuss a joint
Commission-industry plan to rescue Europe's steel sector by cutting
capacity.
People's MBA: The People's Republic of China's first business school is
founded in Shanghai. The China-Europe International Business School is
backed by the European Union, and a number of European companies including
Airbus Industrie, are sponsoring it. Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for
external relations, will lay the foundation stone. Courses are due to start
in March 1995 and will produce 50 to 100 MBAs a year at first.
FT Surveys: International Fund Management and India.
Holidays: Russia and Ukraine (Great October Socialist Revolution).
9 Wednesday
Finnish vote on EU treaty
Finland's parliament had hoped to have voted in favour of European Union
membership by today, clearing the way for the country to join the union on
January 1 1995. The move, following last month's referendum when Finns voted
in favour of membership by 56.9 per cent to 43.1 per cent, needs to be
approved by a two-thirds majority of the 200-seat legislature. However, it
may be postponed in the wake of delaying tactics by anti-EU MPs.
Sri Lanka holds a presidential election. The current prime minister,
Chandrika Kumaratunge, of the left-
inclined People's Alliance is expected to win easily against Srima
Dissanayake, widow of Gamini Dissanayake, the opposition leader recently
assassinated by Tamil Tiger guerrillas.
Endangered species: Threatened wildlife will be debated at the two-yearly
conference of signatories to the UN Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species, which is meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Among
highly charged topics on the agenda are South Africa's desire to reclassify
elephants and white rhino in a less critical category following growth in
animal numbers. But green groups will be fighting for tighter curbs.
Open channels: Turkey's president Suleyman Demirel opens an irrigation
scheme for the arid Harran plain in the south-east of the country. Two giant
tunnels extending more than 50km (31 miles) take water from the Ataturk dam
on the Euphrates and then distribute it through a 14,000km network of canals
and troughs that will eventually serve 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres).
Saleroom: Monet painted the waterlilies in the garden of his home at Giverny
more than 100 times, but only on four occasions in a circular format. The
only example not in a museum comes up for sale at Christie's main autumn
auction of important Impressionist and modern works of art in New York
tonight. It is from the collection of the New York arts patron, the late
Miss Alice Tully, and is expected to make between Dollars 4m and Dollars 6m.
Fall of the Wall: Today is the fifth anniversary of the opening of the
Berlin Wall. Celebrations and speeches are planned throughout the united
capital of Germany.
FT Survey: Bolivia and Finland.
Holidays: Nepal (Constitution Day), Pakistan, Spain (Madrid only).
10 Thursday
Sum put on Uruguay Round
The Uruguay Round trade accords will make the world some Dollars 500bn a
year richer within a decade, according to a report from the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to be released today.
Euro-Defence: In Brussels, representatives of the nine member states of the
Western European Union are expected to choose a new secretary-general for
the defence organisation, likely to increase its role in European security.
Behind-the-scenes consultations having failed to produce a consensus, there
are three leading candidates: Jose Cutilheiro of Portugal and Giovanni
Jannuzzi of Italy, both career diplomats, and Enrique Baron Crespo, the
Spanish socialist politician.
Germany's newly-elected Bundestag, or lower house, holds its opening session
at the Reichstag in Berlin.
Air waves: Australia and New Zealand's transport ministers are to meet in
Canberra to discuss their open skies policy. Last month, Australia
unilaterally froze a memorandum of understanding giving Air New Zealand the
right to fly internal domestic routes from November 1, causing outrage on
the New Zealand side.
Chess: Garry Kasparov tries to come from behind in the final of the Intel
World Chess Grand Prix in Paris (to Nov 13). Grandmasters from India, Russia
and the Ukraine lead the world No. 1 in the race for the Dollars 50,000
first prize.
11 Friday
Apec trade ministers meet
Apec trade ministers begin a two-day meeting to approve the final text of
the summit declaration.
Antiquities smuggling: A former senior Greek police officer, Michalis
Nistakis, goes on trial charged with antiquities smuggling. Nistakis was
fired in 1993 as chief of police for the Attica region, which includes
Athens, following allegations that he collaborated with a German antiquities
smuggler in exporting illegally excavated artefacts from his native island
of Crete.
Saleroom: Christie's in New York sells one of the most famous manuscripts in
private hands, a group of loose sheets on which Leonardo da Vinci put down
ideas and observations, including many drawings, in the first decade of the
16th century. Formerly known as the Codex Leicester, until the Earl of
Leicester sold it at Christie's in 1980 to the oil billionaire, the late
Armand Hammer, for Pounds 2.42m (Dollars 4m), the Codex Hammer is being sold
by his private museum and is estimated at Dollars 10m.
Ring of bright water: The Queen opens the 50-mile Pounds 250m Thames Water
Ring Main. The pipe will help supply drinking water to more than 3m people
in the London area.
FT Survey: Hungary.
Holidays: Belgium and France (Armistice Day), Poland (National Day), US
(Veterans' Day).
12-13 Weekend
Swedish EU referendum
Sweden holds its referendum on membership of the European Union on Sunday. A
nail-biting finish is in prospect, with polls giving conflicting evidence on
the outcome. A Swedish No would almost certainly doom the pro-EU campaign in
neighbouring Norway, which holds its own referendum on the issue on November
28.
US-China trade: At an Apec side-meeting on Saturday, Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, is due to hold bilateral talks with Wu Yi, China's foreign
trade minister, on Beijing's negotiations to re-join the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
Italian trade unions plan a 1m-strong demonstration in Rome on Saturday to
protest against the government's 1995 budget and pension reform. It follows
a general strike two weeks ago.
The government is struggling to retain the identity and objectives of its
budget despite more than 1,000 amendments tabled by both the members of the
governing right-wing coalition and the opposition.
Rugby: England play Romania at the Twickenham ground in London on Saturday.
Motor racing: The Formula One season ends on Sunday with the Australian
Grand Prix at Adelaide.

Monday: When the Central Statistical Office published its estimate of the
UK's third-quarter gross domestic product, it indicated a slowdown in the
manufacturing sector, with the service sector showing faster growth. Today's
figures are expected to reveal that manufacturing output rose by 0.5 per
cent in September. But after the fall in August, that means third-quarter
growth will only be about 0.5 per cent.
Consumer credit figures for September will also be published today, in both
the UK and the US, with the UK figure expected to drop to Pounds 485m, from
August's record figure of Pounds 632m.
Wednesday: The UK's world trade figures for August are expected to show a
continuation in the recent improvement, with the deficit falling to Pounds
600m, from July's Pounds 704m.
Thursday: The Bundesbank council meets for its routine fortnightly review of
monetary tactics. Interest rate cuts remain on the agenda, just. President
Hans Tietmeyer said on Friday that the bank needed a clearer overview before
it could tell if its rates were still appropriate - and he added a warning
to the effect that they could go up as well as down.

The gilts market will start the week with just a trace of nerves, in case
the chancellor and the governor did, after all, agree to increase base rates
at their monthly monetary meeting last week.
If, as most believe, they decided to leave rates unchanged, there should be
scope for a rally in the short end of the market this week.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, thinks the
longer end of the market will struggle to make progress unless German bunds
perform well. Ten-year gilts yield 120 basis points more than 10-year bunds,
at the lower end of the recent spread range. However, Mr Shepherdson points
out that gilts have been remarkably resilient in the face of weakness in the
US market, suggesting Europe, not the US, is now the dominant influence on
the UK bond market.
Mr Simon Briscoe, bond analyst at SG Warburg Securities, thinks the
ultra-long end of the market may be set to weaken. At the moment, there is
an inverted yield curve at the long end, with long gilt yields being driven
down by the absence of supply.
If, as Mr Briscoe suspects, the chancellor announces a partial gilt repo
facility in the Budget on November 29, that will make it easier for
investors to switch from ultra-longs into medium-term gilts, where yields
are higher.

Trading in cash government bonds is expected to remain subdued this week due
to expectations of higher short-term interest rates. However, the bond
futures market is likely to see a continued increase in activity as dealers
and investors buy back the December contract ahead of an expected
change-over in futures contracts at the end of the week.
A further rise in futures prices could support the cash market. However,
increasing funding needs at banks due to the high level of maturing
certificate of deposits may put upward pressure on short-term interest
rates, which are already gradually rising, and weigh on the bond market.
Some Y10,000bn of three-month CDs are expected to mature as commercial banks
are choosing other methods of capital raising to avoid a rise in three-month
CD rates, which are the basis for short-term prime rates, or lending rates
for first-tier customers. The banks do not want to have to raise short-term
prime rates when demand for funds among corporations is already low.
Most banks have been refraining from issuing CDs since August, resorting to
short-term money markets for funds. At the end of October, outstanding CDs
totalled Y14,980bn, of which 70 per cent are expected to mature this month.

The German bond market is faced by a double uncertainty at home and abroad
which should keep yields high in coming weeks.
The main concern is over the timing and extent of rises in US interest
rates, with anxiety heightened by Friday's lower unemployment figures. 'The
Fed's hesitation in lifting interest rates in a period of dynamic economic
growth stirs inflation fears,' said Mr Jurgen Bokr of BHF Trust.
Once US rates do go up, he added, and the spread between US and German
10-year government bond yields widens a little further, 'the yield on German
long-dated bonds may well fall below the 7 per cent mark again in the first
quarter of 1995'.
Last week, they were around 7.6 per cent. Before they can start drifting
down again, the market will also have to be more relaxed about German fiscal
and thus monetary policy. The re-elected Bonn government's slim majority has
unsettled capital market confidence in its commitment to rein back spending
growth.
The Bundesbank - whose council meets this week, but is expected to leave
interest rates unchanged - also wants to see inflation fall further and M3
growth to ease substantially. 'We need a better overview before we can
decide whether our central bank interest rates remain appropriate,' Mr Hans
Tietmeyer, the bank's president, said on Friday.

FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Brazil maintains issue supply -
Eurobonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Votorantim's three-year eurobond last week came on the heels of
several other Brazilian eurobond offerings and suggests that a recent tax
increase on issuers, while leading to some postponements, has not choked off
supply.
Prospects are expected to improve strongly if the newly elected President,
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is able to consolidate the successes achieved
by his Real plan. Mr Cardoso, whose election was welcomed by the business
community, takes office in January.
Last month, the Brazilian government increased to 7 per cent from 3 per cent
the tax on money raised by eurobond issues in an attempt to limit foreign
exchange inflow. Bankers say the tax may slow down growth but will not
affect the core market.
Mr Edvaldo Morata, a vice-president at Dutch-owned ING Bank's Sao Paulo
office, noted that the Dollars 50m Banco Votorantim issue, which ING Bank
lead-managed, had been postponed for about 10 days while the issuer
recalculated its costs following the tax increase.
'They realised that it was still worth it as they could lend the capital in
Brazil at high local interest rates,' said Mr Morata.
As well as Banco Votorantim there have been issues by Iochpe-Maxion, a car
parts company, Riocell, a pulp company, and Sophora Comercio, a financial
management company, since the tax increase.
Nevertheless, Brazilian issues, like Latin American issues in general, have
been sharply reduced this year because of the turbulence in world interest
rates.
According to West Merchant Bank in London, Brazilian euromarket issues
totalled Dollars 1.8bn in the first three quarters of this year compared
with Dollars 4.5bn for the same period last year.
Bankers believe that economic success for the new government will lead to a
narrowing in the yield spreads paid by Brazilian issuers, as well as an
increase in the demand for capital by local companies. Currently Brazilian
issuers on average pay 400 to 500 basis points above US Treasury bonds. This
compares with up to 250 basis points for Mexican issuers.
Mr Paul Stocking, a vice-president at JP Morgan's emerging market research
in New York, is cautiously optimistic about increased demand for Brazilian
issues butstressed that a further increase in demand for Brazilian paper
depends on economic reforms similar to those already implemented in Mexico
and Argentina.
Until then 'the international market will continue to expect a premium from
Brazilian issuers', he said.
Some analysts believe that, given the size of Brazil's economy and the
competitiveness of its private sector, Brazilian eurobond spreads could come
down by 100 basis points to the Argentine level by 1995, providing reforms
are introduced and inflation controlled.
'The next question is when Brazil will overtake Mexico,' said one Sao Paulo
banker.

FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Australia joins the floating-rate club -
Government issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's decision to issue floating-rate bonds highlights a growing trend
among governments to avoid selling fixed-rate debt at the long end of the
yield curve.
This year's sharp downturn in world bond markets has pushed long-term yields
dramatically higher. As a result, several governments, including the UK,
Germany and Portugal, have become increasingly reluctant to issue long-dated
bonds at what they consider to be unjustifiably high rates, turning instead
to floating-rate debt at much lower money-market rates.
Australia will join the club today with its first-ever issue of
floating-rate domestic government bonds, or Treasury adjustable-rate bonds.
The issue of will consist of ADollars 1.5bn bonds due March 9 1998 with a
coupon of 20 basis points below the three-month bank bill rate and a
re-offer yield 15 basis points below the bank bill rate.
It will be lead-managed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia, with National
Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corporation and Bankers Trust Australia as
co-leads. Future TAB issues are likely to be sold via the usual public
tender system.
According to the Australian Treasury: 'Issuance of this adjustable-rate bond
is expected to enhance the Commonwealth's flexibility to raise debt and
efficiently manage its debt portfolio. Similarly, the introduction of an
adjustable-rate bond will provide investors with greater flexibility in
managing their floating-rate exposure while minimising rollover risk and
assisting interest-rate hedging.'
The shift to floating-rate from fixed-rate debt reflects the Australian
government's reluctance to issue bonds at the long end of the yield curve,
analysts say. On Friday, the 9 per cent government bond due 2004 was
yielding 10.56 per cent, against 6.93 per cent on the three-month bank bill
rate.

FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: GrandMet finds preferred US route -
Corporate issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and drinks group, may have started a trend
by issuing a new kind of undated security in the US fixed-rate preferred
market early last week.
GrandMet issued Dollars 500m of so-called 'preferred securities' on Tuesday,
targeting US institutional and retail investors, with a coupon likely to be
in the range of 9.25 and 9.325 per cent when the paper is priced this week.
The structure of the security, jointly lead-managed by Goldman Sachs and
Merrill Lynch, offers a tax advantage which makes it around 300 basis points
cheaper than a direct issue of preferred shares.
Indeed, the offer is only about 50 to 75 basis points more expensive than
issuing equivalent debt, yet it gives GrandMet's management much greater
flexibility than new borrowing in the debt markets, and the comfort of solid
ratings (A2/A+) from the major US credit rating agencies.
Mr Nick Rose, the company's corporate treasurer, says it provides an
'economic equivalent of a parent issue of preferred stock', will improve
gearing and interest cover, and will lengthen the maturity profile of the
group's debt.
He also stresses that there are wider advantages to be gained from access to
the US fixed-rate preferred market. 'Preferred stock is a retail product
which mamas and papas will buy. This is a way to get GrandMet's name and
brand across to a new class of investors. It can only be beneficial.'
UK companies have been active players in both the variable-rate preferred
stock market (which is priced off the short end of the yield curve) and,
more recently, in the fixed-rate preferred stock market.
However, bankers said the GrandMet deal could be a model for other UK
companies seeking to raise capital in the US.
'The transaction opens up another means of tapping a very significant market
which can have low-cost financing and other strategic benefits.' says Mr
Bruce Macfarlane, a managing director with Merrill Lynch.
The tax advantage of the preferred security is rooted in the creation of a
so-called 'pass-through' subsidiary, located in the US state of Delaware for
tax and legal reasons.
The subsidiary issues the stock and then on-lends the proceeds back to the
parent and to an operating subsidiary (in GrandMet's case based in the US).
Interest payments on the loan are tax deductible. Goldman Sachs, which is
also book-runner for the issue, claims the instrument, which it calls a UK
preferred security, 'represents an attractive and important source of
non-dilutive quasi-equity capital, which to date has been unavailable to UK
corporations.'
Preferred securities offer investors no voting or equity rights and can be
issued in convertible form.
Mr Calum Osborne, executive director, capital markets, at Goldman Sachs,
explains that the new product builds on a range of initiatives in the US
fixed interest preferred market over the last five years.
These were originally triggered by changes in rules governing the
capitalisation of banks, after the report of the Basle committee in 1989.
The ruling of the Basle committee that certain types of perpetual shares
could be counted as tier one capital - as essentially equivalent to equity -
for solvency purposes, prompted a number of British banks to issue preferred
stock. UK companies, including the banks, have issued almost Dollars 4.5bn
worth since 1989.
However, restrictions in local laws made it impractical for most European
banks to issue preferred stock in either the US or in some cases in their
own domestic markets, putting them at a competitive disadvantage.
The solution was to develop so-called 'pass-through' subsidiaries located in
offshore centres such as the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg which could issue
the preferred securities and then on-lend the proceeds to their parent.
European - mainly French and Spanish - companies have issued more than
Dollars 3.58bn in US perpetual preferred stock since September 1991.
The tax advantages - stemming from the conversion treatments of the
inter-company loan - were a by-product of these developments.
Bankers such as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have worked at ways of
bringing these same advantages to a wider range of companies.
One breakthrough came late last year when Goldman developed the idea of
monthly income preferred securities or Mips, allowing domestic US companies
a tax-efficient entry to the preferred market by establishing 'pass-through'
vehicles in the Turks and Caicos Islands, where local corporation law was
amended to accommodate the new structures last year, or more recently in
Delaware.
Since last October, US companies have issued Dollars 5.11bn in Mips, with
utilities companies accounting for 70 per cent of all issues.
The new structure announced last week builds on the Mip idea and gives
GrandMet a better agency rating and greater certainty about tax treatment.
The preferred security is also undated, unlike Mips which have a 30 to
50-year mandatory redemption.
Goldman lays great stress on the favourable response from the rating
agencies.
'Standard &amp; Poor's considers the preferred security as superior to a direct
issue of parent preferred due to low cost, unlimited deferral feature and
limited investor remedies,' says Mr Osborne.
'There has been an accelerated evolution of these structures,' he points
out. 'There is a general recognition that you can achieve lower cost in a
way which is not destructive to agency ratings.'

The Treasury bond market seems likely to remain in a jittery mood this week.
With the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee due to meet eight days
from now, there seems little immediate cause for buyers to come back to the
market - particularly with a wounded dollar and the Treasury's quarterly
refunding this Tuesday and Wednesday.
At least the chance of further price declines this week looks limited. A
belief that the authorities will raise the Federal funds rate sharply,
possibly by more than the 50 basis points, was already largely reflected in
bond prices by last Friday night. The 30-year bond ended the week at a yield
of 8.15 per cent, up from 7.95 per cent a week before and its highest level
for more than three years.
The only significant new data will come on Thursday, with the publication of
the producer price index for October. (With the market closed on Friday for
the Veterans Day holiday, the consumer price index follows next week.) This
is widely expected to show only a modest increase of 0.2 per cent or so, if
any at all, after a 0.5 per cent fall the previous month.
However, last week's jump in the National Association of Purchasing
Management's index suggests that producer price inflation could feed through
into figures later this year.

The market is set for another US-led week, with last Friday's non-farm
payroll and job data providing a key signal for the direction of trade
today, writes Louise Lucas.
Investors will be looking for any inflationary sparks which could feed
through into a further rise in interest rates - initially in the US, but
followed through the currency link into the colony.
Domestically, there is little on the corporate front this week, although
China Light and Power, the electricity utility, reports final results today.
Friday's signing of the long-awaited airport financing deal was received by
investors with a degree of nonchalance, with many analysts believing that
the deal is already fully factored into the market.

Swiss Re's annual press conference tomorrow, and a subsequent presentation
to analysts, may provide further clues on the insurance group's
restructuring plans.
The group decided at the end of September to sell all its interests in
primary insurance companies in order to concentrate on expanding its core
business.
Swiss Re's share price has jumped by almost 30 per cent since the
announcement and, along with other financials, it has also been a
beneficiary of switching out of UBS as the bank's protracted battle for
influence with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision rumbles on.

A spate of corporate results will make for a busy week in Europe's best
performing market over the last quarter, as investors continue to assess
last week's budget in the run-up to Sunday's referendum on EU membership.
Nine-month figures are due today from Trygg-Hansa and SSAB reports tomorrow.
Electrolux produces third quarter details on Wednesday, Pharmacia on
Thursday and Astra and Gambro on Friday.
Mr Peter Tron at Unibank Securities expects a volatile week, although he
said that the week's corporate results were unlikely to disappoint.
However, opinion polls suggest that the EU referendum may be too close to
call, although Mr Tron said that the markets were discounting a 'yes' vote.
A 'no' vote, he said, could in the short-term lead to a 10 - 15 per cent
correction in equities and a rise in the long bond yield from the current
11.4 per cent to around 13 per cent.

After a good set of company results last week, attention now turns to the
two Anglo-Dutch heavyweights, Royal Dutch and Unilever, quoted both in
London and Amsterdam, writes John Pitt.
Hoare Govett said it was broadly neutral toward energy stocks, and was
targeting an oil price of Dollars 16.70 a barrel for Brent by the end of
this year, rising to Dollars 17.30 by the end of 1995.
While Royal Dutch would benefit from its announced redundancy plans in
Europe, as well as the recovery in the chemicals sector overall, the broker
said that while the stock looked reasonable value against the market, it did
not expect it to outperform a rising market.
Hoare was more positive on Unilever, and recommended taking a buy position
since the current low valuation was primarily the result of 'negative
sentiment with no material impact on fundamental results'.

The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but James Capel says the sharp rebound in
manufacturing orders in September suggests that it is unlikely to be
persuaded to ease its monetary stance, in spite of some disappointment over
industrial output figures.
The broker adds that the strength of other European economies points to a
strong fourth quarter in Germany while the already high level of capacity
utilisation heralds an inflationary threat, probably in 1996.
On the corporate front, Munich Re's balance sheet press conference tomorrow
is likely to reveal more about the 1993-94 figures, and Siemens will release
preliminary figures for the year to September 30 on Wednesday.
The company has already said operating profits are expected to decline by 10
 -15 per cent over the year. In the first nine months, group net profit fell
to DM1.25bn from last year's DM1.32bn for the same period, while last time's
full-year group net profit was DM1.98bn.
UBS is awaiting Veba's nine-month figures on Thursday. It expects another
increase in pre-tax profits, of about 50 per cent to DM420m, which is at the
upper end of expectations and should be viewed positively.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: CBI warning revives fears of tightening -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index scale is beginning to replace the
Berlin Wall in the minds of UK investors. Some large and highly profitable
deals are being done in equities, the sale of Elf-Aquitaine's stake in
Enterprise Oil providing but one example. But across the broad range of the
market, institutional interest remains light and stockbroking firms not on
the right networks are finding it hard to make profits in a market which has
made virtually no consistent progress since the end of July, and has now
returned to its levels of 12 months ago.
Strategists at the leading UK securities firms offer little comfort for a
break-out in the Footsie range this week. 'Only a tightening of monetary
policy (in the US) can have any sustained impact upon the dollar and US
Treasuries,' comments NatWest Securities in reviewing the Federal Reserve's
activities in currencies.
Assuming that this will not happen until after Tuesday's US mid-term
elections, the market will continue to worry ahead of the meeting of the
Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting on November 15.
On the domestic side, NatWest is equally forthright as well as in the
mainstream of City belief in emphasising that the Bank of England's
inflation report leaves unchanged its forecast that 'base rates will rise
another 0.5 per cent early next year'; but it adds that 'it is a close call
between then and this week'.
The sudden appearance of danger this week is pinned on the Confederation of
British Industries warning that industry needs to pass on its higher raw
material costs to customers.
A rate rise in December, so soon after the budget, is ruled out but NatWest
thinks the Bank of England might just elect to raise rates now and ignore
the uproar from a market just informed that the Bank feels happier about
inflation.
The stock market felt mildly affronted last week when the news agencies
reported the Bank's inflation views immediately while its reminder on base
rate trends led the following morning's newspapers.
Sluggish market conditions are beginning to take toll of the the new issues
among smaller capitalised stocks, those with flotation capitalisations of
Pounds 250m or less.
BZW warns that, with more than 55 per cent of its sample of this year's
small-cap new issues now trading at or below their flotation price, the
institutions are likely to set themselves significantly higher 'quality
control' standards in the final quarter of the year. This could imply more
attractive new issue possibilities ahead, especially if some of the deals
recently pulled make a reappearance. The scale of under-performance by 1994
small-cap new issues can hardly be repeated.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan
Regent Pacific, the Hong Kong based Asian fund management and financial
services group, has formed a joint venture with the National Investment
Trust of Pakistan and Dar-al Maal Al-Islami Group of Saudi Arabia for an
asset management and financial services company in Karachi.
The Emerging Investment Company, with a paid up capital of Rp100m (Dollars
3.3m), plans to float both closed-end and open-end investment vehicles in
Pakistan, and hopes to launch the first closed-end fund by the end of the
year.
South Africa
The International Finance Corporation launched new stock indices for South
Africa from November 1, thereby increasing its coverage of emerging markets
to 26. The new indices - global and investable - are weighted by market
capitalisation.
South Africa, with a per capita GNP of Dollars 2,670 at the end of 1992
qualifies as an emerging market under World Bank definitions, and as such is
the world's largest with a total market cap of Dollars 218bn.
China
The People's Bank of China is understood to be considering opening 10 more
major cities, including Beijing, to foreign financial institutions. The
insurance market in Shanghai would also be opened up to foreign companies on
an experimental basis.
India
The finance ministry has announced new rules for takeovers saying buyers
must disclose intentions ahead of acquiring large blocks of shares in target
companies.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Institutional buyers drive trend towards
global deals - International issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that the number of overseas listings on the London Stock Exchange so
far this year doubled during October is further evidence of the
internationalisation of the equity capital market.
Although the numbers are small, with the five newcomers to London listings
raising Pounds 146m in October, one of them was Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications giant which, with a total
capitalisation of Dollars 138bn, is the biggest company in the world.
The desire by companies in emerging markets to access international capital
was shown by the growth of Indian groups listing in London, since the
regulations for the listing of global depositary receipts were changed in
August.
New Indian GDRs now listed in London include: East India Hotels; Shriram
Industries, the food oils group; JK Corp, the copier/airmail group; and
Bajaj Autos, the scooter and motorcycle group.
Overall companies - mainly from the emerging markets - have raised more than
Dollars 11bn since the birth of the GDR in 1990, with Dollars 5.5bn of that
raised so far in 1994.
While lagging far behind the world's bond markets, equity markets are
rapidly becoming more international.
A further small example of this is the vendor placing on Friday by Forte,
the UK hotel group, to pay for Meridien, the French hotel group. Forte won
control of Meridien earlier this year, defeating Accor of France, and used
Forte shares to pay for the acquisition.
Since Forte wanted to broaden its global shareholder base, it turned to UBS
and Paribas, the European bank, to place the shares internationally.
'It is attractive to have our equity in the same place as our assets,' said
Mr Richard Power of Forte.
Two other equity issues being prepared for launch also highlight the
tendency towards the globalisation of equity. BSkyB, the satellite
television broadcaster, and TeleWest, the UK cable television and telephony
operator that has two US parents, are both thought to be planning roadshows
in the UK and US and listings in London and New York.
A report published last Friday by the McKinsey Global Institute, the
consultants, addresses the same issue. It says: 'The equity markets have
been slower to globalise than the foreign exchange or bond markets.
Significant differences in valuation still exist across different national
equity markets even for comparable companies in identical industries.'
While the daily volume of global foreign exchange markets is about Dollars
1,000bn a day and that of government bond markets Dollars 200bn a day, the
total daily volume of all the world's stock exchanges is only Dollars 23bn a
day, the report says.
However, globalisation of equity markets is now being driven by
institutional investors, who are rapidly increasing their mix of
international equities in their portfolios.
This globalisation is also helped by liberalisation of regulations, advances
in technology, securitisation and the use of derivatives, says the report.
Growth in the global capital market will also mean more integration. The
report says financial assets are 'beginning to act as if they were part of a
single, integrated market that links together the foreign exchange markets,
money markets, bond markets and equity markets'.
But for the bankers at UBS and Paribas, who shifted Pounds 175m of shares
within four hours on Friday, the global market is already here.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Peru steps out to woo the investors - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong economic recovery after years of recession underpins the stock market
boom that is making Lima the new darling among Latin American emerging
markets.
Selected Peruvian stocks - particularly in the mining, banking and cement
sectors - have featured consistently among Baring Securities' list of best
performers worldwide over the past couple of months.
Peru is also making its debut in the international capital market place. Six
weeks ago, Banco Wiese became the first Peruvian company to raise capital
through a level 3 ADR issue on the New York stock exchange. The offering was
heavily oversubscribed and institutional investors who bought in saw
immediate gains of nearly 20 per cent.
Equally significant is that Peruval, the stockbroker, has just succeeded in
raising more than Dollars 50m of venture capital for its newly-constituted
company, Peru Real Estate.
'This is Peru's first venture capital deal,' says Mr Lorenzo Sousa, joint
managing director of Peruval. 'Five Peruvians went to New York and raised
Dollars 22m in 48 hours, with PaineWebber underwriting more than Dollars
50m. We've raised real money on nothing but a project. That's
unprecedented.'
Peruval's backers are institutional investors in the US and Europe,
including George Soros' Quantum Fund, Lehman Brothers and Martin Curry of
Edinburgh. The project offers them a 37 per cent internal rate of return
over the medium term - 'more than realistic in today's Peru,' says Mr Sousa.
Three main factors have helped spur recent investor enthusiasm for Lima.
Firstly, the realisation that spectacular economic growth is solidly based;
secondly, highly encouraging third-quarter results from some leading
companies; and finally President Fujimori's late October visit to New York,
where he completed a busy programme of promotional contacts with investors
and the business community.
Lima's general share index registered a rise of 8.7 per cent last month,
while the selective index of 15 blue chips put on 8.5 per cent.
By the end of October, market capitalisation had jumped to Dollars 8.3bn,
putting on 3 per cent in the month and 64 per cent since the start of the
year. Volumes traded in both September and October were about Dollars 370m,
some 60 per cent higher than August. The daily average traded over the past
12 months has been Dollars 13.5m, with foreign investors accounting for
maybe 45 per cent of the total.
Recent activity, it is true, comes after a sluggish period from April to
July. The index put on some 40 per cent in the first quarter of the year, on
domestic economic growth prospects and increased direct foreign investment.
The Dollars 2bn purchase by Telefonica, the Spanish group, of a controlling
share in formerly state-owned telecommunications companies Entel and CPT
gave the market a special boost.
Like all other Latin American stock markets, however, Lima responded
negatively to the successive rises in US interest rates and, in lesser
measure, to the assassination in March of Mr Donaldo Colosio, the Mexican
presidential candidate. More than a quarter was knocked off values in the
April to August period.
'Lima isn't immune to the generalised rise and fall of world markets,' says
Mr Jose Miguel Gamarra, head of research at Baring's Lima office. 'But the
real difference here is Peru's excellent economic performance which is not
found in other emerging markets.'
Peruvian GDP has grown by 12.3 per cent in the first nine months of the year
with the fishing and construction sectors each topping 30 per cent growth.
Last year, output rose by 6.5 per cent.
Inflation, meanwhile, seems to have been tamed. October price rises in Peru
 -at less than 0.3 per cent - were lower than in most of the developed
world. Inflation looks likely to end the year below 18 per cent.
On the back of these achievements, large companies are turning in sharply
improved performances. Mr Miguel Palomino, director of Peru's
recently-opened Lima office of Smith New Court, says the 24 leading Peruvian
companies he monitors closely are expected to announce 1994 profits on
average double last year's.
The turnround in companies' performance answers the question of whether,
with current p/e's of about 25, Peruvian stocks are overvalued. 'If you are
looking backwards, maybe yes, but projecting ahead to 1995, definitely no,'
says Mr Palomino. He predicts an average p/e of about 15 for the coming year
for market leaders.
Since current strong growth follows years of recession (GDP dropped 25 per
cent between 1988 and 1992), Peruvian companies find themselves with
installed capacity to spare - at present, only about 60 per cent is
utilised, allowing for rapid expansion on minimal investment.
With Peru investing heavily in upgrading infrastructure and consumer demand
picking up, local analysts are still tipping the basics as best local bets
for growth.
Mining companies Buenaventura (silver and gold), Minsur (tin), SPCC (copper)
and Milpo (lead and zinc) are highly recommended, for their management as
well as their prospects. Cementos Lima, newly transferred to the private
sector and Cementos Norte Pacasmayo, which is soon to be privatised; brewers
Backus and Johnston and CNC; and CPT and Tele 2000, the telecommunications
companies, are the stocks on every broker's list of recommendations.
Peru's financial sector, too, 'is going to grow like crazy,' says Mr
Palomino. The Banco de Credito, Peru's largest bank with some 29 per cent of
all deposits, showed profits of Dollars 30m in the first nine months, while
Banco Wiese, the second private bank, notched up profits of Dollars 21m.
Following the success of Banco Wiese's ADR issue there should be several
more Peruvian issues in coming months. The Delgado Parker telecommunications
group will launch Pantel, and Cementos Lima will follow its June
international over-the-counter offering by registering a number of its
shares under the ADR mechanism.
Prospects for further stock market expansion are good. The Fujimori
administration's aggressive privatisation programme is in full swing and a
residue of state-held shares (the state is initially retaining about 30 per
cent in privatised telecommunications and energy sector companies) will
gradually be released on to the local market.
According to Peruval, these initial public offerings could boost Lima's
market capitalisation from its present Dollars 8bn to about Dollars 14bn by
late next year and Dollars 19bn by 1996.
With general elections coming up in less than six months, the stock market
might be expected to go through a bumpy patch. No serious challenger to Mr
Fujimori, however, shows any desire to deviate from the firm economic lines
set by the current administration and analysts expect sustained annual
growth of at least 5 per cent for the next three or four years.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar will remain the centre of attention, even if intervention by the
Federal Reserve last week effectively put a short-term floor under the
currency.
The focus of market attention will now shift to the November 15 meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee, which is widely expected to sanction a
further rise in US interest rates.
In the interim, the dollar is likely to be protected from the full force of
market bearishness by the prospect of further intervention, possibly on a
co-ordinated basis.
The dollar is sure to be a subject of discussion when G10 central bankers
meet today in Basle. So far, however, there has been no indication of
intervention spreading beyond the US and Japan.
Dollar selling pressure among institutional investors also appears limited.
'They are very aware that the crowd psychology in the market is moving
towards a position of extreme bearishness,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist at Citibank in London.
'They are not really in the mood to sell the currency from these sorts of
levels.'
With mid-term congressional elections this week, and the quarterly treasury
refunding, the US authorities have ample reason for wanting to stabilise the
dollar.
Mr Robin Aspinall, strategist at Panmure Gordon, the broker, comments: 'A
stable dollar may win more votes; it certainly makes it easier to sell bonds
to foreigners.'
The elections are unlikely to have much market impact, except in the
unlikely event of the Democrats doing much better than expected, or the
Republicans making gains on traditional Democratic strongholds.
One event that will distract attention from the US is the Bundesbank council
meeting on Thursday. As Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has
stressed recently, German rates can go in either direction.
This is more than can be said for many of the other leading economies, where
the direction of rates can only be up.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Rise in rates now seen as almost certain -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
November is shaping up to be a cruel month for the US stock market, if the
first few days are anything to go by. Last week, the Dow ran up a loss of
123 points, or more than 3 per cent. The fall was prompted primarily by a
jump in bond yields to 8.16 per cent, their highest levels since August,
1991, and by renewed concerns about inflation.
This week, those two themes - rising bond yields and fears of inflation -
are likely to continue to haunt the stock market which, with the
third-quarter reporting season now over, no longer has the crutch of
encouraging corporate earnings to rely upon.
All investors have to look forward to over the coming weeks are higher
interest rates. Short-term rates are almost certainly going to go up within
the next week and a half because the Federal Reserve appears poised to
tighten monetary policy for the sixth time this year.
There is near-unanimity among analysts that the move will come on November
15, when the Fed's policy-making open market committee next meets. Recent
data have done nothing to dispel the notion that the economy is growing at
such a rate that the central bank must tighten the screws soon to ensure
inflation does not get out of hand in 1995.
The only disagreement among Wall Street's sages is over how big the rate
increase will be; 50 basis points (which would take the target on the Fed
funds rate up to 5 1/4 per cent) or 100 basis points. A 50bp rise is already
priced into both stocks and bonds. If the Fed were to raise rates by a full
percentage point, then the markets would probably suffer a nasty, if short,
sell-off.
As for long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield on the 30-year
bond), they continue to test the record highs of recent years. Money
continues to flow into stocks, but at some stage the steady climb in bond
yields could cause investors to reverse those flows.
Recent figures show that money market funds have been attracting a
considerable amount of cash as investors move funds out of an increasingly
sickly-looking stock market. It may not be long before longer-term bond
funds enjoy a similar renaissance.
That moment could come soon. Analysts at NatWest Securities point out that
when bonds have yielded three times more than stocks, the equity market has
run aground. With bonds yielding 8.2 per cent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
about 2.8 per cent, this particular alarm bell could sound at any moment.
The only good news this week is that there will be no trading in government
bonds on Friday because US banks will be shut for the Veteran's Day holiday,
which means the stock market will be able to stop worrying about rising bond
yields, if only for a single day.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: LME studies US warehousing - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange on Wednesday holds its first management board
meeting since its move a week ago to new, bigger premises in Fenchurch
Street. Members will be paying particular attention to see if there is any
development on plans to extend the exchange's warehouse coverage to the US.
This issue has been brought to the fore in recent weeks by a tightening
squeeze on copper supplies that has distorted the price structure of that
metal's contract at the LME.
Exchange warehouse stocks of copper have fallen to the equivalent of five
and a half weeks' consumption - an uncomfortably low level, according to
some analysts. But some suggest that that is not the whole reason for the
growing 'backwardation' (price premium for nearby delivery over forward
positions) in the market. An additional problem, they say, is that most of
the LME stockpile is in Europe, while most of the short-term demand is in
the US.
In normal circumstances forward positions in the metals markets are at a
premium to nearbys (as they are at the moment for all other LME contracts),
reflecting the costs of holding physical metal - lost interest, storage,
insurance etc. But tight availability of supplies for nearby delivery can
reverse this position; and inadequate warehouse coverage can make matters
worse.
It has also been suggested that Wednesday's board meeting could discuss
extending warehousing in south-east Asia outside Singapore. Metal Bulletin
magazine said this week that there had been talk emanating from China that
Shanghai could be a candidate.
On Thursday the International Primary Aluminium Institute is to issue its
assessment of western world stocks of the metal in September. LME traders
will be anxious to see evidence of a continuation of the drawdown, following
the multilateral production-cutting agreement reached earlier this year,
that has helped to lift prices to four-year highs.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: Prodding the commodity bubble - Global Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For most of this year, commodities have looked like a one-way bet. Aluminium
and copper, the two most heavily-traded metals, have jumped by 70 per cent
in the past 12 months, and cocoa, coffee and orange juice, like many soft
commodities, have also shown sharp gains.
For all those investors who get vertigo at the size of the rises there have
been others to argue that, judging by commodities' behaviour in previous
economic recoveries, further large gains are still on the cards.
On the back of this enthusiasm, investment and broking houses have rushed in
the past few months to put together commodities indices, as well as
specialised funds to make access to the markets easier.
That marks a sea change from the 1980s, when most investment houses took a
distinctly haughty stance towards non-income yielding investments, and
towards the commodity markets in particular. Familiarity with a wider range
of zero-coupon instruments and zero-dividend shares has bred tolerance.
However, as commodities prices have continued to rise in the past few weeks,
some who were previously bullish have begun asking whether speculative
activity is now driving the prices above levels justifiable on analysis of
demand and supply alone. It is the right point at which to ask that
question; although evidence of specu-lative participation is at the moment
anecdotal, it does suggest that such trades are an increasingly important
element.
The bullish case is still vigorously espoused, nonetheless. Goldman Sachs,
the broker, and one of the loudest advocates of commodities' attractions,
has been urging large private pension funds to keep 5 per cent of their
global portfolios in commodities, a high level by traditional standards.
Goldman bases its argument on a projection of steadily rising worldwide
demand as European and Japanese economies gather steam. It has on its side
indications such as the shortages of aluminium already reported by
industrialised countries. It could also point out that demand for copper and
nickel rose by 7 per cent in the first half of 1994 compared with the
corresponding period in 1993.
The more specialised the material's use, the more dramatic the effect of
such increases in demand; the price of palladium has doubled in the past
year simply because of booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones and
personal computers.
The current proponents of commodities also argue that not much capacity has
been added in recent years in commodity-producing industries. They argue
instead that the fall in eastern European production has contracted supply.
It is unclear yet how many houses are following the bulls' advice. However,
analysts are starting to say, with more conviction than a few months ago,
that the price of commodities, both metals and soft, has risen higher than
can be explained by levels of demand and supply.
For a start, market traders and analysts estimate that banks and investment
funds have put Dollars 16bn into metals so far this year. They also reckon
that banks control some 75 per cent of the London Metal Exchange stocks.
There are also signs that investors are losing their discrimination between
commodities. The zinc price, for instance, has followed that of the other
metals upwards despite European overcapacity.
One weakness of the bulls' argument is that it does not recognise the
rapidity with which patterns of supply and demand can change in response to
the price rises.
Although it is true that supplies of metals have not increased greatly in
the past few years, they could now do so, enticed by higher prices, locked
in by manufacturers through the futures markets. Meanwhile, traders
acknowledge that the price rises could cause a permanent drop in demand, if
substitutes are found for raw materials, or if investment to raise
efficiency is stepped up.
But the central weakness is that investors' use of commodities as an escape
route from bond and equity markets troubled by inflationary fears is
misguided. From one perspective, this is a sound bet, as commodity price
rises may eventually feed through into retail prices.
If this does happen, and inflationary pressures do emerge again, commodities
could fare well initially. But if interest rates rose in response, investors
would be likely to desert commodities in favour of interest-bearing
investments.
On the other hand if manufacturers fail to pass on the increases in raw
material costs to consumers, commodity producers will eventually find
themselves restrained in their ability to charge more.
In recent sets of UK data, the sharpest price increases in manufacturing
output were reported in sectors with greatest exposure to world commodity
prices, such as pulp and paper, metals, rubbers and chemicals. However there
are also signs that manufacturers have had to absorb much of the increases
in raw material prices without passing them on, and that margins are being
squeezed.
In the past year, investors' enthusiasm for commodities has looked like a
rare example of perfect timing. But increasingly, one of the main props for
commodities prices is simply inflationary fears, fuelled partly by the
rising cost of commodities themselves. That is a fragile argument on which
to be resting even a small slice of a portfolio.
There are enough powerful advocates of commodities' attractions at the
moment, and demand for raw materials is growing fast enough to give
investors an opportunity to begin to unwind positions which they have built
up this year. It is a chance they should consider taking.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Markets: China as next superpower? - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is China the next economic superpower and, if so, how soon will it achieve
that status? Those who say it is, or very soon will be, point to
calculations of the kind shown in the chart.
Among them is William Overholt in an important recent book.* Citing an
estimate of Dollars 2,500 per head for Chinese real income put forward by
Larry Summers, when chief economist of the World Bank, he argues that 'if
Summers' calculation is correct, China's economy will pass the US economy in
sheer size within 11 years'.
Yet even if that were true, China would not have the most powerful economy
in the world. To see this, it is necessary to understand what such estimates
actually mean.
Consider India, for which more reliable calculations exist than for China.
At market exchange rates, its GNP per head was Dollars 310 in 1992, this
being only 1.3 per cent of the US level. But the average Indian did not
survive on a real income 98.7 per cent smaller, since so much of what
Indians consume is far cheaper. At common international prices (or
purchasing power parity - PPP), Indian income per head was Dollars 1,210, 5
per cent of the US level.
There are three main reasons why internal relative prices differ across
countries: protection at the border; internal taxation and subsidisation;
and differences in costs of labour (and land). In the case of comparisons
between developing and more advanced countries, the last is much the most
important.
Market exchange rates equate only the prices of tradeable goods and services
across frontiers (net of protection). Generally, however, services are both
less tradeable and more labour-intensive than goods. A resident of Los
Angeles could save a small fortune by buying haircuts in Madras. She cannot
do so, however, because transport costs are too high. Accordingly, GNP per
head of poor countries at PPP is far higher than it is at market prices.
The Bank's estimate of China's national income per head in 1992, at market
exchange rates, is Dollars 470, while its guess-estimate of the country's
GNP per head at PPP is Dollars 1,910, the relationship between the two being
roughly the same as for India. (For a more detailed analysis of Chinese
wealth and economic performance, see the article on page 4 of this morning's
China survey.)
Because primary data have not been collected in China, the PPP number is
derived from a cross-country statistical relationship linking GNPs at market
exchange rates to those at PPP. Other estimates of China's GNP per head at
PPP in the early 1990s vary between Dollars 1,000 (which would make the
economy a little larger than that of France) and Dollars 3,000 (which would
make it even larger than Japan's).
The uncertainty is huge. But concentrate on the Bank estimates. China's 1992
GNP at market exchange rates was only Dollars 506bn, smaller than Spain's
and eighth largest in the world, while its GNP at PPP is estimated at
Dollars 2,220bn. What has changed? The answer is that China has tens of
millions of tax inspectors, teachers, builders, hairdressers, policemen,
judges, doctors and so forth, all of whom are paid a pittance. Adjust their
wages to international prices and the size of China's economy explodes.
The economy does not just become far bigger at international prices, its
structure changes. On the plausible assumption that spending on manufactures
at market prices is roughly the same as at international prices,
manufacturing would be only 10 per cent of China's GNP at PPP, down from 40
per cent at market prices. It is obvious, however, that China is not made
more powerful by having millions and millions of cheap teachers,
hairdressers and so forth. This merely means the country is poor and
populous.
Because the weight of services is much larger in GNP at PPP, growth rates
will also be lower. The reason is that manufacturing has been the fastest
growing sector of the Chinese economy. If it is given a smaller weight, the
growth of the economy will also be reduced.
Yet there is one respect in which the PPP numbers do say something about
economic size. Convergence of GNP per head between China and more advanced
economies will be faster than projections of recent real rates of growth
from GNP at market prices would suggest. The reason is that real wages will
rise as the economy grows. Those increases in real wages will show up as an
appreciation of the real exchange rate. The explanation is that productivity
growth in tradeable goods will be faster than in services. At an exchange
rate that keeps international prices of tradeable goods roughly in line,
those of non-tradeable services will rise. The effect will be particularly
large in the case of China, because its economy is likely to grow
particularly quickly.
Nevertheless, purchasing power adjustments of GNP are relevant for estimates
of economic welfare, but not of a country's international economic
influence. That depends on the scale of its participation in trade and
capital flows, its technological sophistication and the size and diversity
of its manufacturing, on all of which the PPP adjustment is at the least
misleading. The question is when China might become more powerful than the
US in such respects. This is a vital matter for the future of the world, to
be addressed two weeks from today.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Santander regains stake in Ebro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The fall of Barcelona financier Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former chief
Spanish executive of the Kuwait Investment Office, who is being held pending
investigations into his business dealings, has prompted the return of Banco
Santander as a major shareholder of Ebro, the leading domestic sugar and
rice producer.
The development raises questions about the continuation of Grupo Torras, the
KIO's investment arm in Spain, as Ebro's biggest shareholder and could
prompt a major equity restructuring of Spain's unsettled sugar sector,
paving the way for new investment, both domestic and foreign, in the
industry.
Santander recovered 9.9 per cent of Ebro through the execution of the stake
held in the company by Mr de la Rosa. The banking group had sold the equity
to Mr de la Rosa in 1992 and the shareholding had been offered by the
financier as collateral for the loan he had received from Santander for the
acquisition.
Santander is now the second-largest shareholder of Ebro after the 36.5 stake
held in the company by Torras, a purchase that was masterminded by Mr de la
Rosa before Torras began losing heavily two years ago and the KIO severed
its relationship with the financier.
The return of the shareholding to Santander eases the instability at the
company which followed the fall-out between Torras and Mr de la Rosa, and
could prompt the removal of its chairman Mr Manuel Guasch, who was brought
into the company by Mr de la Rosa.
The banking group, which has a policy of disinvesting from industrial
assets, is likely to sell its Ebro stake as soon as it judges the price to
be right and the unresolved question is whether the KIO will use this
development to dispose of its equity.
'Torras has to take a drastic decision: whether it finally pulls out of Ebro
or whether it stays as a stable shareholder and contributes to the growth of
the company,' said Mr Juan Bastos, of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities.
Last year, Torras indicated its willingness to sell its stake in the food
group, which controls 54 per cent of Spain's sugar quota, but the continued
presence of Mr de la Rosa as a major Ebro shareholder kept prospective
buyers away. At the time Torras was understood to have sounded out Tate &amp;
Lyle, Germany's Sudzucker and Ferruzzi of Italy.
The potential disposals at Ebro come in the wake of an attempt by Banco
Central Hispano (BCH), to sell its controlling stake in General Azucacera,
the second-ranked domestic sugar producer, to Saint-Louis of France and the
UK's Tate &amp; Lyle. Last week BCH was forced to drop the sale following strong
objections from the Spanish agriculture ministry.
The ministry said it opposed BCH's planned sale to protect Spain's sugar
quota in the European Union and stressed that any change in Azucacera's
equity should be part of a wider restructuring of the big domestic sugar
groups.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: ABN Amro expected to buy ailing
Polish bank

ABN Amro, the Dutch bank is expected to purchase the Interbank, an ailing
Polish private bank, by the end of this month, according to officials at the
National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank.
The successful bid for Interbank, which reported a loss last year and is
currently controlled by the NBP, comes against competition from Deutsche
Bank, which also wants to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland.
Both banks have chosen the takeover route for entry into Poland under
pressure from the NBP, which has said it will not issue licences to new
banks but wants investors to buy into existing banks which would thus
consolidate the sector. Chase Manhattan, another unsuccessful applicant, has
recently been reminded by Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, head of the NBP, that
this policy remains in place.
Interbank has two branches and losses worth 104bn zlotys (Dollars 4.5m) at
the middle of this year, while its capital is valued at 167.6bn zlotys.
ABN Amro is reportedly offering to pay 40 per cent over the nominal
Interbank share price of 640,000 zlotys to existing shareholders and to
invest Dollars 40m in the bank.
The Dutch bank is currently a partner in the International Bank in Poland, a
joint venture with two local banks, Credit Lyonnais and Banco Commerciale
Italiana.
The NBP recently issued a joint banking licence to Dresdner Bank and BNP in
recognition of the former's role in negotiating Poland's recent 49 per cent
commercial bank debt reduction deal. Commerzbank of Germany has also just
been given a permit to purchase up to 21 per cent of the stock in the Export
Development Bank.
The handful of foreign banks currently present in Poland, including
Citibank, Creditanstalt, ING and Raiffeisen, were granted licences before
1992, when policy was tightened.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ambroveneto claims bid by BCI is
doomed to fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, the Italian bank, claimed at the weekend that the
takeover planned by Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) and announced only last
week was already doomed to fail.
Mr Giovanni Bazoli, Ambroveneto's chairman, confirmed on Saturday that the
bank's largest shareholders had agreed to renew and reinforce their
defensive pact, which controls a majority of the bank's shares.
BCI wants to buy a 50.1 per cent stake in Ambroveneto for about L1,750bn
(Dollars 1.1bn), as the rationalisation of the highly fragmented Italian
banking sector gathers pace.
Another big Italian bank, Credito Italiano (Credit), is preparing to bid
more than L2,000bn for a majority stake in the Bologna-based Credito
Romagnolo (Rolo). Neither bank has yet tabled a formal offer.
Mr Bazoli said at the weekend that Ambroveneto would strengthen its links
with its two largest shareholders, Credit Agricole of France, and Crediop,
part of San Paolo di Torino, Italy's largest banking group, each of which
owns just over 15 per cent of the bank.
Under the terms of the shareholder pact, they will buy most of the 13.52 per
cent stake offered to them by a group of small banks from the Veneto region.
Another shareholder - Gruppo Banca San Paolo di Brescia  - has agreed to
maintain its 12.7 per cent stake as part of the pact.
BCI has so far declined to comment on the latest developments, let alone
admitted defeat. Ambroveneto's shareholders have also remained silent, but
Mr Bazoli believes the bank is now impregnable.
'Integration (with BCI) would have destroyed half the value built up over 12
years of rebuilding Ambroveneto,' he said on Saturday.
Alleanza, the Italian insurer which owns 12 per cent of Ambroveneto, has
still not decided whether to renew its commitment to the shareholder pact.
Alleanza is part of Generali, Italy's biggest insurer. It is seen as an ally
of BCI because all three companies are linked to Mediobanca, the influential
Milan-based merchant bank.
Meanwhile, Credit has taken on JP Morgan, the US investment bank, and Vitale
Borghese, an Italian merchant bank, to advise on its bid for Rolo.
The Bologna bank, which is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
of the US, has resisted the Credit approach and is planning a defensive
merger with its local rival, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna.

Singapore Press Holdings, the island republic's largest publishing group,
has announced pre-tax profits for the year ending August 31 1994 of SDollars
403m (USDollars 269m), a 31 per cent rise on the previous year's figure.
Group turnover was up 16 per cent to SDollars 767.5m, mainly due to a 17 per
cent rise in advertising revenue and a 7 per cent increase in circulation
revenue.
Group investment income increased by SDollars 17m to SDollars 56m due to
higher interest income and a SDollars 23m profit from the sale of
securities.
Among extraordinary items, SPH says it made a SDollars 13m profit from the
sale of its stake in Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper.
SPH publishes most of the leading titles in Singapore, including The Straits
Times, the Business Times, and the Sunday Times, leading Chinese and Malay
newspapers, and a variety of popular magazines.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bonn to limit Telekom fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and MICHAEL LINDEMANN

   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government intends to hold down the costs of the planned DM15bn
(Dollars 10bn) privatisation of Deutsche Telekom by keeping a tight rein on
the fees of banks handling the issue.
Officials involved in the planning for the issue, expected early in 1996,
said total fees to banks should be under 3 per cent; this would comprise
selling, management and underwriting charges. They said the international
trend was to a lower level of fees now the task of assessing investor
interest was being made smoother by the book-building process.
In the recent Lufthansa privatisation, which raised some DM1bn, fees were
just above 3 per cent. This would mean a fee total of DM450m or so for the
Telekom issue - in which 25 per cent of the shares will probably be sold off
in the first tranche - compared with the DM400m or less the government is
considering.
The choice of banks to head the issue has still to be made. Deutsche Bank
and Dresdner Bank are expected to share overall management. Deutsche is
likely to handle the international side - it said a week ago it was basing
its investment banking activities in London - and Dresdner domestic sales.
Several UK, US and Swiss banks are vying for the role of global
co-ordinator; one will also advise the government.
The officials said the government was keen that the Telekom issue should
help promote the concept of share ownership among the German public and also
encourage companies to offer more employee shares. Not enough companies and
employee representatives took advantage of tax concessions intended to
encourage employee share ownership.
Nor is Germany as equity-conscious as some other countries like the US or
UK, they noted. Only 6 per cent of German households own shares and their
private financial assets of some DM4,000bn include only 5 per cent in
equities and more than 40 per cent in bank deposits.
The government does not want Telekom shares priced especially low just to
encourage small investors but it would like banks to reduce or waive (for,
say, two years) handling fees for shares deposited with them by private
investors.

Strong growth from its Australian white goods division helped Fisher and
Paykel boost after-tax profits by 82 per cent to NZDollars 19.4m (USDollars
12m) in the six months to September 30. Sales rose by 20.8 per cent to
NZDollars 381m.
Sir Colin Maiden, the chairman, said that the increase was largely due to
improved profit margins. Margins also improved in the healthcare and
Panasonic divisions.
Overseas sales rose by 35 per cent to NZDollars 160m, and now represent 44
per cent of trading revenue, up from 39 per cent last year.
Australian white goods sales were up 47 per cent to NZDollars 104m,
representing a growth in market share in all categories.
Increased production also lifted sales to Asia, where the company has
developed products suited to the climate. New Zealand sales rose by 11 per
cent to NZDollars 91m, and Panasonic division sales by 8 per cent to
NZDollars 73.8m.
The interim dividend is up by one cent to nine cents.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Company News: Group to pay premium for SME
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italo-Swiss consortium that won the contest to buy the Italian state's
controlling stake in SME, the supermarket and restaurant group, will pay a
premium of more than 20 per cent for the shares.
Iri, the state holding company which controls SME, revealed on Friday that
the consortium had offered L4,847.4 for each SME share, against a market
price of just under L4,000. That values the whole company - which now owns
only the GS supermarkets and Autogrill restaurants business - at L2,200bn
(Dollars 1.4bn).
The consortium is led by Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's holding
company, allied with Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, who heads the Luxottica
spectacles group, Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, and
Crediop, the investment finance subsidiary of the San Paolo di Torino
banking group.
The consortium, which must keep GS and Autogrill together for five years,
will buy 32 per cent of SME from Iri then launch a public offer for a
further 32 per cent. Some of Iri's residual stake will be sold to the
consortium and the rest to ordinary investors.

third quarter

Domtar, the Canadian forest products, packaging and building materials group
which last month replaced its president and chief executive after a
boardroom policy dispute, has returned to profitability in its third
quarter, with net profit of CDollars 22m or 16 cents a share, against a loss
of CDollars 22m or 18 cents a share a year earlier.
Operating profit was CDollars 64m (USDollars 47.2m) against a loss of
CDollars 2m, and sales were up 31 per cent to CDollars 573m.
Nine-month net profit was CDollars 41m or 30 cents a share against a loss of
CDollars 85m or 69 cents a share. Sales were CDollars 1.5bn, against
CDollars 1.25bn.
Domtar, which is 42 per cent owned by two Quebec government agencies, was
restructured in 1992-93 after heavy losses due to the long north American
recession. Its two newsprint mills were sold in a CDollars 280m public offer
last spring.
The pulp and fine paper and packaging divisions posted a 21 per cent
third-quarter gain in sales, benefiting from higher product prices and a
weaker Canadian dollar. Most production is exported in US dollars.
Linerboard prices passed the 1989 peak.
The building materials division, which includes timber, wallboard and
decorative panels and has plants in Canada and the US, improved operating
results. Plans to sell the wallboard business have been deferred.
'We are now well positioned to make substantial gains during this economic
cycle,' said Mr Stephen Larson, who has taken over as president.
Domtar also plans capital outlays of about CDollars 350m in the next two
years to raise efficiency and meet new pollution standards.
Investors Group, a financial services subsidiary of Power Corp of Canada,
posted a net profit of CDollars 61.4m or 58 cents a share for the nine
months to September on revenues of CDollars 414m, up from CDollars 48.7m or
46 cents a share on revenues of CDollars 468m. Sales of mutual funds were
firm at CDollars 3.4bn.

<TEXT>
London United, the west London bus company, has been bought by its staff in
a Pounds 22.9m deal, backed by Montagu Private Equity and 3i, the investment
capital group.
It becomes the ninth London bus company to be sold by London Regional
Transport this year and almost completes LRT's privatisation programme which
so far has raised more than Pounds 211m.
London United, operates 450 buses in south-west London, as well as the
Heathrow to central London Airbus. It employs 1,450 staff and had Pounds
36.6m turnover in the year to March 1994.

FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ordinary holders may get small part of
Queens Moat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ordinary investors in Queens Moat Houses, the heavily-indebted hotels group,
may find their shares are not completely worthless when the protracted
Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring is agreed later this month.
Initial indications are that ordinary shareholders will be left with a
slice, albeit small, of the company which is expected to seek a relisting in
the new year.
The battle to keep ordinary shareholders in the picture has not been an easy
one. There had been strong demand from banks to leave ordinary shareholders
with little more than option paper.
However, a Queens Moat adviser said this weekend that 'shareholders may be
pleasantly surprised' when they read the details of the refinancing.
These are likely to be published at the end of this month or early next and
will include a substantial debt-for-equity swap and extended maturity dates
on certain tranches of debt.
Before that can happen, however, Queens Moat's 74 lenders will all have to
sign on the dotted line. Reaching agreement in principle - a stage which
Queens Moat is expected to complete almost any day now - is only the first
step.
After that, it is likely to take between two and three weeks for the banks
to return the official documentation, which will allow Queens Moat to
present its hard-won refinancing to shareholders.
Investors will then have three weeks in which to peruse the details before
being asked to vote on the issue at an extraordinary general meeting. If
approved, the refinancing can start and the company will then approach the
Stock Exchange for a relisting.
All this means that shareholders are not likely to see a refinancing
circular before the end of this month, or possibly early next. A relisting
will certainly not be possible before next year.
Such delays should be familiar to the thousands of investors who have been
largely left in the dark for the past year.
In spite of almost immediate support from most of the group's 74 lenders
when proposals were first sent out in April this year, the process has been
held up by a number of behind-the-scenes setbacks. These have included
disputes with lessors of certain hotels over concessions to be made as part
of the package and objections from secondary-debt traders.
Most of the objections have now been resolved. Only Trust Company of the US
 -which bought Queens Moat debt in the secondary market - and a continental
European bank are still holding out. Nevertheless, Queens Moat is confident
it will be able to complete the refinancing before Christmas.

FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New Tadpole PC will tap greater market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tadpole Technology, market leader in high performance notebook workstations,
will announce today that it has developed the world's most powerful portable
personal computer.
The new machine will be available from the beginning of next year. It will
give the Cambridge-based manufacturer access to a vastly greater market than
its existing workstations, which are intended chiefly for scientists and
engineers.
Workstations are more powerful than PCs and are correspondingly more
expensive.
According to Mr George Grey, Tadpole chief executive, the P 1000 is likely
to find a ready market among personal computer users with a need for
substantial computing power on the move. He gives as examples
three-dimensional modelling, multimedia demonstrations, data collection and
real-time analysis.
Tadpole's reputation rests on its ability to shoehorn complex computing
electronics into notebook sized packages.

FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: TeleWest attracts institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutional interest is believed to be considerable in the flotation of
TeleWest, the largest cable company in the UK and the first to come for a
London listing.
The pathfinder document to be published today will suggest a likely value
for the company - a joint venture between TCI of Denver, the largest US
cable operator, and US West the regional US telephone company - of between
Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.9bn. The company will place about 20 per cent of
its ordinary shares in London and New York in a move designed to raise
between Pounds 300m and Pounds 390m in new money.
The flotation will test the market for new media stock in advance of the
much larger British Sky Broadcasting float later in December.
Although satellite television has more than four times the number of
subscribers as the cable networks, many analysts see cable as the better
long-term bet because it can offer a wide range of services apart from
television, including telecommunications and new interactive services.
Mr Fred Vierra, executive vice-president of TCI responsible for
international operations will become non-executive chairman of TeleWest.
The non-executive directors will include Sir Gordon Borrie, former director
general of Fair Trading and a current non-executive director of the Mirror
Group, which has recently announced its intention to launch a new television
channel for cable networks.

FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Smallest companies outperform the rest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The very smallest companies are continuing to outperform all other sectors
so far this year, according to Hoare Govett's new smaller company index.
Over the first three quarters of 1994, the HG 1000 index produced a return
of 4.4 per cent, or 6.7 per cent for the version excluding investment
trusts, compared with negative returns of between 0.7 and 8.5 per cent for
the FT-SE 100, 350, All-share, Mid 250 and Smallcap.
The HG 1000 index, which was launched officially in August but has been
calculated since the start of 1993, covers the bottom 2 per cent by market
capitalisation of the UK equity market, excluding investment trusts.
When investment trusts within the same market capitalisation limits are
included, the trust has 1,000 constituents. The largest companies in the
index have market capitalisations of just over Pounds 50m; the smallest are
under Pounds 1m, and more than half are valued at less than Pounds 15m,
though in value terms, half the index is accounted for by companies
capitalised at Pounds 30m or more.
During 1993, the HG 1000 index produced returns of 60.8 per cent (60.4 per
cent excluding investment trusts), compared with returns of less than 30 per
cent for the FT-SE 100, 350 and All-Share. Hoare Govett's main smaller
companies index, the HGSC which covers the bottom 10 per cent of the market,
returned 44 per cent.
When the index was back-calculated to 1955, its average annual total return
was 21.1 per cent a year, against 14.5 per cent for the All-share and 18.7
per cent for the HGSC.
A report on the index says it acts as a complement to the FT-SE-A All-Share
index: 99 per cent of the All-Share's constituents are too large to be
included in the HG 1000.
However, the report's authors acknowledge that liquidity can be a problem at
this end of the market.

FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Vultures ready to pick the weakest - A
likely shake-out in the life insurance industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vultures seem to be hovering over some UK life insurance companies.
Across the sector, companies have had to cope with the rising costs of
meeting increasingly tough regulatory standards, and have had to accept that
selling opportunities are being forgone as sales forces spend more time
being trained.
These difficulties come against a background of widespread public concern
about the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to people opting or
transferring out of occupational schemes, which has depressed new business.
A further consequence is that many independent financial advisers are likely
to go out of business in the process of compensating the victims of poor
pensions advice. This would intensify competition among life insurers to win
business through the remaining independent advisers.
Even before the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, focused attention on the cost of pensions compensation - which
one estimate puts at Pounds 2bn - a forecast by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow
suggested that within a decade about 40 life companies would be struggling
still to sell life insurance.
Just two days after that forecast was published in late September, the life
sector received a further reminder of the fragility of some companies. Sir
Mark Weinberg, a leading figure in the UK life industry, announced plans for
a new company with Pounds 100m capital to acquire life companies, close them
to new business and manage their existing funds.
Though Sir Mark dislikes the term, the venture is a version of what many in
the life sector call 'vulture life'. It depends on picking up life companies
which can no longer survive on their own and living off the business they
have already acquired.
The plan is a joint venture with New York Life Worldwide, whose subsidiary,
Windsor Life, has already been in this line of business in a smaller way.
All this has sharpened interest in which companies are the weakest and what
the options available to them are.
Mr John Wybrew, chairman of Windsor Life and chief executive of the new
company, sees small and medium-sized mutual insurers as most vulnerable.
They are owned by their policyholders, and cannot raise money through
shareholders. They could thus suffer from lack of access to capital.
On the other hand, the lack of any institutional shareholder reduces the
prospect that a company's management would find itself forced to address its
future if it did not want to do so. The other category widely identified as
potentially vulnerable is small and medium-sized subsidiaries of overseas
parent companies.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow's report showed that the 37 life companies of this type had
the highest average expense ratio in the sector, putting them in a weak
position if competition took the form of a price war.
Two other characteristics could also be important for this type of company.
First, they could be particularly hard hit by the need to compensate victims
of poor pensions advice. As 'unit-linked' companies, the structure of the
policies they sell does not give them the discretion available to companies
selling 'with profits' policies, where significant amounts of money in free
reserves have not been strictly allocated to policyholders.
Second, the decision would ultimately be not for the management of the life
company but for the parent group, which could be approached directly by a
predator and might decide it was time to leave an increasingly competitive
UK market.
For companies deciding that they cannot survive alone, there seems broadly
two options: sale to a 'vulture fund' or takeover by a large insurer which
would want to keep them as part of a continuing business. The expectation is
that many managements in that position would prefer to be part of a going
concern.
Sir Mark, however, identifies a third option - splitting a life company and
selling different elements to different buyers.
'There is no reason why a company shouldn't be unbundled into a sales
operation and a closed fund,' he says. It offers a chance for the company
buying a sales force to improve its distribution capacity quickly, without
the costs of recruiting and training.
As an example of demand for direct sales forces alone, he points to Allied
Dunbar's payment in March for the right to recruit the 600-plus sales force
available when Hill Samuel closed to new life and pensions business.
This approach depends on the sales operations being seen as a separate
source of value rather than of expense. Mr Michael Wadsworth, a partner at
consulting actuaries Watsons, is not convinced.
'Usually in those circumstances, the distribution is not worth very much,
either because the sales operation is not very good quality, or because - in
the case of a company selling through independent advisers - it merely
replicates the potential purchaser's existing ability to sell,' he says.
The gloom over the sector need not translate into a cull of life companies
tomorrow: even the smallest have millions of pounds in funds and do not need
to decide immediately that they cannot survive. The longer-term trends mean,
however, that the vultures will continue to circle.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Lloyd's capacity forecast to shrink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underwriting capacity of Lloyd's of London will shrink next year - in
spite of the injection of fresh capital from corporate investors, according
to Mr Peter Middleton, the insurance market's chief executive.
Lloyd's authorities are expected to begin work next year on a three-year
business plan, to start in 1996. They hope that 1996 and 1997 will mark a
decisive revival in the market's prospects after the heavy losses reported
in recent years.
Mr Middleton said Lloyd's had to make substantial progress in cost control
if it was to ride out an anticipated downturn in insurance rates. He hinted
that the trend towards direct policy writing would lead to a review of the
market's relationship with its brokers.
He added that one of the most decisive events would involve Newco - the
company Lloyd's has set up to take over outstanding liabilities on old
policies, particularly US asbestosis and pollution claims dating from the
1940s.
Mr Middleton envisages putting the 1985 and prior liabilities into Newco at
the end of 1995. He said the other 'open years' - 1986 and later - would be
put into Newco at the end of 1996.
Lloyd's leaders believe that if Newco is successful, corporate capital could
be attracted back to a trouble-freed Lloyd's. That scenario, however, also
assumes a settlement is reached with the loss-making Names seeking
compensation in court.
Mr Middleton said applications had been made by about 30 corporate vehicles
to enter the market next year. But investors' appetites have waned, with
shares in most quoted Lloyd's companies trading below listing price. Mr
Middleton forecast corporate investment next year would be only about Pounds
250m more than the Pounds 900m committed in 1994 (the first in which
corporate capital was allowed).
Under Lloyd's rules determining the amount of business being underwritten,
that should increase capacity by about Pounds 500m. But an estimated 1,000
Names have resigned and others are expected to reduce their underwriting in
1995. Thus total capacity is forecast by Mr Middleton to fall to between
about Pounds 9.25bn and Pounds 9.5bn from Pounds 10.9bn in 1994.

Analysts predict BT second-quarter pre-tax profits of Pounds 750m to Pounds
800m, after about Pounds 100m in redundancy charges but before a Pounds 75m
repurchase of bonds. That compares with Pounds 743m last year after
redundancy charges, giving underlying profits growth at mid-point of about
4.5 per cent. Interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 550m (Dollars 902m) to
Pounds 580m are forecast for C&amp;W, which at mid-point is about 11 per cent up
on last year's Pounds 509m. Continued strong growth at Hongkong Telecom,
C&amp;W's largest profit earner, will be offset by slower growth at Mercury, its
UK subsidiary, which is fighting rising competition.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Deutsche Bank braced for battle

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank will mount a legal challenge to any move by the German
government to force it to reduce its equity holdings in companies without
tax relief, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Deutsche's managing
board.
Mr Kopper said that Deutsche would take its case to the Federal
Constitutional Court if political objections to the level of its holdings -
which surfaced in Germany's recent election campaign - resulted in legal
curbs.
He said in an interview with the Financial Times that such a move would
constitute expropriation of assets. 'Why should a citizen of this country be
forced to divest some of his assets and share the proceeds with the
government?' he said.
Its holdings, including 24.4 per cent of Daimler-Benz, the vehicle and
aerospace group, have a market value of DM25bn (Pounds 10.2bn). The proceeds
from sales would be subject to taxes of around 60 per cent on realised
capital gains.
'If we were forced to sell off, and that would mean paying taxes on
unrealised gains, we would think that was definitely unconstitutional,' said
Mr Kopper. He said he believed this point was so clear that no such law
would be passed.
Before October's election, the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
proposed a law requiring banks to cut industrial holdings. It is likely to
be reintroduced in the next session, but with little chance of success.
However, some members of the Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior party
in the Bonn coalition, also support a reduction and political debate about
banks' influence on industry continues.
Among other companies in which Deutsche Bank has significant stakes are
Allianz, Europe's largest insurance group (10 per cent), Continental, tyres
(10.5 per cent) and Philipp Holzmann, construction (25.9 per cent).
Deutsche has a policy of trying to reduce its larger equity stakes - many of
which were acquired in debt-for-equity swaps when the companies concerned
were in trouble - in order to diversify its industrial portfolio.
Mr Kopper said that the bank wanted to keep its portfolio at the same size,
but would be interested in buying holdings outside Germany, particularly in
other European countries.
Although bank shareholdings account for less than 1 per cent of all quoted
German companies' market capitalisation, the high visibility of some stakes
has led to adverse publicity.
As the holdings were mostly acquired many years ago, their valuation in the
balance sheet is well below market levels. 'Their book value is low, and the
yield that they generate is very good as a stabilising factor in our profit
and loss account,' Mr Kopper said.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Ice cream sweetens third-quarter
profits - Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Soaring ice cream sales could be the third-quarter success story Unilever
chooses to highlight on Friday when it reports a rise of some 9 per cent in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 710m.
The Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, the world's largest ice cream
maker, will be grateful for any topic which takes minds off its detergents
war with Procter &amp; Gamble.
Since this spring's launch of Persil Power washing powder in the UK and Omo
Power on the continent, P&amp;G has exploited the products' flaw. Its manganese
catalyst reacts with some dyes, leading to a deterioration in the textiles.
Unilever says the problem is now under control.
Unilever points out that the detergent forms only some 1 1/2 per cent of its
global sales. The research, development and marketing expenditure on the
powder has been large, however. Sales, sharply curtailed by bad publicity,
are a long way from giving a reasonable return on the investment.
Ice cream is a different story. Unilever has 40 per cent of the Pounds 6bn
European market, and an upturn in the third quarter should lift total
European profits, which were flat at the half-yearstage. North American
profits should get a boost from the acquired Breyers ice cream business.
Personal products, such as soaps and shampoos, and specialty chemicals, will
also contribute to the upturn.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts predict better results
than expected - S G Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment bank S. G. Warburg on Tuesday will announce earnings for the six
months ended September 30. Securities analysts are offering no prizes for
guessing the results.
Last month Warburg put out a profits warning, saying it expected to report
earnings of Pounds 55m to Pounds 65m for the period, down sharply from the
Pounds 148.8m in the same period in 1993.
Analysts at BZW predict the actual number will be near the higher end of the
forecast range. However, those at James Capel estimate that the actual
profits may prove somewhat higher than the gloomy forecast would suggest.
Even so, analysts said the investment banking division is unlikely to have
provided shareholders with a return on capital of more than one per cent.
Given that Warburg's 75 per cent-owned subsidiary, Mercury Asset Management,
has said it expects earnings for the period to be somewhat above the Pounds
50.4m it reported last year, the statement suggests the invest-ment bank's
profits were very modest.
Mr Philip Gibbs, analyst at BZW, notes that the investment bank has several
divisions such as custody and sales-aid leasing which alone could account
for the difference between the MAM profits and the Warburg full group
profits.
'You must have made a profit in some areas. A profit as low as that implies
that a particular area must be in loss,' he said.
Indeed, analysts said, Warburg's profits picture underscores the merits of
maintaining a healthy asset management arm. This is particularly important
for an integrated investment bank whose earnings are at the whim of volatile
securities markets, they said.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Salomon forces directors to share pain as well as gains: A
controversial bonds market pay move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Is Salomon Brothers turning into Goldman Sachs? Thirteen years after Salomon
went public, the Wall Street bond trading firm appears to be metamorphosing
back into a private partnership.
Just like its celebrated rival Goldman, Salomon has come to the conclusion
that the best way to motivate its top executives - the ones who generate the
bulk of the firm's earnings - is to tie their pay directly to performance.
This way, the interests of the employees are closer to the interests of the
whole firm.
However, Salomon is not going to mimic Goldman exactly. Salomon is owned by
its shareholders, and there are no plans for a management-led buy-out. Nor
are there plans to use senior executives' money as risk-taking capital, as
happens at true private partnerships such as Goldman.
Instead, Salomon's ruling triumvirate - chairman Mr Robert Denham, chief
executive Mr Deryck Maughan, and chief shareholder Mr Warren Buffett - are
seeking to create a hybrid, what Mr Maughan likes to call a 'synthesis of
public capital and private partnership'.
Ten days ago, Salomon took the first step towards that goal when it unveiled
a new system for compensating the 140 or so managing directors in its
client-related businesses - the top bankers, salesmen, traders and analysts
who serve the broking and investment banking needs of Salomon's
institutional clients.
Under the new pay plan, which will be introduced in January, the managing
directors will be paid a guaranteed minimum annual salary totalling just 35
per cent of their 1994 compensation. They will not begin to earn any bonuses
(which traditionally make up the bulk of their earnings) until the entire
client-driven business earns at least a 7 per cent return on equity capital.
Once that threshold has been exceeded, the managing directors will receive
40 per cent of any additional profits.
At the same time, a new pay plan is being introduced in Salomon's
proprietary trading operations, where the firm trades its own money in the
financial markets. From next year, managing directors in proprietary trading
will be paid from multi-year deferred accounts. These accounts will pool
traders' bonuses over a period of several years, but if proprietary trading
loses money at any time during the period, some of the bonuses from
profitable years will be retrieved from the pool.
The aim of the new compensation plan at Salomon is to introduce a notion
that is truly radical by the standards of Wall Street's public firms -
downward mobility in managing directors' pay.
Salomon's management believes the lack of pay flexibility is the problem
with the current system. At the moment, when the firm prospers, so do the
highest-paid employees, in the form of big bonuses. The shareholders also
benefit, in the form of a higher Salomon share price and dividends. When
Salomon suffers, the shareholders bear the brunt of the poor performance
through a lower share price and dividends, while the managing directors are
cushioned by compensation packages that are generous enough to ensure
Salomon's pay remains competitive.
This divergence between pay and performance is exactly what Salomon is
experiencing this year. Barring a spectacular recovery in the fourth
quarter, the firm will lose money in 1994, while employee compensation will
decline only slightly (currently, pay costs are down only 7 per cent
compared to a year ago).
While the new pay system may help Salomon control its costs better in coming
years, it will do nothing to address the underlying problems that have left
the firm nursing losses on both its client-driven and proprietary trading
businesses this year.
Salomon remains relatively sanguine about the poor performance of its
trading unit, which has lost Dollars 21m (Pounds 12.8m) so far this year.
The firm points out that its proprietary trading strategies are designed to
be profitable over the long-term, and says that the results of the business
should not be judged over any period shorter than four quarters (over the
last 12 months, proprietary trading has made a profit of Dollars 487m).
Salomon has had a harder time explaining why its client-driven business has
performed so badly.
Salomon has lost Dollars 526m on its client-driven business so far this
year, compared to profits of Dollars 805m in the same period of 1993. This
dramatic deterioration was attributed to mismanagement of derivative-like
securities known as collateralised mortgage obligations (CMOs). The value of
CMOs plunged earlier this year when the mortgage-backed bond market slumped.
Since then, Salomon says it has cleaned up the mortgage-backed mess,
bringing in new management to the department, selling off a large part of
its inventory of CMOs, and introducing strict new position limits for its
traders. The rest of its client-driven business, the firm insists, is
healthy.
Salomon's managing directors must hope so, because from January, their
meagre salaries will only be supplemented if the client-driven business
generates substantial profits.
The firm says that the changes to compensation have the support of most of
its managing directors, but admits there is some unhappiness. To reassure
them that the changes are for the good, Mr Maughan has already begun to talk
of the role of 'partners' at the firm. As a former Goldman Sachs investment
banker, Salomon's chief executive knows only too well about the risks and
rewards of partnerships. His managing directors can only hope that in the
coming years, the rewards will compensate for the risks.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Nissan's investment at UK plant passes Pounds 1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan's car plant at Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, has become the first
Japanese manufacturing venture in Europe to invest more than Pounds 1bn.
The plant is entering a new phase likely to create a further 25,000 direct
and indirect jobs - mostly in the hard hit north-east - over the next 10-15
years, according to Mr Ian Gibson, chief executive of Nissan Motor
Manufacturing (UK).
Nissan's UK manufacturing operations, which today mark their 10th
anniversary since the foundation stone was laid on the 800-acre Sunderland
site, have taken spending past the Pounds 1bn mark by starting construction
of a Pounds 33m axle-manufacturing plant and a further upgrading of vehicle
painting and other facilities.
The axle factory is due to start production in 1996, when a replacement for
the current Primera range of medium-sized cars is introduced.
When operational it will mean that Nissan UK will have virtually a fully
integrated production facility, including foundry and pressings facilities.
The only significant components still expected to be imported from Japan
will be engine blocks and gearboxes, accounting for about 8 per cent of each
car's value.
Mr Gibson made his jobs prediction 24 hours after the new frigate HMS
Richmond slipped down the nearby River Tyne. After 18 months in
receivership, its builder, Swan Hunter, now appears unlikely to escape
closure, and the shipbuilding that was the region's economic mainstay for
many years will end.
The additional 25,000 Nissan-related jobs will not come, in the main, from
the Sunderland plant, although it is expected to increase capacity from
300,000 cars a year to 400,000 by the end of the decade. Instead they will
come from additional industrial and commercial activities for which Nissan
UK is already acting as the catalyst, Mr Gibson said.
'If you go to Stuttgart, for example, you see a great heap of companies that
no longer look like automotive businesses but which needed the presence of
Mercedes and Porsche to get them going: metal fabricators, toolmaking,
design services, all providing an industrial infrastructure for a range of
activities which would not otherwise have existed.
'We're only now starting that infrastructure stage in the north-east. It
will be another 10 years in growing, but there is an enormous growth in
economic activity to come.'
Nissan companies on the site employ almost 5,000 people, with nearly 10,000
more jobs estimated to have been created in Nissan's 200 component
suppliers, 130 of which are UK-based.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Companies to test electronic filing of tax returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sample group of up to 1,000 UK companies will from today have their
corporation tax returns filed directly to the Inland Revenue by computer
link.
The scheme aims to replace costly letters and telephone calls and to bring
closer the goal of direct filing from accountants, companies and home-based
personal computers.
If the pilot exercise succeeds, a national system of electronic filing may
be available for all the 1m corporation tax returns made in a year.
In 1996 the Revenue plans to try the system on its new self-assessment
personal tax forms. Up to 5m taxpayers may be using the so-called Electronic
Lodgement Service through accountants by 2001.
The Big Six accountancy firms, acting as agents for clients, have joined the
project.
The Revenue, which is under government pressure to cut costs, sees large
savings in the scheme, with the aim of eventually eliminating routine paper
tax correspondence.
Accountants and other agents envisage fewer immediate benefits, and are
pressing the Revenue to introduce a flat-rate payment to those filing
electronically.
They are also unhappy with the costs of the pilot project, which initially
has to be run in tandem with the existing paper-based system.
The voluntary project, running until March 1995, aims to test the technology
and see whether accountants, software houses and the Revenue can work
together.
From today, tax returns from the sample companies will be filed via modem
from the accountants through a message 'gateway' at the Revenue's offices in
Basingstoke.
The electronic version of the tax return will be the one used by the Revenue
 -not the paper backup. The software is being provided by Taxsoft and Data
Sciences.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Airbus moves to strengthen links with Chinese market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft manufacturing consortium, will
invest Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) in a new flight crew training centre in
Beijing to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing Chinese market.
Mr Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus Industrie, said the agreement
signed at the weekend with the China Aviation Supplies Corporation (CASC)
was 'only the first step' in a series of such measures planned for the next
few years.
Airbus Industrie's push follows similar moves by its main competitors,
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, both of which have announced steps recently to
bolster their position in China.
McDonnell Douglas signed an agreement last Friday for the sale of 40 MD-80s
and MD-90s to Chinese airlines. Half of those aircraft will be manufactured
in China, with US-supplied parts.
The Airbus chief executive said the company would also establish a
maintenance centre in Beijing to help the Chinese acquire advanced
engineering and aircraft servicing skills.
Work on the flight training centre is expected to be completed by early
1996. It will be run as a joint venture between CASC and Airbus and will
offer similar facilities to those established by the Euro-consortium in
Toulouse and Miami.
Mr Pierson, who met China's president Jiang Zemin at the weekend, said the
consortium would use its 'muscle' with European governments to argue
Beijing's case for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He
said Europe should 'spearhead' China's accession to the Gatt.
The McDonnell Douglas deal puts greater pressure on Boeing and Airbus to
further 'sweeten' deals negotiated with China on the sale of new aircraft.
Boeing, in its efforts to preserve its leading position in the Chinese
market, signed an agreement in August for the manufacture of the aft section
of its 737 twin-engine aircraft in China. The deal is estimated to be worth
about Dollars 600m.
Airbus, which has sold 35 wide-bodied aircraft to China since 1985,
indicated it would compete more aggressively with US manufacturers to
increase its share of what is expected to be a vast market for new aircraft
in China over the next 15 years.
Mr Pierson said Airbus aimed to capture half of new sales compared with the
one-third share it had secured in the past five years. Airbus expects China
to buy 620 aircraft in the next 15 years at a cost of about Dollars 30bn.
That compares with a forecast by Chase Manhattan bank that China's passenger
fleet of 350 aircraft will increase fivefold by 2010, requiring the purchase
of 1,200 new aircraft worth Dollars 90bn. Boeing predicts sales of 800
aircraft at a cost of Dollars 40bn.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: European chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European chemicals groups reported strong third-quarter profits last week.
The scale and speed of recovery has been impressive. Increased volumes and
sharply improved prices - in the case of high density polyethylene up 65 per
cent year on year - helped drive earnings sharply upwards. The recession's
cost-cutting also bore fruit, substantially boosting profits. With the
biggest commodity chemicals' price increases implemented towards the end of
the third quarter, the final quarter promises to be even better.
Those companies benefiting most are involved in upstream activities -
supplying plastics, titanium dioxide and other raw materials. Profits at BP
Chemicals rose 60 per cent during the first nine months, while DSM turned an
after-tax loss during last year's third quarter to a profit this time. Those
closer to the customer are doing less well, squeezed between higher raw
material costs and consumers' unwillingness to accept higher prices. ICI's
paints division and Akzo Nobel were most obviously in discomfort.
The shares of ICI, DSM and Akzo all fell on profit-taking after their
results. The only exception was Rhone-Poulenc which surprised the market
with better than expected figures. The question remains whether the chemical
industry's recovery has been fully discounted. If the recovery is as brief
as in the last cycle, the shares may be fully valued. But the market may
have miscalculated and this cycle could be considerably longer than previous
ones. That will depend partly on demand, particularly in Asia. The other
factor is supply, which is entirely in the industry's own hands.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: German governance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A consensus is emerging within Germany that aspects of the country's
corporate governance need improvement. This is to be welcomed by the foreign
shareholders who own a large proportion of the freely-traded shares in
German quoted companies. Cosy boardroom ties between management, banks and
labour have engendered a slack approach to delivering value to shareholders.
The dismantling of some of these ties, combined with greater disclosure,
will encourage management accountability to the broad mass of shareholders.
Their legitimate desire for profits and dividends to be maximised should
thus be better served.
Despite the talk, there have so far been regrettably few tangible changes to
German governance. Deutsche Bank and Daimler-Benz have set up audit
committees - a step designed to correct some of the control weaknesses
revealed in the two-tier board system. But their example has not been widely
followed. No other German company has followed Daimler's brave lead in
reporting its figures according to US accounting rules. None of the large
German conglomerates has taken steps to unbundle itself aggressively with
the aim of unlocking shareholder value.
The impending privatisation of Deutsche Telekom could do the cause of
governance a good service. So great is the company's need for capital that
it will be obliged to woo international investors more seriously than any
other German institution to date. Telekom should follow Daimler's lead and
seek a full listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's report from the Bank of England widened the gulf between the
Bank's and the market's expectations of inflation. While the Bank cut its
medium-term forecast to 2.5 per cent, the market's view - as expressed by
the difference between yields on conventional and index-linked gilts -
remained nearly twice that. If the Bank is right, the relationship between
conventional and index-linked gilts must change. The question is which side
will move.
Index-linked gilts look cheap compared with equities. In August UK equity
yields fell below those on index-linked gilts for the first time since
before the 1987 crash. Equities have since slipped back but their yield
premium is still under 10 basis points. Although lower than normal, such a
narrow spread could persist if the market is willing to accept a lower risk
premium for equities than it used to demand or if dividend growth prospects
are particularly strong at this stage in the economic cycle.
The yield on index-linked gilts, at around 4 per cent, is consistent with
the outlook for real interest rates. So if the gap between the market's and
Bank's views on inflation is to close, yields on conventional gilts are
likely to fall further. Over the last six weeks gilts have outpaced other
government bonds. It would not be surprising if there was now a pause. But
with UK institutions signalling a clear intention to increase their
weighting in recent surveys, there is good reason to expect continued
relative outperformance.

Pity the Stock Exchange. When it announced the closure of the Unlisted
Securities Market, politicians and representatives of small companies
pressed for a change of heart. So against its initial judgment, the exchange
decided that a new Alternative Investment Market should rise to take the
USM's place. It plans to create a lightly-regulated market which does not
impose excessive costs on small companies.
Unfortunately, support is draining away. The fund management group M&amp;G says
it will not invest its unit trust money in the market because insufficient
regulation will make it too risky for its investors. The City Group for
Smaller Companies, the most vocal lobbyist for a new junior market, has
become more enthusiastic about a rival scheme to create a European-wide
market for entrepreneurial companies, modelled on America's Nasdaq exchange.
The Stock Exchange is in a bind. If the regulatory burden is kept low,
shareholders may be shy of investing. But if regulatory standards are
raised, small companies may decide it is not worth the effort and cost.
There may be some way of achieving a compromise. But one cannot help
thinking that the exchange should have stuck to its initial view that there
was no commercial case for setting up a 'son-of-USM' and resisted the
political pressures to do so. The field would then have been clear for
private groups to set up their own junior markets - if, that is, they had
bright enough ideas and could show that the business case added up.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Hopeful signs of a reversal of fortune: Hilmar Kopper's
plans to rebuild Deutsche Bank's reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The old Banco de Madrid signs have been taken down from 300 branches across
Spain, and those of Banca d'America e d'Italia are disappearing in Italy. In
their place sits the familiar line-and-box symbol of their owner, Deutsche
Bank. After a year of travails and controversy in Germany, Mr Hilmar Kopper,
Deutsche's chairman, does not disguise his delight that his bank's name
retains its prestige elsewhere in Europe.
Sitting in his wood-panelled office in Frankfurt, Mr Kopper recounts how the
two banks asked to be re-branded. Their customers liked the idea of banking
with Deutsche despite finding the name difficult to pronounce. 'Clients seem
to like it, and they will practise very hard to be able to tell their
relatives what their bank is called,' he says, his shoulders shaking with
amusement.
Mr Kopper has had few chances to laugh this year. Many Germans enjoyed the
sight of their biggest bank being toppled from its pedestal by the Schneider
and Metallgesellschaft affairs. This not only revived traditional German
antipathy to the Macht der Banken (power of the banks), but raised doubts
about Deutsche's reputation for strong management. Its shares slid against
the market as it lost its premium rating. On the eve of Deutsche's 125th
anniversary next year, he and his fellow managing board members found
themselves in the unfamiliar position of struggling to restore the bank's
reputation.
They have not found it easy. Mr Kopper's remark that the DM50m (Pounds 21m)
trade debts left by Mr Jurgen Schneider when his property group collapsed
earlier this year with total debts of DM5bn were 'peanuts', reinforced
Deutsche's image of arrogance. And the incidents have re-kindled debate over
whether banks' equity stakes in large companies - such as Deutsche's 24.4
per cent stake in Daimler-Benz - lead to conflicts of interest.
Deutsche was dragged into the Metallgesellschaft affair because it not only
lent money to the mining, metals and industrial group, but held a 10.6 per
cent stake. Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche managing board member, chaired
Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board as a result.
All this has happened as Deutsche wrestles with restructuring its
1,506-branch domestic bank, trying to devolve more power to local managers
(see below). 'It has obviously been a tough year for them,' says Mr John
Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, the investment bank,
'They have been in the news more than they would have liked, in
circumstances they would not have chosen.'
Yet in the last months of the year, Deutsche shows signs not only of
regaining stability, but striking back. The bank announced 10 days ago that
it will base investment banking operations in London, and integrate more
closely with Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank it acquired five years ago.
This is a sign of new aggression in the competition for investment banking
business with other large European banks.
Mr Kopper, who took over as chairman of the managing board five years ago
when Alfred Herrhausen was assassinated, accepts that it may never regain
all its mystique, but insists that respect remains. 'That has not been
shaken at all. There is the same amount of trust, confidence and stability.
What has changed is that it has become more popular to talk about banks.
There is much less of a taboo,' he says.
He dismisses the idea that Metallgesellschaft or Schneider will have a
lasting impact, describing the former's losses in futures trading as 'a
wonderful story for textbooks of what a management board can do wrong'. The
latter, he insists, was a one-off.
Yet Mr Kopper admits that Deutsche has been afflicted by the same reputation
for being uniquely powerful that it used to enjoy. 'I sometimes wonder why
we are looked at that way. We try to explain what we can - and cannot - do,'
he says, 'Of course, there is some mystique, which one enjoys as long as it
is positive. It is less enjoyable when negative connotations are attached,
which seems to be the case now.'
Ridicule matters less than the possibility that hostility to banks will
encourage legislation forcing them to reduce stakes in companies to 5 or 10
per cent of those companies' equity. Although Deutsche has a policy of
reducing stakes - and withdrawing from supervisory boards - forced disposals
would cost it dearly in tax as it realised large capital gains from stakes
held at the original value.
Mr Kopper says that such legislation would be against the German
constitution, and would be challenged by Deutsche in court. Further, he
insists that banks are good shareholders. 'A bank is a shareholder that
reacts in a responsible way in line with the interests of the company it has
invested in, not its own,' he says.
Deutsche wants to maintain its portfolio because the yield from dividends
helps to smooth cyclical earnings from lending and volatile trading income.
The latter was more than halved in the first half of this year because of
bond market turmoil. Mr Kopper says he wants to reduce volatility in
earnings, and also to diversify its sources of income geographically, one of
the motives behind the investment banking move.
By comparison with most other European banks, Deutsche has expanded boldly
in European retail banking, with acquisitions in Italy and Spain, where
margins are high. But it has been more cautious than Swiss and US banks in
investment banking. It has not expanded fast in equity underwriting and
broking, or financial derivatives, both unfamiliar for a bank from a country
that lacks sophisticated capital markets.
It has also been slower than competitors to absorb London firms, reaching a
40-page agreement with Morgan Grenfell in 1989 that prevented integration.
Mr Kopper says its ambitions have now grown. 'This is really the starting
point. We are making a major effort in these markets, a very daring move,'
he says. He talks of 'a lot of investment from every angle', to expand
international investment banking.
Yet Deutsche remains cautious in two ways. First, while an investment
banking board will now be in charge of both Morgan Grenfell and Deutsche's
activities, further integration will occur only 'in the most careful way'.
Mr Kopper argues that the bank has already gained from 'bundling the Morgan
abilities with the Deutsche abilities' but 'there is even more there than we
have been able to realise'.
Second, he emphasises that the bank wants to build investment banking
organically rather than through acquisition. Although it aims to build
equity broking strength in London, he says that 'we are quite able to build
this up ourselves from the grassroots to save the time- and money-consuming
process of integration'. This also goes for derivatives, a field in which
others have expanded by buying Chicago firms.
Mr Kopper admits that Deutsche 'may look weak' in terms of the notional
value of derivatives it trades compared with US and Swiss banks. However, it
believes 'a prudent approach is right' in a field that has been
controversial because of losses by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble.
This raises the broader question of whether the cautious and consensual
approach to management typified by the Deutsche managing board - 12
directors who meet each Tuesday and have collective responsibility - suits
the fast-moving world of investment banking. 'You have got 12 bosses, none
of whom strikes me as a weak individual, and that means they can be a little
slow,' says Mr Leonard.
Mr Kopper points out that the managing board approach has been varied by
having a single chief executive for investment banking. But he robustly
defends the underlying principle.
'This is one of the most successful banks in the world. I always hear that
this is not the best structure, and I don't know what is. But experience
suggests the Vorstand (managing board) structure is obviously desirable,' he
says.
It will therefore be a chastened, but unbowed Deutsche that faces next
year's anniversary. The bank's confidence last year was such that it
commissioned an official history to be published in 1995. It will include
chapters on the late 1930s and 1940s when it helped the Nazi government to
seize Jewish property and assets. Further disclosures could spoil the
celebrations, but Mr Kopper is unabashed.
'Maybe there is something new that we did not know about. I hope so, I hope
it will make interesting reading. I say we must be able to face up to
whatever it is,' he says.
It is an appropriate sentiment for a year in which Germany's most powerful
bank has seemed curiously vulnerable. But it may take more than the
admiration of Italian and Spanish customers to restore fully Deutsche's old
sense of superiority.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A job for the CBI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chancellor's 'Wise Men' and the Confederation of British Industry have
recently drawn attention to the plight of the unemployed. At a time when
many are pointing to other - more promising - features of the UK's economic
performance, they are right to remind the chancellor that a colossal labour
market failure remains.
The Treasury panel of independent economic forecasters is well-known for its
inability to reach a consensus about what Mr Kenneth Clarke should do next.
And yet - as a special section of its latest report points out - only one of
the Wise Men, Professor Patrick Minford, expects unemployment to fall much
below 2m during the next three years if the government does not make greater
efforts to reduce it.
Politically, nothing would do more to tarnish three further years of
recovery than a failure to get the unemployed back to work. But any policy
to reduce unemployment confronts a danger. Wage growth - one of the
traditional causes of inflation in the UK - has been unusually subdued in
the recovery to date. But this will not last long if many people stay out of
work so long that employers think they are no longer suitable for the jobs
available. Firms will then fill vacancies by offering higher wages, rather
than giving the jobs to the unemployed.
Re-connecting the long-term unemployed to the labour force is thus in
employers' own interests, and it was encouraging to see the CBI take up the
issue in a report published last week. Its study goes beyond the standard
prescriptions of more training and education, to suggest reforms which could
have a more immediate impact.
Predictably, the authors are better at identifying the government's failings
than in proposing ways of improving the contribution of employers. It
suggests reforms to the tax and benefit system to improve incentives to
offer, and accept, low-paid employment. Similarly, the CBI believes the
employment service could do more to bring companies and the unemployed
together.
There is much the government could do in these areas. But the report
implicitly recognises that sustainable economic growth, which will produce
jobs, will require changes in attitude as well as changes in policy.
The UK economy seems unable to employ a large proportion of its workforce
without stimulating inflation. This will change only if more employers
decide to fill vacancies with relatively low-paid workers, who must be
trained, rather than tempting their competitors' employees with higher wage
offers. On past experience, state subsidies can take companies only so far
down this route. Persuading the government to act in the long-term interest
of UK business is one thing. The CBI would do even more for the unemployed,
and the economy at large, if it convinced its members to do the same.

Dirty deeds in the office of Ramon Escovar Salom, Venezuela's minister of
the interior. He recently discovered bugging devices, planted there by hands
unknown. Suspicion lies against anonymous disgruntled former security
officers.
Not too surprising; in his role as prosecutor general, Escovar last year
laid corruption charges against president Carlos Andres Perez, ultimately
dislodging him from office.
Around that time Escovar started playing loud classical music in his office,
raising the volume when engaged in sensitive conversations. He says the
music 'helps to maintain my spiritual peace'.
Plenty of Wagner - that should scare them off.

Not high on everyone's list of emerging market possibilities, Uzbekistan is
among the former Russian republics or satellites being closely studied by
the First Russian Frontiers Trust, just set up by Pictet Asset Management.
It helps if you have an experienced pioneer, and Pictet's Douglas Polunin -
whose family originates from Russia - seems just the chap. His grandfather,
a renowned artist and stage designer, left St Petersburg in 1902 to settle
in Russian emigre circles in Paris. His father, Nicholas Polunin, an eminent
explorer, botanist and environmentalist, discovered Prince Charles Island in
the Arctic in the mid-1940s. Polunin himself was raised in Nigeria; he has
also lived in Baghdad and has a sister who runs a Buddhist centre in South
Korea.
If Tashkent gets him down, Polunin could always try writing a travel guide
to doing business in the world's difficult spots. Like London.

While hapless broadcasters at the BBC's central and east European language
services (mostly anti-communist emigres) in London's Bush House are
wondering how much longer they might have jobs - the end of the cold war
substantially eroding their raison d'etre - the corporation is gladly
reaping peace dividends where it can.
Bonuses are springing up in the oddest places. Audio tapes of a World
Service Radio history of the cold war - The World That Came in from the Cold
 -and 50,000 copies of an accompanying book have now been adopted as
teaching materials in 2,400 Slovak secondary schools.
Now that the Tory government seems to be running out of steam with the
mammoth privatisations of yesteryear, surely this creative approach from the
BBC might fruitfully be explored in other fields of government activity?
A further sword-into-ploughshare idea might be to send out to former
communist states the 500 GCHQ intelligence-gatherers the UK government now
plans to sack; they could surely find work as itinerant professors, from
Tirana to Bialystock?
Hmm. Probably unsound, on reflection - they might start spreading ugly
notions about industrial action.

Having done its best to absorb the financial and image-tarnishing
consequences of the Schneider property collapse, Deutsche Bank is meeting as
many of the claims of contractors on the property magnate's uncompleted
buildings as it feels are justified.
One demand will probably prove too much, however, even for a bank doing all
it can to repair the damage caused by Jurgen Schneider's wayward business
decisions and subsequent disappearance.
For the company which supplied champagne to Schneider - in rather large
quantities - has now presented its bill. Observer suspects it has about as
much chance of collecting its money from Deutsche as of squeezing a popped
cork back into a bottle of bubbly.

Some sweet news for Paddy Ashdown, the UK's Liberal Democrat party leader.
Sugar producer Tate &amp; Lyle, a consistent financial supporter of the Tory
party, has decided this year it will give a donation to Ashdown's lot, as
well as spooning out its usual Pounds 25,000 to the Tories.
The company is not commenting on the move but it is thought to be the idea
of Neil Shaw, Tate &amp; Lyle's iconoclastic chairman, in recent months a less
than vigorous advocate of Prime Minister John Major's leadership qualities.
It is particularly unusual for Ashdown's party to get cash from companies
outside a general election year. Not that the Lib Dems will be able to go on
a spree; Tate &amp; Lyle is donating less than Pounds 5,000.
Enough to sugar a few pills, nonetheless.

During the past 10 days, the world has glimpsed the possibility that the
Bosnian army will retake by force some of the territory which it has failed
to gain by diplomacy.
If the Bosnian government gains are sustained - and this is still in the
balance - that may possibly be one of the least bad developments in that
terrible situation.
Western leaders will no doubt deplore further death and destruction and
rightly condemn the Bosnian army if it violates UN safe havens. But having
recognised the Sarajevo authorities as the legitimate rulers of an
independent state, the world cannot, with any consistency, condemn the
Bosnian army for winning back some of the land taken from it.
The west may also hope that the latest battles will create a better chance
of a viable settlement than has existed since the Serbs seized control of
about 70 per cent of Bosnia.
Until recently, the Serbs had little incentive to negotiate a peace on terms
which others might consider reasonable; the Bosnian army's successes make
this somewhat more likely.
If peace negotiations should indeed result, the cautious strategy of the
five-nation contact group for bringing the parties together will prove to
have been partially vindicated.
If the west had intervened directly, either with its own air power or
conspicuous deliveries of big guns, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, would have come under stronger pressure to rescue the Bosnian
Serbs.
Although Mr Milosevic is widely blamed for starting the war, his decision to
isolate the Bosnian Serbs has contributed to the recent successes of their
enemies.
Even if a more even balance of forces can eventually bring the conflict to
an end, there is no ground for complacency. Worse horrors may be in store.
The United Nations forces in the region are trying to mitigate the effects
of the fighting on civilians by distributing aid and maintaining safe
havens.
The new fighting redoubles the moral imperative to demilitarise and protect
the six UN-designated safe areas, a task which should not be confused with
any ambition to influence the course of the war.
These efforts by the UN have been undermined by all the parties, including
the Bosnian government. The UN deserves support in facing down, by all means
at its disposal, any challenges to agreed peacekeeping arrangements
The outside world's moral influence over Bosnia's leaders is weak, given
that it failed to stop the atrocities by the Serbs.
However, if the Sarajevo authorities wish to retain the sympathy they have
gained among western nations, they must address two questions: will they
help their own civilians by co-operating more with the UN? And will they
show mercy to Serb civilians in their army's path?

FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Era's end in Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How Messers Boris Yeltsin and Victor Chernomyrdin must envy the Chinese
their annual rate of inflation of 27 per cent. Nevertheless, this rise in
Chinese prices is important, not just for its direct effects, but also for
what it reveals about the fissures within Chinese politics. With people
positioning themselves for life after Deng Xiaoping, these are unlikely to
be closed. This is the disturbing message from this year's FT survey of
China, published today.
Mr Deng's stroke of genius was to approach the collapsing state-socialist
economy just as invaders used to treat China's Great Wall. He went round it.
The results may not be quite as stellar as official figures suggest, but the
country has made more economic progress in a decade and a half than in
centuries. The government, albeit corrupt and dictatorial, has provided
reasonable political stability, while encouraging economic initiative. The
consequences have been astounding.
Big problems remain, however, partly because reform has been so carefully
circumscribed. As competition has become stronger, swathes of the old
economy are failing to compete. More than 40 per cent of the older state
enterprises, which still generate close to half of industrial output, are
making losses this year. Yet 1994 is far from a year of recession,
notwithstanding hitherto unsuccessful efforts to curb inflation. On the
contrary, the economy is expected to grow by 11 per cent.
Relations between Beijing and local government is the other big challenge to
reformers. As the economy has expanded, particularly along the coast,
Beijing has found it increasingly difficult either to obtain the revenue it
needs or to control spending, particularly on investment. Its solution has
been the printing press. Direct and indirect borrowing from the central bank
has been equal to about a third of total budgetary revenues in recent years.
In consequence, the ratio of broad money to national income has climbed to
over 100 per cent. This monetary time-bomb threatens grave economic and
political damage. China cannot afford a flight from money. What is needed is
a push for effective reform of the fiscal system, social welfare (still
largely provided by state enterprises), finance and the central bank itself.
Reformers know very well what is needed. But recently progress has become
decidedly slow.
So great is the release of energy in China that continued rapid economic
progress remains the most likely outcome. In the absence of Deng's
authority, however, bitter struggles for power are likely to emerge within
Beijing, between it and the provinces, and between competitive and less
competitive parts of the economy.
Outsiders are largely spectators. But they can encourage China to play a
responsible part in international arrangements. The country should, for
example, be helped into the new World Trade Organisation, in return for a
commitment to further liberalisation. In the longer term, only the emergence
of a prosperous middle-class in an open economy is likely to produce a China
with which the world can be comfortable.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Closer to the customers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank's huge branch network in Germany is undergoing one of the most
fundamental transformations since the bank was broken into regions after the
second world war. The slowly-growing competition for customers among German
banks has forced it to re-think how services are delivered.
Deutsche recognised the need to give customers at its 1,500 branches a more
personal and effective service - and thus have a better chance of keeping
them - in 1990. It started pushing authority down to local branch managers,
and away from its head and regional offices four years ago.
Not satisfied with the results, it is now trying to inject urgency into the
process and involve staff more closely, with the introduction of Projekt
Kundennahe (getting close to the customers). It involves visits to branches
by board members, and training for staff.
Mr Michael Endres, a member of the managing board, says it will boost the
confidence of the 55,000 domestic employees. 'This has to reinvigorate our
activities in Germany. There is also the question of motivation. The blows
we have received this year have had some repercussions on our people.'
Deutsche is keen to enhance links with the customer and strengthen a service
mentality for which Germany is not exactly famed.
The bank also plans to develop advisory skills. It wants staff to give
financial advice to customers, and persuade them to buy a wider range of
products. 'You have to find a way of opening up the bank more fully for the
client,' says Mr Hilmar Kopper, the chairman.
This is in line with efforts by banks in other European countries to sell
more products such as residential mortgage loans and life insurance to
customers. German customers have traditionally been as conservative as
banks, but they are beginning to shop around for better deals.
'Three or four years ago, banks found it hard to compete with one another
because customers were not price-sensitive, but there has been an
attitudinal change,' says Mr Chris Williams, analyst at the broker Fox-Pitt
Kelton. Banks now offer more products such as money market investment funds.
They are also starting to charge companies for products and services that
used to be included in lending margins before they were eroded. 'Banks are
beginning to re-think, and they will attach price tags to individual
services,' says Mr Hans-Peter Ferslev, head of Deutsche's strategy unit.
Deutsche has tried to remove administrative responsibilities from middle
managers, to give them more time to focus on lending and giving advice.
Paper processing is being taken out of branches and done in regional
centres, while personnel issues are being handled from head office.
The aim is not simply to increase income, but to reduce the number of poor
lending decisions. Mr Endres says the sharp rise in bad debt provisions on
lending to small- and medium-sized companies last year was partly because
managers had not devoted enough time to their customers.
'We saw in recent years, especially in our business with smaller and
medium-sized companies, that we didn't take enough care of our clients,'
says Mr Endres. He estimates that productivity (measured in profit per
employee) has risen by about 30 per cent since reforms started in 1990.
To reinforce the idea of personal responsibility, Deutsche has introduced
performance-related pay at the level of branch director, and wants to extend
it throughout the bank. 'Everybody can be drawn at his nose if something
goes wrong. He cannot say that it is someone else's fault,' says Mr Endres.
Deutsche has become a harsher place to work in other ways. Staff numbers
fell by 2,800 in the domestic bank last year, with many middle managers
taking early retirement. The impact of the changes in west Germany was
partly cushioned by Deutsche's expansion into branch banking in the east.
Mr Endres says that a change in attitudes is the most vital aspect of
reforms. 'It is not just a matter of drawing lines and boxes on a chart, it
is important that everyone knows that his role has changed,' he says.
As competition grows in German banking, this will become increasingly
apparent.

FT  07 NOV 94 / A hard act to follow: John Ridding asks whether France's
drive to privatise can sustain momentum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Renault, the motor group, enters the home straight on its journey to the
stock market, the French government is weighing the next steps in its
programme to dispose of much of the state's corporate assets.
Individual investors have until Thursday to confirm orders for shares in the
partial privatisation of Renault, but Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy
minister, is already plotting his next steps. He has lit the fuse for the
privatisation of Seita, the state tobacco monopoly, by launching the process
to select adviser banks for the sale.
Mr Alphandery has also emphasised that the insurance companies Assurances
Generales de France and the Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance are on the
auction block, and that industrial partners are being invited to invest in
Groupe Bull, the computer maker.
The preparations reflect the government's strategy of having several irons
in the fire. But they also demonstrate the need to maintain momentum in
France's ambitious privatisation drive. For 1995, the centre-right
administration of prime minister Edouard Balladur is banking on receipts of
FFr55bn (Pounds 6.5bn) from the sale of state assets, the same target as for
this year, and vital to its goal of cutting the budget deficit from FFr301bn
in 1994 to FFr275bn.
Maintaining such momentum could, however, prove tough. As the government
moves down the list of 21 public-sector groups it selected for sale on
taking office last year, the going may become more difficult.
Part of the reason is that the government has set itself a hard act to
follow. The first four privatisations - Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone
Poulenc, the chemicals group, Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, and the
insurer Union des Assurances de Paris - involved stars of the public sector.
Profitable, and familiar to investors through the existence of tradeable
securities, they slipped smoothly into the hands of private investors. The
combined receipts totalled FFr94.4bn, with Elf alone raising FFr34.9bn.
The flotation of Renault, another of the state's prize assets, is also
proceeding smoothly. Institutional investors have demanded 15 times as many
shares as they had been allocated. Industry observers expect sufficient
demand for the 60 per cent of the shares alloted to be sold to individual
investors.
It is after Renault, however, and the FFr8bn or so its flotation will bring
the state that the challenges become more complex. This is partly because
some of the next candidates for sale are in blighted market sectors and
partly because the sale of profitable public-sector companies leaves the
government with fewer large, attractive assets. Political sensitivities in
the run-up to next spring's presidential elections and the depression
looming over the stock market may further complicate the task.
Mr Alphandery is keen that Assurances Generales de France should be
dispatched as soon as possible and most industry analysts regard the insurer
as an attractive company. But like other insurers, AGF has been hit hard by
market conditions. Its shares have fallen by more than 35 per cent this
year, as the value of its bond portfolio has plunged with rising long-term
interest rates. CNP, the other insurance company on the block for partial
privatisation, has been similarly affected.
'The government is ready to launch both operations,' says one insurance
industry analyst, 'but it cannot be seen to be flogging off the state
silverware too cheaply.'
Such considerations are a factor in the decision to start work on Seita.
Like AGF and CNP, the tobacco monopoly is potentially attractive, achieving
net profits of FFr585m last year, against FFr447m in 1992.
But privatisation may prove politically sensitive, since Seita's Gitanes and
Gauloises brands are, for many, an important symbol of French culture. There
is also opposition among trade unions at the company, which have started to
mobilise against the sale.
Seita, like several other companies near the top of the privatisation list,
is a relatively small operation. Although the sale of AGF would bring more
than FFr15bn, the tobacco group is valued at about FFr7bn, more than the
expected receipts from the partial privatisation of CNP. Bull, still
reporting losses, is unlikely to bring significant income, despite the
FFr11bn in subsidies it has been granted over the past two years.
The problem facing the government is that big does not mean beautiful.
State-owned giants such as Air France and Credit Lyonnais are incurring big
losses and undergoing radical recovery programmes that must be completed
before they can be sold.
There are several attractive large companies on the privatisation list.
These include Thomson, the electronics group, Usinor Sacilor, the steel
company, and Pechiney, the aluminium and packaging concern.
But each has its complications. Thomson may merge its defence and consumer
electronics activities before sale. Usinor Sacilor, although back in the
black after losses of FFr5.7bn last year, must reduce its debt burden of
FFr20bn. Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, who took over as chairman at Pechiney in
July, believes the need to return the group to profit and reduce borrowings
suggests privatisation in 1996, rather than next year.
If many of the privatisation candidates are not yet in a state of readiness,
neither is the market. It is not just the insurance sector which has been
hit this year. The CAC-40 index of leading shares has fallen by 19 per cent
since its February peak, depressing the value of privatisation issues. With
the exception of BNP, all the privatisation issues are trading below their
issue price.
'Investors may have been disappointed,' says a broker at one French
securities house. 'Renault should see strong demand, but less familiar and
less profitable companies may experience a more cautious approach from the
public.'
Caution may be compounded by the increased competition for the savings of
the French public. Last month, for example, the government launched a scheme
to sell 10-year government bonds direct to the public: with a yield of about
7.5 per cent they are proving an attractive investment.
Despite the array of challenges, the French government is sanguine. 'The
success so far augurs well for the next stages,' says one official. He cites
strong demand from institutional investors, and says that industrial
partners have also shown a healthy appetite for privatisations. The planned
investment in Renault by Lagardere group, the defence and communications
company that helped develop the Renault Espace car, is one example.
Officials play down talk of disenchantment among retail investors.
'Privatisation shares have fallen by less than the market as a whole, and
investors are aware of the potential upswing,' says an aide at the economy
ministry.
At the industry ministry, the message is that the restructuring programmes
necessary to prepare the next batch of privatisation candidates will bear
fruit. 'If you look at Renault, not so long ago it was a sick man of the
public sector. It is possible to get the loss-makers into shape and it will
be helped by the strong revival in the domestic economy.'
Such an assessment is supported by industry observers. 'They have the
assets, and the political sensitivity of some of the sales will matter less
after next spring's presidential elections,' says one merchant banker.
One option is to sell a second tranche of shares in Renault, reducing the
state's holding to below 50 per cent. Mr Alphandery has dismissed such a
scenario. 'We have no plans for a second operation,' he says, reflecting
official sensitivity concerning the company, a former stronghold of union
power. But Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, hinted at the
possibility last week that the flotation represented a step rather than an
end in his company's privatisation process.
Should individual investors demonstrate the same appetite for Renault as
their institutional counterparts, Mr Schweitzer's state shareholder may come
to agree. As one Paris banker puts it: 'If other issues are proving tricky,
then a further sale of Renault shares could prove an enticing way of easing
a budgetary bind.'

Sir, Whether or not it is desirable to reduce capital expenditure on roads,
I think that very few would argue for a reduction in capital expenditure on
transport, as suggested in your report, 'Roads budget faces cut of Pounds
400m' (October 3). Any reduction in the roads budget should be complemented
by an increase in expenditure on public transport. While the government
would like much of that investment to come from the private sector, it is
quite clear from the limited progress of the private finance initiative that
the use of public funds is unavoidable.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government must play part to achieve
endogenous growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT J SHAPIRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I follow with interest your discussion of the endogenous sources of
national growth. In truth, much of the disagreement seems to concern the
political preferences of Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and
others, to which the economics of the matter are largely indifferent.
What can be said with certainty is that national growth rates are affected
not only by the capacity of companies and workers to enhance their
efficiency, but also by their capacities for innovation. In this regard,
innovation refers not simply to the development of new physical
technologies, but virtually every aspect of the economic process, from
identifying or locating new materials, sources of labour or means of
financing and marketing, to reorganising jobs and work places. Endogenous
growth policy involves all factors which contribute to such variegated
innovation, as well as to efficiency.
This view will not reassure political promoters on the hard left or the hard
right. Higher efficiency requires greater investment, which in turn requires
capital-encouraging policies. That includes what should seem obvious - sound
monetary policy, enhanced access to capital, especially for smaller
companies, and cyclical fiscal discipline - but not, as many might like it,
lower marginal tax rates on the returns from certain capital (which evidence
indicates has little affect on the aggregate net store of capital).
It also involves an enhanced commitment to enlarging the supply of public
capital. Professor Robert Barro says as much (Personal View, November 1)
when he notes the importance of improving the skills and health of the
workforce and the quality of the infrastructure (which, properly chosen,
produce returns higher than those from private investment). Also, add to
that the store of basic research.
These functions cannot be 'privatised' without sacrificing an increment of
growth. Put another way, government's role in national growth is substantial
 -an investor, not director - for an advanced economy cannot for long raise
its underlying growth rate without vigorous public (and private) investment.
Your correspondents are not wrong in suggesting that competition also
matters to national growth rates, because (like political parties) companies
and workers innovate only when competition forces them to. Regulation which
impedes competition - for example, laws and rules insulating banks or
telecommunications companies from certain sources of competition - makes no
sense in a growth programme. This should not be confused with ideological
demands to roll back other forms of regulation, such as health or safety
protections, which serve social policy ends and pose no threat to the
competition that drives innovation.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Personal View: Compelling case for monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KARL LAMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic and monetary union is the central part of the project for European
unification. For a country to transfer power over its currency to an
independent European central bank represents a most far-reaching form of
European integration, not least because the central bank's decisions would
affect governmental decisions in many other fields of economic and social
policy.
The European states linked by monetary union will need to show solidarity in
many other spheres. If they were to drift apart on fundamental questions of
foreign and security policy, for example, it would jeopardise the consensus
needed in the economic field.
Once the fundamental link between monetary and political union is
recognised, three important assertions can be made. First, European Union
members that form the 'core' of monetary union will also be, for the
foreseeable future, at the core of political union.
Second, any country that opposes monetary union can also be held to oppose
political union, and vice versa. Third, any country that comes out against
either of these goals clearly has no interest in the success of the 1996
intergovernmental conference to review progress since the Maastricht treaty.
This conference will be important for trying to bring about further
improvements in plans for political union, matching the agreements on
monetary union made at Maastricht in 1991.
No one can be in any doubt that monetary union is necessary. The D-Mark
occupies what some feel to be a dominant position in Europe. As a result,
the existing European Monetary System, which is in essence a German one,
cannot be a permanent solution for Europe's monetary arrangements. In the
long run, it is unacceptable for other member states to have to acquiesce in
monetary decisions made by the Bundesbank.
A recent discussion paper from the Christian Democratic Union/Christian
Social Union parliamentary group in Bonn attracted controversy because it
postulated the likelihood of a core group emerging in the EU comprising
those member states ready for monetary union. In reality, however, this
statement contained nothing that was new.
Not all 12 members of the EU will be able to take part in European monetary
union (Emu) in 1997, or even after 1999, because they will not meet the
convergence criteria for Emu set down in the Maastricht treaty. This has
already been tacitly acknowledged in recent budgetary projections by Spain
and Portugal, at least as far as 1997 is concerned.
After the publication of the CDU/CSU paper, some observers in Britain voiced
their hope that France would not join an Emu core group that included
Germany but not other larger EU member states. Some people in Britain even
appear to think that this could cause the Emu project to fail - perhaps for
good. Such an argument flies in the face of reality, however.
Even if monetary union were limited at first to a small core, each
non-German member would be in a better position than today, since decisions
would be taken not by the Bundesbank but jointly by a European central bank.
Any country that meets the convergence criteria, therefore, has an interest
in taking part in Emu as soon as practicable.
Countries that deliberately chose not to take part in such a union would be
in a difficult position. If the D-Mark is held to be dominant today, how
much more would this apply to a future European currency in a monetary union
comprising perhaps eight or 10 present and future member states?
Countries outside Emu would have no say in the decisions of the European
central bank. This would be a serious handicap to a country such as Britain
which has Europe's largest financial market.
There are other reasons, too, why Germany is interested in monetary union.
Germany is no longer capable of, or interested in, exercising some form of
European hegemony. Its strength vis-a-vis its European partners - in
economic, political or military terms - is not comparable with that of the
US vis-a-vis its partners in the Bretton Woods system or Nato after the
second world war.
The overwhelming desire of the German political establishment is to invest
the country's strength in the construction of Europe. That fact has not been
changed by the result of the German general elections, even though
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's majority in the Bundestag has fallen.
If, however, efforts to establish monetary union were to fail, the process
of political integration would also come to a halt, at least for the time
being. This would have disastrous consequences - not simply for Germany but
also, directly or indirectly, for all other EU states.
We Germans, facing various temptations and pressures to adopt a
'go-it-alone' policy towards eastern Europe, see - due to the catastrophe of
1945 perhaps a little bit clearer than other European states - the need to
learn the lessons of history. Yet the Europe of the future cannot and must
not be built simply on the lessons of the past. The imperatives of the
present are equally compelling, and these call for common European
institutions.
The nation states of Europe must face the reality that they are no longer
capable of mastering by ourselves all their external challenges. Those who
cling to national sovereignty are seeking solace in an empty shell. In
trying to escape from Europe, they are seeking to escape reality. And this
is an endeavour which, as everyone knows, is doomed to failure.
The author is foreign policy spokesman of the Christian Democratic
Union/Christian Social Union parliamentary group in Bonn.

<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your editorial, 'White House and Casablanca'
(October 31), regarding the Middle East/North Africa economic summit. I was
present at the summit in Casablanca and agree whole-heartedly with the
thrust of your comments on the difficulty of creating a large regional
structure when there is not a consensus of opinion among the key
participants.
Political solutions are insufficient. Grandiose development plans will take
too long. In a just and perpetual peace, the powers have to ensure there is
individual economic opportunities at the grassroots level of society. This
need is most acute in the West Bank and Gaza.
Palestinians need capital to develop their own small businesses and create
jobs. The most effective vehicle I have seen in this regard has been the
Enterprise Fund the US government set up to help eastern Europe's
transformation. That is why I presented a proposal for a Palestinian
Enterprise Fund to the leaders attending the economic summit.
This concept can be put in place quickly and contribute to the stability
essential for the region to attract the larger investments that will cement
regional relations.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pension failing was inability to show
what member would receive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J P BATTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr M A Bentley (Letters, November 2) seems to have an interestingly
topsy-turvy view about company pension schemes. It is true that one of the
merits of a money-purchase scheme is that it clearly shows each member's
'savings'. Equally, its greatest failing is its inability to show what a
member can expect to receive at retirement. It was this shortcoming which
was put to such good use by some personal pensions salesmen who were able to
hoodwink huge numbers of employees with wildly unreasonable predictions. If
personal pensions had been required to show a proper estimate of what a
member was likely to receive at retirement then I would agree that, in Mr
Bentley's own words, 'most employees would never have spared a moment to
consider personal pension plans'.
To try to drag employers and occupational pension schemes into this
depressing, but predictable, saga with mis-sold personal pensions is quite
unfair. Many employers, and their associations, made strong criticisms about
personal pensions at the time they were introduced. These criticisms were
cheerfully dismissed as being nothing more than vested interest. Had the
proponents of personal pensions been recognised at the time for the vested
interests that they really were, the position of many disappointed personal
pension policy holders would now be quite different.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Airport tax rates are illogical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D J MCKAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I draw your attention to another problem with the newly-introduced
airport tax ('Airlines hit at levy on departures', October 31).
In addition to the confusion over European rates there is the problem of
double levying where passengers wish to make use of the fact that London has
five airports. Rates for London-Geneva-London are Pounds 5 when travelling
in and out of the same airport, but Pounds 10 when flying from Heathrow and
returning to Gatwick, or any other combination.
Where is the logic in this?

FT  07 NOV 94 / Arts: Dillane gets to the heartbeat of Hall's Hamlet -
Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not only is Stephen Dillane's Hamlet the freshest, most interesting, and
most peculiar ingredient of Peter Hall's new staging of Hamlet, he is also
the most modern. The production is curious in containing several dissimilar
acting styles, and Dillane's performance makes most of the other key
characters - Claudius, Gertrude, Ophelia, Polonius - seem somewhat
artificial. We, watching, may not feel that we are in their world, yet we
never doubt we are in his. His performance is close to the one he gave as
Prior, the Aids patient in Angels in America, and yet here it is far from
unstylish. He is alienated from the court about him, but with no Romantic
beauty about his alienation. He is ironic, self-critical, witty, passive,
but incisive.
I have never heard a Hamlet less concerned with vocal beauty or technique.
Fascinating to be hearing him alongside Michael Pennington, who here plays
both Claudius and Ghost, and who, 14 years ago, was an exceptionally
intelligent Hamlet whose gorgeous vocal virtuosity was geared to showing the
vast range of Hamlet's thought. Dillane is altogether smaller-scale, less
energetic, less varied, but immensely more spontaneous. Very simply, he uses
the rhythm of the verse to reveal its heartbeat. The most important thing
about him is that we hang easily on his every word. And yet the most
striking oddity about him is his voice - dry, unlovely. The dryness is
itself expressive; it tells us of Hamlet's detached, sardonic, attitude.
And the voice is the man. This is a hand-on-hip Hamlet, who shrugs, and
rolls his eyes in disbelief. (The latter is overdone.) We see the deliberate
lack of manly assertiveness, and we see how absurd he often finds his
society. Though it helps Hamlet if Hamlet is more visibly a prince, and more
evidently capable of virile ardour, these limitations scarcely troubled me
while I was in the theatre.
I did miss the bounding scale of Hamlet's thought; Dillane's Hamlet is
scarcely a philosopher at all. As for his wit, I wanted yet more; the energy
of Hamlet's mind should coruscate. But everything Dillane does is
spontaneous. When it comes to self, and family, and court, he reveals,
wonderfully, many things in Hamlet - not least his self-loathing. Then,
towards the end, he finds the right inner calm.
This Hamlet is not, however, the best vehicle for this Hamlet. Lucy Hall has
designed an attractive cyclorama of sea and clouds (and we hear the thumping
waves and whistling wind), while the centre of the stage is a forward-tilted
grey circle. All that, obviously, is Nature, and is meant to clash with the
court - for which long-stranded red curtains descend, and red furniture is
brought on. But the court is distractingly vulgar. And there is pointless,
dull muzak.
In theory, I like the way that the presence of Pennington and Donald Sinden
(Polonius) supplied the production with an immense wealth of Shakespearian
experience. Some of their lines have marvellous force, such as Claudius's
first fierce stab of guilt, 'How smart a lash that speech doth give my
conscience],' and Polonius's 'I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal
the soul Lends the tongue vows ..'
Everything Pennington does is intelligent; and Sinden gives an interestingly
punitive edge to his scenes with Ophelia. But there is too much contrivance
about most of Pennington's utterance; and Sinden's standard vocal tricks -
especially the prolonged vowels and final consonants - remind us of his
canny old actorliness, at the expense of Polonius to us.
Ophelia is probably the most impossible role in Shakespeare, and Gina
Bellman is not the first to have been tripped over by it.
Yes, she is pretty; yes, she has presence. But, in her effort to show us the
perplexed suffering and repression of Ophelia's early scenes, she already
seems precious and insincere. That her mad scenes (menstrual blood staining
her dress, spastic gestures, pigeon-toed mock-ballet steps) are all artifice
is scarcely surprising. Gwen Taylor's Gertrude, brightly superficial at
first, gets better, as events force her to grow more honest; but with no
especial depth.
Although this production has been touring Britain for months, it feels
under-prepared. I never believed that Polonius, Laertes (Tom Beard), and
Ophelia were one family; or that Gertrude and Claudius could have slept
together; or that Hamlet and Ophelia had been in love; or that this Gertrude
and Hamlet were mother and son.
A further problem is that the Gielgud Theatre (formerly the Globe) does not
have the kind of comfortable seating to help us through a play as long as
Hamlet. (How ironic; the names Gielgud and Hamlet should go together like
bread and butter.) The production lasts considerably longer than four hours.
A second interval would help, but a more integrated production would help
much better.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Arts: The siege of the Barbican - The plight of Detta
O'Cathain as she retreats into her bunker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you arrive late, or leave early, from a concert or a play at the Barbican
Centre in the City of London, you may well see a lone female figure
surveying the empty foyers, checking out the bars, the cafes and the
toilets, like a cross between a ghost and a night manager. It is Baroness
Detta O'Cathain, the director of the centre, whose future, under intense
speculation for two years now, seems increasingly parlous.
Last week the centre started a search for a deputy director, but not just
any old deputy. This new appointee will also be responsible for artistic
programming and eventually will replace the Lady herself. It puts the
Baroness in a virtually impossible position and she is resigned to not
seeing out the remaining three years of her contract. 'I'm not going to walk
out. Whether I will be here in a year's time I do not know. If the ideal
person came in and bedded down rapidly it could be a matter of months'.
O'Cathain's plight is the inevitable consequence of a culture clash. She
arrived in 1990 to lick the Barbican into financial shape. Under her
predecessor, Henry Wrong, it had been a happy, easy going place, where the
bottom line lost out in the battle for artistic excellence. A committed
Thatcherite, O'Cathain had the backing of the City Fathers, who bail out the
Barbican with Pounds 13.5m a year in subsidy, to knock heads together.
She has succeeded only too well. 'I have always stayed within budget' she
boasts. But there has been more blood around the place that at the end of
Hamlet. Around 50 of the 220 staff have left, and relations with those
remaining, worried about their jobs and the centre's future, are not good.
The situation has deteriorated rapidly since the summer when O'Cathain
sacked her artistic director, Kenneth Richardson, a few months after
appointing him.
This has forced her to take a more active role in programming at the
Barbican Hall, with some unhappy consequences. A series of three concerts
designed to introduce a new audience to classical music attracted
attendances of less than 30 per cent and lost money. Instead of the centre
promoting just over 20 performances a year at the hall, with outside
producers like Raymond Gubbay filling the gaps and taking the risk, it has
had to find shows for almost 100 nights, a daunting task at a time when
concert attendances around the country have fallen sharply.
So strong had the murmurings become in recent weeks that Geoffrey Lawson,
chairman of the Barbican Centre committee, and a firm champion of Detta
O'Cathain, was forced to investigate. He asked the heads of the main users
of the Barbican - Adrian Noble of the RSC, Clive Gillinson of the LSO,
Raymond Gubbay, and the Guildhall School of Music  - for their views.
They were not encouraging about O'Cathain's prospects. They spoke of a lack
of direction in the Barbican, shortcomings in artistic vision and a lack of
motivation and support among staff. There was also concern about the
Baroness's part-time directorships and her involvement in the House of
Lords. Lawson had no alternative but to launch the sudden hunt for a
deputy-come-replacement. He has also reassured the staff by saying there
will be no more job losses - a public indication that, for the first time,
O'Cathain has lost the backing of the City.
It is not surprising that she feels hard done by and has retreated into her
bunker. She has discovered the tough way that practitioners in the arts are
sensitive and self-regarding and have an exaggerated opinion of their
creative contribution. In her world, the balance sheet rules; in theirs, it
is the emotional experience.
She was brought in to administer the centre - to improve the catering
facilities, to make the place more agreeable to visitors, to raise its
reputation and bring in sponsors - but she just could not keep her hands off
the artistic planning when she discovered that at certain concerts each of
the few attenders was being subsidised at the rate of Pounds 54 a head.
Such interference has contributed to her current plight. In many ways the
Barbican is a more attractive venue. Little can be done about its brutalist
exterior and depressing approaches, but inside the ambiance, the catering
and the free foyer entertainment make it quite jolly.
O'Cathain laboured hard to improve the acoustic in the Barbican Hall. She
has helped to attract millions in sponsorship - at last week's opening of
the ambitious Everybody's Shakespeare Festival she could claim some credit
for the Pounds 700,000 raised - and there are few corporate receptions at
the centre where she is not on hand, pressing the flesh.
But she had not been prepared to soften her abrasive style, to answer the
criticisms that she came to the Barbican from the Milk Marketing Board
knowing little about the arts and convinced that they could be managed and
marketed like any other product. Her attempts to influence the artistic
programming have not been successful, and, without an artistic director, the
Barbican faces many dark nights and few major eye catching festivals.
Ironically, it has worked against her that her two main tenants, the RSC and
the LSO, are currently enjoying artistic and financial highs. Both had their
problems settling in to the Barbican, but now they are happy and successful
they expect the same from their landlady. It matters to them that their
mutual home is populated by relaxed staff and contented visitors. An ill
attended concert at the Barbican Hall rubs off on the theatre. In the old
days the different audiences mingled together, sniffing out future treats in
other parts of the centre. The tenants now think they are carrying the
Barbican and want a better service.
The Barbican Centre was a child of post-war planning. It took decades to
complete and by thetime it opened in 1982 the worldhad moved on. It was
anticipated that commercial rentals from the adjacent exhibition centre
andfrom the hall would pay for the arts programme. It was a pious hope.
Little has worked out as projected and Mammon and culture have been forced
into a difficult marriage.
When the arts flourished, and there were plenty of successful bookings for
the hall, all the parties could live in reasonable harmony. The anomalous
position of the centre's director, who was mainly responsible for
run-of-the-mill support services but who also had to master mind an artistic
programme alongside the work of the RSC and the LSO, was skated over. When
times were harder, and money talked more loudly, there were bound to be
rows.
O'Cathain will not be the first business person to come unstuck when mixing
it with the arts. Having badly wounded their prey they now hope for a quick
kill. The feeling is that the Barbican will not attract the first class
artistic (and tyro business) manager it needs if there is uncertainty about
the future of the boss. Detta O'Cathain's fate seems to mirror uncannily
that of the former prime minister whose views she so admired.

BBC2 begins another adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit (the last was in 1964)
and already we know that two things are going to be missing. First Miriam
Margolyes, whose one-woman Dickens show proved that she was born to play Mrs
Gamp, has not been cast in the role. The part has been given to Elizabeth
Spriggs, a great actress but not even the right shape. Second, it has been
decided to cut the American section altogether and consequently Dickens'
famous attack on the conceit and hypocrisy of 19th century American society.
Of course that still leaves enough narrative for umpteen television series,
but it does make you wonder about what political correctness is doing to the
BBC2 (9.00). Earlier the same network considers the way in which man-made
noise is threatening the survival of whales. Horizon explains how noise can
interfere with the whales' use of sonar for hunting and finding mates
(8.00). The current affairs series investigate how we spend our taxes:
Cutting Edge on disturbed youngsters (9.00 C4); and Panorama on the elderly
(9.30 BBC1).

FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Ohga collects another award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norio Ohga, 63, the colourful president and chief executive of Sony, is
about to collect another award - and this time not for his piano playing,
writes William Dawkins.
George Washington University has named him as its first international chief
executive of the year. The fact that Ohga's talents are not just limited to
business is an 'inspiration to business leaders around the world', says
David Fowler, the dean.
Ohga learnt to play the piano at the age of seven, studied music in Munich
and Berlin, and had started a career as an opera singer when he was spotted
by Akio Morita, Sony's founder. Since then, the baritone has provided the
cultural and design input.
Ohga is well known in US business circles, having taken a big part in Sony's
negotiations to buy CBS Records for Dollars 2bn in 1987 and Columbia
Pictures for Dollars 3.4bn in 1989 - the biggest foreign acquisition by a
Japanese company.
This realised the dream of Ohga and Morita to add software - films and music
 -to a consumer electronics hardware making business.
That dream has become something of a headache during the recession, but
Sony, under Ohga, is sticking to the strategy. The recession certainly has
not dented his taste for the grand gesture, as shown when he appeared in New
York last year to conduct the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra before a capacity
audience. He will content himself in Washington next Friday with giving a
speech at the award ceremony.

FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Dejouany lines up successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When French companies skip a generation, they often do it in style, writes
Andrew Jack. Jean-Marie Messier, the heir apparent at Generale des Eaux, is
almost exactly half the age of the incumbent.
Guy Dejouany, chairman of the enormous French utilities and communications
group which reported first half profits last month of FFr 1.26bn, is now 73
and has finally decided it is time to make plans for succession.
Messier, a partner at Lazard Freres, the merchant bank, at 37 has
considerable experience in his portfolio already.
It seems that Dejouany has made the selection personally, although it has
yet to be ratified. If all goes to plan, Messier will join the board soon
after, probably in a role such as director general.
Company sources suggest that Dejouany is not expected to retire for some
time - perhaps not until 1996 - and will retain considerable power as
'president'. Dejouany's reputation is of an extraordinarily hard worker. He
recently said to a friend: 'I must be getting old. I sometimes find that
after 11 pm I get tired reading documents.'
Born in Grenoble, Messier graduated from two of the most important schools -
the Ecole Polytechniqe and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - before
becoming a member of the highly respected Inspecteurs des Finances.
He was an adviser on prime minister Edouard Balladur's privatisation
programme, became a partner at Lazard Freres aged 32, and in the past few
months has built up a strong link with Generale des Eaux as its investment
banker.

FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Sons bring Ziff back to zero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Bill Ziff's retirement earlier this year, Wired, the trendy San Francisco
magazine, described him as 'the most powerful unknown publisher in America,
but arguably the most powerful man in computing', writes Louise Kehoe.
Just a few weeks later, Ziff's high-tech publishing empire was put on the
block by his three sons, who announced that they had no interest in
following their father's footsteps but would instead form an investment
firm.
Over the past few days the wishes of the Ziffs junior have been fulfilled.
Most of the assets of Ziff Communications have been sold off in three
parcels for about Dollars 2bn.
The sales mark the end of a decade in which the name Ziff has become
synonymous with influence in the personal computer industry. When Ziff
publications praised a new product, it was a sure fire success. When they
panned it, it was all but dead.
The success of Ziff's publishing business is all the more remarkable because
it was built from the scraps of a much broader publishing group that
included magazines about cars, hi-fi and many other special interests.
In 1982, Bill Ziff was diagnosed as having terminal cancer. He sold off most
of the assets of the business, founded by his father, that he had built up
over the previous 29 years for Dollars 712.5m. But buyers showed little
interest in the company's fledgling computer magazines.
Despite his doctors' negative prognoses, Bill Ziff recovered his health and
built the remnants of his family business into a new publishing empire
focused on the computer industry.
The Ziff family is 'delighted' by the terms of the sale of its businesses,
Dirk Ziff, the oldest of the sons said last week. It is hard to imagine,
however, that Bill Ziff does not regret his sons' decision not to carry on
the publishing dynasty.

FT  07 NOV 94 / People: The Dalgety director who took an early bath - Jack
Rowell stepped down from the board in order to transfer his winning streak
to England's rugby team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Karine - is that how you pronounce it? Lovely name,' Jack Rowell said to the
waitress. He is a man who knows a bit about motivation. Needless to say,
service at lunch was excellent.
Last night, Rowell got together with a more robust cast of characters: the
21 members of the England rugby union squad. Their first international game
with Rowell as manager and coach is against Romania on Saturday. Only 15
will take to the Twickenham pitch, selected and motivated in Rowell's
inimitable style.
Charm, inspiration, pugnacity and fear are a few of the words that pepper
comments about this very tall and imposing man from colleagues both on the
rugby pitch and around the boardroom table.
In business, his reward for saving Golden Wonder Crisps carried him to the
board of Dalgety. The snack foods manufacturer, bought from Hanson in 1986,
was 'run down', according to Dalgety, which put in Rowell as chief
executive. In sport, success in making Bath the best British - perhaps
European - club team has landed him the England job.
'Business and sport have been mutually dependent for me,' Rowell says.
'Winning at sport gives you a lot of confidence that rubs off in business,
but sport also washes the mind of pressures so you come back to business
refreshed.'
Business had come first and rugby was a hobby. But Rowell has reversed his
priorities for England. He has stepped down at Dalgety to work on projects
he can fit around rugby, and picked up a couple of non-executive
directorships to keep his hand in.
'My wife Susan said to me: 'After the Alpine peaks of (club) rugby, you have
to try the Himalayas'.' Fifty-eight last Tuesday, he looks to this as 'the
pinnacle of my rugby career'.
Rowell's arrival as manager was less dramatic than his arrival at Golden
Wonder. Dalgety was struggling to make good its acquisition and worse, the
factory burnt down shortly after he joined. 'The company literally rose from
the ashes,' says one analyst.
Taking on England presents different challenges as the team prepares for
next year's World Cup in South Africa. 'We have to develop a more flexible
way of scoring tries,' says Rowell.
His appointment as manager last spring was greeted warmly because of his
team-building skills and deep knowledge and love of the game. Some former
players, though, have wondered out loud whether his use of fear and love of
making players compete for places on the pitch would work among the egos at
international level.
Two small squalls have blown up already: one was with the coach Dick Best
who, after this summer's tour of South Africa, was relieved of his job which
Rowell took on additionally; he also tried to insist that his squad members
be excused their club games last Saturday to leave them fresher for the
international. He backed down but nobody believes he will drop it.
'He's won most times,' says Maurice Warren, Dalgety's chairman and a veteran
of such encounters after 15 years as Rowell's boss. Rowell is one of the
most inspirational and effective managers he has met, and a delight to work
with. But he is very obstinate and often unforthcoming, says Warren.
'It's very difficult to get to the bottom of what he's thinking, what he's
planning. It is also hard to get him to understand when changes are
required,' says Warren.
'I had to pick my moments to have my rows with him. The best way was to sit
him down at a hotel or other public place.' Having lots of passers-by helped
restrain Rowell.
A rumbustious personality was evident from the outset of his career when he
arrived as a trainee accountant at a Middlesbrough practice in the 1960s.
'His riotous sense of humour and keen intellect enlivened the place,' says
John Precious, then a fellow trainee, now chairman of Celsis International,
the biotech company Rowell recently joined as a non-executive.
Working later for Procter &amp; Gamble in the north-east, Rowell resumed a rugby
career cut short at Oxford University by a serious injury. He played for
Gosforth, then took over as coach. 'I learnt more about managing than ever
before. I had to be a credible leader of England players on the team.'
A job change took him to Bristol - and Bath's rugby club was conveniently
close by. Both endeavours draw on common ingredients for success, he says:
physical and mental fitness, skills and team building. He looks for people
who are 'competitive, sparky, self-motivated individuals'. He believes in
giving the individual the confidence and tools 'to exercise their skills and
judgment in the heat of battle'.
The personal touch is key to Rowell's technique. In the changing room before
a match he is known for going to each player in turn - praising,
brow-beating, encouraging or cajoling as he sees fit. Performance is
everything, but if a player is dropped from the team, Rowell will work with
him to rebuild his confidence.
He sets 'stretch targets', believing that people can constantly give 15 per
cent more effort than they think possible. 'For human nature reasons, you
also need internal competition. I'm a great believer in peer pressure and
approval, but in an open environment where people can say you're letting the
team down.' Above all, there is the will to win. 'Business generally
neglects the psychology of winning.'
A flash of temper is among his tricks, too. 'Sometimes you have to be
bloody-minded to sort things out. It releases your own tension and helps you
make your point.'
Once his team takes to the field, he lets them get on with the job. During
matches at Bath he was known for pacing around the ground, always watching,
always analysing. Twickenham's soaring stands may constrain his style. But
every England player on the pitch will live in hope or fear of Rowell's
praise or criticism.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Japanese take a walk on the wide side - The
new TV format that has taken the industry by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the hottest items on the shopping list of any self-respecting Tokyo
techno-buff is a television set which would seem more at home in the
spacious lounges of 1950s Las Vegas than the ascetic apartments of 1990s
Omote-Sando - a wide-screen.
Wide-screens are conventional TV sets with unusually wide screens: designed
in the same proportions as those in cinemas. They might look like throwbacks
to the 1950s, but they have taken the Japanese market by storm since their
launch two years ago.
One in five TVs bought in Japan this year will be wide-screens, according to
the Electrical Industry Association. By the end of the century they will be
in nearly every Japanese home. The wide-screen is now making its debut in
Europe to coincide with the introduction of new-generation TVs made to the
Pal-Plus standard that significantly improves picture quality.
Nokia has already launched the first wide-screen Pal-Plus set, and Sony,
Philips and Grundig are about to follow, in the hope that Europeans will
embrace wide-screen as their format for the late 1990s.
The speed with which wide-screen has taken off in Japan came as a surprise,
not least to the consumer electronics industry. The first wide-screen sets
were introduced three years ago, but were seen by Sony, Sanyo, Matsushita,
Sharp and other leading manufacturers as little more than an interesting
alternative to the popular big-screen sets that might attract a cult market
of film buffs.
After all, there is nothing special about the technology behind the
wide-screens now on sale in Japan. They function like ordinary TVs but will,
eventually, be able to relay higher-quality images for broadcast programmes
when Japan's new Extended Definition Television (EDTV) service starts next
year. In the meantime, the only real advantage for viewers is that, thanks
to the wide-screen's special 16:9 dimensions, they can watch movies on video
in their original cinematic scale, rather than the cramped version usually
used on TV.
To the innovation-obsessed Japanese electronics industry, wide-screen seemed
far less interesting than a more elaborate and expensive development that
came to the market at about the same time: high-definition TV, or HDTV. The
industry confidently expected that HDTV would create a lucrative new market
by becoming the TV format for the 21st century.
In technology terms, HDTV is far superior to wide-screen. However, its
development has been dogged by regulatory rows, pricing problems and
software shortages. The regulators have yet to decide when it will be
launched in the US or Europe. At present it is available only in Japan.
The industry, anxious to exploit its exciting new technology, rushed HDTV on
to the Japanese market in the early 1990s. Sales have been disappointing.
Only 10,000 systems were sold in 1992 and the same number in 1993, according
to the EIA. Things have picked up this year, but sales are only expected to
total 30,000. This reflects efforts to reduce prices. Matsushita's Panasonic
subsidiary has slashed the cost of its HDTV systems from Y2.5m (Dollars
25,500) to Y550,000 - still more expensive than conventional TVs, given that
a standard Panasonic 21-inch set costs Y130,000.
But the main problem for HDTV is dearth of programming. At present it is
restricted to 10 hours of test broadcasts a day. This is not expected to
improve significantly until Japan's new HDTV service is introduced in 1997.
Most manufacturers are resigned to waiting until then to try to recoup their
investment. Some, such as Sanyo, are redirecting their efforts away from the
consumer market to selling HDTV as an educational and promotional medium to
museums and companies.
Meanwhile, wide-screen, originally treated as HDTV's poor relation, has
prospered. And there is no shortage of software. For years there has been a
cult market among Japanese film-buffs for 16:9 video versions of particular
movies, notably Ridley Scott's Bladerunner. Most video stores now stock
films in standard and wide-screen format, enabling consumers to get the full
benefit of wide-screen when watching movies on video. The market should
receive another boost with the launch of EDTV next year, enabling
broadcasters to be more inventive with programmes, particularly when filming
sport.
The number of wide-screens sold in Japan has risen rapidly from 60,000 sets
in 1992 to 300,000 last year and to an estimated 1.5m this year. The EIA
forecasts continued growth for the rest of the 1990s, with wide-screen
becoming Japan's dominant format by 2000.
The industry is now waiting to see whether wide-screen catches on in Europe,
where HDTV's prospects are still clouded. Earlier this year Sony introduced
two wide-screen sets to the European market. Both use the old Pal format,
rather than Pal-Plus, yet Sony says sales are well ahead of initial targets,
auguring well for the launch of its first Pal-Plus sets in January.
'We see wide-screen as the next big step forward for the European television
market,' says Sony Europe. 'But we're also realistic. It's very unusual for
a new product to sell as quickly anywhere else as it does in Japan.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Architecture: Mausoleum mountain - Colin Amery discusses
whether the Getty Center makes sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looks like the ruins of the Potala Palace in Tibet. The huge bulk of its
soaring solid walls rising out of the rocky hill-top dominates the view from
the San Diego freeway. This is Los Angeles, and what looks like a giant
film-set for a major historical movie turns out to be the still-unfinished
Getty Center.
What is slowly growing beneath the cranes is a college of culture - a series
of buildings around courtyards where the most arcane aspects of the visual
and decorative arts will be studied.
When he won the competition to design the centre in 1984, Richard Meier, a
New York architect, described it as 'the architectural commission of the
century'. Many people in the art world and in Los Angeles are now wondering
whether it will ever be completed.
Today, the estimated final construction cost is not far short of Dollars
750m. The plans show some 1.6m sq ft of buildings, a figure which was
quadrupled during the long planning period.
Why has it taken so long, and why did the Getty Trust decide to build what
is a new university with a museum in it?
It looks as though 10 years of wearying debate between the academic factions
at the Getty have been the major reason for the slow progress of the
project. The choice of site - 600 acres of hilly terrain in Brentwood, in
West Los Angeles - has necessitated massive excavation and also complex
negotiations with the neighbours, who are concerned about the arrival of a
cultural Disneyland on their doorstep.
The choice of a famous architect with a defined philosophy has inevitably
prolonged the exercise. Richard Meier was a predictable choice when you look
at the composition of the competition jury. He was famous in the 1980s for
his museums in Germany, and for the High museum in Atlanta, Georgia.
His white metal-clad cubist houses brought a disciplined and cruel symmetry
to the minimal homes of the super-rich. His work is abstract, and he uses
only the history of a brief period of modernism as his palette. There was
such a predictability about his white buildings in the 1970s and '80s that
he became known as the 'Frigidaire architect', and many doubts have been
expressed about his suitability for the Getty. The magnificent site demands
the opposite of a clinical approach, so the question has to be asked: does a
random scattering of cubist elements, some clad in stone, some in white
metal, significantly enrich the Los Angeles landscape?
The symbolism of these hermetic blocks on top of a mountain does not suggest
that the Getty is particularly concerned about making fine art an accessible
part of life. Conservationists, acquisitive curators and academics are a bad
combination when it comes to museums. Inevitably, they feel proprietorial
about their collections, and are often unable to make their researches more
relevant than a secret shared among a few competitive colleagues.
The idea for a campus of six main buildings, each one dedicated to different
aspects of art preservation and education, was to bring together a college
of experts on one site to ensure harmonious dialogue and a stimulating
atmosphere for research. The Getty is being built at a time when the great
information explosion and advances in computer technology have made it
completely unnecessary to have all your scholars and books and collections
in one place.
Building a home for some of the most important and most expensive works of
art in the world on top of a mountain in a city regularly threatened by
earthquakes is risky. Great sums of money have been spent to try and ensure
that the centre can withstand major shocks.
There has also been vast expenditure on landscaping and tree-planting to
satisfy the neighbours' demands for an almost invisible building. Three
years into the construction programme the only completed buildings are the
vast underground garage and a tram station for the funicular that will give
visitors a ride around the site.
It is important to remember that the Getty has huge grant-making and
educational programmes which have a more useful and less visible impact on
the world than this monumental project. But it is the work of Richard Meier
that will leave the greatest impression.
There is considerable unhappiness about the removal of so many great works
of art from around the world to this mountain-top mausoleum. The scale of
the museum's wealth means that however carefully it buys, it will be seen as
predatory and reactionary in its desire to own so much for itself. The fact
that the British government decided not to let the sculpture of the Three
Graces go to the Getty is a small signal that the days of its domination in
the art market may be over, at least for now.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Media Futures: ITV line to better schedules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ITV Network has developed a computer system designed to predict the most
effective programming schedule in terms both of size of audience and
attractiveness to advertisers. ITV executives believe that the Evaluator, as
the system is being called, is the world's most sophisticated computerised
aid for programme scheduling.
For example, if ITV was considering moving The Russ Abbott Show to Tuesday
at 9.00pm, the Evaluator would be able to predict how many people were
likely to watch and the demographic profile and viewing characteristics of
the audience.
'The ITV network has a tool to take its understanding and evaluation of
programme performance and audience delivery to a higher level than
previously,' David Brennan, controller of audience planning for the ITV
Network Centre, told a Media Week conference at the weekend.
The Evaluator is going to be launched formally within the next few weeks.
After extensive testing to make sure is does not recommend playing top ITV
programmes such as Coronation Street at midnight, it will be let loose on
real schedules from the beginning of next year.
An essential ingredient in creating Evaluator has been the use of
confidential information from advertising agencies on their overall TV
spending, broken down into sub-demographic groups, the proportion of the UK
population they want to reach with advertisements and at what frequency.
This financial information was used to place a relative value on each member
of the panel of viewers that provides the official BARB TV ratings. After
analysing the audience to every networked programme transmitted so far this
year, it has been possible to place monetary values against each programme.
To try to predict accurately both the audience and advertising effects of
changes to the schedule, Evaluator has gone one step further. It has applied
cluster analysis to the viewing habits of every member of the BARB panel
over 12 weeks. They were divided up, not only into heavy, medium and light
viewers but into a total of 23 different categories according to their
viewing tastes and preferences.
Brennan said he had no doubt that Evaluator would be an important
decision-making tool both for the Network Centre and the individual ITV
companies, even though sometimes decisions would be taken despite
computerised recommendations.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Newspapers: the eyes have it - A case for
traditional reading matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WINSTON FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a truth universally acknowledged that newspapers will soon be popping
their clogs - that the newspaper is to television what the pony and trap was
to the motor car.
I beg to differ. Unarguably, newspaper circulations have fallen during the
40 or so years since television got going. But they have not plummeted. In
the mid-1950s, when post-war newsprint rationing ended and papers were
artificially cheap, the total circulation of Britain's national dailies
peaked at 16.7m. After 35 years of television, that figure had dropped to
15.6m. During the late 1980s, total circulations grew.
The Sundays, admittedly, fared worse in the 1950s and 1960s, but likewise
later stabilised. So the walk to the virtual scaffold, if such it be, has
been long and sedate.
The soothsayers believe the walk is about to turn into a trot. Their on-line
tea leaves predict that as televisual communications become faster, cheaper,
more sophisticated, more flexible - and interactive - people will get more
and more of their news, data, entertainment and know-how off the screen.
Before too long, everything newspapers now offer will be provided
televisually, and everyone knows that a pixel is worth 1,000 words, don't
they? Again, I beg to differ.
Forget, for the moment, superhighways, CD-Roms, surfing on the Internet and
the plethora of less-than-user-friendly hyper-jargon. Think, instead, about
the human eye - upon which, in the end, all the cybernetic doodahs depend.
From the eye's point of view there are several key differences between
printed communications and televisual communications. First, televisual
communications must be sequential. In future it may be possible to alter the
sequences - to get your sport at the beginning of the TV news instead of at
the end. Even that will be hideously difficult and costly. But you will
never be able to start at the end and work backward. Or, if you do, you
won't be able to make sense of it.
You can't make much sense of watching film backwards. Human eyes (and ears
and brains) don't work that way. But human eyes can, and do, start anywhere
on a page, and skip around. This will prove to be much more significant than
it may seem, for it leads to another - perhaps still more significant -
difference between printed and televisual media. The eye can scan this
entire edition of the FT in minutes, selecting the items you want to explore
further. Imagine doing that by pressing buttons to bring articles on to your
screen. You might hardly get beyond sorting out the leader page.
And this is anything but unimportant. To read your FT from beginning to end
(excluding the market prices) would take six or seven hours. (Even reading
The Sun would take a couple of hours). So it would be impossible to include
the full contents of the FT - or even of The Sun  - in a television news
programme.
With a newspaper your eyes can sort out what interests you most and
eliminate what does not. You can start to read an article, then stop, or hop
from paragraph to paragraph, or go back and re-read if you haven't
understood something. Try doing that on a screen, with or without a remote
control.
Not that there is much benefit in getting data from a screen if you have to
read it. The benefit of a screen is either that an announcer can read it to
you (but how slow), or that the data can be interwoven with relevant film
material (making it sequentially time-consuming). True, screens can
constantly update data, as can radio. But how many areas of information
require continuous updating? Even watching the news non-stop is dullsville.
Sky News and CNN are great to dip into - dreary as hell to sit glued to.
And I have not even mentioned the more mundane benefits of newspapers. They
are portable, light, silent, very cheap and can be disposed of easily. They
can be studied, scribbled on and passed around. They don't crash or catch
viruses. They can be stuck on notice-boards and photo-copied. Above all,
they can be handled by non-computer-literate, non-dextrous, non-interactive
dumb human beings like me.
With all these advantages, one cannot help but wonder whether - had TV been
invented by Caxton and printing by John Logie Baird - seers would not now be
predicting the demise of TV and an explosion of printed communications.
Advertisers are in no doubt about the efficacy of printed messages. Although
their market share has dipped, total print media in Britain still account
for 55 per cent of all advertising expenditure compared with 28 per cent for
television. (In fact, the fastest-growing UK advertising medium at the
moment is homely, old-fashioned steam radio).
None of which is intended to imply that televisual communications are not
about to grow rapidly. Patently they are. But they are less competitive with
newspapers than they seem. The two forms of media complement each other, and
will co-exist for as far ahead as the human eye can see. And it will be the
human eye - not futuristic technology - which evaluates their relative
strengths and weaknesses.
If Britain's national dailies continue to lose circulation, as they have in
the past, by 1.1m copies every 35 years - we are talking trends, aren't we?
 -they will still be selling 2m or so copies daily in 2,500. That is not a
problem I can get worked up about right now.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: The hard trail to post-sanctions Iraq -
Tips for the business optimist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Visiting Baghdad is still not easy. It takes an arduous 12- to 14-hour drive
from Amman to get there. Hotels are stripped of the least luxury. Doing
business in anything but food and medicines requires approval from the stern
UN sanctions committee. How much money Iraq's government has to pay for
things is a matter of doubt. And the post-sanctions atmosphere in the Middle
East's most oppressively policed state is not festive.
None of this, however, has deterred coachloads of French, Italian, Russian,
Turkish, Canadian and even a few hardy British businessmen from making the
trip - all preparing for the day when the shackle of sanctions is unlocked
from what, before the Gulf war, was among the region's richest markets.
So, some tips for dogged optimists:
All non-Arab visitors require a visa to get into Baghdad, which is more than
a formality given Iraq's lack of diplomatic relations with most western
countries, whose governments mostly discourage all visits to Iraq.
Iraq's embassy in Amman is well used to processing journalists' visas, and
might be worth calling directly for information on business passes. Visa
approval takes time. Most countries also have an Iraqi interest section in a
'neutral' local embassy. In Baghdad itself, US and British interests are
represented by the Polish and Russian embassies, for instance.
Once a visa is approved, travellers will need to start their journey in
Jordan. There is then no alternative but to travel the Amman-Baghdad desert
highway, which takes a minimum of 12 hours if you are lucky enough to take
only an hour crossing the border. But be warned: it can take several hours
to cross.
Taxis can easily be hired in Amman - for instance through the
Intercontinental Hotel - and prices vary with demand and bargaining
abilities. But count on paying around Dollars 250 per one-way trip in one of
the numerous big GMC Suburban taxis which ply the route. Saloon cars are
cheaper, but 12 cramped hours is a long, long drive. In Iraq itself, travel
by day if possible, for diplomats warn against driving anywhere in Iraq by
night and travellers have been robbed and killed on the Amman-Baghdad road
recently.
Crossing the border is relatively straight-forward, but those taking
personal computers should have them marked on the entry visa. An 'Aids test'
(ie, a means of relieving foreigners of Dollars 50) at the border is
obligatory, so equip yourself with sterilised needles. If you are lucky, and
you or your driver are savvy enough, the 'Aids test' can be circumvented by
a small 'gift' at the border. A pack of Marlboros might suffice, and are a
good thing to have about you at all times.
In Baghdad, all main hotels are operating, and the al-Rasheed (as seen on
CNN), the Meridien and Sheraton all offer rooms at Dollars 100 a night plus
a small Iraq dinar charge for obligatory breakfast - usually an anaemic
omelette. Food is in critically short supply in Iraq, and hotels and
restaurants offer meagre fare, so it is worth stocking up on food and drinks
before leaving. Such goods would be gratefully accepted by Iraqi business
partners.
All substantial bills can be met in US dollars, but it is worth changing
some into Iraqi dinars. And forget credit cards. Swap Dollars 100 at first,
which will produce enough low-denomination dinars to stuff a briefcase. By
the time you leave you will be able to count notes with the dexterity of a
bank-teller, for in hyper-inflationary Baghdad even paying a restaurant bill
will remind you of playing Monopoly.
Not that Baghdad's once-buzzing restaurants are what they were. The shortage
of food and a recent ban on public drinking has plunged the city's best
eateries into sad, deserted gloom.
The al-Diwan 'Chinese' restaurant, with Tunisian cook, at the al-Hamra hotel
still manages a cheap, passable but tiny-portioned meal. The al-Mudeef
restaurant on the Tigris corniche is also worth trying, and highly
picturesque, but when I drew the waiters' attention to a big rat contentedly
weaving through the feet of customers on its way to the kitchen, they barely
shrugged.
Beware, too, the once cheap and cheerful Tigris-side fish restaurants. It is
still possible to choose a tasty-looking live fish to grill, but UN experts
in Baghdad warn that they are more than usually nourished these days on
fecal matter poured into the river, so chase your meal down with some
immodium.
Getting around Baghdad is no problem. Each hotel has plenty of
over-attentive taxi drivers who will charge Dollars 50 a day. Many of them
live in the big hotels, and are keen to act as guides. They will not prove
the most critical or independent observers of Iraq's political system, but
this is not a topic you should try to discuss. It might also prove highly
risky to take up these drivers' offers to change money at black-market
rates. No foreign visitor will go anywhere, do anything or meet anyone
without being closely watched or reported upon.
Communications with the outside world are also a problem, unless you have
access to a satellite telephone. Most business locals telex home base for a
call-back, which usually comes through to the main hotels quickly and
readily. Overseas calls from the big hotels can be booked, but take hours.
All of which compounds the mood of cheerless isolation which descends
swiftly on visitors to Baghdad. Day trips can alleviate things: Babylon is
an hour away by taxi, for example. And there are shopping opportunities for
those with a strong enough heart to buy fine carpets and silver from locals
who need money to buy food. However, rigorous customs checks when you are
leaving mean you might lose your purchases without recourse.
If none of this deters you - the best of luck.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Hotel costs fall in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Japanese hotel rates have plunged this year, but Tokyo and Osaka remain the
most expensive cities in the world in which to rent a room, according to
Hogg Robinson Business Travel International.
Hogg Robinson said prices paid by its clients show that Tokyo's rates have
fallen 16 per cent to an average of Pounds 167.18 a night, while Osaka's
dropped 29 per cent to Pounds 143.87, the biggest fall for any important
city in the world. Even with the decrease, Osaka was the world's second most
expensive city.
Hong Kong was third, with rates up 12 per cent to Pounds 131.24, and New
York fourth on Pounds 126.11, 4 per cent higher. Fifth spot was taken by
Zurich - average rates of Pounds 123.37, a fall of 6 per cent  - and then
came Kowloon (Pounds 117.99) and Washington (Pounds 110.89).
Frankfurt was in eighth (Pounds 108.18), Paris (Pounds 107.12) ninth and
Copenhagen (Pounds 106.73) 10th. London, regarded by many as an over-priced
hotel city, is only the 39th most expensive, Hogg Robinson says. London's
rates fell 3 per cent this year to Pounds 80.35.
Mike Gates, a Hogg Robinson director, says that travellers should not be
repulsed by London's high advertised room rates. Far lower prices are
available to those who shop around.

Hyatt Hotels is to offer guests the chance to book rooms in its North
American properties through the Internet, the worldwide computer network,
writes Michael Skapinker. Personal computer users can already request
details of Hyatt rooms, restaurants and leisure facilities over the
Internet, and view colour photographs of the hotels. By the end of next
month they will be able to book rooms at 103 Hyatt hotels and resorts in the
US and Canada. Hyatt plans to extend the facility to travel agents. Thisco,
the company which is setting up Internet booking for Hyatt, said it plans to
add other hotel companies to the network eventually.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines says it is offering reductions of up to 35 per cent
on business-class fares to destinations outside Europe from now to April 1.
A spokeswoman said most reductions would be about 20 per cent, though 35 per
cent was possible in some cases. KLM is aiming its reductions at
business-class travellers whose companies have no formal ticket-purchasing
contract with it - an area, said the spokeswoman, in which KLM faces heavy
competition from other European carriers.

London City Airport has launched new routes to Geneva and Hamburg, and says
it is celebrating another 'tremendous increase' in passenger numbers.
Crossair, the Swiss airline, which has services to Zurich and Lugano, has
added a twice-daily flight to Geneva. And Lufthansa has added five flights a
week to Hamburg, as well as improving its flight schedule to Frankfurt.
London City Airport says 49,680 passengers used its flights last month, a 76
per cent gain on October last year. It now serves 11 destinations, but plans
to add to them at year's turn.

Even the bedside Gideon Bible is not safe from the clutches of business
executives staying in hotels, says a survey by Britain's Reed Travel Group.
Coat-hangers, cutlery and TV remote-controls are other items they take,
while nightclothes, underwear and ties top the list of things they leave.
Younger business travellers are the most light-fingered. British executives
visit the US on business more than their European counterparts. One in five
business travellers takes exercise while away. The survey covered 1,270
business travellers.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Business Travel: Special offers
</HEADLINE>

Big savings on classy European hotel rooms are possible this winter for
customers who investigate the special offers, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
For example, Meridien is offering winter promotional rates at its 11
European hotels from December 1 to March 31: up to 50 per cent off published
tariffs. Promotional rates for a night's stay in a single or twin/double
room, including taxes and services, range from Dollars 266 in the private
Club President section of the Meridien Etoile in Paris to Dollars 102 in
Porto and Dollars 73 in Limassol. In London: Dollars 260.
Wise travellers know that hotels often offer a limited number of rooms at
promotional rates (as in this case), so advance bookings are essential. But
try to haggle. The London Meridien in Piccadilly is offering 15 rooms at the
special rate, with free access to Champney's Health Club but breakfast
excluded. You could ask, in a penetrating voice, why the deal at Club
President in Paris includes a free continental breakfast for virtually the
same price as London's breakfastless promo. See where it gets you.

In a thin week for pop releases, compilations once more dominate the scene.
The most interesting of these is Nothing Less Than Brilliant - The Best of
Sandie Shaw (Virgin), spanning a 30-year career which virtually tells the
story of British pop, from the bouncy innocence of 'There's Always Something
There To Remind Me' to her collaboration with the laconic Morrisey and The
Smiths. Even more obviously aimed for the Christmas market is Fields of Gold
 -The Best Of Sting (A&amp;M), a reasonable enough collection which also
includes two new tracks. Finally, The Best of Youssou N'Dour (Virgin)
contains highlights from the career of one of Africa's best-known musicians
and includes some of his work with Peter Gabriel.
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, the creative force behind Led Zeppelin, put
their talents together again for the first time in 14 years on No Quarter -
Unledded (Fontana). The once-dynamic duo have sought inspiration from Indian
and Moroccan musicians who play on live reworkings of some of the band's
previous material. It is an adventurous album, much more imaginative than
the standard ageing-rock star reunion, which also includes some new songs.
Three of the greatest operas in the repertoire get fresh releases this week.
Followers of late Verdi are particularly well-served: first there is Otello
(Deutsche Grammophon) with Placido Domingo once again interpreting one of
the roles at which he excels and Cheryl Studer as Desdemona; Myung-Whun
Chung conducts the Orchestre et Choeurs de l'Opera Bastille. Then there is a
live recording of Falstaff (Sony), with Juan Pons playing the title role and
Riccardo Muti conducting the Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala. Cheryl Studer
also stars in Deutsche Gramophon's new Lohengrin, with Siegfried Jerusalem
as the eponymous hero and Claudio Abbado conducting the Wiener
Philharmoniker. Abbado and the Berliner Philharmoniker feature in a series
of new live recordings on the Sony label, which include Tchaikovsky's
Symphony No 5, Dvorak's Symphony No 8 and music by Brahms, Strauss, Reger
and Rihm inspired by the poems of Friedrich Holderlin. Most imaginative
collection of the lot is an album dedicated to the myth of Prometheus in
music, featuring interpretations by Beethoven, Liszt, Scriabin and Nono.

FT  07 NOV 94 / This Week: The mystery that is Formula One - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hamlet should have been running Formula One motor racing. 'The play's the
thing,' he urged as the Danish monarchy struggled to shake off some terrible
PR. Despite a season that could scarcely have begun with worse portents,
including the death of Ayrton Senna and the Benetton fire, somehow the Grand
Prix circus is once again delivering the goods.
The duel between Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill for the championship is
providing a finish that hasn't been as tight or absorbing since Senna v
Prost in 1991, while the newly-announced partnership of Mercedes and McLaren
shows that F1 is still the motor-sport arena that counts with the biggest
motor companies.
Worldwide television audiences have shown a huge increase, against all
pre-season predictions. ('Don't under-estimate the morbid desire to watch
the 20th slo-mo replay of Senna's death,' a cynic in the pit-lane cautioned
me). In his office above Knightsbridge, in London, barrister Max Mosley, who
is the ringmaster of Grand Prix, is cautiously satisfied.
Overall, he says, the most important end-of-term conclusion is that the
officials are back in charge of their massively powerful vehicle.
'Basically, we try to slow the cars down and the teams attempt to speed them
up,' he says. 'This season we have proved that we can control the
technology, for the good of the sport.'
Regulating a game like soccer - 22 lads and a ball - cannot be anything like
as difficult as regulating Grand Prix. The sport lives or dies by its
creation of technical regulations to produce closely-matched racing. Yet
when every Formula One car receives between 50 and 100 modifications between
each race, the task of scrutineering becomes impossible.
'The days when you employed an engineer with a micrometer, tape measure and
oily rag are over,' says Mosley. 'A device like traction control, for
example, will have several million lines of code in the on-board computer.
Checking something like that requires an expert.'
Last winter the governing bodies agonised over repeated criticisms that the
average F1 race had become a dollar-driven technology procession. The
best-funded teams had cars that were unbeatable. Drivers were becoming jaded
button-pushers, ran the argument. Mosley, a former competitor, was
sympathetic.
Traction control was banned, and next season sees smaller three-litre
engines and revised aerofoil systems, all designed to reward driver skill
and innovative low-budget teams.
Yet surely all this is window-dressing. In terms of results, nothing has
changed. After Williams, McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari, the average
non-afficianado would struggle to name an F1 team. The only glimpse most of
us have of a Simtek or a Ligier is when the on-board camera on Schumacher's
car shows them being lapped.
'I think we've closed the gap somewhat,' claims Mosley, stopwatch and
calculator in hand. 'The top 20 cars this season would have lap times within
three seconds of each other. I don't think Formula One has ever been so
competitive.'
There are those who say that the sport created its own suspense and stopped
the season being a total Benetton benefit when it banned Schumacher for two
races and disqualified him after he had crossed the line first in Belgium.
It put Damon Hill back in with a chance, which he consolidated by winning
the Japanese Grand Prix yesterday. Does the sport now require quasi-judicial
intervention to ensure that excitent is maintained?
'People talk blithely about a Golden Age,' counters Mosley. 'But there were
huge disparities in performance in those days. One Mercedes would lap the
field, and if there were three Mercedes, they'd all lap you. A podium result
remains very, very hard to get.'
Without huge financial muscle, all the talent and engineering imagination in
the world is just froth in Grand Prix racing. Jordan is now being spoken of
as a potential force for 1995. Why? Because it has been adopted by Peugeot,
discarded as engine-suppliers by a McLaren happily besotted with mighty
Mercedes.
'The really big money is now being spent by the major manufacturers who
provide the engines,' says Mosley. Although critics of F1 profligacy
invariably take cigarette sponsors as their example, it is now the motor
industry that is calling the shots. When Nigel Mansell came back for one
race in mid-season it was at the insistence of Renault, at the budgetary
heart of the Williams team.
Worried by the adulatory coverage Peugeot was receiving, Renault needed a PR
coup on the eve of the French Grand Prix. Again, it was Renault which booked
Mansell to drive for the last three events of this season. Only a company
that big could afford to pay him the Dollars 1.5m he was demanding per
appearance. There was also a 'disappointment' clause. If Williams/Renault
told Mansell he was 'excused driving' at Jerez, Suzuka or Adelaide, then the
driver was to receive an additional Dollars 3m for hurt pride.
Grand Prix racing remains an enigma. Much of it is unappealing or just plain
boring. When danger delivers the goods, with a fatality, it is revolting.
Yet it goes from strength to strength, recovering miraculously from
near-mortal wounds. Mosley talks about an innate mysticism. He says: 'No one
knows why Formula One is so popular. But it is. So don't let's change it too
much.'

Martin Chuzzlewit (Monday, 9.00-10.30pm, BBC2) is ready to roll over us in a
wave of carriages and corsets. Paul Schofield plays Chuzzlewit Pere with
aplomb; as if this wasn't enough, he also takes on the part of Anthony
Chuzzlewit. In the opening episode, Chuzzlewit Fils, as played by Ben Walden
(son of Brian), is somewhat leaden but this is compensated for by a splendid
supporting cast, and there is John Mills still to come. Two endings have
been shot. The one preferred by David Lodge, who adapted the novel, is an
upbeat one with three weddings; that favoured by director Pedr James is a
downbeat monologue delivered by Tom Pinch. Despite this mild controversy,
the drama delivers exactly what you expect, making it a bit of an old
chestnut, pleasing though it is when served roasted over a crackling fire by
extras in wigs and false moustaches.
Dominick Dunne became the leading American crime reporter with his coverage
of the Claus Von Bulow case and the Menendez brothers' trial. 'Dominick did
a better job than the prosecutor in the Menendez case', says the editor of
Vanity Fair, as well he might since Dunne is one of his star writers.
Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.20-11.10pm, BBC1) profiles the novelist and writer who
was born into a wealthy East Coast family, hit hard times and then rebuilt
his career and life. The result is a fascinating piece, not least because of
the comments made by the Menendez defence lawyer with whom Dunne has carried
on a public feud.
Richard Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings And A Funeral, has come up with
another altar-obsessed comedy, The Vicar Of Dibbley (Thursday, 8.30-9.00pm,
BBC1). Dawn French is the new vicar of the eponymous village which is
expecting atestosterone-driven prelate and has to adjust. This has the same
essentially English approach to comedy as Curtis's hit film, but on a
smaller scale - more like Two Christenings And A Small Sherry.
Terence Rattigan is enjoying a success he hasn't had since John Osborne
looked back in anger. After a London revival last year, The Deep Blue Sea is
getting a BBC production (Saturday, 9.30-11.10pm, BBC2), directed by Karel
Reisz. This is a gritty play, far removed from the polite pieces Rattigan is
associated with. It begins with an attempted suicide. Penelope Wilton has
perfected her Hester Collyer and gets splendid support from Ian Holm and
Colin Firth as the two men in her life.
Ever since Hilda Ogden hung up her pinny, the mantle of loveable TV shrew
has settled round Thora Hird's shoulders, and this week Melvynn Bragg pays
tribute in The South Bank Show (Sunday, 10.45-11.45pm, ITV). Dame Thora is
now 83 and well into her anecdotage. But it hardly matters since the
anecdotes are of vintage quality ,supplemented by clips from her 60-year
career.

With subtitled films breaking out all over, it is time to start those
up-down-across eye movement exercises. Special agility will be needed for
the French dialogue (lots of it) in Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colours
Red, opening this week. The film rounds off the Polish director's tricouleur
trilogy with a piquant blend of comedy, mystery and garrulous
philosophising. The theme is 'fraternity', the setting Geneva. Irene Jacob
plays the young model who becomes enmeshed in the life of a retired judge
(Jean-Louis Trintignant) with a fondness for electronic eavesdropping. The
visuals are dazzling - look how the title colour is picked out in each scene
 -and the performances expert. But is there also a hint of deja vu in this
farewell movie, revisiting old themes, from Europe's top film-maker, who
recently announced his retirement?
At the London Film Festival, subtitles by the vanload. But three movies this
week make reading the bottom of the screen worthwhile. Ang Lee's Eat Drink
Man Woman is a delicious comedy of food and love from the Taiwanese who gave
us The Wedding Banquet. Neak Sre's Rice People is a powerful, tragedy-prone
tale of the land from Cambodia. And in Italy's Dear Diary,
comedian-filmmaker Nanni Moretti (best director, Cannes) hops between three
mournfully funny tales in the Woody Allen style.
To give us language-wrestlers a rest, British cinema is also well
represented. Highly spoken of: Danny Boyle's Glaswegian thriller/black
comedy Shallow Grave. Personally vouched for by me: Anna Campion's Loaded, a
spooky tale of psycho-gothic revelation. Oddest curio: Charles Massot's
Kabloonak, a movie about movie-making with Charles Dance braving the howling
Arctic as Nanook Of The North documentarist Robert Flaherty.
Finally, more Britishness on video. Four Weddings And A Funeral slips into
cassette form, even while our highest-earning film ever still coins it at
cinemas. The only subtitles needed here are for Hugh Grant's daffy hero, who
speaks with an upper-crust, oh-I-say accent that surely went out with P G
Wodehouse. Only the fact that he speaks it with such champagne brio
convinces us that we almost understand it.

RUGBY UNION: England v Romania, November 12, Twickenham
There have been two talking points in rugby union over the last week. The
first was England's new manager and coach, Jack Rowell (see People Page),
backing down over his demand that his squad of players should not turn out
for their clubs on the Saturday before international matches. The second was
the oh-so-sharp pen of former England stand-off Stuart Barnes. Comments in
Barnes' recently-published autobiography led to England hooker Brian Moore
starting libel proceeding, and accepting a Pounds 4,000 out-of-court
settlement. Then, in his Daily Telegraph column, Barnes caused a furore by
claiming that England captain Will Carling was not pulling his weight at
Harlequins and should be replaced by Philip de Glanville in the England
side. Supporters are waiting to see how Carling responds in the first of six
matches that England play before next year's World Cup in South Africa.
MOTOR RACING: Australian Grand Prix, November 13, Adelaide.
One race left and one point in it. Damon Hill's win in yesterday's
rain-soaked, crash-riddled Japanese Grand Prix means that the 34-year-old
Londoner goes to Australia trailing Germany's Michael Schumacher by the
narrowest of margins in the race for the championship. Schumacher is still
considered to be the best driver around. But so was Jim Clark when Damon's
father beat him for the world crown.

FT  07 NOV 94 / This Week: FT Guide to The Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare for a day to pass without mention of the Internet. What is it?
The easiest way to think of the Internet is as an international telephone
system for computers. A system of more than 7,500 individual computer
networks, the Internet connects more than 2m computers and 25m people. Just
as the international telephone system makes possible conversations between
individuals anywhere on the planet, so the Internet makes it possible for
computers to exchange messages and information.
Why has it suddenly sprung to prominence?
This is a consequence of the spread of low-cost, powerful computers. The
Internet grew out of a 1969 US Department of Defence project, Arpanet,
designed to link international research teams. The scientists used the
network to disseminate messages and information, and the US government
sponsored its extension to colleges and universities. Today, the National
Research and Education Network, funded by the National Science Foundation,
is the backbone of the Internet in the US.
Computer hobbyists were the first outside the academic community to discover
the benefits of the Internet. As more companies and individuals gain access
to computers and modems (the equivalent of a telephone handset for a
computer), its popularity has soared. Usage is said to be growing at 10 per
cent a month.
What are these benefits?
There are three: ability to send electronic messages to individuals or
groups; the capacity to send large volumes of data rapidly around the globe
(this is a spin-off from the Internet's role as a tool for scientists); and
access to vast amounts of information held on computer databases (among
other things: the complete scripts of Rowan Atkinson's Black Adder
television programmes).
Without doubt, the chief use of the Internet is as a vehicle for electronic
mail. One US corporation exchanges almost 2m Internet messages with people
outside the company every month.
What are the disadvantages?
Power is one. You need a fast computer with plenty of memory to make the
best use of the Internet. Another is navigating the system. Finding what you
want from the bewildering variety of information on offer can be expensive
and time-consuming. Indices and search tools are becoming available, but
they are in early development. And because the Internet developed in an ad
hoc way, there is no central ownership or authority. Management is in the
hands of the users, or at least those users who feel they can contribute to
the Internet Engineering Planning Group: a little daunting for computing
tyros.
How do I get on to the Internet?
Internet users are often connected through their colleges or companies.
Otherwise, you will need to employ an Internet service provider (ISP), which
will, for a fee, arrange access to the Net. In Britain, examples include
Pipex, Cityscape and Demon Internet Services; in France, Oleane; Germany,
X-Link and Maz; Italy, IT-Net; Sweden, Switnet. In Britain, the BBC has
contracted with Pipex to provide low-cost access as a feature of its
programme The Net.
What will I need to join and what will it cost me?
Basically, a powerful personal computer equipped with a modem. After that,
it depends of the level of service, but typically in Britain it will cost an
individual between Pounds 12.50 and Pounds 50 for the software, together
with a monthly fee of Pounds 10 or Pounds 15. You will also have to pay the
cost of the local telephone call to your service provider while you are
connected to the network. In addition, you may have to pay, at business
rates, for information drawn from commercial databases.
You will be registered as an Internet subscriber with a unique address of
your choosing, so long as it follows the Internet format: name, short
address, type of organisation and country. For example: alan. cane.@ ft. co.
uk.
It sounds a little anarchic. Can businesses use it with confidence?
In the past few years, companies have begun to use the Internet on a wide
scale. Perhaps 60 per cent of the traffic on the Net is now commercial in
origin. It has become the information highway of the 1990s.
What about stories of security failures?
The Internet is self-policing, which means that breaches quickly become
public knowledge. Nevertheless, the network was not built with security as a
priority. The intention was to encourage use rather than keep people out.
The ISPs can build a 'firewall' - a secure computer - between the Internet
and a company's own computer systems to prevent hacking and intrusion, while
individuals can encrypt their messages using facilities in their
word-processing software.
Who, if anybody, is making money out of the Internet?
Companies such as Cisco, Welfleet and Synoptics, which build the switches
and routers to manage the networks, are making good profits. The ISPs and
information-providers are still in the investment phase. The network is,
after all, only three years old as a vehicle for commercial traffic.
And the future?
Peter Dawe of Pipex draws an analogy between a Roman road and a modern
motorway. The Internet will remain the principal medium for computer
inter-connection, even if it changes out of all recognition in the process.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Bad connections at BT - The telecoms company's
transformation has taken its toll on employee morale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecom's staff magazine - BT Today - is known inside the
organisation as BT Toady. It therefore came as a surprise to many employees
when the latest issue carried a devastating account of how attempts to
improve customer service in one corner of the organisation were failing
badly.
The letter, from a senior technician in Worldwide Networks, was unsigned,
but its basic message was simple. Despite the organisational upheavals of
the past few years customers were still fleeing to the competition because
of poor quality.
They were doing this because basically sound ideas, such as multi-skilling
and performance targets, were being implemented in a short-termist and
counter-productive way by managers either too remote or too frightened to
tell the truth.
Sir Iain Vallance, the BT chairman, to whom the letter was sent, praised it
as 'intelligent, articulate, to the point and just what we wanted from Total
Quality Management'. He regretted, however, that the engineer had remained
anonymous, while the staff magazine asked 'how can we overcome the culture
of fear?'.
The letter - which was only published after considerable internal debate -
is a sign that some of BT's senior managers are becoming concerned about
employee morale inside Europe's most profitable company.
There is much in the 10 years since privatisation for those managers to feel
satisfied about, particularly bearing in mind the introverted, civil service
mentality which still prevailed at the start of the period. The customer now
receives an incomparably better service at a lower price. The returns to
shareholders have been impressive.
Some of those gains have been bought at the expense of employees. The
company has shed one-third of its UK employees - from 232,000 to 148,000 -
since 1990. Those that remain work harder in a less secure organisation and
their unions no longer have quasi-veto power over management decisions.
But even for employees things could be a lot worse. Pay and conditions,
especially for middle managers, are still well above average for equivalent
skills and experience. And thanks to the generous redundancy terms
accompanying the job cuts not a day has been lost in industrial action, a
remarkable record for a highly-unionised company.
The way that blue-chip BT has handled its employee relations in recent years
is often regarded as a model by its peers. Mike Bett, the former head of
personnel and deputy chairman of the company, has just been elected
president of the Institute of Personnel and Development, Britain's main
personnel body.
But as BT braces itself for the next 10 years of life in the private sector
 -a period which will be incomparably tougher than the first 10 thanks to
competition and the new regulatory framework - cracks are beginning to
appear in the shiny self-image of employee relations successfully reformed.
At the normally placid employee annual meeting earlier this year Michael
Hepher, BT's managing director, was almost assaulted as tempers boiled over.
Hepher says that much of the anger was due to the uncertainty surrounding a
disposal of part of the business which was resolved soon after.
That is only part of the story. Almost all speakers complained about job
insecurity but they also complained about lack of trust, excessive use of
outside contractors, 'flavour of the month' organisational reforms, the
disappearance of pride in working for BT. A young graduate entrant said that
most of her peers were already looking for new jobs and the company was
finding it hard to fill graduate vacancies in some parts of the country.
Internal BT surveys suggest that only around one fifth of employees believe
that senior managers can be relied upon to do what they say they will do. A
similarly low proportion believe that the changes going on inside the
company are good for them and even fewer believe that they have job
security.
A survey by the National Communications Union, the main BT union, found
employees in customer service centres strongly commited to delivering a
service to the customer, but a large majority no longer felt any commitment
to working for BT.
Such attitudes are also common among the 70,000 engineers, who were hit by
the first big wave of redundancies. A recent dispute over more
customer-friendly working hours for engineers seemed to illustrate not
opposition to the changes but mistrust of how local managers would implement
them.
Many of these attitude problems are unavoidable when a once paternalistic
company such as BT has to cut both its numbers and its cost base so rapidly.
But BT managers are now beginning to wonder how to prevent poor morale
affecting business in an organisation where a large proportion of employees
have daily contact with customers.
The job reduction programme is at the root of many morale problems. BT is
still committed to voluntary redundancy, and has paid a high price for that
commitment. Redundancy pay - which averages about Pounds 35,000 - has cost
Pounds 2bn over the past two years, but there are other costs associated
with the commitment including re-training the nearly 3,500 people currently
being redeployed and even paying a few dozen people to sit at home on full
pay. 'We can afford to be generous as long as we remain successful,' says
Hepher.
Nonetheless many people - especially, at present, those in middle management
 -apparently feel that voluntary redundancy exists only in name, and that
the insecurity will never end. Once the current target of a 100,000-employee
company is reached, people fear that the next target will be 50,000, and
with the introduction of intelligent networks they may be right.
Hepher can offer little comfort. 'Our biggest problem is those who have not
volunteered and who fear that one day we will have to move to compulsory
redundancies. . .that fear is entirely logical,' he says.
Some believe the commitment to voluntary redundancy has sent a confusing
signal to employees. On the one hand, they point out, BT seems to be saying
it is still the paternalistic employer which can guarantee a job, on the
other hand people such as Hepher spend much of their time saying that era
has gone forever.
Hepher says that voluntarism is not set in stone but is still compatible
with what the company needs to achieve. Many people believe that Hepher, who
came from outside BT three years ago, would like to scrap it but finds Sir
Iain standing in his way.
Outside consultants suggest that voluntarism has made it more difficult to
weed out poor performers. 'BT has lost some of its best people because of
the way the system works, and it is left with an unusually wide range of
people from extremely good to surprisingly dim,' said one.
Outsiders also complain about how much management time the redundancy system
consumes and how politicised it is. A few people have been targeted for
redundancy on the basis of their appearance or how they write reports. One
marketing manager achieved sales 50 per cent higher than target last year
and received a large pay bonus, but then found herself on a list of people
to go.
But the cause of dissatisfaction is not only job cuts. According to Jeannie
Drake, deputy general-secretary of the NCU, it is also the insensitive way
the company is being restructured for those left behind.
The unions accept that job cuts through technology and competition are
unavoidable and believe that they have played an important role in
delivering orderly shrinkage, despite their reduced influence at local
level.
A degree of corporatism still lives on at national level - the recent
dispute over flexible working was, for example, finally resolved in a
private chat between Hepher and Tony Young, leader of the NCU - and Hepher,
who had never before worked with unions, is full of praise for their
trustworthiness and rationality.
But the unions complain angrily about some of the new managers who they
claim cannot consult at all or whose idea of communication is to inform
engineers repeatedly that they are very expensive compared with contractors
(which is true).
Drake points to the way seemingly conflicting targets create despondency.
She cites the customer service centre staff - the company's front-line staff
 -who were subject to a 25 per cent cut in numbers, while at the same time
being required to answer all calls in 15 seconds and provide better-quality
information.
The unions also fear a creeping decentralisation as local managers are given
more autonomy in the implementation of national rules. Hepher, however,
stresses the limits of decentralisation: 'I have regrettably concluded that
you need central direction on a lot of key things in an organisation like
this,' he says.
Some of these tensions are as unavoidable as those arising from job cuts,
and whatever its shortcomings BT has been improving productivity at about 10
per cent per year in recent years. It is regarded as a model by most large
European telephone companies and is closing the gap with the Americans.
'What strikes me is the way the company has struggled to preserve the best
of the old public service ethos while making itself fit for a brutal world
market,' says one consultant who has worked with BT since just after
privatisation.
There are even signs that the corner may have been turned on morale, at
least for the 70,000 engineers who are no longer the main focus for
redundancy. A popular experiment in Nottingham - eventually to be spread to
the whole country - will allow engineers to earn commission for passing on
new business from a customer.
Although 25,000 middle managers are now in the firing line on redundancies,
Hepher says he is considering a gentler way of approaching redundancy by
allowing people 'to sign up today to leave in 18 months' or two years'
time'.
Nevertheless, to many people - especially those aged between 35 and 50 who
have been in the organisation 10 or 15 years - the modern BT remains in
bewildering permanent revolution. They keep taking the medicine but they
never seem to get better.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Henry Ford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART CRAINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Ford (1863-1947) is routinely lauded as the man who brought the world
mass production lines. His idiosyncratic career (from boy racer to
multi-millionaire anti-war campaigner), as well as his many barbed
observations, tend to be forgotten. There was, however, more to Ford than
flow lines, workers doing mindlessly repetitive tasks and the ubiquitous
Model T.
Marketing guru Ted Levitt has argued that Ford's genius actually lay in
marketing, not manufacturing. Ford first decided that the world was ready
for an affordable car; and then that mass-production techniques were the
only way of providing it. Instead of controlling costs to produce lower
prices, Ford set the price and challenged the organisation to ensure costs
were low enough to meet the figure.
Ford's masterly piece of marketing lay in his intuitive realisation that the
middle-class car market existed - it just remained for him to provide the
products the market wanted. Model Ts were black, straightforward and
affordable. The trouble was that when other manufacturers added extras, Ford
kept it simple and dramatically lost ground. The man with a genius for
marketing lost touch with the aspirations of customers.
Even now, Ford's achievements remain impressive. He built his first car in
1896; started his own company in 1903; and between 1908 and 1927 produced
15m Model Ts. In 1920 Ford was making a car a minute.
Production was based around strict functional divides - demarcations. Ford
believed in people getting on with their jobs. He did not want engineers
talking to salespeople, or people making decisions without his say-so.
Management and managers he dismissed as largely unnecessary.
Ford did not invent the production line, he was inspired by what he had seen
in the slaughterhouses of Chicago. Others - such as musket-maker Eli Whitney
in the 19th century - had also made tentative steps towards the production
line. But Ford transformed it into a means of previously unimagined mass
production.
At the centre of Ford's thinking was the aim of standardisation - something
continually emphasised by the car makers of today although they talk in
terms of quality, and Ford in quantity.
While Ford will never be celebrated for his people management skills, he had
an international perspective which was ahead of his time. He was also
acutely aware that time was an important competitive weapon. 'Time waste
differs from material waste in that there can be no salvage.'
'In some respects Ford remains a good role model,' says Ray Wild, principal
of Henley Management College. 'He was an improviser and innovator, he
borrowed ideas and then adapted and synthesised them. He developed flow
lines that involved people; now, we have flow lines without people, but no
one questions their relevance or importance. Although he is seen as having
de-humanised work, it shouldn't be forgotten that he provided a level of
wealth for workers and products for consumers which weren't previously
available.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Management: Sleazy relationships in the office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does the appointment, from outside and at the same time, of a husband and
wife to an organisation constitute sleaze at work, or simply a fairly
negotiated package deal? In the university world it is very widespread, but
because females keep their maiden name it is difficult to detect. Some
organisations frown upon the process, believing that nearly always one of
the pair is a freeloader often appointed to a position or role less for
ability, effort or motivation, more because of a relationship by blood or
marriage. A sort of 'job for the relatives' idea we used to dismiss as
unacceptable nepotism.
Others have come up with a rather grandiose theory based on the biological
idea of assortive mating. This argues that in general tall people marry tall
people; the bright seek out the bright; the sociable each other - so that
couples are frequently similar one-to-another.
A wonderful study done years ago showed people with the name of Schneider
(or Taylor), that is people who took their name from their job and were
required to be nimble of finger but not large of stature, were in fact
shorter than those called Schmidt (Smith) who being blacksmiths needed to be
big and strong. Hence, appointing two spouses of near equal merit is hardly
corrupt but a double bonus for the organisation.
If this theory were true, though, wouldn't one find lonely-hearts columns
involved in mate selection mentioning such things as consciousness,
computer-literacy and managerial competence? Ever seen; 'Male with strategic
perspective, decisional flair and organisational ability seeks prioritising
female to implement proactive visioning'?
Most interviewers have favourite questions which they believe reveal the
most about their interviewees. They acquire these from a range of different
sources. Some may have been asked a question themselves in the past and,
having then struggled with the answer, now think others might do likewise.
Some people may have heard other interviewers pose a question, been suitably
impressed and so plagiarised it. Others have purchased those 'self help'
type paperbacks, titled items such as One Hundred Tough Interview Questions.
A high-yield question is one that, quite literally, provides maximal amounts
of salient information. There is one question which I find most effective
and I have a pet theory about its high yield. The question is pretty simple.
'What is your favourite compliment?'
I believe this question taps into two things simultaneously: values and
insecurities. Almost by definition a good compliment is one which appeals to
one's values and priorities, and that makes it interesting in its own right.
Second, compliments often pick up insecurities. Beautiful women aren't
interested in compliments about their appearance, rich men are bored by
comments on their wealth. They both seek other accolades. Many beautiful
women attempt to write and would like to be thought of as intelligent,
sensitive and articulate (as well as beautiful). Intelligent people often
want to be witty, physically strong people, caring.
A favourite compliment reveals what one values and also what one is not
quite certain about. To learn that from one question can't be bad.
One of our technicians died very suddenly just under 10 years ago. He was a
computer enthusiast and a hungry consumer of catalogues, brochures and
magazines dedicated to the field. Of course his post kept coming from eager
manufacturers and publishing houses. And it still does.
In the past month he has received well over a dozen letters. Were these
being simply thrown away or were they being happily consumed by someone
else? Was it in fact convenient not to stop them or is it simply a nuisance
that nobody has taken the responsibility for? I decided to investigate.
I found that because identical catalogues and magazines went to other
technicians, the late, departed colleague's mail was simply dumped. Some
publishers were told there was no point continuing, but they did.
How long, I wonder, will this persist and what does it tell us about the
business? What determines when a name is taken off the file? I presume,
perhaps naively, that someone, somewhere, updates, checks, verifies and even
monitors a mailing list. But perhaps mailing lists are sold on without ever
being 'cleaned-up', as the computer jargon might have it. It may be that
because the hit rate for this sort of selling is so poor (maybe 2 per cent
of readers respond) it does not really pay to spend time and effort checking
out the corporeal status of those on the list. It may not be a way to
eternity, but getting on these junkmail lists may certainly keep one's
memory alive.

Employers are demanding more skills when looking for accountants and are
more likely to take on temporary staff, Robert Half, the recruitment

A survey, based on interviews with 200 senior managers, found that only one

with more than one in four six months ago.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Fears raised on school pay levels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Local management of schools has led to the appointment of less experienced
teachers, the Audit Commission says in a report published today.
The commission examined appointments in 74 schools and found that the
average salary scale point of newly appointed teachers had dropped in each
of the past three years from slightly over scale 7 to just over scale 5.
Mr John Vaughan-Jones, the commission's assistant director of local
government studies, said head teachers and governors tended to argue that
they were appointing younger staff to introduce more up-to-date teaching
methods. If that were the case the trend might now have levelled off.
Instead, it was continuing.

Mr David Martin last night resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He said he wanted to be free to take his
own line on government policy.
The MP for Portsmouth South had held the post for four years. He was
previously PPS to Mr Alan Clark as defence minister. Mr Martin declined to
comment on the reasons for his resignation, although he said that the matter
would become clear in due course.
Mr Hurd said: 'David Martin told me a little time ago that after four years
as a PPS he would like to regain his freedom of action.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Midlands groups see improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital spending by quoted west Midlands companies remained flat in the year
to June, although money spent on acquisitions rose 33 per cent.
The findings emerge from the annual analysis of 133 quoted companies in the
region by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick. It shows the companies moving out
of recession with collective pre-tax profits in 1993-94 of Pounds 2.01bn
compared with Pounds 1.37bn in 1992-93.
Capital spending over the period was Pounds 1.55bn, a slight increase on the
Pounds 1.53bn recorded in 1992-93, but this rise came after three years of
cuts. KPMG noted, however, that in the engineering sector, the staple of the
region's industry, capital spending was lower than in 1992-93.
Higher profitability encouraged directors to pay themselves more. After
three years of little or no pay increases, the average director's pay rose
in 1993-94 to Pounds 82,800 from Pounds 73,950 the year before.
The average rise for employees was 5 per cent, but this included the cost of
increased overtime.
In the construction, motors and industrial materials sectors companies are
still cutting their workforces.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Opposition split on job ban for MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A split emerged among senior opposition politicians yesterday over calls for
a ban on non-parliamentary work by MPs to end the recent stream of
allegations of impropriety.
Amid further allegations about payments to Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury
secretary, and Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, leading
Labour politicians appeared to disagree on restricting MPs to a single paid
job.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, told BBC Radio that MPs should be
prevented from doing anything for money 'except the job that they do through
the ballot box'. MPs should have one duty. 'That duty is to the people who
elect them. If they want to do other things, that's fine . . . but they
should not be paid for them,' he said.
Mr Ashdown's comments were in line with calls by Mr John Prescott, Labour's
deputy leader, on Saturday for MPs to rebuild public confidence in
parliament by restricting themselves to a single paid job.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, told BBC Television that full-time
MPs ought not to take part-time work outside parliament. But he appeared to
distance himself from Mr Prescott.
He said: 'I don't think you can ban second paid jobs. I don't think you can
legislate for people not writing articles or not doing this or that.'
Mr Brown defended Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary,
who declares three business consultancies in the Commons register of MPs'
interests.
He said: 'That is not a second job as such, but there are some people who
actually work more outside the House of Commons than inside, and that's not
anybody on our side.'
Conservative leaders, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, are
opposed to a move towards full-time MPs, which they say would reduce outside
input to political decision making.
Mr Aitken, who has denied media allegations that part of his bill at Mr
Mohamed Fayed's Ritz hotel in Paris was paid by a business associate,
dismissed suggestions in The Observer newspaper that he did not declare a
directorship of a company linked to the Saudi royal family.
The Treasury drew attention to Mr Aitken's earlier statement that he had
never been guilty of any impropriety in the conduct of any of his
responsibilities as an MP.
Lord Callaghan admitted claims in the Mail on Sunday that he failed to
declare a Pounds 12,500 payment from the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International.
But he said the money was intended to pay for a secretary in connection with
a Third World project undertaken after he left the Commons. 'This was
nothing to do with my work as an MP,' he said.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Lib Dems to be cast as party of business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, will use a keynote speech to
the Confederation of British Industry tomorrow to urge business leaders to
reassess their traditional support for the Tories.
In an attempt to set out common ground between the Liberal Democrats and the
business community Mr Ashdown will warn industrialists of the dangers to
business from pressure on the government by its nationalistic right wing.
He will stress the Liberal Democrats' commitments to free markets and
European integration, and challenge industrialists to use their influence
with ministers to counter rightwing hostility to the European Union.
The speech is intended to cast the Liberal Democrats as an alternative party
of business. Mr Ashdown is to mix attacks on the Tories' economic record
with praise for their deregulation of the labour market and industry.
He will urge industrialists to follow the lead set by the Trades Union
Congress, which has opted for links with the Tories and the Liberal
Democrats as well as Labour.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Additional rail links to Heathrow urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, which owns and operates Heathrow airport, hopes to encourage the
creation of additional railway links to Britain's busiest airport.
It will announce tomorrow that it is to spend Pounds 500,000 on a
feasibility study to look at ways of linking the airport with the regions.
BAA has no plans to finance the construction of further rail links or to own
and operate them itself but it wants to encourage the train operating
companies and Railtrack, the state-owned track and signal operator, to do
so.
BAA has contributed to the Pounds 300m cost of building the Heathrow express
link with Paddington station in central London.
It is now looking to establish links with the West Country and Wales, the
Midlands and the north.
South West Trains, which operates services from London Waterloo to
Southampton and Portsmouth, is keen to open a direct link from Waterloo to
Heathrow. This would require only a short link between existing lines and
the airport.
BAA said additional rail links were seen as complementing rather than
replacing motorway connections with the airport. The government is
nevertheless under strong pressure to replace road-building programmes with
spending on public transport.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, is reviewing the government's
road-building programme and cuts in it are expected in the Budget later this
month.
One of the most controversial schemes still in the programme is the widening
of parts of the M25 motorway to up to 14 lanes.
Airport traffic accounts for only a small proportion of vehicles using the
M25 so improved rail links would make little difference to congestion on the
motorway.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Electronic tax return spells end for dreaded form: The
launch of a computer link between accountants and the Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For almost as long as tax has been paid it has been accompanied by the
dreaded tax form. That link may be broken from today with the introduction
by the Inland Revenue of its Electronic Lodgement System (ELS).
The system will link the computer systems of taxpayers' agents, normally
accountants, with those of the Revenue.
The savings in the long-term should be huge. Mr Ian Barlow, tax partner at
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, estimates that it costs Pounds 15 merely to
store an average tax file in a filing cabinet for a year. The likely savings
potential at the Revenue, which dealt last year with 30m returns from
individuals and companies, could also be huge.
Few doubt the long-term logic of electronic tax returns and most admire the
speed with which the Revenue has got to grips with the technology. But the
first phase of the system illustrates some potential problems.
Paper is proving resilient to change. Until later this month, when changes
are expected to be announced in the Budget, a duplicate paper tax process
must run in tandem with the new system. Later that may go - but the need for
a signed authorisation from the taxpayer may persist.
Joining the system is also proving expensive. While the Revenue is paying
for most of the transmission costs, the Big Six accountancy firms are aware
that while the capital costs of starting up may be small the investment in
time is considerable.
For smaller firms the expense rises proportionately. One smaller firm, HW
Fisher, has been included in the pilot scheme to help judge the issues. The
Revenue estimates the first year cost as Pounds 750, but this presumes that
the smaller firm has a relatively expensive personal computer facility
already in place. Given that the system is voluntary, there seems to be
little reason for smaller agents take part.
Accountants are not the only agents with doubts. The personal tax
sub-committee of the British Bankers' Association believes its members will
join an ELS to carry its existing tax return business. But it sees no future
for a high-volume business based on high-street banks.
Mr John Whiting, tax partner with Price Waterhouse and chairman of the
business forum for ELS, is well aware that the business argument has yet to
be won. He believes greater incentives need to be found to get accountants
and the public to file electronically.
In New Zealand, where electronic lodgement operates, 80 per cent of
taxpayers get refunds within 14 days when using the electronic system. Paper
returns earn refunds in two to three months. The UK system will not contain
the same rewards.
'We do need to incentivise our system,' said Mr Whiting. The forum is
putting together a 'shopping list' of possible options to make it worthwhile
for accountants to enter a fully fledged system.
But the Big Six are taking part in the pilot scheme, providing some proof
that the long-term benefits of moving to the system outweigh the short-term
costs. Negotiation may be needed in the next year but the outcome seems
certain.
Accountants do not see the system as a threat to their jobs - quite the
reverse. Proficiency in filing in a tax form on-screen, once a year, will
not come easily and accountants, working with volume, are well placed to
pick up the business.
The revenue envisages that some taxpayers may one day file their returns
from home but others will transfer the information to a disk and take it to
an agent - or even to a central 'tax shop' or service point in a Post
Office.
But for the Revenue, and therefore the taxpayer, the great prize is likely
to be increased accuracy in tax returns and a big cut in the time spent
correcting errors on hand-written forms.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Scott extends Iraq arms inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Justice Scott is investigating defence contracts linked to the
controversial Al Yamamah defence package with Saudi Arabia as part of his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Among the contacts with Saudi Arabia being examined is one involving a
British defence company. Whitehall documents made available to the inquiry
show that a contract with the company for the supply of shells may have been
re-routed to Iraq in breach of official government guidelines.
The judge's efforts to establish whether Saudi Arabia was being used as a
diversionary route are believed to have been hampered by the lack of
conclusive evidence among thousands of Whitehall documents which have been
made available to him.
It emerged earlier this year that Saudi Arabia was under no obligation to
give details of the end-users of defence equipment supplied by the UK under
the Al Yamamah deal.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, then defence procurement minister, said in reply to a
written parliamentary question that defence exports under the deal had
'Crown status' in common with all government defence exports and were
'therefore not subject to export licensing requirements'.
Mr Mark Thatcher, son of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, has
been linked to the Al Yamamah deal but the judge does not plan to call him
as a witness. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, secretary to the Scott inquiry,
said: 'No evidence made available to us links Mark Thatcher to Iraq.'
The apparent loopholes in the UK licensing regime are believed to be one of
the factors prompting the judge to seek proposals for reform of Britain's
export procedures.
The first and only part of the judge's final report to be completed so far
is one covering the UK's export control system, which the judge considers
questionable both in terms of efficiency and democratic accountability.
He has sent copies of this section of his report to the Department of Trade
and to Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Agencies set up travel brand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 600 independent travel agents are today adopting a common brand,
making them the UK's biggest grouping of travel retailers after Lunn Poly.
The retailers, all members of the National Association of Independent Travel
Agents, will display the brand Advantage Travel Centres alongside their
existing names.
The move follows concern among smaller companies about the growth of big
travel retailers and their links with leading tour operators.
The two biggest travel retailers, Lunn Poly and Going Places, are owned by
the two leading tour operators, Thomson and Airtours respectively. Lunn Poly
has 742 shops and Going Places has 562.
The Office of Fair Trading said in August that the links between big tour
operators and travel agents did not restrict consumer choice or prevent
smaller companies from selling holidays.
But small travel agency companies have continued to argue that it is
difficult for them to match the advertising budgets of big companies. They
have also said big tour operators have supported their affiliated travel
agents during discount campaigns, when retailers forfeit their commission.
Independents have found it difficult to match these discounts.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Welsh farmers to resist aid cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh farmers will this week try to convince MPs that the way of life of
many rural producers will be threatened if government aid is cut for the
third successive year.
Mr Evan Wilson of the National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers are often
accused of whingeing, but I honestly believe that a number of hardships will
be created if this aid is cut, with many rural people asking themselves:
'Are we able to carry on farming?' '
Farmers fear that the Pounds 105m paid in Hill Livestock Compensatory
Allowances will be trimmed in this year's Budget. The subsidy, paid to
67,000 farmers in difficult areas covering half the UK's farmland, is one of
few agricultural support payments which is wholly at the government's
discretion.
The government has said that higher subsidies from Brussels, which account
for about Pounds 400m to hill live-stock farmers, should compen-sate for
cuts in UK aid.
Mr John Lloyd Jones, union chairman in Wales, said lamb losses had averaged
Pounds 2,500 for each upland or hill farm after this year's wet spring.
Official figures are likely to show that farm earnings are down about 20 per
cent from last year, which was a good one for British farmers following the
devaluation of sterling. Hill farmers are still quitting at a rate of about
5 per cent a year.
In a recent speech to Welsh farmers, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture
minister, hinted that the allowances could come under pressure in the next
public-spending round. He said: 'The government needs to consider very
carefully the priority it can afford to give to HLCAs amongst the many other
legitimate claims upon taxpayers' money.'
Mr Lloyd Jones said he wanted the government to restore cuts made in the
subsidy in previous years.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Industry backs single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior businesspeople yes-terday came out strongly in favour of a European
Union built on the disciplines of the single market.
They dismissed the suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor, at the
Tory party conference that the UK could withdraw from the EU.
Results of a survey of more than 200 chief executives and chairmen,
published at the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry
in Birmingham, were a sharp rebuff to Tory Euro-sceptics.
Government moves on the development of the EU have been made with ministers
wary of the responses of Euro-sceptics, who are numerous enough to deprive
the Tories of their parliamentary majority.
The survey showed that 58 per cent of the business leaders supported an EU
based on the single market, with freedom for member states to adopt other
common policies according to their circumstances.
Another 29 per cent went further than that, wanting member states to set
common policy objectives but to retain their flexibility about the timing of
adoption.
Mr Davies said the poll showed business 'is comfortable about economic and
monetary union as long as it is properly planned'. Monetary union is
anathema to Conservative opponents of the EU.
For 28 per cent of the business leaders a single currency is necessary to
the successful long-term working of the single market. For 56 per cent a
single currency is a long-term help, but not a necessity.
While the CBI has been seeking to stiffen the government's European sinews,
business leaders have said they are not getting the full benefits of the
single market. They want more deregulation, less interference in competition
from state subsidies, the extension of the single market to the energy and
telecommunications sectors and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Employers urged to stamp out workplace bullying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The white-collar MSF union will today call for measures to deal with
workplace bullying by establishing counselling for victims and disciplinary
procedures, Motoko Rich writes.
According to a recent survey up to 78 per cent of employees have witnessed
workplace bullying and 51 per cent have been victims.
The union defines bullying as an 'abuse of power', but differentiates
bullying from harassment, which it says is normally 'based on race or sex'.
It adds that there is very little legal redress for victims and advises them
to keep records of any incidents.
The union will campaign for employers to recognise bullying as a serious
problem and to support staff through complaints and disciplinary procedures,
and counselling for both victims and bullies.
The Health and Safety Executive said it was preparing guidance for managers
on stress in the workplace which highlights the importance of providing
complaints procedures for victims of bullying.
It added: 'Where an individual employee flags up a case of bullying it
should be taken seriously by the management. Bullying could affect an
individual's mental or physical health.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Weaker car sales 'hit credit growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weaker new-car sales slowed down the growth of consumer credit in September,
a report by the Finance &amp; Leasing Association shows today.
Finance for new cars fell 2 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Pounds 333m
in September and by 56 per cent on a month-on-month basis. The same factor
is likely to affect next month's consumer credit figures - the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Friday that new car registrations
fell 3 per cent last month compared with October last year, with a reduction
in sales to private buyers the main factor behind the fall.
Total consumer credit in September nonetheless increased by 24 per cent
year-on-year to Pounds 1.55bn. Rises of more than 30 per cent were
experienced in the first half of this year. Store cards were up 48 per cent
compared with September last year. Personal loans increased 37 per cent
year-on-year in but were 1 per cent down from the August level.
Mr David Hardisty, Finance and Leasing Association chairman, said that
although consumers were spending in the high street they were 'thinking long
and hard' about bigger purchases such as cars and houses.
Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, says in the bank's
quarterly economic review today that consumer spending is likely to grow
between 1 per cent and 2 per cent next year - lower than in the last two
years.
He says the economic recovery should continue well into the medium term in
spite of the relative weakness of consumer spending, the possibility of
interest rate rises and the predicted absence of significant net tax cuts in
this month's Budget. Very rapid growth in consumer spending would threaten
to produce an increase in inflation and put the sustainability of the
medium-term recovery at risk.
He says the favourable forecast results from the increasing strength of
exports, higher investment levels and an inflation rate not seen for almost
30 years. Strong exports next year would underpin a strong recovery, and
lead to a 'virtual elimination' of the balance of payments deficit.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Cabinet set to endorse Pounds 4bn spending curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cabinet will tomorrow seek to head off rightwing anger about the Post
Office debacle by endorsing deep cuts in public spending at a special
meeting.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to put forward plans for a
reduction of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn in the government's control
total for 1995-96.
A second cabinet meeting has been scheduled for Thursday in case agreement
proves difficult.
Senior ministers believe that the cuts will go some way to mollifying
rightwing backbenchers who were angered by the cabinet's decision to
postpone Post Office privatisation because of opposition from a group of
mainly leftwing rebels.
Rightwing backbenchers have demanded cuts of as much as Pounds 7bn to pave
the way for tax cuts next year, which many believe are essential if the
Conservatives are to win the next general election.
The case for deep cuts in nominal spending has also been strengthened by an
unexpectedly rapid fall in underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest
payments, since Mr Clarke's last Budget in November last year.
That Budget forecast underlying inflation of 3.25 per cent in the current
quarter.
Instead, it fell to a 27-year low of 2 per cent in September and has been
below 3 per cent for 12 months.
As a result Mr Clarke will be able to tell the cabinet that deep cuts in
nominal spending are essential to maintain the confidence of the financial
markets in the government's continuing commitment to sound public finances.
Goldman Sachs, the US-owned merchant bank, has calculated that the
chancellor must cut the 1995-96 control total, which excludes some
recession-related social security spending, by Pounds 5bn to Pounds 258bn
merely to prevent spending rising in real terms.
General government spending, which includes unemployment and other social
security benefits, will also fall sharply because of the decline in
unemployment caused by the stronger-than-expected economic recovery.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, is believed to have
encountered fewer difficulties than usual in the annual round of public
spending negotiations with ministers.
However Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has resisted pressure
for big cuts in the Pounds 8.8bn housing benefit budget, which he believes
would have to be restructured to yield significant savings.
Some senior Conservatives are pressing the chancellor to cut taxes on the
poor, especially pensioners, to offset the impact of Pounds 5bn in fresh
taxes on fuel and services announced last year to take effect in April.
Others are pressing the chancellor to announce tax cuts in a special
mini-Budget next spring rather than waiting until November.
Mr Clarke has said he will not cut taxes until it is prudent to do so.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Business rate rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rating experts are expecting Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to announce
an increase in the uniform business rate in his Budget on November 29.
The new rate, with an assessment of the rateable value for individual
properties, based on commercial rents, will determine how much businesses
will pay in the five years from April 1 1995.
While rents have risen in most areas since the last revaluation five years
ago, large falls in London and a conservative approach by local valuation
offices - to reduce the number of successful appeals - are likely to result
in a lower average rateable value.
If this proves to be correct the chancellor will have to increase the rate
from this year's level of 42.3p in the pound to maintain the amount raised.
The government has said that it does not intend to increase the overall
burden of taxation but regional changes in rents in the past five years mean
that the distribution will change dramatically.
The chart (above) is based on rental value data for 50 towns in England and
Wales and assumes that the chancellor sets a rate of 43.5p in the pound.
Mr Brian Hardy, rating partner at Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, said
that rates on the best City offices could fall from Pounds 25 a sq ft to
Pounds 10 or less.
Office occupiers in Birmingham are likely to see rates double to Pounds 16 a
sq ft.
The swings for retail and industrial occupiers are likely to be less severe
because rents have risen less.
The government has said that increases will be phased, so that rates bills
will not rise by more than 20 per cent a year in real terms.
It is not clear how quickly businesses with lower rateable values, mostly in
London, will be allowed to feel the benefit.
Even if reductions are phased over two or three years, falling rates are
likely to boost the City office market by reducing the overall cost of
occupying space.
Regional centres are not expected to suffer, because rates are a much
smaller proportion of overall occupancy costs.

FT  07 NOV 94 / TUC demands Pounds 1bn boost for employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should spend Pounds 1.15bn on measures to cut unemployment,
raising the money required from the abolition of tax relief on
profit-related pay schemes and a crackdown on tax evasion, the Trades Union
Congress says in its Budget submission published today.
The submission represents a significant shift in union thought, with its
emphasis on the theme of 'making benefits work for the unemployed'. It has
tried to break from previous practice by not drawing up a list of demands
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would dismiss. The TUC is trying to
exercise an influence by suggesting measures which would go with, rather
than against, the grain of government policy.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said that unions shared the views of
the chancellor and the Confederation of British Industry, that 'the welfare
state should be helping the unemployed into jobs and training'.
The TUC proposals include calls for:
A reduction in the poverty and unemployment trap caused by the loss of
benefit as earnings rise.
A cut in the tax rates on workers earning more than Pounds 57 a week by the
abolition of the 2 per cent National Insurance entry fee.
A reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions as an incentive
to create more low-paid jobs.
The introduction of a training levy on all employers with lower National
Insurance contributions for those achieving Investors in People status.
The provision of subsidies for employers to take on long-term jobless.
The submission quotes pointedly from Mr Clarke's Mais lecture earlier this
year, in which he said a strong welfare state could 'complement, not hinder,
flexible markets by reducing fear of change and opposition to it'.
Mr Monks said: 'We have presented him with a mutually reinforcing package of
proposals that the present government could implement.'
Other proposals include: a Pounds 300m increase in funding of income support
and family credit; Pounds 750m more for child benefit which would remain
available for all families; Pounds 100m for higher benefits for those on
training programmes, as well as stabilising public investment at its present
levels as a share of national income. The last would provide an extra Pounds
12bn over three years, creating 300,000 jobs, the TUC said.
Meanwhile, in an interview on GMTV, Mr Monks eased union pressure on Labour
to commit itself to a minimum wage of more than Pounds 4 an hour. Mr Monks
backed the long-standing formula of Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
that the level of the the minimum wage should be set 'in the light of the
economic circumstances at the time'.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Help for long-term unemployed urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Adam Smith Institute, the independent free-market research group, calls
today for measures to create work for the long-term unemployed.
It suggests that they should be exempt from paying tax and National
Insurance for two years after they secure work. The institute also calls for
the creation of 'green-light zones or estates' for two years in inner
cities, where companies with an annual turnover of Pounds 500,000 or less
could establish themselves without being subject to planning permission or
other regulations. It says this would create jobs in areas such as retail
distribution and mini-cab services.
It adds: 'These measures will provide a rung to help the long-term
unemployed and economically deprived areas to climb up into the normal
wage-earning and productive economy.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Labour outlines shadow Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday fore-shadowed an alternative Budget designed to rebuild the
economy and ease the impact of tax increases on less well-off people.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the alternative Budget would
demonstrate how the government could avoid implementing the second phase of
the increase in value added tax on domestic fuel, which is planned for
April.
He said the increase in VAT from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent could be
replaced by revenue raising from several other sources, including a windfall
levy on the 'excess profits' of the regional electricity companies.
Mr Brown said the companies' forecast profit of Pounds 3.5bn on the sale of
the National Grid was an example of how 'some people are making windfall
bonuses at the expense of pensioners and others'.
Mr Brown told BBC Television that the alternative Budget would include a
building programme financed by the release of capital receipts from council
house sales held by local authorities.
He said other measures would include:
An energy-efficiency programme, intended to create employment for building
workers, which would be self-sustaining in the long term.
A training programme for the unemployed.
A National Insurance holiday for employers prepared to employ the long-term
unemployed. A review of childcare costs and social security benefits to help
people back to work.
Mr Brown said: 'We need a programme to rebuild Britain. You can't do this
unless you recognise that there is a huge problem which is costing us . . .
billions of pounds in unemployment and social security benefits.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Lenders warn on mortgage aid cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mortgage lenders are today stepping up their campaign against the prospect
of cuts in government home-loan assistance for people on income support by
identifying those who would be hit.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, building societies
and other lenders, says that the effect of cuts would be to increase
mortgage arrears and repossessions.
On the basis of speculation that the top limit for which a home loan would
be eligible for the state payments might be cut from Pounds 125,000 to
Pounds 90,000, the lenders conclude that more than 200,000 mortgage-holders
would run a higher risk of having their homes repossessed.
It has already warned that if the government chooses one of the other
options being considered - basing income-support payments on a 'standard'
interest rate which is less than the mortgage interest due - then lenders
will not keep to the deal agreed with the government almost three years ago
to help solve the problem.
It says this would lead to greater pressures on the social housing budget,
affecting both the Department of Social Security and the Department of the
Environment.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Free trade deal near between Turkey, Israel

<TEXT>
Ms Tansu Ciller, the prime minister of Turkey, said in Jerusalem at the
weekend that a free trade agreement between Israel and Turkey, held up by
opposition from the Israeli textile industry, would be signed before the end
of the year.
She said it would complement other bilateral agreements to prevent double
taxation, guarantee and protect investments and to open up the capital
markets of the two countries. During her two-day visit to Israel Mc Ciller
discussed a range of multi-million projects in telecommunications, energy,
water and military co-operation in construction of the F-16 Phantom fighter
jet.
In Gaza Ms Ciller promised to help finance Palestinian projects including
the construction of housing, a port and international airport. Turkey has
promised the Palestinian self-rule authority a Dollars 50m (Pounds 30.4m)
package of project credits and a Dollars 2m grant.
Ms Ciller's visit was marred, however, by political controversy after she
visited Orient House, the Palestinian headquarters in Israeli-occupied Arab
East Jerusalem. The Israeli cabinet yesterday criticised the visit and the
barring by Palestinian security men of Israeli bodyguards accompanying Ms
Ciller. Palestinians claimed the visit had bolstered their claims to
Jerusalem as the future capital of a Palestinian state.
Ms Ciller's visit, the first to Israel by a prime minister of predominantly
Moslem Turkey, is expected to strengthen growing economic ties between the
two states and boost moves towards regional integration.
Israeli tourism to Turkey has more than doubled this year. In the first nine
months about 250,000 Israelis visited Turkey compared with 110,000 for the
whole of 1993. Turkey, Israel and Egypt have joined together to promote
tourism in the Eastern Mediterranean Tourist Association.
The volume of trade has also increased from Dollars 93m in 1992 to Dollars
226m last year. Officials said Israel-Turkey trade had considerably expanded
in the first nine months of 1994 although no figures were available.
Ms Ciller signed agreements pledging Israel and Turkey to integration in a
regional communications system based on fibre optics and to linking
electricity grids. Ms Ciller also discussed a deal between the Turkish and
Israeli defence industries worth several hundred million dollars for Israel
to supply avionics for Turkey's F-16 production line.
The two countries discussed a long-term project for Turkey to export its
surplus water to the region which drains into the Mediterranean.
Ms Ciller also said her government was firmly committed to the 'new Middle
East' and a future Middle East common market, and pledged to participate in
and finance the Middle East development bank agreed in Casablanca last week.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said Turkey could serve as a
bridge between Israel and the Arab and Moslem world.
In Cairo yesterday, where Ms Ciller continued her tour, Egyptian prime
minister Atef Sedki said Egypt hoped to strengthen existing co-operation
with Turkey and extend trade worth about Dollars 350m annually. He said oil
and gas were the two main areas for increased co-operation.

FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bank urges urban clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has urged China to impose user fees to improve urban
environmental services and to hit industrial polluters with much tougher
penalties or risk a crisis in towns and cities.
A bank study also reported alarming negligence in the handling of hazardous
waste, saying there was no adequate monitoring of the storage of 50m tonnes
of waste a year. In Urban Environmental Pollution*, the bank said that China
'has an urgent need to reorient the provision of urban environmental
services toward the market economy'.
The release of the study coincides with growing alarm internationally over
the environmental costs of China's explosive economic growth. Real gross
domestic product growth for the past two years exceeded 13 per cent. The
bank identified pollution caused by emerging rural manufacturers - the
fastest growing sector of the economy - as a significant threat to China's
already overburdened environment.
It noted that in 1980, when the environmental regulatory system was imposed,
these rural enterprises accounted for less than 10 per cent of industrial
ouput, but that had jumped by 1992 to 36.8 per cent and was still growing.
The study said it was especially worrying these often small-to-medium sized
enterprises had avoided many of the regulatory restraints that applied to
state-owned-enterprises, and the 'regulation problem can no longer be
ignored'.
Among other recommendations were that China:
Increase the financial and social cost of violating environmental standards.
Enact and enforce hazardous waste legislation.
Charge tariffs for water supply, waste water treatment and solid waste
disposal that encourage careful use.
The World Bank, in its plea for stiffer penalties to deter widespread
flouting of environmental standards, said Chinese companies would have 'no
economic incentive to improve pollution control efficiency unless the
expected cost of violations is raised through substantially higher fines and
more frequent monitoring'.
The bank urged that draft legislation which gives environmental protection
bureaux regulatory authority over hazardous wastes should be implemented
immediately.
'No agency is responsible for hazardous waste monitoring and, as a result,
violations become known only after an accident results in injury or
immediate economic loss,' the study said.
'In 1991, 2,800 recorded pollution accidents resulted in nearly 1,900
injuries. But these numbers pale in comparison to the potential damage that
could be done to the ambient environment and human health by hazardous waste
pollution.'
The study identified sewerage and waste water treatment as another huge
burden on the state, resulting in contaminated groundwater and polluted
urban surface water across the country.
'Nearly 40 per cent of urban China is unserved by sewers, with waste water
going directly into lakes and rivers . . . only 4.5 per cent of municipal
waste water flows receive treatment of any kind.'
The study, in its conclusion, argued strongly that increasingly affluent
urban consumers were 'well positioned to absorb both the indirect and direct
costs of an improved environment'. 'While the imposition of user fees may be
politically difficult, city leaders must recognise that the . . . current
choice to rely on indirect payments leads to excess demand, on the one hand,
and an inability to meet needs, on the other.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / China turns up pressure in Gatt talks: Denying access to
trade body could turn Beijing into wild gorilla, official warns

Denying China access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade could
turn the country into a '900lb gorilla' at large in the world trading
system, a senior Chinese official warned at the weekend.
Professor Chu Xiangyin, dean of the School of International Trade and
Economics, told the official Business Weekly newspaper that it would 'do no
good for anyone' for China to be excluded from Gatt and its successor World
Trade Organisation (WTO).
He said large US companies would be hurt by China's exclusion since their
investments would be afforded better protection under Gatt rules. China
regards the US as the main stumbling block to its Gatt ambitions.
Statements at the weekend by the professor and by a senior Chinese trade
official indicate a tougher Chinese stance on Gatt accession, coinciding
with the last phase of difficult negotiations.
China has been negotiating Gatt issues bilaterally. The Gatt working party
on China is expected to resume discussions in Geneva later this month for a
final push on Beijing's application to rejoin.
Both US and European Union officials say China has 'some way to go' before
satisfying Gatt market liberalisation requirements. Ms Charlene Barshefsky,
an assistant US Trade Representative, said last month that Beijing needed to
'step on the gas pedal' to become Gatt-consistent in time for the planned
birth of the WTO on January 1.
US officials want firmer commitments from China on tariff cuts, phasing out
of non-tariff barriers and access for service organisations. The US is also
demanding concrete action against widespread abuses of intellectual property
rights, including counterfeiting of compact discs and computer software.
One of China's top Gatt negotiators, called, in a newspaper interview, for
'high-level, strategic support and foresight' from the US over the issue.
'The US should take stock of its medium and long-term commercial benefits in
China, not just the short-term ones,' he said.
He urged US officials to give what he described as 'earnest consideration to
three key questions.' These were: Is China's Gatt accession good for trade
liberalisation advocated by the the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum
(Apec)? Is Gatt membership good for promoting China's reforms? And should
China be brought within the new multilateral trading system from the
beginning?'
Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, are scheduled to meet in Jakarta on November 12 during the
Apec forum for what is expected to be crucial discussions on Gatt issues.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Oman warned: cut spending or face economic upheaval: World
Bank spells out harsh realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial policies being pursued by Oman, whose political and economic
stability is vital for the west's oil supplies coming from the Gulf through
the Strait of Hormuz, are unsustainable, the World Bank warns in a recent
study.
Many of Oman's underlying structural economic weaknesses are shared by its
neighbours and partners in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC): Bahrain,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE. While the last three, which hold 40
per cent of the world's known oil reserves, are not faced with the same
immediate and critical choices as Oman, thanks to their larger 'cushion' of
capital derived from their far greater oil reserves, all six share the same
type of hereditary and autocratic monarchical government systems.
Instability in one could quickly spread to one or more of the others.
The bank is particularly severe on the scale of Oman's repeated budget
deficits, current expenditure trends and the decline in investment, all of
which feature - sometimes to a chronic extent - in the other five GCC
countries. If these and other problems are not corrected, and the reforms
proposed ignored, Oman is heading for a 'a major economic and social
upheaval' as the oil and gas era comes to an end and Omanis are 'forced to
give up accustomed standards of consumption'.
Researched by a team of five in January and February 1993, the 224-page
report was completed at the end of last May and subsequently made public 'in
accordance with the World Bank's policy on disclosure'.
The report amounts to a swingeing indictment of the Omani government's
management of the economy, particularly over the last 10 years, when many
key ministers have held the same jobs. The bank's analysis also represents a
comprehensive rebuke to officials at all levels who have developed the
'plausible and positive platitude' almost to a fine art form, even when
confronted with unpleasant realities.
'Oman's oil and gas wealth, being depletable, is analogous to a large
inheritance . . . Oman, like most neighbouring oil and gas producers, is
currently spending an excessive proportion of the proceeds of extraction on
current consumption. In other words it is consuming its capital at a rapid
rate,' the bank says.
The main problems identified by the bank include:
A persistent top-heavy government role in the economy;
State budgets over-stretched by bloated recurrent expenditures, notably on
defence and internal security (among the highest in the world with an
average 33 per cent of budget expenditure for the last 14 years and now 23
per cent of GDP), and civil service salaries; Persistent and rising
government-encouraged public consumption trends and a lack of domestic
public savings;
The lack of a consistent foreign and domestic investment strategy for when
oil reserves taper off;
An overvalued real exchange rate in relation to what would be consistent
with higher (and more desirable) national savings rates;
Failure of efforts to diversify into manufacturing and other non-oil
industries because of current public expenditure/savings policies;
Misuse of the state's reserve and contingency funds;
Lack of appropriate tax structure and rates and realistic charges for public
services;
Ill-conceived notions about the role and cost of expatriate labour, and the
consequent market distortions caused by government efforts to force private
sector companies to employ nationals at uneconomic rates;
Failure to alert Omanis to the reality of the country's fiscal position, to
the inadequate rate of saving, and to their own unrealistic consumption and
employment expectations;
Bureaucratic inertia and lack of financial discipline by ministers over
their own budget allocations;
The absence of healthy competition in the private sector caused by
entrenched monopolistic habits in the public and private sectors;
Out-of-date and cumbersome legal frameworks;
Lack of a self-sustaining private sector and an investment framework to
attract foreign capital;
Lack of a role for private banks in medium- and long-term financing;
Too great an emphasis on higher education at the expense of primary and
secondary schooling;
Need for more entrepreneurial, competitive and less 'rent-seeking' (cash
income for no effort and minimal risk) attitudes among nationals.
For each of the main problem areas, the bank sets out two sets of scenarios:
a 'base case', assuming neither big changes in government policies nor
unforeseen external shocks; and a 'reform case', where the bank's detailed
proposals to reverse the deficit trend are acted on. Some of the assumptions
under the reform scenario could be faulted for being too optimistic, but
even the most optimistic 'base case' models give cause for gloom.
Observers say the growing incidence of some of these structural economic
weaknesses, and the concomitant political risks which the governments of
Oman and Saudi Arabia were courting by ignoring them, had a lot to do with
protests which led to arrests of extremists last summer.
Although oil prices have recovered from the lows of 1986 and 1988, they have
remained, apart from a brief period during the latest Gulf war, below
Dollars 18 a barrel, the bank points out. 'Even now, the (Omani) government
has made only a partial expenditure adjustment to the stagnation in its oil
revenues. In consequence, its financial position has deteriorated and
continues to do so.'
This, the report says, 'is apparent in an almost unbroken string of deficits
since 1981 (an annual average deficit of Dollars 871m or 23.4 per cent
annually over budget revenue during the 11-year period); declining
contributions to the State General Reserve Fund (SGRF); a substantial rise
in external debt; increased recourse to borrowing from the domestic private
sector; a massive, recent accumulation of negative changes in the
government's accounts; and the virtual disappearance of net government
financial reserves.
The deficits have been the result of an exceptionally high level of defence
and national security expenditures, coupled with continued strong growth in
civil recurrent expenditures. The use of the SGRF as an oil revenue
stabilisation fund has pre-empted its potential as a vehicle for long-term
public savings and investment.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes To The Polls: Republican governors on the charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton spent years as governor of Arkansas, and he often
looks happiest when he is discussing policy with his former colleagues in
the National Governors Association.
But the club may be a little less friendly after the elections tomorrow,
with Republican candidates poised to make a significant dent in the
Democrats' long dominance of state politics.
It is not just in the congressional elections that Democratic incumbents are
threatened with dismissal by a disgruntled voting public. Prominent
Democrats such as Governor Lawton Chiles in Florida, Governor Ann Richards
in Texas and Governor Zell Miller in Georgia are in grave danger of losing
their bids for re-election, while Republican Governor Pete Wilson, once a
prime target for Democrats, now seems much safer in California.
In New York, Governor Mario Cuomo now seems better placed to win a fourth
term in office as his Republican challenger, Mr George Pataki, loses steam.
But the Democrats still face the alarming possibility that they could wake
up on Wednesday morning controlling only New York and North Carolina among
the 10 largest states.
In all, 22 incumbent governors are running for re-election tomorrow, and
elections are also being held in 14 more states, many of which allow only
one or two terms as governor.
With the exception of Arizona and Maine, all the states which seem likely to
change hands are held by Democrats. Some pollsters believe the Republicans
could end up with more governorships than the Democrats  - which they last
did in 1970.
Low turnout among Democratic voters is also expected to bring Republican
gains in the state legislatures. In the 10 biggest states, Republicans
already control six state senates and need to pick up only one more seat to
win control in Florida. They trail by a much bigger margin in the lower
state chambers, but seem sure to take over the Michigan House.
And the vote-drawing power of Governors John Engler of Michigan and George
Voinovich of Ohio, both cruising to easy re-election, is expected to provide
a strong boost to Republican candidates for open Senate seats in both
states.
State governments are not only the 'laboratories of democracy', as Mr
Clinton and most other US politicians are fond of saying, in echo of Justice
Louis Brandeis; they are also formidable political power bases.
Governors can be a president's most potent allies in lobbying their state
congressional delegations in favour of legislation.
They could also be a crucial source of strength for presidential candidates
in 1996. It is certainly possible to win in any state without the governor's
help - Mr Clinton won California in 1992 despite Governor Wilson's backing
for former President George Bush.
But most state governors control their state party machinery, and this can
be critical in primaries - as then vice-president George Bush found in New
Hampshire in 1988, when Governor John Sununu rescued his candidacy after he
had been thrashed by Senator Bob Dole in the Iowa caucus.
All is not yet lost for the Democrats. Besides Mr Cuomo, who trailed his
Republican opponent for months but recently seems to have opened a lead in
the opinion polls of as much as 16 percentage points, Governor Roy Romer of
Colorado has also shed earlier worries and established a comfortable margin.
In Florida, Mr Chiles has also fared better in recent weeks against a strong
challenge from Mr Jeb Bush, a Miami businessman and son of former President
Bush, but even though some polls show him with a wafer-thin lead he is still
reckoned to be in the 'endangered' category.
So too is Ms Richards in Texas. Her folksy one-liners and general popularity
in the state have done nothing to shake off the challenge of Mr George Bush,
co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team and another son of the former
president.
Although national trends still seem to favour the Republicans, at the local
level the individual candidate can still be more important.
In Maine, for example, the Senate seat left open by the retirement of
Democratic majority leader George Mitchell appears to be swinging to
Republican Congresswoman Olympia Snowe. But in the election for the
governorship vacated by retiring Governor Jock McKernan, Ms Snowe's husband,
the Republican candidate is running a distant third; if Democrat Joe Brennan
loses, it will be to independent businessman and television presenter Angus
King.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes To The Polls: Despair or joy for hurricane Newt
Gingrich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow could be the greatest day in the political life of Newton Leroy
Gingrich, known as Newt. It could also be the night of his greatest
disappointment.
In the rosy scenario, he could end it Speaker-presumptive of the House of
the Representatives and conceivably with Republican majorities in both
chambers. In the nightmare, he could wind up saddled with the blame for
raising Republican expectations too high and for the commission of grievous
tactical errors that excited the Democrats sufficiently for them to hold on.
Rarely has a party's national campaign been so shaped by a single person as
has this year's midterm effort by the 51-year-old, Pennsylvania-born radical
conservative congressman who has represented Georgia's sixth district, now
encompassing the spreading northern suburbs of Atlanta, since 1979.
Other prominent Republicans have done their bit, but many, like Senators Bob
Dole of Kansas and even Phil Gramm of Texas, have seemed to have at least
half an eye on a still bigger election in 1996 or, schooled in political
pragmatism rather than confrontation, wondered if the party was not going
too far to the right.
Such ambitions and reservations have never clouded Newt Gingrich's mind. An
articulate ideologue by conviction and a guerrilla fighter by nature, he has
always seen the Reagan era as one with much unfinished business and the Bush
and Clinton presidencies as inconvenient interruptions. A political product
of a Congress he professes to despise, he is intent on changing not only its
faces but also its collective mind.
It was Mr Gingrich who first demanded that the midterm elections be turned
not into a series of local battles but first and foremost into a national
referendum on the Clinton presidency. Republican candidates beyond number
have sought to identify their Democratic opponents with Mr Clinton, often
using commercials where a candidate's face metamorphoses into one of the
president.
It was Gingrich, too, who in September trotted out more than 300 Republican
candidates for the House on to the steps of the Capitol to sign the 10-point
'contract with America' - instantly assailed by the wittier Democrats as a
mob-style 'contract on America'.
This committed them to introduce, within 100 days of the convening of the
new Congress, legislation to balance the budget by constitutional amendment,
to establish the budget line item veto (empowering a president to eliminate
any specific item of spending), to limit the terms served in Congress, to
cut taxes, and other items long on the conservative wish-list.
He has never been shy about his purpose or his methods, rarely less so than
in an interview with the Washington Post last month encapsulating the logic
behind the twin strategies.
'We reached two conclusions about May. One was that we might win a majority.
. . the other that the country was going to be so negative about Clinton
that if we went as negative as the country was, we would drive down
participation because people would be sick of the process. And so we
consciously designed the contract around these two observations.'
Dissuading people from voting might seem an odd way to win elections, but
not for a party which normally benefits when the turn-out is low.
Reasonably secure of his own re-election, he has personally visited about
one third of the House's 435 districts in the last two months, energising
Republicans with his own fiery brand of take-no-prisoners oratory.
Not for nothing is he known as Hurricane Newt or his political potion as
containing Eye of Newt.
Yet, until the strategic decisions were taken on this campaign and until he
led the successful Republican attempt to block virtually all that remained
of the Clinton legislative programme, he had sometimes co-operated with the
White House.
Steeped in opposition and obstruction, he will find tomorrow if he also gets
a slice of real power. If he does, his exercise of that authority will make
him either Bill Clinton's worst bete noir or his political saviour or both.
Newt Gingrich would ask for nothing less.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes To The Polls: Democrats on the very brink of
survival - Politics under fire as campaigning comes to a bitter and negative
finale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even if America were a land veritably flowing with milk and honey, President
Bill Clinton and his Democrats would lose seats in tomorrow's congressional
elections. This is how it always is when a new president, regardless of
party or personality, meets the wall of reaction, protest and downright
indifference that characterise his first midterms.
What makes tomorrow important is the prospect of something relatively
unusual happening - a change of power in one, or conceivably both, chambers
of Congress. This has not happened in the House of Representatives since
1954, when the Democratic hegemony was established, and in the Senate since
1986, when the Democrats ended a brief six year Republican interregnum.
The significance of such a change to President Clinton and to the conduct of
US policies at home and overseas can be overestimated. Post-war Republican
presidents have far more often than not been saddled with a Democratic
Congress, yet the country has not always found itself in a state of
paralysis. Many Americans believe there is a natural order to the presidency
resting with one party and the legislature with the other.
Yet the angry tenor of the campaigns now lurching to a bitter and negative
conclusion suggest stirrings in the woodwork far beyond normal political
cut-and-thrust.
Cynicism about government itself and those who work in it has reached a
pitch that dwarfs rational consideration about what it, and they, should be
doing about national problems.
In a sense, it may not matter so much whether Republicans take control of
one or the other chamber than that those who inhabit the next Congress, old
and new members, Republicans and Democrats alike, may have been so scarred
by their confrontation with the electorate that the term 'do nothing
Congress,' so successfully coined by President Harry Truman in the 1948
campaign, may come to be seen as an understatement.
Democratic command of the legislature does hang by a thread. This is most
easily discernible in the 35 more visible races, 22 of them defended by
Democrats, in the 56-44 Democratic Senate than in all 435 House contests,
where the majority party holds a 256-178 edge, with a lone independent (Mr
Bernie Sanders of Vermont).
Needing to lose no more than six seats to retain control, the Democrats seem
certain to drop three - Ohio, Maine and Arizona - and are at severe risk in
as many as 10 more.
They could afford to lose more than six if there are offsetting gains from
Republicans. But local polls, admittedly not always reliable, point to only
one realistic chance, in Minnesota. Once hopeful prospects in Delaware,
Wyoming and Montana now seem longer shots, though one survey last week in
the state of Washington found a surprising surge for Mr Rod Sims, previously
running well behind Mr Slade Gorton, the Republican incumbent. Another
survey found that Mr James Jeffords, a leading party moderate, was not quite
secure in Vermont.
The pundit consensus, for what it is worth, generally hovers around
Republican gains of 5-9 seats, either not quite enough, or just enough. In
the event of a 50-50 tie, the presence of Vice-President Al Gore means the
Democrats retain command of the chamber and its committees, unless Senator
Richard Shelby from Alabama, who often votes with Republicans, can be
persuaded to switch parties.
It is much harder to get a national handle on the House races, where the
Republicans need a 40-seat gain to form a majority in their own right. But
Congressman Newt Gingrich, certain to be the next Republican leader in the
House and, with party control, the next Speaker, is openly talking of
forming new alliances. He wants to link with conservative Democrats from the
south and its borders, giving him de facto, if not de jure, command.
The Democrats started with the assumption that they could lose 25 seats,
greater than the average post-war loss but not by much. Mr Gingrich raised
the stakes by talking about 40 and more, before lowering them somewhat and
focusing on ideological majorities.
It does appear that some apparently very endangered Democratic incumbents,
many of them in their first terms like Pete Strickland in Ohio and Jane
Harman in California, are on the brink of survival. Special interest money
also tends to favour sitting members, with one study last week finding
incumbents with a 15-1 fundraising advantage in House races. Again, the
pundit consensus foresees Republican gains of 25-35 seats.
The obvious Republican advantage is derived in part from the fact that the
midterms always attract a low turn-out - nationally about one-third of
eligible voters. There will be wide variations, depending on the heat
generated by local candidates and issues, but Republicans, more committed if
smaller in numbers, seem more motivated to vote.
A recent Washington Post-ABC poll sought to identify likely voters and found
them evenly split between the two parties. Earlier surveys had actually
found the Republicans ahead, but parity is a plus because, in recent
elections, the Democrats have generally enjoyed about an eight point
advantage.
The impact of the religious right may be more visible in individual contests
like the Senate races in Virginia and Minnesota than nationally. But the
Christian Coalition's get-out-the-vote drive, invariably behind conservative
candidates and causes, cannot be overlooked. This weekend, for example, it
will be distributing across the country no less than 33m 'election guides',
the contents of which have already drawn fire from liberal quarters.
Yet the sad and indelible memory of virtually all the contested campaigns is
that money and negativism have been identified as the keys to electoral
success. The California Senate race between Ms Dianne Feinstein, the
Democratic incumbent, and Congressman Michael Huffington has already set
national records - Dollars 30m and counting - for a single contest, most of
it from the Republican's own pockets. The Robb-North slugfest in Virginia is
not far behind.
It has been hard to find a single campaign in which conventional policy and
social issues have been given an airing in the welter of name-calling.
Discussion of crime - a hot button subject - invariably is reduced to who
would execute murderers first and fastest. Democrats, in particular, have
seemed at a loss to respond, with, perhaps, only Governor Mario Cuomo of New
York secure enough in his own opposition to capital punishment not to bend
with the prevailing tempest.
The most important ballot issue in any state - the Californian proposition
to deny social services to illegal immigrants - is the perfect manifestation
of this public discontent and the consequent search for scapegoats. There is
no doubt that illegal immigration poses costs and problems, but the proposed
solution, probably both illegal and unconstitutional, seems motivated by the
desire to take matters out of the hands of government, state and federal.
The impact of all this, as personal experience and acres of reportage and
polling in the American media attest, is of a polarised electorate genuinely
disgusted with politics in all its manifestations. Yet tomorrow the country
votes and, in January, a new Congress, the result of that exercise of the
franchise, will take office. Regardless of who runs the legislature, no easy
times lie ahead.

FT  07 NOV 94 / The US Goes to the Polls: The showdown in the states
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON
Not since 1860 has a sitting Speaker of the House of Representatives lost an
election, but Tom Foley, whom the Constitution ranks third behind the
president, faces his toughest campaign since winning in 1964. Lawyer George
Nethercutt has benefitted from the national anti-incumbent tide, and the
cash from Republican groups outside the state.
CALIFORNIA
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein was expected to cruise to re-election,
but republican oil millionaire Michael Huffington is running her close after
spending Dollars 16m on television advertising. Feinstein fought back, after
Huffington was hurt by news that he employed an illegal immigrant as a
nanny. Republican Governor Pete Wilson seems set for a second term.
TEXAS
Democratic Governor Ann Richards is still popular, and most voters say she
is doing a good job. But she has faced a tough campaign against Republican
George Bush, another son of the former president, and co-owner of the Texas
Rangers baseball team. However, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is
having no trouble warding off Democrat Richard Fisher.
TENNESSEE
Democrats expected a battle to hold onto the Senate seat vacated by Vice
President Al Gore. Congressman Jim Cooper, best known for his centrist
healthcare reform plan, is trailing Republican lawyer/actor Fred Thompson.
The Democrats are more surprised by the struggle for Senator Jim Sasser, who
won with 65 per cent six years ago.
FLORIDA
Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles was elected to the Florida legislature in
1958 and has not lost an election since, but Jeb Bush has mounted a
ferocious attack. Little divides the two in the polls, but the gulf is wide
on issues such as immigration, crime and education, where Bush stands far to
the right of his father, former President George Bush.
VIRGINIA
He has been convicted of lying to Congress over the Iran-Contra affair and
denounced by fellow Republicans including former President Ronald Reagan,
but Oliver North's Senate campaign rolls on with the backing of the
Christian right wing. Democratic Senator Chuck Robb, once the darling of his
party, has run a lacklustre campaign.
PENNSYLVANIA
Senator Harris Wofford's surprise victory in a 1991 by-election launched the
debate about healthcare reform, but its defeat this year hurt him.
Congressman Rick Santorum is way to the right of most Republicans who have
won in Pennsylvania, but his opposition to gun control and calls for
congressional reform have given him a narrow lead.
NEW JERSEY
Governor Christine Todd Whitman swept New Jersey last year with a promise to
cut taxes, and the Republicans had hoped to repeat her victory in the Senate
election this year. But Democratic Senator Frank Lautenberg seems to have
retaken the lead over Republican Chuck Haytaian.
NEW YORK
Governor Mario Cuomo faces a tough challenge in his bid for a fourth term.
Republican George Pataki has the backing of a powerful political machine but
little support of his own. Cuomo has struck back in recent weeks, however,
winning the endorsement of Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
MICHIGAN
Democrats are on the verge of losing the seat to Spencer Abraham, a former
aide to ex-Vice President Dan Quayle. Abraham appears to hold a narrow edge
over Congressman Bob Carr, whose brand of inside-Washington pork barrel
politics has failed to excite Democratic voters. Abraham is helped by
Republican Governor John Engler's smooth ride to re-election.
MINNESOTA
Republican Senator Dave Durenberger's retirement seemed to offer the
Democrats a good chance of winning a state from their rivals. But most polls
show that Anna Wynia, a left-of-centre state lawmaker, trails Congressman
Rod Grams, a right-winger who has campaigned against congressional
privileges.

FT  07 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Molly a lone voice among
doom-sayers - US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The best antidote to gloom, doom and US media portentousness is called Molly
Ivins, the unreconstructed liberal who writes a column when the mood takes
her out of Austin, Texas. When California got hot under the collar about
illegal immigrants from the south, she wrote that, in her neck of the woods,
no one could find anything wrong with 'Messakins', as Texans call them.
She was again outspoken last week in taking the wind out of the sails of the
ship of heavy analysis about America's electoral agonies. On learning that
the prevailing wisdom is that it is the 'cranky voters', not Washington
politicians, who are to blame, she wrote that 'you could have knocked me
over with Michael Huffington's brain'. The reference was to the Republican
candidate for Senate in California.
However, the unsinkable Molly, even at her most deliciously ironic, is a
minority with few companions. The comics and cartoonists have had their fun
with the likes of Huffington and Oliver North (Republican Senate candidate
in Virginia), but most of the rest of the media have been wringing their
hands and often screwing up their noses before making endorsements.
Clearly partisan publications - the Wall Street Journal on the right, the
New York Times on the centre-left - have taken editorial satisfaction,
respectively, in likely Republican gains generally and the probable
re-election of Mario Cuomo as Democratic governor of New York.
There has been some breaking of type - the liberal Los Angeles Times, which
has made no endorsement in a governor's race since 1970, opting for
Republican Pete Wilson in California, and the Washington Post preferring
Republican Carol Schwartz over the rehabilitated Marion Barry for mayor.
But Boston's leading newspaper, the Globe, did its duty and supported Edward
Kennedy in glowing terms, finding no evidence of a liberal resting on his
laurels. 'Kennedy's pace has only quickened, especially in the last two
years. . . for these reasons - his energy, his focus and his ability - the
Globe endorses his re-election.'
Still, there is nothing like dislike of a candidate to sharpen the leader
writer's pen. The Cincinnati, Ohio, Enquirer said this of the hapless Joel
Hyatt, running for the Senate as a Democrat; he 'is only as deep as a fresh
coat of furniture wax. He comes across like a college student who thinks he
can fake it through finals with a charming smile.'
The other end of the age scale was also on the mind of the Wilmington,
Delaware, News Journal, which was relatively unusual in finding good in both
its Senate candidates before plumping for the return of William Roth, the
73-year old Republican. It acknowledged the senator had slowed down but
wrote, charitably, that 'doesn't mean that we have outlived our usefulness
or that we should be thrown on to the scrapheap.'
But the Burlington, Vermont, Free Press, turned rather savagely on James
Jeffords, one of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate, in endorsing
his opponent, Ms Jan Backus. 'Now, it's sad to say, he has come to typify
what is wrong with Washington; lots of money spent and nothing getting
done.'
Some newspapers found merit in Washington seniority, however. The liberal
Bergen, New Jersey, Record, endorsing Senator Frank Lautenberg, the
Democrat, wrote 'we agree with his philosophy of using the federal
government to solve major domestic problems'. The view of the Courier Post
of Camden, New Jersey, could not have been more different. '(Chuck the
Republican) Haytaian's thrust is right for the '90s. A lot of us are as mad
as hell. We want the government off our backs and the sooner the better.'
Reflections of this view have been the dominant strain in analytical
reportage and punditry. Writing on negative campaigning in the Washington
Post, David Broder, who has rarely seen an election he did not like, wrote
'people are looking for enemies. . . it's that criminal out there, real or
symbolic, that people want to run against rather than run against their
opponent'.
Albert Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, with views never to be confused with
those of his newspaper's leader writers, wrote sadly that 'the one lesson
that should be drawn from this dreary experience - the need to make state
and congressional campaign financing more like the presidential system with
partial public funding - is a non-starter politically.'
But the last word on all this lamentation and navel-gazing should be left
with Molly Ivins. 'What a bunch of chumps, boobs, saps, dolts, clods, goofs,
mutts, jerks, fools and ignorami we all are. I know you're feeling just as
ashamed as I am.'

FT  07 NOV 94 / Strike changes news habits in San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
San Franciscans are getting a taste of the future - at least the future as
predicted by those who believe that the daily newspaper is dying.
Last Tuesday night, 2,600 workers at San Francisco's two leading newspapers,
the morning Chronicle and the afternoon Examiner, went on strike. Most of
their more than 600,000 daily subscribers have been without their daily fill
of a local newspaper.
There is no shortage of news. Local radio and TV stations have taken up the
cause by expanding their regular news coverage. Striking journalists have
made guest appearances on the airwaves to talk about the subjects they
normally write about.
Not to be outdone, the management of the Chronicle and Examiner accelerated
plans to create an on-line news service this week. The Gate, which combines
stories from both papers, was to have been introduced on the Internet, the
computer network, later this month. Instead, it made its debut last week.
The strike is a classic labour dispute about pay, working conditions and job
security. It comes after the newspaper's unionised employees have worked for
a year without contracts.
The Chronicle and Examiner, although separately owned, are both printed and
distributed by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency. The bosses want to
streamline distribution, eliminating 150 drivers and hundreds of 'youth
carriers', the boys and girls who hurl newspapers on to driveways in their
neighbourhoods each day.
Employees object to the cuts and are fighting for a pay rise bigger than the
3.5 per cent increase on offer. Privately, they say that the strike has been
precipitated by fears of 'union busting'.
Resorting to radio is one way around the strike but, as Mr Herb Caen, the
renowned SF Chronicle columnist puts it, the feeling 'isn't the same'. 'You
can't re-read it once, to try to get the meaning, or twice, to look for
typos (and) mistakes. . . In short, it isn't as much fun.'
Mr Caen's column appeared in the San Francisco Free Press, a newspaper
cobbled together by striking journalists using borrowed computers and
telephones. A hundred thousand copies of the Free Press were distributed on
Friday, the newspaper unions claim.
While distribution of the Free Press was limited, several thousand more
readers picked it up via their computers on the Internet.

FT  07 NOV 94 / I did it my way, says Carlos Salinas: Mexican president
tells Damian Fraser law and social security problems are his only regrets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than a month to go before his six-year term as Mexico's president
finishes, Carlos Salinas says he only has two regrets: that he failed to
reform the country's judicial system and to overhaul its near-bankrupt
social security institute.
'I did not have time to carry these reforms out,' he said in an interview in
Los Pinos, the presidential home. The difficult economic situation, partly a
result of the delay in passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
postponed reform of the social security institute, he said.
The murder last year of the Roman Catholic Cardinal of Guadalajara and the
subsequent presidential election campaign, it is understood, put off planned
changes to Mexico's notoriously corrupt and inefficient judicial system.
These regrets aside, Mr Salinas asserts that he would not have done anything
differently. He defends his pro-market economic policies as having laid the
groundwork for sustainable growth, and for beginning to reduce Mexico's
sharp inequalities in income. He argues that the rhythm of political reform
was determined by the need to achieve consensus across the political parties
and avoid instability, but the August presidential election was 'a victory
for democracy'.
One of the three declared candidates to head the incipient World Trade
Organisation, Mr Salinas has the backing of the US, Canada, and all of Latin
America. However, he is reported to have less support than Mr Renato
Ruggiero, the European Union candidate, who has been campaigning more
actively than the Mexican president.
Mr Salinas says that before a decision is taken on the leadership of the WTO
post, more countries should approve the Uruguay Round deal of trade reforms.
'The key question is when will the US Congress ratify the Uruguay Round,' he
says, with the answer in his view depending on the outcome of the US
mid-term elections tomorrow. Anything that puts in doubt the Uruguay Round
would 'open the door to commercial wars, which would be the worse scenario
for the end of the 20th century.'
Mr Salinas is keeping a careful watch on the US elections for another
reason: US-Mexican relations are expected to come under strain if the state
of California approves Proposition 187, which would deny illegal immigrants
non-emergency public services. Mr Salinas reiterated his attack on the
proposition, saying it wrongly blamed migratory workers for California's own
internal problems, and was 'xenophobic'. Mexico's Foreign Ministry is
preparing a series of responses in case the referendum is passed, he says.
Discussing his own legacy, Mr Salinas says economic reform was already well
advanced when he took office, which enabled him to move rapidly in this area
from the moment he was elected president.
Thus his first years in office were characterised by the debt reduction
agreement, sweeping privatisations, economic deregulation, and the decision
to negotiate a free trade agreement with the US and Canada.
By contrast, he implies, Mexico's political system had been touched less by
reform when he took over. 'Generally in Mexico the electoral structure was
arranged, let us say, to guarantee a victory of the PRI,' he says. 'It would
have been very tense' if he had sought to dismantle the old political system
faster. What was important was that he 'succeeded in introducing political
reforms in favour of democracy and pluralism without causing a rupture'.
Mr Salinas accepts that electoral and political reform needs to go further.
He supports making the electoral institute totally independent of the
government. It would 'not be a bad idea' if the opposition was given control
of congressional committees that oversee government spending. He claims, in
an argument that would not convince members of the opposition, that there
has not previously been a consensus on such reforms.
Commenting on the judiciary and social security problems he failed to
tackle, Mr Salinas says it gives him 'great pleasure' that Mr Ernesto
Zedillo, his hand-picked successor, has pledged to address these issues.
Mr Salinas says social security reform will need to address shortage of
funds (the so-called actuary deficit) and separation of the accounts of
those enrolled in the institute. Mr Zedillo has sketched his approach to
judicial reform, which among other changes, would establish a civil service
for judges to encourage professionalism and greater integrity.
While publicly unwilling to admit as much, Mr Salinas is also almost certain
to hand over to Mr Zedillo the problem of how to disarm and integrate into
society the Zapatista rebels in the state of Chiapas.
Mr Salinas promises he will look for a negotiated settlement in Chiapas
until the day he leaves office. But with Zapatistas showing no interest in
talks with the Salinas government, the chances of success are negligible.

guzzlers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss love American cars. The Alps are crowded with Cadillacs,
Cherokees, Mustangs and other strange beasts rarely seen in other European
countries.
In the first nine months of this year, Chrysler - the most successful of the
big three US importers - sold 5,517 vehicles in Switzerland, claiming a 2.5
per cent share of the whole market. General Motors sold 1,774 US imports,
and Ford 860.
In each case, these results are vastly better than in other European
countries. GM, for example, sells more US cars in tiny Switzerland than it
does in Germany or France. The companies sell scarcely any US models in the
UK because they do not make right hand drive models.
It all seems at odds with the charming Swiss preference for things small.
They like nothing better than to put the diminutive suffix 'li' on cherished
things. A child's hand is a Handli; Liechtenstein is a 'Landli'. But a
Chevroletli?
Ask the Swiss or the car companies themselves the reasons for their quirky
taste for American cars, and a variety of answers emerge. All agree that it
is a long tradition, dating back to before the second world war. 'The Swiss
have always liked the US as a country to visit,' offers Mr Roland Husser,
sales manager of Chrysler-Jeep Import Switzerland.
'The ties between Switzerland and North America - both for families and for
businesses - are much stronger than in other European countries,' claims a
General Motors representative.
There are also practical reasons. Switzerland is mountainous. Immediately
after the war, under-powered Renaults, Fiats and Volkswagen 'beetles' had to
struggle over the Alpine passes. Big Oldsmobiles and Buicks with six litre
V8 engines cruised over.
Moreover, petrol prices in Switzerland have always been relatively low, so
the gas guzzling didn't matter. Perhaps most important, Switzerland has
never had a car industry to protect, so import barriers against American
cars are insignificant.
Like many US buyers, the Swiss went off US cars in the 1980s as their
quality standards sagged. Chrysler pulled out of the Swiss market
completely, returning only in 1988.
Today, even though American cars have become much smaller and more difficult
to distinguish from European models, the Swiss have come back to them.
Ironically, this is in part because of the good value they offer, thanks to
the rise in the Swiss franc against the dollar in the past two years.
Also, the US companies had a lead in a couple of the most trendy vehicle
types, such as jeeps and the so-called multi-purpose vehicles (MPV).
Chrysler's Voyager, GM's Pontiac TranSport and Ford's Explorer all do well
among fashion conscious Swiss.
Mr Husser says businessmen and men with large families buy the MPVs, and
they like them loaded with options. Cherokee Jeeps are preferred by 'well
educated males between 40 and 50'.
Like nearly everything in Switzerland, US-made vehicles are more expensive
than at home, usually by about 10 to 15 per cent, according to Mr Husser.
The differential is rather higher these days because of the weakness of the
dollar against the Swiss franc. As a rule, the companies set prices on the
basis of market considerations and do not adjust frequently for exchange
rate changes.
There are good reasons for some price differential - mainly having to do
with transport costs and maintaining a dealer network for a relatively small
market. But it is a fair bet that the companies do very well on their Swiss
business.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary party took an important step
over the weekend in promised internal democratic reforms, when it elected
its candidate for the governor's race in the state of Jalisco by secret vote
in a convention of local party leaders, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico
City.
Mr Eugenio Ruiz Orozco, the senator-elect for the state, won the convention
with more than 1,400 of the nearly 2,000 delegates present. He was backed by
the most important factions within the party, and had been overwhelming
favourite to win the nomination.
However, the fact that four other candidates stood against Mr Ruiz in an
internal poll of chosen delegates was considered an advance. In the past,
the PRI's candidates for senior elective office have usually been picked in
private by the president and a few senior party officials.
Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the incoming president who himself was hand-picked by
President Carlos Salinas, has repeatedly pledged not to interfere in the
nomination of the party's candidates, and to promote a democratic selection
process.
While there were few reports of anomalies in the vote-counting at the
convention, supporters of the second-placed candidate claimed delegates from
the workers' and peasants' sectors had been under pressure to vote for Mr
Ruiz. There had also been complaints that delegate selection was biased in
favour of the winning candidate.
The state election in Jalisco is due in February next year, and is expected
to be a tight race between the PRI and centre-right opposition.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Scharping appeal on Stasi links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats,
has called for a partial amnesty for those who co-operated with former east
Germany's Stasi secret police.
The plea re-opens an issue that has divided east and west Germans and has
pitted east Germans against one another as they come to terms with one of
the most hated and insidious institutions of the communist period.
Mr Scharping said it was time to grant some partial amnesty for former Stasi
employees on the grounds that it was preventing 'inner unification', and
time to rehabilitate some of these people. An amnesty might also have the
effect of diluting support for the PDS, the successor to the former east
German Communist party, which contains former Stasi members.
More than 109,000 people are estimated to have collaborated with the Stasi,
one of the most efficient secret police forces in communist eastern Europe.
A law was passed in December 1991 allowing east Germans access to their
files. It also allows public and private institutions access, to screen
employees.
Mr Scharping's plea was supported by Mr Stefan Heym, the east German writer
and member of the PDS who was recently elected to the Bundestag, or lower
house.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic party and senior
members of the Gauck Commission, the institution responsible for supervising
the files, have opposed any amnesty.
Mr Geiger said there were still more than 400,000 outstanding requests by
individuals wishing to see their files and the commission was receiving
about 500 requests a day. By last April more than 720,000, most of them east
Germans, had applied to see whether their names had appeared on any of the
files.
The material remains politically explosive. Prominent east German
politicians, including Mr Gregor Gysi, parliamentary head of the PDS, are
alleged to have collaborated with the Stasi. Mr Gysi has vehemently denied
these allegations.
Opinion among east Germans remains divided about keeping the files open.

<TEXT>
The three parties in Germany's new coalition government last night agreed on
a series of measures to combat crime but were again unable to reach
agreement about a controversial income tax.
During five hours of talks, which were described as 'extremely difficult',
the coalition agreed to review new laws designed to combat international
crime and to amend them if necessary. However, no new laws were agreed, an
outcome reflecting the resistance of the liberal Free Democratic party
(FDP), which has argued that new legislation alone would not reduce crime
levels.
All three parties also agreed on small changes which will make it easier for
foreigners to receive German nationality.
However, the issue of the solidarity surcharge, a 7.5 per cent income tax
designed to fund investment in eastern Germany, was again postponed until
the next session of talks due to begin tomorrow.
Before yesterday's talks the FDP, which badly needs to show that it has
secured concessions from its coalition partners after its poor result during
the recent elections, said it would insist on a list of criteria which could
be used to decide when the solidarity surchage could be scrapped.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its more
conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), have
so far refused to give way to FDP demands for a deadline by which the tax
would be removed.
Despite differences among the parties, however, it is likely that the talks
will end with a broad-brush agreement, short on commitments, that will
enable the coalition to govern smoothly.
This would also help to ensure that all the coalition's 341 deputies in
parliament would vote to re-elect Mr Kohl in a ballot likely to take place
on November 15. The coalition has a majority of just 10 seats over the
combined opposition.
Some FDP members fear, however, that if the party does not use the present
talks to secure its demands it will have even less leverage once Mr Kohl is
safely re-elected. The final composition of the cabinet will also only be
agreed after the 'chancellor vote'.

Former US President Ronald Reagan has released a handwritten letter
informing Americans that he is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a
progressive neurological disorder involving memory loss and personality
change.
The 83-year-old Republican said he and his wife, Nancy, decided to make the
news public to 'promote greater awareness of this condition' and to
'encourage clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are
affected by it'. No effective drug exists to arrest the mental and physical
decline of the condition. Mr Reagan's letter - a moving farewell to
Americans from the man know as 'the great communicator' - said the disease
imposed a heavy burden on the families of those afflicted. 'I only wish
there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience,' he
said. 'When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face
it with faith and courage. . . I now begin the journey that will lead me to
the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright
dawn ahead.'

Thousands of Venezuelan National Guard soldiers today begin 24-hour patrols
in the country's big cities to check a wave of violent crime that cannot be
controlled by regular police forces alone. The guard, a branch of
Venezuela's armed forces, normally does not appear in such force except
under special circumstances, such as natural disasters, civilian or military
disorders or national elections.
In announcing the new deployment of National Guard patrols, Major General
Rafael Montero Revette, minister of defence, said the operation would be in
effect until the end of December, and guardsmen would work in co-operation
with police forces. 'I want to clarify that the intention is not to
militarise the cities, but to offer better security to the population.' A
recent increase in theft and armed robbery comes as Venezuela struggles with
a deepening economic recession. Official figures put unemployment at 13.5
per cent for the third quarter of 1994.

<TEXT>
Albanians voted yesterday on their first post-Communist constitution after
decades of Stalinist rule, but opponents of the proposed charter said power
would again be too heavily concentrated in one person. President Sali
Berisha, casting his ballot, proclaimed the vote 'the greatest day in
Albania's history'. He has argued the new constitution will help ease the
entry of the country into the continent's mainstream.
The Referendum Central Commission said results would not be released until
tomorrow night, 48 hours after the polls closed. Opponents contend Mr
Berisha would have too much power under the new constitution, which would
give him the right to appoint judges and control the government agenda. They
argue that approving the constitution is parliament's job, but that Mr
Berisha opted for a nationwide referendum because he could not get the
two-thirds majority needed for passage. Observers from the European Union
and the US were in Albania to monitor the vote.

Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's federalist Northern League, yesterday
warned that the party was prepared to use its power in the ruling coalition
to press for political change, once the 1995 budget was approved. 'Without
courage, the League risks being ground down,' he told a League congress.
'The moment has come for courageous decisions. Once a regime is installed,
its difficult to obtain change.'
In a crowd-pleasing speech, aimed as much at reasserting his power within
the party as within the government, Mr Bossi sought a mandate from delegates
to put the government's record on liberalism and federalism under scrutiny.
He also called for the creation of a new liberal-democratic, federalist
alliance, centred on the League and excluding the far-right National
Alliance, currently part of the coalition, and the far left.

The murder at the weekend of South African religious leader Professor Johan

wing may still be active and are now targeting people they regard as
traitors to the Afrikaner people. Prof Heyns, a former moderator of the
Dutch Reformed Church to which the great majority of the country's 3m
Afrikaners belong, was shot dead in his Pretoria home on Saturday night
while playing cards with his family. He was regarded as the driving force
behind the church's decision in 1989 to reverse its long-standing support
for apartheid and brand it a sin.
Political and religious leaders yesterday paid tribute to Prof Heyns's
contribution to effecting South Africa's political transformation. 'He had a
major part in preparing the church and the Afrikaner community for change,'
said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Chirac promises Emu referendum

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of France's governing RPR Gaullist party, said
last night that if he became president he would put French membership of any
European monetary union to a referendum. Speaking on television three days
after he became the first mainstream French politician to declare formally
his candidacy in next spring's election to the Elysee, Mr Chirac said: 'I
only want France to enjoy the same rights as Britain and Germany, which have
already announced their intention to consult their parliaments' on whether
to move to a single currency.
France had adopted the Maastricht treaty by referendum and should decide on
the final stage of economic and monetary union (Emu) in the same way, Mr
Chirac said. However, he suggested that the issue might not arise because he
did not believe that there would be sufficient countries economically ready
for Emu by the Maastricht treaty's 1997-99 timetable.
Last night Mr Chirac staked out a slightly more sceptical approach about the
pace of European integration as well as faster action to bring down France's
record 12.7 per cent unemployment rate, as the main elements distinguishing
his policies from those of his fellow Gaullist, Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur. The latter is expected to declare his rival candidacy, but not
until the new year.
Mr Chirac said he had formalised his candidacy on Friday in order to get the
electorate to take more notice of his views. He also confirmed last night
that at a special RPR congress on Saturday he would step down from the post
of president that he had held since 1976 in order to focus on his
presidential campaign.
An Ifop poll on presidential preferences, conducted later on Friday and
published in yesterday's Journal du Dimanche, gave him 15 per cent support
compared with 10 per cent a month ago.
The same survey showed his gain came mainly at the expense of Mr Balladur,
whose rating fell from 19 to 16 per cent over the same period, while support
for Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, declined
only marginally from 20 to 19 per cent.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Anti-EU campaigners surge forward in the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opinion polls showing anti-European Union campaigners leading or gaining
ground ahead of next Sunday's referendum on EU membership have alarmed
Swedish leaders, prompting Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, to warn
yesterday of threats to the country's cherished welfare system if there is a
No vote, Hugh Carnegy writes from Stockholm.
The Social Democratic prime minister said rejection of EU membership would
lead to a jump in interest rates. This would require tougher government
measures to control the public finances.
The future of the welfare state has become a central issue in the referendum
campaign. The No side, driven mainly by dissident Social Democrats,
left-wingers and the Environment party, argues that joining the EU will
narrow Sweden's freedom to pursue its famously generous system of universal
cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, based on high taxes.
Along with claims that EU membership will undermine Sweden's independence
and compromise its military neutrality, the No campaign appears to be
holding its own against the combined forces of the Social Democratic
leadership, the main opposition parties, industry, the trade unions and the
main farmers organisation, which all call for a Yes vote.
Although one poll last Friday showed the Yes side increasing in strength to
lead by 48 to 42 per cent, three other polls showed the No campaign gaining
sharply.
The Swedish vote follows the 56.9-43.1 per cent victory for the Yes side in
neighbouring Finland's EU referendum on October 16. In Norway, which will
vote on November 28, polls continue to show a solid lead for the No camp.
But they show that if Sweden votes Yes, the gap will narrow sharply. The
latest poll at the weekend showed the No lead in such circumstances falling
to 41-38.
Meanwhile, in Finland yesterday, an unprecedented parliamentary filibuster
mounted by EU opponents succeeded in its aim of postponing ratification of
Finnish membership until after the Swedish referendum. The Speaker will
propose today that the third and final reading of the EU bill start on
November 14.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Cold shoulder for EU from Norway's north: The debate over
Union membership has pitted the coast against Oslo and the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the outer edge of the Arctic Circle, an epic struggle is under way which
will determine Norway's future in Europe. Opposition to membership of the
European Union is an article of faith among the farmers and fishermen on
Norway's northern coast, and nobody expects the mood to change ahead the
November 28 referendum.
Mr Ivar Jorgensen, a 6ft 5in goat farmer from near Tromso, sums up the
anti-EU atmosphere: 'John Major is the only one telling the truth. He said
the European Union needs the Norway's oil and gas and fish, so get them in.'
Between beeps from his mobile phone, Mr Jorgensen ticks off more reasons for
opposing EU membership: slack EU environmental standards which allow farmers
to use growth hormones on animals; contaminated drinking water; high
unemployment; and the Common Agricultural Policy, which, he says, has forced
an Irish friend to turn his 40-cow farm into a golf course and a motor cycle
track.
'But the main reason is the Viking tradition,' says Mr Jorgensen, who would
not look out of place in a Norse long-boat. 'We won't let anyone rule over
us.'
The referendum campaign has exposed latent political conflicts in Norway.
Just as in 1973, when Norwegians narrowly voted against membership of the
(then) European Economic Community, the struggle pits the coastal periphery
against the Oslo-dominated south, the cossetted fish-and-farm economy
against free trade-minded business, and national collective bargaining,
built around strong trade unions, against Brussels-based decision-making.
'This is a struggle between traditionalists and modernisers which poses a
challenge to the Norwegian model,' says Mr Jon Erik Dolvik, head of the
Oslo-based Norwegian Institute for Social Science and Research.
The intensity of the No campaign has knocked the Labour coalition government
led by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland off balance. Mrs Brundtland has fought her
way out of tight spots before, but her own party is split on membership.
Polls show the Yes campaign trailing by a solid eight to 10 points, and the
people are wary about joining a Union. It was only early this century, she
points out during an interview in her office, that Norway escaped 600 years
of domination by either Denmark or Sweden, and won independence.
The question which the government has so far failed to answer persuasively
is what Norway stands to gain from the Union. EU newcomers such as Austria
and Finland argued successfully in their referendums that the Union offered
security against creeping instability in eastern Europe and Russia.
Sweden, which votes in its own referendum on November 13, can plead a strong
case for membership because its business and industry are entrenched in the
EU market. By contrast, the Norwegians, rich in oil, gas, and fish, suspect
that membership may prove an unequal bargain.
In Tromso Mr John Arst, a grizzled former torpedo boat captain who once
headed the Norwegian coast guard, is adamant that Norway risks having its
fisheries plundered by the Europeans, despite government claims that it
negotiated a watertight agreement on fishing quotas in its accession
agreement.
Although Mr Arst voted Yes in 1973 ('I wanted cheaper food and liquor'), he
is voting No in 1994. 'If the fish stocks disappear, the coastal communities
will disappear,' he says.
Mr Helge Gorrissen, who runs two prawn processing plants in the Tromso
region, disagrees. A No vote would destroy jobs, forcing companies to move
factories to neighbouring Sweden or Finland to take advantage of their
favourable EU tariff status. By contrast, a Yes vote would encourage
Norwegian business to create hundreds of jobs through the creation of an
indigenous fish-processing industry able to export direct to supermarkets in
Europe.
Mr Terje Osmudsen, a director of the Kvaerner shipbuilding and engineering
group, says a No vote would lead to a steady shift of 'knowledge-based'
industries to Europe. Like Mrs Brundtland, he rejects the idea that Norway
can afford to stick with membership of the European Economic Area - the
half-way house which offers the benefits of the single market without the
political obligations of full EU membership.
'We need to be involved when common rules are agreed in Brussels on
investment and standards, and on areas such as the CO energy tax or the
selection of EU-funded research programmes,' Mr Osmudsen says.
Against this hard-nosed business calculation must be set the sense of
superiority which comes naturally to a nation whose high-wage, low-inflation
economy is the envy of its Nordic neighbours.
The Norwegian model, with its commitment to open government, equality among
women and high employment, is viewed as infinitely purer than the
behind-closed-door compromises in Brussels. 'The European Union is a men's
playground,' says Mrs Grethe Fossum, a Social Democrat MP who opposes EU
entry.
It will require a formidable effort to pull public opinion round to
supporting EU membership. The best hope lies in a Swedish Yes on November
13, because it would force Norwegians to confront the prospect of relative
isolation among their Nordic neighbours.
A Norwegian No would leave the country country stranded but defiant
alongside Iceland (and Liechtenstein) inside the EEA.
Even the independent-minded Mr Arst admits he is uneasy about the future.
'If we just had a little more time (to consider EU membership),' he sighs.
'It's all being done in such a rush.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday accepted the resignation of Mr
Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister and economics minister, as the
shake-up in the government continued over the weekend.
Most of the departing minister's responsibilities were given to another
reformer, Mr Anatoly Chubais, who was promoted to first deputy prime
minister from his present post of deputy premier in charge of privatisation.
At the same time Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, named as chief
negotiator on debt rescheduling Mr Oleg Davydov, the trade minister, who
caused concern earlier this year by suggesting that Russia should not pay
back its debt.
Mr Chernomyrdin acknowledged that Mr Davydov would take some time to
familiarise himself with the debt talks, which depend heavily on whether
Russia succeeds in making an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
However, he said 'Oleg Davydov is a properly qualified' person.
Mr Shokhin had offered his resignation on Friday, after unsuccessfully
demanding that he be consulted on naming a new finance minister, and warning
that 'the economy is now hostage to politics'. His comments came as a
struggle over policy continued between Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Yeltsin.
Mr Chubais, 39, has headed Russia's programme to privatise state-run
businesses since 1991, which is at the centre of the nation's transition to
a free-market economy. As to being one of the last radical reformers left
from the team that crafted Russia's basic reforms after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, he said 'Russia has an all-reformers government'.
The new finance minister, Mr Vladimir Panskov, a former official in the
president's department of budget policy, was quoted as saying that 'there is
still a lot of work to be done' on the 1995 budget. His words left open the
possibility of changes in the budget, supposed to reduce monthly inflation
to 1 per cent with the aid of substantial borrowing from the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Chubais added to the confusion by saying that the cabinet reshuffles
'will certainly not lead to changes in the course of reform the government
has been following'. Mr Chubais said he would take charge of the economy and
finance portfolios, making him Mr Panskov's direct boss.
Mr Yeltsin added further to contradictory messages when a close aide said
the president was 'seriously concerned over the work of the government',
while saying there was no division between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin,
and that the president intended to 'push reforms quickly and effectively'.
Mr Shokhin has been working on a concept of debt repayment which would be

FT  07 NOV 94 / Scharping appeals for amnesty on Stasi links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats,
has called for a partial amnesty for those who co-operated with former east
Germany's Stasi secret police.
The plea re-opens an issue that has divided east and west Germans and has
pitted east Germans against one another as they come to terms with one of
the most hated and insidious institutions of the communist period.
Mr Scharping said it was time to grant some partial amnesty for former Stasi
employees on the grounds that it was preventing 'inner unification' and it
was time to rehabilitate some of these people. An amnesty might also have
the affect of diluting some support for the PDS, the successor to the former
east German Communist party, which contains former Stasi members.
More than 109,000 people are estimated to have collaborated with the Stasi.
A law was passed in December 1991 enabling east Germans access to their
files. It also allows public and private institutions access to screen
employees.
Mr Scharping's plea was supported by Mr Stefan Heym, the east German writer
and member of the PDS who was recently elected to the Bundestag, or lower
house.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic party and senior
members of the Gauck Commission, the institution responsible for supervising
the files, have opposed any amnesty.
'The time has not yet come, either for an amnesty or to close the files,'
said Mr Hansjorg Geiger, deputy to Mr Joachim Gauck, the former east German
Lutheran pastor who heads the Commission.
Mr Geiger said there were still more than 400,000 outstanding requests by
individuals wishing to see their files and the commission was receiving
about 500 requests a day. By last April more than 720,000, most of them east
Germans, had applied to see whether their names had appeared on any of the
files.
The files are located in the giant former Stasi headquarters in east Berlin.
Although the Stasi tried to burn or shred as many files as possible in late
1989, the Gauck commission still has over 180km of files containing 6m names
 -about 4m east Germans and 2m west Germans.
The material remains politically explosive. Prominent east German
politicians, including Mr Gregor Gysi, the parliamentary head of the PDS, is
alleged to have collaborated with the Stasi but he has vehemently denied any
of these allegations.
Opinion among east Germans remains divided about keeping the files open. Mr
Jens Reich, a physicist and member of the former east German opposition,
believes the files should be kept open to show the psychological and
political nature of totalitarianism as well as the nature of collaboration
or resistance under such a system.
But other prominent east Germans, including Mr Friedrich Schorlemmer, a
Lutheran theologian who opposed the former communist government, wants the
files closed because they impose a permanent burden of guilt on east
Germans.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Strong UK industrial growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, RODERICK ORAM and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK manufacturing industry, battered by contraction and plant closures during
the 1980s, may be entering its strongest period of growth for 30 years.
Forecasts by the London Business School predict that manufacturing output
will rise by 4.5 per cent this year and 5.6 per cent in 1995.
Manufacturing production from 1994 to 1998 will, according to the school,
show an average annual increase of 4.3 per cent. If achieved, that would
make it the best five-year period of industrial growth since 1964-68.
However, a more gloomy report published yesterday by the National
Manufacturing Council - an arm of the Confederation of British Industry -
suggests that some of British manufacturing's traditional difficulties,
including poor productivity and low investment, may become a barrier to
achieving the predicted output growth.
Manufacturing productivity, the council said, still lags some 20 per cent to
40 per cent behind output per head in leading foreign economies, and it
warned that the gap might grow as economies abroad recovered.
'We need more investment in our plants and people,' the council said in its
annual report. It added: 'The rate (of industrial growth) is insufficient to
allow Britain to catch up with its main competitors, such as Germany, Japan
and the US.'
The council added other concerns about a manufacturing recovery, including a
historically sluggish rate of investment, slower turnover of stocks than
principal competitor countries, a persistent trade deficit in manufactured
goods and lower workforce skills than competitor economies.
London Business School, taking a more optimistic view, says changes on the
supply side of the economy meant that handicaps once dubbed the 'British
disease' - low productivity growth, poor industrial relations and a
declining share of world trade - were 'a thing of the past'. Improvements in
those areas, combined with shifts towards investment and export-led growth
and a lower exchange rate, were reasons for expecting that manufacturing
industry would perform well.
The view that the overall recovery in the UK economy remains strong is
supported by Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, in the bank's
quarterly economic review today.

In a week when the US Federal Reserve intervened to support the dollar, the
main move in the EMS grid came from the Irish punt, which climbed above the
Belgian franc and the D-Mark. The punt is benefiting from sterling's
strength. This week the Bundesbank council could shift interest rates and
affect the grid. Currencies, Page 28
The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism
measured against the weakest currency in the system. Most of the currencies
can fluctuate within 15 per cent of agreed central rates against the other
members of the mechanism. The exceptions are the D-Mark and the guilder
which move in a narrow 2.25 per cent band.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Bosnia peace effort under threat after fresh clashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The upsurge in fighting between Bosnian government forces and their Serb
enemies is threatening the uneasy alliance between Russia and its western
partners, formed to promote peace in the region.
The 12-day-old flare-up in the conflict is also threatening to shatter the
tattered ceasefire in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The UN warned yesterday that renewed fighting posed a serious threat to the
welfare of the 300,000 civilians in the city and called on both sides not to
deploy heavy weapons. 'Sarajevo remains an exclusion zone in which the use
of big guns could be subject to air strikes,' a UN official said. The
warning followed an overnight incident in which Nato aircraft buzzed the
city in order to defuse a rapidly escalating confrontation between Bosnia's
Moslem-led army and the Bosnian Serbs.
Diplomats from the US, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - the five-nation
contact group working on a peace settlement for Bosnia - met senior UN and
Croatian officials in Zagreb yesterday. They were told by Croatian officials
that there was little immediate prospect of halting the fighting.
The group's unity has been strained by the fighting, with the US defending
the Bosnian army's offensive and Russia condemning it. Tensions are likely
to grow if the conflict escalates.
Up to 10,000 residents of Sarajevo were killed - mainly by Serb artillery
shells - before the establishment nine months ago of an exclusion zone in
which heavy weapons were either withdrawn or placed under UN supervision.
However, the situation in the capital, which relies on UN relief flights for
food and other essentials, has deteriorated since August when the Serbs
partly reimposed their blockade.
The weekend fighting was the latest sign that the ability of the UN's
lightly armed troops to protect the civilian population from the
consequences of war, and guarantee their own safety, is diminishing
steadily.
The fighting began when the Bosnian army opened fire with mortars on
Serb-held territory near Sarajevo, provoking Serb artillery fire on the
Moslem suburb of Hrasnica. Bosnian government infantry then advanced. Last
night the Bosnian army claimed it had captured 30 villages in two days of
fighting just to the north of Sarajevo.
In northern Bosnia, the Bosnian Serb forces said they had fought off a
threat to the town of Bosanska Krupa and regained some of the ground they
had lost over the past week.
The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government in Belgrade issued a statement at the
weekend condemning the 'deliberate and massive violation of the ceasefire
agreement on the part of Moslem and . . . Croat forces'. However, the
statement contained no suggestion that Belgrade's embargo against the
Bosnian Serbs, its former allies, would be lifted.

FT  07 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections - November 8: Democrats fear poll
earthquake in Walla Walla - A Republican threat to Speaker Tom Foley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walla Walla in south-eastern Washington, close to the Oregon border, seems
an unlikely place for an electoral earthquake. But it might play a small
role in the defeat of a sitting Speaker of the US House of Representatives -
a feat last accomplished in 1860.
An early missionary outpost that never matched the growth of coastal cities
such as Seattle, the town sits in the shadow of the Blue Mountains,
surrounded by onion fields and vineyards. It is the sort of place where a
visiting reporter asking directions at Bill McClure's farm machinery store,
will prompt customer Bob Tinker to jump into his pickup truck - with a deer
rifle hanging behind the seat - to show the way.
These are the folk on whom Republicans are counting in their confidence over
tomorrow's US congressional elections, predicting that they will make
sweeping gains. And nothing would seal their victory more sweetly than the
defeat of Mr Tom Foley in eastern Washington state. As Speaker, Mr Foley is
third in line to the US president.
After Mr Foley's surprisingly weak showing in September's primary ballot,
opinion polls showed him trailing far behind Mr George Nethercutt, a lawyer
who is the most moderate candidate the Republicans have sent against him for
years. The gap has narrowed, but Mr Foley himself says it is still 'very
much of a nip and tuck race'.
In Walla Walla there is growing irritation with politicians and government,
and more locals seem ready to throw out Mr Foley, whose intellectual and
sometimes aloof manner symbolises for some the alienation of that other
Washington on the east coast.
Perhaps the most incendiary issue has been Mr Foley's decision to join a
lawsuit questioning the constitutionality of limits on the number of terms a
politician can serve in Congress - a decision that prompted his opponents to
accuse him of suing his own voters.
'He has been ineffective here in our own district because his lack of
support for issues such as term limits, the balanced budget amendment . . .
and immigration reform have assured their defeat despite overwhelming
support in eastern Washington,' complained Ms Ruth Fleenor, a Walla Walla
voter.
The anti-Foley tide has left business leaders in the state, who have a
healthy respect for the clout of the Speaker's office, aghast. 'Don't they
know he's the third most powerful man in the country?' asked an executive
with Johnson Matthey Electronics, near Spokane, second largest city in
Washington state.
And Mr Tony Sandoval, president of the Washington state council of La Raza,
the Hispanic community organisation, shook his head in wonder. 'It's very
important to have the Speaker of the House. You'd have to be brain-dead to
pick somebody else,' he said.
But some people in Walla Walla despise the power of the Speaker's office and
the very tangible benefits it can bring to the district. 'It 'helps' to get
more pork in the state, and I don't believe in the pork barrel,' said Ms
Edith Largent.
Although this is his 16th election, Congressman Foley's campaigning skills
have rarely been put to such a test. At a meeting with voters this weekend
in the Red Apple restaurant, on Spokane's Main Street, he appeared deeply
uncomfortable when appealing for votes. He relaxed only when offered the
chance for a detailed lecture on policy or the constitution.
But the campaign, like many across the US this year, has been unpleasant,
with each candidate ferociously attacking the other in television and radio
advertisements. The viciousness of the campaign has turned away voters such
as Mr McClure, the farm machinery store owner.
'I think they're both really fine gentlemen, but they are both trying to
degrade each other to the point where we don't want to watch it any more,'
he says.

FT  07 NOV 94 / Tory right threatens EU revolt after retreat on postal
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rightwing Conservatives are threatening to block a crucial bill to increase
British contributions to the European Union in retaliation for the cabinet
climbdown over Post Office privatisation.
Amid growing rightwing anger at Mr John Major's decision to give way to a
handful of mainly leftwing Post Office rebels, cabinet loyalists sought to
defuse the row by pledging that privatisation was still on the government's
agenda.
In a robust defence of the prime minister, Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party
chairman, told BBC radio that Mr Major retained the support of 'the vast
majority' of MPs.
He said ministers 'do not believe this policy is wrong, but maybe we do need
to sell it better'. Sir Norman Fowler, his predecessor as party chairman,
told BBC television: 'Anybody who thinks this is the end of the matter
should think again.'
However, rightwingers queued up to blame the retreat on weak leadership by
Mr Major. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said it was 'absurd that
the government should be held to ransom by a taxi-full of flotsam and
bobtail'.
Mr Lamont said the rebels would have backed down if the prime minister had
made the bill an issue of confidence, as he had done when faced with a
rightwing rebellion against the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty on
European integration.
Mr Lamont said he would vote for the bill increasing contributions to the
EU, which implements an agreement setting a higher ceiling for payments
along lines he negotiated as chancellor.
But, in a clear warning to the government's business managers, Mr Lamont
said the Post Office debacle would increase opposition to the bill by
rightwing critics of the EU, who would demand 'a very thorough examination
of it'.
The bill, which will be included in the Queen's speech to parliament on
November 16, is vulnerable because the number of committed Euro-sceptics far
exceeds the government's Commons majority of 13.
It is broadly supported by the main opposition parties, but Labour is
working on parliamentary manoeuvres intended to embarrass the government
into relying on a vote of confidence to force the bill through.
In a development which could
be significant if the government's fortunes fail to recover, rightwingers
praised Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, for seeking
to press ahead with Post Office privatisation.
Mr Edward Leigh, a former minister, said Mr Heseltine had 'covered himself
in glory', and hinted that the right might back him in a leadership
challenge against Mr Major if the government fails to rebuild its popularity
over the next year.

jointly developed.
The agreement builds on the PowerPC alliance formed by the companies three
years ago which was established to challenge the PC industry standards for
hardware and software based on Intel microprocessors and Microsoft software.
The success of the alliance has been limited by incompatibilities between
Apple's Power Macintosh computers and the PowerPC computers built by
Motorola and IBM. On Monday, the companies will announce that they have
agreed to eliminate these incompatibilities. But it will be two years before
computers based on the new standard are available.
Talks among the three companies have been underway for several months,
fuelling rumours that either IBM or Motorola might acquire, or take an
equity stake in Apple. IBM had also been reported to be close to reaching an
agreement to license Apple's Macintosh software.
But in the event, the new agreement between Apple , IBM and Motorola applies
only to the hardware specification for PCs.
An important goal of the new pact is to encourage third party software
companies to develop applications for PowerPC computers. The lack of
software for PowerPC was cited by IBM when it postponed introduction of its
planned Power Personal range of PCs last month.
The new design will run a variety of operating systems including Apple's Mac
OS, IBM's OS/2 and others. If developers could write software that runs on
several operating systems on one machine, with only slight modifications,
they might be more inclined to write software for the PowerPC computers ,
analysts said.

Six US congressmen have appealed to President Bill Clinton to delay the
implementation of tough new rules on oil tankers sailing to US ports. The
rules, which impose much higher financial liability on tanker owners in the
event of an oil spill, could cause serious disruption to American oil
imports, the congressmen from both political parties warned. International
shipowners' organisations have been lobbying for several months for a change
or postponement in the US Coastguard's regulations which take effect on
December 28.

<TEXT>
The contest to head the future World Trade Organisation appears to be
deadlocked, Mr Kim Chul-su, the South Korean candidate, said yesterday. In
Geneva to lobby Gatt ambassadors for his cause, Mr Kim said he did not know
how the deadlock would be broken but 'I am in this race to the finish'. With
only a month to go before a formal decision is due to be taken by the 124
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, support for the three
contenders is split along regional lines. Japan and most of Asia are backing
Mr Kim, South Korea's trade and industry minister, while the US and Latin
America are firmly behind Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, outgoing Mexican
president. European support has gone to Mr Renato Ruggiero, a former Italian
trade minister. Soundings last month among 80 or so countries showed Mr Kim
in third place, slightly behind Mr Salinas, who was trailing Mr Ruggiero.
All three candidates are now jostling for support from 'non-aligned' regions
such as Africa and for 'second-preference' votes in the hope of improving
their chances as the consensus candidate.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Commons rooftop protesters try to stay in touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's good to talk - which is why the five men who scaled the House of
Commons yesterday to protest against the Criminal Justice Act took a mobile
phone with them.
It was lunchtime when they breached the Palace of Westminster's defences,
jumping over a wall, shinning up a drainpipe and clambering on to the roof
of Westminster Hall, one of London's best-known landmarks. By 1.30pm they
were perched astride the roof, just below Big Ben, with banner unfurled.
On the ground, equally well equipped, was the group's press liaison officer
 -with a lawyer. Press releases were handed out, giving a number on which
'live interviews' could be conducted with the climbers.
Mr Patrick Field, the press officer, said they were staging the protest 'as
citizens against the criminal justice bill'. He said the men had carried out
'a certain amount of reconnaissance', after which it was just 'jump over the
wall and charge'.
Scotland Yard said seven men went over the wall but two were arrested before
they could make the climb. Both face breach-of-the-peace charges.
Three of the climbers came down later and were driven away in a police van.
They are believed to have been arrested on suspicion of committing criminal
damage.
But all did not go entirely as planned for the climbers - repeated attempts
to contact them on their mobile phone were unsuccessful.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Drunk as a philosopher: Fancy a quick drink? Socrates was
your man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fancy a quick one after work? Think very carefully about it, for you will
either be substantially decreasing your chances of succumbing to heart
disease, or you will be stumbling on a slippery slope which leads inexorably
to cancers and chronic liver complaints, dependence, violence and crime.
There is, it would seem, no middle way. This week's tiff between the World
Health Organisation and a couple of reputable British scientists over the
effects of alcohol consumption has severely dented our confidence in that
most insidious of myths, that the moderate embrace of a vice can turn into a
virtue.
Fancy a quick one after work? It used to be such an innocent question,
easily considered and quickly answered, perhaps a brief consultation with
the crumpled railway timetable, a swift call home, but no more. That such an
inquiry could now lead us straight into pained calculations on mortality and
even (after a couple to warm up) the after-life is an unhappy indictment of
our positivistic culture which claims to know so much more than it does.
The WHO is, to be fair, only doing its job. It believes genuinely that there
is 'no minimum threshold below which alcohol can be consumed without any
risk'; its message to the world is a catchy 'The less you drink, the
better', which I can just see jostling in the global consciousness with the
glossy Martini ads and lurid billboards of young, semi-naked bodies imbibing
various versions of the hard stuff.
I wonder what the Greeks would have made of it. They liked a drink, although
you would hardly know it listening to the sanctimonious claims made on
behalf of their culture. I have always asked myself why people are only too
happy to quote the ancient world when they are discussing subjects of
gravitas, such as the nature of beauty or the appeal of democracy, but
ignore what John Stuart Mill would have called the pursuit of the baser
pleasures which took up so much of their time.
For the fact is that all that contemplation of the virtuous life and the
philosophical intrigues of existence was undertaken in an alcoholic fog the
likes of which would send our dear old friends at the WHO diving into their
glasses of mineral water in fright.
Consider the evidence: the comic poet Eubolos gave a pithy account of his
own health advice to contemporaries: 'Three kraters only do I mix for the
temperate - one to health, which they empty first, the second to love and
pleasure, the third to sleep.' So far, so good.
'When this is drunk up, wise guests go home. The fourth krater is ours no
longer, but belongs to insults, the fifth to uproar, the sixth to drunken
revel, the seventh to black eyes. The eighth is the policeman's, the ninth
belongs to vomiting, and the tenth to madness and hurling the furniture.'
Whoops, sounds like we are on that slippery slope.
When one considers that a krater held about 14 litres of naturally fermented
wine, admittedly diluted with water, which serviced a gathering of about
seven couches (two, of course, to a couch), we get some idea of what these
sessions involved. After the talk was finished, the group would go on a
ritual drunken revel (komos) during which they would parade through the
streets, singing and dancing, assaulting passers-by and damaging property.
All this in the name of Dionysus, though it might as well have been Arsenal.
The respect for the joys of the grape can clearly be seen in Plato's
Symposium, when the drunken roar of Alcibiades threatens to disrupt the
hitherto civilised discourse on the meaning of love.
'Will you welcome into your company a man who is already drunk?' he asks his
colleagues; not only do they welcome him, they ask him to contribute to
their musings. At the end of his contribution, the party fizzles out in
'general uproar, all order was abolished and deep drinking became the rule'.
This is not to champion the cause of drink, nor to persuade any of you to
stay behind for a quick one at the end of your next working day. That would
be irresponsible. But the association of love, beauty, truth and drunkenness
has a history which goes a little deeper than the oracular verdicts of
today's scientists, and we would do well to bear that in mind too.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Tragedy of the useless arts: Philip Crowe asks whether poems
and opera can make the human species less brutish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year it was a concrete house which won the Turner Prize. It was
denounced by one expert in modern art as the 'biggest piece of junk ever'.
This year's hot tip for the Pounds 20,000 award is five solid iron
sculptures of a naked man, each bent in a 90' angle and arranged in
different positions. The entry, called 'Testing a World View', is said by
the sculptor to show the 'western culture's right-angled psychological
dimension. Flung around the room, they demonstrate the current crisis of
this kind of world view.'
Someone once said that the definition of the highest art is that one should
feel that life is this, and not otherwise. It may be hard, but not
necessarily impossible, to feel that life is the concrete inside of a house
or the random arrangement of solid iron figures.
The highest art gives a vision of what human life can be. It opens up
possibilities dimly seen. It lifts the spirit, and because it has the power
to make people feel that 'life is this and not otherwise,' it has the power
to transform human life. Yet, in spite of all this, art remains essentially
useless, particularly when usefulness is measured by the criteria of the
market economy.
In his earlier life, Leo Tolstoy, author of War and Peace, was strenuously
opposed to any idea that art can be useful. The true purpose of art, he
maintained, was 'to make people love life in all its countless,
inexhaustible manifestations. If I were told,' he wrote, 'that I could write
a novel whereby I might irrefutably establish what seemed to me the correct
point of view on all social problems, I would not even devote two hours to
such a novel; but if I were to be told that what I should write would be
read in about 20 years by those who are now children, and that they would
laugh and cry over it and love life, I would devote all my own life and all
my energies to it.'
Sadly in his later life, Tolstoy abandoned this view. Instead he held that
art should be made to serve good moral purposes, and he tried to buttress
his arguments by telling a famous story.
It is the story of a princess who goes to the theatre, driven there in her
coach by her old and faithful coachman. The tragedy on stage moves her to
tears. Meanwhile outside the night is bitterly cold and a real tragedy takes
place. Her faithful coachman, waiting to take her home, freezes to death.
Tolstoy intended the story as a dreadful example of the failure to make
connections between art and good behaviour; but all his passionate arguments
failed. They proved less telling than the story itself, of the weeping
princess and the freezing coachman, which is in fact a parable of the
uselessness of art.
Kenneth Clark, whose personal view of civilisation was so cultured and
compelling, grew up to love and trust paintings more than people. His son
tells that 'he found that art could give him tenderness and solace and
energy and tranquillity and a beauty without asking for anything in return.'
Human beings he found more problematic. His wife, crushed by the casual
nature of his many transient relationships, found solace not in art but in
alcohol. The irony is greater even than in Tolstoy's story - Lord Clark on
television eloquently extolling the glories of civilisation and art, while
at home his wife drank herself into uncivilised oblivion.
Exposure to centuries of great art does not seem to have done much for the
morality of either nations or individuals. Art is useless. It has no
immediate, practical value. Technological progress has done more than art to
soften the brutishness of the human species.
Looking at paintings does not feed the hungry, listening to Beethoven does
not house the homeless. But art has a deep, essential uselessness. Like
religion, art is concerned with ultimate ends, with what human life is
really about. Art which degenerates into propaganda, which has to be useful
in some practical way, misses the point. In itself, art is impotent. To
experience great art may transform human life, but it will not necessarily
do so.
Great art invites us to see things as they truly are. It illumines the
world, and shows us what might be. It can take us out of ourselves.
Art, at its best, is a living experience, as profound as that which TS Eliot
describes when he writes of:
'Music heard so deeply
That it is not heard at all,
But you are the music
While the music lasts.'
What we make of that living experience is up to us.

FT  05 NOV 94 / As They Say in Europe: All the president's cardinals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Le Soir of Brussels proclaimed: 'Santer forms his Commission but not without
conflicts.' The Corriere della Sera of Milan led on 'The Pope suddenly
changes his Conclave.' It was nice that secular and spiritual Europe should
move in step. And interesting that in catholic Europe (outside Brussels) the
Vatican was generally given pride of place; in protestant lands it was the
'puff of white smoke' from Jaques Santer's Luxembourg castle as he handed
out his gifts.
Le Monde was the one paper to get the balance right. Both stories featured
heavily on the front page and were analysed by similar yardsticks. The
French were pleased that the trade commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, was
deprived of what he saw as the central element in his portfolio - relations
with eastern Europe. Le Meridional said: 'The manner in which Santer cut
down to size the notorious Leon Brittan, the bete noire of the French . . .
demonstrates his will to stamp his mark on the future development of
Europe.'
Le Monde reckoned that Santer had 'to act straightaway and decisively in
face of the strong personality and ambitions of the British commissioner'.
It also derived a good deal of innocent pleasure from the reaction in
Britain: 'In a fit of offended nationalism the 'Eurosceptic' current of
British Conservatives stands behind Sir Leon and sees, once again, a hard
blow from the despised Brussels institution.'
The analysis of winners and losers dominated much of the account of both
decisions. The big loser in both cases was Italy. Rome has no senior
commissioner in Brussels and gained only three new cardinals among the 30
named last Sunday. The Germans were left out of this list entirely, and they
made no advances in the Commission. Spain, curiously, emerged well from both
conclaves, for similar, third-worldly reasons. Le Monde said it now seemed
to be the 'great country' of southern Europe. But where the paper made an
error was to fail to run the two stories as one.
After all, the Pope, a Pole, promoted east Europeans in large numbers and
Santer fellow members of the Benelux grouping. If indeed there is a pattern
emerging in Brussels it is one modelled on Rome.
So we should look to history to see what the future may hold. In his book
The Italians, Luigi Barzini wrote that popes were at a disadvantage compared
with kings. Just as, one might say, Euro-presidents are compared with prime
ministers. When a pope was appointed he was often old and decrepit. 'He was
in a hurry: he had to do for his kinsmen, within a few years, before it was
too late, what most royal families had taken centuries to achieve . . . The
men surrounding him were adequately loyal, but not to him.'
The parallel offers sufficient similarities to merit further consideration.
The European Union offers a reasonable facsimile of western Christendom
circa 1540. The protestant Reformation was well under way and the uniformity
of medieval Europe had fallen apart. The key novelty was the doctrine of
justification by works ('do good and you shall be saved') as opposed to the
catholic emphasis on justification by faith ('believe and you shall be
saved'). Martin Luther thought that anybody worth anything should be able to
prove it through actions rather than by public displays of devotion.
In the European argument the questions at issue in the reformation are
translated into modern terms. One's fidelity to the European cause is, in
most of the Union, judged by one's ability to recite the trinitarian creed
of one currency, convergence and monetary union. The protestants reject this
idolatry. They ask whether devotees have in fact implemented the
Commission's directive on asbestos extraction in forklift trucks.
Euro-protestantism is at its strongest in Britain and Denmark; in Germany
the post-reformation concept of cuius regio, eius religio is in force. The
Germans prefer the protestant virtues of their D-Mark to the universality of
the ecu. But their leaders' Euro-orthodoxy means they have no choice but to
accept the direction in which the country is being driven.
Unfortunately, Brussels is not yet in all respects a new Rome and the
Commission not yet a college of cardinals. In the Corriere della Sera, a
reporter who is a long-time friend of one new cardinal, Ersilio Tonini,
quoted him as saying: 'To live in peace, a chunk of bread and a clear
conscience suffice.' Try telling that to a European Commissioner.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Private View: The woman who asked too many questions -
Wangari Maathai has paid a heavy price for criticising the Kenyan government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asking questions can get a person into trouble. It has cost Wangari Maathai
her marriage and her job; she has been besieged in her house, held in jail,
and beaten unconscious by police on the streets of Nairobi.
Professor Maathai is an environmental campaigner. In her country, Kenya, (as
in many more liberal democracies) this can be a very political profession.
For the moment, she is free to come and go. The latest charges against her,
of seditious rumour, have been dropped. 'But I'm afraid of the government,'
she said. 'I'm afraid of what they could do to me because I have not stopped
doing what I was doing when they were harassing me.
'Fortunately, I've had a lot of international support,' she said, not
mentioning a clutch of awards. 'Friends have appealed for my life. Every
time I'm arrested my friends raise hell and they release me.'
It was unfair to pretend she was still in danger now that the government of
President Daniel arap Moi has stopped pursuing her. 'But anybody who has
been assassinated has not been pre-warned. So I have to be careful.'
A more unlikely-looking target for assassination it would be hard to
imagine. What you see in the face of this 54-year-old woman is not the hard,
hunted look of the political dissident but the smiling eyes and little
pearly teeth of a schoolgirl.
I asked her if being a woman had been some sort of protection.
'Well, I don't really know. Some people think that perhaps if I had been a
man I would have been eliminated a long time ago. That's probably true.
Also, perhaps, if I had been a man I would have been much more influential
than I am,' she laughed.
Formerly an associate professor of microanatomy at the University of
Nairobi, Wangari Maathai says she is not politically ambitious.
She once tried to stand for parliament but was disqualified, losing her
academic post in the process. She demurred when women supporters urged her
to oppose Moi in the presidential election two years ago.
'I'm not looking for power, I'm not trying to overthrow anybody,' she said.
'I'm just trying to raise issues and I think the system sees that.'
How did you become such a troublemaker?
Maathai laughed at the designation. 'I think it started as I was growing
up,' she began, then paused, head tilted interrogatively. 'How did I really
get myself into all this?'
As the first African woman professor in the country, she was co-opted on to
a national women's council in the early 1970s. There she discovered that
there was 'a lot of misery in the rural areas, no water, no energy, no
firewood, and a lot of malnutrition among children'.
Such observations fell on a mind prepared. In 1960 the young Wangari Muta
had been picked as one of 300 young Kenyans for a pre-independence
scholarship programme set up in the US. She studied biology at Kansas and
Pittsburgh, then microanatomy in Munich, Bavaria.
'The country I left was extremely green, the rivers were clean, there was
plenty of food. I come back seven years later and there was a lot of
deforestation in order to plant cash crops. There was a lot of soil erosion:
you could see gullies, the silt in the rivers.
'So I started asking questions. That is how I eventually got into a
confrontation with the politicians, because I started seeing the linkage
between public policy and what was happening on the ground.'
In 1977 she started a women's tree-planting movement called Green Belt,
which was supported by government foresters and funded by private sponsors.
Its success brought her to the attention of UN and other agencies when they
set up shop in Nairobi.
Trees led to environmental politics, and politics to clashes with Moi's
government. Maathai has been hauled off for protesting about a planned
skyscraper in Uhuru ('freedom') Park and demonstrating for the release of
political prisoners. She has accused Moi of whipping up tribal hatred in
order to divide the opposition and has appealed to foreign donors to
withhold aid while there is administrative corruption.
One victim of her activism was her marriage to Mwangi Maathai, a politician
in the ruling Kanu party. They have three children, all now studying in the
US.
I asked her why he had sued for divorce.
'I think from his point of view I was a woman who was a little too, er . . .
conspicuous for him. He was a politician and he wanted to be successful and
I think I was a little bit overshadowing to him, and I didn't realise.
'Now today, if we were to start all over again, he would probably say I was
an asset. He should have used me, actually, because I had the talents he
needed for a political partner. But he tried to control it in a way that was
a little difficult.
'Economically and socially I was independent. Emotionally I was very
dependent on him. And I think that he felt like he needed . . . a woman. If
you look independent and you can put your points across and you can stand
your ground, unless you have a very understanding man, you can be a threat.
And I think that's what I was. Only I was too young to understand.'
Matters were made worse by the divorce process itself. Wangari says that her
side of the case was ignored. The divorce became a public issue in which she
was to be taught a lesson. When she accused the judge of being either
corrupt or incompetent she was arrested and tried for contempt.
Will you get married again?
'I dunno. I haven't met a man to marry me.' She laughed.
What sort of man would you want this time?
She found this hilarious. 'Maybe I should go back and marry the same old
man. Yeah.' There was a note of real regret in her laugh.
Other people must have asked questions of the system, I said, but would not
risk going to jail for it. Why did you?
'I sometimes don't know the answer myself. But I say it was because I was
educated in mission schools, mostly taught by nuns. I think they influenced
my life; these are people who also had left their countries and were there
believing in fairness, doing good.'
Maathai grew up in Solai, north of Nakuru in the Rift Valley, and went to
school in Nyeri where her family had come from. I asked: what about your
parents? Did they ask questions?
'No. My parents were farmers, very simple farmers. My father was a mechanic,
a squatter on a white settler's farm so he didn't ask questions.' Her father
and the estate owner had been 'great friends', she said.
Studying biology made her inquisitive, too. 'I have a mind that tends to ask
why. I do get into a lot of trouble because I'm not satisfied with the
reasons I'm given. If there are no trees, then why can't we plant them? I
want to get to the root of the problem. That way of thinking made me get
completely out of the academic circus.'
Maathai said she won no popularity prizes for sticking her neck out.
'In the beginning a lot of people, and especially a lot of women, thought
that I was just being troublesome because I was educated. The way they saw
it was like I was showing off, like I was just trying to be snobbish.
'That bothered me in the beginning. But we have been able to show that it's
OK to stand up and now the same people turn around and say it's OK.
'I wasn't being trained to sit down and enjoy my wealth and my comfort. So I
have always studied to ask questions, and I have got into a lot of trouble.
But I haven't learned to be quiet, yet.' She flashed a big smile.
'And I don't think I will learn, because I think people are silenced through

FT  05 NOV 94 / Fashion: A laddish hi-tech style for town and country - Nick
Ashley inherited a famous fashion name. Now he has his own shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK ASHLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nick Ashley, son of Laura and Bernard Ashley, tried to introduce menswear
into the Ashley store chain at least twice during his 15-year reign as the
company's design director. Each time, the grey suits in the boardroom
stamped on the idea, perhaps rightly concluding that mixing floral frocks
with men's clothing would not work.
Having left the family company two years ago, 37-year-old Nick has decided
to go it alone and at last has achieved his long-held dream and opened his
own menswear business.
One might expect the heir of industrial tycoons to have no shortage of cash
to throw at a new venture. But, just as Laura and Bernard began by designing
dresses on their kitchen table, Nick has had to start on a small scale. He
has funded the venture himself and says that, in spite of recent reports
about vast inheritances, his 'net worth is little more than what I'm
standing up in', though he still owns some shares in the old family company.
The shop is small and unassuming though not 'in a way that shows some
trendy, Shaker influence, it looks more like a Welsh pub'. It is in an
unglitzy part of town at 57 Ledbury Road, Notting Hill, west London and
there have been no fancy interior designers - 'just a lick of paint, keeping
it minimalist' and no marketing men designing clever logos. The carrier bags
are plain brown.
Nick's design philosophy is based around 'old styles for modern living'. He
is specialising in practical, durable outerwear, ideal for the sporting life
and wet and windy weekends in the country. However, he wants to erode the
differences between town and country clothing by combining the purely
functional with urban style and comfort. The resulting cocktail could be
described as gamekeeper-meets-motorcycle courier or Mulberry-meets-Dr Marten
Clothing.
The clothing sometimes seems amateur and home-made, what the Japanese call a
'high-touch product' but Nick, whose hobby is motorcross racing when he is
at his country home in Wales, is excited by this concept and believes he has
discovered a niche in the market.
'I designed the collection for myself and my friends,' he says from his flat
in Kensington, London, which he shares with his wife, Ari, and 2 1/2
 year-old daughter, Lily. 'I want to do away with the need for separate
wardrobes for town and country, one sophisticated and one frumpy.'
The collection includes reefer coats, drape coats, tailored hacking jackets,
cotton trousers, fleece work shirts and accessories such as shoes, boots,
hats, gloves and retro-style motorcycle helmets and goggles. The predominant
colours are black and navy, although traditional country greens and browns
are available.
Prices range from Pounds 60 for a shirt to Pounds 350 for a jacket.
However, the collection's most novel feature lies in its use of fabrics.
Nick has taken high-performance fabrics, such as Ventile and Polartec, used
by mountain climbing clothing specialists, and applied them to everyday
outerwear. By doing so, he has cut out the need for the oily, smelly
weather-proofing treatments so prevalent in much huntin', shootin' 'n'
fishin' clothing. In effect he has borrowed the technology of tough
practical, functional clothing and smartened the designs up, giving them a
fashionable, but not too fashionable, edge.
'Clothes,' says Nick, 'should not say too much about you. People who wear
corduroy trousers, tweed jackets, poplin shirts and brogues are immediately
pigeon-holed as public school types. My kit functions well out of doors but
it does not give off any social message.'
Nick studied fashion at St Martin's College of Art and Design where he was a
contemporary of Rifat Ozbek. But he claims he learnt most about clothes, and
tailoring in particular, while working part-time for the late Tommy Nutter,
the Savile Row bespoke tailor.
When he was design director at Laura Ashley he built a team of 10 designers
into 60 as the company expanded into more and more areas. By the time he
left, his department was responsible for 2,500 fabrics each year and the
company had 450 shops around the world. However, in spite of his background
in the family business, his plans for his own label are more modest.
He has inherited a distrust of wholesaling clothes from his parents and he
claims he will only offer consumers the range through his own shops. 'My
parents wasted 20 years wholesaling through the 1950s and 1960s,' he says,
quoting the much-used retail dictum: 'Sales are for vanity but profit is for
sanity.'
He knows his clothes will never appeal to the mass-market - laddish types
rather like himself are his main target - so he has no designs on the high
street. He plans ultimately to expand internationally with just one shop in
each of several important cities - if London is a success he will look for a
more central shop and after that will come New York, San Francisco, Paris,
Milan and Tokyo.
His father Bernard, who is still running Laura Ashley, is at hand to offer
marketing advice. That company began life with the forgettable name of
Bernard Ashley Fabrics Limited. Bernard changed to the more romantic Laura
Ashley only when his wife wanted to design nighties. 'Dad refused to put his
name to anything so sissy,' says Nick.

FT  05 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Smaller numbers on your telephone bill -
Peter Knight looks at the large and complex variety of saving schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hurrah for the free market. Some of the political promises made at the time
BT was privatised are finally coming true - competition in the domestic
telephone market really is driving down the cost of talking.
Business has already benefited but now householders can cut their phone
bills quite substantially by using alternative telephone companies or
subscribing to the discount schemes offered by BT.
Mercury, the well-established UK telephone company owned by Cable &amp;
Wireless; Energis, owned by the National Grid, and the cable television
companies, offer telephone services to homes, usually with promises of
cheaper long-distance calls and charging by time rather than unit.
This competition, as the privatisation theorists promised, has forced BT to
improve its service, reduce the cost of long-distance calls and offer a
range of discount options. You can even collect air miles on your telephone
account.
But this does not mean that life is any easier. On the contrary, we have
lost the glorious simplicity of the old GPO days when everyone was expected
to rejoice at the privilege of owning a phone no matter what the quality and
cost of the service. Now we have a range of savings options that, at first
sight, seem complex enough to flummox Gary Kasparov.
Telephony has become a commodity business and the telephone companies
compete primarily on cost. Some offer better services, such as highly
detailed bills, but for most of us the main reason for using another service
would be because it is cheaper.
Unless you subscribe to cable television that also offers telephone
services, you cannot escape BT altogether because BT provides the main
infrastructure on which the other carriers piggyback. This means that as
soon as you use an alternative carrier you will have two bills, one from BT
and another from your chosen alternative. Take the cost and hassle of
subscribing to two services into account when making cost comparisons.
Also remember that BT offers a range of discount options to suit all sorts
of customers from the very low user to the terminally loquacious. These
discounts are based on the volume of calls, so if you shift some of your
calls to another carrier, then the rate of discount from BT will be smaller.
More on this later.
Most people have very definite telephone needs and calling habits. Here are
some rule-of-thumb suggestions to reduce your bill, calculated to meet the
needs of four different types of customer.
Local calls only
Stick with BT and investigate some of their discount schemes. The new
carriers are competing mainly in the long-distance and international
sectors. The only exception is if you have cable television and that company
offers telephone services - then you could dispense with BT altogether, but
compare charges first.
If you spend less than Pounds 35 a quarter, join BT's Light User Scheme,
over that amount, then look at some of the other BT schemes.
Local calls and long distance calls to one person
If your bill is below Pounds 100 a quarter and local calls are the biggest
cost, then it is probably sensible to stay with BT and use its Family and
Friends discount scheme (see below) if it is offered in your area. If the
bill is mainly made up of long-distance or international calls, then look at
an alternative carrier.
Bills of more than Pounds 100 a quarter with lots of long-distance calls
If long-distance calls are contributing most of the cost, then you can save
by using an alternative carrier, such as Mercury or Energis. Depending on
the age of your local BT exchange, you could also benefit from better
services (such as fully itemised bills) by using a carrier other than BT.
If you want to stay with BT, then look at the discount schemes that are
aimed at you. But remember, if you use both BT and an alternative carrier,
you will reduce the savings made on the BT discount schemes.
Pounds 100-plus bill made up mostly of long-distance and overseas calls
Investigate another carrier immediately, but check that the rates for the
region of the world you are calling regularly is competitive with BT. If you
call the US mainly, then check out the call-back schemes offered by some
specialist operators who advertise in the FT.
BT DISCOUNT SCHEMES Light User Scheme. Rebate offered for customers who
spend less than Pounds 10 a month.
Friends and Family. Provides a 5 per cent discount on five nominated
telephone numbers, which can include one international number. Only open to
those customers whose local exchange provides full itemised billing. One-off
joining fee of Pounds 4.99.
Option 15. Designed for customers with quarterly bills of over Pounds 40 and
promises a 10 per cent discount. Quarterly fee of Pounds 4. Dr John Hunter
of Hunter Associates, specialists in telephone call charges, says the actual
savings once the charge has been included in the equation is less than 5 per
cent on a bill of Pounds 50 a quarter and around 7 per cent on Pounds 100
bill.
Premier Line. Designed for those with regular bills over Pounds 100 a
quarter. Provides up to 15 per cent discount on direct-dialled calls and
customers can accumulate 'Talking Points' which can be exchanged for gifts
or air miles. Annual fee of Pounds 24. Once this fee has been included in
the calculations, Hunter estimates that the scheme will give about 10 per
cent savings on a bill of Pounds 100 a quarter. Savings rise with the size
of the bill, but you will have to spend about Pounds 1,000 a quarter before
you achieve 15 per cent.
BT also offers a range of discount options to business. These might be worth
investigating if you make a lot of business calls from home, but remember
that you will have to re-classify your line as business to take advantage of
these discounts, and that costs more.
It might be worth buying a calculator before you start to work out your
options.
Information: BT - dial 150. Mercury: Freecall 0500 200 960 Energis: 0800 162

FT  05 NOV 94 / How To Spend It: Rough times for cashmere - Lucia van der
Post explains why prices of the luxurious fabric will rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The relationship between the supply and demand of cashmere, that softest,
lightest, warmest, most delectable of fibres, has always been a delicate
one. When the two are in harmony the knitwear manufacturers and we, the
customers, can enjoy stable prices and steady supplies. When they are out of
kilter, then there is trouble - or, more precisely, there is expense.
In Scotland, where the combination of pure water, finest yarns and know-how
produce the best knitwear, there is considerable agitation. The tranquil
years of stable prices seem to have to come an end. The Chinese, who have
been the sole suppliers of that ineffably soft down from under the neck of
the cashmere goat, have finally become highly successful competitors in the
textile market.
The Chinese economy is booming and refined, luxurious shops such as
Ermenegildo Zenga are opening in Beijing at quite a pace. Private enterprise
is being encourage and there is now a very efficient, very hungry textile
business. Hong Kong has invested heavily in mainland China and now that Hong
Kong itself has become an expensive place to manufacturer, more
manufacturing is being done in China.
There is not enough raw material to go round and most suppliers have already
put their prices up by 15 per cent. It seems certain they will rise further.
The big players - companies such as Dawson and Johnstons of Elgin - which do
everything from treating the fleeces to designing, manufacturing and
retailing, can absorb some of the extra costs along the way. The smaller
producers who are involved in only one or two processes have to make a
return at every level.
James Sugden of Johnstons says that: 'Until supply and demand come into
balance this nonsense will go on.' Ultimately, he believes, Chinese wages
and costs will rise, making their own costs nearer those of Scotland. 'In
the meantime we have to look at margins, efficient distribution, service and
design if we are going to have a chance of competing.'
To keep costs down many companies are looking at mixing cashmere with other
materials - Pringle has had a particular success with its cashmere and silk
and cashmere and cotton mixes. Mail order has also grown in the wake of
pressure on margins and there is a host of companies now selling classic
designs by post.
Meanwhile in Scotland, some farmers are experimenting with farming their own
cashmere-producing goats. The first garments made from Scottish cashmere are
already on the shelves of top stores in Tokyo, Edinburgh, Paris and New
York. Belinda Robertson, for instance, has used it for a special limited
edition. All should bear a swing ticket saying they are made of Scottish
cashmere.
Even so, if you fancy some cashmere this winter, the message is: hurry.
There is nowhere for prices to go but up.
The Cashmere Store, 2, Saint Giles Street, Edinburgh EH1 (Tel: 031-225 5178)
sells classic cashmere knitwear - cardigans, V-necked jumpers, that sort of
thing, by mail order at good prices. Pounds 149 for a two-ply cashmere
cardigan, Pounds 99 for a V-necked sweater.
Brora, 7a Filmer Road Studios, 75 Filmer Road, London SW6, sells classic
knitwear, jumpers and V or high-necked cardigans at the best prices around,
Pounds 110 each. Men's cardigans are Pounds 145, waistcoats Pounds 135.
There is a mail order service.
Elizabeth Stanbury of 7, Bridge Street, Hungerford, Berkshire and 37, Upper
Brook Street (first floor, just ring the bell), London W1 offers a charming
personal service. Her two shops have sofas, a warm welcome and a willingness
to make any design in any colour the customer fancies. There are easy
country styles and sophisticated town ones. You could spend a little (for
cashmere]), for example Pounds 60 on a small scarf, or a lot, up to Pounds
1,750 for a silk-bordered king-size 100 per cent cashmere blanket.
Madeleine Trehearne, of whom I wrote in the summer, has just come back from
India with another batch of her exquisitely soft and luxurious Shahtoosh,
Toosh, and Pashmina shawls. In fashionable shops they start at Pounds 1,600
and go on up to Pounds 2,500 a time but Madeleine, because she sells them
from her own home and has only her own and her partner's travelling costs to
cover, sells items from Pounds 600, for the Pashmina, to Pounds 1,200, for
the finest of them all, the Shahtoosh. There are lots of colours and designs
but I think much the nicest are the plain caramel coloured ones. Ring her on
071-435 6310 for an appointment to view and buy.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Property: The chancellor holds the key - Simon London on
whether the Budget could affect the prospects for the housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anxious estate agents are among those awaiting with trepidation for the
Budget to be announced at the end of this month by Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
Contrary to expectations, the housing market's bright start to the year did
not last through the summer, and the National Association of Estate Agents
found recently that two-thirds of its members had seen the market
deteriorate through the autumn.
Yet, most economists agree that any further tinkering with mortgage interest
tax relief is unlikely to have much impact. The phased reduction of relief
to a rate of 15 per cent, announced in the March 1993 Budget, should already
be factored into house prices. The greatest erosion of this tax break came
late in the 1980s when the threshold was frozen - yet, the housing market
continued to over-heat.
Optimists point out that the wider picture is favourable. Rarely have house
prices been lower relative to average earnings: the average home now sells
for 3.5 times earnings, having touched five times at the peak of the market
in 1989.
The lesson of previous economic cycles is that house prices normally lag
behind disposable incomes through recession but catch up quickly as recovery
takes hold. So long as the chancellor keeps the economy on track, the
argument runs, house prices should rise in line with earnings.
Against this seemingly compelling argument, other factors are at work:
Changing demographics mean that the number of people in their 20s will fall
from 8.8m now to around 7.5m in 1999. This means fewer potential first-time
buyers.
The average UK household is still carrying debts equivalent to more than a
full year's income. This limits the potential for house-buyers to stoke up
the market by taking out larger mortgages.
Banks and building societies, which tightened their lending criteria through
recession, are still cautious.
Moreover, housing market forecasters disagree about how favourable the
economic outlook really is. Stockbroker UBS believes economic growth will
peak at 3.7 per cent in 1995 before falling back gently to 1.6 per cent in
1998. This leads it to expect average inflation of 6.5 per cent over the
period and annual average earnings' growth of 8.4 per cent. Against this
background, the UBS forecast that house prices will rise by 48 per cent over
the next five years - or 8 per cent a year - seems reasonable.
Yet, others are much more cautious about growth and inflation. The Halifax
building society expects inflation to average around 3 per cent to the end
of the decade and house prices to rise by perhaps 5 per cent annually. Both
UBS and Halifax see house prices broadly tracking average earnings, which
tend to run at 1-2 percentage points higher than the rate of retail price
inflation.
The forecasters themselves would admit that these numbers are of little help
to people looking for property in a particular region or price bracket. In
reality, the housing market is made up of many local markets which perform
according to local economic conditions.
The top end of the market, for instance, is only a very small proportion of
the whole - less than than 1 per cent of the UK's housing stock is valued at
over Pounds 300,000. But prices in this sector have shown a sharp recovery
already, even though the wider market is in the doldrums. According to agent
Savills, prime London properties have risen by 28 per cent since the market
trough in December 1992, with around 20 per cent growth this year.
The high bonuses earned by City professionals over the past year have helped
this recovery. Agents also report renewed interest among overseas buyers of
prime London property, although the role played by Russian mafia money has
been greatly exaggerated.
Even away from London, where foreign buyers and City bonuses are less
important, prices in the top tier have shown a marked recovery. Savills
estimates that country house prices have risen by 11 per cent in the past
two years, far outpacing the wider market.
The main reason for the rapid rise at the top end is shortage of supply. As
one agent remarked this week, the supply of 18th century country houses was,
by definition, 'inelastic'. Small changes in demand have a big impact on
prices.
If the outlook for the economy remains good, there is every chance that
prime residential property will continue to outperform the wider market.
The main risk is probably political: heavier taxation of high earners cannot
be ruled out if there is a change of government after the next general
election.
Meanwhile, estate agents everywhere are hoping that Clarke has no such
surprises in store on November 29.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Property: Sunny Cyprus, where the good life abounds - Gerald
Cadogan finds plenty to attract house and flat buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice is straightforward if you plan to buy a holiday or retirement
home in Cyprus: either a traditional village house, where you balance the
good points of an older property against the possible drawbacks of life in a
small community, or a house or apartment in an efficient new development.
Old houses are dearer and harder to find than a few years ago but still
attract do-it-yourself enthusiasts who are happy to spend years improving
the property - usually with help from local builders who speak English and
have probably worked in Britain.
The developments, with their swimming pools and newly-planted trees, are
plentiful and good value starting at around CPounds 27,000. (A Cypriot pound
is worth about Pounds 1.33 sterling).
People from the UK - including many British Cypriots - make up the majority
of foreign house-buyers. They find many familiar things. Social systems and
laws, even electric plugs, are much the same. Motorists drive on the left,
and the retired are entitled to buy a car duty-free.
Everybody speaks English and has a relative in the UK - usually north London
 -and much business is done in that language rather than Greek. Thanks to a
generous double taxation treaty, retired Britons can receive their pensions
free of any UK withholding tax and will pay Cypriot income tax at only 3 to
5 per cent, a tenth of the local rate, with the first CPounds 2,000 exempt.
Buying is surprisingly easy. Foreigners can purchase a flat or house with up
to two donums (2,675 sq metres) of land or a building plot not exceeding
that size. The island's Council of Ministers must give permission, but
normally this is a formality so long as you show an annual income of Pounds
8,000.
You must pay with funds brought into the country. If you decide to sell up
and leave, you can take the purchase price with you (plus any gain at a rate
of CPounds 10,000 a year).
You are liable to pay capital gains tax on any indexed profit above CPounds
10,000. The long-established land registry guarantees title.
The land registry's transfer fee (5 to 8 per cent of the declared value) is
unavoidable, as is 1.5 per cent stamp duty. Annual property taxes and
dustbin collection charges are low, however.
Possible water cuts to homes in the summer (which tourists in hotels do not
experience) are the only snag for buyers. Always inquire about the supply.
Paphos, in the south-west of the island, is good for new developments and
also has the advantage of its own airport. (The main one is at Larnaca, in
the south-east.) The beaches are sandy, the climate sunny and warm, and the
Roman mosaics stunning.
The Nicosia-Limassol motorway is advancing to Paphos. When it is finished in
two or three years, making it easy for Nicosia people to commute every
weekend, property prices are bound to rise, so now is a good time to buy.
Many have. 'There must be 5,000 Brits around Paphos,' says Michael
Cartwright of Leptos Estates, a Paphos-based developer which has built 6,000
units already.
Leptos bought 250 acres of hillside and planted them with trees to make
Kamares Village, where a two-bedroom detached villa may cost CPounds 56,000.
If you do it from scratch, plots start at CPounds 25,000 and building from
around CPounds 46,000. Owners have a clubhouse and pool. High and facing
west, Kamares is ideal for watching sunsets and is cooler than down by the
harbour.
Among other Paphos developments by Leptos is Tremythia Gardens. It is being
built around a clump of tremythia (pistachio) trees, which are a protected
species. Flat prices start at CPounds 27,000.
Another developer of repute is Cybarco, part of the Lanitis group of
companies, which has projects from Larnaca to Paphos. They include Asomatos
Villas (plots from CPounds 17,200 and villa construction from CPounds
58,000) in the orange plantations between Limassol and the British military
bases at Episkopi (army) and Akrotiri (RAF).
The smell is heavenly when the trees are in flower. In winter, flamingos
visit the Akrotiri salt lake.
Along the road to Paphos, the views from Cybarco's Pissouri Villas (CPounds
46,700 to CPounds 63,900), on the hill above Pissouri village, encompass
rich vine country, the sea and the Troodos massif where Cypriots escape to
be cool, eat trout and look at painted Byzantine churches.
In a traditional house, the basic unit is a long hall of stone or stone and
mud-brick. Roughly-shaped ceiling beams support a packing of clay and reeds
or straw. If there is an upper storey, it has a stone floor and a high
ceiling for coolness. The stairs are outside. Often, several of these
buildings, of different heights, are set around a courtyard.
If you can find one, a restored house can cost from CPounds 60,000 to
CPounds 80,000, says Paphos agent Renos Pitros. Unrestored, they are
cheaper, especially if inland. A CPounds 5,000 shell 20 miles from Paphos
could cost Pounds 25,000 near the town, with restoration costs of CPounds
20,000 to CPounds 30,000.
Further information: in Paphos - Cybarco (236 337), Leptos Estates (233 775)
and Renos Pitros (235 344). In London - Cybarco (071-436 3881) and Leptos

FT  05 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Frogs at home in urban ponds - Michael J. Woods on
a country dweller forced to change its habits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The advent of the zinc drinking trough fed by clean piped water, spelt the
end of field ponds on most farms. Some were simply neglected and allowed to
silt up, others were deliberately filled, adding field area to the farm and
allowing the removal of trees, which shaded crops.
Other ponds were allowed to fill with pollutants, such as silage effluent.
The outcome has been bad news for frogs along with other freshwater species.
Some areas of Britain have lost more than three-quarters of their farm ponds
in the past half century and there is now a dearth of frogs in the
countryside.
But where the country frog has lost, the town frog has gained, for the
popularity of garden ponds and the relative safety of gardens for amphibians
has ensured that the frog population has boomed in urban areas.
Many breeding adults successfully survive from year to year and, come the
spring, join their own progeny to lay spawn among the water lilies beneath
the spray of fountains and the stony gaze of fishing gnomes. In some ponds
there are fish to feed on the hatchlings, in others great diving beetles,
newts and even the larvae of dragonflies that have made their home there and
relish the spring harvest of tadpoles.
But ponds harbouring few predators, in areas where there is little to eat
the adults, have seen a population explosion of spawn which can be of such
magnitude that the pond almost becomes a single quivering mass of jelly.
Meanwhile those with new ponds are generally keen to see frogs move in and
many County Wildlife Trusts now run a scheme encouraging those with too much
spawn and those with little or none to get in touch with each other.
Frogs can live to be eight or nine but may take three years to reach sexual
maturity so that new ponds may need the introduction of spawn for up to
three years before frogs readily find and return to them.
At the same time, ponds must be cared for in order to prevent an
accumulation of dead leaves and to keep the water sufficiently oxygenated to
support tadpoles. Eventually, of course, the new owner has a seasoned,
well-used pond and may then become a donor of spawn.
Unfortunately, now that frogs are comparatively common in gardens, their
loss from the countryside is tending to go unnoticed.
But the loss of any pond is of concern to conservation organisations and to
the National Rivers Authority, which is keen on conserving ponds and the
wildlife which lives in them.
Ironically, desperate frogs, unable to find anywhere more suitable,
sometimes leave their spawn, unfertilised, in the new drinking troughs. But
at least this would be good news for the goldfish living in one trough I
know.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Property: Plotter's house for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How appropriate that the house where the gunpowder plot was organised comes
to market today, 389 years after Guy Fawkes tried to blow up King James I.
The house is at Ashby St Ledgers in Northamptonshire, and belonged to the
Catesby family. Robert Catesby, a stout Roman Catholic, held the planning
meeting in the gatehouse, tradition says.
When the plot failed, Catesby and the other conspirators rushed the 80 miles
from London to Ashby St Ledgers.
Much of the present house is the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens, albeit working
in a 17th century mode; but Catesby's house survives with fine 17th century
panelling, as does the half-timbered gatehouse.
Lutyens also designed the gardens which include a canal garden, statue
garden, temple and an early 20th century version of a packhorse bridge.
This imposing house with 32 acres has 10 bedrooms and numerous outbuildings.
The price from Lane Fox (01295-273592) is Pounds 2m.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Outdoors: Trees that make winter bearable - Gardening /
Ignore the part-timers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The tree season is ending in most people's gardens but not in mine, where my
favourites are at their best. They suit small or large gardens, they grow
anywhere and, apart from owner apathy or a rare attack of honey fungus,
nothing seems to bother them. And my top three have long seasons - they are
not limited to a fortnight's flower or only five months' leaf.
Those choosing trees need to know that they can be miserable part-timers.
Yes, mulberries are romantic, ash trees have been turning a seductive shade
of yellow and robinias are exciting because they flower. As a garden's main
trees, however, I disqualify all of them. They are so late into leaf that
they miss the main thrust of spring entirely. I do not want to look on the
bare branches of a mulberry as the garden's main focus in mid-May.
In smaller gardens, I would much rather look out on to sorbus Vilmorinii.
Never believe that sorbusses are nothing more than mountain ashes which can
be seen in any old garden. Vilmorinii has leaves which are cut prettily and,
in spring, open punctually to a fine greyish-green, while the main stem
stands up straight.
It belongs in a front garden, beside a small lawn, or on the edge of an
urban boundary. You can plant round and under it and you know it will not
grow much more than 10-12ft with a modest, open spread of branches. It
flowers late in May without being special but, just now, it is ending six
weeks of distinction. In autumn, Vilmorinii turns a bright reddish-purple
and covers itself with clusters of pink-white berries.
In a bigger garden, I would have to have the robust sorbus hupehensis, too,
for its bigger, greyer leaves and taller shape. Vilmorinii, however, seems
to be a better fruiter: its one fault this year is that young trees have
cropped so heavily that their upper stems have bent over and snapped.
While Vilmorinii's shape is upright and lightly branched, my second
favourite bends over and develops a rounded head. The malus family contains
dozens of good garden trees besides cultivated apples but, to my eye, malus
Red Sentinel is simply the best in a modest space.
Like all the family, it flowers freely in spring and fruits heavily in
autumn. The flowers, however, are not too harshly white, a failing which
afflicts several recent forms (including Everest, which I have just banished
from the main garden).
With time, other excellent maluses, especially the prolific Florabunda,
become upright and rather untidy. In its early years, Red Sentinel will seem
to droop, as if hit by a strong wind. Be patient, because it will broaden
out into a loosely-rounded head on a standard stem.
It has pretty leaves which do not become drab as summer advances and it has
particularly pretty scarlet fruits. So do some of the others, but Red
Sentinel is the one which will last in fruit from October right on into
March, trebling the interest in these difficult months.
By the end, the fruits are slightly battered, but I would much rather see
them than not. It is an excellent grower and, if you allow enough width for
its head, it would look charming anywhere.
My companion for it is taller but is about to enter its unsurpassed season
of duty. Last year, the winter cherries were amazingly beautiful in a winter
that never really brought a sharp frost to turn them brown. This year, the
omens look promising and, in three weeks, prunus subhirtella autumnalias
will be at its best.
In older age, the trees can become quite wide and tall; but you can always
prune them lightly and encourage them upwards, not outwards, if you are
worried they will overshadow too much of their surrounds. I would not be
deterred by lack of space from trying them at the edge of a front yard which
could stand a height up to 25ft after 12 years or so. Clipping can take care
of the sideways shading.
This wonderful tree remains my first choice and should not be excluded
because of its possible span when older. It is controllable. And nothing
else will give you such clouds of white flower waiting to be picked and
brought indoors (where they will last quite well), to be replaced by yet
more buds in intervals between the winter frosts.
There are other winter cherries, but only this variety has the ability to
send out yet more buds beyond the first flowers when they happen to be
caught in cold weather. Anyone can grow it and nurseries will supply it as a
bush, rather than a tree, if the dimensions bother you.
There is, however, one important bit of knowledge. This winter cherry also
has a pink form but, for some reason, it does not flower so promptly in the
winter and often refuses to open until early March. By then, it is only one
among many.
So, be sure to insist on the white-flowered form so that you do not lose the
five-month season of flower which puts this tree above any easily-grown
rival.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Modern art convalesces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for major works of Impressionist and modern art is currently
experiencing a long convalescence. In 1989 and 1990 it vigorously
over-exerted itself, culminating in May 1990 with a rush of blood to the
head which produced a record total for any art auction, Dollars 286m at
Sotheby's, and a record price for any work of art, Dollars 82.5m at
Christie's - for Van Gogh's portrait of his physician, Dr Gachet.
Within six months, demand, in particular Japanese demand which had fuelled
the excesses, had disappeared, and the market has been in severe shock ever
since. A year ago there were signs of revived spirits when a Matisse sold
for Dollars 13.75m, and in anticipation of a recovery in May in New York,
the auction houses gently raised their reserves and expectations. In the
event the results were disappointing: it was like a patient over-estimating
his strength. Next week's auctions in New York are more modest affairs, with
sales at Sotheby's and Christie's combined unlikely to reach Dollars 85m.
Still, as always, the auction houses look on the bright side. The hundreds
of Dollars 1m-plus paintings locked away in the vaults of Japanese companies
are not being off-loaded on to the market to cause a second collapse in
prices: their owners are reluctant to sell them cheaply and thus weaken
their overall asset values. And the serious collectors of Impressionist and
modern art are still interested.
But in this return to a non-speculative, connoisseur, market, buyers are
very selective: they are prepared to wait for the finest examples of an
artists' work at the best price. Anything second rate or less than fresh is
spurned. Unlike Christie's, Sotheby's sold most of its lots in New York in
May but 40 per cent went for below the low estimate.
So what of next week. The auctions are small - just 47 lots at Sotheby's, 59
at Christie's - and fairly modest. Prices generally are back to 1987 levels:
vendors have finally accepted that they cannot expect 1989 prices. This
means that few are anxious to sell: one of the main problems is an absence
of star items to kick-start confidence.
Every picture has its own price at the moment it is sold, but for
comparison's sake, a decorative small Picasso of a Harlequin and a monkey
sold for Dollars 2.4m in 1989, but is now estimated by Sotheby's at Pounds
800,000-Dollars 1m. But one of the most important paintings in the auction,
Miro's 'Femme de la nuit' estimated at up to Dollars 4.5m, sold for Dollars
2.5m in 1986. Miro is an artist whose reputation has risen in the past
decade.
The most appealing painting at Sotheby's, and the most expensive, is one of
Modigliani's last portraits of his mistress Jeanne Hebuterne. She already
looks pregnant, as she was when she committed suicide a few days after the
artist's own death. It carries a Dollars 5m plus estimate but this is one of
the best full-length Modigliani's to have appeared in recent years.
The highlight at Christie's is a Monet 'Waterlilies'. He painted the pond in
his retirement home at Giverny hundreds of times but this is a rare circular
format, one of only four, and Christie's hopes for between Dollars
4m-Dollars 6m, a modest estimate considering the last, conventionally
shaped, example made Dollars 12m in 1991. The painting was acquired in 1946
by Miss Alice Tully, one of Manhattan's leading art patrons, from the French
playwright Sacha Guitry, who bought it from Monet in 1914. Thus its
provenance is excellent.
Christie's will be very anxious over this lot for it guaranteed Tully's
heirs around Dollars 25m to secure the fixtures and fittings of her New York
apartment. In a reversal of approach, Sotheby's is now reluctant to
undertake financial risks in acquiring desirable properties for sale while
Christie's is still prepared to take a gamble. If the Monet does not sell,
Christie's is stuck with it. Fortunately Tully's furniture sold well last
week so it can afford to take slightly less for this, her most important
picture.
This week the auction room's sold major contemporary art in New York. This
usually gives an indicator to the Impressionist sales but the signals were
mixed, with Christie's having much the better evening. It brought in Dollars
14.56m (Pounds 8.8m) with 96 per cent of the pictures selling by value and
88 per cent by lot, an almost unprecedented success. Andy Warhol's silk
screen portrait 'Shot Red Marilyn', so called because a would be assassin
shot the picture rather than the artist, made Dollars 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m),
above target and not far off the Dollars 4.07m it fetched in 1989 at the
market peak.
In contrast, Sotheby's sold its top lot, Roy Lichtenstein's 'Pop' art icon,
'I . . I'm Sorry', for Dollars 2.47m. (Pounds 1.5m.), but 40 per cent of the
66 lots on offer were unsold.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Connoisseurs come in from the cold - Speculators have
disappeared from the auction rooms as collectors return
</HEADLINE>

The art and antiques trade continues to bump along in a repressed rather
than a depressed state. There is little action, but prices are certainly not
slipping down lower. The biggest quality fair of the year, Olympia in June,
did well, with a record attendance of over 37,500 and estimated sales in
excess of Pounds 21m. Dealers, major buyers at Olympia, are obviously now
optimistic enough to indulge, at last, in some re-stocking.
The first important event of the autumn season, the 20th Century British Art
Fair, was the most successful for four years, with over 1,000 works sold,
and there have been some strong auctions, most notably the country house
sales, where as usual buyers went berserk trying to secure a memento of the
Big House, however banal. Stokesay Court in Shropshire, promoted as a
Victorian time capsule, brought in Pounds 4.2m as against Sotheby's Pounds
2.5m estimate.
Routine sales in London in traditional areas, such as Old Masters, have
proved disappointing, but specialist auctions, such as Judge Bayne-Powell's
collection of miniatures, enjoyed strong collector bidding, with a 1645
miniature by Samuel Cooper selling for Pounds 89,500 as against a Pounds
25,000 top estimate.
It was a keen collector who paid the record price for a Dinky toy at
Christie's South Kensington, Pounds 12,650 for a 1930s delivery van bearing
the name of Bentall's. This is typical: speculators have completely
disappeared and traditional connoisseurs are sniffing the air again.
German art, especially the 20th century Expressionists, has ridden the
recession better than most. Christie's second annual auction in London in
this area brought in Pounds 7.7m and set artist records for Kirchner,
Corinth, Liebermann, and Jawlensky. But almost 30 per cent of the lots were
unsold, underlining the selectivity of buyers.
This weekend the pace picks up with the Kensington Antiques Fair, one of the
best established seasonal events, the draw at Kensington Town Hall while,
for the first time, the foyer of the Royal Festival Hall on South Bank acts
as home to the Contemporary Art Society Market. Every year anyone seriously
interested in contemporary art makes a point of visiting this show where
well-known artists (this year's crop includes Bridget Riley, Maggi Hambling,
Damien Hurst, Rachel Whiteread, and more) offer works priced between Pounds
100 and Pounds 2,000, with the CAS taking 30 per cent of the proceeds to
spend on buying art for galleries. On the first morning 150 items sold for
Pounds 80,000, but the work on the walls is constantly replaced.
Later this month, from November 16-22, the autumn Olympia starts. This fair
has quickly established itself as a popular event, with around 230 dealers,
many from the regions, taking space. Most exhibitors are offering a range of
antiques priced between Pounds 50 and Pounds 5,000, directed towards
Christmas shoppers.
The art market is acting as a faithful reflector of the economy - people are
becoming more prosperous, but are reluctant to spend. Earlier this year,
furniture sales benefited from the bonuses paid by certain City finance
houses, with young executives spending some of their windfalls on choice
Georgian and 19th century items, but 1994 has not been so prosperous in the
City. Until the house market improves substantially, the demand for general
decorative antiques will remain weak.
But at least the message is getting across that antiques make excellent
furnishings, of better craftsmanship than modern examples and likely to
hold, if not increase, in value. Sotheby's, which at one time was preparing
to stop selling low-priced items, is doing very well with its Colonnade
auctions, where few lots sell for more than Pounds 2,000. It brings new
young buyers into the auction rooms, the private buyers who have underpinned
the market in recent years.
Bonham's and Christie's, South Kensington, which specialise in this area,
showed the greatest expansion last season, and Phillips, the largest player
in this field with its network of regional auction rooms, also returned to
growth, with its busiest autumn in prospect for four years.
The problems at Lloyd's have made surprisingly little impact: there have
been fewer forced sales than anticipated, but those Lloyd's Names who
annually invested their bonuses in a painting or a Sheraton desk are notably
absent. Cork Street, home to many of London's leading dealers in modern and
contemporary art, was a traditional hunting ground for the culturally
inclined Names, and they have been much missed there.
But Cork Street has risen to the occasion by marketing itself more
energetically, and on November 26 and 27 there is the third annual Open
Weekend, with 19 galleries, from the mighty Waddingtons to the Atrium
Bookshop, open for business all day Saturday and Sunday, putting on a happy,
welcoming face.
One lesson the art and antiques trade has absorbed is that collectors are
not prepared to spend lavishly at the moment. Leading dealers are
concentrating on decorative works by popular artists, priced very
competitively. Old Bond Street dealer Frost &amp; Reed is preparing for
pre-Christmas buying with a December show offering a selection of works of
art all priced below Pounds 5,000.
Across the road, Agnew's has works by Whistler and Roussel, but prints
rather than paintings. The biggest London dealer, Richard Green, is
currently offering the ever popular Edward Seago while Colnaghi's has
temporarily abandoned Old Masters in favour of watercolours by Wefe Deliss.
Another established name, Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox is showing contemporary
portrait painters, including John Ward and John Sergeant, with an average
price of around Pounds 5,000.
Roy Miles has the leading contemporary Russian artist, Sergei Chepik, who
works in a traditional format, while Marlborough Graphics is offering new
etchings on the theme of nursery rhymes by Paula Rego.
Anyone wanting to see the cutting edge of contemporary art can visit the
Tate, where the short-listed artists for the Turner Prize are currently on
show, but in the main this is a time of retrenchment, of massaging back to
life nervous traditional buyers while hoping that enough of the new rich,
who are surely out there, will catch the collecting bug.
The art world has experienced so many false dawns of a market revival that
it has almost given up hope of a substantial upturn. It might have to settle
for a slowly appreciating trade, built on connoisseurs rather than
speculators, and less inclined to be seduced by a trend. It makes for a less
profitable business but a more firmly based one.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Romeo without a ray of romance - Sarah Hemming catches
a bleak, brutal portrayal of Shakespeare's tragedy at the Barbican
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To say that the first production in the Barbican's Everybody's Shakespeare
Festival might not be to everybody's taste is putting it mildly. Karin
Beier's Romeo und Julia from the Dusseldorfer Schauspielhaus is a bleak,
brutal reading of Shakespeare's tragedy in which no ray of romance ever
pierces the despair. Set not in medieval Verona, but in a sort of giant grey
underpass - not unlike the Barbican car park - it presents us with a chic,
harsh world where Romeo and Juliet's affair is simply a rebellion that
misfires.
It is a coherent reading, the interpretation of a young director (Beier is
29) who uses the play to explore the empty world of contemporary, alienated
youth. In a recent interview she described how she wanted to capture the
mood of wealthy young Germans driven to fill their empty lives by seeking
sensation in dangerous rituals and her production emphasises the violence in
the play. Romeo and Juliet's story is played out against the background of
gang warfare, as groups of youths rove around the town, spoiling for a fight
and engaging in bizarre martial manoeuvres. For them the urge to destroy is
paramount and death is the ultimate thrill. Tybalt becomes an arrogant,
taunting neo-fascist; Mercutio a cynical desperado, so bent on
self-destruction that he deliberately falls on Tybalt's knife and even
reappears as a ghost in Mantua to goad the exiled Romeo towards suicide.
No one is likeable. While the adolescent world is violent and rebellious,
that of the adults is fatuous and hypocritical. Even the nurse is played as
an unsympathetic raunchy blonde, while Friar Laurence becomes a dubious,
scarfaced individual and the prince is a babyish fop. In places this staging
makes for impressive set pieces: the ball is a skillfully choreographed
parade of garish grotesques, the fight a disturbing fray that conveys well
the thrill of adrenalin. But it is horribly relentless. In this decadent,
comfortless world there is no where for the teenagers to turn, and no room
for subtlety, warmth or emotion.
However bleak, all this might be just bearable if Romeo and Juliet
themselves ran counter to the mood. But in this profoundly nihilistic
staging, the tenderness and poetry is stripped out of even their encounters
and they emerge a rather gormless pair. The balcony scene is played on two
trapezes: giant swings, suspended over the concrete, emphasise how close to
childhood they still are, suggest the yearning for excitement and operate as
a metaphor for the unattainability of love. Even here, however, death is
seen as the ultimate kick, as they discuss who would make the bigger 'splat'
if they fell from their perches. Love scarcely makes an entrance.
At this point the subversion of the classic interpretation is quite funny,
but as it goes on, it becomes tedious, depressing and empty. Arriving at
Friar Laurence's cell, Juliet teases Romeo with glimpses of her black bra;
when they wake from their marriage night they squabble petulantly over
whether they heard the nightingale or the lark. And in the final instance of
this insistently anti-romantic production, Romeo changes his mind at the
last moment and tries to vomit up the poison he has swallowed.
Shakespeare's lovers may be too romantic for this age, but his story of two
innocents pitted against a violent and corrupt society has a trajectory that
is lost here. Take away that, and you take away the tragedy. Here, as Romeo
dies retching, there is not a wet eye in the house.
Final performance at the Barbican Theatre tonight (071-638 8891).

   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Everybody's Shakespeare International Festival shared by the Royal
Shakespeare Company and its host the Barbican Centre managed to run two
versions of Romeo and Juliet simultaneously on Wednesday and Thursday. While
the Dusseldorfer Schauspielhaus actors swinging on their swings were
presenting their German-speaking Romeo und Julia at Barbican Theatre, the
members of the London Symphony Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich in
Barbican Hall were playing a selection of Prokofiev's famous music for a
(1939) ballet of the play, with spoken commentaries interpolated between the
ten numbers by the actor Michael Feast.
Who selected the music from Prokofiev's own two suites and who the text  -
which melded prosaic summaries of the action with Shakepeare's glittering
poetry - we were not informed, but the result was a reasonably satisfying
dramatic whole, albeit marred by Feast's sometimes over-obvious actorly
pauses and by moments of brutal bathos. After the axe-like orchestral blows
of 'The Death of Tybalt' we did not need to be told that Tybalt had died.
The music is better left unglossed, especially as it was bringing out the
golden best of the orchestra. The beautifully soaring cellos, the melting
celesta, the guest leader Yuri Torchinsky's fetching solo contribution to an
altogether wonderfully realised balcony nocturne, the unprecedentedly
blood-curdling tuttis - all was sonorous magic in Rostropovich's carefully
measured account.
Earlier we had had Balakirev's rarely heard King Lear overture - an example
of the blunt Russification of Shakespeare to add to Tchaikovsky's powerfully
simplifying overtures - and Shostakovich's suite, Op. 32a, from his
incidental music to what apparently was a highly facetious (1932) production
of a Russian-speaking Hamlet by Nikolai Pavlovich Akimov. These 13 wittily
serviceable numbers are not much more interesting as pure music than
Shostakovich's 1959 musical Cheryomushki, recently revived at the
Hammersmith Lyric; but they deliver the authentic smart smack of early
Shostakovich, and are doubtless worth an occasional outing, certainly when
done with the LSO's verve.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: A rich and raunchy western - David Murray on
Greenaway's first foray into opera, 'Rosa'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Amsterdam the Netherlands Opera has scored yet another up-to-date success
with Rosa, a 'horse opera' by Peter Greenaway and Louis Andriessen.
Greenaway is of course the controversial film-maker, here engaging with
opera for the first time; Andriessen is the senior Dutch contemporary
composer, who has tried opera (or music-theatre) before, but never perhaps
with a co-author so exacting.
For Greenaway has not only directed Rosa in the most precise and rigorous
detail; just as with his films he has written it too, with the essential
visual imagery already prescribed. That would seem to reduce the composer's
role to supplying a 'film music' accompaniment to order. So it might, with a
composer less truculently himself than Andriessen; but in fact the
Andriessen persona (abrasive, quasi-minimalist and hard-hitting, but with
warm feelings) is stamped all over the score.
Though it answers to Greenaway's exact demands, it goes beyond his text by
infusing it with red blood - something that Michael Nyman's scores for all
but his most recent films hardly did, despite their wayward appeal. Here the
story is in his characteristic mode: tantalisingly intricate and incomplete,
lubricious but beady-eyed.
The gist of it is that young Esmeralda, wedded to a composer-cowboy who
prefers his horse, strives ecstatically to become one herself. Since this
erotic fantasy is told from various times and points of view, and
furthermore the wild West films for which the composer writes all his music
soon invade the stage and even the action, the built-in visual opportunities
are rich and raunchy.
Naturally Greenaway misses none of them, and his results are no less
striking than candidly reminiscent of his films. Terrific projections, fluid
interplay between film (period monochrome, modern colour, purpose-made
sequences too) and live-action, everything coolly stylised; economical with
props - but the rehearsal costs, including the hi-tech element, must have
been fearful. As it happens, some of the principals also spend a lot of time
in the nude, with or without splodges of black ink, and some of the busy
octet-ensemble are bare-bottomed throughout. Par for the course: as I said,
this is an up-to-date success.
Andriessen's score throbs relentlessly, as is his wont. His principals are
chiefly required to sing very loudly, clearly and rhythmically, in various
states of undress, but Marie Angel, Lyndon Terracini and Miranda van
Kralingen all do much more than that, and Roger Smeets, Christopher Gillett
and Phyllis Blanford make something crisp of their near-puppet roles. The
only part of the piece that remains flat is the mock investigation into the
murder: absurd to taunt the audience about getting the clues, when so few of
them were audible anyway. Contrariwise, Andriessen's pastiches of
film-Western triumph and rescue are funny and stirring.
Another British arrival in Amsterdam was John Eliot Gardiner the next night
 -not by any means his first visit, but his first to conduct the Royal
Concertgebouw Orchestra in their own splendid hall, where they usually sound
even better than elsewhere. They sounded particularly beautiful in Debussy's
three orchestral Images; they hardly needed Gardiner to teach them the
music, but his attention to delicate, unfamiliar detail was constantly
rewarding.
Whimsically, the Images were strewn through the programme, interlarded with
Hungarian scores. The temperate Dutch players were slightly short of snap in
Bartok's Dance Suite and Kodaly's Psalmus Hungaricus (with Keith Lewis a
lusty soloist), but these were sumptuous, well-balanced performances. The
sharpest impression was left by Gyorgy Kurtag's four-minute elegy, Grabstein
fur Stephan. A guitar gently strums basic chords as if tuning up, changing
one note from time to time, while around it the orchestra sketches sighs and
whimpers over a doomy bass tread. Less minimal than much Kurtag, and
poignantly heartfelt.
Nine more Rosa performances at the Musiektheater between tonight and
November 28; Concertgebouw concert repeated November 6

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Bouncers' at the Riverside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Much of our most important fringe theatre occurs in the London Borough of
Hammersmith, which contains the Bush Theatre, the Lyric Theatre's Studio
Theatre, and the three auditoria of the Riverside Studios. Right now,
Riverside - under new management and with a new facade - has become again
one of London's most important theatrical venues, valuable not least for
bringing the city several of the most important shows seen during the
Edinburgh Festival.
John Godber's Bouncers - as performed by Godber's own company Hull Truck -
is in Studio 2. Few Londoners realise quite how vital a part of British
theatre Godber is today. Various Godber plays are staged by numerous
regional theatres; and like Alan Ayckbourn, Godber writes plays conceived
practically for regional small or medium-scale theatres. The success of
April in Paris, which came to the West End for several months earlier this
year, reminds us that he is by no means 'merely' regional.
Bouncers is a finer, darker, and more complex work than April in Paris. It
is a social satire about clubs and clubbing, and it looks the grimmest
aspects of club life in the face. Yes, it shows us homophobia, misogyny,
crass promiscuity, male aggression, sexual competitiveness. I was surprised
to find how often it reminded me of the work of Steven Berkoff and how much
more humane and subtle it invariably proved. Godber can make us laugh and
shudder at the most grotesque depths of behaviour - men side by side at the
pissoir, girls blatantly showing their sexual availability, gruesome jokes
about snot and other excrescences, bouncers obliging each other to watch
porno movies as a male-bonding ritual - but part of what is rare in his work
is its eventual tenderness. He shows us human beings at their worst, and
then he reminds us that, for all their fatuity, they are still utterly
human. A misogynistic bouncer suddenly remarks 'Women. Weird. Why? They
laugh at yer when you're naked' - and suddenly his vulnerability, which
Godber leaves hanging in the air, becomes as interesting as, and connected
to, his misogyny.
Another rare feature of Godber's work is its selflessness. He does not draw
attention to his own cleverness or wit; he simply keeps drawing our
attention to new facets of his subject. The four performers in the current
Hull Truck touring production do virtuoso stuff in changing persona - each
one is a bouncer, a club girl, a club boy in turn, if not other roles too.
But virtuosity is not the point of the show; transparency is. Damien Cruden
directs; all four men - Chris Walker, Peter McNally, John Kirk and oh]
especially the hilarious Andrew Williams - give performances that are at
times astonishingly acute in the way they dissolve themselves into their
various grim, funny, tough, hopeless, wounded characters.
A few blocks north is the Bush Theatre, which is just about as important as
the Royal Court for presenting new plays. As part of the London New Play
Festival, it is currently showing Two Horsemen, a 65-minute one-acter by
'Biyi Bandele-Thomas (author of the recent award-winning Resurrections). Two
Horsemen is one of those waiting-for-Godot existential affairs in which
nothing happens to two men as they talk about life, death, resurrection,
gender, sex, farting, and identity. The two men (acted by Colin McFarlane
and Leo Wringer) are black, but their sense of identity changes during the
play. They seem to commute between various lives even while they seem
suspended in one eternal present, and occasionally they refer to themselves
as female. The mixture of poetry, mystery, humour, and scatology is always
arresting, and the play (directed by Roxana Silbert) receives a warm hand
from its audience. But the taste it leaves in the mouth is ultimately
contrived, fancy, precious.
Bouncers is at the Riverside Studios, W6, until December 3; Two Horsemen is
at the Bush, W12, until November 19

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: 'Beauty' is mocked and betrayed - Clement Crisp is
appalled at the crassly wrong-headed new production of this great ballet at
Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sleeping Beauty is the greatest of ballets. Its score is Tchaikovsky's
masterpiece. Its choreography, responding to that score, is a summation of
the ideals of the classic academic dance as it was brought to its zenith in
Imperial St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa. It is a work of its time and place
 -essentially, I suppose, the final and most nostalgic statement about the
art of a dying empire. It is the product of a francophile culture, yet it
reflects both the grandeur and the humanity of scale of its ravishing native
city, and even of the theatre that gave it birth, the Mariinsky, so perfect
in its architectural ordering.
For ballet-goers, it enshrines every virtue that the word 'classic' can mean
to dancing. Petipa's choreography as it has come down to us proclaims the
merits of formal order, harmony, of movement serenely shaped in space,
occupying space with both liveliness and decorum. The action of the ballet
as it was first given in 1890 - and we have clear evidence of its text - was
superb in balance, as grandly spacious as the imperial world and ideal to
which it was a homage. Its score was no less beautiful in shape, each scene,
each act, most carefully considered as musical architecture.
Nothing in Beauty is distorted, extreme, vulgar, unreasoned. Ultimately, it
proposes attitudes of moral distinction - Virgil Thomson called them 'twin
privileges, freedom and responsibility' - which must guide classic creation
and interpretation. The academic dance of Petipa insisted on this. The
academic dance of our century, of Balanchine, Ashton, held it no less true,
whatever developments in manner might supervene. Beauty must remain for
performers, producers, audiences, an example of clarity, formal dignity,
rule of order.
On Thursday night the Royal Ballet unveiled its new Beauty at Covent Garden,
the production having been first seen in America during the summer. Beauty
has a special place in the company's history. With extraordinary prescience,
Ninette de Valois gained a first staging in 1939 for her then immature
company - it was just eight years old. The text was correct even if the
forces (and the design) were not up to their task. By 1946, and the
re-opening of Covent Garden after the war, de Valois could bring her company
to glory and our grandest theatre. Beauty, splendidly designed by Oliver
Messel, announced to the world - and to America in 1949 when the troupe made
its New York debut - that Britain had a national ballet. The production
honoured its text. It educated dancers in the greatest challenges of their
art. It taught audiences to love classic ballet. Over succeeding years,
other versions were presented, none so illuminatingly right as the 1946
version. That staging, with its Bibiena architecture and its sense of space,
gave the dance and dramatic action room to breathe, to take proper and
happiest shape.
The new staging we now see is by Anthony Dowell, in his time the purest of
classicists as Prince Florimund, with design by Maria Bjornson, who has
worked in opera, musicals, drama. Dowell has preserved much of the old
choreography on the immediate terms of step and pattern. Miss Bjornson has
decorated it in a manner so crassly wrong-headed, so vulgar, that we no
longer see The Sleeping Beauty, but a cross between a Folies Bergere show
and a pantomime. The ballet has been degraded, mocked, destroyed.
It is beyond understanding that Dowell should have countenanced design which
is malignly determined to unbalance every harmony that shapes Beauty.
Bjornson has contrived a permanent frame of vertiginous and skewed pillars
which collapse towards a central oval, or lead to a dizzying perspective of
an open gallery. Hectoring in visual terms, this disastrous scheme
effectively pulls the eye away from the stage action. Costuming is fussy,
garish, or winsomely pallid, fatuous in outline (the Queen comes on in the
first act as Mistinguett), ill-judged in effect. Historical identity -
Bjornson seems to have dipped into A girl's first book of baroque motifs
with no great success  - and fairy-tale magic are equally unlovely in
realisation. (Part of the fascination of Beauty lies in the mingling of the
real - evoking the court of Louis XIV - with fairy magic, and the subliminal
presence of the greater theme of beauty cursed to a winter sleep and then
awakening to love and new life).
Nothing is visually right about the staging. Not one moment has the power or
the grace implicit in score or choreography, because everything is betrayed
by Miss Bjornson's tasteless caprices. (Lest anyone think I am too severe, I
would refer ballet-lovers to the video of the Kirov staging as performed by
Irina Kolpakova: designs unemphatic but serenely right frame performances
that breathe and flower in the stage space. Choreography, interpretation,
style, have a common dignity and illuminating force.) At Covent Garden, the
dance now battles against a vertiginous, maladroit setting, trapped in
costuming either flimsy or clever-clever. Performances seem unsettled,
unseated, by this decorative mayhem. The prologue is dominated by a vast
table whose only justification is to allow Carabosse's creatures to scamper
and riot on it, while a set of chairs shake, rattle and roll. That it
encroaches upon the dancing space is an even greater flaw: the sublime
patterns of the dance look cramped. The first act boasts a vast oval frame
through which Aurora must gingerly enter - gone that colonnaded view of the
young princess which has traditionally been one of ballet's most thrilling
moments. The second act is a winter hunting scene having an air of austerity
and acid, vehement colouring, with the court dances curtailed so that the
prince may have an unnecessary solo, for which Tchaikovsky sounds oddly
souped-up. (And the prince's tutor is dressed as Smike). The last act - the
apotheosis of everything Beauty means - looks like a pretentious
hairdresser's establishment with too few clients: the court is distinctly
sparse in numbers.
Dowell's production has, and with good cause, a harried and browbeaten air.
The Prologue's formal splendour - it should be like a Le Notre garden - is
defeated by its design and by performances fidgety rather than radiant. (And
I here register a protest at the intermimable clatter of thunder played over
Tchaikovsky's score to announce Carabosse's arrival: it is symptomatic of
the staging that it does not trust the music. That Carabosse was played by
Dowell himself as a captious drag-queen is another matter).
Grace of means, that prerequisite of the academic dance, was rarely apparent
in the first night performances. Viviana Durante made a pretty, delicate and
capable Aurora, but - not surprisingly - her interpretation seemed
over-shadowed by the surroundings and lacked nobility of scale. Her prince
was Zoltan Solymosi, whose provincial manner and brash technique I do not
admire in this ballet. The Lilac Fairy of Benazir Hussein was strong but
singularly charmless. There were brightnesses amid the flurries of fabric
and tinsel - the three jewel fairies of the last act seemed delightful - but
casts are going to have a difficult time telling us about The Sleeping
Beauty in this unreasoned, unreasoning caricature.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: In search of some simple common sense - William Packer
reviews the work of the four contenders for the Turner Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hot on the heels of the inaugural Jerwood Prize, which set itself to work a
field which the Turner has long left assiduously uncultivated - current
British painting - the Turner Prize itself comes round again.
There was nothing wrong with the Jerwood that the simple application of some
common sense could not have remedied, or should not get right next time. But
that exactly has been the case with the Turner Prize these many years. Is
common sense still so rare a commodity? With a representative display of the
work of the four artists short-listed for this year's prize now on view at
the Tate - the winner will be announced, and the spondulicks, all Pounds
20,000 of them, dished out at the party on November 22 - we have our annual
chance to see for ourselves.
Has anything changed? The age-limit of 50 remains, which prevents the Turner
from ever being an award of truly national standing and consequent
international prestige. Yet something of that order was always intended and
is still claimed. The test should surely rest on how artists stand with
artists of any age. If a young artist then wins, the better for him.
As to the range this short-list covers, the now usual four is a narrow
number, and the representation no less narrow and predictable within its
avant-garde orthodoxy. There are two sculptors, one painter and one
video-maker: plus ca change . . .
The painter is Peter Doig (35), and a landscape painter at that, but he is
no pillar of the Royal Academy. His inclusion is not to be justified simply
by what might be done sitting in a field and painting the trees. Rather it
must be set out in terms of 'changing perceptions of reality', 'tension
between representative or narrative content . . . and purely visual,
decorative and abstract qualities', 'banal sources', 'imaginative triggers'
or 'fertile interplay'.
The paintings themselves, innocuous enough, are conventionally large, their
imagery freely reworked upon photographic sources into atmospheric and
expressionist evocations of winter lakes and forests and, latterly,
Corbusier blocks of flats.
Sculptors have dominated the Turner lists for many years, supplying the last
six winners out of nine. Here are two more. Antony Gormley (44) shows his
now familiar featureless figures, cast in grotesque and repetitive
simplicity from his own body and disposed in bizarre postures about the room
and ceiling. 'My body', he says, 'is the channel through which all
impressions of the world come, and I want to use it to carry feeling back
into the world.'
The exhibition booklet goes on to tell us, just a shade ponderously, that
his work 'meditates on the relationship between our spiritual and physical
selves.'
Shirazeh Houshiary (39) was born in Persia, and her work has always been
'informed by Sufi poetry and ancient writings from East and West on . . .
mathematics, philosophy, religion, art and astronomy.' She has moved away in
recent years from the organic reference of her earlier abstracted forms and
vessels, and is now showing a work comprised of metal boxes, 'The Enclosure
of Sanctity', that variously represents the planets.
Each box has a structured and segmented interior, established upon 'grids
corresponding to numbers with which each planet is identified.' Some are
richly decorated, some are not. 'Through studying these cubes', she says,
'we can realise the multiplicity of the state of existence.' She is also
showing a group of minimalist canvases that are inscribed with delicately
calligraphic images.
Which leaves the radical or conceptual slot to Willie Doherty (35), who
works with photography and video and comes from Derry. His work here, 'The
Only Good One is a Dead One', consists of two videotapes, one a long static
shot of a street corner at night, the other of an endless drive at night
through country lanes with only the pool of light visible ahead. It is
accompanied by a ironical monologue, as though the driver were both gunman
and target reflecting upon the inevitability of violent death.
It is a polemical, narrative piece, born of close personal experience of the
Troubles, and effective enough within its own terms. Yet is it the form or
only the content that gives such work its force? 'In all his work', says the
booklet, 'he attempts with moving clarity and honesty to convey the
complexities of the situation.'
These, then, are the runners in what is more open and equal a race than
usual. Gormley must be the clear favourite, Doig in with a good chance and
Doherty and Miss Houshiary the outsiders, with Doherty the better each-way
bet. For my money? Well, it stays in my pocket.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: Buster Keaton jazzed up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Frisell's guitar playing has always been out of kilter with the
mainstream, so it seems quite natural that now he should be applying it to
silent film. Commissioned by a New York arts centre to write new scores for
a set of Buster Keaton silents, the elliptical tunes which resulted met with
such approval from US audiences that he did more, and then recorded some
too. In this European tour he brings his regular band of Joey Baron (drums)
and Kermit Driscoll (bass) to accompany three of the best, the short
classics Go West, The High Sign and One Week.
To play alongside great American film is a natural progression for
42-year-old Frisell. He has a passion for popular American music and recent
recordings have covered works from such diverse sources as Madonna, Charles
Ives, Sonny Rollins and de Sousa. With musical anarchist John Zorn, he has
collaborated in coruscating improvisation where Mickey Spillane's gangster
yarns were the inspiration.
In Keaton's deadpan hilarity, the American modernist has another ideal
setting for his own cynical humour. The music, like Keaton's visual art, is
fundamentally melancholic, but filled out with pratfalls and gags. The
guitarist's playing combines a concentration on melody that reveals a
background as a clarinettist and a love of dissonance that comes from
listening to Hendrix. Frisell's studied way with solos mirrors Keaton's
modus operandi of 'Think slow, act fast'.
You might guess from this that the trio's music for films is anything but
easy, and any preconceptions based on the traditional ragtime, lid-slamming
treatment of silent films were quickly dispersed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall
on Wednesday. Frisell comes equipped with two electric guitars, one looking
as though it has been in a car smash, the other shrunk in the wash. There
are no fierce guitar licks where you might expect Frisell to join the car
chase, and there are no wah-wah sounds when Keaton see-saws on the ladder.
Instead, using the volume pedal to gently turn notes on and off, Frisell
quietly captures the sadness and romanticism of the scenes as they roll by.
The rhythm section orientates the score, Baron providing some essential
rat-tat-tat and Driscoll moving the whole along but Frisell's self-contained
sound is forever following The Great Stone Face's body language.
Hard to take on its own, the coupling is what multi-media was made for.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Arts: A lifetime in opera - Andrew Clark talks to outspoken
Czech conductor Bohumil Gregor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a matter of national pride: Bohumil Gregor, doyen of Czech opera
conductors, finds fault with Elijah Moshinsky's staging of The Bartered
Bride, which he is to conduct in Geneva over the next two weeks. 'Maybe I'm
too old,' says Gregor, 68, who first conducted Smetana's opera in Prague in
the late 1940s, 'but Mr Moshinsky doesn't understand Smetana. Stage
directors today don't seem to care what the composer is saying. The works
are being misused. Smetana knew more about drama than Mr Moshinsky will ever
know.'
Fortunately, Moshinsky is not present to hear Gregor's criticism. The
production - first performed by English National Opera in the mid-1980s -
has been restaged for Geneva by ENO staff producer David Ritch, who has made
discreet changes to suit Gregor's taste. Gregor signed his contract without
knowing that the setting had been updated. He says Moshinsky took extreme
liberties with the text, and that the costumes are more Russian than Czech.
With that thunderblast out of the way, Gregor settles down to reflect on a
lifetime in opera. He began his career in 1945 playing double bass in the
orchestra of the Grand Theatre of the Fifth of May, the avant-garde Prague
company which launched the careers of numerous Czech artists in the postwar
era. Gregor made his conducting debut in 1947 with Madama Butterfly, and
quickly picked up a core repertory of Italian, French and Czech operas.
He was surrounded by singers and conductors who were the living embodiment
of Czech operatic tradition. Many had been engaged by leading contemporaries
of Janacek, and were able to pass on unique insights. 'There was no formal
instruction, but you could learn a lot if you had the ears - just sitting in
the canteen while they discussed how they had sung this or that. The
tradition was alive in the building  - for me it was like mother's milk.'
After gaining further experience in Brno and Ostrava, Gregor returned to
Prague in 1962 with a reputation as a Janacek specialist. He conducted From
the House of the Dead during the National Theatre's ground-breaking trip to
the Edinburgh Festival in 1964. Guest contracts in Stockholm, Hamburg and
San Francisco quickly followed. He also began a 20-year association with the
Netherlands Opera. His pioneering Janacek recordings on Supraphon date from
this period.
British musicians on the continent who have worked with Gregor draw
comparisons between his approach to Janacek and Reginald Goodall's to
Wagner: they speak of the same undertow of feeling, developed through long
study, patient coaching of singers and a stubborn insistence on proper
rehearsal conditions. But Gregor says instinct has always played the most
important part.
'If you just have the score, you're lost. In performance it never turns out
quite as written, because Janacek does not make clear the differences in
tempo. He'll use one general marking for fast or slow, leaving you to work
out the tempo relationships and make certain decisions for yourself. You
have to use your knowledge of his style to work out how it should sound. He
used this nonsense word scasovka (cas = time) - you won't find it in the
dictionary. But if you break the word up, it has something to do with 'the
connection of two times' - it's quite clear he was talking about tempi. It's
part of the oddity of Janacek.'
Gregor says there is no fundamental difference in the way he conducts
Janacek, Smetana or Dvorak. 'They all drew on the same material - the melody
of language. Words provided the inspiration for music. Janacek was the first
to articulate it, but Smetana used it without realising. Listen to Kecal
singing about money in The Bartered Bride, or the way Dvorak puts the stress
on certain words in The Devil and Kate: it's exactly how you would speak it.
You also find the roots of Martinu's polyrhythmic style in Smetana's dances.
That kind of rhythmic subtlety is in our national musical character.'
Out of favour at home, Gregor and his wife Blanka spent most of the 1970s
and 1980s abroad. Only after the 1989 Velvet Revolution did he discover that
the National Theatre's former Communist boss, Premysl Koci, had saved him
from denunciation. 'He wrote in my official file that I was to be left alone
because I was unbalanced and a little crazy  - it was like something out of
Kafka] He could be a very unpleasant man, but in his heart he loved the
theatre and tried to help the people who worked there.'
Over the past five years Gregor has done what he can to shore up the
National Theatre's artistic credibility. He bemoans the lack of money and
managerial skills, and says that by playing works like Yevgeny Onegin and
Romeo et Juliette in the original language, the company is losing its
traditional Czech audience. He has agreed to conduct new productions of
Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen and Smetana's The Two Widows - on
condition that they are a true collaboration between conductor and stage
director. 'I will make the choice. If I'm not satisfied, I won't say 'you
have to change it'. I simply won't conduct.'
The Bartered Bride is performed at the Grand Theatre, Geneva, on November 7,
10, 12, 15, 18 and 21.

KENNETH TYNAN LETTERS
edited by Kathleen Tynan
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 22, 690 pages
This collection of letters, unlike Kathleen Tynan's earlier, much admired
and affectionate biography of her late husband, displays some of Kenneth
Tynan's less charming characteristics. The correspondence also reveals
several surprising, and sometimes contradictory, judgments from one of the
most celebrated critics of British theatre.
His early letters from school were innocuous enough, offering only fan
letters and gossip to a friend. Oxford provided the first of several love
affairs; there is fun and variety in this correspondence but only his own
evidence of burgeoning talent. He both directed and played in the theatre;
'my production of Sweeney Agonistes was a terrific success.' Isis called him
'Oxford's best journalist, objectionable Kenneth Tynan.' He came down
without a degree but with several theatrical offers waiting. To Picture Post
he wrote that 'the year which I spent in Oxford was a superb parenthesis in
my life and, like all the best parentheses, they mean more than all the rest
of the sentence.' This was in 1950, when he was 23.
The following Christmas, he sailed with Elaine Dundy, later his first wife,
to New York. John Gielgud asked him to supper and Tynan described Kenneth
More (in The Deep Blue Sea) as 'our best answer to Marlon Brando.'
Arthur Miller's The Crucible, he wrote on a later visit to New York, was 'a
failure dramatically'. Yet 10 years on, in a memo to Olivier, Tynan included
it in a proposed schedule for the National Theatre. In January 1953 he was
working both for the Daily Sketch and the Evening Standard but in July he
wrote to David Astor for a job as second-string theatre critic on the
Observer. This did not stop him from taking on a job as script editor at
Ealing Studios, assuring Astor that 'a not too-tedious job in another field
would stimulate me.'
In September 1958, Wolcott Gibbs of the New Yorker died and William Shawn,
the editor, invited Tynan to take his place. Tynan left Ealing, with a long
critical letter to its director, and began work on the New Yorker.
The section entitled 'Crest of the Wave' begins with the break-up of his
first marriage, which Tynan, on the evidence of these letters, tried to keep
going. The ATV programme, We Dissent, which Tynan had built up with 26
liberal Americans citizens, went out in January 1960 and was ill-received in
US. It is hardly surprising that he reckoned he should be in England again,
where he wrote to Olivier to ask for a job. Olivier, reluctantly at first,
took him on as literary manager for the National Theatre.
'Celebrating the Sixties' is predominantly National Theatre correspondence.
Controversial plays included Robert Graves's re-written Much Ado and Charles
Wood's Dingo, which were turned down by the board. He continued his
freelance work, and the seduction of Kathleen (largely by telegram). In 1956
he proposed an erotic show, 'Nothing that is merely funny or merely
beautiful should be admitted; it must also be sexy.' This became the
notorious Oh] Calcutta.
The 1970s marked the start of Tynan's fade-out period. He was becoming
increasingly radical; work was commissioned from Havel and there was an idea
for pieces about Wilhelm Reich and Daniel Cohn-Bendit.
In a series of letters from Tunisia, his marriage to Kathleen was going well
but his health was breaking down. In London, Peter Hall had taken over from
Olivier at the National and there was talk of Tynan's departure.
By the spring of 1977, he and Kathleen were in California, where he went on
writing pieces about literary and dramatic figures while retaining his
English friendships. He made friends again with his first wife and with
fellow-critic Harold Hobson, and wrote rhymed birthday-cards to his
children. Then he died.
It is hard to sense much affection in these letters - but the answers to
some of his more provocative correspondence would have made interesting
reading.
*****
AS MUCH AS I DARE
by Arnold Wesker
Century Pounds 18.99, 578 pages
If Tynan was the great chronicler of modern British drama, John Osborne, who
reshaped it in the 1950s, was its scalding prophet and Arnold Wesker was a
quieter, questioning counterpart. While Pinter and Becket wowed a complacent
theatre with their oblique absurdism, Osborne and Wesker employed their
supposed working-class realism to equally devastating effect: Osborne raged
and loathed, Wesker argued, doubted and loved.
Unlike Pinter and Beckett, their seminal early plays (Osborne's Look Back in
Anger, Wesker's Chips With Everything and his Trilogy) have dated badly, a
fact both refuse to acknowledge. While Osborne ossifies into damn-you-all
curmudgeonliness, Wesker writes, writes, writes, appealing for justice and
the recognition he gets abroad and feels he deserves at home.
This Arnold Wesker - the wounded, misunderstood artist - cries out
sporadically from the pages of an unruly, unbalanced first volume of
autobiography. He appears in paragraphs announced as 'Asides' in a narrative
that hopscotches back and forth through his life up to 1959 and beyond.
There is also the bereft husband confessing, if not regretting, the adultery
that wrecked his 35-year marriage to the adored Dusty, a marriage barely
begun as this book ends. Most embarrassingly, there is the penitent father,
appealing directly for forgiveness to the eldest son Lindsay Joe who will
not speak to him because of this betrayal. (The publisher notes that, since
writing, Wesker and son are reconciled. Whoopee.)
Mostly though, this is a chronicle of the early years that preceded Wesker's
early success, where he's at pains to assert what most writers spend their
lives denying - the direct autobiographical nature of his plays, poems and
prose. The last hundred-odd pages are gripping as the twentysomething Wesker
is tentatively fostered by the Royal Court, lunched by impresarios and
championed by his revolutionary peers after years of rejection letters. To
reach this consummately readable apotheosis, though, you have to hack
through over 400 pages of reminiscence, romanticism and (Wesker denies it,
but it is there) nostalgia.
The story of his childhood and early adulthood is clotted with diary
extracts (his own and others), letters (ditto), and illustrative snatches
from his works. Wesker could condense, paraphrase or edit, but refuses to.
He depicts himself through younger writings as a mildly embarrassing but
adorable innocent.
His hopes, dreams and, above all, his family and friends are laid
painstakingly and repeatedly before us in an often gauche, sometimes
unctuous and always rambling narrative. Wesker's family - cantankerous but
loving mother, ineffectual father, saintly sister - appear with a frequency
justified by his reliance on them for the grist of his drama. His friends
are another matter. Although many metamorphosed into characters in his
plays, many more seem to be evoked for the sake of avenging past slights or
expunging past guilts in print. A huge number are incidental to the
narrative, suggesting that Wesker is more interested in communing with his
past than communicating with the reader.
Wesker bemoans his infelicity with prose, and it shows. His style at first
is either overwrought and overexcited or fetishistically introspective and
self-absorbed. As if to illustrate the blend of self-doubt and
self-justification that makes up the large part of this volume (the title is
very apt), the pages are littered with question and exclamation marks.
When writing about his early years, Wesker is like a child, alternately
demanding acknowledgment of his cleverness or wheedling for sympathy. Later
 -much later - he settles down to become fast, funny, even fair. He is
brilliantly even-handed to his late friend, the dictatorial director John
Dexter, who premiered Chicken Soup With Barley, Roots and The Kitchen. There
are also thumbnail sketches to rival Osborne's depictions of Tony Richardson
and George Devine, the powerful Royal Court supremos.
For the most part, though, as in his early plays, Wesker now seems to be
overdoing it. His Russian-Transylvanian ancestry; the milieu of an East End
Jewish family through the 1930s, '40s and '50s; the factors that shaped a
young, working-class, autodidact Jewish playwright are all somewhat
smothered by the tangential, the incidental and the inconsequential.
Since this book officially ends in 1959 (Wesker constantly runs ahead of
himself), I presume there's at least one more volume to come. The last fifth
of As Much As l Dare hints at how good the next book might be. The other
four-fifths do not.

THE PRINCE OF WALES: A BIOGRAPHY
by Jonathan Dimbleby
Little, Brown Pounds 20, 640 pages
Just a couple of months before Princess Elizabeth gave birth to her first
son, a report in the New York Times delivered a waspish verdict on post-war
Britain: 'an impoverished second-rate power, morally magnificent but
economically bankrupt'. Today, the feeling that Britain has some kind of
special reserve of probity which can compensate for its otherwise sagging
fortunes is distinctly unfashionable.
Jonathan Dimbleby's sympathetic biography is as much the story of that
decline, of the gradual coarsening of a nation's sensibility, as the tale of
a man who, racked by self-doubt, has come to symbolise Britain's crisis of
identity.
That the two - nation and heir - are symbiotically related has surely been
demonstrated time and time again, not least by the roller-coaster tale of
love, estrangement and high farce which the world has come to know as
Charles-and-Di. The hysterical reception given to their courtship and
wedding smacked of desperation; the price paid for the marriage's failure is
the nation's bitter revenge for being so acutely disillusioned.
It is hard not to warm to Charles from Dimbleby's portrayal; a grown man,
capable of agonising intensity, who still expresses himself in the puerile
vocabulary of the Eagle, the boy's comic given to him by his loving
great-uncle Lord Mountbatten. The future King's moral universe, as expressed
in his diary, refuses to veer beyond the boundaries of 'beastly' and
'jolly'; even after the humiliating tour of Korea and Hong Kong in 1992, by
which time the fairy tale wedding had turned to nightmare, his ire was
cloaked in the terminology of a schoolboy about to have his tuckshop
allowance taken away: 'I feel so unsuited to the ghastly business of human
intrigue and general nastiness . . . I don't know what will happen from now
on, but I dread it.'
The marriage to Diana was something he could - and should - have been talked
out of; but who was there? Certainly not his mother, whose minimal presence
in her son's biography speaks volumes: while Charles prevaricated over
whether to take 'la grande plonge' (sic), we read that 'characteristically
in relation to such matters, the Queen refrained from tendering her
opinion'. Whether she exercised similar restraint when the blushing bride
started head-butting the glass cabinets is not known, but the
widely-publicised lack of intimacy in this very mixed-up family cannot fail
to have blunted the Prince's sense of self-worth.
To his credit, Charles has not allowed the blunderings of his private life
to divert him from the quite complex socio-political positions he has
embraced. In many ways, he would make a perfect monarch for the current age;
his modish mix of eastern philosophies, eco-concern and community politics
certainly strikes more of a chord today than it did at the beginning of the
1980s.
Interestingly, he has one ambition left; after a famous gala White House
dinner in 1985, he reflected: 'Travolta asked Diana to dance, he whisked her
about the floor and everyone left them on their own until I joined in
eventually with a very good American ballerina, whose name I forget. Sadly
there were no lovely actresses or singers. I had been rather hoping that
Diana Ross would be there . . .' Another Diana? Forget it.

THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE
by John D. Barrow
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 150 pages
THE ORIGIN OF HUMANKIND
by Richard Leakey
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 171 pages
THE LAST THREE MINUTES
by Paul Davies
Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99, 162 pages
Popular science books, like crime novels, must get read mainly by people who
follow the genre. In the wake of Stephen Hawking's one great success, there
are so many pop-science books in print that if they were read more widely
the problems of public understanding, which preoccupy scientists and science
ministers alike, would quickly be over.
Here are the first three of a new Anglo-American series, styled Science
Masters, plainly intended to be read by non-habitues. Three Big Questions
are tackled in short, readable books by authors who have all answered them
before. Twenty odd more titles are promised by the turn of the millennium.
So how do the first three fare? Take Barrow and Davies first. Both do a neat
job in the small space prescribed - the putative reader obviously has a
short attention span. John Barrow has a slightly easier time, as he is
merely concerned with the beginning of everything, while Davies has to
address the end but must consider the beginning as well to explain how we
might get there. The big crunch may be implicit in the big bang.
As this implies, both books cover the range of ideas, occasionally
well-attested, often speculative, frequently bizarre, of contemporary
cosmology. Here be black holes, wormholes, baby universes, stardust and dark
matter. These are all explained as clearly as they can be, in simple
English, though some very basic physics is assumed. These stories are about
science as intellectual entertainment, rather than scientific literacy. They
will not do anything for your ability to cope with modern living but they
will ensure that your eschatology is seriously up to date.
The most important property of the universe, of course, is that it harbours
beings who can ponder where it came from. The origin of the local variety of
such beings is Richard Leakey's concern, and his book is the most appealing
of the three. A simpler story, with less way-out concepts, but a compelling
one, well-told. Leakey is especially good on the fact that the evolution of
the genus Homo is both a scientific study and an origin myth. He is well
aware how images of the human past are coloured by prevailing cultural
prejudice, and is clear about the necessary limitations of the historical
sciences. No experiments here: the anthropologist is condemned to
interpreting fragments of a long, complex story, imposing order on scattered
collections of preserved bones which constantly tantalise the scientist who
wants to see the whole picture.
Leakey is candid about holding a minority view on many key questions, like
dating the origin of language - old and slow he reckons, while most of his
colleagues think it was rapid and recent, perhaps as recently as 35,000
years ago. This commitment, to continuity with our forebears rather than a
clean break, makes his arguments seem a little sharper than Barrow or
Davies.
Against the trend of some recent popular science books, he is also honest
about the fact that some of the big questions may remain forever mysterious.
'How can we know what happened to our ancestors' level of consciousness
during the past 2.5 million years?', he asks; 'The harsh reality
anthropologists face is that these questions may be unanswerable'.
Barrow also hints at similar limitations, suggesting that analogies for many
physical theories seem to fall to hand too readily. He suspects that it is
only when there is a theory which can be described in mathematical language,
but which has no obvious meaning outside it, that we are getting close to
physical reality. As he puts it, taking up the crux of Hawking's book, 'One
can read the sentence 'Time becomes another dimension of space', understand
what all the words mean, but still not possess any real understanding of
what is being conveyed'.
Just so. This is another reason why Leakey's book has the edge on reader
satisfaction, and why it may be unwise to launch this series with two books
about the outer reaches of physics. Then again, they might inspire readers
who will go on to fashion new answers to the Big Questions.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Books: Dying falls, abrupt endings - Short Stories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK GALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reading as though written en bloc, the tales in Carol Shields' Various
Miracles (Fourth Estate, Pounds 9.99) are united by a common fascination
with the giddy euphorics of chance. Her wry voice captures moments of
transcendence, accidental beauties mimicking the quirks of human
reminiscence. The image of a wedding ring is swept up with the memory of a
childhood vision, a revelation of religious faith and fresh perception of
married harmony. She shows the process by which scraps of real lives are
transmuted into poetry or anecdotes. A loving testimony to the slow,
unspoken bargains of lasting marriage, Shields' work here is shot through
with honest awe.
Jane Gardam's fiction is made of darker stuff. Going Into a Dark House
(Sinclair Stevenson, Pounds 14.99) is spiced with mortality. She specialises
in abrupt endings where Shields favours the dying fall. Her evocations of
place and mood are vivid, the loving detail she lavishes on land, language
and food, intensely English. Here are tough tales of lost innocence and
shattered hopes. Gardam writes particularly well about the ambivalence of
mother love. Mothers look with disdain on the children they have produced,
daughters regard their parents with cowed, rebellious glowers. There is
humour too, most memorably in Telegony, an historical novella of whale-boned
passion in Edwardian Shipley; blissfully funny at first, then oddly moving.
Salman Rushdie is a word gourmet, piling epithet on epithet, clause on
sickly descriptive clause. In the broader plane of a novel, this pays off
richly; apparently gratuitous word eruptions and extra-narrative excursions
make a vital contribution to a work's vigour. In miniature, however, the
effect can prove clogging. Two tales here, Yorrick and At the Auction of the
Ruby Slippers grind almost to a halt under the weight of Rushdie's
galumphing irony. At its best, however, East, West (Cape, Pounds 9.99) shows
him on extraordinary form. His strongest spells are cast when he curbs his
wilder gestures and dares to gauze over his strong personality with the
deceptively plain tale he is unfurling. The three unpredictable Eastern
fables typify this restraint. Lovely, too, is The Courtier, a fond homage to
Certainly Mary, a redoubtable family ayah. Uprooted and set adrift in
Sixties Kensington, she finds backstairs romance and an unexpected aptitude
for grandmaster chess technique before choosing to return to her roots.
While much of the piece's humour arises from the zany cross-cultural
influences that are the collection's theme, Mary's maintenance of her
dignity in the face of her westernised charges' mockery stands as a decorous
reproof.
The stories in Carol Lake's Switchboard Operators (Bloomsbury, Pounds 12.99)
are so unified in characters and setting that this beguiling book can almost
be read as a novel. Set amid the rarefied procedures, clattering machinery
and sex war skirmishes of the Derby telephone exchange in 1969, the
narratives are as meticulously researched as those in her first work,
Rosehill, so that the book glows with documentary insights. Lake's narrator
is Sylvie, a newcomer to the institution, following in her mother's
footsteps. Less interested in Post Office regulatory procedure than in
following boyfriends to man the Revolution's barricades, Sylvie is a deeply
poignant figure. Less bright than she thinks she is and given to drink, she
is, one gradually perceives, barely a twin-set's reach from a psychiatric
ward. That the undertow of sadness is never allowed to swell up into tragedy
is typical of Lake's cunning.
As much a specialist in the field as VS Pritchett, Alice Munro stands alone
in this batch in writing stories which, for all their brevity, evince such
complex emotional references and depth of character that each reads like a
miraculously compressed novel. For this very reason, it is impossible to
read Open Secrets (Chatto &amp; Windus, Pounds 14.99) back-to-back - one has to
keep laying the book aside to live each tale a little in one's head. Ranging
in their settings from the 1850s to the present, from Canada to the Balkans,
they are united by an undertow of violence and by the restlessness of their
heroines - each a pioneer in her way. Like the best styles, Munro's is
invisible. Inexorable and precise as the slowest cogs in a clock mechanism,
her narratives seem so weighted with imminence and induce an often quite
needless sense of dread.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Sport: Springbok shadows - Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since England's disappointing tour there in May, South African rugby has
hardly been out of the news. Fracas on the field has been matched by verbal
dust-up off it. Recently, Dr Louise Luyt, the SA President said in an
interview that rugby union would be professional by 1995, that Home Union
officials should be fired and that the 1991 World Cup was laughable.
No one within the hermetically sealed committee rooms of the four Home
Unions knows how to read the 'new' South Africa. It was not always thus.
Five years ago, when the political map of that country was more certain or
at least more dependent on the Afrikaner vote, rugby union, unlike nearly
every other sport in the world, helped prop up the political status quo in
South Africa.
There were no boycotts, no ban on players, referees or administrators
visiting the country from the body that pretended it represented the world
view of rugby, the International Rugby Board.
England toured there in 1984; New Zealand tried to tour in 1985 but a
successful court case led by the affable New Zealand rugby player Paddy
Finnigan QC stopped the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in their tracks in
the high court in Wellington. When Judge Casey deliberated at a special
sitting on a Saturday morning in Wellington, the whole of the country was
rooted to the spot. A packed public gallery trailed outside, blocking
traffic. When he found in favour of Finnigan the applause of the gallery
reached out, like a Mexican wave, to the streets and beyond.
New Zealand, whose own rugby union had toured South Africa without Maoris to
accommodate the apartheid policies of the South Africans, was posting notice
that it was growing up. Within months, the British Lions due to tour South
Africa in 1985, fearful also of a legal challenge, called off the tour. Only
the French, as ever, decided to break ranks, touring in 1990.
But there were two other tours. The first was the Andy-Haden-inspired
renegade tour of South Africa by a New Zealand Cavaliers side, and the
second was a group of international players who played in the white South
African rugby board's centenary matches in 1989.
Haden denies there was any incentive other than pride for the team he
secretly assembled. But the 1989 tour was altogether different. Such was the
subterfuge, allegation and rumour within the Welsh Rugby Union of the
amounts of money given to players and administrators who attended those
celebrations that a report was commissioned.
That report, of which there are three versions - one of over 2,000 pages,
one of about a 1,000 pages, and a shorter report of only 13 pages. I have a
copy of the shorter version. It states:
' . . . Had we been deciding this issue (payment) on the balance of
probabilities that, from the evidence heard, we would have found that most
(and quite possibly all) of the players were handsomely rewarded for going
to South Africa. By that we mean that they received money, and not just the
incidental benefits. At least one player received at least Pounds 30,000 and
others as much or broadly comparable figures . . .'
The report carefully lays the blame on the players but I am sure that the
administrators who attended were also well rewarded.
Who paid? Why, the South African Rugby Board under that wily old fox Danie
Craven.
The irony is that this report was carried out by Vernon Pugh QC, then an
innocent by-stander in Welsh rugby affairs. Three years later he is both
chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union and the International Rugby Football
Board. Two weeks ago, Luyt failed to appear at the interim IRFB board
meeting in Vancouver, where he was to be asked to explain his remarks on the
four Home Unions.
I would guess, therefore, that if you were Pugh, almost the last country you
would want to confront on and off the field currently would be South Africa.
Yet South Africa are in Wales and carrying all before them.
Once the sporting isolation was imposed, club rugby in South Africa
gradually became a bit-part player to the provinces. The provinces owned the
grounds and had the television and sponsorship. And with no one to play, the
country had little choice but to turn its provincial championship into a
mini-international series.
The gates were huge, frequently topping 40,000, often reaching the 65,000
capacity of the larger grounds. Consequently the amount of money piling up
was unreal in an unreal country. That money meant that South African rugby
union could stop its players following the country's cricketers to Australia
and England.
To keep them, deals were done. These started with inflated expenses and
turned almost into payments and then salaries. Luyt knows the score. What
irritates him is that he believes this is the direction all top-level rugby
union must go. He cannot fathom why the four Home Unions are hiding the
truth. He knows how much some of them were paid to come to South Africa in
1989.
Meanwhile, the side South Africa has brought to Wales and Scotland is good
verging on excellent. It is hard to see any real weaknesses except that the
team has not yet gelled completely and sometimes coasts when it is ahead.
There are some great players - Japie Mulder and Brendan Venter in the centre
and Mark Andrews and Dirkus Hatingh in the second row - but, as always,
South Africa takes time to settle when overseas. Just the public scrutiny is
hard for them to take coming, as they do, from a society that hid the truth
for so long.
They were last in the UK only two years ago when the last team of the Naas
Botha era played against England. Botha briefly played American football for
the Dallas Cowboys and yet was re-admitted to the amateur game immediately
his contract ended. On the field, Botha led South African rugby down too
many blind alleys because he saw the game only in yardage; making huge kicks
to take his forwards over the gain line.
Two years on, this side is fitter, faster, heavier up-front and stronger in
every position. Its only problem, apart from a still over-vigorous approach,
is that it cannot decide on a half-back partnership. Nonetheless, the
Springboks are preparing to be crowned world champions next year at Ellis
Park, Johannesburg.

Cars are getting so much smarter than the people who use them that they will
soon be equipped with electronic systems taking decisions out of the
driver's hands.
It all began some years ago with ABS (or anti-lock) brakes that allow
drivers to stamp on the pedal and then steer round obstacles without losing
control - whereas panic braking on wet roads in cars without ABS often
causes accidents.
The reason is that a car slows down much better when the tyres are just
revolving than when they are sliding. And as sliding tyres have no sideways
grip, the front ones cannot steer the car and the back ones cannot prevent
the tail from swinging out of line.
But ABS works properly only if you slam on the brakes as hard as you can and
keep trying to push the pedal through the floor until the car stops.
Research by Lucas and Mercedes-Benz has shown that seven out of 10 drivers
of ABS-equipped cars get it wrong.
In an emergency, they slam on the brakes quickly enough but then ease off
slightly. This means the full benefit of the servo mechanism, which boosts
braking power, is lost. Stopping the car takes longer than it need.
So, Lucas and Mercedes-Benz have evolved an electronically controlled brake
booster that senses emergency braking. It then keeps the brake-boosting
servo fully on even if the driver is no longer pressing the pedal as hard as
possible. The system will start to appear on Mercedes-Benz cars from the
1996 model year.
Ken Maciver, managing director of Lucas Braking Systems, describes the
electronic actuation system (EAS) as the biggest advance in braking since
ABS was introduced more than 20 years ago. EAS not only allows ABS brakes to
work with full efficiency - it also prevents a leaden-footed driver from
spinning the drive wheels during acceleration, and even helps prevent a car
from drifting off line in a bend taken too fast.
There has been a lot of emphasis recently on passive safety: on things such
as air bags, crumple zones and side intrusion bars to protect occupants when
a car crashes. All of this is well and good - but it must be better not to
have a crash in the first place. This is where active safety systems such as
EAS come in.
Also under development by Mercedes-Benz, although some way off production,
is an intelligent cruise control system. If fitted to cars as routinely as
heater / demisters and stereos now are, it would get rid of those motorway
menaces, the tail-gaters. They are a prime cause of multiple crashes because
they follow so closely that, when the traffic slows suddenly, they cannot
help running into the car in front.
The Mercedes-Benz system uses infra-red transmitters integrated into a
headlamp to monitor the traffic in front. A computer calculates the safe
headway for the car and maintains it by operating the accelerator and brake.
It is, of course, only a thought - but if drivers were half as intelligent
as the Mercedes-Benz cruise control, they would always keep a proper
distance from the car in front and reduce speed on slippery roads. Then,
none of these clever electronic devices would be necessary.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Sport: On the right course? - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Three years to go and already Valderrama's suitability as a Ryder Cup venue
is being questioned. Last week's Volvo Masters at the Spanish venue produced
record crowds but they in turn heightened alarm that the course will be
unable to cope when much larger numbers attend in 1997. The fundamental
question is whether such events as the Ryder Cup should be held on
traditional or modern courses.
Valderrama was built only in 1975 but is firmly traditional in design.
Anyone who attended the last three Ryder Cups in Europe at the Belfry, for
example, will certainly enjoy the better aesthetics. Almost every hole is
marked by the vivid shapes and luminous bark of cork trees.
The course swoops both uphill and down and offers splendid views of the
Andalucian countryside. Its owner, a retired tin billionaire from Bolivia,
Jaime Ortiz Patino, is thought to spend Pounds 4m of his own money each year
to maintain the course in splendid condition.
In the six years since he bought it outright, Patino has ironed out some of
the quirks that brought a mixed reaction from the professionals when
Valderrama was first added to the tournament schedule.
'It looks like it was designed by Walt Disney's brother,' David Feherty once
said.
Patino has rebuilt the greens at the rate of two a year so that they spike
up less and drain more quickly. The 17th has been converted from a long and
arduous par five to one that resembles the 15th at Augusta. The bank behind
the green will make a splendid focal point.
There are many feature holes. The fourth is a spectacular par five; the
eighth a gorgeous short par four; the 10th another birdie opportunity; the
12th an enormously long short hole cut through an avenue of woodland; the
15th is a scenic par three. Few who have either seen or played Valderrama
doubt its right to be considered among the top 10 courses in Europe.
But does that make it a great Ryder Cup venue? The trouble with traditional
courses is that they were never meant to accommodate heavy traffic. Who
could have foreseen, in a country where few people are interested in golf,
that one day Valderrama would have 25,000 spectators walking around it?
There are bottlenecks everywhere that will make it a logistical nightmare
for those who like to follow the Ryder Cup matches around the course. To get
from the second to the third involves going through a small tunnel. To get
from the 14th to the 15th means clambering up a steep bank, and people were
slipping and falling as they endeavoured to follow Severiano Ballesteros on
the final day last week. Walk along the left of the 17th and it is not
possible to see a thing until the green is in sight.
The trees which add so much to the course's splendour heavily restrict the
numbers who can walk around. The 18th, the most crucial hole of all, is one
of the worst in this respect. Few people will be able to see anything.
Patino has his answers to some of these questions. There is talk of a bridge
being built between the second and the third. He is discussing with an
electronics company the possibility of constructing a giant television
screen behind the 17th so that people will not have to fight to catch a
glimpse of a match that goes down the last. On the 18th, eight of his
beloved cork trees are to be removed to accommodate a grandstand.
Some of the problems, though, seemed to have escaped his notice until they
were pointed out. He was unaware that viewing was impossible from the side
of the 17th fairway.
To these concerns Patino added one of his own. A section of the road that
links Malaga to Valderrama has still to be built and so for 11 miles the
traffic is down to one lane in either direction. Patino, in his Ryder Cup
bid, said this would be a dual carriageway by the time of the match itself
and there would be no problems.
He was wrong. The construction work is in grave doubt. The Spanish
government wants it to be a toll road and is awaiting bids to build it. None
are forthcoming. If the money to build is not in the transport budget by
next March then Patino doubts that it will be constructed in time. In that
case, he estimates, spectators could take six hours to travel the 30 miles
from Marbella to the course.
Patino is clearly adopting a high risk strategy in making known his dismay.
He hopes to shame the government into action. But his views merely reinforce
the long-held thoughts of many in Britain, that the Ryder Cup will be
damaged by Spanish inefficiency.
Would not the Ryder Cup be better on a modern course, which may be bland,
but will be easy for spectators and accessible? It is a question that
Valderrama, the sum of our hopes and fears, raises.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hatchbacks with load spaces are useful but many feel saloon cars with boots
have more style. Yet, Peugeot calls its latest 306 four-door a sedan. I
thought low gearing made the poshest two-litre ST model I drove sound fussy
at motorway cruising speeds. It was nippy in town, rode with Peugeot's usual
shock absorbency, and had exceptional space inside. Prices are from Pounds
11,565 to Pounds 13,850.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Sport: The Big Dog takes his bite - Basketball / Patrick
Harverson looks ahead to a US basketball season purged of violence but not
free of greed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this year of sports folly, it was difficult to imagine that anyone could
surpass the greed displayed by the owners and players whose squabbles over
money have shut down two of North America's four major league professional
sports, baseball and ice hockey.
Then along came Glenn 'Big Dog' Robinson.
Robinson, 21 years old, and 6ft 7ins, was an outstanding basketball player
at Purdue University in Indiana. He should have been making his professional
debut last night when his team, the Milwaukee Bucks, played its first game
of the 1994-5 season against the Philadelphia 76ers.
But Robinson could not have been expected to make much impact last night.
This is because he had only one day's practice with his new team, having
spent all but the final day of the pre-season engaged in a contract dispute
with the Bucks, who earned the right to choose him by virtue of being one of
the league's worst teams last year.
The dispute was over Milwaukee's refusal to accept Robinson's demand for a
Dollars 100m, 13-year contract. At Dollars 7.7m a year, the untested
Robinson was asking for more than double what the recently-retired Michael
Jordan, arguably the greatest player in the game's history, was worth just
two seasons ago.
Even in North America, where salaries in sport reached stratospheric levels
years ago, Robinson's demand was greeted with astonishment. An established
player who had led his team to a championship or two might be regarded as
avaricious if he asked for that much, but a newcomer who had yet to score a
single point in his professional career?
Robinson's hard-bargaining tactics were particularly distasteful because he
was seeking a king's ransom from one of the poorest clubs in the NBA.
Milwaukee is a small market by US sport's standards, and its team has
enjoyed little success lately, so the club cannot count on earning the vast
sums of money from television rights or merchandising sales commanded by the
big-city teams such as the New York Knicks or Chicago Bulls. Herb Kohl, the
Bucks' owner put it all in perspective when he said last week that he was
considering trading his ownership of the franchise in return for Robinson's
salary.
In the end, however, Milwaukee could not face the prospect of starting the
season without their marquee player, and on Wednesday the club signed
Robinson to a contract that will pay him Dollars 68m over 10 years. At about
Dollars 83,000 a game, that makes Robinson one of the highest paid players
in professional team sports.
The Robinson saga illustrates a flaw in the NBA's draft system. As in other
North American sports, the process by which the best college players are fed
into the professional game is designed to promote parity within the league
by giving the worst teams each year the first pick of the college stars.
In recent years there has been a dramatic inflation in first-year, or
'rookie', pay levels. In each of the past few seasons, the top selection of
the draft has invariably demanded - and received - more money than the
previous year's top selection. Consequently, the worst teams get the best
young players, but they are also saddled with the best young players'
increasingly immense salaries. And the worst teams (Milwaukee, the Dallas
Mavericks, or the Sacramento Kings) are often the poorest, by virtue of
their lack of success.
To improve, the bad clubs need to hire a star rookie, but to keep him they
have to cut the pay of their other players, or let some of their veterans
go, which only impedes the team's improvement.
It is not just the size of the salaries demanded that poses a problem, but
also the length of the contracts. Robinson has achieved guaranteed financial
security over the next 10 years - the length of an entire career in the NBA.
Yet, not only can the Bucks not know if Robinson will ever become the
superstar player the club badly needs, they also cannot possibly know how
long he will last in a league which places an increasingly demanding
physical burden on its top performers. Signing a young player like Robinson
to a 10-year contract is like buying a long-term mortgage on a house in the
middle of war zone.
Of course, the club did not have to pay the vast sums demanded by Robinson,
but the Bucks could not afford to have its star rookie sit out the season,
as happened in Dallas three years ago when the talented Jimmy Jackson
declined the salary offered by the Mavericks. Jackson missed an entire
season, and although he signed for the club a year later and was joined by
Jamal Mashburn, another top college player, neither Jackson nor the team has
since recovered from the disruption. In the last two years, the Mavericks
have finished 27th in the 27-team NBA.
Robinson's decision to sign was good news for the NBA. The league cannot
afford to do without players of his pulse-quickening skills and athleticism.
Last season was one of the dullest in recent memory, and the championship
was won by one defence-oriented team (the Houston Rockets) over another
defence-oriented team (the New York Knicks). In an attempt to restore the
game's lustre, the NBA has introduced new rules against dirty play and
intimidatory tactics that are designed to rid basketball of its more brutish
habits.
Although it is theoretically a non-contact sport, basketball has always
tolerated its share of bumps and bruises, crashes and collisions. In recent
years, however, some teams have been pushing the rules as far as they will
go, with players using their hands, elbows, shoulders, and hips to break up
attacks and disturb the flow of the game. This style of play has turned up
the temperature on court, leading all too often to the violent eruptions
that have earned the sport the nickname 'basketbrawl'.
Yet, as Fifa, world soccer's governing body, has discovered this year with
the introduction of its new rules against dirty play, the NBA is learning
that cracking down on rough and defensive tactics can mean cleaner, but not
necessarily better, games.
The chaos and confusion among players and referees over how to handle the
new rules made for some disjointed contests during pre-season exhibition
basketball last month. The always image-conscious NBA can only hope that
players will quickly adapt to the new rules, and that the new season will
not see too many repeats of the tedious free-throw shooting contests that
the fans have had to endure in pre-season games over the past few weeks.

FT  05 NOV 94 / Food and Drink: A taste of two cities - Giles MacDonogh goes
in search of the classic cafe in Vienna and Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You will still find the classic cafe of the German-speaking world in Vienna.
It survived world and cold wars as an extended living room where you waste
time; keep out of the cold; talk; read newspapers and drinks all sorts of
different sorts of coffee.
Some drink beer or schnapps. Wine you approach with caution. It is best
adulterated with fizzy water as a gespritzter. Without the water the wine
can be pretty poisonous.
You occasionally see people eating in a cafe. It is nothing special: a
Schnitzel (vom Schwein), a potato salad and a sticky cake to follow. If you
want good wine or refined food, you go to a restaurant.
Some of Vienna's cafes have preserved that out-at-the-elbow feel about them.
For many, the best is Hawelka in the Dorotheengasse, with its rickety chairs
and crumbly waiters. The Eiles in the Josefstadt is refreshingly dowdy. The
seediest is the Alt-Wien, which houses a peculiar collection of gnarled old
chunks of humanity until the early hours of the morning.
The cafes which have been dolled up have lost their charm. This happened to
the Landtmann opposite the Parliament. The Schwarzenberg on the
Schwarzenberg Platz now looks like a 1960s milk bar, even if there are good
cakes and excellent Gluhwein in winter. In the Imperial Hotel is the chichi
Cafe Imperial where people break the rules by eating delicate dishes of
un-cafe like food.
In Berlin, the Third Reich drove out cafe life - along with the artists and
intellectuals. Their haunt used to be the Romanische Cafe by the Kaiser
Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche. The church's ruin is a poignant symbol of post-war
Berlin with its uncomfortable blend of pompous old and badly dated modern.
Alas, the old 'Romanischen' was destroyed in the war. Its site is occupied
by the beastly Europe Centre.
Bombs also smote the old Cafe des Westens where George Grosz went to shock
the bourgeoisie. The name alone is preserved on a building which looks like
a lot of suitcases laid on their sides.
I have never had the courage to climb the stairs. Long before the Nazis
ruined Berlin the Cafe des Westens had transmogrified into the Cafe Kranzler
in the Kurfurstendamm. Kranzler was rebuilt in the 1950s. It is not nice:
the coffee is vile; the waitresses grumpy and the place is filled with
bewildered provincials.
Also on the Kurfurstendamm are two branches of Cafe Mohring in surviving
Wilhelmine buildings. The cakes are said to be good, but I have never had
any luck with the coffee; and neither Mohring has a gram of atmosphere.
Game, set and match to Vienna.
On the other hand a new style of cafe-life has sprung up in Berlin. Arty
cafes have become the alternative to the rough-and-tumble Kneipe, where
people go to get drunk.
I was alerted to the Cafe Hegel in the Savigny Platz by Berlin's best daily,
Der Tagespiegel. A home-sick Austrian said the only thing he would miss in
Berlin was the Cafe Hegel. This I had to see. It certainly had the tattiness
of a Viennese cafe; a proper Stammlokal which looked after its regulars.
Signs and posters in Russian pointed to the possibility of Russian artists
forming a part of its clientele, but there were none there that night. A
solitary man came and sat at the bar; issued impossible instructions to the
waitress on how to pour a wheat beer; noisily rearranged the furniture; then
proceeded to carry on a vigorous conversation with himself. I left in
despair.
Intentionally much more like Vienna is the Cafe Einstein in the
Kurfurstenstrasse. It is in one of the Tiergarten's few surviving villas.
Unlike its Viennese counterpart, however, customers drink decent wine and
eat refined, new wave, Austrian food. Like many Berlin cafes, Einstein
functions chiefly as a restaurant.
Similar in style is the Cafe im Literaturhaus in the Fasanenstrasse. Which
serves good wines and decent food. A special feature is the readings which
take place in an old, panelled room on Monday nights. I went to one on Greek
love given by a man who was clearly partisan.
He spoke for an hour and a half about Spartan gymnopaedes, Zeus and Ganymede
and Socrates and Alcibiades. He illustrated the talk with lurid pictures,
occasionally taking a big slurp from a heroic bumper of wine.
I gave up trying to find a cafe with Viennese style. I went instead to the
most historic wine house in Berlin: Lutter und Wegner in the
Schluterstrasse. It used to be in the east, but after the war it moved to
smart Charlottenburg and this small room with its dark wainscotting and
nicotine yellow paint work. It is a restaurant now. In the early 19th
century it was a tavern; the Stammlokal of ETA Hoffmann (of the Tales) and
his friend, the actor Ludwig Devrient.
Here they swallowed oceans of champagne. Lutter once tried to present
Hoffmann with a bill. He and Devrient were incensed and stormed off to
Schonert in the nearby Mohrenstrasse. Lutter realised his mistake: Hoffmann
and Devrient had created his fame. He rushed round to Schonert and tore up
the bill before their eyes. When Hoffmann died (to some extent from drink)
in 1822, Lutter wiped the slate clean a second time. Devrient died 10 years
later, his gaze fixed on a portrait of his dead friend.
This Lutter und Wegner serves good, modern food: a 'carpaccio of courgettes'
with plenty of parmesan came with a bloody piece of lamb fillet (it was
better than it sounds); but the duck on a roquefort sauce was salty (they
had bought the wrong roquefort). Here I had to drink a glass of champagne
for Hoffmann and Devrient: probably the first men to bring style to the old
Prussian capital.
