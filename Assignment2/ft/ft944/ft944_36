The African National Congress has been forced into several policy reversals
since becoming the leading partner in South Africa's government of national
unity, but few of its conversions have been more dramatic than its recent
decision to embrace privatisation as a means of generating funds for social
development.
Only a month after the country's April election, President Nelson Mandela
was vowing he would never support a programme that would merely channel more
wealth into the hands of the country's white minority. As recently as
August, Mr Jay Naidoo, minister in charge of implementing the government's
centrepiece reconstruction and development programme, condemned
privatisation as a method of 'sacrificing long-term assets for a short-term
benefit'.
By October, however, in a white paper on the RDP, the government had warmed
to the idea of selling 'unproductive state assets' to raise funds for the
programme, and last weekend Mr Thabo Mbeki, deputy president, for the first
time endorsed privatisation as an integral part of government policy.
So far, little attention has been paid to exactly what the government is
likely to sell off, what the means of privatisation might be, and just how
much revenue is likely to be raised. State assets amount to several hundred
billion rands, but likely proceeds from privatisation will only be a small
fraction of that.
Of the state companies that could be sold off, the net value of those under
the authority of the ministry of public enterprises - including electricity
utility Eskom, transport conglomerate Transnet, and arms and technology
manufacturer Denel - were recently assessed at about R30bn (Pounds 5.3bn) by
the government.
Adding the state-run telecommunications company Telkom, vast tracts of
state-owned land and forest, the post office, public broadcaster SABC and
concerns such as the Industrial Development Corporation and state abattoir
Abacor, the total realisable assets are probably closer to R50bn.
Practical obstacles to readying state companies for privatisation are
smaller than expected. The National party government of the late 1980s was
also strongly in favour of privatisation; it sold off two companies  -
Iscor, the country's largest iron and steel concern, and National Sorghum
Breweries, the state brewer of maize-based beers for the black community -
before stopping the process in 1991 under pressure from the ANC.
Both companies are now regarded as successes. Although Iscor went through a
rocky few years shortly after its launch in 1989, it is today the most
widely traded share on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and has recently
reported excellent results. NSB, meanwhile, which was sold privately to a
consortium of black businessmen comprising largely the company's employees
and distributors, became the first high-profile, black-owned business in the
country.
But while it stopped its privatisation programme, the previous government
placed nearly all other public companies, such as Telkom, Denel, and
Transnet on a commercial footing, making them fully accountable and under
the control of appointed boards of directors.
'Unlike most of eastern Europe, where many state companies suffered from
poor management and it was almost impossible to assess their assets, this is
not a problem here,' observes Mr Mark Katzenellenbogen, of merchant bankers
S G Warburg.
Just as attractive for the government as raising money is the possibility of
increasing the general stock of black wealth in the country by ensuring that
some of the benefits of privatisation accrue to the black community. The
government is almost certain to utilise a variant of the voucher schemes
employed in eastern Europe or parts of Latin America, whereby citizens are
allocated shares in privatised companies which they can either hold as
investments or use as collateral.
But although the markets may be hoping that privatisation will begin with a
bang, preferably by putting a big corporation on the block and using the
share offering to raise South Africa's profile in international markets,
many in the ANC are still concerned that this would jeopardise the RDP's
aims of developing poorer areas.
As a result, the early offerings will probably be relatively small and are
unlikely to garner significant international interest. The first sizeable
operations to be sold off will probably be Denel and the domestic operations
of South African Airways, now part of Transnet. Neither are seen as
politically critical to the RDP and both already operate on a sound
commercial footing.
But even if giants like Eskom and Telkom do not come on the market
immediately, most analysts are convinced it is just a question of when, not
if, the ANC-led administration will give ground. As one observer says: 'The
simple fact is the government needs the money.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Beijing assails provinces' rush for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's provinces were accused yesterday of engaging in the 'blind pursuit'
of higher growth at the expense of the fight against inflation, in a tough
official commentary that appeared to foreshadow renewed pressure to curb
spending.
The official Xinhua news agency, in a dispatch that almost certainly
reflects the views of senior leadership, charged that lack of spending
restraint at local levels had 'exerted a negative impact on the central
government's efforts to control inflation'.
The strong wording suggests Beijing is losing patience with provinces
continuing wilfully to ignore central government directives. It also
indicates increasing concern in Beijing at the difficulty of combating
inflation.
The Xinhua dispatch reported some 9,000 new construction projects were begun
in China in July and August, in defiance of attempts to slow the rate of
growth in fixed-asset spending. 'The reason for the price rises since the
beginning of this year is basically a result of expansion in construction
investment and excessive consumption,' the commentary said.
China's consumer prices rose 27.4 per cent in the 12 months to September.
This was almost two percentage points up on August, and indicated that,
despite a stiffening of price controls, the underlying inflation rate
remained stubbornly high.
China reported that, in the nine months to September, 'fixed asset' spending
grew 43.9 per cent above the same period last year. This represented a
slowing of such investment, but the authorities are clearly concerned that
capital spending remains too high.
The People's Bank, China's central bank, released figures this week which
showed that the broader M2 measure of money supply grew 37.1 per cent
year-on-year in the third quarter, compared with the annual target for this
year of 24 per cent.
People's Bank officials warned that stronger effort was required to combat
inflation. They blamed lack of budgetary restraint, persistent demands by
state enterprises for working capital, and excessive growth in wages and
salaries, for current problems.
Earlier this week, the State Council, or cabinet, cracked down on non-bank
financial institutions in an effort to curb unauthorised lending outside the
credit plan. Local co-operatives and trust and investment companies have
been an alternative source of funding for construction projects in defiance
of government efforts to rein in such spending.
China last year introduced a 16-point stabilisation programme aimed at
calming an overheating economy. While the measures have had some effect, the
continuing high rates of inflation have obliged the authorities to take
stronger remedial measures, including the reintroduction of price controls.
The government announced in August that it was making the inflation fight
its main priority for the rest of the year.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Singapore ministers to get big pay rises
</HEADLINE>

   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore's parliament agreed yesterday that ministers and civil servants,
already among the world's highest paid, will get hefty pay rises to make
their salaries more competitive with the private sector, Reuter reports from
Singapore.
Parliament backed government proposals by 61-6 for salary rises starting in
mid-1995 aimed at keeping and attracting the island state's top talent. The
government was setting out to change the perception of a job in civil
administration to one of the top earning professions, Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong told parliament.
But Mr Goh, who earns nearly SDollars 96,000 (Pounds 40,00) a month, said he
would exempt his own salary from the pay rise, giving him 'the moral
authority to make a case for the civil service and future ministers'. His
pay would be reviewed by an independent panel.
Under the changes, a minister's pay will be set at two-thirds the average
earnings of the four highest earners in six top-paying private professions.
Senior civil servants' pay will also be based on earnings in the six
professions.
At present ministers earn SDollars 48,900 a month while the average salary
of a senior civil servant is SDollars 13,000 a month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's central bank, custodian of one of the world's biggest hoards of
foreign exchange reserves at Dollars 91bn (Pounds 56bn), has launched a
crackdown on 'speculation' in the local currency to prevent further
appreciation which could hurt exporters.
The Central Bank of China yesterday cleared three foreign banks of illegally
speculating on the Taiwan dollar after investigating their transactions
during Wednesday's volatile trading session.
'After looking into it, we found no wrongdoing,' said Mr Chang Pao-hsi, head
of the central bank's foreign exchange department. 'We found they did have a
genuine need' to buy US dollars on the forward market.
The central bank imposes strict limits on banks' overbought and oversold
positions in the spot and forward foreign exchange market, to limit their
ability to take positions. Dealing activities involving the local currency
are intended only for trade-related purposes.
Suspecting violations of foreign exchange trading regulations, the central
bank sent inspectors to the Taipei branches of ABN-AMRO Bank, American
Express Bank and Chemical Bank after the close of trade on Wednesday to
check their books. The banks were subsequently cleared.
The investigation received banner headlines yesterday in the
mass-circulation China Times newspaper and financial dailies in what
observers said was a clear signal to foreign banks to stop taking positions
in the local currency.
A foreign banker said the moves were consistent with a central bank proposal
earlier this week to develop Taipei into a regional financial centre
modelled after Singapore, which discourages speculation in the Singapore
dollar.
But he added: 'It would be fair to say that what some people call
speculation, others would call trading.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / HK airport signing is short of a real deal: UK-China
tensions still bedevil agreement on funding the project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from Britain and China meet today to sign an agreement on the
funding of Hong Kong's HKDollars 158bn (Pounds 12.6bn) airport project.
While it is an important symbolic occasion demonstrating that the two sides
are committed to resolving their differences on the matter, a vital element
will be missing.
Without so-called 'financial support agreements' necessary for borrowing,
today's agreement amounts to little more than a refinement of the
'memorandum of understanding' that Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister,
flew to Beijing to sign in September 1991. And that committed the Chinese
government to taking just one month to approve the financial details of the
airport project.
The six-point agreement to be signed today will cap permissible public debt
at HKDollars 23bn and provide for a HKDollars 60bn equity injection into the
two public corporations responsible for the airport and its connecting
railway.
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) will receive an equity injection
of HKDollars 23.7bn and be allowed to borrow up to HKDollars 11.4bn, while
the Airport Authority (AA) will receive an equity infusion of HKDollars
36.6bn and be allowed to borrow HKDollars 11.6bn.
To satisfy China's aversion to debt finance, the Hong Kong government has
committed itself to paying in more equity rather than increasing borrowings
in the event of cost overruns.
The 'financial support agreements' missing from today's signing are the
documents the MTRC and the AA need before they can approach financial
markets for borrowings.
Chinese officials have told their UK counterparts that they will deal
expeditiously with these agreements. They have indicated that the MTRC's
support agreement can be dealt with first while the AA's will have to await
its formal incorporation after legislation has been passed later this year.
Since March 1992, when the Hong Kong government put forward its first
financial plan, it has often been hard to believe that the central point at
issue was the funding of an airport and its railway. The ensuing talks
became entangled in the long-running Anglo-Chinese dispute about democracy,
overlaid by concerns that the airport was a British ploy to strip Hong Kong
of its riches, and was possibly not even necessary.
Only after the political dispute was played to a stalemate in June this year
did the issue of airport finance become resolvable. The airport talks have,
therefore, been a metaphor for Anglo-Chinese relations.
In the end, as always, China's will has prevailed. It never liked the idea
of funding the project with debt, in spite of the fact that 1992 and 1993
were the two best years in a generation in which to borrow long term. So the
proposed HKDollars 73bn of debt was reduced to HKDollars 23bn.
It always sought, and won, the advantage in negotiation. When, during the
summer, the UK sought to get agreement for both the minute and the support
agreements China balked. It wanted the minute first, then talks about the
support agreements; that is what it got.
When Governor Chris Patten ill-advisedly said in London last week that an
airport agreement was only 'days' away, Beijing made sure that he was made
to wait more than a week.
To add insult to injury, in Beijing on Wednesday night Mr Lu Ping, China's
top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, sought to play down the
significance of the airport deal for China's broader relationship with
Britain over Hong Kong.
'It does not solve everything,' he said. 'It does not mean that everything
about the transition of Hong Kong is smooth sailing.'
Indeed not. At the same time as officials were inching their way toward the
deal to be signed today there were signs of other rows on the horizon. The
Hong Kong government's award to Gammon, a Jardine group company, of a
HKDollars 790m contract to build a naval base for the Chinese navy has been
loudly condemned by Beijing. Gammon submitted the lowest tender of the seven
companies that competed for the contract, but Beijing has been angered by
Jardine's delisting from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which has been seen
as a vote of no confidence in China's future administration of the
territory.
The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday that Beijing expected
to be consulted and informed of the outcome of tenders.
There are modestly encouraging signs that a way ahead is emerging. Last week
a senior official from Hong Kong's Monetary Authority attended a 'seminar'
in the colony organised by Beijing's 1997 advisers. He gave the government's
view on why Hong Kong's exchange rate peg to the dollar should be preserved
 -a view that was quickly agreed to by Beijing.
Such artificial occasions may not be an ideal way for Hong Kong to discuss
issues of importance with its future landlord, but in the absence of a
breakthrough in Sino-British ties, which no one expects, they are about the
best Hong Kong can muster these days.

<TEXT>
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority is 'unlikely' to grant permission for a
weekly flight between Uruguay and the disputed Falkland Islands because of
concern over safety standards, according to Mr Roger James, deputy head of
mission at the British embassy in Montevideo.
Air Atlantic Uruguay ran its inaugural four-hour flight, in a converted
Hercules 130 leased from the Uruguayan air force, in September, but has
since been refused permission to fly. 'The problem is the use of a military
plane for a civilian flight,' said Mr James. 'At the moment things are stuck
but we are trying to resolve the issue.'
In principle, the British are keen to see more flights to the Falklands,
which since the British-Argentine conflict of 1982 have been practically cut
off from the Latin American mainland. The Air Atlantic flight, whose maiden
trip brought fresh fruit and other rarities to the isolated South Atlantic
islands, was the first of its kind since the war.

Strong sales in the northeast and south helped boost US sales of new
single-family houses 2.6 per cent in September to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 703,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday. September's
increase followed a revised 7.9 per cent rise in August to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 685,000. The August rise previously was reported as
9.7 per cent.
New home sales have now risen for three straight months. Economists said the
higher level of new home sales demonstrated the economy's vigour despite the
Federal Reserve's five rounds of credit tightening so far this year. The
economy 'continues to perform above the pace which the Federal Reserve has
indicated it is desirous to slow it to,' said Mr Allan Leslie, chief
economist at Discount Corp of New York.

<TEXT>
Christie's held one of its most successful auctions of contemporary art ever
in New York on Wednesday night, raising Dollars 14.56m (Pounds 8.8m) and
with 44 of the 50 lots finding buyers. In terms of value the auction was 96
per cent sold. Given the nervous state of the market in the last four years
this was a great achievement, suggesting that Christie's had been shrewd in
its choice of works to sell and in its reserves and estimates.
The top price was the Dollars 3.63m paid for an Andy Warhol silkscreen
portrait of Marilyn Monroe, 'Shot Red Marilyn', which had a Dollars 3m top
estimate. The work, considered the best of Warhol's many Marilyn portraits,
gained its title after a would-be assassin shot the picture rather than the
artist. In May 1989, at the top of the market, it had sold for Dollars 4.07m
to the Japanese collector Masao Wanibuchi.
There were new auction records for four artists, including Donald Judd,
Sigmar Polke, Francesco Clemente, and the notorious Jeff Koons - Dollars
233,500 for a stainless steel bust of Louis XIV. Other high prices in an
auction dominated by American collectors were the Dollars 596,500 for
'Untitled' by Anselm Kiefer, which was bought by the North Carolina Museum
of Art; Dollars 574,500 for 'Canopic Head, 1951', a steel sculpture by David
Smith, the leading abstract expressionist sculptor of the 1950s; and Dollars
530,500 for another large steel sculpture by Smith, 'Primo Piano I'.

anti-immigrant plan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition to California's Proposition 187, denying social services to
illegal immigrants, appears to be gathering momentum. Two new television
polls in the past 24 hours still left the initiative ahead, by 49-42 and
48-38 per cent respectively, but for the first time, it commanded less than
majority support and its edge was a far cry from the two-to-one margin
recorded a month ago.
Hispanic-American voters, in particular, have swung heavily against. A
survey released this week by the Southwest Voter Research Institute found 57
per cent opposed to the proposition, which is on the state ballot in next
Tuesday's mid-term poll, and only 15 per cent in favour, with the balance
undecided. In mid-October, polls showed nearly half the legal Hispanic
residents in support.
Opposition has also been fanned by the Mexican government. The foreign
ministry in September complained of the 'xenophobia and racism' implicit in
the proposal. Now Mexico is offering assistance and advice on fighting it to
Hispanic groups in California, a break with its practice of not interfering
in US politics.
Three Sundays ago, about 70,000 paraded in Los Angeles in protest, many
waving the Mexican flag - to the fury of the initiative's supporters. On
Wednesday about 10,000 schoolchildren, the majority Hispanic, walked out of
city classrooms to demonstrate.
Their teachers have also become vocal, with 1,000 signing a pledge to ignore
the provision in the proposition obliging them to report to the federal
government any case in which the parents of schoolchildren were suspected of
being illegal immigrants.
Several hospitals and medical associations have also threatened to refuse to
comply with the reporting provision, and have warned of the broader public
health consequences of denying care to illegal immigrants. Local chambers of
commerce, representing businesses with long histories of employing illegal
immigrants, remain generally opposed.
Mr Pete Wilson and Congressman Michael Huffington, Republican candidates for
governor and senator respectively, have remained steadfast in support of
Proposition 187, while their Democrat opponents, Ms Kathleen Brown and
Senator Dianne Feinstein, have campaigned against.
Mr Wilson's stand helped him move ahead of Ms Brown while the initiative
appeared to command broad support and has not hurt him since opposition to
it has grown. Mr Huffington, however, has been greatly embarrassed by the
disclosure that he had employed a British nanny without proper papers. One
poll out yesterday had Ms Feinstein 10 points to the good, but another had
Mr Huffington two points up.
Many other prominent state politicians have refused to take a position
either way. They include Mr Richard Riordan and Ms Susan Golding - very much
in the front line on immigration as mayors of Los Angeles and San Diego - on
the grounds that they do not want to encourage divisiveness in their cities.
Mr Dan Lungren, the state attorney-general locked in a tough re-election
battle, has also remained on the fence. On Monday he said he was 'legally
obliged' to defend Proposition 187 in the courts - lawsuits are inevitable
if it passes - but said he lacked the authority to prosecute teachers and
doctors for not reporting suspected illegal immigrants.
The movement against Proposition 187 may yet prompt a white suburban
backlash in its favour. As of now, it would probably pass, but Tuesday is a
long way off.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Ontario acts on workplace equality: A new law encouraging
employers to improve the lot of minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ontario hopes its new affirmative-action law will succeed where other
approaches have failed to improve work prospects for disadvantaged groups.
The Canadian province's Employment Equity Act, which took effect on
September 1, goes beyond voluntary compliance but stops short of the racial
and other quotas which have been favoured by some US states.
'We want the workplace to develop its own plan, which it wants to
implement,' says Ms Juanita Westmoreland Traore, the lawyer who is the
province's first employment equity commissioner.
The new law is designed to help four groups: women, visible minorities, the
disabled and aboriginals. It applies to every private-sector employer with
more than 50 people on the payroll, and to all government agencies with more
than 10 workers.
The government estimates that 17,000 employers and almost three-quarters of
the province's workers will be involved in the exercise.
A sizeable bureaucracy is being brought together to monitor progress. The
Employment Equity Commission, based in Toronto, has an annual budget of
CDollars 9.3m (Pounds 4.4m) and will eventually have a staff of about 100.
An employment equity tribunal is also being set up to hear complaints and
settle disputes.
Every employer must go through a step-by-step process over the next three
years: a campaign to inform workers about the law, consultation with them,
and production of an 'employment equity plan'.
The timetable is staggered, depending on the number of employees. For
instance, private-sector employers with more than 500 workers must have
their plans in place by March 1996.
The law is deliberately vague on the scope of the plans. It says only that
they should 'remove barriers and make reasonable progress towards achieving
employment equity'.
Ms Traore defines a barrier as 'a policy or practice that more negatively
affects the designated groups than others'. She adds: 'We expect that
employers will look to the spirit of the act and develop a plan that fits
it.'
As examples, she cites jobs which require 'Canadian experience' - a
criterion which cannot be met by new immigrants, a growing proportion of
whom are black or oriental. Some employers may have to rearrange work
schedules to take account of non-traditional religious holidays.
Ms Traore, who is black, stresses that the new law does not require disabled
people to be employed in jobs which require agility or physical strength.
But she draws a distinction between a job requirement and a tradition. The
latter would include the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's insistence a few
years ago - but subsequently withdrawn - that Sikh recruits forsake their
turbans for the Mounties' well-known Stetson.
The business community has mixed feelings about the new law. 'We expected
worse,' says a human resources manager at one large company. The manager
gives Ontario's Social Democratic government credit for consulting widely on
its proposals, and for watering down some of the harsher provisions before
they became law.
But Mr Joe Couto, an official at the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, asks
whether many companies, especially smaller ones, have the resources to carry
out extensive and often complex surveys and consultations. 'This is going to
be a boon for consultants,' he predicts.
Some businesses are concerned about a backlash from white male workers, who
could accuse employers of reverse discrimination.
Dofasco, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has tried to reduce these fears by
expanding its employment-equity efforts to include all employees. 'We're
trying to recognise that everyone has differences and that these don't
hinder their contribution to the workplace,' says Ms Linda Bishop, Dofasco's
manager for human resources planning.
Canada Trust, a large financial institution, has already identified several
ways in which it can further the interests of the four disadvantaged groups
without stirring resentment among the workforce at large.
The company has decided, for instance, to place job advertisements not only
in Toronto's mainstream dailies but also in newspapers catering to specific
ethnic groups. It is about to launch a 10-week pilot programme for potential
recruits who have developmental handicaps, such as dyslexia.
A year ago, Canada Trust introduced an 'alternate work option', which allows
all employees to choose flexible work hours, job sharing, work-at-home
options or any other arrangement which suits them without harming their
productivity.
'This is a business opportunity,' says Ms Heather Conolly, manager of
workplace equality. She also says, however, that complying with the new act
will require 'horrendous' paperwork.
Ms Traore acknowledges that the success of the new regime will hinge on
employers' enthusiasm. 'If it works the way we want it to work, it should
have its own inherent dynamism,' she says. 'People will see that it's in
their self-interest.'
There is little in the law to force compliance. No deadlines are set for
implementing employment equity plans. The law spells out a near-endless
process of consultation, mediation and appeals.
If all else fails, the employment equity tribunal can alter a plan. But if
the employer fails to comply, the tribunal can impose a maximum fine of only
CDollars 50,000 (Pounds 22,800) - which is unlikely to be high enough to
bring reluctant employers into the employment-equity fold.

The Berlusconi government is due to give its long-delayed approval today for
the appointment of Mr Vincenzo Desario as director-general of the Bank of
Italy. On October 18 the central bank's governing council named Mr Desario,
junior of the two deputy directors, to replace Mr Lamberto Dini, who became
treasury minister in May. But approval has been held up to register the
government's protest over the bank's refusal to let the right-wing coalition
chose an outside candidate. Mr Berlusconi yesterday met Mr Desario along
with Mr Dini, who opposed the choice of an internal candidate. The meeting
was intended to clear the air over the five-month row.

Hungary's Socialist-led government yesterday approved sweeping changes to
privatisation regulations, with the aim of completing the sale of most state
companies by the end of its term in 1998. To make administration of
privatisation more efficient and less expensive, Mr Laszlo Bekesi, finance
minister, said AVU, the state property agency, and AV Rt, the state holding
company, would be merged into a single company. Officials said the
government would aim for rapid sales rather than restructure companies ahead
of privatisation. Sales to cash bidders would be preferred, with revenue
generated from the sale of blue chip companies used to pay off state debt.
The new strategy envisaged greater use of the country's nascent capital
markets, Mr Bekesi said.

The Greek parliament has approved legislation allowing the partial
privatisation of OTE, the state telecoms monopoly through a flotation on the
Athens stock exchange. In a stormy session on Wednesday night, 12 deputies
from the governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, most of them ex-trade
union leaders, abstained or voted against the law. OTE employees, striking
in protest against the flotation, blocked traffic outside parliament. The
law calls for tariff increases of 40 per cent on local calls in 1995 and 9
per cent in each of the following two years, so that OTE's domestic network
can break even by 1997. The vote cleared the way for 25 per cent of the
company to be sold next month. Eighteen per cent will be placed with
institutions abroad and the remainder offered to local investors. The
government expects to raise more than Dr320bn (Pounds 850m) from the
flotation, but two-thirds will be set aside to fund OTE's five-year
modernisation plan.

FT  04 NOV 94 / German parties want to reimpose unification tax
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's three potential coalition partners yesterday agreed that a
controversial tax surcharge introduced shortly after the reunification of
East and West Germany in 1990 and dropped in 1993 should be reimposed.
In negotiations on a coalition programme, the Christian Democratic Union of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the Christian Social Union, its Bavarian-sister
party, and the liberal Free Democrats, promised to reduce the state's share
of GDP from 51 per cent to 46 per cent by 2000, cut 14,000 federal
government jobs, and introduce more privisatisation, particularly in the
transport sector and telecommnications.
Mr Erwin Huber, general secretary of the CSU, said all parties had agreed
that the 'solidarity' tax surcharge would be reintroduced next year since it
was a crucial instrument to reduce the budget deficit which had swelled
following financial transfers of DM150bn (Pounds 61bn) to eastern Germany
since reunification. The 7.5 per income tax surcharge is expected to raise
an annual DM27bn to DM29bn. The current deficit is DM68.8bn.
Until yesterday, the FDP had insisted that the coalition impose a timetable
for ending the tax, but Mr Theo Waigel said this week it was 'unrealistic'.
FDP officials said they 'could live with the compromise' in which the tax
will be reviewed annually.
However, Mr Werner Hoyer, general secretary of the FDP, won some other
concessions in the party's bid to reduce the role of the state, cut back the
bureaucracy and gain more financial assistance for the Mittelstand, the
small and medium-sized enterprises considered the backbone of the German
economy.
Massive public works, particularly for the infrastructure in eastern Germany
could be thrown open to the private sector.
Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, said the role of the state
would be further reduced as the coalition would attempt to scrap or decrease
the bureaucracy, while enterprises would be given more opportunity to
introduce part-time work as a means of promoting more employment.
'The next legislative period will try and push through more
debureaucratisation,' said Mr Hintze.

The campaign to win Swedish entry to the European Union was jolted yesterday
when an opinion poll showed a swing against membership, in contrast to other
recent polls showing the Yes side set for a narrow win in the referendum on
November 13. The latest poll, in the newspaper Aftonbladet, gave the No camp
38 per cent support against 36 per cent in favour of membership. Most
worrying for the Yes campaign, led by the Social Democratic prime minister,
Mr Ingvar Carlsson, and strongly supported by most of Sweden's political and
industrial establishment, was the poll's finding that significantly more of
the 25 per cent of voters yet to make up their minds were more inclined to
vote No than Yes. The poll was cited by market dealers as the main factor
behind a sharp rise in long-term interest rates and a weakening of the
Swedish krona yesterday.

The commander of Russia's Northern Fleet said yesterday a US submarine had
been discovered in territorial waters off the Arctic Kola peninsula and had
left only after being given several warnings. Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev said
the craft had been detected on Wednesday 8km off the entrance to the narrow
Kola Bay, which lies 30km from the huge top-secret naval base at
Severomorsk, home to the Northern Fleet. The foreign ministry said the boat
was located in almost exactly the same spot where the US nuclear submarine
Baton Rouge crashed into a Russian nuclear submarine in February 1992.
However, the Northern Fleet later said the vessel's identity had yet to be
confirmed.
Admiral Yerofeyev said that, given that Moscow had cut its naval operations,
'provocations by western submarines can only spark Russian worry and
condemnation'.

<TEXT>
A heavy combined force of Bosnian and Croat soldiers yesterday overran the
strategic town of Kupres in central Bosnia, in a substantial setback for the
Bosnian Serb army.
It is the first important town the Bosnian Serbs have lost since the early
days of the 31-month war in Bosnia and raises fears the war will spread,
possibly forcing Serbia proper to come to their aid. The Kupres plateau,
dubbed the door to Bosnia, is of strategic importance for all three
communities. The joint offensive yesterday fuelled speculation that Croats
and Moslems could now fight each other over Kupres, which was 51 per cent
Serb and 39 per cent Croat before the war broke out.
UN officials last night confirmed the presence of regular Croatian army
units in the fighting for Kupres, which casts a shadow over any prospects
for progress in Serbo-Croat peace talks. Fresh talks between Croat officials
and rebel Serbs from Krajina, the self-styled state in Croatia, ended
yesterday in Knin, the Serb stronghold just over the border in neighbouring
Croatia, with little sign of progress towards agreement. Yesterday, cracks
appeared for the first time in the news blackout on the conflict imposed by
Serbia. Belgrade radio reported the Serb setbacks against the week-long
Moslem offensive which it had completely ignored. The end of the media
blockade signals mounting pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia
from the Yugoslav army and within his ruling Socialists to re-supply
Serb-held lands in Bosnia. The Bosnian Serbs have blamed the blockade
imposed by Serbia three months ago for their recent losses.

German business yesterday warned that a robust economic recovery was in
danger of papering over persistent weaknesses in the economy, caused mainly
by pressure for higher wages and increased taxes.
'There are doubts about the steadiness of the recovery,' said Mr Franz
Schoser, a spokesman for the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHT),
which polled 25,000 companies for its autumn survey of business confidence.
The survey findings are a timely reminder for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new
government, already warned by the Employers Federation, which called for an
urgent restructuring of the social security system.
Many companies were waiting for the outcome of talks on forming the new
government, due to end in the next 10 days, before committing themselves to
medium-term strategy, the report said.
Companies in western Germany will still suffer from weaker consumer demand
next year, the report warned, caused by an array of taxes, including the
reintroduced solidarity surcharge for eastern Germany and new insurance and
health charges.
They are also worried that the wage talks in the spring will lead to higher
wage rises. The trade unions are likely to push for an extra 6 per cent
while Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the DIHT chairman, said recently pay rises close
to the inflation level, now just under 3 per cent, would be acceptable.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Yeltsin row may scare off IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing hostility between the Russian government and President Boris Yeltsin
is threatening to derail ambitious plans by the International Monetary Fund
to support the Russian economy next year.
Attempts by the president's Security Council to blame - and possibly remove
from office - important economic reformers following an inquiry into the
causes of the rouble's collapse last month may disincline the Fund to make
up to Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8.5bn) available to Moscow next year.
Observers believe Mr Yeltsin is now strongly opposed to government plans to
peg the currency and bring down inflation to 1 per cent a month next year.
The Fund supports the plan and it has latterly attracted the approval of the
Group of Seven nations.
The struggle burst into the open yesterday when Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy
prime minister in charge of the economy, said he would not work with
candidates now being considered for the post of finance minister who would
be drawn from the president's office. He said the tough 1995 budget, backed
by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, was a 'unique opportunity' to
break the cycle of high inflation which has dogged Russian reform for three
years.
The government is preparing a letter of intent which will be the basis on
which the IMF would advance loans of up to Dollars 14bn next year to fund
the budget deficit and to support the rouble if and when it is pegged to the
dollar. Though differences remain between the IMF and the government - on
the rate at which the rouble will be pegged and on whether the stabilisation
fund will be lodged with the government or retained under the control of the
IMF - the two sides agree on the basic parameters of the budget and on the
need for rapid action.
However, opponents of the budget, including Mr Alexander Livshits, an
economic adviser to Mr Yeltsin, have said they do not believe the economy
can support, or the parliament agree to, such a tough policy - and argue for
a target monthly inflation rate of 5 per cent next year, an option the
government considered and rejected in September. Such a target would be
highly unlikely to attract IMF or G7 support
The opponents have seized the opportunity afforded by the report of the
Security Council's commission - completed this week but unpublished - on the
events surrounding 'Black Tuesday' on October 11, when the rouble lost a
quarter of its value in one day.
The report blames the fall on Mr Shokhin, together with the former minister
of the economy, Mr Sergei Dubynin, and former central bank governor Mr
Victor Gerashchenko.
Both Mr Dubynin and Mr Gerashchenko resigned last month, and Mr Yeltsin
yesterday fired Mr Victor Krunya, director of the Federal Currency and
Export Control Service, for his part in the affair. Mr Shokhin, as the
senior remaining economic minister, is now in a precarious position, as is
the budget and the reform strategy. G7 officials believe the budget offers a
last chance to stabilise the rouble and bring down inflation to allow badly
needed domestic and foreign investment.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Cypriots join in the Aegean war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gap between Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot positions over the
island's future is widening ominously, at a time when Athens and Ankara are
already squaring off over territorial rights in the Aegean.
Greek-Cypriot officials have in the last few days accused both the Turkish
Cypriots and Ankara of renouncing the 1977 and 1979 agreements - calling for
the island to be reunited as a bi-zonal federation - which have served as
the basis for all subsequent negotiations.
Leaders of the island's Greek Cypriot majority have always argued for as
full-blooded a federation as possible, while the Turkish Cypriots want
relatively loose ties between mainly Greek and mainly Turkish zones.
Until recently, UN-sponsored negotiations have proceeded on the basis that a
federal Cyprus would be a sovereign state, albeit loosely structured.
But Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the new Turkish foreign minister who has called for a
tougher stance on Turkish-Greek disputes, caused a sensation in Athens this
week by saying that both parts of Cyprus were and would remain sovereign
entities.
He said the Cyprus problem was 'half-solved already' and all that remained
was for the two sides to agree on co-operation in such areas as tourism and
the environment.
The Turkish minister's words were denounced by the Cyprus government,
although there was quiet satisfaction among hardline Greek politicians, who
have all along doubted the value of reconciliation talks.
'We are at a worse impasse than before,' said Mr Alecos Michaelides, foreign
minister in the Greek Cypriot government. 'They (the Turkish Cypriots) are
now abandoning the idea of a federation . . . and this makes it difficult
even to start discussions.'
The Greek Cypriots are now expected to intensify pressure on the UN for a
statement that blames Turkish intransigence for the lack of progress. They
are also stepping up their campaign for accession to the European Union,
something the Turkish side opposes as long as there is no settlement.
In a separate Greek-Turkish dispute, Mr Soysal has again warned Athens that
Turkey will go to war if Greece exercises the option of extending its
territorial waters from six miles to 12 after November 16, when a new
international law on the sea enters force.

<TEXT>
Italy's annual inflation rate dropped by 0.1 per cent to 3.8 per cent in
October after two months of small increases. This year, growing business
confidence has led to autumn price rises being brought forward from October
to September. As a result, it was expected that inflation would fall in
October, but the reduction is less than predicted. The Bank of Italy's
quarterly bulletin, published this week, estimated 1994 inflation at 'around
4 per cent' against the official objective of 3.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent
in 1995.
Orders for west German manufactured goods recovered strongly in September,
rising 4.8 per cent on the month and more than 9 per cent on the level a
year earlier. The figures, which the economics ministry said were likely to
be revised upwards by up to one percentage point, showed a 12 per cent rise
in foreign demand and a 1 per cent increase in domestic orders.
Seasonally adjusted Danish unemployment fell sharply from 12.2 of the labour

328,400 jobless is the biggest monthly fall so far recorded. Unemployment
was 12.5 per cent in September last year.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Strike-hit Iberia's staff seek sacking of bosses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Spanish government is under strong pressure to sack the chairman of INI,
the public sector holding which owns Iberia, the state airline, together
with some of the airline's senior executives after most flights were
grounded yesterday in a worsening pay dispute.
Amid signs that the two main unions which called yesterday's stoppage risk
losing control over the dispute, minority unions, representing ground staff
as well as cabin crews, have called for partial stoppages today and more
strikes over the next month.
Iberia has warned that an escalation of the protest, called to demand
overdue back pay and in protest at proposed staff and salary cuts, would
cripple the company financially. The airline is due to declare losses of
Pta44bn (Pounds 216m) this year and yesterday's stoppage is estimated to
have cost Iberia up to Pta1bn in lost revenue.
In a new twist to the dispute, the airline's middle management has taken the
unprecedented step of calling on the government to remove senior executives
of both INI and Iberia. More than 500 of Iberia's 1,300-strong technical and
intermediate level personnel signed a letter to the industry minister
blaming senior management for the company's difficulties, and stressing that
no viability plan would be accepted by the airline's staff while they
remained in place.
A spokesman for the organisers of the petition said there was now a serious
risk that the dispute could run out of control because hardline minority
unions were planning new stoppages and undermining the authority of the
socialist-led General Workers Union and the communist-dominated Workers
Commissions union, which had jointly initiated the strike action.
'Unless there is a big top-level shake-up this strike is going to match in
violence the one at Air France last year,' the spokesman said.
The October 1993 Air France strike cost Mr Bernard Attali his job as the
airline's chairman and forced the French government to revise drastic
spending cuts for the company which were similar to those envisaged now by
Iberia.
The airline has proposed pay cuts averaging 15 per cent over the next three
years, accompanied by 2,000 further job cuts as part of a viability plan
which combines reducing operating costs by 10 per cent with a capital
injection of Pta125bn (Pounds 613m).
The targets of employee anger are Mr Juan Saenz, who was appointed Iberia's
managing director last year, and Mr Javier Salas, the chairman of INI and,
since September 1993, also president of Iberia.
As INI chairman Mr Salas endorsed an ambitious airline investment programme
by Iberia in Latin America which lies at the heart of the company's present
financial difficulties. INI is now seeking authorisation from the European
Union to use subsidies for the recapitalisation.
The industry minister, Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, who is responsible for INI
and has an ultimate say over Iberia and the group's other companies, is
understood to be increasingly dissatisfied with INI's leadership. Criticism
of the public sector holding company is also rife among members of the
government's economic team, appalled at its mounting losses - Pta125bn in
1993, up from Pta72bn the previous year.

<TEXT>
German business yesterday warned that a robust economic recovery was in
danger of papering over persistent weaknesses in the economy, caused mainly
by pressure for higher wages and increased taxes.
'There are doubts about the steadiness of the recovery,' said Mr Franz
Schoser, a spokesman for the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHT),
which polled 25,000 companies for its autumn survey of business confidence.
The survey findings are a timely reminder for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new
government already warned by the Employers Federation, which called for an
urgent restructuring of the social security system.
Many of the companies surveyed are waiting for the outcome of talks on
forming the new government, due to end in the next 10 days, before
committing themselves to medium-term strategy, the report said.
Companies in western Germany will still suffer from weaker consumer demand
next year, the report warned, caused by an array of taxes, including the
reintroduced solidarity surcharge for eastern Germany and new insurance and
health charges.
They are also worried that the wage talks in the spring will lead to higher
wage rises. The trade unions are likely to push for an extra 6 per cent
while Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the DIHT chairman, said recently that a pay rise
close to the inflation level, now just under 3 per cent, would be acceptable
following a round of zero pay rises this year.
Despite the economic recovery only 9 per cent of west German companies said
they were planning to hire new staff, up from 5 per cent this time last
year; 28 per cent said they would be shedding jobs.
The report also warned that machine running times were too slow and that
more and more companies were moving production facilities abroad to take
advantage of cheaper labour costs.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Turks turn full force of rage on Kurds: John Barham reports
on one of the biggest offensives in 10 years of war against the PKK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turkey's security forces have launched one of their largest offensives yet
in the 10-year war against guerrillas of the separatist Kurdistan Workers
party (PKK). They aim to crush the insurgency in the heavily Kurdish
south-east once and for all by destroying the PKK's stores and supply routes
before winter sets in.
The month-old campaign is the climax of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's
hardline anti-PKK policy. She abandoned former President Turgut Ozal's
search for reconciliation on taking office in June 1993, just after
guerrillas ended a short-lived ceasefire by massacring 32 unarmed soldiers.
But the conflict not only costs lives - 13,000 have died since fighting
started in 1984 - it is also warping society, undermining the economy and
distancing Turkey from its western allies.
The cost of fighting the PKK - estimated at Dollars 3bn-Dollars 7bn a year -
is bankrupting the government, which finances its deficits by borrowing and
printing money.
For a month, helicopters and jets have blasted away at suspected rebel
hideouts in the rugged Munzur mountains of Tunceli province. Troops and
guerrillas are clashing daily.
The government claims the offensive is working. Troops have seized caches of
stores and the army says guerrillas are surrendering at a rate of two or
three a day. Mr Davud Haner, Tunceli's assistant governor, is confident that
'sooner or later' the PKK will be eliminated.
Few western analysts would agree. Previous 'final offensives' have failed.
Half Turkey's 500,000-strong army is based in the south-east, but the PKK,
probably numbering less than 20,000, battles on.
Turkish conscripts are poorly trained, badly motivated and do not know the
region. The PKK generally keeps the initiative, raiding villages and
military outposts. Large areas of the south-east are no-go areas. Harsh
mountain terrain provides well-protected staging areas and cover from air
attack. Turkey's enemies, notably Syria, have armed and trained the PKK.
Far from winning hearts and minds, crack anti-guerrilla 'special teams' are
hated for their brutality. The army's strategy of razing villages to deny
them to the PKK further alienates local populations. Mr Musa Tok, a
70-year-old Kurdish peasant who fled his village near Tunceli, said:
'Soldiers gave me 10 days to clear out. What can I do? My father died
defending Turkey and now I am being moved off my land.'
A US human rights campaigner says that the PKK is probably more brutal than
the army. 'But the army has totally over-reacted and driven a basically
apathetic people towards the PKK.'
Each new PKK outrage increases support for tougher action. In September,
guerrillas murdered six teachers for teaching in Turkish rather than
Kurdish.
Ominously, Mrs Ciller's uncompromising approach is one of her weak coalition
government's few popular policies. She is dragging her feet on promises to
reform security laws that allow police to detain anyone suspected of the
vaguely-defined crimes of 'separatism' or terrorism. By giving the generals
responsibility for eliminating the PKK, she has further entrenched their
considerable political power. Last month the army prevented Turkish MPs -
including the deputy prime minister - from visiting areas of Tunceli where,
according to media reports, troops were burning villages.
Remarkably, these reports sparked an anguished public debate over army
operations in the south-east. Until now, most Turks have viewed the army as
guiltless in its fight against the PKK. Yet Amnesty International has often
accused the security forces of exacting fearsome reprisals on civilians for
guerrilla attacks. It also suspects security forces of torturing and
assassinating opposition activists.
Human rights violations disturb Turkey's allies. The US has cut aid to
Turkey. In October, the European parliament suspended ties with Turkey's
parliament in protest at the treason trial of 15 Kurdish MPs. Strasbourg is
demanding the right to debate ratification of the customs union with Turkey
scheduled for 1996. If it does so, it could well reject the customs union, a
cornerstone of Turkish foreign policy.
Western governments repeatedly tell Turkish officials that a purely military
approach cannot work. They urge the government to isolate the PKK by
offering regional autonomy and allowing education and broadcasting in
Kurdish.
But Mr Ecvet Tezcan, a foreign ministry official, says: 'We are going to
fight. There is no other way out. Europe should understand that this is a
question of our survival (as a state).'
The south-east is Turkey's most backward region, still in the grip of feudal
landlords. Although the government spends lavishly on infrastructure in the
region, notably the Dollars 10bn GAP hydroelectric project, the expenditure
benefits few local people.
Mr Mazlum Arslan, Tunceli's moderate mayor, says: 'As well as fighting
terrorism, the government must provide jobs, roads, freedom and democracy.
We are all totally against terrorism. But if you do not provide this, you
(justify) them.'

FT  04 NOV 94 / Cabinet forced to cancel Post Office sell-off: Heseltine
'dismayed' after defeat by rebel Tory backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's legislative programme was in disarray yesterday after the
cabinet cancelled Post Office privatisation in the face of implacable
opposition from a handful of Conservative backbenchers.
After weeks of uncertainty, ministers accepted warnings from Mr Richard
Ryder, chief whip, that at least eight Tory backbenchers would vote against
a privatisation bill, ensuring its defeat in the Commons.
The decision was greeted with dismay by the Post Office, which has
campaigned hard for greater commercial freedom. Mr Michael Heron, chairman,
said the corporation faced 'crippling uncertainty' about its future.
The cabinet retreat was a severe blow for Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, who was forced to admit that last-minute attempts to
find a compromise were doomed to failure. He admitted: 'I have no idea how
we are going to move forward from where we are now. That is the problem we
now have to address.'
Mr Heseltine also lost a cabinet battle with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, who blocked a fall-back position that would have given the Post
Office substantial commercial freedom within the public sector.
Mr Clarke, a strong supporter of privatisation, refused to accept changes to
the Treasury's borrowing rules for state-owned companies which would be
needed to remove financial controls from the Post Office.
Mr Heseltine said it was a 'sad day' for Royal Mail, the Post Office's
letter delivery subsidiary, which faces growing competition from private
companies and overseas post offices.
'I find it extremely distressing to see Royal Mail having its markets eaten
into by American and Australian multinational transportation companies. I'm
depressed by the fact that the Dutch and the Germans are moving into private
capital in their postal services,' he said.
The climbdown leaves an embarrassing gap at the centre of the government's
legislative programme for the next session of parliament, which will be
announced in the Queen's Speech on November 16. Ministers pointed to Mr
Heseltine's proposed bill to deregulate the domestic gas market as a
substitute centrepiece, but rightwingers claimed the retreat as evidence
that the government has lost its way.
The only other surprise in the government's legislative programme of about a
dozen bills is expected to be a disabled rights bill. Other key measures
will include bills to equalise pensions, tighten unemployment benefit rules,
and increase contributions to the European Union.
Downing Street said that efforts to increase the Post Office's efficiency
and competitiveness would continue.
The most likely changes include investment in automation, and more contracts
with private sector companies to increase services such as bill paying.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the decision
was 'a massive rebuff for the government and a personal humiliation for
Michael Heseltine'. Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW
communications union, said privatisation 'has finally bitten the dust, never
to rear its ugly head again'.

FT  04 NOV 94 / CBI calls for urgent action to reduce long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic recovery in Britain will not solve the problem of the country's
1.5m long-term unemployed, the Confederation of British Industry warned
yesterday in a report welcomed by the Labour party and trade unions.
The CBI said it would need urgent state action to reduce the number of
people out of work for more than six months. It would also need a commitment
from employers to recruit the long-term unemployed and greater willingness
from the jobless to take available work.
The employers' organisation urged the government to increase incentives for
the unemployed to return to work and called for the reform of the state
employment service. It stressed that such measures would not add to state
spending.
The CBI said the state employment service should be made more sensitive to
employers' needs. It also said the service should equip the jobless with
basic skills of literacy and numeracy. It urged employers to make more use
of the employment service to fill vacancies while the jobless were called on
to train for new jobs as unskilled manual work declines.
Mr Ian McCartney, Labour's employment spokesman, welcomed the CBI
initiative. 'This is an unprecedented report by employers, calling for
active intervention to end mass unemployment,' he said.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the report was a very positive
step. 'It shows widespread recognition across the political spectrum of the
problems of the long-term unemployed,' he said.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said unless immediate steps
were taken to reduce long-term unemployment, wage-led inflation could
re-emerge as the labour market tightened because of skill shortages.
A survey of 450 employers carried out for the CBI by the Gallup poll
organisation revealed widespread criticism of the state employment service.
Over half the companies said they had never heard of any of the government
employment schemes that cost about Pounds 1.5bn a year.
In a CBI survey of the long-term jobless, about 28 per cent said the low
wages on offer compared with the welfare available was a handicap to
rejoining the labour market.
In a separate report, the six-man independent panel of economic forecasters
advising the Treasury also suggested changes to cut the cost of employing
people on low wages and a new income tax and National Insurance system to
make it more attractive to hire the unskilled.

FT  04 NOV 94 / MMM chief targets UK for pyramid sales schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergei Mavrodi, chairman of the MMM financial company whose rise and fall
this year made him the symbol of freewheeling Russian capitalism, said
yesterday that he would offer British investors the chance to buy into his
notorious pyramid schemes.
'The tickets (share coupons) are now being printed. We really mean to do it.
I could operate successfully in Britain, and you will see that for yourself
soon,' he told a press conference yesterday.
Mr Mavrodi has found a large role for himself in the new Russia. He won fame
with MMM, which promised, and initially paid, gains to a claimed 10m
customers in a crumbling scheme that made him a folk hero.
From the beginning of the year MMM promised, and to many delivered, wealth
through the purchase of shares - whose value rose from Rbs1,600 in February
to Rbs115,000 by July. But the 'shares' were quoted on no exchange, invested
in nothing and rose by fiat of MMM and Mr Mavrodi.
MMM seemed to have no means of making money other than the constant selling
of its rapidly-rising shares. After government warnings on its solvency, it
admitted its virtual collapse on July 29, telling investors it had nearly
run out of cash and offering them 950 roubles (US40 cents) per share.
Jailed in September on still-pending charges of tax evasion, Mr Mavrodi
nevertheless won a by-election in the Moscow suburb of Mytishchi on Sunday.
He had the support of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats - which he
called social democrats until corrected.
There was an angry response by several thousand shareholders outside his
offices earlier this week when MMM announced that the shares would not be
redeemed until the beginning of next year, but he remains in the
moon-promising business.
'There is no need to panic,' he said. 'In two months I will put MMM in order
and then the shareholders will gain once more. Look, you only have to go to
our selling points to see the thousands of people queueing up to buy the new
shares - more than ever before.'
His first task as a parliamentarian, he said, is to heal MMM. Mr Mavrodi is
vague on what he stands for: 'I will appeal to deputies from all factions .
. . I haven't defined my politics yet.'
A light-hearted question on whether or not he planned to run for the
presidency of his country drew a thoughtful response. 'It will be a heavy
burden to bear,' he said.

FT  04 NOV 94 / Rowland to quit Lonrho board: Defeat in bitter battle with
Bock marks the end of 33-year reign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON

<TEXT>
Mr Tiny Rowland is to retire from the board of Lonrho, following a
protracted and bitter struggle with his fellow joint chief executive, Mr
Dieter Bock.
His departure after 33 years at the helm of Lonrho will remove from the UK
corporate scene one of its most controversial and charismatic characters.
Mr Rowland was once described by Mr Edward Heath, the former prime minister,
as the 'unacceptable face of capitalism', but created virtually from scratch
an international trading group encompassing mines in Africa, a chain of
international hotels and a complex web of other interests.
After two days of tempestuous negotiations between the warring chief
executives, Mr Rowland yesterday agreed to surrender his executive
responsibilities at the end of the year and to retire from the board
altogether in March.
If shareholders agree, he will then be given the honorific title of
president, allowing him to continue to visit African and Middle Eastern
heads of state in the company Gulfstream jet.
Mr Rowland, who is 76, has fought off previous attempts to remove him from
the company, but his colleagues said yesterday that the battle appeared to
have been won by Mr Bock. 'The papers are signed,' said one. 'It is a done
deal.'
According to a Lonrho director, Mr Rowland's reaction when told two days ago
that a majority of the board were in favour of his departure was 'I will see
you in hell first'. But it was made clear to Mr Rowland by the company's
chairman, Sir John Leahy, that 'he had no option'.
In the previous few days, Sir John - a retired diplomat who is only a
temporary chairman - had taken informal soundings from the board. Directors
were resolved to offer Mr Rowland the 'opportunity to make an elegant exit',
according to a financier.
However, they were equally determined that they would not take 'no' for an
answer.
Mr Rowland will continue to receive his salary of Pounds 1.24m, plus
expenses and benefits, until the end of next year. His 'benefits' last year
included Pounds 470,000 towards the costs of running his homes in London and
Buckinghamshire, and his expenses were more than Pounds 1m.
Mr Paul Spicer, a longstanding ally of Mr Rowland who retired from the
Lonrho board earlier this year said that his old friend had achieved one
significant victory. Under a new arrangement relating to Mr Rowland's 6.5
per cent shareholding in the company, Mr Bock - who holds 18.8 per cent - no
longer has the right to force Mr Rowland to sell him his shares on leaving
the company at the end of next year.
Mr Spicer said: 'He did not want to leave them (the shares) under the
control of Mr Bock.'
The contract paving the way for Mr Rowland's departure was signed by him at
4pm yesterday. It was then ratified by the company's board at a meeting
which began at 4.30pm and which Mr Rowland did not attend.
Mr Bock, who joined Lonrho at the beginning of 1993 when he bought his stake
in the company, has had an uneasy relationship with Mr Rowland for more than
a year.
He felt that his plans to reorganise Lonrho, which owns around 500
companies, were being frustrated by Mr Rowland.
Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland. Hours
before September's board meeting, he backed off from proposing that Mr
Rowland should step down, fearing he could not count on the support of the
board.
Since then, two of Mr Rowland's closest supporters have resigned from the
board.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: SBC forecasts drop in income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, said annual
consolidated net income for 1994 would be 'clearly below' last year's record
SFr1.37bn (Dollars 1.1bn).
SBC said operating income after nine months failed to match 1993's
performance. The bank was echoing recent statements from Switzerland's two
other large banks.
No figures were given, but the bank blamed the uncertainty in financial
markets for most of the decline.
The trend of trading income was the same as in the first half of the year,
when it tumbled 63 per cent. Income from securities trading picked up in the
third quarter, but revenues from foreign exchange were down.
Net commission income, up 11 per cent in the first half, was down in the
third quarter because of a fall in brokerage and syndication and placement
fees.
Net interest income was higher than in the first and second quarters of this
year due to a more favourable funding structure and falling interest
provisions, but remained lower than in the third quarter of last year.
There was a further drop in bad loan provisions in the third quarter after
the 53 per cent cut in the first half.
Total assets of the parent company at September 30 stood at SFr195.5bn,
SFr13.3bn higher than at the end of last year. Growth in domestic lending
and interbank business offset the adverse affect of the lower US dollar, and
the acquisition of a Swiss regional bank added SFr4.7bn.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Akzo Nobel profit surges 35% on
increased sales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit before extraordinary
items rose 34.7 per cent in the third quarter. This reflected increased
sales volumes and reduced costs.
The sharp improvement was seen in most divisions, with even the weak fibres
sector producing a small profit after losses a year earlier.
Net profit totalled Fl 322m (Dollars 192m) before extraordinary items,
compared with Fl 239m a year earlier. Profits after extraordinary items
jumped 75 per cent because the 1993 result was weighed down by Fl 55m in
charges related to spinning off loss-making activities into joint ventures.
There were no extraordinary items in the 1994 quarter.
Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director, said the result confirmed expectations
that second-half results in 1994 would be above those in 1993. The company
held its interim dividend at Fl 1.50 a share.
Economic recovery in Europe, coupled with continued good business conditions
in the US, lifted sales volumes 5 per cent. Average selling prices rose 2
per cent, but Akzo Nobel faced a similar rate of increase in its own raw
material costs.
Turnover rose 4.3 per cent to Fl 5.42bn, and would have been higher but for
the dollar's decline.
Operating profit rose by Fl 129m to Fl 487m, producing a margin of 9.0 per
cent against 6.9 per cent. 'All groups contributed to this gain in operating
income, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales,' Mr Bergsma
said.
Chemicals, coatings and pharmaceuticals posted increases in operating
profit, while fibres produced a small operating profit of Fl 1m, compared
with a loss of Fl 32m a year earlier.
The company, created in early 1994 through the acquisition of Sweden's Nobel
Industries by Akzo of the Netherlands, was already reaping some synergy
benefits, such as personnel cutbacks in Stockholm. But Bergsma said the bulk
of the savings would come in 1995 and 1996, rather than mainly in 1995, as
originally expected.

Roussel Uclaf, one of France's largest chemicals companies, yesterday
reported net income up 9.2 per cent at FFr635m (Dollars 123.75m) for the
first nine months of the year.
The company said comparable net income, excluding exceptional items, was
FFr715m,a 52 per cent rise. This was after stripping out restructuring costs
and capital gains from the transfer of its crop protection and environmental
health activities.
The divisions will be transferred to part of the Hoechst group, the German
chemicals company which owns 54 per cent of Roussel Uclaf's shares, at the
end of this month.
Sales for the period were up 13.8 per cent to FFr13.1bn, or up 2.3 per cent
in comparable terms. Canal Plus, the French media and pay-TV company,
reported revenues up 8.5 per cent to FFr6.85bn for the first nine months of
the year, compared with the 1993 period.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Two deals shake Italy's banks: Takeover and merger proposals
could tighten banking ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shape of Italian banking altered sharply yesterday following two moves
which will tighten ownership of the industry in the private sector.
Following days of speculation within the industry, Ambroveneto is to be
taken over by Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) to create the country's
second-largest banking group while Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the
Bologna-based bank, plans to merge with the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna
group (Caer) the regional savings institution.
Rolo's merger plan is an attempt to fight off a hostile bid by the recently
privatised Credito Italiano.
The Comit takeover of Ambroveneto has been market gossip for several days;
but the Rolo-Caer merger came as a surprise. It would create Italy's 10th
largest bank and comes less than a month after the two had abandoned talks
on a smaller-scale merger.
Comit said it wanted to purchase 51 per cent of Ambroveneto but would aim
initially for 29 per cent of the stock held by the core of controlling
shareholders. It offered L7,000 per share for the 144.4m shares among these
shareholders.
The defensive move by Rolo, controlled by a core of shareholders led by Mr
Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, will have to overcome some
complex legal considerations. These centred upon whether a merger could
occur while a takeover bid was in progress.
The formal takeover by Credito Italiano cannot be launched until the
prospectus has been approved by Consob, the stock exchange watchdog and this
is unlikely to be complete until November 15. This could mean that the first
extraordinary meeting of Rolo shareholders will hear not the takeover offer
but the merger.
The L2,010bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Credito bid for 48.2 per cent of Rolo's stock
valuing each share at L19,000 was launched last Wednesday, and was the
largest in Italy since new takeover rules were introduced in 1992. It
followed three weeks of heavy trading in Rolo shares which rose in price by
more than 30 per cent.
Rolo's merger decison comes after the appointment of foreign advisors,
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to assess the takeover. Rolo said the
merger would be on the basis of 1.31 of its nominal L1,000 shares for every
nominal L10,000 Caer share.
Rolo has a market capitalisation of L4,895bn. This is a premium of some
L3,000 per share on that offered by Credito and applies to all the shares.
Caer was valued at L2,397bn.
Caer is a holding company with 76.4 per cent of the Cassa di Risparmio di
Bologna (Carisbo), the savings bank. Caer in turn is controlled, like most
savings banks, by a foundation which has 93 per cent of the stock. If the
merger were to go through, the foundation would possess 30 per cent of the
new group, probably to be called Rolo-Cassa.
The two have discussed a limited merger for the past year. The deal
collapsed partly because it was too narrow in scope and applied only to a
share-swap with Carisbo. Faced with the threat of being gobbled up by
Milan-based Credito, they appear to have quickly overcome these reservations
and broadened the scope of the original merger.
Rolo called extraordinary shareholders meetings on December 19 and 20 to
approve the defensive deal.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Burma's junta defiant as US presses for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The most senior US delegation to visit Burma in six years left Rangoon
yesterday without apparently receiving any assurance from the country's
military rulers that they intend to embark on significant political reforms.
Mr Thomas Hubbard, US deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asian and
Pacific affairs, said in Bangkok after the two-day visit that moves by the
junta towards political reconciliation would improve US-Burmese relations,
but failure to make progress 'would lead to further restrictions on our
political and economic ties'.
Mr Hubbard, accompanied by US officials from the National Security Council
and agencies concerned with human rights and drug trafficking, had three
hours of talks with Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, head of military intelligence. The US
visit follows two meetings between Gen Khin Nyunt and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,
the democracy campaigner held under house arrest in Rangoon for more than
five years.
Few details of those meetings have emerged, and Mr Hubbard said Gen Khin
Nyunt did not divulge any details; nor has the junta let the US delegation
meet her or other political prisoners. Burma's armed forces have been in
power since 1962. They crushed a popular uprising in 1988, and ignored the
results of an election in 1990 which Ms Suu Kyi's National League for
Democracy won overwhelmingly.
The US has pursued a policy of isolating the junta, downgrading its
diplomatic ties and preventing the disbursement of aid funds from
multilateral bodies such as the World Bank.
'We would like to see a genuine national reconciliation,' said Mr Hubbard.
'We hope it won't be necessary to downgrade our relationship further.' The
US officials were subjected to a long lecture by Gen Khin Nyunt about
Burmese history since the time of British colonial rule, and they in turn
lectured the general about the need for moves towards democracy.
It emerged from the meeting that the International Committee of the Red
Cross would soon be allowed 'a role with regard to political prisoners',
that Gen Khin Nyunt had promised to continue talks with Ms Suu Kyi, and that
the junta had authorised a survey of Burma's opium crop, which accounts for
much of the world's heroin supply.

Vietnam has failed in its push to keep price increases in single figures for
1994, the government's statistics department said in its weekly review, when
reporting 11.3 per cent inflation in the first 10 months. A big increase in
food costs, apparently because of higher prices for rice caused by floods in
the Mekong Delta and market fluctuations, fuelled a 1.3 per cent rise in the
retail price index in October, The National Assembly again set single-digit
inflation as the target when it fixed economic goals for 1995 at its last
meeting of a 12-day session on Tuesday.

More than 410 people were killed in southern Egypt yesterday, most of them
when blazing fuel flooded into a village from a depot struck by lightning,
officials in the town of Assiut said, Reuter reports from Assiut.
A health official said hospitals had received 229 corpses from the stricken
village of Dronka; a security official said another 122 corpses were still
lying on the ground there. Flooding killed 63 others, the official said.
Lightning struck the complex of eight fuel tanks holding 15,000 tonnes of
aircraft and motor fuel after a thunderstorm had raged for at least five
hours, an Assiut official said.
The complex was still on fire at 6 pm local time. A new blaze had started in
another storage tank. Firefighters decided to let the fire burn itself out.
The governor of Assiut Province declared a state of emergency, sending in
rescue units and army firefighters to try to control the flames.
The missing included at least 10 men trapped in a mosque during prayers and
a maintenance crew working inside the storage complex. The fuel tanks are
operated by a subsidiary of the state-run Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC).
EGPC officials in Cairo declined to comment on the incident. One said a team
of experts was travelling to Assiut to assess the damage to the tanks, used
as a strategic fuel reserve for the defence ministry. Meteorologists in
Cairo said the storm was one of the worst in Egypt's history.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Ukrainians take wintery road to market: Matthew Kaminski
finds despair in Kiev as economic reforms send prices soaring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Khreshatyk metro station in central Kiev, a new monthly transport
pass was pasted behind a grimy window, with the price scribbled in pencil.
'Today it's 175,000,' a middle-aged woman laughed scornfully. Last month it
was 20,000 coupons (about 20 US cents). 'I don't know how we're going to
live through this,' she said.
Across Kiev this week, drastic price increases affected transport, rents,
utilities and food, along with other retail goods under an IMF-tailored
austerity programme unveiled by President Leonid Kuchma last month.
The price increases are the clearest indication yet that painful 'shock
therapy' market reform, which was pioneered by Poland five years ago and is
already transforming the economy of much of eastern Europe, has finally made
it to Ukraine. Earning an average monthly wage of around 2.3m coupons (about
Dollars 23), Ukrainians are in for a painful passage into the market
economy.
But if Kiev's leaders - emulating their neighbours in Warsaw, Prague and
Tallinn - can ignore public grumbling long enough to put into place the
remaining pieces of a comprehensive reform programme, their country could
have a chance to join in the economic boom now taking off in the more
progressive nations of eastern Europe.
This week's metro fare increase was accompanied by a drastic 10-fold rise in
the price of trolley and tram tickets, and a seven-fold increase in rents,
and utilities. Food prices varied across regions, but with state subsidies
completely turned off they are also set to rise quickly.
The first wave of price increases is due to be followed by another on
January 1. Ukrainian wages and pensions went up last month, but only to 80
per cent of expected price increases. 'It's impossible to live on our
salaries,' said Mrs Olha Stepanovich, a teacher who shops at the popular
Vladimirsky market. 'Only a businessman can afford tomatoes for 150,000
coupons per kilogram. So most people just do not eat well.'
Ukraine's social fabric is already stretched thin. The country has Europe's
lowest minimum wage and highest hidden unemployment rate.
The average real wage is down 70 per cent since 1990. However, many
supplement their incomes in the black economy which, by one count, makes up
60 per cent of economic activity.
However, as in Poland during 'shock therapy', people expect to improvise and
survive. 'It's hard but we get by,' said Mrs Valentina Mykhailovych, a
pensioner, standing outside a state bread store on Karl Marx Street. 'My son
has a dacha outside Kiev where he grows vegetables. So my husband and I get
fresh potatoes and carrots.'
Factories have been hit hard, with higher oil and coal prices and an
inability to acquire cheap dollars to import energy. Many enterprises are
expected to close and lay off workers. State spending cuts also are needed
to reduce Ukraine's large budget deficit.
Reformers hope the pain will be brief - and checked by high interest rates
to stop inflation. They are also relying on foreign capital being lured back
as the currency stabilises and supplies of Russian and Turkmen energy are
guaranteed - bought with western aid such as the Dollars 371m IMF loan
approved last week.
But Mr Kuchma recognises the public disquiet. 'To my great regret, ordinary
people will not be affected by the arrival of this small amount (the IMF
loan),' he said. 'That is why I appeal to our people to have more patience.'
The president also knows western donors, sitting on up to Dollars 4bn in
aid, have little patience. Ukraine must implement the first radical
macroeconomic reforms in the next nine weeks to qualify for further IMF aid.
Talks on a Dollars 1.5bn stand-by begin later this month.
But the political opposition is gathering steam, too. Parliament, dominated
by a communist coalition, called an emergency session for tomorrow to
discuss the price rises. Organised labour, quiet since last year's coal
strikes, this week threatened to walk out in protest against price increases
and low, or often unpaid, wages.
Mr Kuchma yesterday succeeded in convincing municipal leaders to implement
bread price increases in all regions after widespread resistance to
implementing his decrees.
At the Karl Marx bread store, the night delivery man shrugged his shoulders
as he unloaded the daily rye: 'Sadly, all these changes are needed.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (8): Range of
participants widens - The industry / A look at the range of finance
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would you buy a car through a merchant bank? Would you ask the people who
make or sell your television set for a loan?
Though the instinctive answer to both questions is 'probably not', the
percentage of individuals and businesses who respond positively demonstrates
the wide range of companies in the consumer credit and asset finance
industry.
A glance down the membership list of the Finance and Leasing Association
reveals some implausible participants: the Automobile Association, Kodak,
Marks and Spencer, and Rank Xerox are all among the organisations with
offshoots in this area of finance.
This does not mean, however, that these or the more predictable financial
institutions in this sector are all in direct competition. Rather, it
reflects the varied types of finance with which the sector deals.
At one end of the scale are the unsecured personal loans - perhaps with a
minimum of Pounds 500 - offered by all the leading high street financial
institutions. At the other end are the asset finance arrangements set up by
merchant banks as part of the financing services they provide to their large
corporate clients.
'We have done tiny, tiny deals as favours,' says Andrew White, joint head of
financing at Kleinwort Benson where the main lines of asset finance are in
the vehicle, information technology and aerospace markets. 'But ideally we
don't want to do a deal below Pounds 2m.'
Between these extremes is a range of finance where there is room for
mainstream providers and companies which have identified specific niches to
win substantial shares of relatively narrow markets.
For example, First National Bank, the core consumer finance arm of First
National Finance Corporation, specialises in providing suppliers of home
improvement goods and services with financing deals they can offer customers
at the point of sale.
Point-of-sale finance is just one way in which competition to provide or
arrange finance between merchandisers as well as to provide the more
conventional sources of funds is intensifying.
Take the case of someone buying a new kitchen or double glazing. These
customers might think first of obtaining finance from the bank or building
society with which they deal. But they are also potential financial clients
for the retailer or manufacturer from whom they are buying.
The principles are the same in corporate business. A company replacing a
fleet of cars might consider approaching the merchant bank which advises it
about the other aspects of its financial arrangements, but, equally, will
face a determined effort from motor companies to win its business.
The varied backgrounds and structures of consumer finance organisations
enables them to put forward different selling spiels, from convenience to
financial expertise or long experience in the goods or services being
sought.
All the largest clearing banks have their own finance houses through which
they offer leasing and structured finance for personal customers and small
businesses, directly or through the bank itself.
The growing importance of finance houses is illustrated by their increasing
contribution to bank profits. In turn, the finance houses believe that being
part of a larger banking group can also assist their business.
For example, Forward Trust, Midland Bank's finance house, says the main
benefit is in the competitive and attractive funding rates it can offer as
part of the larger organisation.
Less important, there is also the prospect of referrals from customers who
approach the banks through its branches.
Like the finance houses in the banks, consumer finance arms of building
societies say that their position in the group gives them the benefit not
just of the scale of inquiries but also of the brand name.
'Customers know and trust the organisation,' says Richard Roche, head of
marketing at Alliance &amp; Leicester Personal Finance.
There is, however, a restriction on the type of consumer finance building
societies can offer. Although relaxations in rules are on the way, at
present societies cannot lend for business purposes.
This can lead to difficult decisions in dealing with sole traders. A taxi
driver applying for a car loan would have to be turned down if it was
obvious that the vehicle would be used for business, but a plumber wishing
to buy a car would be eligible for a loan unless the vehicle was primarily
for business use.
Different restrictions can apply where a consumer finance arm is part of a
broader organisation.
At Marks and Spencer, for example, the financial services operation is
expanding next year to add life insurance and pensions to the charge cards,
personal loans and unit trusts it already offers. But earlier this year,
Keith Oates, joint managing director, stressed: 'We are first and foremost a
retailer. Our financial services arm ought to be allowed to expand as it
thinks fit without disturbing the plan for the whole group.'
Ford Credit, part of the financial services subsidiary of Ford Motors,
readily acknowledges it is a 'captive'. It says, however, that this does not
unduly hamper its operation or development. Under the terms of the European
Second Banking Co-ordination Directive it is a bank in its own right, and in
1993 it was among the top 10 finance houses in the UK.
Whatever their parent organisations, consumer credit and asset finance
operations face opportunities and challenges in the months ahead.
The good news is that much of it should benefit from the recovery as
businesses re-tool for expansion: in particular, the car market generally
responds quickly to growth in the economy.
What is not such good news is that margins are narrowing. As one asset
financier put it: 'Foreign competitors are coming back to the UK market a
bit early, there are not enough deals to go round, and so they cut prices to
buy volume.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (6): How to
beat the swindlers - Car fraud / A look at steps being taken to reform the
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Purchasing a second-hand car can be a risky business. According to HPI, the
vehicle credit information organisation, as many as one in three cars sold
privately may have been written off by an insurance company, reported stolen
or may be subject to a finance agreement. A potential buyer is unlikely to
be aware of any of this.
The fraudulent sale of vehicles still subject to finance agreements is
increasing. According to a survey conducted by the Finance and Leasing
Association, its members reported 9,500 cases of such fraud, which cost them
more than Pounds 45m between February 1993 and February 1994.
The incidence of such fraud has increased over the past few years as more
buyers use a form of financing to purchase cars. According to HPI, more than
55 per cent of all new cars are now bought with the aid of a finance
agreement. Six years ago, that figure was closer to 25 per cent.
Finance and leasing car fraud can be conducted in several ways. Perhaps the
most common swindle is when a car owner sells a vehicle subject to a finance
agreement without informing the buyer.
If the first buyer of the vehicle used a contract hire, contract purchase,
lease purchase, or any other form of lease finance - all of which have
become increasingly popular forms of finance - the new buyer does not
inherit good title and is legally liable for the debt, while the finance
company would be entitled to take remove the vehicle.
If, however, the car was originally bought with a hire purchase agreement
and the second-hand buyer does not know about the financing, the new buyer
is guaranteed some protection under the Hire Purchase Act of 1964.
The act says that innocent buyers of cars subject to hire purchase
agreements receive good title to the car and are not responsible for the
remaining debt on the vehicle. But while the consumer is protected, the
finance company loses out because it is unable to repossess the car or
demand repayment from the new owner.
Frank Layborn, chairman of the working party on aprotection of title
initiative at the FLA, says the 1964 Hire Purchase Act is tantamount to a
'villain's charter' because of this loophole in the law.
He says fraudsters can orchestrate a transaction that is completely
protected by the law. 'You now have the situation where person A, for
example, buys a Ford Mondeo on a hire-purchase agreement. Person B buys
another car. Then they meet in a pub and they exchange the cars without
telling each other about the hire-purchase agreements, and they both get
good title,' he says. 'Neither of the finance companies can collect the
money or their property because both buyers have good title.'
To combat these various forms of fraud, the FLA, supported by the Consumers
Association, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail
Motor Industry and the Driver Vehicle Licensing Association, has proposed a
statutory car ownership register.
All manufacturers and importers would have to register with a centralised
service which would keep track of all subsequent changes in ownership and
finance agreements. It would also store information about insurance
write-offs and keep records of mileage and cars reported stolen.
Each car would be registered by its vehicle identification number (Vin), a
17-digit number allocated at the point of manufacture. Unlike a registration
number, which can change if licence plates are changed, the Vin is set by a
worldwide standard and would remain constant throughout a car's life, making
it difficult for fraudsters to disguise a car's identity.
Anyone buying a used car privately would be legally required to consult the
register to check the vehicle's ownership. Since a finance company owns a
car until the debt is paid off, such a register would immediately reveal any
finance agreements.
The loophole in the 1964 Hire Purchase Act which protects 'innocent' buyers
of cars subject to hire purchase agreements would be eradicated. 'It would
be the buyer's responsibility to take sensible precautions before parting
with their money,' says Mr Layborn. 'So, for example, the two guys in the
pub would not have good title because they would be construed to have
knowledge of the hire purchase agreements under the law. They would be
liable if they did not check the register.'
HPI already provides a register service, but because it is not enshrined in
legislation, Mr Layborn says it is not sacrosanct. 'If a finance company
does not want to register it does not need to,' he said.
HPI is helping the FLA with its legal proposal, and hopes to bid for a
tender to provide the national service.
In the meantime, it collects data for seven registers that 18,000
subscribers in the motor trade and 1,100 in the finance industry use on a
regular basis. The outstanding finance register, for example, contains
details of the finance arrangements on 5m vehicles listed, and the vehicle
identity register provides confirmation of the make, model, colour, engine
size, transmission and fuel type for all vehicles registered with the DVLA
since 1986 - now numbering about 19 1/2 m.
In addition, HPI's services are available to members of the public. For
Pounds 25, a customer can access any of the HPI databases and make sure the
car they intend to purchase is clear of finance agreements. They can also
check that it is not stolen or written off by an insurance company and make
sure the previous owner has not changed registration plates or
misrepresented the car's age.
Consumers who check the HPI register are technically giving up their legal
protection. 'Once you use our service it could be argued that you are no
longer an innocent purchaser,' says Nikki Websper, marketing manager at HPI.
'But you would be daft to buy a car that had an outstanding finance
agreement.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (7): Standard
reforms on the way - Leasing / A look at progress on new accounting
practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most large finance leasing companies in the UK produce excellent accounts
and are a model of corporate reporting in the eyes of standard setters and
the users of financial statements.
The problem for the industry, which it readily acknowledges, is that its
image is still tainted by the memory of failures like Atlantic Computers and
Court Line: the first a lessor and the second a lessee.
These collapses, and the increasing tendency for lessors to be dealers in
assets, often give a jaundiced picture of a vital industry to those in need
of a creative answer to capital problems.
The industry, and the government's own standard setters, are working hard to
improve the integrity of leasing finance. It is worth looking at the case of
Atlantic Computers to see where many of the problems began.
Atlantic was founded in 1975 to provide leasing, lease-financing, broking,
and the sale of computers. It was floated in 1983 and was swallowed by
British &amp; Commonwealth in 1988 for Pounds 408m. Two years later both
collapsed.
Atlantic had reported aggregate pre-tax profits of Pounds 127.6m between
1983 and 1988. When the department of trade and industry finally got their
hands on the books its inspectors were able to report that if prudent
accounting methods had been used no significant profits should have been
reported.
The problem was Atlantic's core product: Flexlease. This product was not
viable in the long term but this was concealed by the way in which the
company accounted for profits and failed to make provisions for contingent
liabilities.
Flexlease was in fact three products: a six-year lease with two options  -
the 'flex' option allowed renegotiation for a new agreement after three
years, while the 'walk' option allowed the client to terminate the lease
after five years.
The options gave rise to large potential liabilities as more customers took
the 'walk' option.
It is this type of 'treadmill' situation which is often the root of the
problem in lessor accounting: where the growth of the business obscures
unprofitability. Once growth diminishes the spiral goes into reverse.
The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) has responded to the type of
problems illustrated by Atlantic, and other failures, by pushing ahead with
reform for lessor accounting, particularly in the area of residual values.
The FLA's focus on residual values is understandable in the light of several
corporate adventures which have ended in failure. However, many outside the
industry would like to see a wider reform, tackling the need for lessors to
give realistic information on profits. The 'treadmill' nature of leasing
finance makes this an area open to abuse.
The FLA does, however, deserve credit for campaigning for reform and
realising that the future of the industry relies on a public perception of
professional integrity.
Both the FLA, and its predecessor the Equipment Leasing Association (ELA),
became aware of the problem during the mid 1980s - particularly in the field
of computer leasing.
The ELA suggested setting up a joint working party with the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in 1986. The institute felt the issue warranted a full
accounting standard and passed the problem on to the Accounting Standards
Committee (ASC).
In 1993, the FLA approached the Accounting Standards Board, which succeeded
the ASC, on the issue. 'They acknowledged that residual value accounting was
a problem area along with other aspects of lessor accounting. They suggested
that the FLA itself should, in consultation with them, draw up a Statement
of Recommended Accounting Practice (Sorp) on lessor accounting issues,'
according to the FLA.
The ASB has allowed the industry to set up a 'Sorp-making' body and it will
meet later this month. Despite some friction between the standard makers and
the FLA the industry will hope that the Sorp will be an influential
accounting standard similar to those introduced in banking and in pension
funds.
The FLA, through the Sorp process, would like to see residual values more
realistically calculated for lessors.
Those values should also be revalued at intervals. The timing of the impact
of revaluation on the balance sheet is another issue to be considered.
Should the company accounts take a single hit or should the impact be spread
over the life of the lease? The Sorp is likely to propose a conservative
compromise between the two.
The FLA disagrees with the ASB when it comes to reforming the standards
governing lessee accounting. David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, says: 'We
take the view that the ASB should be more concerned to ensure that lessors
are properly accounting for their profits rather than with what should be on
or off balance sheet, which seems to be their current preoccupation.'
The ASB's present financial reporting standard is SSAP 21 - the standard set
by the old Accounting Standards Committee, which became effective in 1987.
It drew a distinction between finance leases, which were transactions with
contracts in which the lessee paid most of the value of the asset, and
operating leases, usually over a shorter period.
In the first the asset is treated as a purchase, appearing on the balance
sheet of the lessee, with the profit and loss account incorporating the cost
of borrowing and depreciation. The second item is allowed to remain off
balance sheet. The profit and loss account simply shows a charge for
servicing the lease.
How do you tell the difference between the two? The '90 per cent test'
states that a finance lease was any lease in which the present value was at
least 90 per cent of the asset's fair value.
The result of this rule was, as is so often the case in accounting, the
creation of a small industry dedicated to circumventing it, particularly in
big ticket leasing. Leases were engineered to be off balance sheet at 89 per
cent.
Lessors also abused the spirit of the regulations. In their accounts the
requirements were the inverse of those for the lessee and creative
accounting can remove the impact of the lease on the balance sheet.
Third parties were introduced between the lessor and lessee with the result
that, in some cases, the impact of the transaction was not shown at all.
This state of affairs is unlikely to survive in the face of the ASB's
Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 4, and the ASB's statement of principles.
The first seeks a picture of the true nature of transactions in accounts and
the second defines the true nature of assets and liabilities.
All eyes will be on the ASB in the medium term for reform in this area - and
in the shorter term on the Australian Accounting Research Foundation - which
is currently considering the very same issue.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (8): Koc and Sabanci
adapt to competition and new rules - Business: the two dominant corporate
giants face fresh challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two corporate logos adorn nearly every street corner, shop and office
building in Turkey.
One is the red ram's head emblem of the Koc business empire. The other, the
big white and blue letters SA, the first two letters of the Sabanci name.
These two giants have dominated the Turkish corporate scene for over a
generation, with interests from chocolates to cars to banking to textiles.
Together their annual revenues of Dollars 20.73bn are equivalent to 12 per
cent of Turkey's GDP.
Both face similar challenges as liberalisation and competition intensify.
The principal factors in their success - trade protection, strong political
connections and firm management - no longer apply as they once did.
Both groups were built up by poor men at the dawn of Turkey's
industrialisation 70 years ago and are still controlled by their founding
families. Haci Omer Sabanci began working at 14 and first went into business
in 1932. The Sabanci family remains the group's principal shareholder and
the founder's five sons now run the company.
Vehbi Koc, 94, still comes to the office nearly every day. His company's
headquarters in a converted Ottoman palace controls a far-flung empire with
annual sales of Dollars 14.45bn.
The two became the partners of choice for multinationals setting up business
in Turkey, further broadening their activities, profits and business skills
as they learnt from the foreigners.
Koc's first alliance came in 1928 when it started distributing Ford cars.
Now it makes Ford Escorts and Orions as well as Fiat cars under licence.
Sabanci has joint ventures with the likes of Toyota, Philip Morris and
Belgian steelmaker Bekaert.
These companies are highly profitable: Koc's group pretax earnings rose 55
per cent in dollar terms to Dollars 1.3bn last year. Sabanci advanced far
more slowly, rising 3 per cent to Dollars 633m before tax, giving a 10 per
cent return on revenues. Analysts warn that their complex pattern of
interlocking shareholdings and the vagaries of inflation accounting make it
hard to monitor the groups' true financial situation.
The controlling families realise change is needed. In January, Koc
introduced a flatter management structure, with a headquarters staff of only
200, that granted subsidiaries greater freedom. Eleven divisional presidents
supervise the group's 106 companies, with final responsibility in the hands
of a single CEO, Inan Kirac, a professional manager.
Mr Kutsan Clebican, Koc's finance vice-president, says 'We have very strong
financial controls, but have a general policy of leaving companies alone. We
approve their budget and provide targets and indicate expected inflation and
exchange rates.'
Although top managers are increasingly young, foreign-educated MBAs, these
groups have acquired a civil service atmosphere. Koc executives tend to
spend all their working lives in the company. Very few are recruited from
other companies. It does recruit some senior executives, such as Mr
Clebican, from the top ranks of the finance ministry.
Koc even likes making five-year plans. It abandoned five-year planning this
year because of high inflation, but is back at work on a new one.
Instability is undoubtedly bad for business - car sales have fallen by a
third this year, forcing Koc's Tofas car plant to halt production for six
weeks. Although executives insist that they are not postponing investments,
analysts say capacity expansion at Tofas has been scaled back.
Last year, Koc raised fixed assets and investments 16 per cent to Dollars
1.68bn. But Sabanci's investments dropped nearly a third in dollar terms to
Dollars 385.3m.
Diversification is out of fashion these days. Sabanci claims it is focusing
its business more tightly, but its five core businesses still cover all the
main segments of Turkish industry.
Mr Erol Sabanci, a group director, says: 'The industrial side is diversified
in 50 industrial sectors, so the risks from failure are reduced.' He adds
that even apparently unrelated companies provide synergies: the textile
companies produce cord for the tyre company which supplies the car company.
Despite its wide spread of businesses, Koc gets 75 per cent of its revenues
from cars, white goods and consumer electronics. Executives argue that their
dominant share in these sectors is a crucial defence to growing foreign
competition. Divestment from unrelated companies may come with time.
In the past, protection provided companies with high margins, which allowed
them to fuel expansion with retained earnings, keeping borrowing to a
minimum. However, import protection is declining, so margins must fall.
Furthermore, the capital cost of new investment is rising. Outside financing
will become an increasingly important issue.
Koc is already using the stock exchange to raise capital. Mr Clebican says:
'It is the founder's policy that when a company is financially sound it
should offer shares to the public, because there is not a long future for
family companies. All the money (from share sales) is reinvested in the
companies.'
Koc's Arcelik white goods company and its Tofas car unit are both quoted on
the Istanbul Stock Exchange. It has recently listed two more subsidiaries,
its Bekoteknik consumer electronics arm and Tat, a big tomato processor.
But for the time being, neither group is even thinking of giving up majority
stakes. Most listed companies have just 15-20 per cent of their shares in
the market. Both groups still have plenty of headroom to raise debt. Koc,
for instance has only Dollars 161.7m in long term debt.
The dominance of the two companies is gradually diminishing as new
participants appear on the scene. The Dogus group, for instance, began life
as a civil engineering company. It has metamorphosed into to a banking group
with a growing portfolio of other businesses like food, television,
retailing and tourism. Ayhan Sahenk, aged 65, founded Dogus in 1951 and is
still its chairman.
Last year it reported combined revenues of Dollars 1.38bn, and a net profit
margin of 17.5 per cent.
Mr Zekeriya Yildirim, vice-chairman says Dogus aims to become a
'well-positioned consumer, service-oriented group.' He says this should make
it less vulnerable to business cycles.
Inevitably, Dogus has also adopted a decentralised management structure. Mr
Yildirim says: 'Each subsidiary stands alone, managed by their own corporate
bodies.' The holding company handles strategic planning, financial controls
and head office services. And, like Sabanci, it insists that its financial
and non-financial companies are divided by Chinese walls.
Dogus also insists that what looks like an opportunistic mixed bag of
unrelated businesses is really a balance of inward-looking consumer
businesses and outward-looking tourism and overseas construction companies.
Turkey's giants grew big and strong in a protected environment. They must
learn new skills to prosper in less forgiving conditions. Turkey's chaotic
domestic economy is no help. But there is every sign that these blue chips
will be around for a long time.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (11): Look for
discount at the new 5-stars - Istanbul: signposts for the visitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FINKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may seem a perverse complaint, but older residents of Istanbul moan not
at the proliferation of English in hotel and restaurant hoardings, but at
the fact that foreign words are now spelled correctly.
A disappearing pleasure of Istanbul life is figuring out the names of
establishments from a French transliterated into Turkish. Time was, it was
komilfo (read 'comme il faut') to take tea and pastries in Markiz (read
'Marquise') before spending a night on the town at the Foliberjer (no
prizes).
Nowadays, Istanbul sports any number of orthographically correct
international chains, from McDonalds to the Mvenpick Hotel, designed to lull
the international traveller.
There is some good in all this. The danger of a city with Istanbul's history
and skyline being turned into the proverbial airport lounge remains remote.
The new wave of 5-star hotels and an immediate glut of empty beds means that
the executive traveller at least can hold out for a competitive corporate
discount.
Location, too, is relatively important in a city where the traffic is
designed to ensure you are least 20 minutes late for an appointment. A new
Holiday Inn near the Ataky Marina is not on top of the airport, but near
enough for an early morning flight. The Mvenpick is useful for anyone who
needs to be near the new business district in Maslak on the upper road to
the Bosphorus. The Hotel Merit Antique is in the historic city. Within the
last five years, the Swiss Hotel (best health club), the Ciraan Palace (best
Bosphorus views), the Conrad and the Hyatt (tennis court and good summer
pool) have opened up in the more traditional commercial centre.
The other advantage of the grand hotel is that it provides an acceptable
place to entertain. However anxious you may be for an authentic Turkish
experience, your opposite number would almost certainly prefer to taken to
the new Italian restaurant at the Hyatt or the Japanese restaurant at the
Swiss. The dining-room of the Divan Hotel is still rated for Turkish
cuisine. If you must see a belly dancer, then the Show Orientale at the
Conrad's Manzara is as good a place as any.
Istanbul is desperately short of the good small hotel. However, with a
little bit of nerve you can actually stay somewhere more exotic and still
catch your flight home. Few businessman frequent the Hidiv Kasri (built as
the Egyptian Khalif's summer palace) in Ubuklu on the Asian side of city. It
is, however, very near the exit of the second Bosphorus bridge. This is in
turn makes it convenient both for the TEM peripheral highway to the airport
and the industrial suburbs on the Ankara highway. The building itself is a
model of art noveau, and is set in a remote garden over the Bosphorus. One
day, the hotel's handsome dining-room will get the chef it deserves and be
declared the best small hotel, not exactly in Europe, but just outside.
Another useful alternative is the Kariye Hotel, on the outskirts of the
historic city. This gives it a straightish run to the airport without
traversing the city traffic. It is a good base for someone who has a couple
of hours to set aside for slightly more adventurous sight seeing. It is next
door to St Saviour in Chora, a museum of wonderful Byzantine frescos and
mosaics, as well as a short walk from the highly distinctive Mihrimah mosque
 -built in the 16th century by the architect Sinan for the daughter of
Suleyman the Magnificent. Also nearby are the Theodosian city walls,
including the one section that has not yet been destroyed by the current
programme of restoration.
The Green House (Yesil Konak) is useful for first-time visitors who want to
stay in the shadow of the Blue Mosque. It is run by the Turkish Touring
Club, which has a policy of converting historical properties like the nearby
Aya Sofia Pensions. There are now several private hotels in the same mould.
The Ibrahim Pasha Hotel, on the Hippodrome Square, has small rooms, but a
pleasant family-like atmosphere.
If you've seem the principal sights, then take the walk down past the
classical Sokullu Mehmet Pasha Mosque to the 6th century Church of St
Sergius and Bachus (also called the 'small' Aya Sofia Mosque).
Alternatively, stroll on along the Golden Horn from the wonderfully tiled
Rustem Pasha Mosque to the Spice Market to pick up pistachios (even
reasonably priced caviar) to take home.
A final travel up-date. The Turkish foreign ministry has decided to avenge
itself on all those countries that impose visas for Turkish nationals. Until
recently, British people had to queue for a visa before joining the line to
get their passport stamp. Now they will be joined by Americans and most
Europeans as well.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (10): Pressure on
state bodies - A look at recent changes in commercial law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID TONGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
September saw a significant change in commercial law in Turkey. For the
first time, state institutions and enterprises can have their assets seized
or subjected to attachment, meaning that judgments against them may now be
more easily enforced.
Turkish industrialists argue that, with Turkey's state sector accounting for
33 per cent of manufacturing output, this change will force state
institutions to improve their performance.
Mr Asli Basgoz, senior partner in the Istanbul office of White &amp; Case, a
leading international law firm, welcomes this step forward, as well as the
way that, increasingly, legislation such as that governing the capital
markets is prepared with the help of those who will be affected.
Foreign businessmen say that this was often not the case in the past. They
also warn that legislation, even if subject to frequent change, has often
lagged behind the needs of the market place. Those entering new areas such
as franchising have had to rely on the way that the principle of freedom of
contract is clearly established in Turkish contractual law. But when
specific legislation is required, this often takes time to be introduced, as
is currently the case where financial derivatives are concerned.
Turkish law is codified like continental European law, with commercial and
family law based on the Swiss system, administrative law on the French
system, and criminal law on Mussolini's criminal code. The basic legal
structure is clear, with far more areas codified that in, say, Britain,
where common law applies. Foreign investors are subject to specific
protection under a 1954 law.
The basic legal structures are all in place and on the whole have worn well,
despite the underlying shifts in the economy and the impact of inflation.
'The precedents established in the decisions made in the 37 years since the
commercial code was introduced have played an important role in keeping the
code fresh,' according to Mr Mehmet Okur, partner on Okur &amp; Okur, a Turkish
law practice active with foreign companies.
However, Yased, the foreign investors' association, emphasises the foreign
business community's concern at the lack of protection for intellectual
property. There is no patent protection for pharmaceuticals, and attempts to
introduce a new patent law have been dragging on for over a decade.
Protection of trade marks is slightly improving, but service marks such as a
hotel logo may not be protected. Where copyright is concerned, there has
been progress in combating film and audio piracy, but not over books.
That said, there are grounds for expecting change. Turkey is under pressure
from the European Union, which argues that the customs union due from the
end of 1995 requires Turkey to match European practices. Further, as a
signatory to the Marakkesh accord of the Uruguay Round of Gatt, once Turkey
enters customs union with the EU, it is obliged to observe the Gatt
provisions on intellectual property within one year of their entry into
force. It is also under pressure from the US, which has put Turkey on its
'priority watch list'.
Other areas of concern include:
The fact that you must deliver possession of most movable assets in order to
complete the pledge, which impedes the development of leasing and secured
transactions.
The lack of a registration system for pledges and liens over movable assets.
Limitations of granting mortgages denominated in foreign exchange (which
constitute an important protection for lenders in today's inflationary
environment).
The limited opportunities for cross-examining witnesses in court - the
system is run by judges, rather than adversarial.
However, except over matters of inheritance, Turks are generally less
litigious than people in the US or even Europe. 'Turks believe there are
risks in life and business, and do not rush to blame others,' comments Mr
Basgoz.
Here, an important factor is the limited comfort many people expect from the
legal process. As in many countries, procedures are costly and protracted,
with hearings usually held at three-month intervals, and addressing, step by
step, the issues involved, as Coca-Cola recently found to its cost when it
sought to cancel a bottling agreement.
Turkey has acceded to the New York Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. However, delays often occur in
cross-border cases, particularly when proceedings are required against a
high-profile Turkish national. The administrators of the UK company, Polly
Peck, have found particular problems in exercising the rights given to them
by British courts to act on behalf of the company's shareholders. Lawyers
acting for the fugitive Asil Nadir have argued that such rights would not
have been given under Turkish bankruptcy law.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (9): Toyota plant a
springboard to Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota's gleaming Dollars 400m new car plant outside Istanbul (pictured
above), opened in mid-October, is much more than a prestige private
investment project. It will radically reshape the country's car industry.
As well as raising Turkey's car production capacity by one-third, the new
plant will boost its technological base and, some time in the future, become
an export platform to the surrounding region and Europe.
Closer to home, the new facility will break the virtual duopoly that the
Tofas Fiat-Koc joint venture and Renault have enjoyed for 20 years.
Toyota's timing is unfortunate. Passenger car sales this year will fall by a
third to 234,000, according to DRI World Car Industry Forecast, which does
not expect output to recover to 1993 levels until 1997.
Nonetheless, Toyota's decision to invest in Turkey is an indication of the
market's present and future importance. It is also a sign of confidence in
local suppliers' ability to meet stringent quality standards.
Work on the factory began in 1992 as a joint venture between Toyota and the
Sabanci group. Toyota holds 40 per cent of the company, Mitsui 10 per cent
and Sabanci, together with its Akbank affiliate, the remaining 50 per cent.
Half the investment was funded with equity and the rest with long-term debt.
Toyota's arrival has shaken Tofas out of its complacency. Tofas claims 45
per cent of the local market, but is frequently criticised for its reliance
on old Fiat models. It has hit back with the launch of new Fiat Tipo and
Tempra models only months after their launch in Italy.
But Koc is right to worry about Toyota. According to its annual report, the
car business represents half Koc's group annual turnover and pre-tax profit.
The challenge from Toyota is only the beginning. In 1996, customs union with
the European Union is meant to come into force, exposing Tofas to more
competition.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (6): Investment
bankers' hour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment banking in Turkey is still in its infancy. Capital markets are
primitive. Mergers and acquisition activity is limited, and the scope for
advisers even more so. Treasury operations are unsophisticated, given the
absence of complex financial instruments.
Even so, demand for investment banking services is bound to increase as the
economy, companies and the financial system develop.
Already, banks and brokerages are gearing up for a big fight in investment
banking. Garanti Bankasi, Turkey's most profitable bank, bought into the
investment banking business as far back as 1992 when it acquired Tasarruf
Kredi Bank and renamed it Garanti Investment Bank. This year it moved its
broking arm to the investment bank to further strengthen its presence in the
market.
Dormant mergers-and-acquisitions business may also pick up with the approach
of customs union in 1996 with the European Union. Istanbul bankers think
Europe-based companies will want a greater presence in Turkey, just as local
companies may have to exit competitive sectors.
Initial public offerings are advancing steadily, despite the stock market's
poor health. The trouble is that deals are usually small by international
standards, and many companies avoid using banks altogether. Last year, there
were 18 initial public offerings. There were 13 by October this year, with
flotations varying from under Dollars 2.0m to nearly Dollars 50m.
Privatisation will mark the beginning of megabuck investment banking deals
in Turkey. It may still be a distant prospect, but bankers are confident
that privatisation will generate millions in fees, and transform narrow
capital markets, enabling bigger and more sophisticated deals to follow.
Some of the biggest companies in Turkey - the telephone network and national
electricity utility, for instance - are on the government's privatisation
list.
A bigger local market would prevent even relatively modest deals migrating
offshore, especially to New York's ADR market.
The advent of private funding for infrastructure projects will also require
capital market backing. Although the government has talked for years about
introducing build-operate-transfer rules for projects like dams, roads and
power stations, not a single one has come off the drawing board.
Nonetheless, the bankrupt state will eventually have to cede big-ticket
projects to the private sector. Electricity consumption is growing by 10-12
per cent a year.
BOT deals will probably require a blend of conventional project lending with
more innovative investment banking products.
The downside is that high-tech investment banking is a difficult,
fast-moving business in which even the biggest local participants will be
overshadowed by the New York- and London-based giants. They will have to
scramble for the crumbs when it comes to handling big projects.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (7): A superficial
culture - The stock market has halved in dollar terms this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Istanbul has everything an emerging-market investor could want: exotic
location, loose regulation and boom-bust price shifts. It is not unusual for
average prices to move by 4-5 per cent in a day.
It also has all the usual disadvantages: sharp practices, poor disclosure
and shaky accounting rules. Liquidity is also a problem with daily turnover
of only Dollars 125-160m. Just 10 companies account for over half of
turnover. What goes up also come down with a bang: the market index has
halved in dollar terms this year, after crashing heavily in April.
Turkey's great attraction is the earnings potential of some companies.
Migros, the supermarket chain owned by the Koc conglomerate, had a net 3 per
cent margin on sales last year - roughly six times more than a comparable
company in a mature market. Ciment As, a cement company, had a 1993 net
margin of 29 per cent.
Last year, big private banks lifted earnings by an average 40 per cent,
although profits will fall sharply this year.
The stock market is just nine years old, so it is understandable that Turkey
should have a superficial equity culture.
Mr Albert Nekimken, head of research at brokerage Global Securities, says:
'Even listed companies resist giving information to analysts. They don't
care what the price of their shares is. Companies need education. We are
doing missionary work.'
Although more companies are using the market to raise capital, Istanbul
still cannot handle big flotations. Large companies prefer ADR listings in
the US, both for prestige reasons and because the local market is too
narrow. Brokers hope privatisation will change this, as big state companies
come to the market.
Istanbul should also become more mature as international investors increase
their presence. According to Mr Serhat Gurleyen, head of research at the
broking arm of TEB, an Istanbul bank, foreigners hold about 20-25 per cent
of the market's free float. Only about 17 per cent of the Dollars 21.28bn
market capitalisation is traded, giving foreign participants a mere Dollars
904.4m exposure to Turkey.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange is modernising its operations. Electronic
trading, currently used only for the most liquid companies, will cover all
shares. Settlement and custody will become fully electronic.
It is thinking of introducing a wholesale market. It also wants to link up
with the even newer markets of the former Soviet central Asian republics. It
has applied to the government for offshore status to become a regional
financial centre.
Commissions are deregulated, varying between 0.3-0.7 per cent. There is no
restriction on holdings by foreigners, although they do not have voting
rights. Foreigners pay no tax. Although highly unstable, the lira is fully
convertible. There are no exchange controls.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (5): Good-bye to easy
money - Banking: the credit-rating crisis has exposed the system's weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers are not happy. Most expect profits to fall in real terms, for the
first time in recent memory. Mr Erol Sabanci, vice-chairman of Akbank, part
of the Sabanci business empire and one of Turkey's biggest banks, reckons
1994 pretax income will slide 43 per cent to Dollars 184.2m.
But after years making easy money, bankers are in no position to complain.
They have piled up profits by playing a rudimentary arbitrage game stacked
in their favour.
Banks used Turkey's once-high credit rating to borrow cheaply overseas, and
used the money to speculate in fast-moving financial markets or to lend to
the government. Not only did the government pay high interest rates, it also
allowed the Turkish lira to appreciate, handing banks a 40 per cent margin.
So it is hardly surprising that net profits at Turkey's 10 biggest banks
rose 41 per cent in dollar terms last year, to the equivalent of Dollars
806.2m. Assets rose to Dollars 47.44bn from Dollars 44.33bn.
But the game was up in the spring, when Turkey's credit rating dropped below
investment grade, and currency and financial markets collapsed. Luckily,
only three small banks crashed. But the crisis laid bare the system's
weaknesses: over-reliance on trading, narrow local deposit bases,
unadventurous lending and investment banking arms.
Although bank profits have taken a heavy hit, the government's insatiable
appetite for money is keeping interest rates sky high. In May, interbank
rates reached Latin American heights of 1,000 per cent a year. Even when
rates settled down to 85 per cent in the autumn, they were still equivalent
to a real 40 per cent as inflation fell.
Clearly, banking can still be good business as long as executives are
careful about their risks. Banks with a strong local deposit base have lower
cost of funds and are less exposed to currency risk.
Mr Sabanci says: 'Akbank's main source of funding is local currency. Our
(foreign currency) positions are 10 per cent of liabilities. Compared with
some banks with 90 per cent, this is a tremendous difference.'
He says Akbank's strengths are a sound balance sheet, a healthy loan book
and conservative management. Indeed, even its 33 per cent leap in profit
last year looks hesitant compared with some competitors' gains of 80 per
cent.
The big Turkish banks are impressively manoeuvrable. They have invested in
technology while cutting jobs and branches. They have good, professional
management teams, even though ownership is retained by powerful families.
The big banks exceed international capital standards. Many blue-chip banks
also own big industrial holdings. Depending on one's point of view, these
are either a source of weakness or a source of strength.
Isbank, the largest non-state bank, has stakes in 84 companies, including
control of Sise Cam, Turkey's leading glass manufacturer. Garanti Bankasi,
part of the Dogus industrial conglomerate, also holds stakes in group
companies. Iktisat Bankasi, a highly-regarded medium-sized bank, has
holdings in television, newspapers and manufacturing companies.
Akbank is a minority partner in Sabanci group joint ventures with
multinationals such as Toyota, Philip Morris and Ladbroke's. It has a
leasing company with BNP and Dresdner Bank. These holdings are usually
booked at cost, not market, values. Mr Sabanci argues that these
under-valued equity stakes represent strong hidden reserves. He says that
although Akbank's equity holdings are booked at Dollars 80m, their market
value is now about Dollars 800m.
But analysts complain that banks receive insufficient dividends on these
holdings. Akbank's 1993 gains from participations and investments was just
Dollars 19.5m. But Mr Sabanci says the capital value of these equity stakes
is growing.
Furthermore, ownership of banks such as Akbank or Garanti lies with holding
companies that also own big industrial companies. Problems on the industrial
side could weaken the banking arm and vice versa. Analysts complain that,
while small banks play too fast and loose, big ones play it too safe.
Akbank, they say, should boost profits by being less risk-averse. Garanti
has been slow to develop retail products like consumer finance, credit cards
and unit trusts.
Garanti aims to grow by targeting smaller, more profitable, upscale
segments. Its share of Visa and American Express credit-card operations, for
instance, is bigger than its share of credit cards in circulation.
Some cassandras say banks are less profitable than they seem. Mr Selcuk
Abac, chairman of Istanbul's IBAR bank rating agency, says inflation
overstates profits and is corroding the system's capital base. He says banks
'absolutely need to raise profits and productivity', both to adjust for the
risky operating environment and to rebuild capital.
Whatever the private banking system's shortcomings, they are nothing
compared with the problems of the state-owned banks.
Ms Arzu Turksoy, an analyst at Global Securities, an Istanbul brokerage,
says: 'State banks make inefficient use of their huge assets and have very
poor management. Profit is never considered the first variable. They do not
operate as banks. They make symbolic returns from state sector.'
Their accounts are not audited to international standards. They do not
provision for loans to state enterprises and co-operatives, many of which
should be classified as non-performing.
Even so, nearly all the state banks still perform dreadfully. The four
largest last year raised assets by 4.5 per cent, but net income fell 6 per
cent in dollar terms. In comparison, the six biggest private banks raised
assets 10 per cent and net income 41 per cent.
The state banks' size and inefficiency distorts the banking system, raising
costs for private borrowers. Not everyone complains, though. Mr Erol Aksoy,
Iktisat's owner, says bluntly: 'Spreads are so nice because of the state
banks. With a bit of luck and good management you can make a killing.'
The private banks' fortunes should revive in 1995 if, as expected, the
economy bounces back. However, small banks are perceived as risky and will
probably continue losing depositors to bigger, safer competitors. The large
banks with their lower costs will be the best-positioned to benefit from
recovery.
That said, the day will come when the state will stop lining the pockets of
Turkey's bankers. In other high-inflation countries, stabilisation brings a
big drop in income and a painful transition period as bankers hit the slow
lane of corporate finance and consumer lending.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (5):
Recession takes its toll - Big-ticket leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British 'big ticket' market in financial leasing has been hit hard by
the recession and appears reluctant to recover.
The government's privatisation initiatives have provided vital new business
for the big participants but even here evidence of new growth is patchy.
With 'big ticket' loosely defined as in excess of Pounds 5m it is clear that
few businesses felt able to take on such liabilities during the recession.
In fact, 'big ticket' is often defined as in excess of Pounds 100m - and
rising. Leased assets can now range from an entire production line to a new
power station.
The significant drop in UK investment, particularly in providing for
expanding production with new plant, has been coupled with a restriction in
the tax capacity of the banks. As the banks were the parents of many of the
biggest names in the industry this acted to restrict supply to the market.
The value of the market in the second quarter of 1994 was Pounds 245m,
compared to Pounds 542m in the preceding quarter and Pounds 542m in the same
quarter in 1993. The last quarter of 1993 reached Pounds 805m.
In the 'big ticket' market, particularly, the Finance and Leasing
Association's (FLA) call for this year's budget to reintroduce greater tax
allowances, ideal for new investment in plant, will be welcomed.
But in the short term the sector is flat, but not stagnant. 'At this stage
in the recovery we would expect more big-ticket leasing. There is activity
in some areas - aircraft, power and transport - but there is not the
investment in green field sites that we had hoped to see,' says David
Hardisty of the FLA.
Like many in the industry Mr Hardisty looks to privatisation for growth and
the government's much vaunted but slowly emerging Public Finance Initiative
(PFI).
In fact, the PFI is a repeat of history for the finance and leasing
industry. Lombard Group, one of the leading participants, can trace its
roots back to the North Central Wagon Co founded in 1861 to purchase and
hire railway wagons for the coal-mining industry.
Mr David Hardisty explains: 'Leasing is particularly suitable for privatised
companies which may not be in a position to benefit from tax allowances
themselves.
'Through a leasing arrangement capital allowances are accrued by the lessor
as and when the expenditure on the project is incurred. The benefits of
these are then passed back to the lessee through lease rentals. Leasing is
one of the most efficient ways of using capital allowances. Tax losses can
be turned into immediate benefits.'
Throughout the industry the leading players reflect a picture of
disappointing activity and a search for new forms of financial leasing.
John Brown, founder of NWS Bank, and an executive director, characterises
the market as one flushed with capacity but short on projects with a
resulting tightening of margins for the lessors.
However, he is more than optimistic that the sector will return to growth.
He sees Japanese investment in the car industry in the UK, the privatisation
of British Rail, and new stock for the London Underground as areas of
potential new business.
NatWest Markets is proud of its involvement in a Pounds 290m leasing
facility for Humber Power for gas and electrical plant and machinery.
Despite tough trading conditions it sees new opportunities in evidence:
'Inward investment is particularly encouraging especially from the Far East
and is highlighted by the recent announcement from NEC Corporation and
Samsung in respect of major investments in Scotland and the north-east
respectively.
'The utility sectors remain an important area for the leasing industry as
illustrated by NatWest Markets' recent involvement with Humber Power.'
Peter Graham, joint managing director of Airstream Finances, leases 200
commercial aircraft on six continents. Despite a difficult trading period he
notes that the market is hardening with a 15 per cent rise in rental rates
in the past 12 months.
Hill Samuel Asset Finance, one of the leading participants, has a strategy
of 'added-value' big-ticket transactions and has seen a 'marked increase in
business'. It points to successes in aircraft, ships, shopping centres, and
accommodation for university students as well as financing for more
traditional assets.
'The market place in general is seeing a slow recovery and is in need of an
investment stimulus,' according to Anthony Jukes, managing director. He
notes that it could be 'several years' before investment decisions move into
'spend mode'.
Mr Jukes also notes that the OECD economies in general have now achieved low
inflation with growth in GDP but that there remains concern that fixed asset
investment is still showing little or no growth. 'This trait is particularly
borne out in the UK where despite the low inflation conditions the number of
instances of major new investment have been few and far between.'
Mrs Anna Merrick, head of leasing at Abbey National Treasury Services, says
that in the present interest rate regime margins favour lessees. Recent
successes for Abbey National include part of a new rolling stock order of
Pounds 150m for Network SouthEast.
For John Carr, business director of Royal Bank Leasing, there 'is a huge
potential in the public sector if only the key can be found'. He lists
successful deals in recent months in leasing two Boeing 757s, and
significant contracts with a water company.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (4): More
flexible than overdrafts - Small business finance / A look at asset-based
lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leasing and hire purchase have rarely had a better press. Largely swept away
is the old image of HP companies lending more expensively than the banks.
In its place, asset financing is increasingly being seen as a flexible form
of finance that can be cheaper for small businesses than bank overdraft.
Asset-based finance remains one of the few sources of medium-term finance
for smaller companies and one of the only places that start-up companies can
turn to for funds.
While the image of leasing suffered as the result of a small number of
photocopier supplier agreements, it is arguable that the industry's
reputation has emerged from the recession in more robust shape than that of
the banks.
'There have been stories recently of the banks relaxing their lending
criteria,' says Lesley Kay of the Finance and Leasing Association, which
represents many of the UK's leasaing companies. 'But small businesses which
have had bad experiences with banks feel more comfortable if they can get
finance from a finance house.'
Small companies have also had heavyweight encouragement to seek alternatives
to the overdraft which is still used more frequently to raise finance in the
UK than anywhere else in Europe.
Responding to the debate about small company access to capital, the
chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, and the governor of the Bank of
England, Eddie George, this year encouraged companies to seek alternatives
to overdrafts. To finance short-term assets - such as working capital -
companies might consider factoring, both recommended. For fixed assets, they
suggested companies should look at leasing.
The attraction for small companies is threefold. First, there is certainty.
Assets cannot easily be repossessed by the finance house as long as payments
are maintained. An overdraft, on the other hand can be withdrawn.
Small businesses are also more likely to raise fixed-rate finance rather
than the variable rate of most overdrafts. Finally, hire purchase and
leasing offer a variety of opportunities to use capital allowances in a tax
efficient manner.
The steady growth of financing is evident in the figures. According to the
FLA, its members lent Pounds 13.9bn in the 12 months to August 1994, an
increase of 11 per cent over the same period last year. Of that leasing was
up only 3 per cent to Pounds 7.3bn but it is rapidly being caught by hire
purchase, up 32 per cent at Pounds 6.1bn.
The FLA estimates about a quarter of this by value and much more by volume
is finance for small business and that about 50 per cent of small companies
fund their equipment purchases through hire purchase or leasing.
The rapid rise in hire purchase can be explained by the fact that many
companies have discovered hire purchase is barely more expensive than
finance leasing where the asset reverts to the lessor company at the end of
the lease.
Leasing is particularly attractive to new companies that have no track
record and would have difficulty raising overdrafts. Because finance houses
are as interested in residual values of underlying assets as they are in the
state of the business they are backing, they have a wholly different
approach to banks.
The finance houses have also tended to specialise in certain asset classes;
close asset finance, for example, has developed an understanding of the
value of printing equipment which has made it the first port of call for
companies seeking to set up printing presses.
One beneficiary of leasing's flexibility is Sheffield Omnibus, a start-up
company that wanted to buy 12-year-old second-hand vehicles in 1990. The
banks would not look at assets of that age. But a finance house which was
familiar with the residual value of commercial buses, was able to finance
the deal. Now that the company buys new assets for its expanded fleet it
still chooses to use a finance house rather than the banks.
Finance and hire purchase is attractive for companies with assets with long
lives such as buses. But companies trying to buy computers have less chance
of raising finance. These assets have notoriously short lives, not because
they quickly wear out but because they are rapidly considered obsolete.
Quite simply, a two-year-old computer's market value falls extremely
quickly.
The residual value of such investments is probably something only the
manufacturer will be fully equipped to assess. Such deals will remain the
preserve of financing companies that support equipment suppliers.
For the very smallest unincorporated companies, leasing may also be about to
become a more accessible option. Until now, the UK's small army of
unincorporated companies have been covered by the Consumer Credit Act (CCA)
when they borrow up to Pounds 15,000.
Rather than working in their favour, the FLA estimated this has denied them
access to more than Pounds 100m of finance which finance houses would have
been willing to lend.
The problem is that the Consumer Credit Act weakens a finance company's
ability to repossess assets. If, for example, an unincorporated company had
already repaid a third of the agreed amount when it defaults on its
payments, a finance house would need a court order to repossess the assets.
As a result a number of finance houses simply chose not to risk the costs of
dealing with these companies.
But in June the Office of Fair Trading recommended that business lending
should no longer be covered by the Consumer Credit Act. The department of
trade and industry is studying the recommendation and is expected to
announce its intentions shortly.
If business lending is excluded for the CCA, this would not only boost the
number of prospects for the finance and leasing industry.
It could also provide a much larger population of companies using a more
stable way of financing the main assets in their businesses, reducing their
vulnerability to banks the next time the business cycle turns down.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (2): Short-term
overkill? - The economy: far-reaching reform is proving slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Turkey's economy crashed this spring, the prime minister, Mrs Tansu
Ciller, reacted by concocting a remedy so severe that even the International
Monetary Fund feared she was going too far.
Despite its misgivings, the Fund - after prodding from Turkey's allies in
Washington and other western capitals - quickly agreed to a Dollars 756.2m
standby loan in July.
In her letter of intent, Mrs Ciller promised policies that could only
gladden the IMF's heart: spending controls, a clamp on public sector wage
claims, public sector price increases and restrictions on central bank
lending to the Treasury. The government also imposed a range of one-off
taxes to help close the budget deficit of 12 per cent of GNP.
Ibca, the London-based rating agency, commented: 'The projected tightening
in policy is worth more than 10 per cent of national income over just nine
months. This is one of the most severe fiscal packages ever imposed on an
economy in such a short period of time.'
The government now says it has met its principal targets of lowering
inflation (expected to drop to 20 per cent at annual rate by December),
redressing external imbalances (the current account was Dollars 1.1bn in
surplus by July) and rebuilding central bank reserves (up to Dollars 7bn in
October).
Mr Yaman Toruner, central bank governor, says triumphantly: 'All the IMF
figures are met. We are the best performing country the IMF has ever met.'
However, sceptics are not convinced. One foreign economist says: 'Ciller's
package was comprehensive, but the thing that concerned outsiders was that
they were not very front-loaded. There were too many announcements.'
The key difficulty is dealing with the gaping public sector deficit, the
central cause of Turkey's external imbalance and inflation. The 1995 budget
forecasts a deficit only one-quarter the size of this year's. Few
independent economists think the government will hit this target. No
government since 1980 has ever come near to meeting its budget targets. Ibca
calls this 'a breathtaking record of fiscal incontinence'.
Economists complain that Mrs Ciller has relied on too many one-off tax and
spending measures and is too optimistic in her 1995 tax and growth
assumptions. Furthermore, elections are looming, and she will certainly be
tempted to try and spend her way to victory.
Inflation and interest rates will not fall until the government stops
overspending. Interest charges already consume one-third of the government's
Dollars 38bn annual budget - the same as its wage bill. Mrs Ciller's attempt
last year to drive short term-rates down unilaterally sparked this year's
financial crash. She decided to print money instead of accepting the bond
market's high price for refinancing maturing government debt.
Now, the central bank's tight money policy is keeping real interest rates at
punishingly high levels. In October, real interest rates were as high as 40
per cent a year.
Upbeat as always, Mr Toruner says: 'We want to have a very stable monetary
policy. After (any crisis) it is normal for there to be some fluctuations,
but (with time) these fluctuations will get smaller and smaller.'
Even Mrs Ciller's few structural changes smack of vacillation. She
restricted central bank lending to the government, but not too much. This
year, for instance, the central bank can lend the Treasury the equivalent of
15 per cent of the budget. Lending must fall by three percentage points a
year until ending in 2000. However, Mr Toruner says he is not lending to the
government at the moment.
The government has made little progress in talks with the World Bank, which
it asked in April to support public sector reform. A World Bank official
says the main objective is to 'improve macro-economic management, with
emphasis on privatisation, social security (system reform) and revenues, and
then on project lending to emphasise health, education, urban infrastructure
and supporting transformation of the economy.'
Mrs Ciller is shrinking from reforms that would strike at Turkey's
patronage-driven political system. Mr Osman Birsen, the technocratic
assistant treasury secretary, says frankly: 'Adjustment will require
political determination, and this process has only just started.'
Privatisation has split the cabinet, where partners in the unstable
right-left coalition haggled for months over draft legislation to go before
parliament. However, privatisation looks inevitable, simply because the
state companies' deficits are unsustainable. The only question is whether it
will be carried out by this government or after general elections to be held
by November 1996.
The government may be slow at public sector reform, but it is making good
progress in tax reform. It has reduced tax exemptions, tightened up on
enforcement and reduced corporate tax rates to 25 per cent from 46 per cent.
Next year, for the first time, Turks will be given individual tax numbers
and the tax authority fully computerised.
Much still needs to be done. Turkey's tax burden of 20 per cent of GNP
(excluding social security contributions) is the lowest of any OECD country,
and is even lighter if one allows for the large underground economy. And the
country is moving too slowly to reform the bewildering array of incentives,
loans at negative real interest rates, duty exemptions and subsidies to
business. The World Bank says these supports are indiscriminately accessible
and poorly targeted.
Turkey's economic problems are not overwhelming. It has a flexible,
diversified and energetic private sector. Its fundamental problems are
political: retrograde politicians and their hunger for patronage are
preventing far-reaching reform.

Mr Engin Civan may go down in Turkish history as the man who made
privatisation possible.
Mr Civan, a former state bank president, was shot and wounded in September.
He admitted gangsters were trying to recover a Dollars 5m bribe because he
had been sacked before he could authorise their loan. His tale of
corruption, power politics and organised crime gripped the country for
weeks.
People always suspected state companies were corrupt, inefficient and
politicised. But Mr Civan's revelations accelerated a gradual shift in
public opinion in favour of privatisation.
The state's industrial giants are formidable lossmakers. Last year, they
contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars
29.72bn. Next year, according to the government's optimistic draft budget,
their losses will shrink to Dollars 1bn.
State companies control or dominate the telecommunications, airline, iron
and steel, mining, petroleum and electric power industries. The state owns
the biggest banks. State companies employ 863,000 people, about half of them
surplus to requirements.
The first privatisation programme was announced in 1984. But no government
was ever interested in reducing the public sector. Privatisation has raised
just Dollars 2.2bn in 10 years. Three-quarters came from sales of minority
stakes in private companies. Only Dollars 600m were 'real' privatisations,
mostly in peripheral sectors.
The companies' losses, their inefficiency - water is rationed in Istanbul,
power-cuts are frequent - and the corruption oozing out of them make
privatisation seem only a matter of time.
In January, the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, recruited Tezcan Yaramanci
from the private sector as her new privatisation supremo. He says: 'I
believe today that Turkey has advanced more in the last 10 months than in
the last 10 years.'
But privatisation has split the government. Mrs Ciller's junior coalition
partner, the social democratic SHP party, blocked privatisation until her
DYP party approved a political liberalisation package.
Earlier this year, Mrs Ciller tried to impose privatisation by decree. The
SHP appealed to the constitutional court, which ruled that the government
must win parliamentary approval first. She only won the SHP's grudging
support in October. But even MPs from her own party and the conservative
opposition Motherland party, as well as SHP members, threaten to oppose the
bill.
Mr Yaramanci expected to raise Dollars 2.5bn from privatisation in 1994. His
1995 target is Dollars 9-12bn. He insists he can still raise Dollars 1.5bn
this year: 'From the organisational point of view, privatisation is ready to
go. Right now there are two or three companies ready. International
investment circles have been contacted. There is demand for these
companies.'
However, even economy minister Aykon Dogan considers these targets far too
high.
Etibank and Sumerbank, two small banks, would be first on the block. Fifteen
per cent of privatisation revenues will go to a severance-pay fund for state
company employees who lose their jobs.
Big companies, such as the telephone system or the national airline THY,
would probably find ready buyers. But others will be a very hard sell. The
Erdemir steel works or state banks need lots of costly restructuring.
The government has started tightening controls on its companies. They are
now subject to commercial law. In theory, they can be declared bankrupt.
Tedas, the electricity distributor, is trying to put itself on a
profit-first footing. Mr Mehmet Bozdemir, Tedas general manager, says:
'before, the state came first. Now profit comes first.'
Mr Yaramanci says he will break companies up into individual business units
prior to privatisation. But 'restructuring (for) productivity increases is
left to the private sector after privatisation.'
The proposed regulatory systems looks messy. The government hopes to sell 49
per cent of the telephone company to strategic investors who would hold
management control. The government, using its 51 per cent stake, would
retain a regulatory role. It plans to privatise the electricity generation
industry, but retain a distribution monopoly. This is a recipe for confusion
and conflict, which is unlikely to attract many investors.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (3): Delay will not
hamper trade - Europe: customs union is proving a slow process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long countdown to customs union between Turkey and the European Union is
entering a final, decisive stage. The two have set a deadline of January 1,
1996, to eliminate nearly all trade barriers between them  - 30 years after
talks first began.
Turkey's invasion of Cyprus and its 1980 military coup halted progress.
Return to civilian rule and co-operation in the 1990-1 Gulf War revived
negotiations.
Many obstacles remain. Turkey's parliament is slow in enacting European
legislation, especially competition and intellectual-property laws. Brussels
opposes Turkey's demands for participation in EU decision-making processes.
The European parliament may withhold ratification in protest at Turkey's bad
human rights record.
However, trade seems certain to continue growing. Over half Turkey's exports
go to the EU, which supplies just under half its imports. Turkey is the EU's
tenth largest trade partner. European companies invested Dollars 8.16bn in
Turkey in 1980-83, two-thirds of total foreign direct investment.
Although Europe scrapped trade barriers for Turkish goods 20 years ago -
only agricultural products and textiles suffer significant limitations -
Turkey still levies tariffs on European imports. Its average weighted
protection against EU products is 12.8 per cent, compared with 17.2 per cent
for third countries.
European companies therefore stand to gain most from customs union. A
European Commission official says: 'This is a fast-growing market. About
15-20m Turks have a European-type lifestyle. This is a great market for
European producers.'
He also argues that Turkey will benefit because 'customs unions always
increase trade. There will be more investment, co-operation, joint ventures,
marketing alliances, more research and development.'
Customs union should also close what he calls Turkey's 'very big familiarity
gap' with Europe. He says: 'Turkey feels unloved, unwanted. Political,
social, economic (ties) that come with customs union will have great
impact.'
Many Turkish businesses feel they have little to fear from European
competition, because productivity in many industries - textiles, white
goods, consumer electronics - is already high.
Still, all will feel the pressure from Europe's larger, more sophisticated
and better-run companies. Sectors with the most trade protection will suffer
the most. The car industry, with a hefty 39-106 per cent tariff barrier, is
a prime candidate for opt-out clauses in the customs union negotiations.
Mr Ali Tigrel, ambassador-at-large for European affairs, says he will push
for 'derogation' privileges for certain industries, but will not say which.
Brussels, meanwhile, has already warned that it will limit Turkish access to
its textile market unless Ankara abolishes tariffs and adopts its
competition laws.
Turkey hopes customs union will lead to full EU membership. It has already
applied twice for membership, without success. Mr Tigrel says: 'Customs
union is the cement of the European Union.' Turkey also hopes to unlock
large aid transfers from Brussels, blocked by Greece since it joined the EU.
But even Mr Tigrel recognises that Turkey's 'increasing element of political
uncertainty clouds everything and makes my life more difficult.' However, he
claims that parliament's delay in approving laws is not a critical obstacle
to customs union, as long as it adopts essential competition rules and shows
it is making progress in adopting other laws.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (3): Quiet
revolution in marketing strategy - Motor finance / A look at personal
contract purchase schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quiet revolution is under way in motor financing. In August, around half
the new M cars registered will have been sold through a personal contract
purchase (PCP) scheme - just over two years since the first national plan
was introduced by Ford, the car manufacturer.
Sine then, Ford's Options has been joined by schemes from nearly all car
manufacturers, including Vauxhall Choices 1-2-3, Rover Select and Peugeot
Passport.
The schemes are a return to the old-style leasing schemes, but with a
significant difference: drivers have the option to purchase the vehicle.
Private buyers pay a deposit on a new vehicle, typically anything over a
fifth of the value. The dealer will then calculate the future value of the
car at the end of the payment period, which can be anything from two to five
years. The buyer pays the difference, plus interest, as a monthly payment.
At the end of the period the buyer has two options: to buy the vehicle
outright, for which the outstanding future value sum must be paid; or to
part-exchange the vehicle for another new car. Thus instead of paying the
remaining lump sum to own an older car, the buyer trades it in to pay a
similar amount for a new one.
For the customer this has obvious advantages. It makes a new car more
affordable. Monthly payments are lower than with a straight loan or hire
purchase where the entire cost of the car is repaid over the term of the
agreement. For example, with a PCP, a Rover Metro can be leased for as
little as Pounds 25 a week, after the initial deposit. It also means that
the customer will have a new car every few years. Another bonus is that
often the warranty on the car will mean that many potential repair costs are
covered.
As well as giving the new car market a shot in the arm, PCPs carry other
benefits to the dealers and manufacturers. They promote brand loyalty,
encouraging customers to exchange their used cars for new. The manufacturer
benefits from the regular servicing and repair of the vehicle plus, at the
end of the term, the probability of the customer trading in the old vehicle
for a new one of the same make.
If the customer does decide to hand back the car, the garage is left with a
low mileage - most of PCP schemes limit annual mileage - car, with one owner
and which has been serviced regularly, which can then be sold on.
But PCPs have not suited all buyers. They are unusually available only on
new cars, or sometimes those up to two or three years old. For many buyers,
particularly those who do not have an old car to trade in or a lump sum, it
is not convenient to find a deposit. It may also not be agreeable to pay a
lump sum at the end of the payment period.
Another potential drawback is that agreed future values are covered by a
variety of clauses, particularly those insisting on the good condition of
the car, and mileage limits - usually 6,000 to 12,000 a year. As well as
never owning the vehicle outright, drivers are also tied to the same
manufacturer every time they change models.
However, the overall success and popularity of PCPs is undeniable, to the
extent that banks and building societies are changing their product ranges
to meet the challenge. Yorkshire Bank, which offers car loans with a typical
annual percentage rate (APR) of about 16 per cent, has introduced an
HP-style New Car Finance Plan with typical APR of between 10.7 and 11.6 per
cent for loans of Pounds 3,000 and above.
Midland Bank recently offered its 3m credit card customers Carchoice, in
which they could lease a new car from Swan National - the hire company
bought by the bank last year - for two years and either return it at the end
or buy it outright for an extra fee.
There have been other developments in the motor finance sector underpinning
the PCP revolution. 'The finance houses and the car dealers have finally got
their act together,' says Graham Woodhouse, chief executive of Rover
Finance. 'We are at the point of sale so that customers get not only
first-class sales service but also the best financial assistance as well.'
The result, says Mr Woodhouse, is an improved service and an increase in
sales. 'We have increased the number of sales inquiries into actual sales.'
This has been achieved through a high investment in new technology at
garages. Customers can be informed of terms and conditions for potential
purchases on a variety of options within minutes of an inquiry. Neil
Tomkins, managing director of Lombard Motor Finance, said: 'Those customers
who would have gone to the bank for a loan are now being converted at the
point of sale through better training and new technology.'
The upgrading of the point of sale has occurred while dealers' margins have
declined. With many manufacturers offering cash-back deals on various
models, dealers' margins have been cut from around 18 per cent to 10 per
cent. According to the Finance and Leasing Association, new car motor
finance was up 29 per cent year-on-year for August.
'It's a healthy leap, but the biggest part seems to have happened at the
start of the year, and the indications are that sales growth is slowing,'
said Mr Woodhouse. But he added: 'We do seem to have recovered the feel-good
factor in the industry.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (2): The
trend is still decidedly upwards - Consumer credit / A look at evidence from
the high street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in consumer credit in the past year, which has reflected the
growing confidence in the high street, has not been a smooth one, and the
latest rise in interest rates has further highlighted the fragility of the
recovery.
However, the trend is still decidedly upwards. Figures for 1993 showed how
much the consumer credit market had recovered from the recession, and 1994
has so far built on this.
According to the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), new lending by its
members was up 25 per cent last year at Pounds 13.1bn (1992: Pounds 10.5bn).
The biggest rise was seen in the store instalment sector, where new credit
rose 46 per cent to nearly Pounds 1bn (Pounds 664m). Storecards themselves
showed only a 12 per cent rise to Pounds 3.4bn (Pounds 3.0bn), reflecting
the trend among retailers to offer promotional credit to bolster sales.
There was a steep climb in the number of unsecured personal loans which
jumped 36 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn (Pounds 1.5bn) last year.
Motor finance also staged a good recovery. The FLA figures show a 34 per
cent rise in motor finance credit in 1993, Pounds 5.5bn being taken out by
customers against Pounds 4.1bn in the previous year.
The trends so far in 1994 give a mixed picture of the demand for credit,
although an overall positive one. The April tax increases and the rise in
interest rates in September have both had effects, the first feeding through
slowly to dampen consumer spending and the second raising the cost of credit
with a negative effect on demand.
Inflationary evidence since then, in the rest of the developed world's
economies as well as in the UK, has raised expectations of further rises in
interest rates.
It was just such a fear which was attributed to the slowdown in consumer
credit in August. According to the FLA, consumer credit was up 12 per cent
at Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 2.8bn) year-on-year, and up 44 per cent on the
July's total. However, this latter jump was due to August car sales which
received their annual boost from the impact of new registrations.
The overall consumer credit rise on an annual basis was lower than in
previous months. David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, said: 'The government
underestimated the fear factor and put up rates when confidence was still
too shaky.'
Personal loans slipped 1 per cent to Pounds 256m from the previous month,
although they remained 30 per cent ahead of the year before. Store cards
were also down from July, falling 9 per cent to Pounds 375m, but showing a
58 per cent rise year-on-year.
Infolink, the credit information group, has produced similar findings.
Tracking credit inquiries by its customers, its research showed demand to
finance houses - which provide finance for cars, store cards and 'in-house'
store credit - 18 per cent ahead in July year-on-year, retail 6.7 per cent
up and new car loans 3.6 per cent ahead. These were nearly all less than the
previous month's rises. Brian Bailey, chairman of Infolink, said: 'It is
possible that this reflects a stabilisation in the pace of recovery, rather
than a genuine lack of spending confidence.'
Official statistics are somewhat at odds with industry data - although the
upward trend is similar. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) reported
lending to consumers at record levels in August after a slight dip in July.
On a three-monthly basis, total consumer lending was put at Pounds 1.58bn to
the end of August, up from Pounds 1.15bn in the previous quarter. Higher net
lending by finance houses jumped from Pounds 324m in July to Pounds 486m in
August, according to the CSO.
Underpinning the recovery in consumer spending are changes to the types of
credit being used. Retailers, for example, have been handing over their card
and credit systems to finance houses.
'Retailers are focusing their attention on retaining customer loyalty and
concentrating on what they do best,' said John Morgan, managing director of
Personal Finance at Lombard North Central, the financial services group.
Retailers have also been moving away from option and budget cards in recent
years, opting instead for promotional credit. This might typically offer
consumers not only more frequent sales bargains, but also cheaper credit
with which to buy them. Mr Morgan estimates that as much as 50 per cent of
high street stores' sales are bought on promotional credit.
Many of the high street retailers have farmed out there credit businesses.
In 1989 Storehouse, the BHS, Habitat, Mothercare and Richards retail group,
sold its card business with 400,000 customers, accounting for about 8 per
cent of the group's turnover, to Yorkshire Bank.
Four years ago, GE Capital, the financial services business of General
Electric of the US, paid Pounds 183m for the financial services business of
Burton, the high street clothes group. The deal brought GE a card holder
base of 3m and the management of several other retailer card operations.
GE also took over the credit card operations of The House of Fraser, which
has 1.1m customers. House of Fraser pays GE Capital a fee and the deal is
initially for 15 years. GE also acquired the motor loans business of
Mercantile Credit, a subsidiary of Barclays.
Lombard paid Pounds 100m for Thorn EMI Financial Services and Trinity House
Finance. Store cards and consumer credit business for Thorn EMI's retail
outlets, including Rumbelows, are owned by Lombard, which also looks after
new business for Granada and Visionhire.
'Consumer confidence is returning, although it does seem to be slowing down,
and this is showing through to the credit market,' says Mr Morgan. 'But
people are shopping around and retailers and credit providers are having to
respond.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (1): Consume less,
borrow less - This year's economic crisis may have shaken politicians out of
their complacency and crystallised public opinion in favour of free-market
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARHAM

<TEXT>
This has been a dreadful year for business in Turkey. In March, financial
markets collapsed, the Turkish lira lost over half its value and inflation
topped 100 per cent.
For a few tense days, the entire economy ground to a halt. Shops emptied,
factories stopped working. On one spring weekend, just one car was sold in
the whole of Turkey. After averaging 6 per cent growth since 1990, the
economy is now contracting by 4 per cent.
Yet many executives believe this severe crisis may finally have shaken
politicians out of their complacency and crystallised public opinion in
favour of free-market reforms.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister since June 1993, bears great responsibility
for the mess, for allowing a consumer binge and speculative bubble to run
out of control. The result has been: a 1993 budget deficit of 18 per cent of
GNP and a current account deficit six times larger than the year before.
Confidence evaporated in January when Wall Street rating agencies marked
Turkey's debt below investment grade, the central bank governor resigned and
capital flooded out of the country. By March, Turkey was facing financial
meltdown.
Mrs Ciller adopted a stringent stabilisation package in April to deal with
the immediate crisis. The International Monetary Fund agreed to a two-year
Dollars 756.2m standby loan in July, based on an aggressive programme of
emergency taxes and spending cuts.
The economy minister, Mr Aykon Dogan, now claims total success in meeting
the IMF's targets, especially on deficit-reduction. He says: 'We have
diminished the public sector borrowing requirement to 10 per cent of GNP,
and it will no doubt be further diminished to 7 per cent in 1995. People
said our programme was impossible to apply. But we are serious people.'
The government also asked the World Bank for loans to support public sector
reform that would attack the economy's underlying problems. Six months on,
though, progress is barely noticeable. A weary World Bank staffer summarised
Turkey's problem as 'simply a situation where the government is too big and
revenues too small'.
Turkey must privatise state companies, eliminate subsidies, modernise the
tax and social security systems and sweep away red tape. Determination, or
the lack of it, to pursue public sector reform will shape Turkey's business
environment in the years to come.
Mr Unal Korukcu, chief executive of Ankara's big Isbank warns: 'We face a
tough period for some years. Turks must accept the fact that they must
consume and borrow less.'
Privatisation has split the weak coalition government of Mrs Ciller's
conservative DYP party and the social democratic SHP. Political stalemate is
also delaying negotiations with Brussels over establishing a customs union.
This requires adoption of European legislation, especially on competition
and intellectual property. But these new laws, which would further underpin
reform, are making slow progress in parliament.
Mrs Ciller is a US-trained economist. She knows reform is ultimately
unavoidable and that it would place Turkey on a sound long-term footing,
albeit at the cost of prolonging the current recession.
Yet she is a politician first, the leader of a weak and divided government.
General elections are due by November 1996. Most business leaders - who
dislike and distrust her - expect Mrs Ciller to equivocate and for Turkey's
economic problems to return with redoubled force in 1996.
Still, economists expect the encouraging demand and production trends of
recent months to build into 2-3 per cent growth next year, just enough to
keep up with population growth.
Business executives are confident that public support for structural reform
is approaching critical mass. A sound economy would certainly make
management a less seat-of-the-pants affair and investment would recover.
But banks and companies would lose easy pickings in financial markets. They
would miss the tax system's gaping loopholes and lax enforcement. Import
tariffs are already falling. Intensifying competition, especially after
customs union, will further depress industry's high margins. Companies will
also lose big government contracts and subsidies - although these are mixed
blessings, since debt-ridden Ankara always pays late.
It seems certain that Turkey's handful of conglomerates, which grew so
powerful in the old hothouse economy, will continue to dominate the business
scene. Few others can yet match the financial strength, market share,
political connections and management skills of the pre-eminent Sabanci and
Koc groups.
Yet small and medium companies have grown strongly, able to deliver
intermediate technology goods as well made and well priced as anywhere else
in the developing world. Recession and murderously high interest rates now
threaten these often undercapitalised companies with bankruptcy.
Fortunately, even very small companies can go public. Listings on the
Istanbul market have grown by one-fifth to 169 companies since January 1993.
Turkey's strengths are its typical developing-country characteristics -
rapid economic growth, a large and fast-expanding population, low operating
costs - with the added benefit of some highly sophisticated companies,
proximity to Europe and, if all goes well, customs union with an expanded
European Union.
However, investment is too low. A US observer commented that
under-investment is 'something (companies) have to worry about. They have to
continue improving productivity and sophistication, but it's not happening.'
He says research and development spending in Turkey is equivalent to only
0.5 per cent of GDP.
Instability discourages foreign investment: Turkey has received just Dollars
13.45bn in inward investment since 1980, mostly in the transport, cement and
food processing industries. The underdeveloped legal system, where rulings
can take years to obtain, may further discourage investment as business
becomes more sophisticated and competitive.
Already a large part of the economy has gone underground to escape the
incompetence and over-regulation - as well as the taxes - of officialdom.
The underground economy helps explain why, in a year of such difficulties,
the streets of Istanbul remain choked with traffic instead of protesters.
Professor Osman Altug, of Marmara University, says the unregistered economy
has grown to 41 per cent of GDP from 34 per cent in 1992. Unregulated sales
of consumer goods to smugglers from Russia, eastern Europe and central Asia
alone provide about 200,000 jobs. The textile industry probably has
unregistered exports of about Dollars 3bn a year.
But the informal economy also spawns corruption, loan-sharking and organised
crime. Press reports of connections between gangsters, state companies,
businessmen and senior politicians further reinforce the public's view of
businessmen as flashy Mercedes-driving racketeers.
Disgust at corruption in state companies, their inefficiency - Istanbul ran
out of water this summer - and the heavy financial burden they impose on the
country are changing Turks' traditional view of these companies as the
heritage of Kemal Ataturk and the economy's bedrock.
Yet public sector reform is blocked by fear of unemployment. Mr Dogan
himself says three-quarters of the public sector's 2m employees are not
needed. Mistrust of the business elite is probably another important factor
delaying privatisation. And politicians fiercely resist any measure that
reduces patronage.
The rise of the Islamic Refah party is frequently seen as a reaction against
incompetence and corruption. The business elite and middle classes are
growing further apart from the 40-45m ordinary Turks struggling to survive
on the land or in big city slums.
Polarisation is not just politically dangerous. It is bad for business.
Turkey needs a strong, well-balanced domestic market for companies to grow
and exports to expand.
But Turkey lacks determined leadership. Mr Erol Aksoy, owner of Istanbul's
Iktisat Bankasi, says: 'We need strong governments, not coalition
governments. We need a government (to begin reform) that is at the beginning
of its term not at the end.'
Turkey is still waiting for a successor to Turgut Ozal, the decisive former
prime minister and president who mapped out reform in the 1980s but died
last year.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (1):
Reluctant spenders put brake on growth - While future prospects for the
industry look good, the pace of recovery in consumer credit and asset
finance is still relatively slow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY

<TEXT>
Latest figures from the UK credit and asset finance sectors, traditional
barometers of the economic climate, suggest consumers and business people
are still reluctant to accept that the recession is really over.
In August this year members of the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA)
were owed Pounds 38.2bn for asset finance while in the year to June they had
provided Pounds 15bn of consumer credit. Though the figures are large, the
overall picture is described, nevertheless, as subdued by spokesmen for the
sector when compared with the rapid expansion in the late 1980s. David
Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, admits to a steady rise in consumer credit
but points out, 'we are definitely not seeing another credit boom'.
Many consumers are repaying existing debts, as well as committing themselves
to new credit. On average customers repay the amount owing on a store card
within six weeks.
Moreover, the latest FLA figures for August show the overall growth in
consumer credit slowing up. Borrowing on store cards fell by 9 per cent in
July to Pounds 375m. Personal loans, at Pounds 256m, were down by 1 per cent
month-on-month, though up by 30 per cent on the same month last year.
'Consumers haven't forgotten the last set of interest rate rises. The
government underestimated this fear factor and put up rates when confidence
was still too shaky,' says Mr Hardisty. Nor has the situation been helped by
the government's tax increases which have further militated against a
consumer-led recovery.
In asset finance, the situation is broadly similar. The FLA points out that
while there was a slight recovery in 1993 the figures for total advances
were almost 20 per cent below the peak year of 1990. 'At this stage in the
economic cycle, the business finance figures are frankly disappointing. We
would expect to see much more investment through hire purchase and leasing,'
says Mr Hardisty.
The sector is looking to the forthcoming Budget for help in revitalising the
sector and, coincidentally, to assist the government to achieve its own aim
of promoting an investment-led recovery. The FLA has suggested in its 1994
tax submission that the 40 per cent writing-down allowances on plant and
machinery in operation over the 12 months to October 31, 1993, be
reintroduced as from budget day. The association, and its members, say this
could provide a vital fillip to the industry during an uncertain period.
But while overall recovery may be slow, the industry is developing
increasingly sophisticated forms of finance to support its customers during
the recovery.
In asset finance, a small business can lease a production line which can be
paid for by instalments out of profits. Such devices are designed to
distinguish asset finance from the services offered by banks.
Derek Soper, chairman of AT &amp; T Capital, believes that asset finance has
reached a 'stage of maturity' and must develop new areas of operation to
enable it to grow.
It will, he argues, be difficult for the industry to improve upon its
current performance of financing 30 per cent of all capital equipment
purchases. Growth will come in areas such as operating leases, where the
lessor takes a real risk in the equipment provided, in motor car finance
through contract hire, and through financing privatised industries, such as
the railways.
Another growth area is expected to be so-called 'captives' - finance houses
owned by manufacturers. While some observers point to the negative impact
they can have on the parent balance sheet, because of their higher gearing,
their numbers are growing.
Forward Asset Finance, of the Forward Trust Group, a subsidiary of Midland
Bank, which has provided services to more than 25,000 companies in the past
three years, also sees innovation ahead. Hire purchase, it says, is growing
in popularity, helped by low and fairly stable interest rates.
Improved quality of service is seen as an important development. Forward has
developed 'industry specific' packages backed by trained staff in sectors
such as printing, construction, engineering, and commercial vehicles, and
believes the development of such services to be crucial to retaining
existing business and to finding new customers.
In the high street and in the motor trade speed and convenience, as well as
new approaches are also expected to play an important part in overall
growth. Customers can, for example, be offered low and zero interest
finance, where a finance house provides a loan, and the manufacturer pays
the interest subsidy.
One comparatively recent entrant, Marks &amp; Spencer Financial Services, is now
among the leading participants under the FLA umbrella. The financial
services it now provides have grown from the original charge card base to
personal loans, unit trusts, pensions and life assurance.
In the motor sector, finance made available through UK dealers rose by 13
per cent year on year to Pounds 725m in August. For used cars it was up 33
per cent.
Worldwide, Ford Financial Services, the captive arm of Ford, recorded
leasing advances of Dollars 14.5bn - making it the world's top leasing
company ahead of GE Capital and GMAC (General Motors), according to a survey
by Asset Finance and Leasing Digest.
In 1992 and 1993, point-of-sale credit made the arm the most profitable part
of Ford. Total advances to customers worldwide exceed Pounds 70bn. In 1993,
Ford Credit Europe financed 40 per cent of new Ford vehicles sold in the UK.
In the future leasing and contract hire are seen as likely areas of growth.
Ford Contract Motoring, for example, administers 32,000 vehicles in the UK.
In one recent development, Midland Bank's 3m credit card customers were
offered the opportunity to lease a car for up to two years, and either
return it at the end of the period or buy it.
Finance houses have devised similarly structured deals where customers can
pay off the depreciation on cars rather than the capital sum. (See motor
finance, page 2)
Paul Gee, managing director of Lombard Business Finance, predicts that a
highly competitive market will develop in asset finance where the struggle
to find a clear image and promote service excellence are important. Growth
is expected from projects falling under the government's Private Finance
Initiative, which is intended to take private finance into hospitals,
utilities, and railways.
Management buy-outs have also become a new area of interest to the finance
houses. Pascon, the former BTR plant hire and scaffolding company, acquired
by its management in a Pounds 33.5m transaction, is one example. (see page
6).
In another innovative deal Lombard provided a staged payments plan which, it
said, combined the benefits of term funding with the flexibility of clearing
bank facilities for JP Fruit Distributors. The company needed a 3.5 acre
site at Dartford, south London, for 34 temperature controlled pressure
ripening rooms.
Barclays Mercantile, another leading participant in the market, is using
money from the European Union to promote investment. A European Investment
Bank scheme provided a cash rebate of Pounds 2,300 per new job created, if
the project cost more than Pounds 20,000 and the jobs last five years.
According to Garry Clarke, pricing manager, Barclays used its expertise to
get clients through the machinery of the scheme and speedy access to the
Pounds 12m aid available. Barclays claims a 90 per cent success rate for
clients chasing loans of between Pounds 250 to Pounds 30,000 under an
earlier EIB loan subsidy scheme.
In consumer credit, the entry of new participants, especially from the US,
has created strong new competition in in the European credit card market.
Vauxhall Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, was the first UK car
manufacturer to enter the credit-card market, launching a British version of
the GM card available in the US. Since the GM card was launched in the US in
September 1992, almost 8m people have become card holders.
Such developments have also led to expansion in the list of FLA members  -
from the Automobile Association to Rank Xerox, and to the growth of niche
companies finely attuned to a specific market. Meanwhile, the leading
clearing banks, and the building societies, continue to develop their
finance arms. For all the participants the future offers an expanding market
during recovery in a climate of intense competition and innovation.

FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Racal depressed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Racal Electronics was one of the Mid Cap 250's outstanding casualties, the
shares meeting persistent pressure in the wake of stories of a profits
downgrade by one of the market's leading agency brokers.
James Capel was said to have lowered its current year profits estimate by
Pounds 14m to Pounds 238m. Racal shares, which reached an all-time high of
261p on September 1, have fallen sharply in the past few sessions, and
closed a net 11 lower yesterday at 240p. Turnover of 3.2m was one of the
highest this year.
There were a number of strong performers in the computer services sector,
where Computer People, boosted by a NatWest Securities buy recommendation,
moved forward 17 to 225p.
MR Data Management advanced 13 to 127p after news that it had won a contract
with the Metropolitan Police.
Macro 4 edged up 3 to 438p after SG Warburg Securities, the group's broker,
bought in a further 150,000 shares at 440p apiece via a series of agency
crosses.
Business support services group BET saw 12m shares traded and improved 3 to
114 1/2 p following a strong set of interim results which included a 20 per
cent dividend increase. In spite of the clear two-way pull in the shares it
looked as if most analysts were edging up their profits estimates for the
full year.
ICI was the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 list, the shares retreating 25
1/2 , or 3.2 per cent, to a session's low of 774p after keen selling of the
stock overnight on Wall Street. Dealers said the shares had run out of steam
after last week's interim figures. Turnover was a relatively high 2.7m
shares.
Northern Ireland Electricity was the pick of the electricity sector, the
shares moving up 13 to 377p as the market reacted to the stock's recent
underperformance against the English recs and also to hopes of electricity
sales to the Republic in the wake of the recent peace moves in the province.
Northumbrian Water outpaced the rest of a generally firm waters sector after
broker buy recommendations. Northumbrian shares forged ahead 20 to 726p; the
company is scheduled to announce interim figures a week from today.
Royal Bank of Scotland shares touched their highest level since the end of
February, with dealers citing talk of a chart break-out driving the stock
forward to a close of 457p, up 8 on the session.
Switching from National Westminster Bank and into Barclays cushioned the
decline in the latter and left the former 6 weaker at 503p. Hoare Govett was
said to have been a keen supporter of Lloyds Bank, which held at 572p.
Cater Allen, the discount house, advanced 7 1/2 to 485p, with the market
said to be increasingly optimistic about the interim results expected
shortly.
Bellway's preliminary figures, showing profits up 67 per cent and a 16 per
cent increase in the dividend total, were given a warm reception by the
market and saw the shares race up 14 to 208p.
English China Clays firmed a penny to 360p in the wake of a UBS buy note
citing the group's success in diversification into speciality chemicals, the
strong balance sheet, secure yield and a falling price earnings ratio.

FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers continued to move against the market, adding a penny at 179p for a
three-day advance of more than 8 per cent. The company is due to make a City
presentation to analysts and the suggestion is that it could use the
opportunity either to clear the air over persistent rumours of a link-up
outside the UK or to say something about US demand for Rolls-Royce cars.
Vickers is known to be searching for a joint venture big brother in order to
provide a new 3.5 litre engine for its new, smaller Bentley model. According
to the market, it may have managed to sew up a deal with Daimler-Benz,
Germany's biggest industrial company.
There is also something of a buzz in the air over North American sales of
Roll-Royce cars. The group needs to sell 1,300 of the marque to break-even.
Some analysts have begun to make bullish noises about the company's
operational gearing in this division.
Food retailers sprang to life following top of the range interim profits
from J. Sainsbury which - read in conjunction with Tesco's recent results -
suggested that the stock market's price-war fears could be down-scaled, at
least as far as the sector leaders were concerned.
Sainsbury moved ahead 12 to 411p and Tesco put on a penny at 235 1/2 p. In
active trading, Argyll gained 6 1/2 at 269 1/2 p and Asda firmed a penny to
61 1/2 p. Turnover in Argyll was 8.8m and no less than 16m Asda shares
changed hands as concern over possible loss of market share triggered a
significant two-way pull.
There was some slight disappointment with the interim dividend increase, but
Sainsbury's comments about the resilience of sales in the current six months
led an all-round upgrading of forecasts. BZW is now going for profits of
Pounds 825m, against earlier expectations of Pounds 800m.
Most securities houses were expecting current half sales to be on the flat
side so growth of 1.5 per cent was seen as a clear bonus.

FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burton line on offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shock news that New Look, the fashion retailer, had decided to postpone its
flotation, 'in the light of current market conditions for new issues',
unsettled the rest of the retailing sector and in particular Burton Group.
A poor performance for Burton shares throughout the session was compounded
by the pulling of the New Look issue. Dealers said several blocks of Burton
stock had come on offer during the session, but what really spooked the
market was a story that a block of 10m shares, equivalent to a near 1 per
cent of the company's issued capital, was being offered around the market.
Burton shares dropped to a session's low of 61 1/4 p before stabilising and
closing a net 2 1/2 down at 62 1/2 p. Turnover was 3.1m shares. Burton is
scheduled to announce preliminary figures a week from today, with analysts
expecting pre-tax profits of around Pounds 40m to Pounds 42m, compared with
1993's Pounds 38m.
Kingfisher was another weak spot in the sector, sliding 7 to 465p after two
blocks of 1m apiece were sold into the market at 460p and 461p. Talk of
internal strife at Kingfisher was one of the reasons put forward as behind
the weakness in the stock, as was talk of a Kleinwort Benson sell note.

FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities rally following currency
intervention - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency market developments set the pace for UK equities yesterday, pushing
aside the market's second thoughts on the Bank of England's inflation report
as it weighed the outcome of the regular monthly meeting between the
chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. Share
prices slipped away steadily in the afternoon, but rallied sharply when the
US Federal Reserve stepped in to rescue the dollar.
A fall of 26 points on the FT-SE 100-share Index was cut to 15 at the close
for a final reading of 3,081.3. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index finished 2.3 off at
3,522. The equity market was led by British government bonds, which reacted
sharply to the dollar's performance. Wall Street also recovered an early
fall to edge into plus territory as London closed for the day.
The session opened with the Footsie climbing just above 3,000 as the market
at first extended its favourable response to the Bank of England inflation
report announced late on Tuesday. But the mood had already been damped down
by wider publication of the Bank's hint that UK base rates may still have to
rise over the coming months to keep inflation on target. Equities were soon
unsettled by falls in UK bonds.
Confidence continued to crumble further during the morning, but it was not
until London began to assess prospects for the opening on Wall Street and
its reaction to the dollar's weakness that the blue chip international
stocks turned distinctly downwards.
London analysts doubted whether currency intervention alone would solve the
dollar's problems, and noted that there had been no concerted action
involving European central banks. Some suggested that markets would not
settle down unless the US Federal Reserve took the next step in dollar
support by lifting interest rates. However, such a step would apply pressure
for a similar move in UK base rates.
Oil shares, in spite of this week's good results from British Petroleum and
from the major US companies, slipped lower. The chemicals sector was upset
both by the dollar and by trends in some European chemical stocks.
Pharmaceuticals, also closely influenced by the US dollar and by Wall
Street, closed with minor losses. Good results from BAT Industries failed to
protect the stock against weakness in the US currency.
On the domestic front, views on the implications of the Bank's inflation
report shifted a little after analysts had taken a closer look. Strategists
returned to the perception that base rates would rise either at the end of
this year or the beginning of next, whatever happened in the meantime.
Suggestions that the Bank might want to act sooner were parried with the
comment that it would be difficult to explain an early rate rise in the wake
of the Bank's favourable comments on inflation.
Retail stocks, always the most closely linked to interest rate prospects,
edged higher yesterday but this in part reflected good trading news from J.
Sainsbury, the food supermarket group.
Seaq volume rallied from a slow start but the day's total of 493.6m shares
was below Tuesday's figure. Traders believed that much of the day's business
reflected hurried position switching by marketmakers as the mood turned in
what has become a highly volatile UK stock market.
Customer, or retail, business has remaind fairly satisfactory, and returned
a worth of just above Pounds 1bn on Tuesday. But some analysts point out
that a significant fall in the daily total of bargains transacted implies
that genuine investment business in the UK stock market is being
concentrated in fewer and fewer institutional deals. These deals benefit
securities houses with good lists of institutional clients but leave others
on the sidelines.

FT  03 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures slipped lower for the second day running, moving through
an arc of nearly 50 points in improved trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract stood at 3,097 at the official 4.10pm close
for a decline of 22 points. The premium to the cash market was 14 points and
fair value was around 11 points.
In spite of the day's extensive trading swing - the December contract moved
between a high of 3,118 and a low of 3,071 - activity was again below
average with 12,261 contracts, against 9,600 on Tuesday.
Traders said the quality of business remained weak, with the market nervous
and unsure of direction. Local, or independent, traders set the tone for
much of the session.
There were occasional pockets of arbitrage dealing but the pickings were
clearly very slim. Institutional business was nowhere to be seen.
Volume in the traded options market improved to 28,484 lots, from 22,515 on
Tuesday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounted for just over 17,000
contracts.
There were a number of features among individual stock options. British
Steel saw 2,007 lots traded and Guinness 2,000 contracts. Barclays -
reflecting big switching in the banks sector - British Airways and ICI were
also active.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weaker despite Fed
support for dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
After holding their ground in early trading following successful
intervention by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar, US share prices
tumbled yesterday afternoon as the market resumed its downward path, writes
Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 26.24 lower at 3,837.13.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.92 at 466.50, while the
American SE composite declined 1.34 to 454.18 and the Nasdaq composite eased
0.37 to 771.82. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 333.2m shares.
From the start, the stock market fell in the wake of lower bond prices,
which were pulled down by a weakening dollar. At one point, when the dollar
had dropped to a post-1945 low and the 30-year bond yield was at a 2 1/2
 year high, the Dow dropped by more than 20 points. But equities later
recovered, albeit temporarily, after Fed intervention in the currency
markets wiped out early morning losses in the dollar, helping bond yields
retreat from their earlier highs.
The Fed's intervention was welcomed by investors, who had feared that the
central bank would allow the dollar to keep falling. Apart from the damage a
weak dollar inflicts on the bond market, equity investors feared that a
weakening US currency would make stocks unattractive to foreign buyers.
Later in the afternoon, stocks began to slip lower as the dollar's recovery
faded, and the selling seen earlier in the week resumed. The day's economic
news, meanwhile, had little impact on trading. The Commerce Department
reported no change in its index of leading economic indicators for September
and revised August's figures downward.
The government also reported that factory orders declined 0.2 per cent in
September, a turnround from the 4.7 per cent rise in the previous month, and
the Fed released its Beige Book report on the economy showing continued
expansion in business activity.
Quaker Oats dropped Dollars 7 3/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 in volume of 2.7m shares
on news that the company planned to buy Snapple Beverage, the soft drinks
group, for Dollars 14 a share, or Dollars 1.7bn, in cash. Quaker also said
it would seek buyers for its European pet food and Mexican chocolate
businesses.
The sharp fall in share prices killed recent bid speculation surrounding the
company, while the acquisition indicated a dilution of Quaker's earnings.
Snapple, traded on the Nasdaq market, shed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 13 3/4 in
heavy trading.
Technology stocks were strongly in favour at the start, but fell back with
the market later in the day. IBM ended Dollars  3/8 up at Dollars 74 1/8 ,
Compaq Dollars  1/8 firmer at Dollars 40 5/8 , Digital Equipment Dollars
1/2 ahead at Dollars 30 3/8 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars  1/4 harder at
Dollars 97 5/8 .
Eli Lilly rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 on expectations that the Federal
Trade Commission will announce an agreement today with the company to allow
the drugmaker to purchase PCS, a drugs distributor.
On the Nasdaq market, technology issues performed well. Intel climbed
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 , Microsoft added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63
and Lotus Development appreciated Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/4 . The
exception was Apple Computer, which slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 3/8
.
Canada
A late afternoon rally fizzled out as Canadian stock prices followed New
York to leave the Toronto market sharply down and at its low for the
session.
The TSE 300 composite index was finally 35.47 off at 4,228.98 and declining
issues outpaced advances by 414 to 304 after volume of 60m shares valued at
CDollars 771m.
Overall, 13 of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by real estate, consumer
products, financial services and transportation stocks.
Only the oil and gas sector posted a gain, a modest 0.04 per cent increase.
The golds group receded 1.1 per cent as the New York spot bullion price
eased 10 cents to USDollars 384.45 an ounce.
Venezuela
Equity prices in Caracas fell in thin activity, the Merinvest index losing
1.84 or 1.3 per cent at 142.08 after a drop of 2.2 per cent on Tuesday.
Confusion was reported over rights to a one-for-six, Dollars 65m offer of
shares by the benchmark utility Electricidad de Caracas. Affected by this
the stock fell sharply in midsession, prompting the exchange to suspend
trading while it consulted with the company.
Trading in the stock did not resume. At the moment it was suspended, a
half-hour before the end of the two-hour session, Electricidad was trading
at 305.00 bolivars, down 8.50 bolivars on the day.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The smallest of the world's emerging markets recorded the biggest gains in
the nine months to the end of September, according to data compiled by
Kleiman International, the US-based independent analysts. In local currency
terms Egypt rose by 115 per cent since the start of the year and Ghana by
120 per cent.
However, there was also clear evidence that among the more important and
liquid markets, Latin America had staged a robust recovery from setbacks
earlier in the year. Brazil's performance was boosted by what was seen as
the successful introduction of the last stage in the economic reform process
in July - the switch to a new currency, the real. Since then the Sao Paulo
equity market has retreated, but analysts consider that it is now poised for
a year-end rally. Salomon Brothers said this week that, along with Mexico,
an improvement in the outlook for company earnings and a more promising
political outlook should provide the incentive for a rise in prices.
In contrast Salomon has lowered its asset allocation to Argentine equities
on expectation of higher US interest rates, given that this market is the
most vulnerable in the region to rate moves.
The IFC has launched new stock indices for South Africa, available both in
global and investable versions. The indices are composed of 63 stocks with a
market capitalisation of some Dollars 139bn, or 62 per cent of the stock
market's total capitalisation.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Switch to growth stocks mooted
for Q4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses weakened following the overnight drop in US equities, and
yesterday's Federal Reserve support for the dollar came too late in the day
to engender any recovery, writes Our Markets Staff.
There was change to come, however, said Mr Francois Langlade-Demoyen of CS
First Boston: his scenario was that growth momentum will start to fade in
the fourth quarter of this year, and that cyclicals will lose their charm to
the benefit of growth stocks.
FRANKFURT followed CSFB's inclinations, or appeared to do so, with big gains
in construction stocks and the computer software producer SAP, and falls in
chemicals. The Dax index dropped 27.38 to 2,042.35 on the session, easing a
little further after hours, and turnover more than doubled to DM6.1bn
following Tuesday's holiday in some German cities.
SAP rose DM17 to DM957 and, in construction, Hochtief and Holzmann put on
DM29 at DM968 and DM18 at DM855. At Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, Mr Hans
Peter Wodniok observed that construction shares tend to outperform in late
autumn and winter, provided that sites are not frozen up for months on end.
Among cyclicals, by the end of the afternoon, Bayer was down DM8.60 at
DM341, Hoechst by DM7 at DM321.40, Continental, the tyremaker, by DM7 at
DM213 and MAN, the truckmaker and engineer, by DM11.10 at DM369.90. Here, Mr
Wodniok said that sector performance charts for the German market suggest
periods of outperformance or underperformance lasting between 2 1/2 and 4
1/2 years; chemicals had been outperforming for close to 4 years in the
present cycle, suggesting that this period was coming to an end.
PARIS came back from two days' holiday to a fall of 1.7 per cent following
Friday's 2.6 per cent gain, the drop of 32.09 in the CAC-40 to 1,873.90
reflecting weakness in US currency, bond and equity markets. Turnover was
FFr4.05bn.
However, the bourse found the ability to celebrate a 14.2 per cent rise in
nine-month sales at Peugeot, which added FFr17 at FFr788, and to anticipate
good nine-month results after hours from Roussel Uclaf, the Hoechst
subsidiary, which climbed FFr16 to FFr591.
MILAN turned back as Credito Romagnolo began to erect defences against
Credito Italiano which, last week, bid L2,000bn for a 48 per cent stake in
the Bologna bank. The Comit index dropped 9.89 or 1.6 per cent to 625.54.
Romagnolo fell L654 to L16,295 in early trade before the shares were
suspended as the board announced plans to merge its operations with those of
Casse Emiliano Romagnole, a Bologna-based savings bank.
Mr Bryan Crossley at Hoare Govett said that the move was clearly an attempt
to make Romagnolo 'indigestible'. He noted that Romagnolo and Emiliano had
previously discussed links and said that any such move would make strategic
and commercial sense.
Credito Italiano finished L51 cheaper at L1,589.
Meantime, BCI fell L95 to L3,461 as the board met to discuss future
strategy, prompting further speculation that it might be about to launch a
bid for Ambroveneto. However, analysts were sceptical about any such move in
the short term, pointing to the 34.4 per cent rise in the Ambroveneto share
price between Wednesday of last week and last Monday. Ambroveneto was marked
9.1 per cent lower in early dealings, as investors digested developments at
Romagnolo, before bouncing back to finish L79 higher at L5,315.
ZURICH's SMI index eased 3.9 to 2,500.0. UBS bearers remained at the centre
of attention, giving up SFr11 to SFr1,125 as investors continued to swap
into CS Holding, SFr7 ahead at SFr564.
SBC came under pressure, the bearers losing SFr6 to SFr353 after the bank
reported nine-month figures and warned that it expected significantly lower
full-year results.
Exporters were unsettled by the weak dollar, Nestle losing SFr7 to SFr1,167,
BBC easing SFr20 to SFr1,060, and Ciba giving up SFr6 at SFr721.
Schindler bearers picked up SFr450 or 6.7 per cent to SFr7,200 on the view
that the recent correction had been overdone. One analyst commented that the
stock had seen a number of recent brokers' recommendations; Mr Martin
Ebner's BK Vision was also rumoured to be a buyer.
Oerlikon-Buhrle picked up SFr3.50 to SFr136.50 after the chairman gave a
positive outlook for earnings developments in the coming years at an
analysts' presentation in Zurich.
AMSTERDAM saw the AEX index close 4.50 down at 405.75, and Akzo Nobel lost
Fl 3.40 at Fl 208 although its third-quarter results were in line with most
expectations. Merrill Lynch said the company was on track for good
performance over the next few years and recommended using the recent share
price weakness as an opportunity to buy.
DSM picked up 40 cents to Fl 141.40 after Tuesday's sharp losses which
followed its third-quarter results.
Among companies expected to report today, Philips shed 90 cents to Fl 54.70
and KLM gave up Fl 1.20 at Fl 47.30.
MADRID was dominated by outside influences as the general index retreated
3.06 points to 293.24 in turnover of Pta23.01bn. BCH rose Pta15 to Pta3,015
before disclosing, after hours, a 25 per cent decline in net profits for the
first nine months of 1994.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: (Asia Pacific): Strong yen hits Nikkei
as Taipei rebounds

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The continued strength of the yen hit investor confidence and the Nikkei 225
average lost ground as market participants closed their positions ahead of
today's national holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was off 165.83 at 19,750.65 after a day's high of 19,891.78 and
low of 19,713.94. A decline in the futures market due to Tuesday's fall in
stock and bond prices on Wall Street prompted arbitrage unwinding, while
corporate investors were also seen selling shares. Large-capitalisation
steels and shipbuilders were lower on institutional profit-taking.
The dollar reached a record low of Y96.35 in spite of heavy Bank of Japan
intervention, hurting export-oriented high-technology stocks and car makers.
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of the leading brokerage
company, forecast that the yen could rise further in the long term.
Nomura took the view that the widening of Japan's trade surplus with the US,
due to growth in the global economies and the J-curve effect, could put
further pressure on the yen-dollar rate.
Volume totalled 250m shares, against 247m. The Topix index of all first

Roundup
Wall Street inhibited trading in some Pacific Rim markets, while Kuala
Lumpur, Singapore and Bombay were closed for holidays.
TAIPEI rebounded 2.3 per cent after Tuesday's 5 per cent fall, with rises
led by paper, steel and conglomerate shares. The weighted index gained
141.45 at 6,342.66, off a 6,372.65 day's high, but turnover was a modest
TDollars 57.81bn.
Buying emerged in the last 20 minutes as two new funds, with TDollars 5bn
each, entered the market. Paper stocks led the rally, rising 4.6 per cent on
pulp price increases, with Chung Hwa Pulp up its 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 41.90.
HONG KONG saw selling by foreign investors which left the Hang Seng index
121.64 or 1.3 per cent lower at 9,451.76, in spite of comments by a senior
government adviser that the long awaited Sino-British airport financing pact
would be signed within days.
Blue chips bore the brunt of the selling. Swire Pacific 'A' fell HKDollars
1.25 to HKDollars 56.25, HSBC HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 90 and Cheung Kong 60
cents to HKDollars 36.40.
Hong Kong Telecom, which announced interim results on Tuesday, fell further
on profit-taking, relinquishing 40 cents at HKDollars 15.80.
SYDNEY was lower in light volume, taking its direction from Wall Street. The
All Ordinaries index ended 16.8 down at 2,011.2.
The debut of Acacia Resources, the minerals subsidiary floated off by Shell
Australia, saw strong institutional support, the stock finishing at a
38-cent premium to the ADollars 2.00 issue price.
MANILA was supported by a strong nine-month earnings report from Petron, and
the composite index picked up 22.13 to 3,090.65. The oil refiner jumped 5.9
per cent to a new high of 27.00 pesos.
SEOUL saw profit-taking coupled with Won10bn of sales by the market
stabilisation fund which pulled the composite index 2.69 lower to 1,105.74.
Construction shares lost ground on market talk that the government might
take punitive action against some companies for corruption; the sub-index
shed 11.82 to 569.85.
In a separate situation, Dong-Ah Construction went limit down on reports
that its chairman would be summoned for questioning in connection with the
collapse of a Seoul bridge last month. It fell Won1,300 to Won29,600.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed intervention pulls dollar off post-war
low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Reserve yesterday intervened repeatedly in currency markets
to support the dollar after it touched a post-war low against the yen of
Y96.05, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar recovered on the intervention to trade up to Y97.95 and DM1.5190
in the New York afternoon before ending there at Y97.65 and DM1.5153,
compared with a London close of Y96.205 and DM1.4945, after DM1.4910.
In the absence of concerted intervention, and supportive monetary policy
changes, however, most analysts remained resolutely bearish of the dollar,
with predictions that it will soon fall to DM1.45 and Y95.
Yesterday the Fed was alone in its intervention; in May and June it had the
support of 16 other central banks. The Fed first intervened to support the
dollar on April 29 when it was at Y101.45 and DM1.6590.
Some observers believe there is a good chance of concerted intervention
before the weekend, quite possibly accompanied tomorrow by an increase in
interest rates, after the release of the US payroll figures.
Elsewhere, the main market move came from the lira, which fell to L1,030/DM,
from L1,027. The stronger D-Mark, as the dollar fell, and ongoing political
weakness, were the main factors behind the lira's fall. Sterling had a
steady day, with the trade weighted index finishing at 81.1, from 80.9.
There was no apparent trigger for the dollar's decline, though analysts
cited the violation of the November 1 deadline for a US-Japan agreement on
flat glass, and rumours that the Bank of Japan had stopped intervening to
support the dollar, as souring sentiment.
A further factor supporting the yen has been the better than expected
performance from Japanese corporates in the current results season. This,
said one analyst, lay behind the heavy dollar selling during Japanese
trading, as the realisation set in that the stronger yen was not hurting
Japanese corporates as much as had been predicted.
Short-term money market rates also nudged up in Japan yesterday, and this
provided a further incentive for Japanese investors not to buy the dollar.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said: 'This move
looks like it has Y90 written on it.' He added that there was 'very little'
the authorities could do to stop the dollar's fall as it was fundamentally
based.
The Fed first bought dollars at Y96.10 and DM1.4955, and continued with
waves of buying up to and beyond Y97.75 and DM1.5130. The Fed's move was
supported by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, but analysts agreed that
the dollar needed monetary, rather than verbal, support.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe,
commented: 'I think the market is going to brush this aside unless it sees
the Bundesbank come in. It is not a strong enough signal that the US and
Japan are serious about changing their monetary policy to support the
dollar.'
Mr MacKinnon said: 'This intervention buys time, but it will be unsuccessful
in stopping the dollar's decline.'
Another problem with intervention is that the market is not correctly
positioned for it to succeed. The general view is that the market is roughly
neutral in terms of its Dollars /D-Mark positioning, and still underweight
to the yen.
A key factor in how the Fed proceeds will be the response of US bond and
equity markets. Some analysts believe the Fed is more concerned in the
stability of these markets than protecting the dollar.
A measure of bearishness surrounding the dollar comes from Swiss Bank
Corporation, which is forecasting the dollar at Y90 and DM1.45 a year out.
Furthermore, the bank thinks that the dollar is more likely to reach DM1.25,
than DM1.70, and believes that the risk with its yen forecast is that it
will reach Y90 much sooner.
Analysts said the lira's weakness was attributable more to dollar weakness,
and commensurate D-Mark strength, than Italian factors.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, said
insofar as the lira was weaker than other European currencies, this
reflected ongoing political uncertainty in Italy, and the fact that the
budget had not yet been approved.
He predicted that if the dollar fell to DM1.45, then the lira could go to
L1,040.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn shortage in UK money markets at
established rates. The December short sterling contract closed at 93.52,
from 93.51, and three-month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 1/8 per cent.

<TEXT>
The Jamaican government has divested two of the island's largest banana
farms to Fyffes of the UK and Producers Group, a local company. The
companies, which market all of Jamaica's export bananas, paid USDollars 6m
for a 95 per cent interest in the two farms, with Fyffes being the minority
partner.
The government is expecting improved production of bananas with the
divestment. Mr Seymour Mullings, the agriculture minister, said exports of
the fruit next year should reach 105,000 tonnes, which is the island's quota
to the European Union. This year's exports are projected at 85,000 tonnes.
Meanwhile, the marketing of bananas produced in the Windward Islands is
being restructured with the creation of a new marketing company.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium thrives on phone
connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Booming world-wide demand for mobile telephones has helped the price of
palladium to double in the past year. The precious metal is needed for the
multi-layer ceramic capacitators used in these telephones, as well as in a
wide variety of other electronic equipment such as personal computers and
the new wide-screen televisions.
Yesterday in London palladium reached Dollars 160.35 cents a troy ounce at
one stage, its highest level for five years.
The steady rise over the past 12 months was spurred by genuine demand
because the palladium market was not liquid enough for speculators to take
much interest, said Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland.
Apart from demand from the electronics industry, which was battling to keep
up with soaring sales of mobile telephones, car makers were using much more
palladium in automotive anti-pollution catalysts, where it was being
substituted for more-expensive platinum.
According to Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum group metals
marketing organisation, last year about 4.13m ounces of palladium was
produced. Russia accounted for 2.3m ounces, South Africa 1.4m, while the
rest was provided by North America.
Mr Smith said it was widely assumed in the market that the Russians would
sell heavily from stocks once palladium reached about Dollars 150 an ounce
in order to keep the price down. They feared other metals would be
substituted by the Japanese electronics industry once Dollars 150 was
reached. He said the recent weakening of the US dollar meant that the yen
price of the metal was 'not unbearably high'.
Nevertheless, Russia remained the 'wild card' in the market as it must be
assumed that its stocks were high, given that palladium was mainly used in
Russia for military purposes and military spending there had dropped
dramatically.
Another analyst insisted that there was no substance in rumours that the
Russians were withholding palladium to keep prices rising. There were
shortages of palladium in the prefered form - the powder used by the
electronics and autocatalyst industry - but the market had enough ingot, or
solid, palladium, the only type supplied by Russia.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba struggles to revive sugar
sector - A look at problems dogging the mainstay of the country's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba's sugar harvest, mainstay of the island's economy, could soon begin to
level out after its recent nosedive, but a return to cruising altitude looks
a long way off.
Just five years ago output was running at a comfortable 8m tonnes a year.
But then it went into a tailspin. The crop fell to a historic low of 4m
tonnes in 1993-94 from 4.2m tonnes in 1992-93 and 7m tonnes the previous
year.
This represented lost export earnings over two harvests of Dollars 1bn, a
heavy blow for a sugar-dominated, recession-hit economy whose total export
revenue in 1993 was an estimated Dollars 1.7 bn.
Faced with continuing severe input shortages and a reduced level of
harvestable cane, the best Cuba can hope for from the 1994-95 season is to
slow the decline in its leading export industry. If it can do this, the
island may be able to lay some foundations for a future recovery. But it
will be a hard slog.
Sugar market analysts, such as London trade house ED &amp; F. Man, have already
predicted that Cuban output will continue to fall in 1994-95. Even the Cuban
authorities, normally loath to make any public pre-harvest forecasts, are
signalling that they expect a crop as low as or lower than last year.
'This is not a time for spectacular results measured in large volumes of
sugar,' the official workers' daily Trabajadores said in an October 10
editorial.
'Sugar production suffers from a syndrome of cycles, either good or bad. . .
if you had a bad previous harvest, recovery is difficult,' said Mr Juan
Triana Cordovi, deputy director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on
the Cuban Economy.
It was the sudden collapse after 1990 of crucial Soviet supplies of fuel,
fertiliser, herbicides and spares that knocked Cuban sugar production off
course. Recent harvests have also been buffeted by unseasonal bad weather
and slowed by declining efficiency.
The antidote proposed by Mr Nelson Torres, Cuba's minister for sugar, is a
short, sharp and above all efficient 1994-95 harvest.
This year's campaign, if it starts this month as usual, will not be allowed
to extend beyond April. In another change of strategy, all of Cuba's more
than 150 mills will be required to join the harvest to maximise production.
Last season, more than a dozen below-par mills did not operate, with the
result that their machinery was 'cannibalised' for other uses and their work
forces dispersed.
The over-extended 1993-94 harvest, which lasted well beyond May, cut into
growing cane reserves and delayed field cultivation and mill repairs. Mill
managers, struggling to meet pre-set production targets and to compensate
for industrial breakdowns and inefficiency, harvested cane that could have
been left for the coming season.
Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, said in a September 2
article: 'There is going to be once again - it's no secret - a serious
shortage of cane'. That echoed an August, ED &amp; F. Man report warning that
the protracted 1993-94 campaign, continuing input shortages and reports of
delays in the planting programme meant that 'further degradation of (Cuba's)
sugar production cannot be eliminated'.
As the start of the harvest approaches, sugar workers have been the target
of a blitz of official criticism. State media have accused them of ducking
out of eight-hour work schedules, using poor quality seed and failing to
weed growing cane. 'Why is the cane in such poor state. . . so full of
weeds?' state-run Radio Rebelde asked back in September.
Especially targetted for criticism were the cane growing co-operatives, the
so-called basic units of co-operative production (UBPCs), created in
September, 1993 as part of a decentralising reform of Cuba's state-run
farming system. 'Why have these UBPCs still not been able to contain and
reverse the sharp collapse of the nation's greatest resource?' Mr
Trabajadores said six weeks ago.
Reasons cited for poor productivity in the cane co-operatives were the lack
of incentives, delays in obtaining promised benefits like new housing and
even shortages of work clothes like boots. Government officials were
studying the possibility of introducing greater material incentives for
sugar workers - whether in local or hard currency or in access to consumer
goods - like those already available for workers in Cuba's tourist industry.
To offset harvest manpower shortages, Cuba's official trade union
organisation, the CTC, is preparing to mobilise 61,000 cane cutters across
the island, 25,000 more than last year. This manual cutting force will also
help to compensate for cutbacks in machine harvesting resulting from
shortages of fuel, lubricants and spare parts.
On the commercial front, Cuba has maintained a hermetic silence over the
state of its strategic sugar trade contracts with Russia and China. Traders
in London and New York reported as early as June that the country might have
problems meeting all of its export commitments because of the second
consecutive low harvest. The Cubans were expected to have sought to roll
over many of their commitments into the next crop period, a tactic widely
used even when the island was producing harvests of about 8m tonnes.
The roll-over mechanism is considerably less drastic than the force majeure
declared by Cuba in June, 1993, when torrential rains devastated an already
flagging harvest.

BASE METALS enjoyed another active day at the London Metal Exchange, with
all markets leaping to new highs and mostly absorbing late profit-taking,
traders said.
At the London Commodity Exchange white SUGAR futures registered sharp gains,
buoyed by talk of renewed Chinese buying and expectations of fresh Russian
interest. But COFFEE prices closed sharply lower on trade and commission
house selling and liquidation of long positions. The January contract was
down Dollars 85 at Dollars 3,360 a tonne.

The first commercial oil production by a western joint venture in Ukraine is
to begin later this month.
The Poltava Petroleum Company, a UK-Ukrainian joint venture, yesterday said
it had successfully tested its first well in the Novo-Nikolaevskoye fields
in north eastern Ukraine.
'The preliminary results are very encouraging, well in excess of what had
been expected,' said Mr David Davis, the company's general director in
Poltava, 500km east of Kiev.
JKX Oil and Gas, the UK partner, said the well produced 2,175 barrels of oil
a day and 2m cubic feet of natural gas.
The company believed the three fields that made up Novo-Nikolaevskoye could
hold as much as 60m barrels of oil and 1,100bn cubic feet of gas. Peak daily
production could approach 20,000 barrels of oil and 200m cubic feet of gas,
it said.
Full-scale development of the field would cost about Dollars 53m, and would
mark a small step forward in Ukraine's efforts to wean itself of dependence
on Russian oil imports and exploit natural resources largely undeveloped in
the Soviet era.
The former Soviet republic now depends almost exclusively on Russian oil and
gas supplies - a sensitive issue in often strained Russo-Ukrainian
relations.
JKX, which has so far invested Dollars 15m in Poltava, has a 49 per cent
stake in the project. The rest is split between Ukragasprom, the giant state
oil and gas concern, and Ukraine's State Property Committee, which directs
and oversees foreign investment in state companies.
Ukraine has the option to buy 100 per cent of the oil and gas produced at
world prices. But half of the revenues from domestic sales have to be
converted to Ukrainian coupons.
Mr David Robson, JKX managing director, said the 'forced conversion to
coupons doesn't concern us that much' because the company would have
significant coupon costs during the two and a half years or so that would be
required to drill the 58 wells needed to fully drain the fields.
Any hard currency exports from the development would not be subject to the
forced coupon conversion.
JKX's other Ukrainian venture, the Crimean Petroleum Company, is now
assessing prospects in the Black Sea off the Crimean peninsula. It expected
to begin exploratory drilling late next year, according to Mr Robson.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK apple growers hope to turn
back French tide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of English apple growers has decided to take on the powerful French
Golden Delicious by producing its own, home-grown variety.
'Le Crunch', which has been heavily promoted in Britain and tends to
undercut English varieties on price, has an estimated 20 per cent share of
the market.
But about 24 per cent of consumers feel chauvinistic enough about apples to
avoid buying French varieties, while 57 per cent say they prefer to buy
English apples, according to an opinion poll by Research Surveys of Great
Britain.
So the English Fruit Company, a Kent-based co-operative of 300 growers, has
developed an English Golden Delicious, which is from the same family as the
French variety but has a different cell structure. This makes it sweeter,
smaller and crisper. It is also slightly greener than the yellow French
apple.
'We're trying to develop something which has the edge on flavour,' said Mr
Michael Green, the company's sales director. 'I don't think we'll ever have
the French tonnage per hectare, because we don't have the climate to cope
with that.'
A quarter of a million 40lb cases of the new apples are being promoted by a
superstore chain, Asda, for two weeks this month. If they prove a success,
the fruit growers plan to market the Golden Delicious on a wider scale next
year.
English apple growers complain their traditional varieties, such as the Cox,
are being forced off the market by an influx of apples from low-cost
producers such as Chile and South Africa and from a glut of apples in the
EU.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Four banks handle Portuguese
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A four-bank consortium of Merrill Lynch, Banco Essi (the merchant banking
arm of Espirito Santo, one of Portugal's leading financial groups), UBS and
SG Warburg is to handle the sale of up to 30 per cent of Portugal Telecom,
which is likely to be the biggest global telecoms privatisation of next
year.
The deal will consist of four tranches, each handled by a different bank.
The domestic tranche, which will be listed in Lisbon, will be handled by
Banco Essi; the North America tranche by Merrill Lynch; the UK tranche by SG
Warburg and the rest of the world by UBS.
Between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of the company will be sold in the
initial public offering, which could raise between Dollars 1.2bn and Dollars
1.5bn. This would be Portugal's biggest privatisation and would value the
whole company at between Dollars 4bn and Dollars 5bn.
The offering is likely to take place in the second quarter of next year.
Three international banking consortia were consulted by the Portuguese
government to undertake a valuation of the company, which was formed by the
merger earlier this year of three state-owned telecommunications utilities
and is the country's biggest employer.
Portugal, which has about 34 telephone lines per 100 population, is expected
to open its telephone services to competition by 2003, five years after most
of the European Union.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: Renewed dollar weakness forces Treasuries
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Early declines in US Treasury prices yesterday pushed yields to 2 1/2 -year
highs, but a recovery in the dollar following Federal Reserve intervention
helped the market bounce off its lows. Prices, however, remained firmly
rooted in negative territory.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/32 at 93
9/32 , yielding 8.093 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 3/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.960 per cent.
Early gains following market-neutral economic news were quickly overtaken by
events in the currency markets, where the dollar sank to post-1945 lows
against the Japanese yen.
The renewed weakness in the dollar unnerved bond market investors, who fear
it will deter foreign investors from buying US assets, and contribute to
inflation. At one point, the long bond's decline was sufficient to push the
yield up to 8.11 per cent, its highest level since May 1992.
Prices sprung back later after the Fed intervened in the currency market
wiping out early morning losses. The success of the Fed's actions encouraged
bond investors, who had previously feared the central bank was unwilling to
protect the US currency.
The concern over the dollar overshadowed earlier economic reports. The
Commerce department reported no change in its index of leading economic
indicators for September, and revised its August reading downward to an
increase of 0.5 per cent from the 0.6 per cent figure reported last month.
The government also announced that factory orders declined 0.2 per cent in
September, a sharp turnround from the 4.7 per cent surge in orders reported
for the previous month. Taken together, the data was broadly neutral for
market sentiment.
Later in the day, prices see-sawed, but the mood of the market remained
downbeat. This was partially a reflection of investor nervousness before
tomorrow's all-important October jobs report. The market's concern is that a
stronger than expected report could provoke an immediate interest rate
increase by the Fed.
The US dollar's woes and further declines in Treasuries depressed European
government bonds yesterday. Federal Reserve intervention to support the
dollar on the foreign exchanges prompted a modest bounce, but most markets
closed lower on the day.
'There's no great deal of focus on European fundamentals these days,' said
Mr Ifty Islam, international economist with Merrill Lynch.
'With the US payroll data dominating, the bond markets will still very much
eye the foreign exchange and Treasuries markets.'
German government bonds ended the day nearly  1/2 point lower, but well
above their lows. The December bund future on DTB closed at 88.76, down 0.55
point but off its 88.56 low.
In the morning, prices firmed on a leak pointing to lower than expected
September industrial output data. The official numbers were indeed lower
than forecast, but the data were accompanied by a warning that the rate
could be revised upwards by two percentage points next month, causing the
market to slip back.
Bunds are expected to remain dogged by continuing currency and interest rate
jitters in the US and before next week's new 10-year supply data. Dealers
said many investors were unwilling to build up significant positions as the
end of a difficult year approaches.
Although UK government bonds recouped some of their earlier losses, they
closed about  3/4 point lower. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended
at 100 1/2 , down  23/32 on the day.
Early in the day, gilts slipped on the growing feeling that Tuesday's gains
on the back of the Bank of England's inflation report had been overdone. The
weak US bond market put a further damper on gilts.
Italian bonds were hit by the upheaval in the currency markets, with the
weak dollar pushing the lira to an all-time low against the D-Mark. This
coincided with renewed speculation that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was
about to resign - rumours which were swiftly denied.
However, the fact that currency weakness was enough to spark rumours of Mr
Berlusconi's demise highlights the degree of political unease in Italy,
dealers said.
Swedish bonds fell on disappointment over the government's budget package.
The yield on the 11-year bond rose 11 basis points to 11.20 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: CS First Boston launches
global on-line system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS First Boston was today launching a global on-line electronic trading
system for US government bonds and related securities.
GovTrade, as the system is known, allows investors to buy and sell US
Treasury bills, notes and bonds from the start of European trading to the
close of US trading (18 hours) on a live market that can be accessed through
Bloomberg terminals.
To trade, an investor chooses on the Bloomberg screen an issue in which CS
First Boston makes a price, completes an electronic dealing ticket and
transmits the trade to CS First Boston's government bond traders, who
confirm the trade.
This procedure frees up some of the bank's trading and sales staff, enabling
them to perform tasks other than executing straightforward client orders.
According to Mr Jim Toffey, head of electronic trading for CS First Boston,
the bank processed more than 4,200 trades electronically with its customers
in October alone. However, he says the system will 'complement, rather than
replace' the salespeople by offering speed of execution in a liquid and
fast-moving market.
The system is an expansion of the firm's proprietary GovTrade product which
was launched in September 1992. To date, securities worth Dollars 60bn have
been traded on the system with more than 400 customers in the US, the bank
says. Some 75 investors outside the US are currently viewing the product.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Andalucia makes eurodollar debut as
activity steps up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market saw an acceleration of activity yesterday with a number
of new offerings launched into difficult market conditions.
Comunidad Autonoma de Andalucia, the southern Spanish province, launched its
debut eurodollar issue, with a Dollars 260m offering of bonds due January
2000.
The bonds offered a coupon of 8 per cent and were priced to yield 47 basis
points over US Treasuries, although this spread widened slightly after the
bonds were freed to trade.
Joint lead manager Goldman Sachs reported strong demand from investors in
Asia/Pacific, UK institutions and continental European retail investors, who
were attracted by the relatively high five-year coupon.
Deutsche Bank, the other lead manager, saw strongest demand on its books
from Swiss, German and UK investors, with French banks also showing
interest.
The proceeds from the offering are to be used mainly for infrastructure
financing, Goldman Sachs said. The proceeds were not swapped out of dollars,
market sources said.
At the shorter end of the dollar sector, Hewlett-Packard Finance, another
relatively infrequent borrower, launched a Dollars 250m offering of
three-year bonds priced to yield 25 basis points over US government bonds.
The bonds were sold mainly to retail investors in Germany, Switzerland, and
Belgium and to institutional investors in the UK, lead manager Deutsche Bank
said.
The bank said that the offering was launched partly as a result of the
demand for three-year dollar paper following the launch of a similar
offering by Deutsche Bank Finance last week. The proceeds from the offering
were believed to have been swapped into floating rate dollars, market
sources said.
The pricing spread widened to about 28 basis points after the bonds were
freed to trade. However, Deutsche Bank said that it expected the offering to
follow a similar pattern to that of the Johnson &amp; Johnson three-year issue
launched last week at 15 basis points over but which has since tightened in
price.
Hewlett-Packard Finance last tapped the dollar sector in 1992, Deutsche Bank
said.
In the D-Mark sector, Depfa launched a DM750m offering of five-year bonds
priced to yield 30 basis points over German government bonds. Joint lead
manager UBS said demand from institutional investors was better than
expected, with about two-thirds of the bonds going to European institutions.
Depfa is Germany's largest mortgage bank and 85 per cent of its new loan
business is to the public sector. It has raised about DM15bn since January
and plans to raise a further DM2bn this year, although this is likely to be
in the domestic market rather than the public euromarket, Depfa said. The
proceeds, to be used for general funding purposes, were not swapped out of
D-Marks.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Survey shows explanation is
still needed - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers have been quick to emphasise the importance of properly explaining
their derivative products in the wake of this year's highly publicised
losses by companies in the US and Europe.
A survey of UK companies*, published today, shows that they still have a lot
of work to do in this respect. But it also indicates that companies could
more to help themselves.
Ninety corporate treasurers - all working for companies which make up the
FT-SE Mid 250 index - responded to the fourth annual survey by Record
Treasury Management, a firm of consultants which advises companies on how to
manage currency and other financial risks.
Like previous surveys by Record, this one covers the views of corporate
treasurers on interest rate and currency trends as well as broader economic
developments. But for the first time the survey also includes a section on
derivatives.
It found that although nine out of 10 treasurers use derivatives, more than
half these users believe salesmen are not properly explaining the risks
involved.
Thirty-six per cent of respondents said banks explained derivatives
'inadequately' and a further 18 per cent felt the risks were explained
'poorly'. Only 1 per cent of respondents said sellers were explaining and
quantifying the risks 'very well'.
However, other sections of the survey indicate that corporate treasurers may
not be doing enough to monitor or manage their derivatives risks adequately.
The survey shows two particular weaknesses. First, in spite of continuing
levels of volatility in financial markets, nearly three-quarters of
respondents 'mark to market' the value of their derivatives exposures no
more frequently than once a month.
Only 12 per cent 'mark to market' weekly and 16 per cent on a daily basis.
Mr Les Halpin, chief executive of Record, says that treasurers should 'at
least have the facility to mark to market on a daily basis'.
'Control and monitoring of exposure to derivative risk is essential even
with the less exotic products on the market,' insists Record.
Second, a substantial minority of companies have apparently failed to heed
the lessons of some of this year's corporate losses and continue to operate
corporate treasury departments as 'profit centres'.
Although three-quarters of corporate treasurers rank their main role as one
of 'risk reduction', 9 per cent of respondents believe they can 'add value'.
Mr Halpin believes corporate treasuries aiming to add value have run into
problems because they have taken on risks unrelated to their ordinary
business.
'Nearly one in 10 see themselves as profit centres. That is enough to give
you all the disasters you need for the next 20 years,' he claims.
More generally, there are indications that the management controls and
systems for derivatives may not be in place in some companies. Treasury
departments appear to allocate relatively few resources to derivative
activity, in spite of the fact that it is typically of high value and
importance to the company.
It is 'hard to know what percentage of resources should be devoted,'
concedes Mr Halpin. 'But this is evidently something that needs looking at.'
There are also indications that some treasurers may not be keeping their
boards fully informed about their derivatives activities.
Nearly half the companies surveyed require board level approval for
transactions of Pounds 1m (Dollars 1.58m) and above, but as many as one in
five companies make decisions about derivatives transactions of Pounds 50m
or more without board-level approval.
More generally - and perhaps not surprisingly, given the nature of its own
activities - Record suggests that companies make insufficient use of
specialist advisers. 'Treasurers tend to see derivatives as a do it yourself
business. In other areas of business where specialised expertise is needed
like accounting and the law, companies appoint outside advisers,' explains
Mr Neil Record, chairman.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cathay Pacific puts its future
in Hong Kong - The airline has redesigned its livery to emphasise its Asian
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The twin elements of Cathay Pacific's strategy for beating the recession in
the airline industry came together this week when the Hong Kong-based
carrier unveiled the first of its newly-acquired, long-range Airbus A340s
sporting its new livery.
The redesign of Cathay's corporate identity is meant to shift the airline's
image from that of a British to an Asian airline. The acquisition of the
A340s is intended to allow Cathay to offer a better service by providing
more direct flights - especially in Europe - than it has currently been able
to do.
Cathay's investment in new aircraft - it has orders for Dollars 4bn worth of
Airbus aircraft, produced by a European consortium - and the new corporate
image underlines a third, but less stressed, aspect of the message it wishes
to convey. This is that Cathay, which is currently 52 per cent owned by
Swire Pacific, the UK conglomerate, has a future in Hong Kong after 1997.
'The old livery had been with us for more than 25 years,' says Mr Peter
Sutch, Cathay chairman.
'It was distinctive and had done us proud, but its association is with old
Hong Kong. I don't like to use the word 'colonial', but as with the tail,
which used to carry the Union Jack (flag), the old livery was outdated. We
wanted something that reflected that change: we wanted something Asian in
appearance: we wanted a quality look with an Asian flavour.'
This desire came from the fact that nearly 80 per cent of Cathay's
passengers are Asian. The research Cathay conducted as part of its image
redesign underlined its overwhelmingly Asian customer base, and that it was
not 'catering quite as much as we should to these customers'. Although
Caucasian travellers saw Cathay as an Asian airline, Asians, who perceive
the airline as being well-managed and safe, did not.
Cathay is trying to change that. The airline now offers a wider range of
Asian meals and has begun to communicate in Asian languages. In-flight
information and reading materials are now provided in Japanese, Korean,
Mandarin and Cantonese, as well as English.
Furthermore, as the result of a management reorganisation last year the
airline's four general managers in charge of routes were given greater
authority to alter the services to reflect local taste. Taiwanese
travellers, for example, want to eat real Chinese food and want to buy
duty-free goods on board. Within the constraints of a one-hour flight Cathay
is attempting to meet that need.
Mr Sutch says the airline always thought the Boeing 747-400 would serve its
long-haul aircraft needs, but the recession in the airline industry and
changing consumer tastes altered that. 'Serving smaller airports with the
747 became exceedingly expensive as landing fees and over-flight fees rose,'
he said.
As the airline was flying half-full 747s to Zurich via Rome it found it was
losing out to Swissair and Alitalia which were offering a direct service and
operating the smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11.
'We had a good formula in Asia where we used TriStars on the smaller routes
but 747s on the big routes such as Tokyo and Singapore,' says Mr Sutch.
'We thought a similar approach could be used on long haul. Zurich couldn't
justify a non-stop 747 service - the market is not big enough  - so it
became a choice between the Boeing 777 or the A340. At the end of the day,
while the 777 is a superb aircraft, the economies of a four-engine aircraft
for ultra-long haul are better than those for a two engine aircraft.'
The Airbus had two other advantages. Cathay preferred the seat configuration
to that of the 777. The A340 offers six abreast in business class, rather
than seven abreast for the 777, and eight abreast in economy, rather than
nine abreast. Another compelling factor was 'commonality'.
There are many common features between the A340 and its smaller sister
aircraft the A330, and indeed the even smaller A320. This means that pilots
do not need to spend as much time learning to fly others in the Airbus
family once they have learned to fly one. This is a large cost saving for
airlines and leads to greater pilot productivity as they can be switched
between long- and short-haul routes.
Cathay is probably the only airline which has its future regularly
questioned. The change from UK to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 is something
which leads many to question whether China will allow Cathay to exist in its
present form while being UK-controlled.
Earlier this year Cathay received welcome reassurance of its future when
China Southern Airlines, the Canton-based mainland carrier, withdrew from
discussions to buy Air Hong Kong, a small local air freight carrier. Cathay
was the other bidder and when China Southern withdrew it snapped up 75 per
cent of Air Hong Kong for HKDollars 200m (Dollars 25.88m).
What was interesting about China Southern's withdrawal was Beijing's
intervention. Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong affairs,
personally intervened to prevent China Southern buying Air Hong Kong.
Failure to have done so would have undermined, possibly fatally, the
guarantee to Cathay implicit in Sino-British agreements that it would be the
sole airline for Hong Kong after 1997.
Mr Sutch demurs when asked about the Air Hong Kong talks - in which he
represented Cathay's interests. 'I understand that (China Southern) did not
have the wholehearted support of the authorities in China.
'If that is the case then it was just another reflection of the policy of
the state council, namely, that Hong Kong should be able to develop
independently as it has in the past.'
Inevitably, the firmness of Swire's 52 per cent ownership of Cathay is
questioned. Mr John Godfray, conglomerates analyst at Kleinwort Benson
Securities in Hong Kong, believes that after 1997 Swire may well find it
prudent to trim its stake in the airline to below 50 per cent.
He believes a merger between Cathay and Dragon Air might be the answer. 'It
is logically possible to wrap them up into one group,' he says.
Without commenting directly on Mr Godfray's suggestion, Swire executives
concede that as things develop there may be a need to conduct some
fine-tuning of the Swire shareholding, but nothing dramatic.
'One has to be realistic,' observes one executive.

<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Materials, a leading Japanese metals and ceramics manufacturer,
posted firm profits for the half-year to September due to cost-cutting
efforts and an improvement in its financial balance.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
for the first half rose 26 per cent to Y2.6bn (Dollars 26.8m) on a 0.3 per
cent rise in overall sales to Y344bn. While the company saw an increase in
shipments of aluminium cans due to a sharp rise in demand for soft drinks,
declines in product prices offset the gains.
Operating earnings rose 44.8 per cent to Y8.3bn. However after-tax profits
shrank 4.4 per cent to Y1.1bn due to an extraordinary loss of Y6.4bn
stemming from loan-loss reserves. The company faced earnings declines in
spite of a special profit of Y4.6bn from asset and securities sales.
Sales of metals fell 1.4 per cent to Y122.2bn while cement sales declined
4.6 per cent to Y54.9bn. Sales of aluminium cans rose 8.8 per cent to
Y41.4bn while new materials and silicon sales rose 10.6 per cent to Y34.7bn.
For the year to next March, Mitsubishi Materials expects a 35.6 per cent
rise in current profits to Y3.5bn on a 2.6 per cent rise in sales to Y700bn.

Komatsu, the Japanese maker of construction equipment, posted a 5 per cent
increase in non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items
and tax - for the first six months of fiscal year 1994-95, helped by strong
demand from domestic public works projects.
The company, which is the world's second-largest integrated maker of
construction machinery, increased recurring profits to Y7.4bn (Dollars
76.48m) from a previous Y7bn, in spite of a 3 per cent fall in sales to
Y235.5bn from Y243.1bn. Net profits surged 21 per cent to Y4.3bn from.
Y3.5bn.
Strong demand from public works projects in Japan helped the company
overcome a slump in private-sector orders, Komatsu said. As a result,
domestic sales of construction equipment rose 5 per cent.
However, the weakness of private-sector demand pushed domestic sales of its
industrial machinery division down 38 per cent.
In terms of exports, Komatsu suffered from sluggish demand for construction
machinery in its largest markets in the Middle East, Russia and China, which
aggravated the adverse effects of the yen's sharp appreciation.
Exports of industrial machinery plunged 52 per cent as important customers
among vehicle makers in Europe and Asia cut capital investment
substantially. Komatsu exports mainly body presses for the motor industry.
Komatsu expects the weak conditions in its export markets to continue in the
second half. As a result, it has revised its full-year sales forecast down
to Y500bn from the Y510bn forecast in May.
However, Komatsu is restructuring its operations and expects to be able to
achieve its earlier forecast for recurring profits of Y17bn, while
forecasting net profits unchanged at Y9bn.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: ASX wins legal battle over
new options
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Australian Stock Exchange yesterday won a significant victory in its
battle with the Sydney Futures Exchange over who should run the market for
individual share futures.
A Federal Court judge ruled that the ASX could go ahead with the launch of
low exercise price options (LEPOs). These are designed as very deep 'in the
money' call options, whose exercise price could be as little as 1 cent. The
options' structure means that they should trade directly in line with the
underlying physical stock, but - because of the option market's margin
system - the full price only becomes payable on expiry.
The ASX had proposed launching LEPOs last May, a response to the SFE's
decision to introduce futures contracts on three individual shares - BHP,
News Corporation and National Australia Bank. The SFE was the first to offer
individual share futures, and it has subsequently added four contracts (for
MIM, Western Mining, Westpac, and BTR Nylex).
Hoping to curtail the ASX's rival ambitions, the SFE mounted a legal
challenge to LEPOs, arguing that these were in effect futures contracts and
hence could not be traded on the ASX. Under Australian corporation law,
there is a strict divide between the two exchanges' potential territories:
SFE is restricted to futures trading, while the ASX can only trade
securities.
The SFE's argument centred on the fact that an investor was actually obliged
to exercise the options, through 'economic imperative', and this obligation
made the LEPOs 'eligible commodity agreements' - bringing them within the
definition of futures contracts. In his court ruling yesterday, Mr Justice
Sackville said that it was undeniable that the taker of the option had a
powerful incentive to exercise the option or close it out. But, he added,
'he or she is not bound to do so, in the sense of owing a duty to the writer
of the option or anyone else'.
Accordingly, he dismissed the SFE's claim, and ordered it to pay the ASX's
costs.
The SFE, acknowledging that it was disappointed, said it was taking legal
advice over whether to appeal.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Thai banking sector buoyant
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai banking sector is proving to be robustly profitable in the third
quarter in spite of fears that increased competition and a tougher interest
rate regime could hurt revenues.
Bangkok Bank, the biggest financial institution in south-east Asia, reported
a 31 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits to Bt4.33bn (Dollars 173m).
This proved to be a disappointment for some analysts, however, after Thai
Farmers Bank had earlier reported a net gain of 66 per cent to Bt2.77bn and
Krung Thai a 75 per cent profits increase to Bt2.36bn in the quarter to
end-September.
Bangkok Bank - like most other Thai banks - issues only a bare profits
figure prior to the release of the full audited financial figures. A
spokesman said net profits should rise at least nearly 30 per cent over the
full year to about Bt18bn.
Bangkok Bank's lending growth climbed 12 per cent over the three quarters,
ahead of deposit growth which rose 6.3 per cent, according to the spokesman.
Analysts say there have been three principal reasons for the sector's
buoyant profits - accelerated loan growth, slower-than-expected convergence
of spreads between deposit and lending rates, and declining loan-loss
provisions.

The Czech cabinet approved a Kcs586m (USDollars 21.5m) interest-free loan to
bail out national carrier Ceskoslovenske Aerolinie (CSA), and will wait on
seeking another foreign shareholder, said Vaclav Klaus, prime minister,
Reuter reports from Prague.
'The government agreed to provide, in 1995, interest-free financial help to
the airline in the amount of Kcs586m,' Mr Klaus said.
'(This is) to provide the financial means for paying off the leasing
payments.' The transport ministry said in September that it would seek a
government loan to help relieve CSA from its heavy payment load on its
leased aircraft.
CSA said its outstanding payment obligations for the year totalled Dollars
42.29m for aircraft leased from Boeing of the US and ATR, a Franco-Italian
consortium.

Oerlikon-Buhrle, the Swiss engineering company, expects 1994 group sales to
be between SFr3.6bn (USDollars 2.9m) and SFr3.7bn, including the acquisition
of Leybold of Germany. This compares with SFr2.99bn in 1993, AP-DJ reports
from Zurich.
Mr Hans Widmer, chairman and chief executive, said 'the Leybold acquisition
should boost sales this year'.
Leybold specialises in vacuum technology, which is used to produce compact
discs.
Buhrle has said it expects to post 1994 group net income of SFr65m,
excluding Leybold, up 3.5 per cent from SFr62.8m. Including the acquisition,
however, Mr Widmer said he expected 1994 net income to be even higher,
adding that Leybold expects to report net profit of about DM47m (USDollars
31.3m) this year.

rating to its ADollars 500m (USDollars 370.3m) commercial paper programme,
writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. MEPC has announced plans to diversify its
UK-dominated portfolio through greater investment in the the Australian

Commenting on the move, and associated rating, Moody's said it believed
Australia to be 'the most volatile of MEPC's areas of concentration' and
viewed 'additional exposure as incremental to the company's risk profile'.
However, it added that such risk was 'somewhat mitigated by the company's

First National Bank, the South African banking group, performed strongly in
the year ended September to raise pre-tax income to a record R1.1bn, up 20.9
per cent from R906.3m previously, writes Mark Suzman.
Net interest income rose 13.7 per cent to R2.59bn from R2.28bn, while the
charge for bad and doubtful debts edged up by only 2.2 per cent to R351.3m
from R343.6.
Advances increased by 18.6 per cent to R48.26bn from R40.7bn, while total
assets, which include those of First Bowring and Associates for the first
time, rose 15.3 per cent to R61.76bn, up from R53.6bn.
Group capitalisation is at 9.1 per cent, down from 10 per cent last year but
still well within the 8 per cent limit required by the Banks Act by January
1995.
Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said the results reflected market gains
in both home loans and credit instalment across all divisions. He said he
was optimistic the good results would continue into the next year in spite
of pressure on gross margins from higher interest rates.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Stronger exports lift Amcoal 33%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
An improved export performance helped Amcoal, the coal company in South
Africa's Anglo American group, to report a 33 per cent increase in
attributable earnings to R162.2m (USDollars 46.3m) for the six months to
September, up from R121.8m last year, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Although total sales of coal and coke dropped slightly to 22.51m tonnes from
22.85m tonnes due to lower domestic market sales to Eskom, the state
electricity utility, turnover rose 12.3 per cent to R1.1bn from R944m. The
dividend has been increased to 180 cents from 150 cents.
However, a rise in exports on the strength of the weaker rand/dollar
exchange rate, combined with successful containment of working costs, led to
higher margins, and operating profit increased 33 per cent to R237.4m from
R178.6m.
Mr David Rankin, Amcoal chairman, said he expected earnings for the year to
show a similar improvement to the first half due to improved prices.
However, he warned that two derailments on the railway to Richards Bay, the
port from which exports are shipped, have delayed certain shipments and will
dent export earnings for the second half.

oil, gas prices
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher oil and gas prices helped YPF, Argentina's privatised oil group,
increase net profits 14 per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 181m from
Dollars 159m a year ago.
However, operating profit fell slightly over the same period to Dollars 223m
in the quarter to September 30, from Dollars 228m.
Exploration costs more than doubled to Dollars 122m in the first nine
months, part of the company's ambitious investment plans over the next 10
years.
Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF president and chief executive, said the rise in net
income was due to 'higher crude oil production and prices, higher natural
gas prices and lower asset taxes'. However, increased depreciation and
exploration spending kept operating income flat.
In the first nine months, net revenue from sales slipped 1.3 per cent to
Dollars 2.99bn, partly as a result of 'weather problems' in the second
quarter, but in the third quarter revenue was up by 3.8 per cent to Dollars
1.09bn.
YPF denied local press reports that it had made an oil discovery in Rincon
de los Sauces, in Argentina's central Neuquen basin, but it did confirm that
it was exploring the area.
Mr Christopher Ecclestone of brokers Interacciones said the results were
'good at the bottom line' but that YPF was 'losing position in some areas'
with lower sales of gasoline, diesel and fuel oil. He also pointed out that
bottom-line results were helped by taxes of only Dollars 2m against Dollars
14m a year ago.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Banks seek tighter loan
covenants - Revival in syndicated lending has reawakened old fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many US banks may have breathed a sigh of relief at the warning by Mr Walter
Shipley, chairman and chief executive of Chemical Banking, that he is
prepared to give up Chemical's leadership of the US syndicated loans market
rather than accept looser terms for lending.
European banks will hope that this example becomes the latest development in
syndicated lending to cross the Atlantic.
There were signs last year that the revival of syndicated lending - in which
a loan to a large company is arranged by one or two lead banks, and an
unlimited number of banks contribute to it - was bringing back to banks
familiar dangers.
It has become reality this year, as European banks have followed those in
the US by narrowing margins and slackening loan covenants.
Many banks fear a repeat of the late 1980s, when the driving down of margins
as banks competed for assets was followed by a wave of corporate collapses.
A form of lending that would scarcely have brought an adequate return on
capital for banks, even if every loan had been paid back, became the latest
of a series of collective blunders by the banking industry.
Yet, while banks have been groping for a floor to lending terms,
developments such as the re-entry of smaller Japanese banks since April have
made it elusive.
'One keeps hearing of bank credit committees saying they will not go below
this or that line, but one rapidly hears of a deal that does so,' says Mr
Stanley Hurn, head of loan syndication at Midland Bank.
As banks in first the US and then Europe have re-built capital ratios to
well above the minimum levels set by the 1988 Basle accord, they have been
seeking assets again.
'There is an awful lot of money chasing very few borrowers, and the
imbalance of supply and demand is driving prices down,' says Mr Jonathan
Macdonald, a vice-president of Union Bank of Switzerland.
Some deals are starting to resemble the notorious multi-option facilities
(Mofs) of the late 1980s, which made banks bid to take part when companies
exercised agreed facilities.
'Mofs are so discredited that we will not see them again, but a facility
with a bidding mechanism is a Mof by another name,' says one head of loan
syndication for a European bank.
In theory, syndicated lending ought to be a dying art.
Banks have calculated that they need a margin of at least 80 basis points
(hundredths of a percentage point) over the London interbank offered rate
(Libor) on loans to single-A grade borrowers to make adequate returns. In
practice, margins have fallen this year from about 45 to between 20 and 22
basis points.
Companies were also thought to be shifting towards relying on capital
markets for short- and medium-term finance. But bond market volatility this
year has made many corporate treasurers re-think.
'Margins are at historically low levels, and borrowers can achieve terms
similar to bond markets,' says Mr Peter Nightingale, Chemical's head of
European loan syndication.
However, syndicated lending can be more profitable for banks than it
immediately appears. One reason is that the cost of funds of large banks,
such as the UK clearers, is not in practice Libor. Because of their size and
strength, they can obtain money at about 10 basis points below Libor, which
makes their actual lending margins about one-third higher than their
apparent ones.
A second reason is that banks get fees for lending in addition to the
margin. These range from underwriting fees for banks that syndicate and lead
manage loans, to partic-ipation fees for smaller banks. Many larger banks
try to arrange and lead manage as many loans as possible to obtain fees, and
keep only a tiny proportion of those loans on their balance sheets.
A third reason is that banks still use lending as a means of attracting
other business such as cash management and cheque clearing.
All these factors have led to a big revival in the global syndicated loans
market. There were Dollars 795bn of loans in the global last year, compared
with Dollars 627bn in 1992, according to Euromoney Loanware. About Dollars
497bn was lent in the first nine months of this year, and activity is
expected to intensify.
This has led not only to margins tightening sharply, but banks have also
been willing to lend for longer, locking themselves into low-return assets.
Banks were reluctant to lend for more than three years in the early 1990s,
but facilities such as the recent 10-year, Pounds 100m loan negotiated by
3i, the UK venture capital group, have become increasingly common.
Furthermore, fees are coming under pressure. The standard commitment fee for
undrawn facilities has fallen to 10 basis points or below.
Some bankers report that legal fees charged on standard loans by leading UK
firms have been forced down to about Pounds 10,000 from Pounds 25,000 two
years ago. They also fear that banks will start to wrap fees into the
overall lending margin.
Potentially the most worrying development for banks, however, is the
relaxation of loan covenants. These commonly include financial ratios such
as interest cover, gearing and the minimum net worth of the borrower.
It is the willingness of some banks to accept deals with loose covenants -
and some deals with none - that has particularly worried Mr Shipley.
Some bankers argue that covenants are not significant because European
credit quality is improving, and covenants did not prevent the last wave of
corporate defaults. Yet given the ability of a single corporate collapse to
eliminate the slim return on assets in a bank's syndicated lending
activities, others regard the protection of covenants as vital.
Mr Shipley's warning may be a first step to restoring equilibrium for other
banks. But the protection of loan covenants will require senior directors of
banks to back the judgment of internal credit committees against those of
executives who market loans.
Without such tough measures, many bankers fear that history will repeat
itself uncomfortably quickly.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: US groups in Internet commerce
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tandem Computers of the US has reached a preliminary agreement to
collaborate with Open Market, a software company, in the emerging market for
electronic commerce on the Internet, a global computer information network.
Tandem sees electronic commerce as a significant new market opportunity.
Open Market, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has developed software that
enables companies to establish and manage on-line shopping services.
Electronic commerce is expected to reduce substantially the paperwork
involved in corporate purchasing - currently estimated at more than 2.7bn
pages daily. It also offers new ways to reach mass markets of consumers.
The Internet has more than 25m users and is estimated to be growing at a
rate of two to three million new users a month.
On-line shopping will generate about Dollars 4.8bn a year by 1998, predicts
Forrester Research, a US market research company.
Growth will be driven by the proliferation of home computers and by
improvements in on-line product presentation, it says.
Also boosting growth is the expanding use of commercial on-line computer
information and communications services such as Prodigy, America Online and
Compuserve. At the end of 1993 these services had about 3.9m subscribers.
The number is expected to reach about 5.2m by the end of this year,
according to market researchers.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: US hospital group rises on
improved margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Columbia/HCA, the US's biggest hospital group, recorded a 14 per cent
increase in operating earnings in the three months to the end of September
on the back of a jump in out-patient services.
The company's operating profit margin improved to 18.6 per cent, from 17.9
per cent a year ago, said Mr David Vandewater, chief operating officer.
Columbia/HCA has pulled off a string of multi-billion dollar acquisitions in
the past 18 months in an attempt to bolster its market position and
strengthen profit margins at a time when healthcare companies across the US
are under pressure to reduce their prices.
The third-quarter figures reflect a 2 per cent increase in admissions at
hospitals which the company had owned a year before, and a 52 per cent
increase in out-patient visits.
While hospital stays are declining overall in the US, Columbia/HCA has
advanced in part by buying new hospitals in the same areas as its existing
facilities and then shifting patients between sites to boost admission
rates.
Operating profits for the period were Dollars 507m, up 14 per cent on a year
ago, while total revenues were Dollars 2.7bn, up 9.5 per cent.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 153m, or 44 cents a share, after a
Dollars 23m charge for the early retirement of debt. The company reported an
after-tax loss of Dollars 56m, or 16 cents a share, in the 1993 period after
Dollars 193m of one-off charges.
The latest figures include some contribution from Medical Care America, an
acquisition of which was completed during September, but do not include
HealthTrust, which Columbia/HCA agreed to acquire after the end of the third
quarter.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tenneco to offer more shares in
Case unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, is to issue 15.6m more shares
of its JI Case farm and construction equipment unit in a deal that will
reduce Tenneco's holding in the company to less than 50 per cent.
The share sale, which follows an initial public offering of Case's shares
last June, is expected to net Tenneco about Dollars 320m, as well as Dollars
150m in cash benefits related to taxes.
In the June offering, Tenneco sold 29 per cent of Case to the public at
Dollars 19 a share, raising more than Dollars 380m. Case shares closed
Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 20 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The offering puts Tenneco in a race to reinvest the proceeds from the Case
sales in a way that will replace Case's contributions to earnings.
The second-largest farm equipment maker in the US, and the world's largest
manufacturer and distributor of light and medium-sized construction
machinery, Case had sales of nearly Dollars 4bn last year.
During the fourth quarter, Case contributed Dollars 73m, or almost 20 per
cent, of Tenneco's Dollars 363m operating income.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Poor returns from US purchases,
study says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign companies have suffered poor and declining returns on their US
acquisitions in recent years, but could see a rebound in overall
profitability in the near future, according to a study by two economists at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The two, Mr David Laster and Mr Robert McCauley, note that foreigners have
paid Dollars 316bn to buy US companies over the past decade, but lost money
overall on their holdings in 1992 - a year of record profits for US-owned
companies.
The performance, the authors say, 'strikes many as unbelievable'.
They attribute the results to the tendency of foreign companies to buy
poorly-performing US businesses, and to attempt to rebuild them through
fresh investment. 'These companies paid top dollar for underperforming US
firms, borrowed heavily, and then spent freely on investment and marketing,'
the authors say.
The overall poor performance of foreign-owned firms in 1992 also reflects
the heavy level of purchases in recent years, with many of the businesses
still in the early phases of planned turnrounds.
With fewer purchases now, and with some foreigners shedding their
loss-making US companies, overall profitability will rise in the coming
years, according to the Fed study.
UK companies were the biggest foreign investors in the US last year, and
this year should see their total US investments overhaul those of Japanese
companies, according to a study of foreign direct investment by Arthur
Andersen.
The accounting firm puts investment by UK firms either in acquisitions or
creation and expansion of businesses at Dollars 9.03bn last year, four times
the level of 1992. Japanese companies invested Dollars 1.8bn, down from
Dollars 2.9bn the year before.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Renault in strong demand as
share-sale lists open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The partial privatisation of Renault, the French vehicles group, opens today
with institutions demanding 12 times more shares than they have been
allocated, the government indicated yesterday.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economics minister, said on French television last
night that the bookbuilding process currently under way for the 62m shares
to be placed on the market had proved highly successful and showed what
'excellent value' the shares represented.
Under the terms of the sale, individual investors will be able to buy up to
60 per cent of the shares to be quoted at FFr165 each, while institutions
will take the remainder at FFr176 a share.
Both prices are towards the lower end of the range of estimates discussed in
the last few weeks, and value the group at about FFr40bn (Dollars 7.8bn).
The government will reduce its stake from 79 per cent to about 51 per cent,
and Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an abortive merger last
year, will divest the 8 per cent minimum agreed with the French state, from
its current holding of 20 per cent. The exercise will increase Renault's
capital by FFr2bn.
The bookbuilding process among institutions finishes today, and individual
investors will be able to apply for shares until November 10.
Slightly more than 6m shares have been reserved for current and former
Renault employees, who will be able to gain free bonus shares in proportion
to the number they buy.
Mr Alphandery said he was confident of the success of the sale, and said the
price was fair - particularly given that Renault was one of the few European
car manufacturers to make a profit last year.
In an interview today in Les Echos, a French business newspaper, Mr Louis
Schweitzer, Renault's chief executive, says that he sees no reason why the
partial flotation should delay full privatisation. His comments are in
contrast to earlier assurances from Mr Alphandery that the government had no
plans to push for further flotation.
Volvo had the option of selling a further 4 per cent of its shares at the
price available to institutions, but decided not to do so. 'In our
estimation there is scope for a future value increase in Renault,' Mr Soren
Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said yesterday.
The government confirmed the four 'shareholder partners' which will share 5
per cent of the enlarged capital: Sogepaf (part of Elf Aquitaine), Lagardere
Group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc Finance.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Conseco cuts value of Kemper bid
to Dollars 2.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Kemper, the US financial services group, was thrown into doubt
yesterday as Conseco, the Indiana-based insurer, reduced the value of its
bid for the company.
The move could open the way for a renewed takeover approach from GE Capital,
the financial services arm of General Electric, or another buyer.
The new, lower offer, which values Kemper at Dollars 2.4bn, has been made
because the original offer probably would not win the support of Conseco's
shareholders, said Mr Stephen Hilbert, Conseco's chairman and chief
executive.
Many shareholders are believed to be unhappy that a fall in Conseco's share
price since June, when the original offer was made, would leave Kemper
shareholders with a far bigger proportion of the enlarged group once the
deal was completed.
The revised offer valued Kemper at Dollars 60 a share, Dollars 5 a share
less than the earlier bid.
GE Capital's offer of Dollars 60 a share in cash for Kemper in May was
rejected by Kemper's board as inadequate. The decision to spurn that bid
means it will be difficult for Kemper's directors to accept Conseco's lower
offer without facing lawsuits from shareholders.
Conseco said it had proposed the new offer to Kemper yesterday, but that its
initial offer remained in effect.
The cash portion in Conseco's revised bid is unchanged, at Dollars 56 a
share. But Kemper shareholders will now be offered fewer Conseco shares.
Under the new bid, Kemper shareholders would receive 0.1087 of a Conseco
share, in addition to the cash, leaving them with around 17 per cent of the
enlarged group.
The original offer would give them between 0.1982 and 0.2418 of a share,
depending on the value of Conseco's shares when the bid closed. With
Conseco's stock yesterday at Dollars 37 1/2 , down from more than Dollars 50
in June, Kemper shareholders would receive the maximum allocation, leaving
them with around 37 per cent in the new group.
The revised offer would not need Conseco shareholders' support, since it
would fall below the 20 per cent level requiring a shareholder vote.
Kemper said its board would review the new offer 'in due course'.

Santa Fe Pacific, the US railway company at the centre of a bidding war
between two other big US rail operators, yesterday said its board had
unanimously voted to reject an increased bid from Union Pacific and
reaffirmed its commitment to a friendly merger with Burlington Northern.
Last Sunday Union Pacific increased its hostile offer for Santa Fe to
Dollars 3.74bn, well above the value of an increased offer from Burlington
the previous Thursday. Burlington's all-share offer was last night worth
Dollars 3.08bn.
Santa Fe and Burlington continue to argue that the Union Pacific offer is
meaningless because it would almost certainly be ruled out on anti-trust
grounds.
They say that the Burlington offer, though worth less than Union Pacific's,
is much more likely to succeed.

Digital Equipment, the troubled US computer manufacturer, yesterday unveiled

It announced eight new workstations and mid-range machines based on its
world-leading Alpha technology, and discounts for dealers.
Alpha microprocessors are reckoned to be the world's fastest and Digital has
staked its future on their success.
Mr Enrico Pesatori, head of Digital's computer systems division, said
yesterday that in the first quarter of this year, Alpha sales rose by 138
per cent. Last year sales of Alpha technology amounted to Dollars 1bn.
The computers announced yesterday are an attempt to combine the power of
Alpha microprocessors with the economics of low-cost personal computers.
The new dealer discounts, with improved terms and conditions of service, are
an attempt to make Digital products more attractive to dealers and other
distributors.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aetna credit rating cut again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aetna, the US insurer, suffered another cut in its credit rating this week,
the latest in a rash of downgradings that has hit the US property/casualty
insurance industry in the wake of growing concerns over pollution and
asbestos liabilities.
Others to be downgraded in recent weeks include Cigna, which on Monday
announced a withdrawal from the reinsurance business to help rebuild the
profitability of its property/casualty operations, and Continental, which
last month set aside Dollars 400m for possible future pollution claims.
AM Best, the specialist insurance rating concern, said it had reduced
Aetna's rating to single-A minus from single A. It cited the company's long
drawn-out attempts to cut costs, as well as poor conditions in the
commercial property/casualty business and 'the ongoing earnings drag and
volatility associated with emerging environmental and asbestos claims'.
Aetna surprised Wall Street in July by announcing big pollution-related
costs. The company lost its double-A credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's in
August, and in September was cut to A2 from A1 by Moody's.
At the end of June, the company's reserves against environmental losses
stood at Dollars 334m - far less than other big insurers, such as Cigna,
whose reserves were Dollars 775m, according to insurance industry analysts
at Oppenheimer in New York. The contrast suggests that Aetna will have to
put aside significantly greater reserves in future, Oppenheimer said.
Cigna, meanwhile, lost its single-A standing in August when Moody's reduced
its rating to Baa1, citing in part its 'exposure to adverse loss development
from asbestos and environmental claims'.
Both Aetna and Cigna contested the agencies' decisions, arguing that they
failed to take account of efforts made by both to boost profitability in
their property/casualty businesses.
Mr William Wilt, an associate analyst at Moody's, said yesterday the agency
believed US insurers generally had adequate reserves to meet normal claims.
However, he added that catastrophe losses among insurers of personal
insurance, along with environmental and asbestos losses among commercial
insurers, could eventually prove these reserves to be totally inadequate.
Commenting on the possible scale of the future losses, Mr Wilt said:
'They're unquantifiable. It's anybody's guess, really.'

The new dealer discounts, coupled with improved terms and conditions of

it will provide partners with marketing support to increase demand and
broaden the market for Alpha products.
The company is already running a substantial advertising campaign to
reassure customers and potential customers of its commitment to the computer
business and this will be complemented by a rash of product advertising.
The Alpha machines, however, face stiff competition from Power PC computers
from Apple and IBM.

Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, aims to establish
itself as the leading software supplier for interactive broadband networks
that will provide interactive television and home PC services.
The company yesterday announced an 'end-to-end software solution' for
interactive TV, including distributed operating system software for
connecting television set-top boxes and personal computers with a wide
variety of services, plus media server software for delivering video on
demand and a set of interactive system applications.
The Microsoft software is to be tested in an interactive TV trial being
staged next year in Seattle, Washington, by Tele-Communications, the largest
US cable-TV operator.
Microsoft yesterday announced agreements with other network operators
including Deutsche Telekom, Telstra of Australia and US West Communications,
a regional US telephone company, which will also test the Microsoft
technology.
Previously, Rogers Cable-systems, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone and SBC
Communications also announced plans to use the Microsoft technology.
Hewlett-Packard, the second largest US computer company, and NEC of Japan,
are to develop set-top boxes that will be used to link TV sets to
interactive serv-ices using Microsoft software.
They join General Instrument, the leading maker of cable-TV converter boxes,
in supporting Microsoft technology.
NEC will also build 'media servers' for video on demand services. Intel and
Compaq Computer have previously announced their intention to build servers
compatible with the Microsoft software.
Several systems integrators including Alcatel, Andersen Consulting, Lockheed
Missiles &amp; Space, NTT Data Communications Systems and Olivetti have
committed to provide service and support for testing and global deployment
of the Microsoft technology,
'Microsoft is pleased to be working with a broad range of telecommunications
leaders as we complete the design of our system; together we can build a
basis for the evolving information society,' said Mr Craig Mundie,
vice-president of the advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.
Microsoft said it would publish details of interfaces needed to make use of
its software, and offer the development tools necessary for other developers
to create services, applications and multimedia content for interactive TV.
'Our strategy is to develop a deployable system, where the engineering work
is complete, and then test it at every increasing scale in order to get it
to commercial operation,' said Ms Laura Jennings, senior director of the
advanced consumer technology division at Microsoft.

<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the debt of
Salomon Inc, a week after the group's Salomon Brothers securities broking
unit reported its second consecutive quarter of heavy losses.
The downgrading of Salomon's senior debt rating, from single A minus to
triple B plus, will make it more expensive for Salomon to raise funds in the
capital markets, because issuers with lower ratings have to offer higher
yields to convince investors to buy their debt.
'The immediate effect is a higher cost of funding for Salomon,' said Mr
Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in New
York.
The loss of an A rating will also shrink the pool of potential buyers of
Salomon's debt, because some institutions do not invest in securities listed
below an A rating.
S&amp;P also lowered its ratings on Salomon's subordinated debt and preferred
stock.

<TEXT>
The partial privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, expected to raise about
DM15bn (Dollars 10bn) in 1996, is likely to involve US and UK banks because
of the importance of both countries' stock markets, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief
executive, said yesterday.
He did not say which investment bank the state-owned telecommunications
company preferred for the main international role of global co-ordinator.
But it was important to give banks from the countries containing the world's
most important stock exchanges a decisive say in the share placement, he
said.
'That naturally applies to the US just as much as it does for Britain,' he
said. 'I can't imagine that there would be any political considerations
which would exclude a strong American partner. There is no disagreement
between management and the owners (the government) in this matter.'
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is among the most likely candidates
to head the international placement, with Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers
and Morgan Stanley in the running, along with S. G. Warburg and Kleinwort
Benson from the UK.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank are expected to be named the overall
managers of the privatisation issue, which is likely to be split into
regional consortiums to cover Germany, the rest of Europe, North America and
the rest of the world.
A final decision is expected shortly, with banks standing to earn fees of
about DM450m from the placement.
However, Mr Ricke said a decision on which banks would be involved in the
issue would not be made as early as this week. 'We are under a certain
amount of time pressure but we will need to evaluate the matter more
carefully than that.'
Deutsche Telekom invited 22 of the world's leading investment banks to a
'beauty contest' in Bonn at which they presented their respective bids to
the company and the finance and postal ministries.
'They are all good,' Mr Ricke said. 'We now have to decide what their
particular strengths are, what connections they might have to companies
which we regard as our competitors.'

<TEXT>
Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third largest bank, said annual
consolidated net income for 1994 would be 'clearly below' the record
SFr1.37bn (Dollars 1.1bn) achieved last year.
SBC said operating income after nine months failed to match 1993's
performance. The bank was echoing recent statements from Switzerland's two
other large banks.
No figures were given, but the bank blamed the uncertainty in financial
markets for most of the decline.
The trend of trading income was the same as in the first half of the year,
when it tumbled 63 per cent. Income from securities trading picked up in the
third quarter, but revenues from foreign exchange were down.
Net commission income, up 11 per cent in the first half, was down in the
third quarter because of a fall in brokerage and syndication and placement
fees.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Decline in loan losses boosts
SE-Banken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A big drop in loan losses enabled Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken to
compensate for a weaker underlying performance in the first nine months and
lift profits to SKr2.87bn (Dollars 400m) from SKr71m.
Sweden's leading commercial bank said the SKr2.8bn improvement included
SKr789m in capital gains.
The main impact on the figures came from a 44 per cent cut in loan losses to
SKr4.35bn.
Like other Swedish banks, SE-Banken has benefited from lower interest rates
and economic recovery and put behind it the crisis that brought it large
losses due to collapsing property values in 1992.
However, its result before loan losses was 7 per cent worse than a year ago
at SKr7.23bn. Excluding this year's capital gains, the deterioration would
have been 17 per cent.
The worse underlying performance reflected:
A 10 per cent reduction in net interest income to SKr6.36bn, caused by a
continued drop in lending volumes and narrower interest rate margins.
A 12 per cent fall in commissions, fees and foreign exchange earnings to
SKr4.37bn. This reflects lower activity in most financial markets.
A 5 per cent rise in costs to SKr5.95bn
Excluding capital gains, the group's third-quarter profit was SKr602m,
compared with SKr755m in the second quarter and SKr730m in the first three
months.
The bank said adjustments in the value of its investment portfolio were only
taken into account at the year-end. It said the large rise in long-term
interest rates this year meant the market value of its SKr82.4bn bond
portfolio on September 30 was SKr963m lower than the acquisition value.

<TEXT>
Christiania Bank, Norway's second-largest commercial bank, yesterday
reported a sharp improvement in its nine-month results. The bank benefited
from the continued upturn in Norway's economy, which has improved borrowers'
ability to service loans.
Christiania said nine-month pre-tax profits nearly doubled to NKr1.12bn
(Dollars 171m) from NKr628m in the same period last year, providing further
evidence that Norwegian banks are emerging from a four-year crisis.
However, the group's operating profit, before loan losses, dropped NKr649m
to NKr1.22bn.
Net interest income was unchanged at NKr2.33bn but non-interest income fell
by NKr638m to NKr1.13bn due to reduced securities and foreign exchange
gains.
Christiania said that a low level of interest rate exposure in the
securities portfolio, helped limit bond losses in the third quarter to
NKr10m.
In the nine-month period, securities gains fell sharply to NKr94m from
NKr591m while foreign exchange gains and other non-interest income dropped
NKr101m to NKr145m.
Nevertheless, the bank sharply reduced nine-month provisions for losses on
loans and guarantees, to NKr100m from NKr1.24bn last year. Included in this
year's figure is net reversals of NKr284m covering previous loss provisions.
Christiania said credit losses to the international fisheries industry were
the most troubled sector of its loan portfolio.
In the third quarter the bank made provisions of NKr93m to cover fisheries
loan losses, which for the nine-month period reached NKr384m. But combined
gross non-performing and doubtful loans were reduced by 27 per cent to
NKr11bn, while net non-performing loans were cut by 37 per cent to NKr3.6bn.
While expressing satisfaction with the results, Mr Borger Lenth, group
managing director, warned there was still room for improvement.
The board may consider paying a dividend for 1994, but this is understood to
be conditional on the bank's core capital reaching 6 per cent of
risk-weighted assets at end-December, and on continued improvement in
performance.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: BCH tumbles 38% in first nine
months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Banco Central Hispano (BCH), the Spanish financial group,
tumbled 37.6 per cent to Pta45.3bn (Dollars 363m) in the first nine months
as a result of lower income from disposals and an increase in loan-loss
provisions.
In contrast, BCH's core banking business improved sharply over the period as
the group raised operating profit 17.5 per cent to Pta104.9bn.
Net consolidated profits fell 25.3 per cent to Pta32.3bn, by far the lowest
among the leading domestic banks. This raises the prospect that BCH could be
forced to reduce its dividend next year in order to strengthen its balance
sheet.
The bank's future profitability was nevertheless underlined by an improved
net interest income, which rose 4.1 per cent to Pta235.3bn over the nine
months. This was in spite of the drop in interest rates and the resulting
squeeze on margins.
Fees from commissions rose 6.9 per cent to Pta64.4bn and total net revenue
advanced 5.5 per cent to Pta308.2bn.
The brighter outlook for BCH's pure banking operations was clouded by the
continuing need to raise the coverage for its damaged loan portfolio.
This drain on resources was aggravated over the nine months by lower
revenues from its treasury department and a fall in gains from disposals,
which brought extraordinary income over the period down 35.2 per cent to
Pta40.7bn.
BCH has put aside Pta106.6bn for provisions between January and September,
33.7 per cent more than last year.
This addresses the concerns of rating agencies, which have raised questions
about the quality of BCH's assets and downgraded the banking group.
At the end of September BCH's coverage stood at 76.6 per cent, without
taking mortgage-linked guarantees into account. This figure is comparable to
that of rival domestic banks and up from its 69 per cent coverage in June.
BCH's non-performing loans represented 7 per cent of the group's total
lending at the end of September - above the average for the sector, but 1
per cent down on the end of last year.
BCH realised Pta30.3bn between January and September through the recovery of
non-performing loans, 57.4 per cent up on the same period last year.
BCH's return on assets stood at 0.40 and its return on equity at 7.8 per
cent, figures well below the average for the sector in Spain.

FT  03 NOV 94 / International Company News: Consolidation in Italian banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The shape of Italian banking changed yesterday with a merger and takeover
which will further strengthen the private sector.
Ambroveneto is being taken over by Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) to
create the country's second largest banking group.
Comit last night said it wanted 51 per cent of Ambroveneto but would aim
initially for 29 per cent of the stock held by the core of controlling
shareholders. It offered L7,000 a share for the 144.4m shares among these
shareholders.
Meanwhile Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), a Bologna-based bank, is merging with
the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna group (Caer), a regional savings
institution, to fight off the hostile bid by recently privatised Credito
Italiano.
The Rolo-Caer merger came as a surprise and will create Italy's tenth
largest bank. It comes less than a month after the two had abandoned
year-long talks on a smaller-scale merger.
The defensive move by Rolo, controlled by a core of shareholders led by Mr
Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, will have to overcome complex
legal considerations, centring on whether a merger could occur while a
takeover bid was in progress.
The formal takeover by Credito Italiano cannot be launched until the
prospectus has been approved by Consob, the stock exchange watchdog. This is
unlikely to be completed until November 15 and could mean that the first
extraordinary meeting of Rolo shareholders will vote not on the takeover
offer but the merger.
Rolo's big shareholders, including France's BNP and Mr De Benedetti, have
yet to comment on the merger plan.
The L2,010bn (Dollars 1.3bn) Credito bid for 48.2 per cent of Rolo's stock,
valuing each share at L19,000, was launched last Wednesday and is the
largest in Italy since new takeover rules were introduced in 1992.
It followed three weeks of heavy trading in Rolo shares which rose more than
30 per cent. But the Bologna bank denied any prior discussions with Credito,
claiming the bid was hostile.
Rolo's decision comes after the appointment of foreign advisers Goldman
Sachs International and Morgan Stanley to assess the takeover. Rolo said
yesterday the merger, which would be cashless, would be on the basis of 1.31
of its nominal L1,000 shares for every nominal L10,000 Caer share.
Rolo said it was currently valued at L4,895bn. This is a premium of about
L3,000 a share on the Credito offer and applies to all the shares, not just
48.2 per cent. Caer was valued at L2,397bn.

<TEXT>
Akzo Nobel, the Dutch chemicals group, said net profit before extraordinary
items rose 34.7 per cent in the third quarter. This reflected increased
sales volumes and reduced costs.
The sharp improvement was seen in most divisions, with even the weak fibres
sector producing a small profit after losses a year earlier.
Net profit totalled Fl 322m (Dollars 192m) before extraordinary items,
compared with Fl 239m a year earlier. Profits after extraordinary items
jumped 75 per cent because the 1993 result was weighed down by Fl 55m in
charges related to spinning off loss-making activities into joint ventures.
There were no extraordinary items in the 1994 quarter.
Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director, said the result confirmed expectations
that second-half results in 1994 would be above those in 1993. The company
left its interim dividend unchanged at Fl 1.50 a share.
Economic recovery in Europe, coupled with continued good business conditions
in the US, lifted sales volumes 5 per cent. Average selling prices rose 2
per cent, but Akzo Nobel faced a similar rate of increase in its own raw
material costs.
Turnover rose 4.3 per cent to Fl 5.42bn, and would have been higher if it
had not been for the dollar's decline.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Butte issues amendment to 1993 accounts
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Butte Mining, the London-listed company whose main activity is pursuing US
lawsuits, has amended its accounts after discussions with the Financial
Reporting Review Panel - the accounts watchdog.
Butte, which is seeking Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in damages from former
managers and promoters, has issued a supplementary note relating to its
accounts for the year to June 1993 in its 1994 report and accounts.
The panel's statement, the 24th it has issued as a watchdog since its
foundation in 1991, expresses concern that a bank overdraft of Pounds
750,000 was shown in the balance sheet as falling due after more than one
year.
In Butte's opinion the overdraft could not be shown as falling due within a
year and still give a true and fair view of the company's affairs.
It claimed the overdraft payment was entangled with a Montana law suit and
could not fall due within a year. The company, however, did not want to
'become party to a test case'.
On two other counts the company had invoked the true and fair override with
respect to the cash flow statement but the panel considered the treatment
incorrect.
It noted that a Pounds 560,000 sale of an equity investment was not shown in
the cash flow statement but was 'incorrectly' treated as a cash equivalent.
Also, a repayment loan of Pounds 500,000 was not shown because it was
'incorrectly' treated as a cash equivalent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Fiduciary Trust, which former England cricketer Mr Phil Edmonds aims
to build into a substantial gold producer, has acquired a heap-leach gold
project in the Philippines from Runruno Mining Corporation for Pounds 6m.
The purchase is to be satisfied by the issue of LFT shares at 5p each,
compared with yesterday's market price of 2 1/2 p-3 1/2 p. The vendors have
agreed to retain these shares for at least a year from the date of issue.
LFT said an independent appraisal of the Runruno project suggests it has
reserves for annual production of 50,000 troy ounces of gold for eight years

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BS attacks continental subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel has said that it is being put off from investing in the UK and
the rest of Europe by the subsidies allowed to competitors on the continent.
Mr Brian Moffatt, chairman and chief executive, told a Commons trade and
industry committee that these subsidies would undermine British Steel's
profitability as UK economic growth slowed.
He said: 'To take on companies whose losses are subsidised is something we
are not capable of doing.'
Mr Moffatt told MPs that if these subsidies continued, his board felt that
there were much more attractive areas in which to invest. He cited the
group's recent decision to build a Pounds 97m mini-mill at Tuscaloosa Steel,
its Alabama subsidiary.
British Steel, Europe's second largest producer after France's state-owned
Usinor Sacilor, has strongly opposed aid to public companies to help them
restructure.
It has even launched an action against the European Commission at the
European Court of Justice, accusing it of breaking its own rules on
subsidies.
An EC plan to restructure the industry collapsed last week after steel
companies did not come up with the cuts in capacity required for the project
to proceed.
Mr Moffatt also said the future for the industry was bleaker.
'The economy is moving forward at the moment, but when the next slowdown
comes, if the subsidy argument is not put to bed now, it will be back with
us in a few years' time.'
This argument was echoed by Mr Ian Blakey, director-general of the British
Iron and Steel Producers Association.
He said: 'We must be storing up trouble for the next recession. We must
stamp out subsidies and let the market take its course and it will take its
course during the next recession.'
Mr Moffatt urged the UK government, which cut British Steel off from aid in
1985, to act as a referee on state aid in the European Union and be
consistent about its stance on the issue.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca seeks US healthcare links - Deal
involving investment of up to Dollars 300m expected in few months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca, the drugs company is considering forming joint ventures with US
healthcare suppliers as an alternative to the multi-billion dollar
acquisitions made by rivals such as SmithKline Beecham.
A deal involving either a joint venture or close links with a US healthcare
company is likely within four months.
It would probably involve a cash commitment of between Dollars 200m and
Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) over several years.
Creating a free-standing joint venture would be an unusual approach to
dealing with the newly cost-conscious US healthcare industry.
The highest profile strategies so far have been from SmithKline and two US
companies, Merck and Eli Lilly. Between them the two US companies have spent
more than Dollars 12bn in 15 months on buying Pharmacy Benefit Managers
(PBMs) and Health Management Organisations (HMOs). These are two types of
business which negotiate deals with hospitals and drug makers on behalf of
employers who pay health insurance premiums for employees.
But last month's decision by the US Federal Trade Commission to impose
conditions on the Eli Lilly purchase has put the whole acquisition strategy
in question.
Zeneca is in talks with several HMOs on a tie up. It has established Stuart
Disease Management in the US.
Disease management programmes are attracting increasing interest in the US.
The idea is that patient care should include the provision of non-drug
treatments, such as diet regimes and screening programmes.
Zeneca's biggest-selling product is Zestril, the heart drug. The company
also produces low-fat, low-salt foods - of the kind recommended for many
heart disease sufferers - that could find new markets in healthcare.
Mr David Barnes, Zeneca chief executive, said yesterday he wanted to keep
open options that would be closed by a large purchase.
He said the approach pioneered by US company Pfizer, which this year set up
a Dollars 100m disease management programme with HMO Valu-Health, was a good
model.
Zeneca has already signed three preliminary contracts with HMOs. The work
they will undertake, under a system called capitation, is designed to 'share
the risk in healthcare,' said Mr Barnes.
Under the system a company receives a flat fee for treatment per head of
population rather than a per treatment payment.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Recovery continues at Frederick Cooper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frederick Cooper, the architectural hardware, metal finishing and electrical
products group, continued its recovery with a 30 per cent advance in annual
pre-tax profits from 'underlying operations' to Pounds 5.45m.
On an FRS 3 basis the rise was greater at 53 per cent to Pounds 6.31m
(Pounds 4.12m) for the year to July 31. Turnover grew to Pounds 89.1m
(Pounds 84.3m).
The focusing on core businesses continued with the sale of Cooper Handling
in June for Pounds 1.46m. This resulted in a Pounds 896,000 exceptional
profit. Mr Ed Kirk, chairman, said the surplus gave a distorted impression
of group progress.
Since the year-end, Futters (London), an electrical component company was
sold for Pounds 3.75m. Three businesses in the electrical products division
remained, generating only Pounds 7m of turnover. He expected to dispose of
at least one within the next 12 months.
In spite of the profits rise and a 3 per cent increase in first-quarter
sales in the current year, Mr Kirk remained cautious on prospects.
He said the UK economy remained fragile and the architectural products side,
which makes locks and other door and window fittings, catered for the 'back
end of the construction market'. Also, in the past 12 months the price of
aluminium had risen 30 per cent; steel had risen 6 per cent since the start
of the year and would rise another 6 per cent in January; and European
polymer prices had risen 10 per cent. Cooper was now also sourcing from
Brazil and altering its plastic compounds 'mix' to help circumvent this.
In the architectural hardware division, profits jumped to Pounds 1.56m
(Pounds 570,000) on turnover up slightly at Pounds 50.1m (Pounds 49.6m). In
metal finishing, profits were Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of
Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 20m). Organic growth for the group would come in the US
metal finishing side, said Mr Kirk, with any acquisitions also in that area.
At the year-end borrowings were Pounds 7m; they were now less than Pounds 5m
and by July 1995 were expected to be about Pounds 2.5m.
Basic earnings on underlying operations were 6p (3.5p) and under FRS 3 8.2p
(3.4p). The final dividend is lifted to 1.7p (1.5p) for a total of 2.5p
(2.2p).

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Bellway's 67% rise beats City forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Bellway rose 14p to 208p yesterday as the housebuilder outstripped
City forecasts to announce a 67 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the
year to July 31.
Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 28m (Pounds 16.7m) on turnover up 37 per cent
at Pounds 201.3m (Pounds 147.2m). Operating margins were lifted from 10 to
13.5 per cent.
Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said the company's performance was the result of
'our policy of controlled expansion of the management, the organisation and
the land portfolio throughout the recession'.
The middle-market group sold 3,010 homes, a rise of 31 per cent, at an
average price which rose 6 per cent to Pounds 65,000.
Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said: 'Our sales are 20 per cent up in the
current year. We have been expanding over the last four years by about 25
per cent per annum and I think there is good momentum in the market at the
moment.'
He added that the company expected prices and margins to remain static this
year.
Cash fell from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 6.42m as the group purchased Pounds
100m of land at low prices last year. Year-end net cash stood at Pounds 1m
(Pounds 44m).
Bellway has some 12,000 plots with planning permission, representing more
than three years' building. The company further committed itself to Pounds
18m of land in the first three months of the year.
The group won Pounds 15m of City Grant awards to build 649 units in
Manchester and 479 units in London. The latter is part of a long-term
development to build 5,500 houses in Barking.
Earnings per share rose 63 per cent to 17.3p (10.6p). The board proposes a
final dividend of 4.8p to make a total of 7p, compared with 6p last year.
COMMENT
Bellway seems to have weathered the recession with a healthy balance sheet
and strong sales. Yesterday's figures owe much to the group's shrewd
purchasing policy, which should allow consistent growth this year. It is now
expected to gear up to about 30 per cent to maintain its purchasing
programme. Pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 32.5m, which gives a
fairly low p/e of 10. Given the group's steady performance in recent years
and growth prospects, this looks like an undeserved discount to the sector.

A group of businesses which claims to have paid a total of almost Dollars 4m
(Pounds 2.5m) in retainers in the hope of raising finance which never
materialised has attacked the government for failing to regulate brokers who
promise to introduce individuals to funders.
The Turnberry/Bond Street Pressure Group has written to authorities
including Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Ms Maureen
Pasterfield, chairperson of the group, calls on the government 'to close the
loophole which has caused so much suffering to British businesses'.
Pressure group members paid fees to corporate brokers who said they could
introduce clients to syndicated finance through US contacts.
'These people take fees to put people in touch with alleged funders,' said
Ms Pasterfield. 'Brokers introducing people to mortgages need consumer
credit licences and are regulated by the Securities and Investments Board.
Yet those who say they will introduce businesses to financiers are governed
by no one.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to buy 20% of Czech utility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Welsh Water has agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in the biggest water and
waste disposal operator in the Czech republic.
The UK utility is set to pay the Czech privatisation ministry Kcs198.6m
(Pounds 4.48m) for the stake in Severoceske Vodovody a Kanalizace, marking
its first investment in central Europe.
Although no contract has been signed and the agreement must be approved by
the Czech government, Mr Graham Hawker, chief executive of Welsh Water, said
negotiations were 'at the formalities stage.' Officials of SCVK were not
available for comment yesterday.
The two companies have been in negotiations for nearly two years.
Mr Hawker said Welsh Water intended to take an active management role in
SCVK. It was also seeking to buy further shares from local investors who
hold 58 per cent of SCVK, to allow it 'to influence management decisions.'
He ruled out taking a majority stake in the immediate future.
SCVK was privatised in the Czech government's second wave of coupon
privatisations this year, and is expected to be listed on the Prague bourse
next February when second-wave shares are released to investors.
It provides water and waste disposal services to about 1m customers in
northern Bohemia, and made profits of Kcs50m last year on turnover of
Kcs1.2bn. Welsh Water, which has nearly 3m customers in Wales and western
England, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 144.2m on turnover of Pounds 512.1m
last year.
Mr Hawker said Welsh Water had identified the Czech republic as a key market
in central Europe. The investment in SCVK could lead to further expansion in
the region, but he said Welsh Water had 'no plans other than to consolidate
in the Czech republic' at present.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: The preferred route to recovery - British
Coal's cast-off could be Anglo's salvation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo United shareholders could not believe their eyes when they read their
newspapers on Tuesday morning.
The company they have supported through two debt restructurings and a rescue
rights issue had been nominated by British Coal and its adviser Price
Waterhouse as one of four preferred bidders for its smokeless fuels
subsidiary, Coal Products.
If it succeeds, Anglo will certainly have to restructure the debt yet again
and call on shareholders to finance the acquisition. It is thought Anglo has
offered between Pounds 60m and Pounds 90m in the initial bidding round for
Coal Products, all of which will have to come from shareholders.
On the surface, Anglo's preferred status appears surprising. The company has
incurred losses for the past two years and has negative shareholders' funds
of about Pounds 146m.
In the words of one Anglo executive, gearing is out in the stratosphere.
Debt remains a weighty Pounds 96m and no dividends are expected to be paid
until borrowing ratios return to earth. The shares were last trading at
about 2p.
Nor does the company's history provide much comfort. It made headlines in
the late 1980s with its Pounds 500m hostile takeover of Coalite, one of the
UK's last great leveraged bids.
The bid was the brainchild of Mr David McErlain, Anglo's former chairman,
whose Coal Developments company is also one of the preferred bidders for
Coal Products. He intended to pay off the debt incurred by the Coalite
takeover by selling off the target's peripheral businesses.
Unfortunately, recession and problems encountered in selling assets hindered
his plans, and by 1991 the company was forced to defer loan repayments.
Over the next two years, Anglo launched a Pounds 25m rescue rights issue to
pay off a bridging loan and two debt restructurings. The most recent,
completed last year, left the banks owning half the company. Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation is the largest shareholder with 40 per cent.
The banks have been crucial to Anglo's success in passing the initial tests
in the bid for Coal Products. They are understood to have given assurances
of support for the required equity funding and debt restructuring.
It is likely that for Anglo to become the sole preferred bidder, it will
have to have the debt restructuring and plans for a rights issue ready to go
by the end of the year.
The restructuring is likely to be a complex issue. While winning Coal
Products could go some way to reducing the deficit in shareholders' funds, a
substantial debt for equity swap is almost certain to be on the cards yet
again.
Anglo refuses to comment on its bid or the comfort it might have received
from shareholders. However, winning Coal Products could give it the vital
breathing space it needs to find its feet.
Coalite is its most profitable business. Yet the smokeless fuel market is
declining as consumers' switch to gas-fired central heating. Still, the
business is highly cash generative and the synergies with Coal Products
could be substantial.
Anglo's need to squeeze value out of a declining market, if it is to
survive, could give it a substantial edge in the bidding. Shareholders
might, perhaps, be motivated to support a higher bid as a result.
Ordinary shareholders do not appear to care why Anglo has been included in
the shortlist. They are delighted. 'The key point is that the banks did not
just say let's squeeze every last drop out of the company until it's dry and
walk away,' said one investor. 'They have been prepared to work their way
out of the situation, give the company time to breathe and take it forward.
We are very happy.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Food price inflation rise feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Sainsbury, above, chairman of J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food
retailer, warned that levels of food price inflation were likely to rise
slightly in the coming months, although price competition would remain
intense, writes Neil Buckley.
Mr Sainsbury said the group had experienced selling price deflation of about
0.6 per cent in the first half of the year largely as a result of its
'Essential for Essentials' price-cutting campaign, involving permanent price
reductions on own-label goods.
So far in the second half, sales inflation was running at 0.2 per cent, and
the rate was likely to increase slightly as Sainsbury reached the
anniversary of the 'Essentials' campaign.
Mr Sainsbury said the campaign had 'effectively led down prices and gross
margins' for basic products 'throughout the food retail sector', putting
pressure both on superstore competitors and on discount chains.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Realigned Lonrho board meets - First
get-together since the shift in the balance of power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the international trading group whose joint chief executives, Mr
Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock, have been at war with each other, will
today hold its first board meeting since the retirement of two of Mr
Rowland's closest allies.
The retirements have shifted the balance on the board in favour of Mr Bock
in his struggle against Mr Rowland. An associate of Mr Rowland said
yesterday that today's meeting would be significant in showing how Mr Bock
intended to exploit this power.
Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland from his
executive duties. However, hours before September's board meeting Mr Bock
backed off from proposing that Mr Rowland should step down when he became
concerned that he could not count on the support of a majority.
A number of Lonrho's directors belatedly took fright from challenging Mr
Rowland because they were concerned that he would challenge any attempt to
oust him through the courts.
Today's meeting is the first to be chaired by the new temporary chairman,
the former diplomat Sir John Leahy. He replaces Mr Rene Leclezio, one of Mr
Rowland's staunchest allies, who retired last month. Another of Mr Rowland's
most loyal supporters, Mr Robert Dunlop, also retired recently.
It is widely believed within Lonrho that Mr Rowland would sever his 30-year
relationship with the company if Mr Bock, owner of 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's
shares, offered him a Pounds 50m premium over the market price for his 48.6m
shares. However Mr Bock is thought not to be prepared to pay that price.
Today's meeting is also the first since the disclosure last week in the
Financial Times that Mr Rowland had embroiled the company in a new court
case brought by its erstwhile corporate opponent, Mr Mohamed Fayed, by
providing an indemnity to a former employee of Mr Fayed, Mr Graham Jones,
who allegedly defected to Lonrho.
Mr Fayed is suing Mr Jones for breach of confidence and is therefore also in
effect suing Lonrho. It is particularly embarrassing for Lonrho that it
should find itself on the opposite side of a case brought by Mr Fayed,
because it is only a year since they settled their bitter and costly legal
battle over the manner in which Mr Fayed purchased House of Fraser in 1985.
According to an associate of Mr Rowland, the indemnity is likely to be
discussed by the board meeting.
Mr Rowland will insist that he has not damaged Lonrho because he will say
that Mr Fayed is once again his friend and would not pursue the action if it
was seen to be hurting him.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BAe reserves right to lift VSEL bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace yesterday refused to rule out making a revised offer for
VSEL, the nuclear submarine maker. Mr Bob Bauman, chairman, told BAe
shareholders that although it expected GEC's rival Pounds 532m offer to be
blocked on competition grounds, BAe reserved the right to increase its own
bid.
'Our offer is an open one, which doesn't prevent an increase,' he said.
Two and a half weeks ago, BAe offered 2.474 shares for each VSEL share with
a cash alternative of Pounds 11.40. At BAe's closing price yesterday, down
2p at 450p, the bid values each VSEL share at Pounds 12.36.
Mr Bauman, however, claimed that the VSEL board would recommend the BAe
offer ahead of GEC's cash bid because it would secure the future of its
Barrow shipyard and open new markets for its land-based defence systems.
'It is also in the best interest of VSEL as it poses no competition concerns
for defence procurement in the UK,' he said.
Shareholders approved a resolution allowing BAe to proceed with the offer,
despite a series of questions to the board over a clause allowing it to
extend or amend the bid.
Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, sought to reassure investors that a
revised offer might not be necessary by pointing out that if BAe's share
price rose by 60p the current bid would be worth Pounds 14 a share.
Justifying the proposed acquisition, he added that VSEL profits would reduce
BAe's tax rate from 33 to 25 per cent and greatly strengthen its balance
sheet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manchester United yesterday confirmed plans to expand the capacity of its
Old Trafford stadium by 22 per cent to 54,000.
The company refused to reveal how it would finance the expansion or how much
it would cost, saying the application for planning consent was only a
preliminary step.
It is expected to use part of its Pounds 13.6m cash reserves to fund the
development and acquisition of adjacent land.
Shareholders, however, will be asked to reconfirm the directors right to
launch a rights issue, according to the annual report published yesterday.
The accounts also showed that Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive, received a
23 per cent pay increase from Pounds 174,000 to Pounds 214,000 in the year
to July 31.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tele-Cine Cell to join market with Pounds
20m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Tele-Cine Cell have been priced at 170p, valuing the Soho-based
group at Pounds 20m. The video editing and special effects group whose
recent projects have included Guinness's 'glass universe' commercial, is
coming to market via a placing of 4.7m shares, representing 40 per cent of
the expanded capital.
Half the shares are being sold by existing shareholders including the
group's joint managing directors, Mr John Rowland and Mr Paul O'Hagan, who
will each retain a 13.5 per cent stake. They will make a little more than
Pounds 900,000 each and Mr John Graves, co-founder of Tele-Cine, will
receive about Pounds 2.2m.
The remaining 2.25m shares are being issued by the group to raise Pounds 4m
new funds. This will be used to reduce borrowings and provide working
capital.
The group is divided into two main businesses, both of which operate in fast
growing high-technology markets.
Tele-Cine undertakes film transfer, video editing and sound mixing, together
with tape transfer, standards conversion and archiving. Cell uses motion
control filming, 3D computer graphics and digital editing systems to create
special effects sequences.
The group continued to grow organically through the recession and capital
expenditure has amounted to Pounds 8.3m in the last 3 1/2 years.
Last year the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 778,000) on
turnover of Pounds 9.69m (Pounds 8.1m). Profits grew to Pounds 1.28m in the
six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 6.19m. Directors have forecast
full-year pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 2.2m.
On the basis of the forecast earnings per share for the year the flotation
price represents a prospective multiple of 11.8. Dealings are expected to
begin on November 10.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: New Look postpones flotation plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The adverse market conditions for new issues were yesterday blamed for yet
another postponement when New Look, the Dorset-based women's wear chain,
cancelled its flotation plans.
The company, which had been hoping for a market value in excess of Pounds
150m, was due to announce the pricing of its shares today.
Schroders, the company's advisers, said: 'In this negative environment,
people were looking for any excuse not to invest. They couldn't believe that
its rate of success could continue.'
Fund managers approached by the company and its advisers in the past couple
of days said they had been offered the shares at a 30 per cent discount to
the retail sector - a surprising figure even in the current subdued
environment for new issues - and had turned them down.
One institutional investor said: 'I had reservations about the management,
the management structure and the rate of expansion, it's as simple as that.'
Another added: 'With such high margin rates, we were concerned over any
further room for growth.'
Some 35 per cent of the equity was due to come to the market through a
placing and intermediaries offer. The flotation was to have raised about
Pounds 10m of new money.
New Look, which has 224 shops, is aimed at the lower end of the women's
fashion market. It has more than tripled operating profits and turnover in
the past three years. Profits of Pounds 11m last year were almost matched by
the Pounds 9.92m posted for the six months to September 24. Operating
margins were 16.9 per cent.
The company, founded in 1969, is owned by the Singh family, with Mr Tom
Singh, the deputy chairman. Other members of the board included Mr Louis
Sherwood, the non-executive chairman, who was appointed in September.
Another non-executive was appointed last month, as was the finance director,
Mr Peter Phillips, formerly of Hepworth and British Nuclear Fuels.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Confident in the ability to deliver - John
Weston puts BAe's case for taking over VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle over VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker, is starting to get
aggressive. In part that is because the fight is not just about the future
of one shipyard in Cumbria, but about the future direction of the entire UK
defence industry. And as it is so important, it is a fight which neither
side can afford to lose.
So what kind of industry will it be and will British Aerospace or GEC lead
it?
Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace's defence arm, speaks with
obvious conviction about who should be in the driving seat. 'If the
government has to pick a national champion in defence, then I think
leadership by GEC is not the best solution.'
His view is that British Aerospace has the right skills, right products and
the imagination necessary to succeed in the increasingly complex world of
defence manufacturing. For good measure he adds that while BAe has had its
fair share of problems with its civil operations, its defence arm has been
consistently profitable with good margins and is 50 per cent larger than
GEC's defence operation.
'Systems integration and the ability to manage prime contracts are the most
important areas for a defence company now,' he argues.
Mr Weston's point is that modern military systems are so complex that
controlling the process of putting the parts together is as important as the
ability to design new equipment itself.
With the ministry of defence pushing more of the financial risks of
developing and manufacturing equipment on to defence companies, the skill of
being able to control a project with hundreds of subcontractors and
suppliers, and millions of components, is vital for profitability. These are
two skills which, he claims, BAe has in abundance.
'Things have changed enormously over the past 50 years. The Spitfire was
probably designed by a team of at most 50 engineers. We have between 4,000
and 5,000 people working on the Eurofighter design. It is no longer possible
to talk of individuals designing aircraft. You need the systems to be able
to control that hugely complex process.'
In the case of VSEL, the job of bringing together the electronics, nuclear
reactor, sonar, weapons and manufacture of the pressure hull of a submarine
and making them work is a similar job to the production of a fighter
aircraft. Hence Mr Weston's belief that, despite the obvious differences
between silent submarines and fast jets, BAe is well placed to run the
shipyard.
On the wider issue of the future of the defence industry in Europe, Mr
Weston is looking to strengthening cross border alliances, and as prime
contracting skills are the most important element, he thinks BAe is well
placed to take a leading role.
In military affairs 'European integration is going on, none of the armed
forces can now afford a fully independent set of skills, and they are
becoming interdependent. Industry is following that trend.'
The process has been slower in Europe than in the US, where mergers and
rationalisation have been happening at breakneck pace. There is also a
strong suspicion among many observers that when continental Europeans talk
about rationalisation, they mean someone else.
'The UK has started to grasp the rationalisation issue. Some of our
continental partners have taken a little longer to get there, but there is
now a consciousness that change is necessary,' he says.
Some moves towards cross-border links are already happening. BAe is
negotiating to merge its missile business with Matra of France. It has also
looked at a merger of its Royal Ordnance operation with Giat, the French
ammunition manufacturer.
Mr Weston also points to the way BAe's military division has retrenched in
the 1990s as proof that the company has taken the hard decisions. 'In the
past five years we have reduced the number of people in our military
business from 66,000 to 31,000, at the same time as increasing sales by 10
per cent.'
According to Mr Weston, BAe is also doing all the other Good Things which
any switched-on manufacturer must do to survive in the 1990s. 'We have had a
major drive to find out what our customers want and give it to them. We are
now trying to get the most out of our people, and encouraging them to learn
from other parts of the business and outside. We want to eliminate the 'not
invented here' mentality which can be so damaging.'
In the end, however, doesn't GEC's greater financial muscle give it an
enormous advantage over BAe? If it does, Mr Weston professes not to be
impressed. 'Financial strength is undoubtedly helpful. But the defence
business is not ultimately about financial strength and making black boxes.
It is about delivering systems to spec and on time.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Half of BZW staff may be moved to Canary
Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays,
yesterday told its 3,500 staff that more than half of them were likely to be
relocated to Canary Wharf in East London.
In an internal memorandum, it told employees that it was in negotiations to
rent two trading floors, or about 500,000 sq ft of space.
The deal would be a boost for the east London property development, which
was refinanced by its banks last year and came out of administration. It was
built by the Canadian developer, Mr Paul Reichmann, at the turn of the
decade.
BZW's decision to reconsider Canary Wharf will surprise many in the City,
because only last month it was widely reported that it had decided not to
move there.
However, Mr Martin Taylor, Barclay's chief executive, said the previous
decision was that the whole of BZW should not move so far from the City.
However, there was a strong case for moving staff to Canary Wharf who did
not need to meet clients regularly.
Among departments likely to move are: markets, which include bond, foreign
exchange and money market trading, and debt capital markets, which combines
the creation and trading of derivative products.
The firm's corporate finance and equity departments are likely to remain
closer to the City. They are expected to occupy Royal Mint Court, the
refurbished eighteenth century building already occupied by Barclays' senior
management.
Mr Taylor said that the decision of where to house the investment banking
firm was one of the most difficult he had faced since joining the bank last
year.
Barclays was one of the main lenders to Canary Wharf and has suffered
significant losses on its loans to the project.

FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BET rises to Pounds 58m amid signs of
better margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group, reported a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 46.1m to Pounds 57.7m for the six months to October 1,
and said it was seeing signs of improvement in its profit margins.
Turnover fell from Pounds 880m to Pounds 864m, but last year's figure
included businesses sold in the first half. Excluding disposals, sales rose
by 1 per cent.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 49.3m). Earnings per share
grew to 4.5p (3.3p) and the interim dividend was increased to 1.2p (1p).
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said: 'The increase in published earnings
and the early signs of improvement in overall gross margins are both
encouraging.
'We continue to seek improvements in productivity which will offset cost
inflation and price pressure. These actions are key to 1994-95 earnings
growth.'
Capital expenditure in the first half more than doubled to Pounds 78m. Net
cash at the period end was Pounds 18m, against Pounds 9m last September and
Pounds 67m at the year end in April. Shareholders' funds increased to Pounds
288m, against Pounds 260m at the year end.
Mr Keith Payne, director of finance, planning and development, said the
group had spent Pounds 2m on bolt-on acquisitions during the first half. He
expected to conclude several deals during the second half.
Mr Clark said in May that the group was willing to consider acquisitions
again after a long period of divestments. He said yesterday that he would be
prepared to let gearing rise to about 30 per cent, if the right opportunity
arose.
A Pounds 5.2m gain on disposals was offset by a further Pounds 7m of
rationalisation costs.
Business services - comprising cleaning, personnel, security, catering and
facilities management - saw sales increase 2 per cent to Pounds 370m,
although operating profit fell 14 per cent to Pounds 11m.
Distribution services increased operating profit by 19 per cent to Pounds
15.6m, led by the US tanker and Zimbabwean distribution businesses.
Plant services increased operating profit by 13 per cent to Pounds 20.5m,
excluding asset write-offs in the prior year. Turnover fell by 9 per cent to
Pounds 190m.
Turnover from textile services fell 2 per cent to Pounds 119m and operating
profit was down 10 per cent to Pounds 17.2m.
COMMENT
Mr Clark gets credit in the City for stabilising BET, which overstretched
itself by a series of acquisitions in the 1980s. The question is: where does
it go from here? Since the chief executive joined in 1991, disposals and
rationalisations have reduced the group from 180 operating companies to 59
profit centres. Mr Clark is now talking about 'growth over time', which
suggests there will be no swift bounce in the group's performance. Forecast
full-year profits of Pounds 105m put the shares, up 3p yesterday to 114 1/2
p, on a prospective multiple of 13.5 - a small discount to the market. The
shares are unlikely to move significantly unless and until BET demonstrates
that its remaining businesses really can deliver improved productivity and
profits.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Sainsbury held to 6.5% rise: Plans for new superstores
curbed by tougher planning restrictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, said yesterday that tougher
government planning restrictions were starting to bite, and it expected to
open only 12 new supermarkets next year compared with plans for 20.
Speaking the day after the Commons environment committee called for tighter
restrictions on out-of-town retail development, Mr David Sainsbury,
chairman, reported a 6.5 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 444.3m from Pounds 417.2m. Last year's figure was restated to take
account of new depreciation policies.
Mr Sainsbury said the group had won only one out of nine planning appeals
this year, and spent Pounds 182m in the first half on new stores, compared
with Pounds 309m in the same period last year.
'The difficulty of obtaining planning consent on appeal has become extreme,'
he said. 'That has also led to greater difficulty in negotiating consent
with local authorities. We do not foresee a reversal of this situation in
the near future.'
Spending on new UK superstores in the full year is expected to be little
more than Pounds 300m. Twenty stores will be built this year, but the number
will fall to 12 next year.
However, Sainsbury will spend more than Pounds 100m on refurbishing and
extending older stores, and Pounds 150m on developing other divisions than
its core UK supermarket chain.
'We would prefer to invest in other opportunities rather than acquire
sub-standard sites (for supermarkets) with lower returns,' Mr Sainsbury
said.
Sainsbury last month acquired 50 per cent of voting shares in Giant Food,
the Washington DC-based supermarket group, and expects Giant's profits to
outweigh financing costs this year. Its existing US business, Shaw's,
increased operating profits 44 per cent to Dollars 36.3m (Pounds 24m).
With a strong performance from the DIY chain Homebase - where profits grew
34 per cent - the other divisions increased operating profits 26 per cent to
Pounds 58.1m. That far outpaced the 7.7 per cent rise in UK supermarket
profits to Pounds 405m.
Total UK supermarket sales increased 7.7 per cent, of which 7.3 points came
from new space. Like-for-like sales volumes, excluding new space, increased
1 per cent, with price deflation of 0.6 per cent.
The fall in prices was partly a result of Sainsbury's 'Essentials'
price-cutting campaign, which started a year ago, reduced gross margins by
0.2 percentage points. Mr Sainsbury said he believed the campaign had
neutralised the threat from low-priced discount competitors, and gross
margins could now be held.
Total group sales increased 8.2 per cent to Pounds 6.35bn from Pounds
5.87bn. Total UK sales grew 8.3 per cent to Pounds 5.61bn, while US sales
increased 7.2 per cent to Dollars 1.12bn (Pounds 735.7m).
Group operating profits increased to Pounds 463m from Pounds 421m.
The interim dividend was lifted to 3.2p from 3p, with fully diluted earnings
per share increasing to 15.93p from 15.45p.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Surge in tobacco profits lifts BAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge in tobacco profits in the US and recovery in Brazil helped BAT
Industries overcome weakness in its general insurance business to report a
21 per cent increase in third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 551m from
Pounds 455m.
The stronger than forecast result pushed profits for the nine months ended
September to Pounds 1.5bn, up 10 per cent from a year earlier. 'There should
be a worthwhile increase in our pre-tax profits for the year, enabling us to
maintain our progressive dividend policy,' Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman,
said.
BAT remained hopeful that a New York court would overturn attempts by the
Federal Trade Commission to block its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover of
American Tobacco. The FTC will argue in the case, beginning in New York on
December 5, that the deal would reduce competition. Tobacco trading profits
for the nine months rose 13 per cent to Pounds 920m, excluding a Pounds 135m
extraordinary gain a year earlier. Cigarette volumes rose by 5 per cent.
In the US, third-quarter profits at its Brown &amp; Williamson subsidiary nearly
trebled to Pounds 111m and doubled in the nine months to Pounds 328m.
US profits were depressed last year by Philip Morris' savage price cutting
on 'Marlboro Friday'. Since then the market has stabilised with Kool and GPC
Approved, BAT's leading brands, improving their market shares.
Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said the jump in US profits reflected
special factors but there was good underlying growth.
Financial services contributed Pounds 674m to group trading profits, up 3
per cent from a year earlier. Eagle Star's profits fell Pounds 13m to Pounds
104m because of a sharp drop in investment returns to Pounds 99m. Its
underwriting loss fell to Pounds 28m from Pounds 99m.
Allied Dunbar, BAT's UK financial services business, raised its trading
profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 124m on premium income up 10 per cent at
Pounds 1.32bn.
Farmers, BAT's US insurer, showed a marginal increase in profits to Pounds
391m with its life business improving in the quarter. BAT said Farmers'
claims from last year's San Francisco earthquake were expected to exceed
earlier estimates of Dollars 1.35bn.
A 16 per cent increase in nine-months tax to Pounds 466m and an increase in
minority interests to Pounds 83m from Pounds 71m left earnings per share
ahead 6 per cent at 30.8p.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Prudential seeks custodian for Pounds 40bn of assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, has asked 10 leading
international banks to bid for its global custody business, which holds
Pounds 40bn in UK and international securities. This follows the Pru's
decision to act no longer as its own custodian for securities.
Mr David Hanson, a director at Prudential Portfolio Managers, said that the
company was concerned that it would have to make significant investments in
technology to maintain standards in its custody service.
The move is a part of a growing trend among international fund managers to
focus activities on their core businesses and contract out administrative
services. It would be the largest individual global custody contract to be
awarded since the State of California sought tenders three years ago for its
assets of Dollars 80bn (Pounds 51bn).
Mr Hanson declined to name the banks which had been asked to present
proposals. However, it is believed the list includes Chase Manhattan Bank,
Citibank, Barclays Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Midland Bank. The banks,
which have received the offer, have five weeks to prepare submissions.
Custody is the broad term applied to the safe-keeping and record-keeping of
funds. It generally includes the provision of cash management, foreign
exchange facilities and securities lending. For leading international banks,
the provision of custody - part of transactions banking - is a significant
contributor to profits.
Banks have invested heavily in technology to improve the services they
provide to fund management clients and the Pru would have to make similar
investments, Mr Hanson said. 'You would have to justify that spend, and that
makes you pause. I'm not sure that custody is our business.' he said.
However, he said the in-house custody service was meeting present needs.
Prudential has been its own custodian for its UK domestic securities
portfolio and has used three other banks for the custody of its UK gilts and
non-domestic securities, which are invested from London. It also manages
Pounds 35bn in assets which are held with custodians in other regions.
Prudential is not seeking new custodians for these funds.
Mr Hanson said changes in the way the Pru managed funds were partly
responsible for the decision. In the past 10 years the Pru has begun to
manage money from centres in North America, Australasia and east Asia,
increasing its need for a global custodian. He added that the Pru had begun
to retain custodians in each region.
Regulatory changes, including the introduction of a new accounting standard
for custodians, the advent of the Crest paperless share settlement system in
London and the possibility of new UK regulations had made it consider its
position.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Quaker buys 'new age' drinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Quaker Oats, the US food and beverage group, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.7bn
(Pounds 1.07bn) in cash to acquire Snapple Beverage, a company that has
changed the shape of the US soft drinks market with its 'new age' iced teas
and fruit-flavoured drinks.
Quaker also said it would seek buyers for its European petfood business,
which makes Felix catfood and Fido dogfood, and its Mexican confectionery
arm which produces La Azteca chocolate.
Snapple, based in Valley Stream, Long Island, has grown rapidly in the US by
selling bottled drinks that appeal to an increasingly health-conscious
public. Annual sales shot up to Dollars 516m last year from Dollars 44m in
1990. Recently, however, Snapple's profits and share price have been hit by
the cost of geographical expansion and by competition from companies such as
Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, which have jumped on to the alternative beverage
bandwagon. Snapple said net profits had sunk from Dollars 26.9m to Dollars
7.1m in the quarter to September.
Chicago-based Quaker Oats, for many months the subject of bid speculation,
has been under pressure to realign its businesses because of lacklustre
financial performance. Last week it reported a fall in net income from
Dollars 91.4m to Dollars 57.3m in the quarter to September, blaming weakness
in European petfood sales and increased marketing costs, especially for its
Gatorade sports drinks in North America.
Mr William Smithburg, Quaker chairman and chief executive, said the
combination of Gatorade and Snapple would create North America's largest
'good-for-you' beverage company, with market leadership in teas, juice
drinks and sports drinks.
He said the petfood and chocolate disposals would concentrate Quaker on
faster-growing, higher-margin businesses. The European petfoods business has
annual revenues of about Dollars 800m and Mexican chocolate has annual
revenues of about Dollars 100m. Mr Les Pugh, an analyst at Salomon Brothers,

Dollars 700m. He cited Nestle, the biggest European food company, as a
possible buyer.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Funds fuel the fashion for metal: A look back on a year of
price rebounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week last year base metal prices were at an all-time low. Now prices
have rebounded with aluminium and copper, the two most heavily-traded
metals, up by more than 70 per cent.
Analysts suggest that prices have run well ahead of what can be justified by
fundamental factors such as the balance of supply and demand. Stocks remain
high, twice the normal level in the case of aluminium.
But an important new element is fuelling price rises: the activity of banks
and investment funds.
The funds are estimated to have put Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10bn) into metals
so far this year. Meanwhile, the banks probably control 75 per cent of the
London Metal Exchange stocks - traders say that as much as 85 per cent of
the LME's aluminium stock is controlled by four or five banks.
Consumers are complaining, particularly the Japanese, the biggest users of
metals markets. Mr Kenichi Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Aluminium
Federation, said he had little faith in a market, such as the LME, which
could be influenced by speculators.
Producers, many of whom were almost suicidal a year ago, do not
wholeheartedly welcome the new element in the metals markets either. High
prices encourage substitution of other materials for metals and volatile
prices frighten off potential metals users. Also, producers are likely to
use the futures markets to lock in artificially high prices either to fund
further development or to bolster flagging operations - moves that might
bloat future supply.
There is general concern among metal markets users about what happens next.
Many share the view of Mr Robin Adams, president of the Resource Strategies
consultancy, who says the funds' involvement is 'a fashion craze' and
'financial fashions like real estate investment trusts, loans to Third World
dictators and junk bonds, always end in tears'.
Nevertheless, there are apparently good reasons for the banks and funds'
involvement. Banks, for example, took advantage of cheap money to buy up
stocks of physical metal.
Mr Chris Harris of Barclays Metals describes how the system worked:
typically a bank borrowed one-year money at 5 per cent and used it to buy
aluminium at Dollars 1,200 a tonne. The bank negotiated special terms with a
warehouse to store the metal for one year at Dollars 52 a tonne. It sold the
metal forward at Dollars 1,315 a tonne to gain a Dollars 3 a tonne profit.
The volumes involved tended to be at least 250,000 tonnes per bank and two
big groups are believed to have tied up 800,000 tonnes each.
Investment managers, meanwhile, say interest in metals has boomed because
clients wanted to reduce their portfolio risk through asset diversification
and hedge against unexpected inflation. Commodities are being touted as a
new asset class to compete with bonds, equities and property. But many
analysts are sceptical. 'Those three assets offer a running return in
addition to the possible capital gain,' says Mr Robert Davies, mining
analyst at London stockbrokers, Smith New Court. 'Interest, dividend and
rental income from the three traditional asset classes give them a long-term
value that is totally lacking in commodities. Base metals are mined to be
consumed.'
He suggests the main reason for the funds' dive into metals was that 'in an
effort to achieve better returns than were possible on bonds and equities,
some funds chased esoteric investments, including commodities'.
Whatever the reason for their involvement, the funds have certainly had an
impact on metals prices. During the last cyclical recovery, between 1984 and
1987, metal stocks fell for two years before prices started rising
appreciably. This time prices started moving upwards six months before
stocks began to fall.
Mr Nick Mason, analyst at the CRU International consultancy, says metals
prices are now behaving more like financial instruments and anticipating or
leading actual fundamental developments. 'The important question for future
metals prices is to what extend will the market anticipate the next major
shift in the fundamentals. It would not be surprising if prices begin to
reflect this expectation as early as the begining of next year.'
The consensus is that the funds will unwind their positions in the metals
markets gradually so as to avoid any self-inflicted damage to their profits.
The hope is that this will take place coincidentally with a surge in metals
demand in line with a global economic recovery.
Some suggest the funds' timing so far has been perfect and there are solid
reasons underlying recent price rises. Mr Wiktor Bielski, metals analyst at
Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, points out that demand for aluminium,
copper and nickel rose 7 per cent in the first half of 1994 against the same
period last year, while lead and zinc demand was up by 4 per cent.
Meanwhile, supplies have fallen along with exports from the former eastern
bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Some producers have had to buy metal
on the LME to cover commitments.
Ms Rhona O'Connell at T. Hoare &amp; Co, London stockbrokers, admits there is
always the possibility that the funds might all sell at once if the herd
instinct takes over. However, 'the diversity of fund participation and its
raison d'etre is such that the funds will not kill the markets that they
have helped to rejuvenate. The downside, though, is that the acceleration of
supply caused by artificially high prices may also mean that the troughs
will be at lower price levels than would otherwise had been the case. On
this basis, one could argue that the funds have not actually helped the
metals' cause at all.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Food group's offices raided in pirated software inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investigators checking allegations of illegal computer software use have
raided the UK offices of a number of subsidiaries of Nutricia, the Dutch
foods group, including the baby foods maker Cow &amp; Gate. Unigate, the UK milk
producer, has a 34 per cent stake in Nutricia.
The Business Software Alliance, which represents the world's leading
personal computer manufacturers, secured a High Court writ leading to an
order which enabled its investigators to search the offices of Cow &amp; Gate,
Galenco and Nutricia Dietary Products.
The search took place in the past few weeks after claims that pirated
software was being used. Under software protection laws, penalties can
include prison sentences of up to two years for executives of offending
companies.
It is understood that the organisation queried the legality of software
being used on between 100 and 200 personal computers found at Cow &amp; Gate.
The company has until Friday this week to produce licences for all the
software being used on its premises.
The software companies involved in the complaint, Adobe, Lotus, Microsoft
and the networking company Novell are seeking injunctions preventing the
companies from infringing their copyright and demanding that all copied
software be handed over.
The software alliance rarely presses for the full legal penalties to be
exacted but will be looking for damages for lost revenue. It is more
concerned to persuade companies to obey the law than to send executives to
jail.
It has become increasingly aggressive in recent months, however, in pressing
for action against companies which make use of illegal software, arguing
that nobody should now be in ignorance of the law.
It says that losses exceeded Pounds 300m last year in the UK industry alone.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Guardian faces probe by MPs over fake fax: No early move on
Benn's breach of rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Guardian's use of a fake fax to investigate Mr Jonathan Aitken's stay at
the Paris Ritz was yesterday referred to both the police and the powerful
Commons privileges committee.
Amid fresh allegations about the business activities of Mr Aitken, Treasury
chief secretary, Downing Street confirmed that Mr John Major, the prime
minister, knew about the fake fax nearly six months ago, but took no action.
It also emerged that no immediate action will be taken against Mr Tony Benn,
the former Labour cabinet minister, who broke Commons rules on Tuesday by
releasing confidential details of a privileges committee meeting. The
committee was investigating allegations that two Conservative MPs were
prepared to take cash for tabling parliamentary questions.
After a rancorous debate marked by Conservative allegations of theft and
fraud against Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, MPs voted for a
privileges committee inquiry by 313 to 38, a majority of 275.
Mr Preston, who has admitted using the Commons logo on a letter to the Ritz
seeking details of Mr Aitken's bill, will be called before the committee in
the next parliamentary session. He said that The Guardian had sent the fake
fax to acquire a documentary basis for questions about Mr Aitken's
behaviour. 'We could not sit on it because something unpleasant might be
done to us,' he said on Channel Four news.
Mr David Wilshire, the Conservative MP whose complaint prompted the debate,
said he had also asked the police to investigate Mr Preston's 'criminal' use
of the logo.
MPs on both sides also made repeated allegations against Mr Mohamed Fayed,
owner of the Ritz, who was The Guardian's chief source for allegations of
impropriety against Mr Aitken.
Mr Wilshire accused Mr Preston and Mr Fayed of involvement in 'a criminal
conspiracy'. Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour backbencher, described Mr Fayed as
'pathologically corrupt'.
Downing Street confirmed claims by Mr Fayed that Mr Major and Sir Robin
Butler, cabinet secretary, were aware of the faked fax in May, but took no
action.
Officials said Mr Major viewed The Guardian's action as 'reprehensible', but
told Mr Aitken that it was up to him to take action against Mr Preston. if
he wished.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ruled that calls for Mr Benn's expulsion
from the committee could not be debated until after its next meeting on
November 21.
Mr Aitken denied allegations in the Daily Mirror that he was involved in
undeclared deals that gave control of the TV-am television station to Saudi
investors.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Base rate rise 'on hold' after monetary meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK bank base rates appeared last night to be on hold for this month after
yesterday's monthly monetary meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England.
But higher interest rates in the months ahead remained a possibility after
both men, in public comments before and after their 45-minute discussion,
emphasised their commitment to low inflation as the best way to promote UK
economic growth, competitiveness and job creation.
Mr Clarke, in an interview with BBC radio's Today programme, made clear
early yesterday that he and Mr George were at one in wanting underlying
inflation, which excludes mortgage interest rates below 2.5 per cent by the
end of this parliament.
Mr George, giving a lecture on unemployment last night, told a City audience
that 'timely - and in the end, smaller - increases in interest rates' were
less likely to damage investment and industrial confidence than inflation.
Neither the bank nor the Treasury would comment on the meeting. However, it
is believed that Mr George did not press for an increase in interest rates
this month. As the governor has been more insistent than the chancellor on
the need for timely interest rate increases in recent months, it was assumed
that yesterday's meeting decided to keep base rates at 5.75 per cent.
The bank this week indicated that base rates would probably have to rise
over the coming months. It detected a generally improved inflation outlook
over the next two years, but warned of the danger of stronger price
pressures. Nevertheless, its quarterly inflation report, published on
Tuesday, shied away from advocating an immediate rate rise. Instead it
concluded: 'It will be necessary to monitor these developments very
carefully.'
The Treasury's monthly monetary report, prepared for yesterday's meeting,
listed the economic factors that might argue for or against a tightening of
monetary policy. They remain finely balanced.
The Treasury said underlying inflation fell to a new 27-year low in
September. However, it added that monthly indicators of economic activity
'supported a picture of broadly based growth'.
Mr Clarke made clear that he and the bank agreed on the need for low
inflation. 'I am as keen on it as the governor of the Bank of England,' said
Mr Clarke, referring to the government's target of having inflation in the
bottom half of its 1-4 per cent range by the end of this parliament.

FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Yen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The other side to the dollar's weakness is the continuing strength of the
yen. Neither country is happy with the situation. While the US Federal
Reserve waded into currency markets yesterday for the first time in many
months, the Bank of Japan's intervention in currency markets has become
increasingly frenetic. But buying dollars and selling yen alone will achieve
little.
Changes in monetary policy are needed in both countries. The Fed's approach
to raising interest rates has been dilatory. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan's
governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, who retires next month, has been giving the
economy a valedictory twist of the monetary screw. Short-term market rates
have been nudged upwards in the last few months and long-term rates have
joined the global surge.
The monetary stance is inappropriate. Japan's economy remains mired in the
foothills of a painfully slow recovery. Despite the still low nominal
interest rates, prices are falling fast - consumer prices dropped by 1.6 per
cent in the three months to August. Real interest rates have risen by more
than 1.5 percentage points in the past year. The risk of a deflationary
spiral remains real, magnified by the threat from a still-precarious
financial system. The trade surplus may at last have started to decline, but
that alone will not prevent the yen rising yet higher. On current policy,
Japanese investors see little reason to reverse the repatriation of their
investments that has been at the heart of the currency's strength for so
long.

FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Snapple
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Snapple's headlong rush into the arms of Quaker Oats is logical. Sales
growth at the new-age fruit juice company remains heady, but the group is
facing stiff competition from the likes of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestle.
Margins are being squeezed and the company has been forced to raise
marketing expenditure. Snapple needs to internationalise but, on its own,
has neither the necessary financial nor management resources to do so
quickly. Quaker should provide the extra resources as well as access to its
distribution system.
By acquiring Snapple, Quaker is staking its claim to become a significant
competitor in the soft-drink industry. The company already markets Gatorade,
the top-selling US sports drink which it is beginning to push into Europe.
But Quaker is paying a steep price for access to the new-age soft drinks
sector, the fastest-growing part of the beverage market. The Dollars
14-a-share offer may be well below Snapple's peak of Dollars 31 in February,
but it still represents a multiple of 38 times expected 1994 earnings. The
deal will be dilutive for at least two years.
Quaker plans to pay for the deal, at least in part, by selling its European
pet food business, the region's second largest. Both Nestle and Dalgety, the
next biggest competitors, would probably want it. But the Swiss group must
be favourite. Dalgety is already distracted, trying to buy Allied Domecq's
food ingredients business. Besides, Nestle has the deeper pockets.

FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT is up to its eyeballs in regulators. In UK financial services, it faces
a new disclosure regime and the costs of untangling the personal pensions
fiasco. In US financial services, the Californian insurance reform movement
has come back to haunt it. In tobacco, where the US anti-smoking lobby is
getting ever more vociferous, BAT is now fighting to save its Dollars 1bn
bid for American Tobacco from an anti-trust challenge. A normal company
might start to feel persecuted. But suppliers of cigarettes and life
assurance do not expect to be loved.
Not that the regulatory pressure is all bad. While the personal pensions
disaster has done little to dent BAT's new life and investment business, it
can only hasten consolidation in the industry and BAT has the money to spend
on fire sales. On the cigarette side, the blocking of the attractive
American Tobacco deal would be a blow. But at least the threat of an excise
duty hike has receded for the moment.
Nevertheless, the thickness of the regulatory jungle is tending to obscure
BAT's healthy trading picture. The shares slipped yesterday despite the
resilient financial services profits and strong recovery from the US
cigarette business. At this rate, BAT will be more than justified in
matching the 8 per cent interim dividend increase at the final stage, so
pushing the yield to 6.3 per cent. That looks cheap even by the standards of
other tobacco stocks. Whether it takes full account of the regulatory and
legal risks is another question.

FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Discounters at bay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury has seen off the immediate threat from the discount
supermarkets. The victory has been achieved at the price of a painful
reduction in gross margins, the group conceded yesterday. But fears of a
profits implosion, which have lingered on since the traumatic fall in
Sainsbury's share price early this year, now look overdone. The discounters
themselves are not in a fit state to launch a fresh assault on prices, as
Kwik Save's figures are expected to demonstrate today. Against this
background, gross margins at Sainsbury should stabilise from here on.
The group's rigour in holding down costs in its core UK food retailing
business was impressive. Equally so, from a strategic as well as a financial
point of view, was the contribution made by Sainsbury's other retailing
activities. Operating profits here grew by more than a quarter, lifting the
total growth in group operating profits to 10 per cent - well ahead of the
7.7 per cent increase achieved by Sainsbury's UK supermarkets alone. The
group's diversification strategy, which took a further stride forward last
month with the acquisition of a 50 per cent voting stake in Giant Food of
the US, has proved successful in insulating profits from the full ravages of
competition in UK food retailing.
One gripe is that the dividend grew by only 6.7 per cent, in line with
pre-tax profits which were held back by a high interest charge. Sainsbury
should consider moving to a progressive dividend policy. So robust is its
cash flow that it could clearly afford to do so. But Sainsbury is probably
husbanding its cash for further diversification in the US.

Dean died at 24 in a 1955 car crash. As elsewhere, he is a popular icon in

But in what is turning into a rebel without a corset clash, the US-based
Curtis Management Group, representing the family and estate of the deceased

Expensive business, trademark actions. Far cheaper surely to turn the other

One of Shaftesbury Avenue's leading theatres - the Globe - has become the
Gielgud, in honour of Sir John Gielgud's 90th birthday. Sir John was in
commanding form as he accepted the honour yesterday: 'In recent years I've
gone down Shaftesbury Avenue many times and not recognised any of the names
on the theatres. Now at least I recognise one.'
He was particularly happy because he has been involved in 15 productions
there - including Hamlet 60 years ago; and his sister worked in its box
office 50 years ago.
Janet Holmes-a-Court, whose Stoll Moss chain includes the Gielgud, was happy
to spend Pounds 25,000 to change the theatre's sign and place Sir John's
photograph, by Lord Snowdon, in the foyer.
Few actors' names grace a London theatre. There is the Garrick; the Olivier,
at the National; and, if you include actor-managers, the Wyndham. Sir John
would like one more - for his old sparring partner Sir Ralph Richardson.

The clamour for open government has even reached the hallowed portals of the
Bank of England, which faced criticism yesterday from City analysts
complaining about 'misleading signals' associated with Wednesday's inflation
report. Analysts felt the report suggested there would be no rise in rates;
newspapers yesterday speculated a rise was due in the coming months.
One economist, quoted by Reuters, took a firm line. The Bank's tactics, he
thundered, were 'hardly an open and transparent way of conveying monetary
policy messages'.
Who was this seeker of truth and light? Who knows? The economist spoke on
condition of anonymity.

Hard to get the measure of Jennifer D'Abo, whose resignation from the
Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board has caused such a stir.
Some regard her as a female Bertie Wooster who wears heart-shaped glasses
and calls everybody 'Dahling'. Others regard this as a disguise for an
extremely astute businesswoman who is quick to spot money-making
opportunities but tends to flit around, the sort who sparks larger-than-life
stories.
One of Observer's favourites involves a visitor to her house on the Duke of
Marlborough's Blenheim estate, who found his way blocked by giant gates.
Luckily, he had a mobile phone and was able to contact D'Abo - who jumped
into Miss Mink, as she called her black Mercedes, and raced down the
two-mile long drive to let in her dinner guest.

When will the UK Forestry Commission get a chairman? Two months after the
retirement of Sir Raymond Johnstone, 65, on the expiry of his five-year
term, it's still lacking a leader.
Two of the three forestry ministers - Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, and
William Waldegrave, agriculture minister - favour Sir Peter Hutchison to
take over. Sir Peter, 59, is a Scottish baronet who chairs a family
insurance broker in Glasgow and is vice-chairman of British Waterways.
But the third minister - John Redwood, Welsh secretary - fears Hutchison
might favour green as opposed to commercial forestry as much as Johnstone
did. Redwood might be right; Hutchison is a former chairman of the trustees
of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh and gives talks on his
plant-hunting expeditions in Asia.
Redwood was thwarted earlier this year in his desire to have the Commission
privatised. Has he lost another fight?

Bob Bauman, former chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, may have been
known as 'Mr Restructuring' in the drugs industry, but British Aerospace
shareholders were left wondering yesterday whether he needed some
restructuring himself, after getting rather mixed-up about BAe's bid for
submarine-maker VSEL.
Urging shareholders to back the group's bid for the Barrow-based
shipbuilder, BAe's new two-day-a-week chairman said the offer was worth
'Dollars 14 a share'.
'You mean pounds, not dollars,' shouted one investor from the back of the
ballroom. Hardly had he corrected himself, when another shareholder put him
right again. 'GEC has bid Pounds 14 a share, not BAe.'
Apologising, the mastermind of the Beecham and SmithKline Beckman merger
quipped 'this was my first time at this sort of thing'. But not the last,
eh?

FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Avoiding postal fudge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has got itself into an extraordinary tangle over its plans to
privatise the Post Office. But the problems are of its own making, and it
could cut the Gordian knot if only the Treasury would adopt a less blinkered
attitude than it has until now.
The issue is simple: can the Post Office be freed from Treasury control if
the government continues to hold a large majority stake in the business? Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has been telling Tory MPs
that the Treasury will not loosen its grip unless a majority stake is in the
private sector, because of rules about the compilation of the public
accounts and concerns about the ultimate liability for the debts of a
privatised Post Office.
It appears the Treasury might, after all, be prepared to countenance a
relaxation of control if the state share were limited to 51 per cent. But
even that may not be enough for discontented Tory MPs, anxious to avoid
confronting electors with a cause as unpopular as selling off the Royal
Mail.
Opposition to postal privatisation is motivated mostly by ignorance or by
wilful misrepresentation. Concerns over the future of village and high
street post offices have been met by government guarantees to retain the
Post Office's counters division in the public sector. A postal regulator
would be charged with controlling stamp prices and protecting universal
collections and deliveries. On the experience of British Telecommunications,
a regulator would very likely do a better job of defending consumers than
does the government now.
Yet allowing for the political position, an obvious course suggests itself
provided the Treasury is prepared to show the necessary flexibility. The
Post Office should be constituted as a public limited company. Only a small
minority of the share capital - say 10 to 20 per cent - would be sold off,
but a statutory bar would be placed on state aid, and the government would
give a statutory commitment to exercise no more than the ordinary rights of
a majority shareholder to receive dividends and control broad strategy. The
Treasury should then let the Post Office operate freely.
Treasury theologians will doubtless shake their heads, but such a policy may
be the best way forward in the circumstances. The Post Office is a
profitable enterprise, and has been run on business lines for more than a
decade. It is not, therefore, a precedent to free the few other remaining
public sector enterprises from the Treasury's control.
Of course, the government's commitment not to rescue a failing Post Office
is only as good as its statutory word. But equally, the state can use - and
in the past has used - its power to rescue failing private companies, so the
same argument could apply to any strategic industry. In practical terms,
granting the Post Office freedom to develop its national and international
business is less likely to lead to reliance on the taxpayer than is a
continuation of the status quo.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Swan song
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Today an era ends on Tyneside, when the HMS Richmond, the last of 2,700
ships built by the 134-year-old Swan Hunter shipyard, leaves the river. Next
week it will be handed over to the Royal Navy. Its departure from the
Wallsend yard signals the company's closure and the probable end of
shipbuilding on the Tyne.
Swans has been in receivership since May 1993, and the closure of the
north-east's last shipbuilding yard is hardly a surprise. But it is
nonetheless of great symbolic importance: it underlines the region's decline
over a century as one of the world's leading centres of heavy industry.
Of more practical consequence, the closure will cost jobs in an area with
the highest regional unemployment rate on the British mainland. Swan Hunter
employed 2,400 people when it went into receivership; it now has only 400
left, most of whom will go within days, although sales of subsidiaries have
preserved some jobs.
Those losing their livelihoods might well ask why the government has seen
fit to use public funds to attract inward investment to the region, such as
the electronics factory opened by Samsung, but would not prop up Swan
Hunter.
The sums should be kept in perspective; while the region is economically
depressed, it will continue to receive large transfers from central
government in the form of unemployment benefits, which dwarf the industrial
subsidies in question.
That point made, the government's strategy in backing Samsung not Swans is
right. The Samsung project, which could bring 3,000 jobs to the region, has
received Pounds 80m out of the Pounds 450m total cost of the project in
government and regional subsidies. However electronics is a growth industry,
and the record of inward investment in providing training, jobs and growth
is good, particularly in the north-east, which prides itself on being the
magnet within the UK for far eastern manufacturing investment.
No such case could be made for Swan Hunter. It has been increasingly
dependent on military work, a dwindling market. Moreover, the cost-plus
basis of many contracts has encouraged a high-quality but high-cost culture
ill-suited to the demands of world competition.
While shipbuilding is clearly not dying worldwide, civil orders are pursued
ferociously by South Korea and Japan; indeed the OECD has warned that
planned Korean expansion could lead to overcapacity and international
price-cutting wars. It is far from clear that subsidising Swan Hunter would
have enabled it to compete. France, which has subsidised its industry
heavily and has threatened to veto limits on such aids agreed in the OECD
this summer, has nonetheless seen its industry decline.
The north-east's record in attracting inward investment is admirable. That
is of more future value than propping up dying symbols of its past success.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A bank for peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Casablanca conference on Middle East economic development has played a
valuable role in dismantling psychological barriers. It also came up with a
concrete proposal to that end, in agreeing to work towards the creation of a
regional development bank. Pan-regional economic institutions - on trade,
for example, and water - will be essential if peace is to be consolidated
and trust built between ancient enemies. It is questionable, however,
whether a bank is the best means to that end.
Putting flesh on the bare bones of the proposed Middle East and North Africa
Development Bank, and achieving a funding target of Dollars 10bn, will prove
challenging. The yet to be selected 'group of experts' who will examine
policy options for the bank should look closely at the chequered history of
others in Asia, Africa and the Americas. One obvious lesson is that regional
development banks have fared best when operating in relatively well-managed
economies where project lending might have a better than average chance of
proving profitable.
The experience of the African Development Bank shows how difficult this can
be. At the end of last year, over 39 per cent of its outstanding loans were
to just four countries: Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria, the last two
scarcely models of third world development. The percentage of loans going to
the north of the continent is predicted to increase as investment
opportunities decrease in sub-Saharan Africa. Significantly, those four
countries would expect to be members of, and beneficiaries from, the new
bank, an unnecessary duplication which cannot be left unresolved. Similar
problems exist with the potentially overlapping activities of the Arab Fund
for Economic and Social Development and the Islamic Development Bank - not
to mention the World Bank itself.
The management of any new bank would need simultaneously to make Herculean
efforts to loosen the link in the Middle East between politics and economic
assistance. Arab countries bordering Israel have long been rewarded by one
paymaster or another, according to political stance, not to economic
performance. Israel still enjoys substantial and largely uncritical US
assistance, while the Palestine Liberation Organisation is already showing
all the symptoms of the aid addict in its demands for unfettered cash
assistance.
Regional governments will continue to emphasise the threat of Islamic
extremism in an effort to ensure that political aid is not reduced. But it
has been the very failure of those regimes to manage their economies
efficiently which has created the conditions in which extremism flourishes.
It is welcome that Middle Eastern governments are discussing ways in which
they can work together. But a bank along the lines suggested is not the best
form of co-operation - and certainly should not be the only one.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Personal View: Europe - the spectre of budget deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the last few months the majority of economic forecasters have been
forced to raise their predictions for Europe's growth in 1994. It would seem
natural to assume that there is a common factor behind this 'surprising'
growth, but this appears not to be the case.
The German economic recovery has been brought about by a combination of
buoyant corporate sector spending and a fall in the personal sector's
savings rate. Both factors can be attributed to an accumulation of money
balances in each sector, which has led both individuals and companies to
spend more.
It is no coincidence that the recovery has followed a period of above-trend
monetary growth. Most of the hallmarks of monetary expansion are present:
the current account balance has deteriorated as the national savings rate
has fallen, equity prices have risen, and the yield curve has steepened.
This German monetary expansion is partly due to the Bundesbank's action in
adding liquidity to the economy when defending the exchange rate mechanism
last year. It is also the product of rapid growth in domestic credit, mainly
in lending to the public sector to fund Germany's budget deficit.
Over the last three years, bank lending to the public sector has accounted
for between a third and half of the growth in broad money. The banking
system has effectively been creating money to finance the budget deficit and
this has been spent in the domestic economy, stimulating recovery.
Outside Germany, budget deficits have also played a part in economic
recovery. According to OECD figures, the French budget deficit grew by the
equivalent of 2 per cent of gross domestic product last year. This year, it
is expected that aggregate GDP will rise by a similar amount.
Similarly, Sweden raised its budget deficit by more than 5 per cent of GDP
last year but seems likely to generate economic growth of only 3 per cent
this year. While these countries have seen economic recovery, the price
appears to have been large budget deficit increases.
Over the past decade, many have become blase about budget deficits. In this
world of freely flowing capital, few would claim that any given budget
deficit could not be financed. Unfortunately, when it requires real interest
rates of more than 5 per cent, the stock of debt is compounding at twice the
rate the economies themselves are capable of growing.
It seems surprising that this arithmetic attracts such scant attention given
its implications for tax rates, inflation and interest rates in the future.
Public indebtedness is now growing so fast that one is left wondering where
the income will eventually come from to service it.
Furthermore, if one were to add the problem of Europe's frequently unfunded
public pensions, the debt arithmetic becomes quite impossible. Present
fiscal trends leave many European states effectively no hope of fulfilling
their public pension commitments in the future.
Perhaps more worrying for this generation of Europeans is the effect current
budget deficits are having on Europe's economic structure.
Many countries in the exchange rate mechanism cannot allow their budget
deficits to be funded by the banking system as in Germany. Such de facto
easing of monetary conditions would clearly be incompatible with maintaining
their exchange rates in the ERM.
Instead, the budget deficits of France and other countries have to be funded
by borrowing from the other sectors of the economy, especially since
foreigners have started to sell European bonds in significant quantities.
Given the high real interest rates on offer, it is not surprising that
French investors should find current bond rates attractive. But there is
evidence that French companies are foregoing capital spending and employment
creation to invest in bonds.
This surely cannot be a sustainable state of affairs. High real interest
rates and low domestic rates of return on private investment are allowing
the budget deficits to crowd out more productive forms of fund raising. If
this continues, Europe could undergo a further loss of competitiveness and a
consequent decline in its long-run growth prospects.
Europe must address its budget deficits quickly. In Germany, the
persistently high monetary growth rate will eventually force the Bundesbank
to raise interest rates to cool the economy.
In other EU countries, large budget deficits are not only generating an
unfortunate legacy for our heirs, they are distorting the economies and will
make Europe less able to compete internationally.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Unlikely champion of free trade: Suharto's protectionist
instincts make Indonesia an improbable venue for the Apec summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, Indonesia is an improbable place to celebrate the virtues
of free trade. The economy has for years been one of the most protectionist
in south-east Asia.
The presidential palace in Bogor, near Jakarta, will nevertheless be the
venue for this month's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit, to
be attended by US President Bill Clinton and the leaders of 16 other Pacific
nations. If free traders have their way, the November 15 summit will set a
target date for free trade across the Pacific of 2020, or even 2010.
Mr Suharto sees the summit as the clearest sign yet of Indonesia's growing
stature on the world stage, and is determined to make it a success. He has
surprised even his own cabinet ministers with vigorous endorsements of free
trade in the run-up to the conference.
There has been a progressive liberalisation of Indonesia's trade and
investment regimes in recent years. Average tariffs, for example, have
fallen from 37 per cent to 20 per cent in the last decade. But the economy
remains protected with visible and invisible barriers and is ill-prepared to
compete in a free market.
Mr Suharto's sudden enthusiasm for free trade is typical of the enigmatic
army general, who has ruled with his 'New Order' government since 1966. The
president, who calls himself the 'Father of Development', has presided over
average annual economic growth of 6 per cent for the last quarter of a
century. Foreign investment in the world's fourth most populous nation, with
187m people, has been encouraged. Textiles, shoes and electronic goods have
joined timber, oil and gas as important exports industries.
The west has started to pay attention, with the US commerce department last
year proclaiming Indonesia a 'big emerging market'. Tempted by Indonesian
proposals to spend the equivalent of Dollars 50bn on everything from power
stations to telephones under its new five-year plan, the US has chosen
Jakarta as the first Asian site for a 'US Commercial Centre', to help US
investors and exporters.
In an Independence Day speech in August, Mr Suharto said Indonesia wanted to
quadruple real per capita income (at present about Dollars 800 a year) in
the next 25 years, through industrial development. 'We shall continue
deregulation and de-bureaucratisation,' he said. 'The goal is to prepare for
a highly competitive economy that can survive in the increasingly unified
and competitive global economy.'
However, he added a puzzling afterthought: 'Deregulation and
de-bureaucratisation certainly do not mean setting up a liberal economic
system that allows free competition.'
This inability to reconcile his professed belief in free enterprise with his
protectionist instincts, is one of several unresolved dilemmas in economics
and politics that confront Indonesia as the president grows older and the
economy larger.
Another is the domination of domestic business by conglomerates with ties of
blood or friendship to the Suharto family. The president has declined to
curb the commercial ambitions of his children or his small coterie of ethnic
Chinese business associates. Between them, they use their position to
acquire lucrative stakes in almost every big investment project.
Typical is the new Dollars 1.7bn Chandra Asri petrochemicals plant at Anyar,
on the west coast of Java. The partners in the project include Mr Bambang
Trihatmodjo, one of Mr Suharto's sons, and Mr Prajogo Pangestu, one of his
friends. The government has offered a 40 per cent tariff on imports to
support the venture, to the fury of some businessmen who fear the higher
costs will damage their competitiveness.
Another example of the arbitrary way Indonesia is run came to light in July,
when it emerged that Mr Suharto had decreed the transfer of Rp400bn (Pounds
113m) from a reforestation fund to IPTN, a state aircraft manufacturing
venture managed by Mr BJ Habibie, the minister of research and technology
and another friend of the president.
Environmentalists, including a prominent group called Walhi (Indonesian
Forum for the Environment), have taken the president to court, demanding the
reversal of the decree and asking for Mr Suharto to be fined Rp5m. 'A lot of
people warn us that, after Apec, Walhi will be harassed because of this
action,' said Ms Emmy Hafild of Walhi.
The acceptance by the court of the case for a hearing is attributed to the
official policy of keterbukaan or openness in recent years. But after a
brief period of vigorous debate in the media over politics and economics,
openness is already in retreat.
In June, the government banned three leading publications, apparently
because they mentioned the sensitive issue of the succession to Mr Suharto -
he has declined to name a successor or say if he will step down - and
reported on a dispute between the armed forces and Mr Habibie over his
decision to buy the 39 warships of the old East German navy.
Both Mr Suharto and the armed forces say strong government is needed to
control ethnic and religious conflicts and prevent the disintegration of
Indonesia - a scattered archipelago extending nearly 5,000km from Sumatra in
the west to Irian Jaya in the east. They do not believe a more open
political system is necessary to oversee the next stage of Indonesia's
industrial revolution.
The army's leading role in politics was tolerated and even welcomed by
Indonesians after the massacres surrounding the overthrow of President
Sukarno in 1966. Army chiefs are now unwilling to accept a diminished role
in an increasingly sophisticated, urbanised society.
General HBL Mantiri, chief of general staff, recently said the army saw
itself as the political 'shepherd' of Indonesians, and insisted it would
never relinquish the political and social role it has added to its military
responsibilities. 'Our dual function will last for ever and ever,' he
declared. 'It is already stated in the constitution.'
However, the argument that authoritarianism is necessary for stability is
not as compelling as it was in the 1960s. Strikes by workers have become
more frequent, and hardly a week passes without demonstrations by
slum-dwellers or rice farmers against well-connected property developers who
have gained control of their land.
The authorities have sought to crush the independent trade union that sprang
up in the past few years to represent workers in Indonesia's growing number
of factories. Mr Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the Indonesian Welfare Labour
Union, is now on trial, accused of inciting workers to riot in Sumatra in
April. Even before the trial is over, General Mantiri has said Mr Pakpahan
will get six years in jail because he organised in the factories 'and we
cannot tolerate such things, of course'. On Monday a fellow leader of the
union, Amosi Telaumbanua, was sentenced to 15 months in jail for inciting
worker riots.
The urban middle-class professionals who want democracy are few and
ineffective, but they grow more numerous every year as Indonesia becomes
wealthier. They are no more convinced than labourers of the need for
dissenting views to be silenced.
As the Apec summit approaches, local human rights campaigners, journalists
and environmentalists say harassment by police and military intelligence
officers has increased, presumably to discourage demonstrations.
Thousands of extra troops and police deployed in the capital for 'Operation
Cleansing' have rounded up prostitutes and beggars before the dignitaries
arrive.
Brushing aside criticism of its record on human rights and the environment -
in recent weeks vast fires in deforested areas of Indonesian Borneo and
Sumatra have shrouded Singapore and Malaysia in smoke - the government in
Jakarta portrays the Apec summit as an unambiguous sign that the country has
come of age.
There is a growing number of Indonesians, however, who believe that the
authoritarian government and corrupt bureaucracy are out of touch with the
views of ordinary Indonesians, and may prove incapable of taking the right
decisions to ensure continued political stability and economic growth. 'I
might have bought the argument of stability and authoritarianism in 1971 or
1972, but after all these years I don't buy it any more,' said Ms Hafild of
Walhi.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Information dazzle at the Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The danger of trying to look at too many signposts at the same time is that
the driver will be dazzled. This seems to have happened with Tuesday's Bank
of England Inflation Report.
The headline news about lower inflation, actual and expected, gave one
message to the markets. The warnings of the concluding section on the upward
risks to the forecast, which the Bank in the end decided to stress, gave
another. So the financial markets did not immediately realise the Bank was
trying to signal the need for a bias towards higher interest rates, whether
or not implemented this month.
These misunderstandings came from an attempt to be too pragmatic and flood
us all with information, which is valuable for the record, but needs to be
co-ordinated by a central vision. The source of the confusion is that the
upward pressures on both economic activity and prices have increased. But
they are being imposed on an economy operating at a lower rate of inflation
than anyone had dared to hope. Thus the aircraft is quite likely to be
buffeted by upward moving air currents; but it is starting from much nearer
the ground than the navigator previously realised.
The Bank's most favoured underlying measure of inflation, known in the trade
as RPIY, excludes indirect tax increases as well as mortgage interest
payments. On this basis inflation has been running at a seasonally adjusted
annualised rate of 1.7 per cent over the last three months. There are other
underlying indicators which give still more favourable results.
The risk of future upward inflation movements comes from the pressure of
output on productive capacity. One attempt to measure this pressure is to
look at the deviation of output from its trend, starting from the bottom of
the recession. The Bank's chart (not reproduced here) shows that, although
there is more unused capacity than at the corresponding period in the early
1980s, it is still being rapidly eroded. The Bank estimates that nominal GDP
is now rising by 5 per cent per annum, as I suggested on Monday. This is the
appropriate rate at which to aim, but not a basis for complacency when
subject to upward pressures coming especially from the prices component.
The crucial point is that the pressures on capacity are not confined to the
UK. They are being felt worldwide, outside Japan. One main channel of
transmission is through rising international commodity prices, which have
had the effect of boosting UK 'imported inflation' to 6 per cent per annum.
This is one reason why the balance of firms in CBI surveys expecting to
raise prices has reached 22 per cent, seasonally adjusted, the highest since
1990.
Another factor insufficiently stressed by the Bank is that, under the
influence of strengthening world markets and a highly competitive pound,
British producers are beginning to summon up the courage to pass on cost
increases in factory gate prices. There is no need to gaze at the crystal
ball. The chart shows that producer prices, excluding the food group, are
already rising at an annualised rate of 3.6 per cent.
So far, the upward forces at the producer level have been held at bay by
intense competition in UK retail markets. The Bank agonises over how long
this countervailing pressure will continue. But even if there has been a
structural change in the retail trade, the squeeze on margins is essentially
a one- off event which cannot be relied upon to hold down inflation in
future.
The Bank, which will have seen the Treasury's pre-Budget forecast, expects
the rise in output to slow down. It also emphasises the current near-zero
increases in unit wage costs. But the latter are already coming under threat
from the tightening labour markets and the tendency of productivity
increases to slow down as full capacity operation is approached. Above all
the Bank needs to put more emphasis on the interrelation between
unexpectedly rapid growth rates in different parts of the world. These are
understated by the overseas chapter in the November Bulletin, which does not
go beyond the inevitably dated official figures for countries outside the
UK.
The Inflation Report talks of the risk of inflation 'in two years' time'
going above its central forecast of 2 1/2 per cent. If this means a few
decimal points above, and that were to be the peak, no sensible chancellor
need lose sleep. The real risk is of a cumulative upward movement going much
higher and extending much longer. Then why not say so directly - instead of
in casuistical terms which can be easily demolished by the soft money
brigade, as the Bank was by The Times leader yesterday? The fragile nature
of the present low-inflation achievement is evident in the obstinate belief
of most wage earners that inflation will be stuck at 4 per cent for the
foreseeable future.
* * *
International Black Holes
One disadvantage of making the Inflation Report into a separate publication
is that it detracts attention from the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin, which
appears on the same day and often has fascinating information buried within
it.
One example is the table showing how loose is the connection between the
current balance of payments, about which some people fret so much, and the
net asset position of UK residents. In both 1992 and 1993 the UK had an
estimated current payments deficit averaging Pounds 10bn per annum. Yet the
net overseas assets of the UK rose in value by slightly more than these
sums. The same pattern has appeared so far in 1994 although with a much
lower deficit. In 1990 on the other hand there was a drop in identified net
assets three times as large as the payments deficit.
The main reason for these discrepancies is 'revaluations'. If there is a
rise in Wall Street, British holders of US securities will obviously gain. A
more paradoxical effect arises from currency changes. The UK had a very
large net gain in 1992 when sterling was devalued following its departure
from the ERM. The reason is that assets denominated in foreign currencies
then showed a large appreciation when converted into sterling.
The balance sheet benefits from devaluation are counter-intuitive. The only
way to get around them is to express net assets in a single external
currency such as dollars or as a proportion of GDP. In addition very long
averages need to be taken to smoothe out extremely large, erratic swings.
If this is done we see that the UK built up a modest overseas net asset
position during the years of large oil surplus, which was subsequently run
down, but is still on average slightly positive. The big change in the last
decade is in the US, which has apparently moved from positive net overseas
assets of nearly Dollars 400bn to a substantial negative asset position.
Many US business economists are highly suspicious of this supposed
deterioration because they believe that the estimates undervalue American
direct investment abroad.
The Bank of England Bulletin also shows how both the US balance of payments
deficit and Japanese surplus are offset for the time being by short-term
rather than long-term capital flows. But the writer goes out of his way to
stress this change does not necessarily make the imbalances 'any less
sustainable'.
The deeper truth is that entities such as countries do not have either
surpluses and deficits or positive or negative net assets. These belong to
individuals, corporations and other organisations including governments. The
international payments figures are only useful if this health warning is
always borne in mind.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need to assess risks of fuels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D A GIDLOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a pity Michael Pettman (Letters, October 29) has misunderstood
the main argument in the debate over fuel composition. It is true that the
level of benzene in petrol is controlled but this is irrelevant as other
aromatics in the fuel undergo change during combustion to form benzene. It
is therefore theoretically possible to have a fuel with no benzene but to
have significant quantities in the exhaust gases.
Many scientific publications have shown this clear relationship between
total aromatic content and benzene emissions. From the data, a recent study
has shown that premium unleaded will emit around 20 per cent more benzene
than leaded and super-unleaded will emit 30 per cent more benzene, if used
in cars not equipped with catalytic converters.
Both the select committee and the Royal Commission on Environmental
Protection were unanimous in their call for super-unleaded, with the highest
average aromatic content, to be banned. In view of the widespread concern
over benzene, it is surely time for the government to undertake a full risk
assessment of the various types of fuel and their appropriate uses.

<TEXT>
Sir, The insurance industry is rightly being pilloried for mis-selling
personal pensions. When is the government going to accept responsibility for
setting up the whole rickety framework? The concept of portable pensions was
laudable but the practical realisation has been badly flawed.
The Securities and Investments Board should prepare the public and life
insurance industry for the explosion of the next time bomb. This will be
when the time comes for employees of certain ages in non-pensionable
employment who contracted out of state earnings related pensions (Serps) to
contract back in. Independent financial advisers who sold them personal
pensions have no incentive to provide this advice.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Demand for capital behind rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY WHEELOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Since January, the US has put up interest rates five times. High yields
on fixed interest have become more attractive to institutions, putting
pressure on equities. That is why, by October 21, the FT-SE 100 had fallen
12.25 per cent.
These rises are America's pre-emptive strikes to prevent inflation. The
markets are still nervous about inflation and the implications of further
rises in interest rates.
Yet there is minimal sign of inflation anywhere in the world, apart from a
few commodity prices. So is this the real explanation of the markets'
current uncertainty? We are beginning to think not.
Five years ago, China began capitalist-type expansionist developments, but
had hardly drawn on the world's capital. Nor had Latin America, Hungary,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany. India is now open for business, as
well as all the Russian satellites. Given such an increased demand for the
world's capital, surely this is the main reason for the recent rises in
interest rates, not inflation.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Director's status crucial to LSO
position during inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE GILLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Fairman, in his review of the London Symphony Orchestra's Gala
concert ('Tireless Solti fires up LSO', October 27), raises the issue of the
LSO's role during the Hoffmann inquiry in 1993. There was one crucial issue
centrally affecting the public position the LSO took - that I am chairman of
the Association of British Orchestras (ABO), as well as being managing
director of the LSO.
After the Arts Council announced its funding decision for London orchestras
in July 1993 and set up the Hoffmann Committee, I offered my resignation as
chairman of the ABO if the board felt that my continuing as chairman would
create any conflict of interest. The ABO board unanimously asked me to
remain.
As the chairman of the ABO is always the manager of an orchestra, there can
be times when the chairman's orchestra will be centrally involved in an
issue the association has to deal with. It is the policy of the association
that, on these occasions, it should be represented solely by its director,
which was the case in 1993. Libby MacNamara, the director, ran all the
meetings on this subject and publicly represented the ABO position extremely
effectively.
Furthermore, during the Hoffmann inquiry, the Musicians' Union called a
meeting to consult players from the London orchestras about their views on
the very serious implications of the inquiry and to co-ordinate solidarity
between the orchestras. By far the greatest number of orchestral players
from any of the four London orchestras who attended that meeting were LSO
members; this does not indicate an orchestra which was not involved.
Fairman also raises a point about the LSO Millennium Fund. In the difficult
economic climate in which the LSO and all the UK orchestras are working, the
LSO players have taken no fee rises for the past three years in order to
fulfil the orchestra's commitment to the high artistic standards it has set
itself. The LSO Millennium Fund has been established to endeavour to try to
secure the orchestra's future and those very standards we have worked so
hard to achieve.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK is unaware that name of
competitive game has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R A BISCHOF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to Robert Barro's Personal View (November 1), as a
German businessman who has lived and worked in the UK for more than 25
years, I have to agree with shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown's view on
'endogenous growth', rather than chancellor Kenneth Clarke's.
The reasons are simple:
First, 'hands-on' government in industrial policy, export support, regional
aid, research and development projects, training and skill developments,
etc, is happening in all the countries Britain is competing against - at a
significant rate.
Second, the very nature of the Anglo-Saxon model, with its focus on
short-term profit maximisation, makes it harder for UK companies to compete
against their long-term, market share-oriented Asian and Continental
European competitors.
In other words, the UK is severely handicapped in two ways by hanging on to
the theory of pure non-interventionist capitalism - without having noticed
that half the world (the successful half) has changed the rules of the game.
Whether this is plain ignorance or an ideological trap is irrelevant. The
result has been a steady decline of UK manufacturing industries over 25
years - and there is no improvement in sight.

<TEXT>
The Truth About Top Executive Pay
By AP Williams Kogan Page, Pounds 25
'Executive remuneration is both a highly complex and a highly emotive
subject,' is Anthony Williams's conclusion to this guide to executive pay.
About that there is no argument, and a book that is able to establish both
the facts of the matter and a coherent approach deserves a wide circulation.
The studies quoted by the author demonstrate beyond doubt that something has
happened to top executive pay over the past 10 years or so that is not
accounted for by inflation. Nor can it be more than partly explained by the
catch-up needed after a decade in which executives' net pay fell in real
terms.
Large institutional investors such as PosTel are often accused - as Williams
does in this book - of being critical of executive remuneration. That is a
misrepresentation of our position, however. Apart from requesting that
reward is related to the success or otherwise of the company, as seen by
shareholders, we make no such sweeping statement.
Except in extreme cases, institutions cannot pontificate about the levels of
pay that a board votes for its executives. I have enough difficulty in
determining the correct pay levels for my own executives, let alone those in
industries of which I have only a sketchy knowledge.
Where the investor has a legitimate concern is in ensuring that the
interests of the executives and the shareholders are aligned in determining
the structures by which pay is determined and the various rewards available.
In the past, many senior executives had substantial shareholdings in the
company for which they worked. Shares were held by family members, not by
professional investing institutions.
It is the rise of the professional manager that has created the need for new
structures. The investing institutions demand a check on the otherwise
unfettered power of the executives, who might be tempted to live well at the
shareholders' expense.
A remuneration committee, made up of independent non-executive directors, is
a body that should give us that confidence. Unfortunately, it does not
always do so.
Too often these committees seem to be reactive rather than to think for
themselves. They interpret the mantra of remuneration policy - that a
package should be able to recruit, retain and motivate good management - as
an invitation to follow the consensus on what the marketplace demands.
This is where the consultants, among whom Williams is counted, must take
some of the blame. As he says: 'There is at least one well-known firm of
consultants which is believed to be used by certain companies . . . because
it recommends the high figures that their chief executives prefer.'
Almost every company falls into the trap of wanting to reward its executives
at top quartile levels (fund managers offer similar promises to potential
clients). Yet three-quarters of companies will not be in the top quartile:
it reminds me of the Labour cabinet minister of the 1970s who longed for
every worker to be paid more than the average wage.
Linking executive pay to average market levels is simply a game of leapfrog.
Each company and each job is different, and a different combination of
reward will be needed to recruit the right management.
On what the combination should be, Williams's view is broadly compatible
with PosTel's:
A reasonable base salary, out of which a senior executive can lead a
comfortable - but not excessive - existence.
A short-term bonus, of limited size, dependent on demanding short-term
targets on internal forecasts or budgets being met.
A long-term bonus, perhaps capped only at a high level, dependent on the
performance of the company, as perceived by the shareholder, over at least
three years.
The hurdle for the latter might be a measure of shareholders' total return,
against a suitable peer group. Boots, for example, uses a mixture of
retailers and drug companies for comparison.
There is no place here for conventional share options. They were a
reasonable device when marginal income tax rates were between 80 per cent
and 98 per cent, but have no clear role today.
Many companies now prefer to create trusts in restricted shares, to which
executives get access after a period of service. The scheme run by Reuters,
the news agency, for example, allocates shares after three years, but the
shares cannot be sold for another two years. This is a better way of
retaining the services of a successful executive than any contract.
Williams and I do not disagree much on the question of executives' contracts
either: the three-year rolling contract is almost impossible to justify. A
three-year fixed contract which is succeeded by a one-year 'roller' should
be enough to attract someone away from a secure job and offer protection
against a breakdown in relations at an early stage.
A good executive, asked to leave for reasons other than lack of competence,
will not find it difficult to be recruited elsewhere; the market knows the
truth. The way to ensure that executives take the risks necessary to build
businesses is to offer substantial rewards when their risk-taking has borne
fruit in the long-term performance of their company.
The 1994 Hay survey of executive contracts shows a fall in their average
term, with three-year contracts no longer in the majority for directors
other than chief executives. Perhaps that will convince the 37 per cent of
companies which are waiting to 'see what others will do, and will follow the
market norm' that their time has come to move.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: The Editing Process - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In The Editing Process, the new play by Meredith Oakes now staged by Stephen
Daldry at the Royal Court Theatre, the word 'editing' scarcely if ever
occurs. And the concrete practice of editing - of making a literary work
suitable for publication - also makes only fleeting appearances. No
accident, this. On one level, Oakes is showing us the terrible truth about
modern publishing: that all too little of it is actually concerned with the
central process of editing. On another level, however, as she shows us the
larger processes of a large publishing house, she lets us feel the larger
metaphorical sense of 'editing'. Editing, even on a tiny paragraph, has many
ingredients: improving, changing, adding, subtracting, deleting. I edit, he
edits, they have been edited.
The Editing Process is a satire - bitter and tender, very uneven and always
interesting - about aspects of modern life. At first it is mainly about the
dismaying way in which a serious specialist journalistic endeavour is
incorporated into a brash philistine publishing firm; and for any sensitive
person with some acquaintance with the ways of modern publishing this is a
highly affecting subject. Oakes's treatment, however, is tough and ironic.
The little old magazine, Footnotes in History (ho ho) - edited by William,
with the support of his long-term secretary, Peggy, who keeps on resigning
from her job - is in no way run well. William is lofty, pompous,
insensitive, in person and, one presumes, as an editor. But the crass modern
establishment in which Footnotes in History finds itself is just as absurd.
Its corridors bristle with careerism; and Ted, the assistant editor, proves
responsive to the new climate.
Later, however, the play's subject becomes redundancy. Peggy must be made
redundant; William lacks the guts to tell her. He not only drives her hard
towards resignation, he does nothing to woo her back this time when (near
the end of Act One) she does resign. In due course (during Act Two),
redundancy comes to William too. But whereas Peggy still believes in
Footnotes in History with a selfless love, William suddenly feels that his
whole career has been a fraud. And, anyway, they are both footnotes in
history now. 'Life does go on, doesn't it,' Peggy says; then (my favourite
line) 'As soon as one's back is turned, life goes on.'
It is by no means a completely realistic play. There are sudden soliloquies
amid ensemble scenes; and there are set speeches like arias, set dialogue
like duets or stichomythia. The characterisations are complex but not always
convincing. Still, its blend of realism, stylisation, and artifice is what
Daldry's production emphasises intensely. William, attacking his new boss
Lionel, says 'People like you swim in the polluted waters of this company
all oblivious, opening and shutting your mouths with the idiot complacency
of dying fish.' Et voila] The dominant metaphor of Daldry's, and his
designer's Ian McNeil's, staging. We see fish-tanks small and large around
the office of Footnotes in History; and we see, I think, that the office -
the firm - is itself a goldfish bowl, enveloped in a high curving perspex
wall.
A note of caution. Too many Daldry stagings seem to apply the same formula:
heavy scenic effects to stress a play's socialist intentions. Watching and
hearing, you may well feel that Daldry and Co. are pressing more omens,
metaphors, and melodrama from the play than it needs.
On the other hand, the play is strongly cast, and most of its pacing
excellent. Fascinating to watch Prunella Scales, whose method is to fix the
social character of a role with a satiric edge, as Peggy, alongside Alan
Howard, whose style is to stylise a role's pure thought, as William. There
are moments when they hardly seem to be on the same planet, but their
dissimilarity underlines the whole point of Oakes's writing. The Editing
Process - Daldry's first production of a new play  - is just the kind of
drama the Royal Court is all about.

If his previous work is an accurate guide, Steve Humphries' documentary
series Forbidden Britain will be well worth watching. It looks at 'Britain's
secret past from 1900 to 1960' starting with juvenile crime (9.45 BBC2).
Remember the famous Channel 4 'remit'? Something to do with being different
and catering for minorities, wasn't it? Today they begin a series called
Beat That Einstein in which people with little scientific knowledge are
required to complete a task with the help of only a few books and garden
shed tools (8.00). Reminds you of 'The Great Egg Race'? Me too. Drop The
Dead Donkey is not dramatically different from other comedies, but it is
welcome since it is often funny (10.00). The programme that best exemplifies
the Channel 4 idea is Pagliacci which is transmitted at 2.45 in the morning.
This is not the British 1936 coloured film with Richard Tauber, but an even
more obscure offering: a monochrome 1947 version starring Tito Gobbi and
featuring Gina Lollobrigida in her first movie. She mimes the role of Nedda
which is sung by Onelia Fineschi. Set the VCR.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: Angelin Preljocaj - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not the opportunity for rabid foxes to race into this country that
bothers me about the Channel Tunnel, but the increased threat from European
modern dance troupes.
So I thought during two-thirds of a Dance Umbrella evening on Tuesday at
Sadler's Wells. There on stage were the choreographies and dancers of
Angelin Preljocaj (Albanian-French and much admired on the European dance
circuit). I have reported on his work before, with some reluctance. As with
so much French modern dance, I find his creations intellectually costive,
top-heavy with meaning and woefully thin in movement.
Preljocaj's programme had the unmitigated gall to call itself a Homage to
the Ballets Russes. The first piece - Un trait d'union - was wholly
unconnected with Diaghilev's enterprise. It showed two chaps trying to pick
each other up, physically as well as sexually, while having hell with a
squat chair. It claimed to be about the quest for what is known today as 'a
relationship'. Like so much of this kind of modern dance, it was about bad
manners - social, sexual, emotional - which are as boring on stage as they
are in life. The men climb over each other, and show remarkable muscular
sympathy, while Bach and electronic clatter ring out. And, of course, they
end up as they began - alone. Someone imported a baby into the stalls on
Tuesday night: its cries of distress indicated that a critical faculty can
be encouraged at the earliest age.
There followed a shameful assault on Le spectre de la rose. The stage
laterally divided. Two girls, two matadors and two chairs on one side. On
the other, a crop-headed maiden and a man in a rose-petalled outfit trying
to toss her like a caber. The Karajan recording of Weber's waltz  - broken
into by sounds of a dripping tap and faint burblings, of course. Further
comment would be an act of supererogation.
All this was Eurotrash of the most debilitating kind. With his version of
Les Noces, Preljocaj succeeded in a reappraisal of the Stravinsky score. His
theme is still marriage, here seen as an event in which stereotypical male
attitudes remain potent. Five couples. Five benches. Five large dummies
dressed as brides. Much throwing of bodies, and of the dummies which serve
as ideals and role-models for the women. The choreography touches the score
hardly at all - hearing all those rhythms going to waste was rather like
watching fivers thrown in a dustbin. What Preljocaj does identify is the
persistence of social roles - and his piece has value because he uses
movement to convey this. The language is not very enterprising - his is a
catch-as-catch-can style - but the dance has theatrical shape, and comments
aptly on a Ballets Russes original. It was done with brilliant timing and
energy by its cast.
The end of this week will brings a Wells visit by Siobhan Davies' company in
two works - Wanting to tell stories and The Glass blew in (with a fine Gavin
Bryars score) - on which I reported admiringly earlier this year.

MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN (15) Kenneth Branagh
DARK SUMMER (12) Charles Teton
LOVE IN THE STRANGEST WAY (15)Christopher Frank
Almost every time a famous literary classic is re-filmed, the director makes
a production number out of claiming that he has 'gone back to the original.'
This prompts several questions in the sceptical mind. How many originals are
there to keep going back to? Do we want a film to go back to its original?
And how many people, as well as myself, look forward to the day when a
director has the nerve and freshness to say, 'We didn't give a monkey's
about the original. We threw the book away unread. We did our own thing.'
Kenneth Branagh, the star and director of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,
claims that he has gone back to the book. But almost everything good about
this film lies in its abjuration of the literary; almost everything bad in
its cumbrous invocation of it.
Mary Shelley created a great central idea and a two great central figures:
Victor Frankenstein the crazed New Age scientist, and the creature he
cobbles together from other people's spare parts. But the story that the
novel sets spinning around this Promethean sun is weak and diffuse. Too many
satellite characters are brought in merely to be burned up. And the
geography tacks recklessly, pointlessly across terrestrial space from Geneva
to the Orkneys to the Arctic.
The film's second half mimics these miscreant components. Branagh's
Frankenstein, if he lived today, would qualify for frequent flyer points.
Now he is in cholera-ridden Germany. Now he is hunting murdered relatives in
Switzerland. Now, at a come-and-get-me cue from Robert De Niro's creature,
he is hacking his way around the North Pole.
To compensate for topographical jump-cuts, the screenwriters Steph Lady and
Frank Darabont anchor the drama at other points with leaden,
spell-it-for-morons dialogue. Hero's mother (Cherie Lunghi): 'You know,
Victor, life shouldn't be all study.' Hero's girlfriend (Helena
Bonham-Carter): 'Victor, you're completely obsessed.' Victor: 'There's
something at work in my soul which I do not understand.'
We know that, Victor. We have intuited it. We do not need it written up on
the blackboard.
Then suddenly Branagh will throw away the book, and the script, and the
ghosts of the Lake Geneva gang of four whose story-writing symposium
produced this fable, and run amok with the camera. The laboratory scenes are
magnificent. We bob, weave and soar through airspace - courtesy of director
and cinematographer (Roger Pratt) - while Branagh's bare-torso'd
super-boffin charges around the Heath Robinson bric-a-brac. Steam swirls.
Pipes hiss. And the overhead trolley-rail, carrying the huge copper
immersion tank containing the first man-made man, clatters like a
rollercoaster.
Out of this tank emerges Robert De Niro, scarred and naked and tumbling onto
the wet floor for a funny-horrific eel dance between Frankenstein and his
grisly, slithery catch. This scene, as semi-nude creator struggles to set
wholly-nude creature on his feet, has the tone the whole film might
profitably have had. A horror-comedy version of Genesis: where God is played
by man, temptation by a monstrous man-fish, and the Garden of Eden by an
overgrown attic with its metallic jungle of gewgaws.
But as soon as the creature escapes, so does the film's compacted passion.
There is no terror in De Niro's lumbering scarface in a greatcoat: just a
husky-familiar De Niro slur delivered with that cocked-head abstractedness
we know from a dozen De Niro roles.
Watching the film is an exercise in frustration. There are flashes of
brilliance as bright as lightning bolts: like the two horrific long-roped
hanging scenes, in which Branagh has dreamt up a bungee style of execution
for early 19th century Europe; or like the camera's queasy glidings over the
Frankensteins' giant staircase (imported from Kane's Xanadu?) as people
stumble up or down it carrying fresh disasters.
As an actor's director Branagh may be the best in the business. He wrings
the last drop of idiomatic life from players like Ian Holm, as father
Frankenstein, and John Cleese, improbably but effectively cast as a grim
sawbones. And Branagh's own performance is pure, barnstorming splendour.
But there is a point in this story when panache no longer has a premium. We
want alarm, foreboding, cold panic, timor mortis. The movie's poster carries
a warning: 'Certain scenes may prove disturbing for some viewers.' What
scenes? Did I miss them? Were they taken out? If so: back to the laboratory,
please, for the 'Director's Version.'
For most of its span Charles Teton's Dark Summer seems so inert that we keep
poking it with our perceptions, as if it were a hedgehog at the side of the
road. Is it dead or just playing dead? A gently chugging reggae score
accompanies images of a picturesquely distressed Liverpool  - soot-black
sunsets, grey rivers, drydocked ships - while two scarce-constructed
characters meet, love and drift apart.
He is Abe (Steve Ako), a coffee-coloured mechanic and would-be boxer. She is
Jes (Joeline Garner Joel), a white girl temping at her father's scrapmetal
yard. They meet and link destinies. Then they go through pregnancy,
miscarriage and break-up.
It is hard to convey the extent to which nothing happens. For 84 out of 85,
the filmgoer fidgets while first-time director Teton sets up his Merseyside
tableaux vivants, like a neighbour readying hapless friends for his holiday
slides.
Only in one magically pained scene does the film gel. The two lovers are in
bed, she turned away from him. He braves a single, cramped, anxiously
reaching word, 'Jes'; she does not answer. The camera, on his face, watches
that moment of numbed, irradiated awareness when an entire relationship
crumbles. A film whose 'economy' elsewhere seems that of artistic poverty
stumbles, for a small second, on the true economy of tragedy.
France's Love In The Strangest Way tells of a married man (Thierry
Lhermitte) who falls for a bit on the side (Nadia Fares). The bit in
question, a mystery redhead met at a cafe, is soon harrying him and his wife
(Maruschka Detmers) right up to the murderous climax. She has clearly seen,
as has writer-director Christopher Frank, Fatal Attraction.
Early scenes involving marital paranoia and an accident-prone rocking horse
are promising. But then the plot becomes progressively Hollywoodised.
Sinister phone calls; a death-dealing shovel; a 'body' behind a wall; and a
twist ending that succeeds only in knotting beyond repair our already
tangled braincells.
But the French film beats the two short German 'comedies' opening together
this week. Did the UK distributors win these in a raffle? In Making Up two
love-seeking women friends have fun and heartache dating two tiresome men.
And in The Most Beautiful Breasts In The World a pneumatic girl surreally
swaps mammaries with a man after bumping into him in a lift. Laugh? At the
press show you could hear a handout drop.
In the same programme there is a ghastly New Zealand short about a girl
dating an extraterrestrial. What did we do to deserve this triple bill? Did
we all say 'trick' instead of 'treat' last Monday? Never mind. There is
always the London Film Festival. Worth sampling during the coming week: one
each from Taiwan, Cambodia and India (Eat Drink Man Woman, Rice People,
Bandit Queen) and a clutch of celebrity interviews including Hal Hartley,
Christopher Lee and those nice Creature Comforts folk from Aardman
Animation.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Arts: Entertaining Mr Sloane/Loot - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is only 26 years since Joe Orton's death. Had he lived, he would today be
only 61 years old. Almost nothing in his black comedies has dated. The
connections between greed, lust, and criminality remain heartstoppingly
funny; and some of his jokes about the Kafkaesque British police in Loot are
astonishingly 'now'.
So it is upsetting to discover how seldom his plays are revived in
appropriate style. Orton's supreme joke is in his ironic - Wildean - mastery
of language. Characters frequently speak with precise formality about
matters carnal and/or criminal. Fay to Mr McLeavy (in Loot): 'You've been a
widower for three days. Have you considered a second marriage yet?' The
lines need maximum clarity and minimum interpretation. The more suave their
delivery, the more delicious their irony.
Or so it seems to some of us out there in the dark. In recent years,
however, each Orton revival I have seen has been less stylish than the last.
The Birmingham Rep is now presenting an Orton double bill - directed by
Gwenda Hughes, designed by Kate Owen, with four actors performing in both
plays - in which Loot is creakily entertaining and Entertaining Mr Sloane
staggeringly short of innuendo.
It does not help Orton's comedy if the hostess Kath, telling her new lodger
Sloane that she has nothing on under her dress, reveals a firm petticoat; or
if, where Orton specifies a 'transparent negligee', she wears a fluff-lined
dressing-gown. Apart from these mere external factors, Stephanie Fayerman's
interpretation - pigeon-toed, half-gauche and half-dainty, hysterical - is
woefully over-emphatic, making a heavy meal out of the character's non-U
nursery talk and utterly missing the classic English joke of her romantic
social pretensions ('You have the air of lost wealth . . . Did Dr Barnardo
give you a bad time?').
Michael Cashman does better as her brother Ed, but he usually stresses the
creepy side of Ed's homoerotic desires while not knowing how to make them
disarmingly funny too. As Mr Sloane, who seduces them both, young Ian
Pepperell (though physically too slight) has the right inscrutability, but
not nearly enough skill in nuance. Sloane is a heartless thug who fools
people he is an innocent - an innocent in need of firm . . . guidance; and
his deadpan account of his sporting . . . activities should be irresistible.
When Orton is not well enough acted, his originality dissolves. Watching the
Birmingham Loot, however, you are aware of little but Orton's subversive
novelty. Each character is consistent, but there is just enough absurdity in
the air for us to be undermined by hilarity.
Too much absurdity, actually. Most of the cast - especially Cashman as
Inspector Truscott - have such fun with Irish or Scouse accents that they
stress some words more for sound effect than for sense. Still, Cashman
plainly relishes his role; as does John Rogan as the bewildered widower Mr
McLeavy. Pepperell's Hal and Ian Targett's energetic, nervous Dennis give
fluent accounts of the two unscrupulous young coffin-despoiling
bank-robbers. Fayerman, as the much-married killer nurse Fay McMahon, still
overdoes the busy gestures and oeillades, but here she adopts the right
basic suavity. (Good Orton must hover persistently on the brink of camp.)
Wittily, Kate Owen has located the two plays next door to each other, in two
halves of one semi-detached house on the same revolving stage. Two of the
problems in Sloane are that she obliges us to see action (in the kitchen, or
upstairs) that Orton meant to occur offstage, and that she shows us the
flock of cuddly-toys that Kath keeps in her bedroom. (Doesn't much of
Orton's essence always lie in what he does not show us?) In Loot, however,
we see little save what Orton meant us to see, and the comedy of what is
seen and unseen flourishes.
At the Birmingham Rep.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Bang up to date - Bernard Gray reviews two books
which show that the story of how the Bomb was born has lessons for today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreement that North Korea is currently preparing to sign with the US to
limit its nuclear programme may avert a potentially dangerous proliferation
of atomic weapons material in Asia. It also has ramifications for the
handling of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, due to be renewed next
year. How the west handles its own nuclear disarmament, and how it deals
with developing countries' nuclear ambitions are central in the debate about
nuclear proliferation.
But the story of the North Korean nuclear programme has a more disturbing
resonance from the west's recent past. Two books published recently about
the British and Soviet atomic bombs show just how closely the Koreans were
following the path which the second world war allies trod 50 years ago.
The kind of nuclear reactors Korea built recently, and the purpose for which
they were intended, are almost identical to those constructed by the US, the
UK and the Soviet Union during the 1940s.
Those interested in the science and engineering of how an aspiring weapons
state might go about building a nuclear bomb can learn much from either of
these books. David Holloway's* is the more serious, and is an important
addition to the history of the Bomb. Brian Cathcart's account** is lighter,
and sadly misses out much of the detail that gives Holloway his authority.
Yet the scientific detective story, the romance, and ultimately the horror
of the original development and use of the atomic bomb is still best set out
in Richard Rhodes's award-winning and definitive story first published in
1986***. As well as technical detail, Rhodes picks out the human side of the
story: the struggles of physicists, many Jewish fugitives, against technical
challenges and political obstacles makes compelling reading. His account of
Hiroshima is harrowing.
The two more recent books lack the thrill of the initial chase and its
sickening conclusion, but they throw fascinating light on the similarities
and differences between the US, Britain and the Soviet Union. Cathcart's
book is written in a less academic style, but both books tell parallel
stories about the same period and inevitably view the same incidents through
different lenses.
In all three countries bureaucratic bungling held back development. It was
more than two years after Einstein wrote to Roosevelt, warning the president
of the possibility of the Bomb, that there was a significant US effort to
produce atomic weapons.
In the Soviet Union Stalin had received excellent intelligence from Britain
and the US on the critical issues in bomb development, but Russia in the
early part of the war was thinking of survival in terms of weeks, rather
than the years that the new superbomb would take.
Even when the USSR regained the initiative, Molotov, the foreign secretary,
did not trust his own scientists and believed the reports could be a plot by
the west to make Russia waste resources on a pointless scheme. Only
Hiroshima finally shifted official Russian attitudes.
Britain had more mundane concerns. Having been ahead in 1940, thanks largely
to a brilliant analysis of the main problems by Frisch and Peierls at
Birmingham University - leaked wholesale to the Russians - Britain refused
to share its work equally with the US. The Americans soon pulled ahead and
it was not until 1943 that the US readmitted the UK to the project.
Despite the UK effort to help develop the Bomb, the US cut Britain off from
atomic research after the war. Attlee then determined that Britain must have
at least the capacity to build nuclear weapons. William Penney was
encouraged to head the project but he ran headlong into Whitehall. Other
departments were so jealous of resources that they refused to supply half a
dozen draughtsmen for a project the prime minister had given the highest
priority.
There are many such vignettes in both books. Beria, the secret police chief
in charge of the Russian Bomb, made a list of those to be shot or deported
to Siberia if the project failed. When it worked, he used the same list:
those who would have been shot were made Heroes of Soviet Labour; those to
have been deported received lesser honours; those who would merely have been
sacked got commendations. In the UK, Penney got a knighthood.
The Americans, once persuaded of the viability of the Bomb, were typically
thorough and threw enormous effort and scientific skill at it. By 1945 the
project had cost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The British were typically
proud of the fact that they built their Bomb on a shoestring. The Russians
poured in the full resources of the command economy and had no idea how much
they spent. 'Give them what they want,' Stalin told Beria, 'we can always
shoot them later.'
Neither the British nor the Russians made much of the fact that their first
atomic bombs were direct copies of the original US design.
Chillingly, given how much technology has progressed since, that design is
nearly the one that would be used by a nascent weapons state today. Those
trying to learn the lessons of 50 years ago can see clearly that once the
physics had been established, getting plutonium or enriched uranium was the
hardest problem. Producing it requires enormous, expensive sites, which are
relatively easy to spot, as in Korea.
Controlling the production and flow of plutonium is the only way to keep the
nuclear genie even half way in the bottle. The destructive power of the
Bomb, vividly described in these books, makes that an urgent task for the
negotiators to take on.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Military eyes in the sky - A look at a French
project to make Europe's spy satellites less US-dependent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In one respect, president Saddam Hussein's imitation of the grand old Duke
of York in marching his men to the Kuwaiti border and then marching them
back again came at just the right time for the French government.
It helped remind France's politicians, taxpayers and European partners how
essential satellite intelligence was to tracking the vagaries of Iraqi troop
movements this time, just as it was during the Gulf war of 1991; it reminded
everyone of why Paris plans to raise spending on military space activities,
mostly spy satellites, by 24 per cent to FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) in 1995 alone.
France's overall political aim is to make itself in particular, and Europe
in general, less dependent on the US for military satellite information. In
the 1991 war France's Spot civil satellite produced a useful complement to
the Pentagon's KH (Key Hole) military satellites, because Spot produces
stereoscopic photos, providing a three-dimensional image. But Spot lacks the
pinpoint detection of America's 'Big Birds', as it is unable to detect
anything less than 10m wide.
France has been spending heavily on military satellites since 1986 when it
started the Helios I programme with Italy and Spain which are funding,
respectively, 14 and 7 per cent of the programme.
Early next year Ariane is due to put into orbit the first Helios 1
satellite, whose images will be processed at Torrejon in Spain. This ex-US
Air Force base near Madrid has been converted into a satellite picture
processing unit run by the Western European Union, the defence wing of the
European Union, which has so far only been fed by images from Spot.
The French are well aware, however, that Helios I is far from completely
answering Europe's needs. It may cost more than FFr11bn, but it is simply an
optic system and can take photographs only during the day and in good
weather. Enough, perhaps, to cope with the interests that Helios I's three
partners have in the Mediterranean, but not much good for covering the
often-cloudy regions of northern and eastern Europe. Nor will the planned
successor programme, Helios II, be much better in this regard; its infra-red
imaging will penetrate night, but not heavy cloud. Spain also said this
summer that it would drop out of the FFr7bn Helios II programme because it
could no longer afford its 7 per cent share.
But hopes are rising in Paris that Germany may at last join in - not
necessarily in Helios, but possibly in France's Osiris project for a radar
satellite, or in a much more ambitious Europe-wide project being discussed
in the WEU. The German government and industry are much more interested in
spy satellite detection by radar that pierces clouds and can even reveal
subterranean objects, such as bunkers, lying in several metres of loose
soil, such as sand.
A feasibility study conducted for WEU defence ministers by some 30 companies
under the leadership of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and a subsidiary, Dornier,
which makes medium-range turboprop aircraft, puts the cost of a complete
system at up to Ecu14bn (Pounds 11bn) over a life of roughly 1997 to 2022.
This seems expensive, but perhaps less so given that WEU's 10 member
countries could split the cost over a quarter century and given that the
system would include a mix of manoeuvrable radar and optic/infra-red
satellites with space-based relay stations. The optic/infra-red satellites
would have a resolution down to 50cm-100cm, while that of the radar
satellites would be 3m.
Different platforms are needed because radar imaging is carried out at an
oblique angle and therefore on a satellite on a different orbit to optic or
infra-red photography which is conducted vertically above the target. As for
relaying images to the processing centre, the only alternative to
space-based relay stations would be to have ground stations around the
globe.
Not surprisingly, the WEU project is hanging fire. Cost is the overwhelming
drawback for all WEU members. But there is perhaps another element in the
opposition of the two most reluctant countries - Britain and the
Netherlands. While both are attached to Nato, the UK is the only Nato ally
to which the US gives raw images from its satellites, rather than the
processed data Washington gives to the rest of the alliance.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Power cable conduct
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first prototype superconductor power cable is to be made by a
consortium of companies and laboratories with backing from the US Department
of Energy.
American Superconductor, a leader in the development of superconducting
wires, Pirelli Cable, a division of the Pirelli group, and the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI), which is funded by US electrical utility
companies, will undertake the project with researchers at three of the US
National Laboratories.
The goal is to make a 30m superconductor underground power transmission
cable, to be tested under real operating conditions by EPRI. The Dollars
5.8m (Pounds 3.7m) project will be funded jointly by the Department of
Energy and the companies.
Superconductor materials lose resistance to the flow of electric current at
low temperatures. The first metal superconductors, discovered early this
century, had to be cooled to nearly 4` Kelvin, or or -454`F.
In 1986, however, 'high temperature superconductor' (HTS) ceramics were
discovered. These materials exhibit superconductivity at temperatures up to
130`K or -225`F, substantially reducing the costs of cooling.
The cable will be made by stranding HTS wires round a hollow core. The
superconducting material is cooled by running liquid nitrogen through the
cable. 'We are truly approaching the commercialisation of HTS power
transmission cables,' says Giuseppe Morchio, general manager of Pirelli's
cable operations. 'The cables demonstrated under this programme will show
the improved performance and reliability that HTS technology can provide.'
The prototype cable will be able to carry more than twice the power of
conventional copper cables of similar size. Ultimately, superconducting
cables are expected to be able to carry many times the power of copper
cables with lower energy losses.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Polls apart - German
agencies underestimated the differences between east and west in recent
elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Make it simple. Make it direct. And tap into issues with which people can
identify. This was the message Dominique Kahane, a director of the Trialon
advertising agency, used for a highly successful federal election campaign
in eastern Germany.
Staff at Trialon, which represented the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
successor to east Germany's former communist party, believed they had a
considerable advantage over its competitors from among Germany's other
established political parties.
'We are all easterners,' says Kahane. 'Our office is in east Berlin. Some of
us grew up with the candidates. We knew the day-to-day problems the
easterners have been having since unification.'
Instead of focusing on general issues, Trialon homed in on unemployment and
housing issues which preoccupy most east Germans. 'The success of our
campaign is in the result,' says Kahane. The PDS polled more than 22 per
cent of the vote throughout eastern Germany. 'If anyone wants to come to
eastern Germany and try to market a product or a party, you have to do your
homework,' Kahane adds.
Germany's Free Democrats and Bundnis 90/Greens may be regretting that they
did not take to the streets. Indeed, both parties are slowly coming to terms
with the disastrous results inflicted on them in eastern Germany.
The FDP failed in eastern Germany to gain 5 per cent of the vote in the last
federal elections. And along with the Greens, it failed to get represented
in the eastern state parliaments of Thuringia and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern -
neither could muster enough support to win 5 per cent of the vote, the
minimum to enter these parliaments.
'If we want to do better in future, we will have to adopt a completely new
strategy,' says Wulf Oehme, the FDP's party manager in Berlin.
The lesson drawn by the FDP and other political parties during the federal
election campaign is that east Germany is different - the results confirm
this. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's victorious Christian Democrats (along with
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union) gained 38.5 per cent
of the vote in the east compared with 42.2 per cent in the west; the
opposition Social Democrats 31.9 per cent and 37.6 per cent respectively;
the FDP 4 per cent and 7.7 per cent; and the Greens 5.7 per cent in the east
and 7.8 per cent in the west.
But the question is what kind of lessons the FDP and other parties have
actually learned from the voting trends among east Germans.
'During the campaign, we had made no distinctions between east and west,'
says Oehme. 'But we soon found out that several of the party organisations
in the east say they would not even put up the same posters, even if they
included Klaus Kinkel (leader of the FDP).'
The FDP (which used Ogilvy &amp; Mather) also soon learned that its slogans and
posters which tended to concentrate on Leistungsfahigkeit, or efficiency,
meant nothing to the easterners. 'There is, as yet, no strong
entrepreneurial middle-class elite in eastern Germany. Also, if we used
slogans extolling libertarian values, which is also the basis of our support
in the west, we found out that these values had little relevance for the
easterners,' says Oehme.
The SPD also tried not to make any distinction in its election campaign
between east and west Germany. But Frank Stauss from Butter, the SPD's
advertising agency, says the party sometimes did focus on specific east
German themes. One of these included property, a controversial issue in the
east because former owners have been allowed to return and reclaim land
which had either been confiscated by the Nazis or expropriated by the
communists.
'We found an east German family and used them in our posters in the east.
The slogan we used was 'What is ours, remains ours',' explains Stauss. 'The
easterners could identify with that.'
Throughout the campaign, the SPD discovered other differences between the
two Germanys. 'In west Germany those who come to the market place to hear a
politician come because they support that party. In east Germany we found
out that the same people came to the CDU and SPD rallies to find out more.
You just cannot assume you have your supporters at each rally.' Also in the
east the SPD could take out a page of advertising spelling out policies in
detail. 'The easterners read more and want to know more than in the west,'
says Stauss. 'Anyone coming into east Germany should know that there is
still an insatiable appetite for information.'
Kohl's CDU, however, refused to make any differences between east and west.
'Our strategy had two main aims,' explains Elke Tonscheidt, a CDU official
involved in the campaign. 'The first strategy was to regard Germany as one
country. So we kept the same slogans throughout. The second strategy was the
Chancellor himself. It was his personality we were selling both in east and
west Germany. We never deviated from that.'
All parties concede that personalities mattered during the campaign, but
they also agree that knowledge about local or regional conditions proved
crucial. 'Despite five years of German unification, no marketing agency
should take anything for granted in the east. The differences are narrowing.
But there's a long way to go yet before both Germanys are really united,'
says Kahane.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Credit cards go
awooing - A look at an increasingly cut-throat UK market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Must have a good credit rating, yet be sufficiently relaxed to spend
regularly without wanting to pay off the bill each month.
It may sound like a mercenary 'lonely hearts' advertisement, but the line
neatly sums up the qualities that all credit card issuers are looking for
these days. Despite the Pounds 10-Pounds 12 annual fee most of their profit
comes from the annual percentage rate charged on outstanding bills.
Their common aim notwithstanding, players in this increasingly cut-throat
business have adopted a diverse range of marketing strategies over the last
year.
An important catalyst was the launch of the GM card from Vauxhall last
October, followed by the entry of other surprising issuers, such as
newspapers. No one expects the contest for customers to do anything but
intensify.
GM stepped up the competition for credit card customers - who splashed out
almost Pounds 26bn in the first nine months of this year - by offering an
annualised percentage rate (APR) of interest below that charged by the
largest issuers, no annual fee, and points towards a discount on buying a
Vauxhall car. One year later, there are about 450,000 GM cards in
circulation.
Save &amp; Prosper, the investment house, has found that a combination of
advertising and close targeting pays off. The card is available only to UK
home owners, and its main selling point is an APR among the lowest on offer.
Mark Christopher, S&amp;P marketing manager, admits the strategy cuts across
conventional wisdom, but says press advertising gives a better cost per
inquiry than direct mailing - or did when the latter was last tried in 1990.
Advertising's effectiveness may lie in the fact that S&amp;P is content to have
built up gradually to its current 200,000 or so cards issued jointly with
Robert Fleming.
A further factor is that it is aiming to attract a relatively narrow group
of people who know they intend to borrow and so are 'rate sensitive': for
others the existence of an annual fee is more of a deterrent, since they pay
off the bill in time to avoid interest charges.
The marketing campaign for the GM card, by contrast, has been intended to
win market share more quickly and more broadly for a brand previously
unfamiliar to the UK market.
Emma Serednyj, marketing manager for the GM card, says the campaign has been
based on an integrated approach, involving television and press advertising,
posters and direct mail shots with the aim of ensuring that someone who
receives a letter would already be aware of the card and have some idea of
what it offered.
For cards issued by the main clearing banks and some building societies the
marketing challenges are different.
The aim may be simply to reach the customer with whom the organisation
already has another - probably more important - relationship.
At Halifax Building Society, for example, credit cards are outside the core
business of savings and mortgages, but part of offering a full range of
financial services.
John Walsh, assistant general manager of banking at Halifax, says there is
therefore little point in television or press advertising, and much more to
be gained from targeting the society's 12m customers.
Although Halifax is one of only two issuers to offer interest on credit
balances, Walsh sees such peripheral benefits as little used and admits it
can be difficult to differentiate credit cards. 'There is a great deal of
inertia (among customers in personal financial services), and so we want to
be first to offer the service,' he says.
For Barclaycard, which with 8.8m cards has the largest share of the 27m card
UK credit card market, the issue has been different again. While it is part
of the Barclays group, as a credit card operation it wants to emphasise its
availability to customers of other banks as well.
Its most striking marketing strategy this year, however, has been its offer
of rebates of up to Pounds 150 to credit card holders transferring
outstanding debts from other cards.
This tactic - typically used by small issuers trying to break into the
market - is a further sign of the increasing competition.
Shaun Powell, Barclaycard's commercial director, believes that this will see
the market split into two types of card: the 'vanilla' product with no
annual fee and a low APR but no extra benefits; and cards that have higher
costs but are marketed on the basis of 'added value' - including insurance,
a range of discounts, and the opportunity to benefit good causes and even
political parties.
However desperately card issuers seek the ideal customer, it seems the need
to develop and market a card offering everything for nothing indefinitely is
still a long way away.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): WPP's training mix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Sorrell, chief executive of marketing services group WPP, hopes to
capture the interest of up to five 'ambidextrous brains' at Cambridge
University today. WPP is offering a three-year graduate trainee programme
spanning the advertising, public relations, design and research interests of
the group. The trainee places - rather grandly dubbed 'marketing
fellowships' - are among the first of their kind in the sector.
Sorrell's presentation to final-year students will outline the demands of
the constituent business as including 'flair and slog; intuition and logic;
left brain and right brain'.
The programme, which is likely to extend to recruitment from other UK
universities next year, and the US and East Asis in subsequent years, is
part of WPP's efforts to strengthen cross-disciplinary understanding.
Clients are looking, says Sorrell, for solutions that may not be primarily
based in media advertising.
Recruits will move around WPP sponsoring companies - including J. Walter
Thompson, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Hill and Knowlton, Millward Brown, Sampson
Tyrrell, and the Henley Centre - before taking up a permanent post.
WPP's move coincides with another to develop practitioners capable of
implementing the much vaunted 'integrated marketing' approach.
The Integrated Marketing Communications Initiative, launched last week,
embraces such bodies as the Public Relations Consultants Association, the
Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, the Direct Marketing Association
and the Sales Promotion Consultants Association.
Members of the trade bodies are being asked to sign up to a charter,
pledging support for cross-disciplinary training and work placements. An
advertising agency, for example, might offer a work placement to someone
from a PR company, and vice versa.

Hammerson's drive into continental Europe has taken a step forward with the
appointment of Oliver Ash as managing director of the group's European
operations. Ash, 36, is a committed Europhile, having lived in France,
Germany and Italy for the past 11 years.
Between 1987 and 1992 he worked for property developer Shaftesbury, building
office blocks and retail centres across the continent. When the development
markets froze with the onset of recession, Ash set up his own Paris-based
consultancy and was happily running his own business when Hammerson
approached him earlier this year. He will continue to live in Paris in his
new role.
Since one of Hammerson's declared aims is to expand its property portfolio
in continental Europe, Ash should have sufficient funds at his disposal. The
Pounds 250m proceeds from the disposal of the group's Australian interests
are widely expected to be reinvested before long, with French shopping
centres tipped as the most likely first move.
While Hammerson is looking to buy investment properties rather than
developments, Ash's experience in development will give the group more
options. 'I have no doubt that my developer's keen eye will come in useful,'
he says.

Sir Clive Whitmore, 59, the former permanent under-sec-retary at the Home
Office who took early retirement, is joining the board of merchant bankers
NM Rothschild &amp; Sons.
He has already joined the boards of Boots and Morgan Crucible and joins
Rothschild as a non-executive director on December 1. Although he will be
one of more than 20 non-execs at Rothschild, the merchant bank has taken the
slightly unusual step of announcing that 'his principal task will be in the
field of human resources'. Sir Clive has much experience in human resource
work, not least in senior appointments and selection procedures.
Rothschild has long had close ties to the Conservative government and Sir
Clive is the latest in a growing list of ex-civil servants who have ended up
in Rothschild's boardroom. These include Sir Frank Cooper, a former
permanent under-secretary at the Ministry of Defence, Lord Armstrong, a
former Cabinet Secretary, and Sir Derek Thomas, a former Foreign office
official and ex-Ambassador to Italy.
Sir Clive was principal private secretary to Margaret Thatcher for the first
three years of her government and subsequently permanent secretary at the
MoD and the Home Office. When he resigned from his last job there was
speculation that his early departure may have been linked to policy
differences with Michael Howard, the Home Secretary.

FT  03 NOV 94 / People: More feet under Stylo's table
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stylo, the Bradford-based footwear retailer and manufacturer, yesterday
promoted Michael Frankel, 50, and Stephen Lewis, 42, to the main board,
restoring the complement to 10 following the departure of Mike Smith and the
retirement of Patrick Hammond-Turner in the summer.
Smith, who was finance director, went to Athena, the Pentos subsidiary, as
md. This consolidated the position of Stylo's group md Michael Ziff, 41, who
was redesignated as chief executive in yesterday's changes.
'The change of title is to help people outside avoid confusion with our
divisional managing directors,' Ziff said, when asked about the adjustment
in nomenclature. Frankel will continue in one such divisional role, as md of
Stylo Barrett shoes. Lewis, a scientist with a PhD, will have overall
responsibility for information technology and distribution.
Stylo is hardly a household name for a company owning 500 retail outlets,
but Barratts, the name over most of their front windows, is. It was this
universal high street presence that led to Conrad Ritblat's British Land
trying to lever its way into the company during the 1980s property boom.
The concerted efforts of employee and Ziff family shareholders beat off the
challenge, led by the redoubtable Arnold Ziff, now 67, the chairman  - and
Michael's father. Ziff the elder also chairs the Leeds-based Town Centre
Securities and is one of Yorkshire's business establishment.
Will he now be taking a back seat? 'He is very much involved and, as usual,
telephoned me from London at 8 am this morning for Tuesday's sales figures,'
Michael Ziff said yesterday. Thanks to the computer technology new director
Lewis is in charge of, they were immediately available.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's self-regulatory body controlling advertising standards - the
Advertising Standards Authority - has appointed a new chairman to replace
Sir Timothy Raison when he retires at the end of his four years on January 1
1995.
The new chairman is to be Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank, former member of
parliament for Stockton-on-Tees, later Stockton North, between 1962-83. He
held a variety of cabinet posts in Labour governments. More widely known as
Bill Rodgers, he was a long-standing member of the Labour party until in
1981 he defected to be a founder member of the Social Democratic Party along
with Shirley Williams, David Owen and Roy Jenkins.
In 1987 he gave up being the SDP's vice-president to take a Pounds 65,000 a
year job as director general of the Royal Institute of British Architects, a
post he held until February this year.
Rodgers, 66, is now a Liberal Democrat and was created a life peer in 1992.
During the SDP's party conference in 1987 he was reported as saying that
'politics is a painful, damaging and often cruel business'. With such a
background, monitoring legality, truthfulness and decency in the world of
advertising should be a piece of cake.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Accountancy: Ringing the changes for the millennium -
Resource-based accrual accounting in all government departments is Clarke's
aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants are rarely afforded the opportunity to make history. The
chancellor of the exchequer held out such a possibility earlier this year.
'People will find other ways of celebrating the millennium,' said Kenneth
Clarke: 'But few will be more important. This is one of those highly
significant events.'
Mr Clarke was referring to the government's determination, repeated by the
paymaster general last week, to introduce resource-based accrual accounting
in all its departments by 1998. If these reforms are fully implemented, with
the attendant reform of the management culture, the results will most
certainly be revolutionary.
The annual public expenditure survey, which sets government spending
targets, will be carried out on the new basis from 2000 onwards. The process
of change will undoubtedly generate business for accountants. The large
accountancy firms are watching developments - and the likely consultancy
needs which may arise - with keen interest. The cost of transition alone has
been estimated at Pounds 3m per government department.
At the moment the government's green paper: Better Accounting for the
Taxpayers Money: Resource Accounting and Budgeting in Government, is out for
public consultation. Privately it is described as a 'white-green paper', as
there is no doubting the government's determination to go ahead with the
introduction of accrual accounting - or, as it is more commonly called -
'resource accounting.'.
The present system for government accounting is based on cash, in terms of
receipts and payments, and has been officially designated, by the
chancellor, as both 'archaic' and 'silly'. It records when money is spent on
an asset and then loses track of the asset itself: its future use,
depreciation, sale, or disposal.
In contrast accrual accounting is based on the recording of transactions
when they occur - rather than when the money is either received or paid out.
If this system sounds both sensible and familiar it is because it is the
foundation of UK company accounting - and has been introduced in local
government, the national health service, the universities, and privatised
industries.
Under such a scheme we could expect a government department to produce:
A set of consolidated accounts for itself and its executive agencies
A distinction between revenue and capital expenditure.
An operating cost statement, highlighting resources consumed during the year
net of department income from customers.
A balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, provisions and an analysis
of capital employed.
A cashflow statement, analysing capital and current cash outflows and
sources of finance.
An output and performance analysis, comparing actual outputs with targets.
A description of non-cash items such as depreciation of assets,
superannuation and insurance.
The New Zealand government has already introduced the system. In Australia,
it has been introduced at federal level and for the state governments of New
South Wales and Victoria.
The need for such a change must be seen in a broad context of government
reform. From compulsory competitive tendering, through the development of
the internal market in the National Health Service, to the setting up of
executive agencies to deliver services, the need for commercial accounting
is crucial in order to improve financial accountability and to ensure proper
comparisons of costs.
The great danger is that the new system will be enacted in form not
substance. For beyond accural accounting lies resource budgeting: a system
of management targets within a framework of measurable inputs and outputs.
In New Zealand, where such a revolution has been attempted, the accounting
switch was presented as the means to achieve a fundamental transformation of
the culture: a shift to business management.
Martin Evans, technical and research director of Cipfa - the public sector
accounting body - told a conference last week on the green paper: 'The
benefit of accrual accounting is that it confronts service managers with the
real cost of holding and using assets.'
'Quiet apart from highlighting the extent to which we are running down or
investing in public assets it may encourage more rational decisions about
the appropriate level of public borrowing.'
But then comes the warning. 'Resource accounting is not a magic wand that
will lead automatically to better management of government assets.' A
revolution is also needed in management if the next step, to resource
budgeting, is to be achieved. Some accountants watching the process fear
that there is a 'whitewash' option: that resource accounting will be
confined to the back of an envelope while the managment culture will remain
unchanged.
Francis Plowden, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, told the Cipfa conference
that success depended on a change in management culture which was already
under way: 'But the pace of change will need to be much greater if the
benefits of the changes in technique which we have been discussing are to
rise above the criticism that we are simply playing at shops.'
All this will not mean an end to cash controls. The paymaster general, David
Heathcote Amery MP, told the conference: 'Cash control within departments
should be as rigourous as ever. But it might be appropriate for the treasury
to exercise cash control for departments as a whole at a higher level of
aggregation - allowing more flexible use of resources whilst continuing to
keep a firm grip on the PSBR.'
This illustrates just how far reaching the shift to accrual accounting can
be. The Cipfa conference touched on some others: for example, if a
department's accounts are consolidated why should the financial affairs of a
quango not be included on the balance sheet ? While so-called executive
quangos do produce accounts, why should hundreds of others escape?
Regulation of the accounts is a live issue because under resource accounting
judgement will have to be used - particularly in respect to the valuation of
assets and their depreciation. How do you depreciate the value of a nuclear
bomb? As one accountant suggested: rather quickly after it goes off. How do
you apply historic cost accounting of a 14th century castle? Or a
battleship?
Under cash based accounting assets were effectively written off after
purchase. Under resource accounting the asset will suddenly reappear. How
could a government institution, housed in a fine building on a lucrative
piece of property, justify continuing to finance its asset? If it sold up,
who would get the money? The indications are that the Treasury would get
some, at least. Should the government attempt the seemingly horrendous task
of consolidating the accounts of the entire public sector?
While the problems seem huge Martin Evans, at least, is sure that they are
tractable. Furthermore there is widespread acknowledgement that the benefits
are huge. The glittering prize is that in the future a minister will be able
to ask his accountants to cost a series of options for providing a public
service.
When the dust settles the chancellor may well prove to have been right in
his uncharacteristically grand evaluation of the effects of applying simple,
old-fashioned, accrual accounting to the process of modern government.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Tories get into deep water on Scots reforms: A look at
mounting opposition to the council overhauls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the government seems close to abandoning hopes of achieving a radical
reform of local government in England, in Scotland plans for a complete
reorganisation should now move into a higher gear.
On Tuesday night the Commons approved the bill to replace the present
two-tier system in mainland Scotland with 28 single-tier authorities. Nine
regional councils and 53 district councils will disappear in April 1996. The
three island councils will be unchanged.
What was a small majority in the opinion polls backing single-tier councils
has over the past two years turned into one modestly against them. Many
thoughtful Scots doubt whether the new structure will be more effective and
cheaper to operate, and even Tories fear it will initially do little to
improve the party's standing in local government.
Whereas in England the government's desire for change has been thwarted by
strong support for the status quo, detected by Sir John Banham's travelling
commission, in Scotland and in Wales - where a single-tier structure also
comes into effect in April 1996 - there has been no such consultation.
However, creating a single-tier structure has long been on the agenda of the
Labour, Liberal and Scottish National parties but with the crucial proviso
that it followed the setting up of a Scottish parliament.
The unpopularity of the reforms to local government is partly due to the
fact that it entails removing water and sewerage from the control of local
authorities, an issue whose sensitivity in Scotland the government probably
underestimated. Water is not being privatised but will be handed over to
three publicly-owned companies which will contract out services to
private-sector companies.
The most sweeping change in the local government map is the abolition of
Strathclyde region, in which nearly half Scotland's 5m people live. It is to
be broken up into 12 unitary councils.
Strathclyde's break-up highlights the disadvantages of the government's
policy. Although the Strathclyde passenger transport executive will continue
to provide rail services in the Glasgow area, it will be under the control
of a number of unitary councils. ScotRail executives who operate the trains
do not conceal their misgivings at the prospect.
Strathclyde has an office in Brussels which has been very successful in
securing EU grants but could now disappear.
Critics of the scheme such as Professor Arthur Midwinter of Strathclyde
university say that if Scottish local government had to be reformed it would
have been efficient to create only 15 councils. But the desire to satisfy
local interests, break up Labour power blocks and preserve the few Tory ones
will mean the setting up of some tiny authorities which will be obliged to
provide a full range of services - Clackmannan, carved out of Central
region, will have only 49,000 people.
However the new local authorities - notably the four cities, Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee - are delighted to be receiving their
independence.
Although the Scottish Office argued that the reform would create significant
savings in public expenditure, the promised figure was gradually whittled
down under challenge from the regional councils. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish
secretary, eventually settled for saying that the reform would save Pounds
1bn over 15 years - a modest figure compared with current annual spending of
Pounds 6bn.
The government has set a tight timetable with elections next April for the
new councils which will have only 12 months as shadow bodies before taking
control. The tightness of the schedule was exacerbated by delays in getting
the bill through parliament and the fact that the big regions, mostly
Labour-controlled, offered minimum co-operation with the Scottish Office.
Mr Graeme Wallace, a local-government specialist with Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, said this week: 'It is difficult to conceive of members of a
newly elected shadow council, beset with all the problems of setting up a
new authority while running down an old one . . . rushing to embrace the
tenets of reinventing local government.'
The first moment of truth will come on April 9 next year with the shadow
council elections. It will be another test for the Conservative party whose
standing in the Scottish opinion polls is at rock bottom.
A calculation by The Herald newspaper yesterday suggests that the Tories
will be lucky to win control of more than two of the 28 new mainland
councils. Nearly half are likely to be once again won by Labour.

FT  03 NOV 94 / MPs step up calls over child agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on the government to reform the controversial Child Support Agency
increased yesterday with demands for change from MPs.
Members of the Commons social security committee were, however, divided over
how far the changes should go, and its recommendations came in for immediate
criticism.
The agency was set up to ensure that absent parents, usually fathers, make
proper financial support for their children. It was bitterly attacked during
its first year of operation for making unrealistic financial demands, and
for the poor quality of its administration. Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief
executive, resigned in September.
The committee calls in its report for special treatment for couples who
split up before the agency was established, reponding to complaints that it
had interfered with 'clean-break' settlements. The committee recommends
changes in the way earnings and maintenance are calculated, and improved
social security safety-net arrangements for single parents.
Although the committee's final report was unanimous, Conservative members
had earlier rejected proposals for further change, including an independent
appeals system and more beneficial financial arrangements for single and
absent parents.
The government is expected to revise the maintenance formula used by the
agency, but is unlikely to want to embark on the committee's wider programme
for change.
Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, emphasised that it
remained united in the view that establishing the agency, 'revolutionary as
it is', was right in principle. However, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social
security secretary, said the report would be 'condemned as tinkering with
the problem'.

FT  03 NOV 94 / US boosts contribution to Ulster capital fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process has been given another boost with the US
administration announcing a package of new measures to help the economy of
the province and Irish border counties.
Under the deal, Washington's annual contribution to the International Fund
for Ireland is to increase, subject to congressional approval, from Dollars
20m (Pounds 12.2m) in 1995-96 to Dollars 30m for each of the following two
years. The increases will take the total commitment of the Clinton
administration to the fund to Dollars 100m.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said: 'I am delighted that
Northern Ireland is still at the top of the agenda of the American
president.'
Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, said: 'This
is a very welcome announcement by Mr Clinton and confirms the undertakings
which he previously gave to help build on the peace. I deeply appreciate the
involvement which the president has shown and I am very aware of his
willingness to assist us economically.'
In addition President Clinton has said he will personally host an
international trade and investment conference on Ireland next April in
Philadelphia.
It was also announced that Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, will be in
Belfast for the investment conference organised by the UK government in
December. Mr Brown will go on to Dublin for talks.
Forty US companies are already operating in Northern Ireland providing 9,000
jobs.
The International Fund for Ireland, set up in 1986 by the US and the
European Union, last year stood at Pounds 225m. The body provides venture
capital for small and medium sized businesses in the province's most
depressed areas. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs.
There was a more guarded welcome for the package from the Ulster Unionist
party.
Mr James Wilson, the party's general secretary, said: 'Financial aid is
always welcome provided it is fairly distributed in the province and
provided it is directed to areas of real need and in support of real jobs.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / National Insurance computer to go private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new Pounds 150m computer system to hold records on National Insurance
contributors is to be financed and operated by the private sector.
The government is seeking private investors to develop, test and operate a
replacement for the ageing National Insurance Recording System, one of the
largest computer systems in Europe.
The aim is to have the new system in place by April 1997 when extensive
government pension reforms are expected to come into effect.
The project will be the first of its kind to be funded through the
government's private-finance initiative, which aims to encourage
private-sector investment in the delivery of public services.
If successful it could provide a model for the way the government handles
other large investments in information technology. Bidders are expected to
come from the ranks of large private information technology companies.
As presently envisaged, the successful bidder would bear the entire initial
capital cost of the project, meaning that the investment would not count
towards the public sector borrowing requirement.
The bidder would aim to recoup its investment and generate a profit by
charging a small fee for every transaction to users - principally the
Department of Social Security's Contributions Agency, which is responsible
for collecting and recording National Insurance contributions.
Bidding companies will therefore be taking a commercial risk both on the
future volume of transactions and the amount of spare capacity they decide
to build into the new system.
The government is expected to try to build in an incentive for the
successful bidder to keep its technology up to date by awarding a contract
for a period of between five and 10 years, and not the entire anticipated
lifespan of the system.
The present magnetic tape-based system holds more than 61m National
Insurance records. According to the Contributions Agency, the 20-year-old
system is beginning to show its age and limitations.
The private-finance initiative was launched about two years ago by Mr Norman
Lamont, then chancellor, but has so far been slow to take off.
It is still not clear that the government is prepared to countenance the
rates of return required to mobilise the private sector to meet needs that
have traditionally been met by the public services.
Some civil servants have also appeared to have unrealistic views about the
degree of risk that the private sector is prepared to assume in
infrastructure projects.

FT  03 NOV 94 / New form for assessing tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tax form designed to help 9m people assess their payments is launched
today in draft form by the Inland Revenue.
The form is a crucial part of the government's plan to shift to
self-assessment - the biggest change in tax collection since the
introduction of PAYE half a century ago.
A thousand volunteers will receive the new form and have a month to complete
and return it to the 30 tax offices taking part in the study.
The form incorporates one radical departure. Instead of all taxpayers
getting the same bulky form, each will be targeted with specific returns
tailored to their tax history.
Self-assessment starts in 1997 and will mean that those currently sending in
tax forms, either personally or through agents, will be able to use the new
form.
It will involve the self-employed, business partners, company directors and
some employees and pensioners. It will not affect the 20m taxpayers who use
PAYE.
Initial research showed that people did not like elaborate forms which often
contained irrelevant sections. They also completed the form in two sessions.
First they found out what information was needed. Then they completed the
form.
As a result the new form has a guide which should meet the needs of
taxpayers trying to assess what they need to know and what they need to
complete.
A market research programme of interviews will be undertaken with those
taking part in the scheme.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Adverts called for on BBC2
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC2 should be allowed to accept advertising and sponsorship, the
Incorporated Society of British Advertisers said yesterday in response to
the government's white paper on the future of the BBC.
A mixture of funding from the licence fee and advertisers would enable the
corporation to compete effectively with growing satellite and multimedia
rivals, said the society, which represents many of the UK's largest
advertisers.
Mr Kenneth Miles, the society's director-general, said all other 'leading
countries in Europe now have mixed funding for state channels, with
advertising as a major source of income'.
The society wants to see BBC1 continue to be funded through the licence fee,
while BBC2 would operate with advertising and sponsorship. The white paper,
published in July, reinforced the current universal licence fee arrangements
until at least 2001.
Separately, the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, accused the BBC
of mirroring the commercial sector in its programming. It added: 'Why should
licence payers be obliged to fund programmes that would, in the absence of
the BBC, be provided by commercial broadcasters?'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Companies 'no longer fear' Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are less fearful of the effect a Labour government would have on
business, a survey published today shows.
Ninety corporate treasurers responded to the survey, conducted annually by
Record Treasury Management, an independent company which advises businesses
on currency and other financial risks.
One in five treasurers believed the election of a Labour government would
improve prospects for economic growth, while only 31 per cent believed that
prospects would worsen. Nearly half the sample thought there would be little
difference.
The findings indicate a 'marked shift in attitude', according to Mr Les
Halpin, chief executive of Record.
Previous surveys have shown a bias in favour of Conservative government
policy. Mr Halpin said: 'Most companies no longer fear that Labour will be
severely detrimental to the economy.'
The survey shows that corporate treasurers - the executives who manage
day-to-day financial risks - believe low inflation should be the main
priority for government policy. Fifty three per cent of respondents ranked
low inflation as a priority compared with 40 per cent a year ago.
Fewer treasurers attach priority importance to other objectives such as
reduced unemployment - from 24 per cent last year to 15 per cent - and the
stimulation of demand - down from 14 per cent to 11 per cent.
Although 81 per cent believe that inflation is under control in the short
term, just 16 per cent accept that inflation is under control in the long
term. 'It is taking a long time for them to be convinced that inflation is
under control,' said Mr Halpin.
Most treasurers are pessimistic about interest-rate trends. A total of 90
per cent expect interest rates in the UK to rise over the next year, and 93
per cent expect US rates to go up.
The survey also indicated that there are some grounds for concern about the
use by companies of derivatives - financial instruments whose value is based
at least partly on some underlying asset such as bonds, equities or
commodities. Although nine out of 10 treasurers use derivatives, more than
half of these believe the banks which sell them are not adequately
explaining the risks involved.
Thirty six per cent of respondents said sellers explain derivatives products
'inadequately' and a further 18 per cent 'poorly'.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Shephard orders overhaul of careers advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government curriculum advisers have been asked to overhaul careers advice in
secondary education, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary,
announced yesterday.
Her move is part of a package of measures, launched jointly with the
employment secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, to improve careers advice.
She said there would be more funding for training careers teachers -
although she could not give an amount before the Budget - and schools would
be required to plan careers policy jointly with local employers and careers
services.
Ministers have rejected proposals by employers' organisations to introduce
vouchers for careers guidance.
Mrs Shephard said she had asked Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the School
Curriculum and Assessment Authority, to produce new guidelines for careers
guidance in secondary education.
She said that 'young people from the age of 11 do need to understand that
they are aiming for the world of work'.
Careers services, which are directly funded by the Department of Employment,
claimed that schools were not providing impartial advice but they were
influenced by funding incentives to recruit students to A-level courses,
rather than sending them to do vocational courses with further education
colleges, which compete with them for funds.
Mr Mike Eastwood, from the UK Heads of Career Services Association, claimed
there was 'evidence that some head teachers, because of the amount of money
flowing from having a young person in their sixth form, are very loath to
have unbiased guidance from school careers service officers'.
This follows last month's report by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, and by the
Further Education Funding Council for England, which said too many
sixth-formers were attempting inappropriate academic A-level courses, and
should be encouraged to take vocational qualifications instead.
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, said that careers advice
was being hampered by the government's 'market dogma'. He added:
'Commercialising careers services has brought uncertainty and confusion to
an area in which quality and consistency of advice are essential.'
But Mr Tony Webb, the Confederation of British Industry's education
director, said he was pleased with the package.
He added that the partnership approach was realistic, given that there were
not yet enough providers of careers advice for a fully competitive market.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Roads budget faces cut of Pounds 400m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, is resisting the implementation
of savage cuts in his department's budget, amid signs that the Treasury is
looking to reduce spending on next year's roads programme by up to Pounds
400m.
Although the government's public expenditure survey is due to be completed
in the next few days, Department of Transport officials have made
last-minute attempts to resist reductions of up to 20 per cent in the annual
expenditure on motorways and highways.
DoT officials have told the Treasury a cut of this magnitude would be
excessive, threatening maintenance for existing routes.
However, Dr Mawhinney and his colleagues have accepted that the annual
Pounds 2bn roads programme will have to be cut and that reductions cannot be
confined to the budgets for 1996-97 and 1997-98.
They have also decided that reductions in the annual road building budget
must mainly hit new projects and that plans to construct urban by-passes and
smaller routes are to be continued.
Earlier this year Mr John MacGregor, the then transport secretary, cut the
number of big roads projects to just six.
The DoT has agreed to build the M1 to M62 link road near Leeds. But cuts
could threaten five other projects. These are the M1-A1 link road at Leeds,
the A6/M56 Manchester Airport link west, the A102 third crossing at
Blackwall under the Thames, the A31 Poole link road in Dorset and the Poole
Harbour crossing.
The onslaught on the roads budget comes amid clear indications that Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will impose a tough public expenditure round
in his Budget later this month.
In recent weeks Dr Mawhinney has signalled that he wants to implement more
environmentally-friendly policies and that this could lead to a renewed
focus on public transport.
However, he and colleagues have warned the Treasury that up to Pounds 1bn of
the annual roads budget is spent on the maintenance of existing routes, and
that any reductions in the budget will therefore affect the quality of
existing roads.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Business 'bounce back' reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Optimism about trading prospects over the next year is rising among
medium-sized companies, which are bouncing back strongly from the recession,
National Westminster Bank said yesterday.
Medium-sized businesses - those with sales of between Pounds 1m and Pounds
130m - are once again net borrowers after three years spent repaying debt
and reducing overdrafts, the bank says in a quarterly survey.
However, recovery in some sectors such as retailing is still 'patchy', with
profit margins under severe pressure, it warns.
But in aggregate the medium-sized companies are increasing net long-term
borrowing more quickly than they are reducing overdrafts, the bank says.
Businesses in this category account for 30 per cent of gross domestic
product in the UK and employ 8m people, nearly 40 per cent of the
non-government labour force.
As a result of downsizing and outsourcing by companies with sales of more
than Pounds 130m, the medium-sized companies' importance was growing both in
terms of share of GDP and share of employment.
Three quarters expect their businesses to do better next year and two thirds
believe the economy will improve. A significant number of these companies
expect to increase employment over the next three months.
Part of the survey was based on a survey of NatWest bankers dealing with
these medium-sized companies. They said the sector's overall growth was not
at present constrained by lack of access to capital.
'Lack of finance is now not the issue,' said Mr Kevin Jennings, director of
commercial marketing. 'Over the last few months getting orders has been the
real issue for companies with sales of Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Questions remain over Pounds 61m Hualon grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board made a Pounds
61m grant to Hualon of Taiwan to build a Belfast textiles plant, it has been
coy about publishing details of the controversial project.
According to Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, who resigned as an outside director of the
board yesterday in protest at the deal, the development board's own
executives have been almost as parsimonious in supplying hard facts to the
directors to whom they are supposedly accountable.
'I have scrabbled for information. I have spent a great deal of time trying
to get answers. I resigned because I cannot get to the bottom of this
thing,' she said yesterday. 'We cannot commit Pounds 61m of taxpayers' money
to something as nebulous as this.'
Mrs d'Abo, who made a fortune in the 1980s by turning around the Rymans
stationery chain and selling it for Pounds 20m to Pentos, the bookshops
group, said she had queried the Hualon project since it first went to the
IDB board in September 1992.
Her suspicions were aroused by the fact that Mr Oung Ta-ming, Hualon's
effective head, and his brother Mr Oung You-ming, had shortly before been
charged in connection with a stock trading scandal. The former received a
three-and-a-half year jail sentence, later overturned, while the latter fled
to Malaysia, where he still lives.
She became even more worried by uncertainties about the legal and financial
arrangements for the project. It was unclear, she said, which part of the
sprawling Hualon group would be responsible for it, what financial
guarantees it would put up and who stood behind them.
'One of the key reasons I am resigning is that I still don't know who the
IDB is doing this deal with,' she said.
In June last year she wrote to Mr Tim Smith, then Northern Ireland minister,
saying she was so concerned that she did not wish to be reappointed when her
three-year term at the development board expired at the end of this year.
At a lunch last August, she said, Mr Smith said he also wanted more
information, notably about the legal position of the Oung brothers. He
arranged a meeting with Mr John McGuckian, IDB chairman, and senior staff
later in the month.
Mrs d'Abo was dissatisfied with the answers she received at the later
meeting and pressed for further information. Though she had been given more
documents, including the agreement under which Hualon accepted the IDB's
Pounds 61m in aid, she said they raised still more questions.
Among the points which Mrs d'Abo said remained unclear were:
Whether the development board was dealing with the Hualon Corporation in
Taiwan, its Malaysian subsidiary headed by Mr Oung You-ming, or Textonnia, a
Northern Ireland shell company set up by Hualon in connection with the
project.
On October 11, Mr Frank Hewitt, IDB deputy chief executive, told Mrs d'Abo
that Hualon had not decided on the vehicle for funding the project. But two
days later Mr George Foster, IDB executive director, told her the IDB was
dealing with the Taiwanese Hualon group.
The status of financial guarantees. When Hualon accepted the IDB's aid offer
last May, she said, it undertook to inject at least Pounds 2.5m in cash into
Textonnia two months after the deal was signed.
But by the time she resigned, Mrs d'Abo said, none of the money had been
paid. Mr Philip Chu, one of two directors of Hualon Malaysia who signed the
undertaking, was not mentioned as a director of Textonnia. She was also
unsure who Textonnia's shareholders were.
The legal status of the IDB's deal with Hualon. Mrs d'Abo doubted that the
funding contract for the project was still valid because of Hualon's
apparent failure to put up the promised funds and because of delays caused
by the possibility that the European Commission's approval of the aid this
year might face a legal challenge from the UK textile industry.
The IDB said yesterday the vehicle for the investment was Textonnia, which
it said had paid up share capital of Pounds 100,000 and was owned by a
company called Texton.
Mrs d'Abo did not recall the project being put to a formal vote by the
board. Instead, she said, Mr McGuckian, as chairman, simply noted in his
summing up at a board meeting that all directors had agreed to it.
In spite of her doubts, she did not oppose the project outright at the time.
'I did not have the guts or all the information I needed,' she said.
However, after another Taiwanese stock market scandal last month - allegedly
involving Mr Oung Ta-ming, several senior Hualon executives and two
brokerage houses linked to the group - she asked Mr McGuckian to hold a
special board meeting to review the project. He turned down her request.
The last straw, she said, was when she asked a fellow IDB director to raise
questions about the stock trading affair at a board meeting last week which
she could not attend. She said the inquiries were simply brushed aside.
'I suddenly decided enough was enough. I was being stonewalled, and nobody
was listening to me,' she said yesterday. She hoped her resignation would
prompt a full public inquiry into the project.
'I'm all for creating new jobs but only if we have got the right partner,'
she said. That lesson, she added, had been learned at huge cost from the
collapse in the late 1970s of the De Lorean car venture.

FT  03 NOV 94 / BAT warns of challenge over pension liability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries, which owns insurers Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, yesterday
said it might issue a legal challenge to regulators' plans for paying
compensation to people who followed poor advice to take a personal pension.
Mr Martin Broughton, group chief executive, said BAT believed that life
companies operating through direct sales forces - as Allied Dunbar largely
does - should not have any compensation liability for investors who have
been wrongly advised by independent financial advisers which then go out of
business.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, last week
published a report on identifying and compensating people who had been
wrongly sold personal pensions.
It said that life companies and advisers should review at least 350,000
cases within the next two years. Some estimates put the bill at up to Pounds
2bn.
SIB did not say how the retail financial services sector should divide the
cost of compensating the victims of independent advisers which are unable to
meet their liabilities, and life companies are arguing fiercely about how
the expense should be split.
Mr Broughton said: 'We might finish up taking the SIB or somebody to court
if direct sellers were asked to pick up some of the spread of liabilities
for independent advisers. We would take every step to avoid that.'
SIB is already discussing a narrower point with Sun Life, another life
insurer. Sun Life, which does 90 per cent of its business through
independent advisers, says legal advice casts doubts on whether it will have
to contribute compensation in respect of independent advisers which have
already gone out of business.
Mr Les Owen, Sun Life chief general manager, said the insurer was also
taking legal advice about the duties of the trustees of occupational pension
schemes.
Mr Broughton emphasised that Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star would provide
compensation where they had mis-sold pensions.
He estimated the administrative cost to the two companies of identifying
potential victims as between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m over the next two
years.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Solvency rules set to be diluted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is planning to make significant concessions to employers in
its pension reform legislation by watering down solvency requirements that
could have forced schemes to sell shares and buy UK government securities.
It is understood that a reference to the legislation will be contained in
the Queen's Speech later this month and that a bill will be presented in the
second week of December.
In a white paper issued in June, it was proposed that each occupational
pension scheme hold enough assets to be able to provide members with the
'cash equivalent' of their accrued pension entitlements. The amount of cash
needed to provide future benefits is dependent upon the rate of interest
earned in the years before retirement. Actuaries use returns on gilts as the
basis for such calculations because, unlike equity investments, the return
on a particular gilt can be calculated with some certainty over time.
Employers, who on average hold 80 per cent of their portfolios in UK and
international equities, feared the white paper proposals would involve their
schemes switching from equities into gilts. They could also involve making
significant cash injections into the schemes.
The government now intends to allow returns on equities to be used for
calculating cash equivalents for people within 10 years of their retirement
date. Only holdings of UK equities will count for this purpose.
A source familiar with the proposals said yesterday that although the
changes represented current government thinking, they had not yet been
etched in stone.
The government also intends that returns on equities be used to calculate
the value of assets needed to pay cash equivalents to existing pensioners.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Which? hits at high bank charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High street banks and the Consumers' Association have clashed over the
latest Which? survey on the cost of borrowing, Alison Smith writes.
The association says that a combination of charges on unauthorised
overdrafts and interest levied on such accounts for even short periods can
be equivalent to millions of per cent if translated to an annualised
percentage rate basis.
It argues that the high levels of interim profits reported by the banks
intensifies the argument that they should cut their charges. It says there
are sharp differences in the range of charges imposed by banks and building
societies that offer current accounts, and urges customers facing high
charges to move.
The British Bankers' Association said the banks' interim results showed that
providing banking services for personal customers was 'one of the most
unprofitable activities which banks undertake'. It emphasised that more than
three quarters of personal customers do not pay charges.

Around one in six life insurance companies still showed serious weaknesses
and flaws in the second round of routine inspection visits by financial
watchdogs, the annual report by Lautro on the sector's regulation says.
The report, published today, describes the result as a 'disappointment'
although it notes that the position has improved since the earlier round of
inspections when a third of life insurers failed regulators' scrutiny.
Record fines of Pounds 300,000 were imposed earlier this year on Norwich
Union and on Premium Life, and the life industry has been warned for several
months that continuing failures would be severely penalised.
The report from Lautro, which has now been succeeded as life insurance
regulator by the Personal Investment Authority (PIA), shows the extent of
contraction in the life insurance sector, with the number of sales agents
acting directly for life companies dropping by more than a third to below
94,000 at the end of June. In July 1991 it was more than twice that number.
The document admits that plans for inspections were disrupted considerably
for nine weeks in the spring by the setting up of the PIA. This involved
training monitoring staff and then working on the process of approving
organisations for acceptance by the new regulator.
Lautro says there have been some signs of improvement in standards, citing
the shift in the causes of disciplinary action away from harm inflicted on
investors towards the risk of harm, and the fact that the number of
investigations was only about half that of the previous 12 months.
It notes, however, that there has been an increase in the number of
complaints - to 7,143 from 5,775 in the period covered by last year's
report.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Holman Hunt replica sold for Pounds 1.87m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quarter-size replica of William Holman Hunt's 'The Shadow of Death'
realised Pounds 1.87m at Sotheby's, London, setting a new auction record for
a pre-Raphaelite picture and the third highest auction price for a Victorian
painting. The replica was made by Hunt for the use of the engraver.
The same bidder also paid Pounds 166,500 for DG Rossetti's portrait in
chalks of his sister, the poet Christina Rossetti.
London dealers McConnal Mason, who have frequently acted for composer Sir
Andrew Lloyd Webber, paid a record Pounds 551,500 for Poynter's highly
erotic sirens of 'The Cave of the Storm Nymphs' although the painting was
last seen at auction six years ago when it fetched Pounds 440,000. Mr David
Mason also bid a record Pounds 168,700 for the Pre-Raphaelite James
Collinson's 'The Emigration Scheme'.
Albert Moore's tribute to the art of music fared less well and was bought in
at Pounds 500,000. The sale totalled Pounds 4,520,849 with 79.5 per cent
sold by value.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Battle fought from behind enemy lines: A look at the union
campaign against privatising the Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union, and his
senior colleagues are keen to avoid celebrating over the government's
disarray on privatising the Post Office.
But sitting round the table at the union's London headquarters yesterday,
with their advisers from consultants Lowe Bell, they were looking back with
satisfaction on the most effective and professional campaign by a British
union for a long time.
'We could have followed the traditional way of opposition - handing out
leaflets, holding protest meetings, going on marches, threatening strikes
and setting up a sub-committee of the committed. It would have been amateur
hour,' Mr Johnson said.
The union dispatched stickers, leaflets, balloons and cards as well as
handing in a petition to Downing Street with 1.75m signatures but recognised
this would not be enough.
'We were determined to win, not organise a glorious defeat,' Mr Johnson
said. This meant running a focused, professional campaign not simply to
mobilise public opinion but to win over the Conservative heartland and so
deprive the government of its slender parliamentary majority. 'We had to
cross political frontiers and get behind the enemy lines.'
Over the past four months this meant hiring Lowe Bell Political, an arm of
the consultants linked closely in the past with the Conservative party
machine. Mr Johnson said: 'Working with Lowe Bell has enabled us to get to
people we would otherwise would not have been able to do.' It even enabled
the union to penetrate Conservative Central Office to take part in a meeting
of the Conservative Political Centre.
But Lowe Bell's role should not be exaggerated. The union started its
anti-privatisation campaign in July 1992 when Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, first decided to review the ownership of the Post
Office.
Mr Daniel Harris, communications officer, said: 'Public opinion has been
against Post Office privatisation from the start. We harnessed an existing
sympathetic mood.'
Ms Julia Simpson, head of communications, said: 'We have a positive message:
to see the highly profitable and popular Post Office stay in the public
sector but with new commercial freedom.'
The union campaign also set the pace with the help of discontented Post
Office managers who have fed the union with a series of embarrassing
internal documents to put Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, on
the defensive.
The union was kept informed by its contacts over the progress of the
privatisation plans inside the cabinet committee.
In May it was able to exploit knowledge of government hesitations to press
the case for a consultative rather than a white paper on the issue.
The first taste of success came when union leaders learnt that Mr John
Major, the prime minister, had insisted that the union's policy option for
the Post Office should be included in Mr Heseltine's green paper.
The union has also widened its campaign by forming alliances with Women's
Institutes and campaigners for the preservation of rural England. And the
union's members, with their unique access to the public, were vital to the
campaign.
The champagne may still be on ice at union headquarters but it believes the
government's problems are due to its own efforts.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Ministers refuse fax explanation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers last night refused to explain a delay of nearly six months in
initiating action against The Guardian newspaper for using a fake
parliamentary fax to investigate the stay by Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury
chief secretary, at the Ritz hotel in Paris.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, rejected attempts by Labour back benchers
to block a Commons probe. They had claimed that any inquiry should have been
initiated as soon as the government was made aware of the doctored fax.
MPs approved by a majority of 275 (313-38) a motion which ensures that Mr
Peter Preston, the editor of The Guardian, will have to appear before the
privileges committee.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said there was a suspicion that
the government had hoped to secure a political advantage by not taking
action in May when it first knew of the 'forged letter'.
He suggested that ministers took the view that 'in extremis' their knowledge
of the forged letter would keep The Guardian quiet about asking all sorts of
questions about other matters.
Mr Norman Godman, Labour MP for Greenock and Port Glasgow, said the delay
was unacceptable'. He added: 'I believe there is some kind of cover up.'
Labour's frontbench team joined the government and voted in favour of the
issue being referred to the committee.
Mr David Wilshire, Conservative MP for Spelthorne, who led the demands for
an inquiry by the privileges committee, said the methods used by The
Guardian were at best 'ethically flawed'. At worst they were 'downright
criminal' and amounted to a flagrant abuse of the Commons.
Mr Wilshire attacked Mr Preston for failing to offer a proper apology. To
cheers from Tory back benchers, he said: 'Over the past few days the nation
has been treated to the mocking of decency and honesty and the attempted
justification of deceit.'
Mr Ian Bruce, Tory MP for South Dorset, described what had happened as a
'conspiracy by Mr Preston to try to hide the fact that he was working with a
blackmailer in trying to bring down this government'.
Mr Roger Gale, Tory MP for Thanet North and chairman of his party's
backbench media committee, hoped that Mr Preston would be subject to
criminal charges. He had written to the board of The Guardian to ask whether
Mr Preston retained its confidence.
Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery, supported the reference
to the committee, but insisted that The Guardian should be congratulated for
highlighting the behaviour of MPs when it was a legitimate matter of public
interest.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Political Notebook: The surreal world of Major's enemy
within
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So now we know. It is all Mr John Major's fault. Everything. 'Sleaze',
ministerial sojourns at the Ritz, high taxes, rising crime rates, Sir Leon
Brittan's demotion, confusion over the Post Office, the chaos at the Child
Support Agency. That of course is a severely abridged list.
How can we be so sure that the prime minister alone must shoulder the blame?
Easy. Just spend a few minutes in the lobbies and bars of the House of
Commons. It is there, not on the opposition benches of the Commons chamber,
that Mr Major's real enemies still gather.
They sit on the government back benches. They call themselves the Tory
right. They are available any day, any hour: ready to whisper with
ill-concealed glee and synthetic resignation how once again Mr Major has
made a hash of it.
The issue that originally brought them together - Europe - has temporarily
slipped down the agenda during the pause between Maastricht and the 1996
intergovernmental conference. But it will return. And the bile and
bitterness remain.
The raison d'etre of these self-styled guardians of the Thatcherite flame is
simple: to denigrate the prime minister. They never miss a chance.
In this surreal world the abrupt return to their ranks of the sacked
industry minister Mr Neil Hamilton is almost a cause for celebration. Mr
Hamilton may be a fellow-traveller in trouble. But the manner of his
departure hands them yet another stick with which to beat Mr Major. And now,
of course, Mr Hamilton is free to say what he really thinks of the prime
minister in whose government he served.
The two dozen Tory MPs who peddle the poison in the Commons corridors of
course are only a fragment of what was once recognisable as the party's
right wing. The battle over Maastricht provided the illusion of a coherent
power bloc. But in reality the Tory right has fractured and divided since
the departure of Baroness Thatcher.
Its thinkers - Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr John Redwood and Mr
Michael Forsyth - are in government, bound - if sometimes only loosely - by
the gag of collective responsibility. The heavyweights of the 1980s have
retired hurt to the House of Lords. With the honourable exception of
intellectuals such as Mr John Biffen and clever mavericks such as Mr
Nicholas Budgen, that leaves little firepower on the back benches.
Take the most bitter malcontents. One or two have influence among less
committed colleagues. A few of the younger ones can look forward one day to
a career in government - maybe. But the rest are never-has-beens or
never-will-be's, the flotsam and jetsam of a party in power for 16 years.
Sir George Gardiner, Mr John Townend, Mr John Carlisle and the like profess
to worship the memory of Lady Thatcher. But she would not have them in her
administrations. Nor will any other Tory prime minister, left, right or
centre.
Now, their views - crudely populist as well as intellectually inconsistent -
are treated with mild embarrassment by their mentors in Mr Major's cabinet.
Sir George wants income tax cuts now and billions slashed at a stroke from
the welfare budget. Mr Portillo, his idol, dismisses as absurd the notion
that a Conservative government could cut taxes while it is borrowing Pounds
30bn a year. Meanwhile, he is busy defending his employment budget from the
Treasury axe.
Messrs Portillo, Lilley, and Redwood are no friends of the prime minister,
and regard him as weak. They nurture the power base on the back benches
which prevents him from sacking any of them.
But they are interested in winning the intellectual argument, not in
sticking pins into Mr Major or in seeing him replaced in 10 Downing Street
by Mr Kenneth Clarke.
Among the younger irreconcilables - the self-styled Essex right of the 1992
intake - there are a handful interested in argument as well as sniping.
Mr Iain Duncan-Smith is respected by those who mix in the same circles. Mr
John Whittingdale speaks with the experience of several years as a close
assistant to Lady Thatcher.
But by and large the young malcontents are sure of little else but their
dislike of Mr Major and a hatred of Brussels. Britain can and should be
great again. But it is not their role to explain how.
Therein lies the danger for Mr Major. His enemies are not susceptible to
rational argument. They are not interested in the politics of pragmatism
required to hold the Tory coalition together.
They have no credible alternative, but they would delight in the destruction
of the prime minister. They expect the forthcoming battle over Europe to
provide the opportunity, by widening the net of discontent on the back
benches and rebuilding the illusion of unity and intellectual coherence on
the right. But watch out Mr Major - any excuse will do.

FT  03 NOV 94 / 'Misled' economists rap Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A squabble developed yesterday between City economists and the Bank of
England over what analysts saw as the misleading signals which accompanied
the publication of the Bank's quarterly inflation report on Tuesday.
The initial reaction of many economists was that the report meant that
interest rates did not need to increase. But national newspapers, following
an off-the-record briefing, reported that interest rates were likely to rise
over the next few months.
'The briefing is clearly designed to make the conclusions of the report more
clear,' said Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers. 'But if
they're going to do a briefing, they should make it on the record or put
their comments directly in the report.'
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'If you're going to
produce an on-the-record statement to the markets in the form of an
inflation report, why would you want to embellish that with an
off-the-record briefing? It greatly diminishes the status of the inflation
report.'
Mr Davies wants the Bank to follow the practice of the German Bundesbank
which normally holds on-the-record press briefings when it wants to make an
announcement.
The Bank was also accused of misleading the markets in August and September,
when its actions in the money markets were interpreted as giving false
signals on movements in interest rates.
'The Bank has confused the market three times - in August and September with
signals over rate changes - and this time, which is the least serious,' said
Mr Stephen Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell. However, Mr Bell said
the Bank should continue to give off-the-record briefings.
The problem of different interpretations also followed the August inflation
report, when newspaper headlines again concentrated on a likely rise in
interest rates, to the surprise of many economists. Base rates were duly
increased in September.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said: 'It would be
good for the markets if there was a bit more transparency.'
Wire services have difficulty reporting off-the-record statements because
they have to source all their quotes. The Bank has banned one agency,
Markets News Service, from attending future briefings after it attributed a
quote to Bank of England 'sources', a breach of the rules governing such
briefings.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Blair to review voluntary sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair last night ordered a thorough review of Labour's policies on
the voluntary sector, saying he wanted to propose 'a new deal' between
voluntary organisations and the government.
The Labour leader called for a middle path between the left's old belief in
state intervention and the right's view that voluntary bodies relieved the
government of its own responsibilities. Labour had learnt from the mistakes
of the past. 'The state does not have the solution to every problem. Nor do
people want the state to intervene in all areas of life,' he said.
Offering one or two hints as to what the conclusions of the review might be,
Mr Blair said the proposed new deal must be based on a recognition that the
voluntary sector was not a 'cut-price alternative to statutory provision'.
'Why should the state provide all the training for the unemployed when
voluntary organisations in many cases are providing innovative schemes,' he
said.
The review is to be conducted by Mr Alun Michael, the shadow home affairs
minister, a staunch Blair loyalist.

FT  03 NOV 94 / GCHQ plans cut of up to 500 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GCHQ, the government's secret communications centre at Cheltenham, yesterday
announced it would shed 300 to 500 jobs over the next three years.
The centre, which employs about 6,000 people, said it hoped to achieve most
of the job losses through non-replacement and voluntary redundancies. Two
hundred jobs have already gone over the past two years.
GCHQ blamed the cuts on a 'tightening of the purse strings' throughout the

FT  03 NOV 94 / Judge tells jury to clear manager
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A manager of a City investment company who was accused of making multiple
share applications was cleared yesterday on the orders of a judge.
Mr Stuart Fisher allegedly promised 'beer and curry' to colleagues so he
could use their names to cash in illegally on the privatisation of the power
industry in 1991.
But the case was thrown out of Southwark Crown Court after Mr Ken McDonald,
acting for the defence, told Judge Eugene Cotran that the Crown had failed
to make its case.
He said there was no evidence to back prosecution allegations that Mr
Fisher, a contracts manager for Gartmore Investment Management, had
illegally pocketed profits from the flotations of the generating companies.
During legal argument at the close of the prosecution case, Mr McDonald said
all those whom Mr Fisher had assisted to make share applications had said
they had received all the money due to them.
The judge directed the jury to return not guilty verdicts on each of the
four counts of obtaining property by deception and three of attempting to
obtain property by deception which Mr Fisher had denied.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
M&amp;G, the independent unit trust company, says the London Stock Exchange's
proposed Alternative Investment Market will not be suitable for the
investors who buy its retail products because of the low level of regulation
and disclosure.
M&amp;G is one of several leading managers of unit trusts which have expressed
concern over the proposed market, which is intended to replace the Unlisted
Securities Market at the end of 1996. M&amp;G's objections are significant
because it has developed expertise in small-company share investment.
Mr Jonathan Bartlett, who manages M&amp;G's smaller companies unit trust, said:
'We don't believe it is right for unit trust holders to invest in these kind
of stocks. There may be investors there but they won't be M&amp;G unit holders.'
Professional groups of institutional investors, including the Association of
British Insurers, have told the Stock Exchange of their concerns that the
proposals offer too little investor protection to encourage significant
investment in the smallest companies.
However, small companies have been urging the exchange to devise a mechanism
to replace the USM which will help them raise capital at a lower cost than
seeking a place on the exchange's official list.

comparison, 71 per cent of all working age women were active in the economy
as opposed to 66 per cent in 1984.

Health authorities in Wales are to be cut from 17 to five in a
reorganisation which Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, claims will
eventually save Pounds 3m a year, Roland Adburgham writes.
The changes, which will need legislation, are planned for April 1996. They
will involve the merger of district and family health service authorities.
Mr Redwood said he aimed to reduce expenditure on management and
administrative costs in favour of spending on direct patient care.
The reorganisation follows consultation which Mr Redwood said showed a broad
consensus on amalgamating the district and family health service
authorities. The boundaries of the new authorities would be compatible with
those of the planned unitary councils in Wales.

Mr Laurie Brereton, Australia's transport minister, yesterday said he would
meet his New Zealand counterpart, Mr Maurice Williamson, next week to
discuss an aviation dispute between the two countries. Mr Brereton also
stressed that a memorandum of understanding, which would have allowed Air
New Zealand to fly domestic Australian routes from November 1, had not been
cancelled.
A row erupted last week when the Australian government announced
unilaterally that it was 'freezing' the memorandum for an unspecified period
on the grounds that some of the conditions had not been fully complied with.
This prompted speculation that the Australian government was trying to
protect the flotation of its 75 per cent interest in Qantas, due next year.

The Lome convention, the treaty under which the European Union grants trade
and aid concessions to the former European colonies, will not survive the
century in its current exclusive form, a senior EU official said yesterday.
Mr Peter Pooley, director-general of the development directorate, said in
London: 'I don't see Lome lasting as an exclusive club beyond the end of the
century.' The EU this year began to negotiate the fifth Lome accord with
developing country governments, but he said: 'If there is a Lome V, it will
be a more generalised one.' There was no reason to exclude such countries as
Bangladesh from the convention, he said.
A new accord would also seek to differentiate between countries of different
development levels, and differentiate one region from another, he said. Lome
IV was agreed as the Berlin Wall was falling, but failed to take account of
the consequences.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: India seeks private capital for toll roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India is turning to private investors in an attempt to give a huge boost to
developing its primitive road network.
The government is issuing letters of intent worth Dollars 50m for the
construction of three private sector-operated toll roads and one bridge  - a
first step towards attracting private capital into an industry long
dominated by the state.
The four schemes are among about 30 projects totalling over Dollars 6bn,
including Dollars 5.8bn worth of motorways, earmarked by the ministry for
surface transport for possible private sector development. Companies would
build roads and bridges, collect tolls to recoup their investment for a
fixed period and then transfer ownership to the state.
The ministry's plans are an extension of the government's efforts to
liberalise the economy and to expand India's infrastructure after years of
underinvestment.
Officials say 42 companies have expressed interest in build-operate-transfer
schemes, including Renong, Malaysia's largest business group, which has
suggested investing up to Dollars 25bn building a 12,000 kilometre national
motorway network. Other interest has come from US, European, and Asian
companies. Mr Rajeev Talwar, a senior transport ministry official, said:
'The amounts of money we need to invest are immense. But we have had an
overwhelming response from private industry.'
The projects include a letter of intent with Costain, the British
construction group, to build a Dollars 15m bridge across the Narmada river
on the west coast of India along a trunk road linking Bombay with the
fast-growing state of Gujarat. The other three schemes covered by the
letters of intent are for by-passes at Nellore, in Andhra Pradesh,
Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, and Hubli-Dharwad, in Karnataka. The Nellore
project has been awarded to HSSI, of Malaysia, and an Indian partner, and
the other two projects to SPIC, a diversified south Indian group.
Companies say negotiating contract terms could take some time since
privately operated roads and bridges are a novelty. The biggest problem will
be ensuring that rules governing toll-collection are free from future
political interference. This may prove difficult in a country where many
people have come to expect that public services, including transport, cost
little or nothing. Simply ensuring that travellers do not ignore toll booths
will be a challenge.
Also, even though Mr Jagdish Tytler, the transport minister, and his senior
officials are enthusiastic about private investment, some officials are
dragging their feet. Parliament last year authorised private investment in
roads, but the ministry has yet to publish a new highways policy
incorporating the change.
Meanwhile, the ministry is also trying to attract private investment in
ports. Private companies are working on schemes worth Dollars 300m to
install privately operated terminals, container bays, berths and storage
areas. Projects worth a further Dollars 4bn are under consideration,
including a Dollars 500m chemicals terminal in Bombay and a Dollars 600m
harbour in Goa.

FT  03 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Market to get one's teeth into - Taiwan's
Gatt quest puts betel-nuts on agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan's quest to become a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has invited demands by its trading partners that it first open its
relatively closed economy to more cars, beef, fruit, fish and, of course,
rice. No one has yet mentioned betel-nuts.
Yet Taiwan's market for this mild stimulant, chewed in many countries
throughout east and south-east Asia, is believed to be worth more than that
for rice. And as with rice, imports are banned.
Indeed, the Taiwanese appetite for betel-nut has led to environmental,
health and even criminal problems in small, crowded Taiwan as farmers across
much of the island have converted paddy fields into betel-palm groves. Of
21m Taiwanese, some 2.5m chew the nut, whose total street value is estimated
at USDollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year.
'It's much more profitable than rice, and cheap and easy to grow - no hard
work, no fertiliser,' says Mr Antonio Chiang, publisher of The Journalist,
Taiwan's leading weekly political magazine.
It was Mr Chiang who coined the now widely used appellation 'Taiwanese
chewing gum' for the much-maligned betel-nut, called binglang in Chinese,
some 10 years ago. His family grows betel-nut in their paddy fields near
Taichung in central Taiwan.
'If you drive a truck, you must chew binglang. . . the only alternative is
amphetamines,' says Mr Chiang. 'But binglang is much better, because
amphetamines are stronger and addictive.'
The market for betel-nut has grown in the last decade and now rivals rice,
which has declined in importance, as Taiwan's biggest cash crop. In 1993,
the total value of betel-nut production sold by farmers was TDollars 10.3bn
(Dollars 396m), compared with TDollars 40.5bn for rice, according to
official figures. But officials concede that those figures may be
misleading, not only because it is difficult to monitor betel plantings.
'If you take the farm price, then rice is a bigger market. But the street
value of betel-nuts is much higher than rice because of the huge mark-up,'
says Mr Tai Teh-fang, a researcher in the economics and planning department
of the agriculture ministry.
Betel-nut chewing has become increasingly popular in recent years, in part
due to rising income but also because it is seen as an emblem of ethnic
Taiwanese consciousness. Chinese who came to the island from mainland China
in 1949 as a rule do not chew.
Mr Wu Hui-lung, chief of the soil conservation division in Taiwan's
agriculture ministry, says: 'Because the price of betel-nut is getting
higher and higher, farmers are now illegally cutting down forest to grow
betel-palms. On the flat land there is no problem, but in the mountain areas
it is causing severe erosion and problems for water conservation.'
Officials say farmers could earn at least USDollars 25,000 a hectare each
year from betel-palm plantings, far more than USDollars 2,000 a hectare for
rice. 'Those betel-nut farmers are very rich,' says Mr Tai from the
agriculture ministry. 'Some of them even drive Mercedes-Benzes.'
The country's health authorities are concerned about the medical effects of
betel chewing which include a high incidence of oral cancer. The government
is also worried about gangster control of the wholesale industry, smuggling
and road-side betel-nut stands that have proliferated across the island.
Mr Wu says the ministry is studying the possibility of legalising betel-nut
imports to reduce the economic benefit to farmers in the hopes of stemming
cultivation, but no decision has yet been made. Such imports have been
banned by the ruling Nationalist government for more than four decades but
in recent years smuggling from Thailand, the Philippines and China has
become rampant.
Mr Lan Min-chuan, a trade specialist in the agriculture ministry's economics
and planning department, says that in any case Taiwan would be obliged to
open its market to imports of all agricultural products once the island
signs up to Gatt.
'The market will not be opened all at once to imports, but when it is we
will definitely impose an import duty,' he says.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US transportation department plans to sidestep the larger European
countries in its quest to open up the skies for US airlines by starting
negotiations with nine smaller European nations.
Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, said the US plans to build
on the open skies treaty already signed with the Netherlands, and hopes to
conclude agreements in the next few months.
US officials refused to say which countries would be involved in the
negotiations, but they are all smaller nations in western Europe, including
some members of the European Union. France, Germany, Italy and the UK are
not involved. Aviation experts said the list was likely to include
Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and probably Iceland,
Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg.
The US is deadlocked in aviation negotiations with the UK and France, and
the new policy appears to abandon the attempt, urged by some big US
airlines, to seek a global open skies agreement.
In May, Mr Pena said that the current system of bilateral treaties which
regulate international air transport was 'designed to limit, not to foster,
competition, and inhibits or distorts globalisation'.
But in a draft policy statement issued for comment this week, the department
said it would concentrate on open skies agreements with 'a group of
countries that share our liberalisation vision and offer important flow
traffic potential for our carriers,' while renewing efforts to achieve more
liberal agreements with larger partners such as Canada and the UK.
Mr Jeffrey Shane, a lawyer with Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering in Washington and
former head of aviation policy in the Bush administration, said the Clinton
administration had found 'some way of advancing the ball', as there appeared
to be no one ready to sit on the other side of the table for multilateral
talks.
'Notwithstanding the fact that we are talking about smaller countries, which
will not on the surface provide great access opportunities for US carriers,
by talking about a cluster of nine of them it will certainly shake things
up,' Mr Shane said.
The Netherlands agreement has already brought dividends by paving the way
for approval of a co-operation agreement between KLM, the Dutch airline, and
Northwest Airlines. Government approval of a similar arrangement between
British Airways and USAir was much more conditional.

Indonesian authorities are cracking down on government critics, labour

next week's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, according to Amnesty
International, the London-based human rights organisation. It said yesterday
the crackdown began with an anti-crime campaign in April but had been
broadened to include 'arbitrary arrest of political detainees, some of whom
had been tortured and ill-treated, the unfair trial and arbitrary
imprisonment of labour activists and the dramatic escalation in the number
of unlawful killings of alleged criminals.'

Standard Chartered Securities failed to exercise proper supervision of its

The most senior US delegation to visit Burma in six years left Rangoon
yesterday without any apparent promise of significant political reforms from
the country's military rulers. Mr Thomas Hubbard, US deputy assistant
secretary of state, said after the two-day visit that moves by the junta
towards political reconciliation would improve US-Burmese relations, but
failure to make progress 'would lead to further restrictions on our
political and economic ties'. Mr Hubbard held talks with Lt Gen Khin Nyunt,
head of military intelligence. The visit follows two meetings between Gen
Khin Nyunt and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the democracy campaigner under house
arrest in Rangoon for over five years.

At least 13 people, including the commander of the Algiers military
district, died in a shoot-out yesterday that ended a 24-hour standoff
between police and Moslem militants in the Algerian capital. The clash was
the bloodiest single gun battle in the capital during the 33-month conflict
pitting Islamic extremists against the military-backed regime. Among the
dead was Col Cherif Djelloul, shot by gunmen as he tried to negotiate the
release of hostages. The government, meanwhile, returned two fundamentalist
leaders to jail after they urged militants to continue their rebellion,
which has left more than 11,000 dead.

King Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state (left), warned tourists
yesterday to avoid his country as the bodies of three western hostages
killed by Khmer Rouge rebels were recovered, bound and shot, from graves
found near a southern rebel base. Saying Cambodia was 'clearly insecure', he
joined foreign embassies in advising tourists to avoid Cambodia. 'I condemn
with the greatest severity the contemptible and unpardonable murderers who
are responsible for the deaths of these three young gentlemen,' said the
king. Mr Serey Kosal, deputy governor of Battambang province, said the Khmer
Rouge had kidnapped 71 villagers and then executed 50 of them after a
four-day forced march to a guerrilla base.

A river of blazing oil surged through a town in southern Egypt during a
rainstorm yesterday, causing a heavy death toll - possibly more than 370. A
further 63 people died in flash flooding elsewhere in the region. According
to one report, flooding caused a bridge to fall in on pipelines at a
government oil storage depot, setting off fires and an explosion. A river of
burning fuel then rushed through the adjacent town of Durunka. Another
report said lightning started the fire at the fuel depot. Rescuers fear they
will find more victims in the charred remains of houses today.

India saw a sharp rise in foreign investment inflows in the five months to
August, the finance ministry said yesterday. It estimated the inflow reached
Dollars 2.1bn (Pounds 1.4bn), compared with Dollars 4.1bn in the financial
year 1993-94. Direct investment rose to Dollars 381m in the five months,
against Dollars 620m for 1993-94. Ministry officials said total foreign
investment in 1994-95 might surpass last year's levels. The figures do not
yet include any significant contributions from planned large-scale projects
in power generation and oil refining which could start producing investment
inflows in the next 12 months.
'The surge in foreign investment in recent times is one of the direct
manifestations of the success of the economic reforms,' the ministry said in
a mid-year review of the economy. The report paints a positive picture of
the economic outlook, saying growth in 1994-95 is likely to exceed 5 per
cent, 'much higher' than last year's 3.8 per cent. Agricultural output is
good, industrial production is recovering, inflation is being controlled and
exports continue to grow, though more slowly than last year.

Two weeks after a Hamas suicide bomber killed 22 bus passengers in the heart
of Tel Aviv, Israel and the bomber's Islamic Resistance Movement are edging
towards dialogue.
Two West Bank Hamas leaders yesterday came out in favour of talking to the
'Zionist enemy'. Sheikh Jamil Hamami said: 'Dialogue is not forbidden. There
must be a dialogue to stop the bloodshed on both sides'.
In Ramallah, Hussein Abu Kweik said: 'We would like to see such a dialogue
as soon as possible under Arab, international or Palestinian sponsorship.'
Mr Abu Kweik was one of 400 activists Israel deported to Lebanon two years
ago.
Both insisted Israel must first stop arresting Hamas members and release
those in prison, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the organisation's founder.
They were responding to signals by Israeli ministers that they were ready to
talk to 'moderate' Hamas leaders. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, told
Labour MPs: 'All Arabs would prefer Israel not to exist. Some will not come
to terms. But even in Hamas there are differences. Israel is making a
mistake when it is not ready to talk to people'.
Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said on Tuesday: 'I don't know
what we are going to speak about if there is such a contact. But all those
who tried to boycott their enemies eventually had to back off. It happened
to us with the PLO, the British with the IRA.
'Boycotting the other side because of its past, or its official view, is
wrong. It doesn't mean we have to negotiate with Hamas about the destruction
of Israel. But if there are some moderate forces in Hamas which believe
terrorism will not solve their problems and are ready to talk to us, I don't
believe we should exclude the possibility of contact with them.'
Mr Beilin took a similarly flexible stand on possible Hamas participation in
elections to the Palestinian National Authority.
'Movements or parties which see the destruction of Israel as part of their
platform should not participate.' But he saw no reason to oppose
participation by Islamic groups which wanted to challenge the PLO
leadership, so long as they accepted the legitimacy of whoever was elected.
The militant Islamic Jihad movement vowed to step up attacks against
Israelis after a Palestinian journalist was killed by a car bomb in the Gaza
Strip yesterday. The organisation blamed 'Israeli intelligence' for the
blast.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Japanese poll reform bill moves on

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The final stage in Japan's dramatic five-year campaign to purge political
corruption and weaken party factions' grip on power quietly cleared the
lower house of parliament yesterday.
The house endorsed, with most parties' assent, a bill to redraw the
boundaries of Japan's multi-seat constituencies, to create a mixed system of
UK-style single-seat districts and continental European-style proportional
representation. It brings an unobtrusive climax to the most drastic changes
to Japan's political system since the present constitution came into effect
in 1947.
After approval by the upper house around the middle of this month, all but
automatic, Japan's new electoral system will take effect in mid-December,
after a statutory one-month delay for the electorate to digest the changes.
This completes a complex package of political reforms, designed to make
governments more responsive to the electorate's aspirations and less
dependent on the special interest groups that support the so-called 'iron
triangle' of business, politics and bureaucracy.
The political sacrifices required to make progress on the plans have cost
the life of four governments since the project got off the ground in 1989,
and introduced a new element of open confrontation into the previously cosy
political consensus.
The new system will force politicians to compete harder for seats and so end
the comfortable careers of dozens of older members of parliament, who fought
against reform because their former constituencies will cease to exist.
Reform was mooted to counter public disgust at the political class,
following the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal in the late 1980s.
The main part of the reform package passed parliament in March. It consists
of four bills to establish the new electoral system, ban business donations
to individual politicians, establish a Y30.9bn (Pounds 195m) annual state
subsidy for political parties to compensate for the curb on funding, and set
new campaign rules.
Objections by the conservative Liberal Democratic party, then in opposition,
forced the government to water down the more radical original version of the
package.
After last March's agreement on the bulk of the reform package, it remained
for an independent panel to draw up the new constituencies, accepted by the
lower house yesterday. Two other final reform bills were also agreed
yesterday, to invalidate the election victories of candidates jailed for
buying votes and to set legal qualifications to become a political party.
The LDP's return to power four months ago gave it full scope to ensure that
its own softer version of political reform got through parliament.
While this guaranteed smooth passage for reform yesterday, the outcome poses
a subtle rather than radical threat to the political faction system at the
foundation of old-style Japanese politics. Some political analysts argue
that the tougher competition needed to win parliamentary seats might,
perversely, strengthen political factions' power.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Banks hit by interest rate curve ball: A look at the latest
chapter in their long struggle to survive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix Blue Wave baseball team slugged his way into
the record books this summer, becoming the first player in Japanese history
to make 210 hits in a season, he was not just propelling his club to one of
its best seasons ever. He was also setting interest rates for thousands of
customers of the leading local bank in the port city of Kobe.
As the season ended Hyogo Bank came up with a novel scheme that neatly
exploited the country's two modern obsessions - baseball and saving. It
offered customers an interest rate on five-year deposits of one-tenth of the
prolific hitter's batting percentage for the season.
Ichiro, as everyone knows him, achieved a club high batting average of 38.5
per cent, meaning he scored a hit on more than one in three attempts. So the
bank offered customers a rate of 3.85 per cent for a minimum investment of
Y100,000 (Pounds 630).
The rate was just a little above prevailing market rates of around 3.7 per
cent, and Hyogo's managers acknowledge that it was probably the enticement
of an autographed baseball as much as an extra few thousand yen a year that
brought the crowds queueing outside Hyogo's branches when the offer opened.
But the real significance of the 'Ichiro Time Savings' account was that it
opened a new chapter in the continuing saga of Japanese banks' struggle for
survival.
The bank was able to offer the special interest rate thanks to the final
stage of the liberalisation of Japanese interest rates last month. The
finance ministry removed the last controls on banks' deposits by permitting
them to open five-year deposit accounts, and to set their own interest rates
on all hitherto regulated time and demand accounts.
The effect was predictable. Hyogo's innovation was the most novel of the
banks' responses to the arrival of a new era of market economics, but the
effect was the same everywhere - a small rise in savings rates.
But while the reform was good news for customers, it spelt further problems
for the banks themselves since it could hardly have come at a worse time.
The removal of the last regulations now makes them more sensitive to
interest rates at precisely the moment when the cost of borrowing is
starting to rise.
For the last four years interest rates have been falling as Japan has
grappled with its worst recession since the second world war, but as the
economy starts to recover a period of rising interest rates will weaken
banks' profitability.
According to Mr Nozomu Kunishige, banking analyst at Kleinwort Benson in
Tokyo: 'Deregulation of deposit rates means banks' funding costs are set to
rise sharply, while their revenues are likely to remain sluggish.' Deposit
rates tend to rise more quickly than lending rates, leading to thinner
margins.
Since the end of 1993, banks' short-term prime lending rate has remained
unchanged at 3 per cent, while deposit rates have risen. The three-month
certificate of deposit rate has risen from around 2.0 to 2.3 per cent in the
same period, cutting margins by 30 per cent. Worse still, the enormous
hangover of bad debts from the collapse of the 'bubble economy', a period in
the late 1980s of rapidly rising property and other asset prices, mean banks
face limited demand for lending. That makes it difficult for them to raise
their lending rate. Indeed in the last few months, some banks have been
offering loans to blue-chip customers at rates well below prime lending
rate.
The position is even more precarious for the smaller regional banks such as
Hyogo. They draw a far higher proportion of their funds from individual
customers, where liberalisation is forcing rates even higher. Interest
income accounts for more than 80 per cent of gross business profits at such
banks. They are already heavily laden with bad debts which require
substantial provisions from profits. In the past they were at least offered
some protection by a very low cost of funds, as deposit interest rates were
fixed at low levels. Now that advantage has disappeared.
The likeliest implication, according to most analysts, is the further
fracturing of the oligopoly that has characterised Japanese banking. In the
past, banks have been notoriously hidebound by a desire to stay close to the
pack. This natural inclination was reinforced by the strict control of the
finance ministry. In the absence of competition in interest rates,
differentiation was achieved by minor distinctions in marketing approaches.
According to David Threadgold, banking analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
Tokyo, 'there is no doubt that banks' strategies are now diverging, and the
deregulation of the last few years means pricing is a key part of that'.
The strongest banks are likely to exploit their muscle; for the first time
the gap between the strongest and the weakest will take on meaningful
proportions. Though few dare say it now, that could even mean that the
Japanese banking sector may come to experience what baseball has had all
along - winners and losers.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Beijing push to mediate in Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's premier Li Peng, the most senior Chinese official to visit South
Korea since the two countries normalised ties in 1992, is promoting China's
role as diplomatic referee between North and South Korea.
He is also trying to boost Chinese exports to South Korea, which enjoys a
heavy trade surplus with Beijing, while resisting Seoul's demands for fewer
trade and investment barriers.
Mr Li agreed to a South Korean request that China, North Korea's closest and
most influential ally, should help in ensuring Pyongyang abides by its
recent agreement with the US to dismantle its nuclear programme. China has
endorsed the US-North Korean accord as a vindication of its recent policy to
promote dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang to solve the nuclear
dispute.
But the message brought by Mr Li to Seoul is that both Koreas need to make
new concessions to increase stability on the peninsula.
China expressed support for North Korean proposals to replace the armistice
that ended the 1950-53 war with a peace treaty with the US. Beijing last
week withdrew its representatives from the truce supervisory commission, to
promote this policy. But Seoul is cautious about a treaty, since it could
lead to US troops quitting South Korea.
It worries that North Korea might try to use the treaty to isolate South
Korea from its US ally, since Pyongyang insists Seoul cannot be a party to
the pact because it refused to sign the armistice in 1953. But China is
backing South Korea's call for renewed talks with North Korea, a proposal
Pyongyang has proved reluctant to accept.
China wants to stabilise the Korean peninsula, but analysts believe
Beijing's long-term goal is to maintain two separate Koreas rather than see
a united, Korea on its doorstep. 'There is nothing to rule out that China
may try to keep North Korea as a buffer state,' Mr Stephen Linton of the
Korea Studies Centre at Columbia University, says.
Potential disputes could also affect the growth of close economic ties
between China and South Korea. South Korea views China as a potentially huge
market for its products and a cheap production base, but fears China's
growing competitiveness abroad. China already sells more TV sets to the US
than Korea.
China views South Korea as a prime source of vital technology, but has
imposed trade barriers on some Korean products and restricted investments
because of the threat they pose to the development of key industries.
Several Korean car companies, including Hyundai and Daewoo, want to set up
plants in China, but Beijing has so far refused their requests.
It is demanding Korean carmakers first set up car components factories,
which would benefit the Chinese motor industry, as the price for acquiring
manufacturing facilities. Moreover, Korean factories operating in China are
mostly producing goods for export rather than the domestic market, because
of marketing curbs.
To try to persuade the Chinese to favour Korean investors, the chairmen of
the country's four biggest conglomerates, Samsung, Hyundai, Lucky-Goldstar
and Daewoo, are guiding Mr Li through their production facilities this week.
The two countries have agreed to co-operate on several industrial projects,
including aerospace, cars, high-definition television and automatic
telephone switching systems. This week, they signed a memorandum of
understanding on co-operation in nuclear power generation. South Korea hopes
that in return for providing technology, it will gain extensive market
access in China.
Samsung Electronics yesterday said it plans to invest Dollars 3bn over 20
years to build a manufacturing complex in Tianjin; Kumho, South Korea's
biggest tyre-maker, has agreed with Nanjing Tyre Factory a joint venture to
produce tyres in Jiangsu Province.
One indication the partnership may not be smooth came yesterday when the
scheduled signing of a joint-venture pact on a new commercial aircraft
project was postponed, owing to disagreements over the location of the
aircraft factory planned by Samsung Aerospace and Aviation Industries of
China. The two governments approved the joint venture on Monday.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Palestinian aid programme 'lagging': Concern grows over
impact of economic stagnation on peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank said publicly for the first time yesterday that the
international aid programme to Palestinians was more than six months behind
schedule, amid growing concerns about the potentially explosive impact of
economic stagnation on the peace process.
Mr Caio Koch-Weser, Middle East and North Africa vice-president, said that
by the end of the year donors will have disbursed only about Dollars 220m
(Pounds 137m) to the Palestinians out of a total Dollars 700m committed for
the year.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation has complained about the bottlenecks
and bureaucracy in the donor aid mechanism and warned that failure urgently
to raise living conditions in Gaza is eroding Palestinian support for peace
with Israel and fuelling an Islamic opposition.
Mr Koch-Weser conceded that, with hindsight, donors could have found faster
ways of disbursing money.
But he said: 'Success is not about disbursing money fast but doing so in a
way to have a visible and rapid improvement in the economic and social
conditions ..so that mother and child in the refugee camps can see the
change on the ground'.
Donors had over-estimated the Palestinian ability to build economic
management institutions and clearly define and streamline decision-making
processes.
It had been difficult to get adequate donor co-ordination and avoid
overburdening the embryonic Palestinian institutions with second-priority
projects.
Delays in aid disbursement reflected delays in political talks between
Israel and the PLO, also more than six months behind schedule. Donors had
assumed the still Israeli-occupied West Bank would have been transferred to
the Palestinians by last July, a move now unlikely before early next year.
The transfer of the West Bank is vital to Palestinian economic viability and
public finances owing to its considerable revenue potential.
The revenue base of the impoverished 900,000 residents of Gaza-Jericho is
insufficient to sustain creation of a central Palestinian authority and
bureaucracy and pay running costs, and the salaries for 10,800 policemen and
12,000 civil servants.
The PLO estimates it can collect a maximum Dollars 5m a month locally and a
further Dollars 6m Customs duties and income taxes levied by Israel but
transferred to the Palestinians through a clearance mechanism.
Control over the West Bank would add at least a further Dollars 20m a month
in clearance from Israel, and considerably reduce the need for donor
financing of recurrent costs of the Palestinian authority.
But Mr Koch-Weser said donors were determined not to let political delays
continue to obstruct the aid effort. 'In future one must make sure the ups
and downs of the peace negotiations don't have a major impact on the
momentum of the economic reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.'
There has been vociferous condemnation of Israel's unilateral closure of its
borders with Gaza and the West Bank two weeks ago which put 65,000
Palestinian migrant labourers out of work.
Donors say the closure, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
description of Gaza as a terrorist territory have sent worrying signals to
the aid community and potential investors.
Donors said in Casablanca there was an urgent need to revise the aid
programme and focus efforts on high-impact job creating schemes such as
public works to tackle huge unemployment and poverty.
They have also blamed the PLO for the difficulties in disbursing aid.
While most are now satisfied with transparency and accountability, they said
PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat is still refusing sufficiently to delegate
economic power and has allegedly encouraged infighting between four senior
PLO officials with overlapping responsibility for economic policy.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Mixed success for Sotheby's contemporary art sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sotheby's sale of cont - emporary works of art in New York on Tuesday night
well illustrate the current state of the world art market: buyers were
willing to pay reasonable prices for the best paintings but there was no
interest at all in the second rate, writes Antony Thorncroft.
The auction totalled Dollars 12.145m (Pounds 7.48m) but 40 per cent of the
66 lots were unsold.
One of the icons of 'Pop' art, Roy Lichtenstein's 'I ..I'm Sorry' (pictured
above), showing a comic strip blonde shedding a tear, complete with balloon
caption, sold, on estimate, for Dollars 2.47m to the Californian collector
Eli Broad.
'Pop' art has been the main casualty in the collapse of the contemporary
market since 1990 and this was a reassuring price. There was an artist
record in the Dollars 805,500 paid for Ellsworth Kelly's 'Green, Red,
Yellow, Blue', four panels of those colours. Estimates and reserves had been
kept low but judging by the results even more caution will be needed next
time.
There were encouraging signs. 'Let us now praise famous men,' a silkscreen
by Andy Warhol based on portraits of the artist Robert Rauschenberg and his
family, was fought over by seven bidders and eventually went for Dollars
1.058m, ahead of estimate, while a drawing by de Kooning, 'Monumental
Woman,' which the artist gave to the late Harold Rosenberg, art critic of
The New Yorker, on his birthday in 1954, also beat its forecast, making
Dollars 695,500.
Its provenance made it desirable, as did the eight paintings sold by the New
York publisher SI Newhouse, seven of which found buyers.
However, the failure was the most important lot, 'Untitled,' by Cy Twombly,
which was expected to make around Dollars 1m.

FT  03 NOV 94 / IMF, World Bank begin talks in Haiti this week
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A team from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will begin a
visit to Haiti at the end of this week for talks which will mark the start
of international efforts to rebuild an economy enfeebled by decades of
dictatorial rule and three years of economic sanctions.
Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's president who was reinstated last month
after three years in exile, has indicated he is willing to implement a range
of sweeping reforms to breathe life into the economy.
Mr Smarck Michel, the prime minister nominated by Mr Aristide, is also
reported to back the reforms. However, even among Mr Aristide's closest
supporters, there is a view that the changes proposed are too radical and
their unpopularity could disrupt the government's other work.
The true indication of Mr Aristide's commitment will be known by the
month-end. The letter of intent to the IMF, which should be prepared within
10 days of the visit of the joint team, will contain the economic targets to
lay the ground for wider reforms.
The mission will be led by the head of the InterAmerican Development Bank,
Mr Enrique Iglesias, and include officials from the World Bank and the UN.
The framework for the economic programme, which will not be completed in the
remaining 15 months of President Aristide's term, was agreed by a group of
donor countries and Mr Aristide's government-in-exile this year.
It proposes extensive deregulation of the economy, the divestment of state
enterprises to local and foreign investors and tariff reform. The
bureaucracy is to be trimmed and institutions, such as the judiciary and
police, rebuilt.
Of the Dollars 770m needed for the programme over the next 15 months, World
Bank officials said yesterday Dollars 80m will be required to clear arrears
to foreign creditors. This will open the door to further bilateral and
multilateral financial assistance.
Political calm should also elicit an increase in two other sources of
finance - funds for charities working in the country and remittances from
Haitians overseas.
Many Haitian businessmen believe the programme offers the best chance for
economic revival. They say assembly industries (garments, electrical
appliances, baseballs - all for the US market) will theoretically be easy to
restart if stability is maintained. But some US suppliers may be less
enthusiastic to renew contracts for the assembled products because of
concerns about longer-term political stability. Furthermore, the US
reimposed quotas recently on Haitian clothing imports.

FT  03 NOV 94 / US economy continues to expand
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All regions of the US are continuing to expand, and higher prices are
starting to work their way into the economy, the Federal Reserve said in its
'beige book' survey of economic conditions, writes George Graham in
Washington.
The beige book, which is released two weeks before each meeting of the
Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets Fed interest rate policy, said
consumer spending remained strong and labour markets are tight or tightening
in most of the country's 12 Federal Reserve districts, though only in
specific sectors.
The latest report was prepared by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and will
be used at the November 15 FOMC meeting, at which the Fed is widely expected
to raise interest rates by at least half a percentage point.
The Fed said there was little rise in retail prices, but 'pressure is
building in some districts.' The Commerce Department's index of leading
economic indicators, however, was flat in September, despite a sharp rise in
building activity that had been expected to drive the index higher. The
department said yesterday the index was unchanged at 102.2 in September,
after rising 0.5 in August, with weaker orders for consumer goods helping to
offset the jump in building permits announced last month.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that new orders for manufactured
goods decreased by 0.2 per cent in September. While orders for durable goods
increased by 0.4 per cent, non-durable orders dropped by 0.8 per cent, their
first decline for almost a year. Shipments of manufactured goods fell by 0.6
per cent in September, after rising 4.6 per cent in August: inventories
dropped 0.2 per cent.
The index of leading economic indicators is compiled from eleven statistics
and is intended to signal turning points in the economic cycle six to nine
months before they occur. The Commerce Department said six of the eleven
components pushed the index higher in September, while four pushed it lower,
with one unchanged.

FT  03 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): A year of divided
loyalties - Rarely have there been quite so many endorsements departing from
political norms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is the season of falling leaves, struggling candidacies and the frantic
search for political endorsements. Rarely, however, have there been quite so
many striking endorsements which depart from political norms. The big
questions are whether this year's batch will make a difference in key races,
the extent to which they have been dictated by local circumstances and
candidacies and, since the majority of endorsements have been of Democrats
by prominent moderate Republicans, if there is a revolt brewing against the
opposition's dominant right-wing.
Mr Ross Perot, who admits to no party allegiance, joined the parade on
Tuesday by coming out for Ms Ann Richards, the Democratic governor of Texas
whose re-election struggle against Mr George W Bush Jr, son of the former
president, is too close to call.
The immediate interpretation of the Texas billionaire's endorsement is that
it was a further manifestation of his animus for the Bush family so evident
in the 1992 presidential election and since exacerbated by some acid
comments in Mrs Barbara Bush's memoirs.
Mr Perot, whose political organisation, United We Stand, has not been a
coherent force this election year, has generally urged a vote for
Republicans in the November 8 mid-term elections and most of his supporters
are identified with conservative positions. So he will spend this weekend
campaigning in Washington state for the opponent of Mr Tom Foley, Democratic
Speaker of the House. But he has also endorsed the re-election of Mr Roy
Rohmer, the Democratic governor of Colorado.
Other endorsements to catch the eye include the Republican mayors of New
York and Los Angeles backing the Democratic candidates for governor and the
Senate respectively, though, in California, Mayor Richard Riordan also came
out for Governor Pete Wilson, the Republican incumbent.
Virginia has seen the most conspicuous variation on the theme with
Republican stalwarts from the Reagan and Bush administrations, joined by Mrs
Nancy Reagan, condemning Mr Oliver North, the Republican Senate candidate.
The conspicuous exception has been Mr James Baker, former secretary of the
treasury and state departments, who may be eyeing a presidential run of his
own in 1996.
Mr Jack Kemp and Mr Bill Bennett, cabinet secretaries under President Bush,
came out sharply against the Californian proposition that would deny social
services to illegal immigrants. This was in spite of the fact that Governor
Wilson has made support for the initiative a centrepiece of his campaign.
Opposition to hard-right candidates has also surfaced from well-known local
Republicans in Minnesota, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Iowa. But a contrary
trend is observed in some newspaper editorials, with the Washington Post and
the Los Angeles Times, both generally liberal in outlook, coming out,
respectively, for Republicans as mayor of the nation's capital and for
governor of California.
Conservative candidates have also been endorsed by powerful lobbies. The
National Rifle Association, for example, is seeking its revenge on those in
Congress who supported gun control.
The impact of endorsements has been varied. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's backing
seems to have helped turn New York Governor Mario Cuomo's campaign around.
When it came early last week, he was behind Mr George Pataki, the
Republican, but polls out in the last 24 hours put him 12-18 points ahead.
There is no polling measure yet of Mr Riordan's Sunday support for Senator
Dianne Feinstein, holding a slim lead over Congressman Michael Huffington,
but it certainly cannot harm her in southern California, where she is
weakest. Governor Wilson now holds a solid lead over Ms Kathleen Brown, even
though support for the anti-immigrant proposition, still likely to pass, has
been falling.
Both mayors argued the toss that Mr Huffington and Mr Pataki, if elected,
could not be relied on to help their cities. Mr Giuliani was also motivated
by dislike of Senator Al D'Amato, the New York Republican who is Mr Pataki's
patron.
A Texas poll yesterday gave Governor Richards a small three-point lead over
Mr Bush, but it was taken before Mr Perot's endorsement. In Virginia,
diehard supporters of Mr North, in a virtual dead heat with Senator Charles
Robb, seem impervious to advice from Republican grandees. In Michigan,
Governor John Engler is on a cakewalk to re-election.
In Washington, DC, few think the Post's endorsement of Mrs Carol Schwartz
can prevent the return to city hall of Mr Marion Barry, a prospect which so
horrifies residents of the city's only predominantly white ward that a
semi-serious movement has been launched to secede to Maryland.
More broadly, Democrats have taken some heart from Republican ideological
divisions, with President Bill Clinton himself doing his best this week to
play them up in the company of Democratic candidates who once spurned him.
But, mostly, it is the Democrats who are on the defensive and the
Republicans who are more likely to vote.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Dutch telecoms group plans to cut 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch telecommunications and postal group, KPN, said yesterday it would
cut 3,000 jobs over the next three years in its telecommunications business.
It is the first round of job losses since the company was partially floated
on the Amsterdam stock exchange in June.
PTT Telecom, KPN's telecommunications arm, said the job losses, representing
nearly 10 per cent of its workforce of 31,981 people, were necessary to
boost productivity.
It hopes to be able to shed most of the jobs through natural attrition,
avoiding the need for large and potentially controversial forced
redundancies.
'Increasing productivity is necessary if the company wants to continue
delivering high-quality services at low prices in a fully deregulated
telecommunications market,' PTT Telecom said.
The job loses should boost productivity, measured by the number of telephone
lines per employee, by 15 to 20 per cent by the end of 1997. By pursuing
this goal, PTT Telecom said it wanted to emulate the 'Baby Bell' telephone
companies in the US, which have achieved an average 6 per cent annual
improvement in productivity over the past few years.
The telecommunications subsidiary said the job losses were a continuation of
restructuring begun in 1990.
PTT Post, KPN's postal company, has cut around 6,000 jobs since 1990 and now
employs around 38,411 people. KPN is the Netherlands' largest private sector
company.
The job losses in telecommunications will come across the board but will
concentrate specifically on employees in telecommunications maintenance.
Digitalisation of the Dutch telecommunications network means that fewer
people are needed for maintenance work.
However, PTT Telecom said it expects to hire additional employees in future
in 'customer-contact' jobs such as sales and marketing, as well as in mobile
communications and new media.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Belgium to relax pension fund rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Belgian government is preparing to relax investment rules for pension
schemes, dropping the requirement that at least 15 per cent of assets be
invested in government bonds.
The proposals are part of a wider set of reforms of Belgian pension law
which will also address issues such as the way liabilities are calculated.
The move comes just as other European governments debate just how much
freedom ought to be allowed to pension fund managers responsible for
investing assets. A proposed EU directive intended to bar member states from
unduly restricting investments in equities or in non-domestic securities was
withdrawn because agreement could not be reached.
Belgium, which has roughly BFr250bn (Pounds 4.9bn) in occupational scheme
assets, already has few restrictions on how assets can be invested.
The Belgian Association of Pension Funds expects the 15 per cent rule to be
scrapped in the next few months, with legislation drawn up soon. It has
campaigned for the move. 'On pensions we are closer to the UK position, than
the French or the Italian,' said a representative.
Mr Paul de Smet, partner at consulting actuaries Conac, said that as a
practical matter, the new rule will have little immediate effect on bond
holdings.
According to the association, 34.8 per cent of a typical Belgian fund was
invested in Belgian government bonds at the end of last year.
The next biggest component was foreign equities (21.7 per cent), followed by
Belgian equities (16.5 per cent). Foreign bonds accounted for only 12.6 per
cent of investments, while cash accounted for 7.6 per cent of the average
portfolio.
But the shares change according to the company. Funds of the big
multinationals based in Belgium - for example IBM and Unilever - diversify
more, with a tendency to invest more in foreign equities.
However, while providing some liberalisation on investments, the proposed
legislation will make it much harder for employers to borrow the surplus
assets of their pension scheme themselves. The rules which set investment
restrictions cover only the assets which are specifically needed to
calculate liabilities, Mr de Smet said.
There are no restrictions on how the surplus assets are invested and some
companies have lent the funds back to themselves.

FT  03 NOV 94 / German coalition talks make steady progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three political parties negotiating a new coalition government under
Chancellor Helmut Kohl have agreed in principle to introduce wide-ranging
environmental and education reforms during the next legislative period,
their spokesman said yesterday.
However, despite broad agreement on these issues, which dominated
yesterday's discussions, and a general willingness to try to end the talks
by tomorrow, all three parties face difficulties on three outstanding
issues: internal security, foreign policy and the future of the 'solidarity'
income tax to help curb the budget deficit.
Mr Werner Hoyer, general secretary of the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior
partner in the coalition, said the next government would introduce a tax on
CO gases, but only provided countries within the European Union did
likewise.
'We cannot go it alone,' an FDP official said.
At the same time, as a means of reducing energy consumption, the FDP, the
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU), its
Bavarian sister party, said they would also try to encourage the production
of cars with much lower fuel consumption.
On education, Mr Peter Hinze, general secretary of the CDU, said reforms
would be introduced with the aim of reducing the amount of time spent by
students in the universities, while the quality of teaching and the
structure of higher education would have to become more cost-effective and
competitive.
Mr Hinze conceded that some of the east German states had already introduced
education reforms which also include cutting back the number of years for
secondary school students.
The coalition talks have gone better than expected, with few important
disagreements.
However, FDP officials admitted they expected some tough bargaining today
when foreign policy and internal security were discussed.
At issue is how far the FDP is willing to compromise its libertarian
principles on combating crime. The CDU and the CSU want to give the police
more powers to use electronic surveillance of private individuals.
An attempt was made during the last legislative period to tighten internal
security, but the FDP opposed any extension of bugging powers.
The FDP will also try to push for granting dual citizenship for foreigners
living in Germany, who already make up nearly 6 per cent of the population.
But if they fail on this, as is expected since the CSU has traditionally
adopted a tough stance, the FDP will try to make access to citizenship
easier.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Italians protest against state TV changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A chorus of protest has greeted the reorganisation of the editorial
management of the RAI, Italy's state broadcasting organisation, carried out
by the appointees of the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
A group of prominent intellectuals and broadcasters have petitioned
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to intervene over what they claim are curbs
on the freedom of expression.
The opposition, headed by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), has protested that the government has tightened its hold on
information; and unions working at the RAI have threatened to take court
action against the management.
One of the new board members, Mr Alfio Marchini, personally endorsed by the
speaker of the chamber of deputies in the Italian parliament, has also
resigned in protest.
The reorganisation, completed on Tuesday, came almost 45 days after the
first editorial changes were introduced and involved the removal of some
personnel only recently appointed.
Government supporters have justified the appointments and the overt
political interference on the grounds that the RAI has always been
politically controlled. The appointments involve programme controllers and
channel director generals for the RAI's three TV channels.
The populist Northern League, usually an opponent of its coalition
colleagues on media matters, has been noticeably silent over the past 24
hours, not least because some of its appointees have gained a foothold and
the third television channel will have a federal/regional framework.
The complaints follow three main lines. The first is that the right-wing
coalition government has deliberately placed its own sympathisers in the key
positions, regardless of individual professional qualifications. The
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance has done well in securing a substantial
foothold; but at the same time a number of persons once identified with
Socialist leader Bettino Craxi and recycled as Forza Italia are back in
power.
A second line of complaint is that the financially troubled RAI risks being
seriously weakened by the changes so aiding the competition - the three
television channels of prime minister Berlusconi's Fininvest. This in turn
raises the running sore of Mr Berlusconi's conflict of interest.
The third issue concerns the absence of any independent control over
state-run television. The management board is headed by Mrs Letizia Moratti,
a prominent stockbroker brought in by the government. The board in turn is
monitored by the parliamentary media committee that is dominated by the
governing coalition.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Swedish fiscal package targets debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's Social Democratic government yesterday promised new measures to
stabilise the country's fast-growing debt, saying the moves would reduce the
country's budget deficit and bring down interest rates.
In a fiscal package announced yesterday, the government included SKr31.6bn
(Pounds 2.7bn) in tax increases and SKr25.5bn in spending cuts, SKr6bn more
than the SKr51bn 'budget strengthening' total outlined by the party in the
run-up to the September election which brought it to power.
A further SKr20bn of unspecified new measures, mainly spending cuts, will be
presented in Sweden's January budget. Mr Goran Persson, the finance
minister, said the proposals should be sufficient to enable Sweden to
stabilise central government debt by 1998 or even earlier.
But the markets took a more sceptical view and some commentators suggested
further savings would be needed. Bond yields rose a few basis points.
The package was denounced by Mr Carl Bildt, leader of the opposition
Moderate party, who called it 'the biggest tax increase in Swedish modern
history' and a return to the 'failed' Social Democratic policies of the
past.
The Federation of Swedish Industries regretted the emphasis on tax increases
and the delay in implementing badly needed savings. The size of Sweden's
budget deficit, projected at 13 per cent of gross domestic product in the
current financial year, and the growth in state debt are the main symptoms
of the country's financial crisis. The difficulties have led Moody's, the US
rating agency, to consider downgrading Sweden's debt rating.
The minority Social Democratic government hopes to get the SKr57.1bn package
through parliament with the support of the former communist Left party.
The government forecast GDP growth of 2.5 per cent in 1994, rising to 3.4
per cent next year. This is a more optimistic view of the outlook than most
independent commentators have taken. Inflation is forecast at 3.0 per cent
next year while unemployment, excluding those on training schemes, is
expected to fall to 6.9 per cent from 8.0 per cent in 1994.
Mr Lars Heikensten, chief economist at Svenska Handelsbanken, said the
government could not have risked more drastic measures yesterday in the
run-up to Sweden's referendum on EU membership on November 13. But he
believed the government was 'taking a risk' by not proposing tougher
measures in January.
Mr Persson urged Swedes to vote Yes to EU membership, warning that the
economic costs of staying outside were greater than those of joining.
Membership would cost Sweden around SKr20bn a year, but he said this would
largely be funded by the groups which would most benefit from membership.

French unemployment levels for September jumped to a record high of 3.35m,
12.7 per cent of the labour force, according to government statistics
released yesterday.
The figures were disappointing news for the conservative government of the
prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, whose undeclared presidential ambitions
rest on his ability to prove he can bring down unemployment, the main
concern of French voters.
However, economists noted that the poor figures disguised an improving
underlying trend, and said there was no question but that unemployment would
be on an overall downward path in the run-up to next April's presidential
election.
The government did its best to play down the significance of the rise,
although some commentators expressed concern at the high rate at a time of
economic recovery within the country.
The seasonally-adjusted number of people seeking work rose by 13,900 people
or 0.4 per cent to 3,351,900 during the month, following an increase of 0.5
per cent in the August.
Mr Michel Graud, the minister of labour, said the increase reflected a
number of people joining the workforce for the first time who were inspired
to apply for jobs because they perceived the economy to be recovering.
He said that much of the rise was because of women entering the workforce.
Mr Giraud said the government was sticking to its forecast that unemployment
would stabilise at the end of the 1994 and fall in 1995, a view that
economists said they still believed.
However, the rise was criticised in the French parliament by Mr Martin
Malvy, the leader of the socialist group, who said it showed 'the bankruptcy
of the solutions put in place by the government'.
Mr Malvy said the jobless figures cast doubt on Mr Balladur's ability to
deliver on a target of cutting 1m from the jobless roll in the next few
years and 200,000 in 1995 alone. 'How can one, in these conditions have the
slightest faith in the promises of Mr Balladur as a candidate (for
president),' he said.
Reactions to the figures from analysts were mixed yesterday. Mr Gwinn
Hacche, a European economist for James Capel, said: 'This is a bit
disappointing. We had expected unemployment to remain unchanged but this is
a new record.'
He said it was surprising to see the increase at a time when there was
strong economic recovery in France above the levels in much of the rest of
Europe, and reflected an underlying high level of structural unemployment in
the country.
Mr Hacche said there was a 'worrying trend' of structural unemployment
'ratcheting up' after each recession in France, aided by a minimum wage and
a generous social security system.
'The government must be finding it increasingly difficult to find new
schemes especially for the young unemployed,' he said. 'The budget deficit
means they cannot embark on general reflation and it may favour Mr Jacques
Chirac who has called for more domestic action to tackle joblessness.'
However, Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, said: 'It
looks like things are going the government's way.
'The trend is really improving. We are seeing a stabilisation rather than
any dramatic increase. What influences consumer confidence is the rate of
change, not the absolute numbers.'

FT  03 NOV 94 / Anglo-German panel questions EU regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A panel of British and German businessmen yesterday took aim at European
Union employment rules in a joint drive to eliminate unnecessary Brussels
regulations.
A 10-man Anglo-German deregulation group, set up by the London and Bonn
governments, drew up a 'substantive list' of Brussels measures seen as
unhelpful to business, according to Mr Francis Maude, who led the UK
delegation.
Mr Maude, a former financial secretary to the UK Treasury, who now works for
the US bank Morgan Stanley, said the businessmen on the panel agreed that
proposed new EU employment legislation was 'immensely damaging'.
This view was backed by Mr Johann Eekhoff, state secretary at the Bonn
economics ministry, who led the German delegation. He said proposed Brussels
rules on working-time and part-time working were 'not flexible enough.'
The panel, which examined measures affecting in particular the chemicals,
transport and food production sectors, will send its findings to the two
governments, which will then pass them on to Brussels.
The UK businessmen included representatives from the Asda supermarket group
and brewers Youngers, while the German side fielded senior figures from
chemicals company BASF and car group Mercedes-Benz.
Mr Eekhoff said there was particular concern that undue Brussels bureaucracy
could spur European companies to transfer activities outside the EU.
Along with planned Brussels rules on working-time and part-time working  -
neither of which have yet passed into law - Mr Maude said the panel also
criticised proposed tightening of legislation on transport of hazardous
substances.
Mr Eekhoff - whose ministry is traditionally the most active proponent of
free-market ideas in the Bonn government - congratulated Britain on being
'more successful than we are on deregulation and privatisation.'
This was music to the ears of Mr Maude, who deregulated himself in 1992  -
after losing his parliamentary seat - and now is in charge of international
privatisation operations at Morgan Stanley.

The director of the Czech Republic's coupon privatisation programme has been
arrested and charged with taking a bribe to manipulate a stock tender.
Mr Jaroslav Lizner's arrest has reopened allegations of high-level
corruption in the Czech Republic's privatisation programme, which has seen
billions of dollars of state assets sold to private investors.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, yesterday described Mr Lizner's
arrest as 'a bolt from the blue' but denied that it would harm the
privatisation programme, which is due to be completed early next year.
Police arrested Mr Lizner after he accepted Kc8.33m (Pounds 188,000) to
ensure the awarding of stock under the country's vouchers-for-shares scheme,
a government spokesman said.
Mr Lizner heads the Centre for Coupon Privatisation (CKP), which administers
the programme that grants shares in privatised companies to citizens in
exchange for government vouchers given for a nominal fee.
Finance minister Mr Ivan Kocarnik said his deputy, Mr Vladimir Rudlovcak,
would take over the directorate of the CKP until the graft case against Mr
Lizner was resolved.
Mr Kocarnik said Mr Rudlovcak would immediately take over the post and that
the current wave of privatisations would proceed as planned.
Mr Lizner is also the director of the Central Securities Registry (SCP), the
central clearing house where all bond and share transactions in the Czech
Republic must be registered.
Police, acting on a tip, observed Mr Lizner as he met three people outside a
Prague restaurant late on Monday, a government spokesman said. All four were
apprehended after Mr Lizner accepted the money packed in a briefcase.
Mr Lizner was charged with corruption and 'serious criminal economic
activity'.
The three other people involved were later released.
The coupon programme has proved highly successful and has been held up as an
example to other former communist countries trying to build a market
economy, but allegations of corruption and favouritism have abounded.
Mr Klaus has repeatedly dismissed any pitfalls in the privatisation system
he helped design, saying that speed was more important than accuracy.
Mr Klaus told a news conference yesterday the Lizner incident was 'lightning
from a clear sky' and would not affect the future of the programme, which is
due to release a wave of shares early next year.
'In view of its relationship to the continuation of coupon privatisation,
this has nothing in common,' he said.
The scheme is currently concluding its second wave by privatising 861
companies, after exchanging shares in nearly 1,000 companies in the first
wave, which ended in 1992.

Norway's economy will expand more slowly next year, according to Mr Torstein
Moland, central bank governor. He told a seminar in London yesterday that
gross domestic product growth next year should fall to 2.5-3 per cent, as
consumption became more subdued. The rise in consumer prices was down to 0.9
per cent in April but has since risen to 1.7 per cent, reflecting higher
excise duties introduced in July. Mr Moland said that if wage inflation
could be limited to 3 per cent this year and next, overall inflation would
remain at 2 per cent in 1995. Traditional exports, excluding oil and
shipping, had risen in value terms by 12 per cent this year, Mr Moland said.
The improvement in the economy had reduced Norway's vulnerability to oil
price fluctuations and the current account would remain in balance next
year.

<TEXT>
Between a quarter and a third of east Germany's labour force will be without
permanent work by 2010 unless productivity and competitiveness improve
sharply. The east German economy will have to become much more
export-oriented to create new jobs, concludes a joint study by the Halle
Institute for Research and the Hamburg-based Korber Foundation. The study
contradicts more optimistic forecasts released last week by the six economic
institutes which advise the federal government. These showed that
unemployment in east Germany had fallen to about 15 per cent of the
6.6m-strong labour force and should stabilise at that level. However, the
Halle-Korber study says this figure could rise if the privatised sector in
particular is not supported by more risk capital. The report says
productivity is still only 40 per cent of west German levels.

<TEXT>
Iberia, Spain's financially crippled state airline, has been forced to
ground most of its flights today as unions stage the first of two 24-hour
strikes this month. The unions are objecting to the company's refusal to
make up back pay that was due at the end of October and to its plans to
reduce salaries by an average of 15 per cent over the next two years. The
airline cancelled all its international flights serving routes that are
covered by other airlines, as well as 70 per cent of its domestic flights.
Iberia is on course to lose Pta44bn (Pounds 216m) this year. The industrial
dispute could delay its efforts to gain European Union authorisation for
fresh public funding of at least Pta125bn. Unions say Pta200bn will be
required to assure future viability. A second strike is planned on November
11.

Germany's federal cartel office yesterday recommended that two of the
country's largest holiday agencies be prevented from having the exclusive
right to block book rooms in 15 Spanish hotels because it hinders
competition. Touristic Union International (TUI) and NUR Touristic said they
would fight the decision. The cartel office's recommendations follow
complaints by other German travel agencies that TUI and NUR had stifled
competition in the Canary and Balearic Islands last year by block-booking
hotel beds for almost the entire season. Alltours, a German-based agency,
said it had been impossible to reserve rooms even in other hotels because of
the prices offered by TUI and NUR, which they claimed were beyond what it
could offer. The cartel office recommendation coincides with a surge of
renewed German interest in Spain, and in the islands particularly. This is
because tens of thousands of holiday-makers switched their vacations from
Turkey after attacks on Germans in the region.

Bosnian Serbs facing a joint Moslem-Croat assault have enlisted the help of
rebel Serb guns in neighbouring Croatia to fight a offensive by the Bosnian
government army, United Nations officers said yesterday. Croatian Serbs were
reported to have mobilised 2,000 troops and to have massed men and weaponry
along the border, although there was no evidence that they had crossed it.
Intense fighting was reported in the suburbs of Serb-held Bosanska Krupa in
northwest Bosnia, but Serb fighters were holding off the attack.
The Bosnian government troops' advance out of the Bihac northwestern enclave
has slowed after a week-long offensive that pushed Serb soldiers from almost
100 square miles of conquered territory. UN observers were barred from most
of the battle zone, and each side was claiming the upper hand.
According to a UN officer, Bosnian Serbs also faced fresh attacks near
Sarajevo and Bosnian Croat forces joined the Moslem offensive in central
Bosnia in a joint action on the Serb-held town of Kupres. Significant Croat
troop movements were reported in the area.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Baltic neighbours feel chill from east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chill in Polish-Russian relations symbolised by the last-minute
postponement of prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin's official visit to
Warsaw this week may be part of a new hardening in Moscow's relations with
with its Baltic neighbours.
In London yesterday the Lithuanian prime minister, Mr Adolfas Slezevicius,
said that his country is facing unexpected difficulties in its negotiations
with Russia over a military transit agreement.
A law regulating the movement of Russian troops and equipment through
Lithuania, en route to and from the Russian Baltic province of Kaliningrad,
was due to come into force in September. But Russian negotiators have
objected to the troop transit rules being incorporated into a general law
which also regulates the transport of hazardous materials across Lithuania.
This Baltic state sandwiched between Poland and Belarus is on the most
direct route from Russia to Kaliningrad.
Moscow, meanwhile, is seeking an alternative transit route to its isolated
province which would avoid the Baltic states entirely and go through Belarus
and north-eastern Poland. This was to have been one of the subjects for
discussion at the aborted Polish-Russian summit meeting.
Kaliningrad, the former German port city of Konigsburg, and the surrounding
province, was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of the war. Moscow has
retained control, using it as a staging post for the repatriation of troops
and equipment from former east Germany and Poland. Some 100,000 Russian
troops are believed to be in the enclave. Lithuania, together with other
Baltic basin states, is hoping to persuade Moscow to demilitarise both port
and province over time.
Mr Slezevicius, a former minister under the Soviet-era government, and whose
Democratic Labour party heavily defeated the nationalists led by Mr
Vyatautis Landsbergis in the 1992 elections, was in the UK to encourage
greater trade and investment.
A priority project is construction of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) oil
pipeline from the port of Klaipeda to the refinery at Mazeikia to reduce
dependence on Russian oil. Lithuania is also seeking Dollars 150m to
modernise the refinery whose 12m tonnes a year capacity is currently less
than half used. Shell has just completed the first of a string of planned
petrol service stations.
Last month the IMF approved a Dollars 201m standby agreement loan in support
of economic reforms which have led to rapid privatisation and a resumption
of economic growth. In April Lithuania pegged the Litas, its internally
convertible currency, to the US dollar. Inflation is expected to fall to 40
per cent this year from 189 per cent in 1993 and gross domestic product is
expected to rise by 1.5 per cent in 1994 and by up to 6 per cent next year.

West German industrial production gathered pace again in September after
falling during August, according to provisional data from the economics
ministry. Although preliminary calculations showed output fell a seasonally
adjusted 0.2 per cent during the month, after a revised 2.6 per cent
month-on-month drop in August, the ministry said it expected the latest
figures to be revised upwards by 'a good two percentage points'. This
implied production increased by more than 3 per cent in comparison with
September last year, according to independent analysts. James Capel in
London said gross domestic product in the region appeared to have grown only
0.6 per cent in the third quarter after 1 per cent in the second. However,
other data on business confidence and economic developments in export
markets elsewhere in Europe suggested the apparent weakening was merely a
lull within a strong underlying growth trend.
The Greek unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in September against 6.7 per
cent the previous month and 5.9 per cent a year earlier. Romania's trade
surplus fell to Dollars 75.9m in September from Dollars 92.6m in August.
Unemployment rose to 10.8 per cent.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Poles read Russian anti-Nato signals: How Warsaw sees the
postponement of Chernomyrdin's visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last-minute postponement of a long delayed visit to Warsaw by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian premier, has been interpreted in Warsaw as
confirmation that a Russian effort has begun to block new US initiatives on
Nato membership for Poland.
Tuesday's decision, ostensibly caused by the Polish government's failure to
make amends for a recent incident when police at a Warsaw railway station
beat several Russian travellers, was sudden and unexpected. Teams of experts
had been in Warsaw all week preparing for the two-day visit.
Mr Yuri Kashlev, the Russian ambassador, stressed in a newspaper interview
yesterday the depth of Russian opposition to any expansion of Nato to the
east. 'In our view, having the central European countries join Nato is not a
rational option,' he said. 'We think such a development would reduce our own
security.'
Mr Chernomyrdin was to have signed agreements on a new gas pipeline across
Poland as well as a mutual write-down of Comecon-era debts. The latter
covered the Dollars 2bn and 4bn transferable roubles owed by Poland and the
Dollars 330m and TRbs75bn Russian debt to Poland. The debt deal is seen as a
way of wiping the slate clean of past problems and paving the way for future
trade growth.
Polish sales to Russia rose by 68 per cent to Dollars 623m over the first
eight months of this year but remain a mere 6 per cent of its total exports.
In the communist era the Soviet Union took more than a third of Polish
exports. Similarly, Polish imports, at Dollars 850m, rose by 40 per cent
above last year's levels but still account for only 6.5 per cent of total
imports.
After this year's trade growth, Russia's share in Polish trade turnover has
returned to 1992 levels, but that was when the slump in mutual trade was
already well established.
In spite of the postponement, Mr Chernomyrdin is believed to have been keen
for the visit to go ahead. He recently made the highly symbolic gesture of
travelling to Katyn near Smolensk, burial site of thousands of Polish
officers murdered by the NKVD, forerunner of the KGB, on Stalin's orders in
1940. He intervened to end opposition by local officials to Polish efforts
to construct a cemetery for the murdered officers. The gesture showed that
Mr Chernomyrdin, like President Boris Yeltsin, is keen for the two countries
to put their troubled past behind them.
Russia needs a friendly Poland for strategic reasons. Routing the planned
gas pipeline across Belarus and Poland to Germany, for example, would avoid
Ukraine, which has in the past threatened to block Russian gas sales to the
west.
The pipeline, whose Polish section will cost Dollars 2.5bn, will raise
annual sales of Russian gas in Poland to 14bn cubic metres. Mr
Chernomyrdin's visit was needed to sign a protocol confirming the commitment
as well as to clarify financing arrangements.
The Russian ambassador also confirmed in his interview that Russia wants
Warsaw to open a new crossing point on the Polish-Belarus border which would
enable Russians to travel to and from their Kaliningrad enclave without
going through the Baltic states.
Yesterday, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, said there
could be no question of apologising for the incident at the railway station
until the case had been thoroughly investigated. But the government is
expected to come under pressure to conciliate Russia from local businessmen
keen to see an expansion in bilateral trade.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Moscow stance on Bosnia worries Nato

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nato is worried by Russia's cool reaction to its tough new procedures for
carrying out air raids in Bosnia, according to western diplomats. Moscow's
position is one of several factors that could cloud the prospects for
further joint action by the contact group on Bosnia, which consists of the
US, Britain, Russia, France and Germany.
Diplomats said Russian diplomats in Brussels had been briefed on the new air
strikes policy as soon as it had been formally endorsed by Nato ambassadors
last Friday.
Nato officials had tried to assure their Russian counterpart that the policy
did not take away the 'dual key' system under which any bombing raids in
Bosnia have to be approved by the United Nations as well as Nato.
However, subsequent Russian comments - suggesting that Nato was grabbing
more power for itself - indicated that these assurances were not accepted.
Apart from the air strikes policy, strains in the contact group have been
highlighted by its members' contrasting reactions to the recent offensive by
the Moslem-led Bosnian army. The offensive has been endorsed in Washington
and criticised in Moscow, while British officials have pointedly avoided
commenting either way.
Bosnian Serb forces claimed yesterday to have halted the government's
offensive south of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia. UN officials reported
intensifying exchanges of mortar, machinegun and artillery fire around
Bihac, which is supposed to be a UN-protected safe area.
On Tuesday night, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the
Moslems would be 'trounced militarily'. He blamed Belgrade for the biggest
Serb setbacks since the start of the fighting 31 months ago.
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed an embargo against Bosnian
Serbs three months ago, and he is also trying to prod rebel Serbs from
neighbouring Croatia into making a deal with Zagreb.
Mr Karadzic said the losses were 'largely the consequence of the. . .
blockade'. Sources close to the Bosnian Serb leadership yesterday said the
defeats were the 'result of treasonable conduct by some Bosnian Serb
officers dictated from Belgrade'.
It was unclear whether Mr Karadzic's warning of a 'fifth column' was aimed
at high-ranking Bosnian Serb officers who, despite the embargo, still
receive their pay from the Yugoslav army. He said that 'anyone who spread
rumours or lies about a Serbian sell-out would be shot'.
South of Sarajevo, Bosnian Croats and Moslems co-ordinated an attack on the
strategic plateau round Kupres, known as the 'door to Bosnia'. The Bosnian
Croat entrance into the war casts a pall over peace talks set to resume
today between Zagreb and rebel Serbs from Croatia.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Grachev'sjob at risk after sacking

The future of General Pavel Grachev, Russia's defence minister, was in
question yesterday following the sacking on Tuesday of his deputy, Gen
Matvei Burlakov. His deputy was removed after allegations of corruption in
the Western group of armed forces which he had commanded until September.
Mr Sergei Yushenkov, head of the state duma (lower house) defence committee,
said 'the next logical step should be the resignation of Grachev. This would
accord with the officer's code of dignity and would help the moral cleansing
of the army'.
President Boris Yeltsin's decision to fire Gen Burlakov 'shows civilian
control over the army exists and that the president is listening to press
and public opinion'.
Mr Yushenkov's remarks were underscored by Gen Alexander Lebed, commander of
the Russian 14th army in the Moldovan province of Trans Dnestr and the most
popular figure in the forces - according to polls taken of officers.
He told the Itar-Tass news agency that he welcomed Gen Burlakov's dismissal
and said that the sooner the army was cleansed of corruption 'the stronger
the army and the stronger the Russian state will be'.
The army's top command is clearly in turmoil. Gen Grachev, appointed after
playing a key role in foiling the attempted putsch in 1991, has been close
to Mr Yeltsin and may still have enough influence to survive. Ms Elena
Agapova, an aide, said last night that the decree removing Gen Burlakov
'came as no surprise. . . . Gen Burlakov has repeatedly requested the
defence minister to relieve him of his duties'.
Mr Yuri Yerin, former military prosecutor for the Western group, said
yesterday that Gen Grachev had been cleared of any corruption by 'numerous'
commissions and inquiries. The purchase with extra-budgetary funds of two
Mercedes cars for his use was 'not improper'.
However, Gen Grachev is not, and never has been, the defence establishment's
favoured candidate for minister - and his alleged acquiescence in corruption
is a serious weakness.
Communist and nationalist politicians have long demanded his resignation
because he ordered his tank units to fire on the Russian parliament last
October in obedience to Mr Yeltsin's requests. Now the reformist parties
have deserted him following the murder of a young journalist three weeks ago
who was investigating corruption in the Western group.
Though popular, Gen Lebed is regarded by the top brass as too young and
inexperienced to take the top job.
Mr Yushenkov named as possible candidates the army chief of staff, General
Mikhail Kolesnikov, the former Soviet defence minister, Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov, and Gen Andrei Nikolayev, chief of the border guards - which
are not under Gen Grachev's control.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Russian cabinet shake-up looms: Changes in economics and
justice portfolios under discussion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A shake-up in the Russian cabinet was on the cards last night. Mr Ivan
Rybkin, chairman of the state duma (lower house), said following a meeting
with President Boris Yeltsin that a reshuffle would take place within one or
two weeks.
A spokesman for Mr Rybkin said after the meeting that the posts discussed
included those of the economics and justice minister and 'a range of changes
among the deputy prime ministers'. The economics portfolio is held by Mr
Alexander Shokhin, a reformer who is now thought to be vulnerable but may
retain his parallel post as deputy prime minister.
The Itar-Tass news agency said the discussion took place in the context of a
state duma vote of no-confidence in the government which failed by only 30
votes. Only 54 deputies from 450 actively voted for the government.
It also comes after a Moscow by-election last weekend which was won by the
candidate backed by the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party, and
local elections in St Petersburg which saw a strong showing for the
communists.
Neither the nationalist nor the communist parties have any representative in
the cabinet.
The discussion between the duma chairman and Mr Yeltsin came after details
emerged of the report on 'black Tuesday' by the Security Council commission,
which is staffed wholly by military and security chiefs. On that day,
October 11, the rouble plunged to Rbs4,000 to the dollar. It later recovered
to around Rbs2,800 but has since declined again, if gently, to Rbs3,093.
According to the presidential press service, the report accused a number of
senior public servants of 'ill-timed, if not incompetent, decisions' and
said that there was 'insufficient co-ordination between the federal bodies
of the executive branch'. It ordered the government to take immediate
control of the currency exchange rate and 'consolidate the legal backbone of
the financial, including the currency, market'.
The Interfax news agency, quoting 'well-informed sources', said that the
Council's report named the economics and finance ministries, the central
bank and several commercial banks as having 'profited directly and
considerably from destabilising the national financial system'.
The acting finance minister and the governor of the central bank both
resigned after the collapse of the currency last month.
The report says, according to Interfax's sources, that the collapse will
'entail long term and deep negative consequences for the Russian economy'
because foreign investors 'now doubt the expediency of investing in Russia'.
It recommended continuing investigation and, if necessary, criminal
proceedings.
Mr Rybkin, an increasingly authoritative figure, said that the sackings of
the central bank governor and finance minister would be followed by
'bringing to book some of their deputies'. On Mr Shokhin's fate, he
commented ominously that 'it will be decided by the government'.
In discussions on the passage of the budget through the parliament, Mr
Rybkin said that Mr Yeltsin had described as 'unconstitutional' the legal
provision under which the government had to resign if the budget fell, and
had called for the Constitutional Court, now being recreated after a year's
non-existence, to look into the issue. The discussion appears to point to
fears that the budget will not pass.
Rumours abound about who would replace Mr Shokhin, but none point to his
successor being a reformist figure. Since his removal would come following a
report drawn up by representatives of the security services and the
military, it is widely assumed that a more conservative figure would emerge
 -with others of the same stripe possibly also taking their place in the
cabinet.
The discussion was remarkable for the absence of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin who,
as prime minister, would be expected to command a cabinet apparently chosen
by the president and the duma chairman.

FT  03 NOV 94 / US candidates chase votes on digital superhighway

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Political candidates in California have discovered that the information
superhighway can be a fast and inexpensive route to voters. They are using
the Internet, a global network of computers, to answer questions and deliver
election campaign pitches in the run-up to next week's US mid-term
elections.
Fed up with television campaign ads filled with more barbs than substance,
thousands of computer users are going online to find out where the
candidates stand on issues and to research details of their past records.
Over the past month, more than 5,000 people have logged on to the California
Online Voter Guide, a non-partisan service funded by groups ranging from the
California Teachers' Association to Pacific Bell, the regional telephone
company.
Many more are accessing Project Vote Smart, a service sponsored by the
League of Women Voters that provides voting records, campaign finance data
and performance evaluations of candidates by interest groups.
Several candidates are using electronic mail to communicate directly with
voters. E-mail addresses for the two main gubernatorial candidates in
California - incumbent Pete Wilson (Republican) and his challenger Kathleen
Brown (Democrat) - have been widely published and their campaign staff
regularly answer voters' questions.
Both have also participated in online chat sessions with subscribers to
America On-line, CompuServe and Prodigy, the commercial online services.
Ms Brown also has an electronic presence on the World Wide Web, the fastest
growing portion of the Internet which provides easy ways to scan the globe
for information resources.
To reach voters who do not have home computers, Ms Brown this week set up
computer kiosks in San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Each kiosk
contains an Apple Macintosh personal computer containing a range of
information about the candidate, including recordings of some of her
campaign speeches.
Claiming to break new ground in the use of technology in a political
campaign, Ms Brown said that the technology 'combines two elements that have
contributed to California's economy and creativity - Hollywood and the
Silicon Valley'.
When it comes to election day, the Internet will also be the place for
up-to-the-minute news on election returns.
The full text of the bulky California ballot pamphlet is already online via
http://www. election. digital. com and the digital campaign cybertrail is
spreading to other states. Through Project Vote Smart, computer terminals
laden with voter information are being placed in public libraries in several
states.
To find out where California's gubernatorial candidates stand on the
controversial issues of immigration, taxes and health care in the November 8
election, send E-mail to petewilson@delphi. com or katbrown@netcom. com -
and wait to see if the computer promises are kept.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Heseltine nears defeat over Post Office sale: Backbench
rebellion likely to make privatisation too risky for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night on the brink of shelving plans to privatise
the Post Office in a move that would deal a bitter blow to Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
A final decision on whether to include a Post Office bill in next year's
legislative timetable was scheduled for today's meeting of the cabinet.
Barring the unexpected, ministers are likely to conclude that privatisation
would be too risky.
But there were warnings last night for Mr John Major, the prime minister,
that he could face a backlash from the party's right wing if he backs away
from the proposals completely.
The likely retreat follows a meeting at Westminster yesterday at which a
group of some 15 Tory backbenchers - more than enough to cancel out the
government's Commons majority of 14 - told Mr Heseltine they would be unable
to support sell-off proposals.
Some rebels are understood to have told him that they would regard even the
sale of a minority stake in the corporation as unacceptable. Sir Keith
Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford, who attended the meeting said
afterwards: 'There is still plenty of blue water between us.'
Downing Street said last night that Mr Heseltine and Mr David Hunt,
chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, would report back to their cabinet
colleagues today.
Mr Heseltine told MPs earlier this week that unless privatisation plans were
included in the Queen's Speech on November 16, the project would have to be
dropped until after the next general election.
Yesterday's developments came after Mr Heseltine tabled a complicated plan
for partial privatisation in a last-ditch attempt to rescue the proposed
sale.
That would have involved a 40 per cent sale of the Royal Mail, the Post
Office's letters division, and the transfer of another 20 per cent to an
independent trust.
The remaining 40 per cent would have remained in the public sector for at
least two parliaments. Management of the Royal Mail would have been free to
make investment decisions.
Mr Heseltine's move was being portrayed last night in some circles as a
tactical error. One Tory backbencher said it had given MPs the impression Mr
Heseltine was trying to privatise the Post Office by the back door.
A retreat would also deal a blow to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who
has been every bit as vigorous as Mr Heseltine in promoting privatisation.
MPs who attended yesterday's 45-minute meeting, at which a government whip
is also understood to have been present, afterwards expressed confidence
that Mr Heseltine would have to abandon his plans.
Mr Robert Hicks, the MP for Cornwall South East, said it would now be
'unwise to make any reference to privatisation of the Post Office in the
Queen's Speech'.
Mr Gary Waller, MP for Keighley, said Mr Heseltine had given the impression
that he had failed to convince the cabinet's industry committee that he
could get legislation through parliament without wrecking amendments.
Mr Steven Day, Tory MP for Cheadle, said rebels were 'standing firm in their
belief that the Post Office and Royal Mail should remain within the public
sector'.
Sir Keith Speed said it was time for the government to have 'a fresh look'
at whether it was possible to adapt Treasury rules to give the corporation
greater commercial freedom.

FT  03 NOV 94 / Hualon project faces fresh doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Pounds 61m grant to Hualon, a Taiwanese group, to build a
Belfast textile plant was plunged into renewed controversy yesterday when a
director of Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board resigned in
protest at the project.
Mrs Jennifer d'Abo said she had quit because the board, which is responsible
for the Dollars 255m project, had failed to give her satisfactory
information about the legal and financial arrangements for the deal.
She said the board had refused to answer questions about a recent stock
market scandal involving subsidiaries and executives of Hualon, and had
refused her request for a special board meeting to reconsider the deal.
'I am not happy to agree to going forward with a very large project when
there have been accusations of scandal, share transactions (and) land
transactions . . . to which I have not been given satisfactory answers,' she
said.
She said there should be a proper inquiry into the project, the largest
manufacturing investment in Northern Ireland since the state-backed De
Lorean car venture, which collapsed with heavy losses in the late 1970s. The
Commons Northern Ireland committee is already investigating the proposed
plant. British textiles manufacturers are considering challenging in the
European Court the European Commission's approval this year of the Pounds
61m grant.
Mrs d'Abo is chairman of the Moyses Stevens florists group and headed
Rymans, the stationery chain in the 1980s. She said she and other IDB
directors had repeatedly raised questions about the Hualon project since it
was first submitted to them more than two years ago. The IDB said last night
that it had declined Mrs d'Abo's request for a special board meeting last
month because it wanted first to talk with Hualon executives.
It said it had made 'very considerable efforts' to answer her questions. The
last board meeting had discussed her objections and reviewed developments
relating to the project, to which no grant had yet been paid.
The IDB said there was no justification for suspending the progress of the
project. If no legal challenge were mounted by the end of this month to the
Commission's approval of aid, it expected the company to go ahead.
Questions remain over Pounds 61m Hualon grant, Page 9

and the US Treasury tried to talk the US currency up after it sank to
Y96.05, a fresh post-1945 low.
The dollar's renewed weakness prompted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's
finance minister, to warn that the country's economic recovery was under
threat.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said the dollar's dive was
'inconsistent with the fundamentals of a strong investment-led recovery' in
the US. 'Continuation of recent foreign-exchange trends would be
counterproductive for the US and the world economy,' he said.
He promised to monitor developments closely in co-operation with the other
six members of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. However,
apart from the Bank of Japan, which regularly buys dollars, the Fed was
alone in its support of the currency. Traders estimated that it spent
between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn on buying dollars in the currency
markets.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said: 'I welcome the fact that the
American monetary authorities have clearly expressed their interest in a
strong dollar.'
Fed support helped to take the dollar back to Y97.60 in New York trading,
and lifted it to DM1.515 from an earlier low of DM1.491.
Signs of continued expansion in yesterday's 'Beige Book' report on US
economic conditions added to the dollar turmoil. The report alarmed
financial markets by renewing questions over whether the Fed had acted fast
enough to head off inflationary pressures.
The Fed intervention provided an initial boost to US stocks, but share
prices later fell and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 26.24 at
3,837.13.
European stock markets were weighed down by the dollar's initial decline and
by Tuesday's falls on Wall Street. In Paris, the CAC-40 index was 1.7 per
cent lower, while the Dax index fell 1.3 per cent in after-hours trading. In
London, the FT-SE 100 Index, having been 26 points lower, rallied on news of
Fed intervention to end the day 15 points down at 3,081.3. Since taking
office at the start of 1993, the Clinton administration has been dogged by
the perception that it was happy with a fall in the dollar. Mr Bentsen's
statement yesterday was needed to offset the damage he had caused with
recent remarks.
But analysts said the dollar would go lower without the active support of
the Bundesbank and other central banks. Mr Avinash Persaud, at J. P. Morgan,
said: 'I think the market is going to brush this aside unless it sees the
Bundesbank come in.'
The Tokyo markets were closed this morning.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Allied Domecq to lift Spain Alecq stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Domecq, the drinks group, said it would lift its stake in Spain
Alecq, owner of the Domecq group, from 73 to almost 100 per cent.
The share deal is the result of a put option granted to the Domecq family
when Allied paid Pounds 739m for control of Pedro Domecq, the Spanish drinks
producer, in March.
Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa, part of the Domecq family, said the Pounds 280.4m
option would be exercised by December 30. Mr Mora-Figueroa sits on Allied
Domecq's board with executive responsibility for Domecq.
Allied said the option had been exercised considerably earlier than
expected. The option enabled the family to sell its 27 per cent stake in
Spain Alecq within six years of the acquisition.
Mr Tony Pratt, director of Allied Domecq corporate affairs, said: 'At the
time, both parties thought it might be rather longer than this to exercise
the put option. They have now chosen to do so and this is entirely due to
their own circumstances.'
The group said the price of the option was likely to be reduced because it
included an element in US dollars. The final figure will not be announced
until the option is exercised.
At the time of the Domecq acquisition, Allied claimed the deal made it the
world's second largest spirits producer. The group has since embarked on a
series of disposals to concentrate on spirits and wines.
Last week the group said it was negotiating the sale of its Dutch brewing
subsidiary to Interbrew of Belgium.
Last month it announced the Pounds 74.3m sale of 641 pubs to Scottish
Amicable, the insurer, and the pension fund of Strathclyde Regional Council,
Scotland's biggest local authority.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Borealis advances in third
quarter with DKr340m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borealis, the petrochemicals joint venture formed this year between Norway's
Statoil and Finland's Neste, forged ahead in the third quarter, reporting
operating profits of DKr340m (Dollars 57.6m) and a profit after net
financial items of DKr256m in the third quarter.
This took operating profit for nine months to DKr330m and pre-tax profit to
DKr8m on sales up about 12 per cent to DKr10.3bn.
Mr Juha Rantanen, chief executive, said the third quarter brought one of the
sharpest improvements in profitability in the industry since 1988.
He attributed the improvement to strong demand in Europe, Asia and the US,
with an increase in both sales volume and in prices for the group's main
products, polyethylene and polypropylene.
Third-quarter polypropylene and polyethylene prices in Europe increased by
10 per cent and 20 per cent respectively from the second quarter while sales
volume advanced 7 per cent.
The strength of demand was attributed to consumer demand and to inventory
building by customers.
Mr Rantanen said Borealis had secured long- and short-time financing
facilities from its core banks. He said, 'We have become fully independent
for financing.'
Borealis said its forecast for its first full year of operations was
positive, with a final quarter which should show an improvement on the
third-quarter figures.
However, Mr Rantanen said, however, there was still some uncertainty about
the durability of the present recovery and continued concern about the
fundamental problems of the European petrochemical industry, such as slower
long-term demand growth and competitiveness compared to other regions.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hershey shake-up cuts 400 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hershey Foods, the biggest US confectionery maker, yesterday said it planned
to carry out a restructuring over the next 12-15 months that would mean the
loss of about 400 jobs and result in a charge of Dollars 97m-Dollars 105m to
net profits in this year's fourth quarter.
In last year's fourth quarter, Hershey made net profits of Dollars 92.2m.
Mr Kenneth Wolfe, chairman and chief executive, said part of the reason for
the restructuring was the signing of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
In response, Hershey was combining its confectionery operations in the US,
Canada and Mexico into a consolidated unit to be called Hershey Chocolate
North America.
'In doing so, we hope to capitalise on Hershey Chocolate USA's strengths to
improve our competitive positions in the Canadian and Mexican markets and
enhance our overall returns,' Mr Wolfe said.
Like other manufacturers of branded goods, Hershey is facing a growing
competitive threat from cheaper own-label products.
Mr Wolfe said that another reason for the restructuring was to make sure
that the company was making the most productive use of all its assets.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American schools are becoming more violent, not only in big cities but in
smaller towns and surburbs, according to a 700-city survey to be published
today by the National League of Cities. Only 11 per cent of the communities
surveyed said violence was not a problem. The survey listed 44 per cent of
suburban cities and towns, nearly two-thirds with populations under 50,000.
One out of four reported incidents involving serious injuries or deaths in
the past year and 40 per cent said gangs were a significant problem.
Among other findings, 70 per cent said police were being assigned to patrol
schools and 19 per cent said metal detectors were used to find weapons. Over
the past five years, 38 per cent of the cities said the problem has risen
noticeably, and 90 per cent of the cities send police to school athletic
events. The study quoted Atlanta councilwoman Ms Carolyn Long as saying
'school is getting rougher in a dangerous way. The academic challenges are
being made more difficult by the disturbing presence and growing fear of
crime and violence in our schools.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Salinas rejects notion of one complex plot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico delivered his final state-of-the union
address yesterday, offering a robust defence of his six years in office one
month before he hands over to his successor, Mr Ernesto Zedillo.
Mr Salinas sought to answer critics that his government had put economic
reform before political change, arguing that 'democracy cannot flourish. . .
when financial disorder, deficits and inflation are exacerbated.' He
asserted that 'experience shows that abrupt political changes promoted from
above without the consensus of parties and the support of society merely
lead to a break with the old without consolidating the new.'
Nevertheless, Mr Salinas said significant democratic progress had been made
during his administration, and 'pluralism is now the norm in our public
affairs.' The high turnout and generally trouble-free August presidential
elections 'mark our passage towards a better democracy.'
The outgoing president sought to explain the shocks Mexico has suffered this
year - namely the peasant revolt in the southern state of Chiapas, the
assassinations of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, and Mr Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the ruling party - as a
reaction against his administration's economic and social reforms.
'I do not resort to the facile solution of an overriding plot as a general
explanation for these acts of violence. . . These grave events reflect the
action of isolated individuals or groups, but they may also be spurred by a
feeling of rejection for changes that have been made.'
The president announced that foreign currency reserves were Dollars 17.24bn
at the end of October, a fraction more than the level two weeks ago. He said
the economy would grow by almost 3 per cent this year, implying growth of
about 4 per cent in the second half of the year. He said that for the third
year in a row there would be no fiscal deficit.
Mr Salinas accepted some responsibility for the uprising in Chiapas,
referring to 'excessive caution' in not taking preventative security
measures and failings of local government. He reiterated his call for a
peaceful solution.
In a tacit admission of the problems his administration had not tackled, Mr
Salinas said Mexico still faced 'a major challenge of justice. Our economy
is healthier, but must still provide many new jobs. . . our freedoms are
greater. . . but many constraints and inequities remain which must be
corrected before we can become the democratic, modern nation we aspire to
be.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada plans to dilute its traditional hospitality towards immigrants under
a new long-term policy unveiled yesterday.
Besides cutting the 1995 immigration quota by about 12 per cent, Mr Sergio
Marchi, immigration minister, announced tighter curbs on family members
seeking to join relatives already in Canada.
The government will in future place a greater emphasis on attracting
entrepreneurs and other independent immigrants with skills or wealth to
contribute to the economy.
The refugee quota will rise by as much as three-quarters to 24,000-32,000 a
year.
Studies indicate that new settlers in the family reunification category,
especially parents and grandparents, place a relatively heavy burden on
health and social services.
Mr Marchi said the authorities may require bonds to be posted by immigrants
sponsoring their families.
The immigration clampdown coincides with pressure on the government to
review Canada's multi-culturalism policy, under which ethnic communities are
encouraged - often with support from public funds - to retain their distinct
identity.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (21): Nightmare at a top
American school - The first three terms are portrayed with wit and
self-deprecation as a gruesome mental assault course / Business education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

'SNAPSHOTS FROM HELL (THE MAKING OF AN MBA)' By Peter Robinson Nicholas
Brealey Pounds 9.99, 286 pages
Perhaps the most surprising thing about Peter Robinson's book is that it is
actually a rather entertaining read. One could imagine lots of MBA students
recounting the experiences of their first year at business school and the
results being decidedly dull.
Robinson, however, enjoys a number of advantages. For a start, he can write,
a skill no doubt developed in his earlier White House job drafting speeches
for President Reagan. He also describes an interesting business school era
(1988-90), when the yuppie union card, as he calls the MBA, was already
starting to lose some of its shine, as well as an interesting institution
(Stanford University Graduate School of Business) which, by his account,
appears to have been in some turmoil at the time.
Above all, however, Robinson is a sufficiently sympathetic and sensitive
character for readers to want to know whether he survived his nightmare, how
it changed him and what judgments on business education he ultimately made.
Many of Robinson's difficulties arise from the fact that he is a 'poet'  -
Stanford-speak for students with degrees in subjects such as history or
English as opposed to engineering or mathematics, and who instinctively
prefer ideas rather than numbers. Large parts of the more
mathematically-based bits of the syllabus are therefore at best baffling, at
worst likely to make him 'flunk' the whole programme.
He has periods of relaxation, elation and joy but on the whole the first
three terms of a full-time MBA at one of America's top schools are portrayed
with wit and self-deprecation as a gruesome mental assault course - at least
for poets, that is.
There is some interest in the other characters - Conor, a fellow poet with
spouse and family in tow, struggling with 27-hour days; Zen, a Japanese who
finally cannot bring himself to make the cultural leap and work for a US
firm; and Mr Cool and Mr Perfect who, as their nicknames imply, found it all
easy enough to womanise and improve their suntans. Generally, though,
Robinson's classmates are types one might recognise anywhere.
What is more provoking is the light this book sheds on the value of an MBA.
Things have moved on on both sides of the Atlantic since the author's
graduation - a pity, in fact, that he wasn't a bit quicker on the draw with
his pen - but the observations are still instructive for anyone
contemplating business school today.
Even a school with Stanford's reputation is sometimes guilty in Robinson's
view of sloppy and ill-focused teaching (the class is in open revolt at one
point), close friendships are hard to forge, especially in the early
pressure-cooker days, and the networking-job-seeking mentality is even more
obsessive than one imagines.
Robinson cites an iconoclastic member of the faculty who dreams of running
two MBA classes side by side: one would follow the normal curriculum, the
other would do no work and spend the time playing golf or on the beach. His
point is that given many employers' starry-eyed attitude to the MBA, the
more leisurely lot would be just as successful in the job market as the
'genuine' students.
Robinson's own search to some extent proves the point - an offer from Robert
Maxwell during a meeting in which he literally did not have to open his
mouth. Wisely, he turned that one down, although the subsequent decision to
accept Rupert Murdoch's shilling was scarcely more auspicious. Robinson
later fell victim to a cost-cutting programme implemented by the Australian
tycoon.
Based on the class of 1988-90 as a whole, the conclusion is that business
school is not necessarily a straight and easy road to riches. But in the
end, Robinson betrays an affectionate regard for the institution which put
him through hell: he says the union card, the broadening experience, the
self-confidence, the contacts and (in his case, at any rate) the perspective
on life, are all worth having.
A case, perhaps, of not biting too hard the hand that feeds you.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (22): 'Winners and losers'
theory - Whatever their rhetoric, most western governments have all but
abandoned a practical commitment to full employment / Macroeconomics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'THE GOALS OF MACROECONOMIC POLICY' By Martin Prachowny Routledge, Pounds
13.99, 217 pages
Martin Prachowny's book has as its central theme the observation that
macroeconomic policies generate winners and losers: there is always a
conflict of interest, and policies that make everyone better off do not
exist.
The most important conflict that Prachowny identifies is between two groups
of workers: on one hand those in secure jobs, on the other those in
relatively insecure jobs and the unemployed.
In a democratic system, the conduct of policy is decided by the 'median
voter', Mr/Ms Average, who belong to the 'secure' group. This group is
unlikely to lose their job except under extreme circumstances, and are
relatively unenthusiastic about funding expansionary government programmes
for reducing unemployment.
Those not in secure jobs form a minority, and hence the democratic system
does not deliver policies which would benefit them.
This observation certainly has a ring of truth about it for those who
witnessed the surprise victory of the Conservative party in the UK under
John Major in 1991. Whatever their rhetoric, at the end of the day most
western governments have all but abandoned a practical commitment to full
employment.
There were two main pillars of 'Keynesian' policy for 25 years after the
second world war. First, a belief that 'full employment' was achievable, and
that it was desirable. Second, a belief that governments could stabilise the
economy around full employment by a 'countercyclical' demand management
policy (boosting demand in recessions, restraining it in booms).
Both of these pillars rested on the foundation that it was possible in the
context of a big depression to have an expansion of output and employment
that made everyone better off.
Government spending would take people out of unemployment, and they would
then consume goods, thus generating more employment and profits.
Prachowny denies this, believing that an increase in employment cannot
happen without a fall in real wages: an increase in employment which
benefits the unemployed leads to a fall in the wages of those in employment.
This notion has little empirical validity: indeed, most empirical analysis
shows that the real wages of workers rise in booms. The power of those in
employment to obtain higher wages is increased when unemployment is falling.
More importantly, Prachowny does not take into account the fact that
government spending is itself useful.
There is a growing body of research in the US and elsewhere that public
investment and education expenditure have a positive impact on productivity
in the private sector. Just think of the huge costs imposed on British
industry by the lack of an adequate transport infrastructure.
Taking these factors together might indicate that the winners might be more
numerous than Prachowny suggests.
There is a clear truth in some of what Prachowny says. However, this book
mentions neither poverty nor inequality. The years since 1980 have seen a
dramatic increase in both poverty and inequality in most western economies.
In European countries, the poverty is primarily related to unemployment: in
the US it is primarily due to low wages for the unskilled.
The real split is between the unskilled and the skilled. Job security is
part of this difference (although since the shakeout of middle management
and the financial sector, few jobs are secure in the old sense). The
unskilled are becoming redundant technologically, and are competing with
workers in China and eastern Europe. The relative wages of the unskilled are
falling, and are likely to continue falling. The wages of the skilled have
continued to rise. The unskilled are likely to endure more frequent or
prolonged unemployment.
The labour market is thus divided into two separate parts, which are driven
by different factors. The growing social and economic distance between the
skilled and the unskilled gives rise to the features that Prachowny
highlights. The key feature is that the wages of the skilled are not related
to those of the unskilled: but the taxes of the skilled are related to
government expenditure.
Those who benefit from relative private affluence rarely feel motivated to
pay taxes to fund public affluence. The key developments in the labour
market since 1980, and the politics of Thatcher and Reagan, are ignored by
Prachowny who emphasises the continuity of the problem facing politicians.
From an economist's perspective, this book is a strange brew. Most of the
parts are not strong: neither theory nor empirics. The historical policy
analysis of the US 1948-1990 is perhaps the most interesting chapter. At the
end of the book, one is not only left to wonder whether the book has missed
some of the most important developments: one is also left wondering whether
the parts form a consistent whole. While the book provides interesting
insights and a romp through several ideas, it should not be taken with much
more than a pinch of salt.

The Polish economy

'THE POLISH ECONOMY: CRISIS, REFORM AND TRANSFORMATION' By Ben Slay
Princeton University Press, Pounds 26.5, 229 pages
Since the advent to power in late 1989 of its first non-communist government
for more than 40 years, Poland has become the testing ground for many of the
most radical ideas, proposed by both Polish and western economists, to
transform the old and discredited centrally-administered economies. This
excellent and highly readable book offers a well-balanced assessment of
those reforms.
'Shock therapy' as applied to the Polish patient, has meant massive currency
devaluation; abolition of subsidies and of administered price-setting by
government; privatisation of state enterprises; and the building of
financial and legal institutions to help oil the new marketised order. As
Slay concludes, there are many signs of progress in achieving the objectives
of marketisation.
However, the resistance to change by those who benefited from the old order,
and the subsequent election of a left-wing parliament in September 1993 in
response to widespread dissatisfaction, suggests that crisis continues to be
a theme running through Polish development, whatever the optimism generated
by 1989 and its aftermath.
It is Slay's rooting of modern Polish history in Poland's complex past and
emphasis on the forces of continuity which distinguishes this analysis of a
former communist economy from those whose framework is simply one of the
transition from 'socialism' to 'capitalism', as though history began in
1948. As Slay shows, there is plenty in Poland's past which has echoes in
the present.
Continuity therefore becomes central to analysing recent economic history.
Slay shows how state control of the country's economy under socialism was
nothing new, going back to the strong Russian, Austrian and Prussian state
control under the partition, and the state control of banks and sections of
industry in the second republic.
Attempts to combine elements of 'the market' and state planning under
'socialism' go back to similar strategies in the inter-war period. Poland's
ability to cope with the 'shock therapy' of the Balcerowicz Plan of 1990 is
partly explained by the limited, but important, reforms made by the old
regime during the 1980s.
Although politically repressive, the Jaruzelski regime did institute
economic reforms which gave enterprises more autonomy, especially in trade
with the west, and also partial currency convertibility towards the end of
the decade. Allied to an increasingly large dollarised parallel economy
which grew throughout the 1980s, these legacies of the old system provided a
base for a less constrained private sector after 1989.
However important history may be, it is Slay's assessment of the period
since 1989 which is going to be of most interest to observers of east and
central Europe. On the positive side of the balance there is currency
convertibility, price reform, privatisation and macroeconomic stabilisation
(which includes both bringing inflation under control and some considerable
success in switching to exports to western markets).
On the negative side, there is some loss of output, rising unemployment,
increasing poverty, and a practically bankrupt, and still largely
state-owned, banking system. Even looking at the negatives, the fall in
output relies too heavily on official statistics which understate private
activity. There is some doubt as to what proportion of the registered
unemployed are really without work; data on poverty are heavily dependent on
where the poverty line is drawn and what constitutes a minimum basket of
goods; and as far as the banking system is concerned, enterprise debts to
banks are a phenomenon plaguing most of the post-communist economies and
will obviously take time to resolve.
The great merit of Slay's book is that he gives us many reasons rooted in
events since 1989 to be optimistic about Poland's transformation. But he
also gives us many reasons from Poland's recent and distant past to make us
pessimistic, too. The role of the west continues to be crucial, as ever, to
Poland's future. Having adopted much of the radical strategy urged on it by
the US and the European Union, Poland deserves the foreign investment and
aid which are essential to see the strategy through. Once again, Poland's
future is heavily dependent on foreign capital and foreign powers.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (20): Handle with care - The
problem is that the criteria the authors use are too crude / Hostile
takeover bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON

<TEXT>
'HOSTILE TAKEOVERS' by Tim Jenkinson and Colin Mayer McGraw-Hill Book
Company Pounds 37.95, 187 pages
Quoted companies worried about the threat of hostile takeover bids will gain
little comfort from a new book by two Oxford academics. After a detailed
study of all hostile bids in the UK between January 1989 and March 1990 the
authors conclude that the chances of a company which is the subject of a
cash bid remaining independent are slim, however good its financial record.
Indeed, they argue that there is little link between a target's previous
financial performance and the likelihood of its attracting or surviving any
hostile bid. This may be true. Unfortunately, the evidence presented
provides limited support for the claim.
The authors divide the 42 hostile bids during the period into three
categories - 16 where there was clear evidence of financial failure; 10
where there was evidence of possible financial failure; and 16 where there
was no such evidence. In each of the first two groups, six bids were
successful but in the third eight succeeded.
The problem is that the criteria the authors use for establishing financial
failure are too crude. Clear evidence was deemed to be present if the share
price of the target decline relative to the FT All Share index in at least
one of the two years prior to the bid, and there was a decline in either
earnings per share or dividends in the year immediately preceding the bid.
If none of these applied there was no evidence of financial failure.
The earnings and dividend hurdles are too low. During the period of the bids
companies were reporting profits generated at the height of the boom. Many
of the companies that increased earnings and dividends at that time would
have been generally viewed as underperformers.
The share price is a better yardstick, although it would have been
preferable to compare the performance against the company's sector index.
Even then it needs to handled with care. Of the companies where the authors
suggest there was no evidence of financial failure, two - Pearl and Higgs &amp;
Hill - underperformed the FT index in the year up to the day before the bid.
The fact that their shares jumped after the bid was announced is hardly the
point.
In the case of Chamberlain Phipps, Laing Properties and Camford Engineering,
the shares underperformed until a few days before the bid when rumours
started to hit the market. Shares in DRG were buoyed up by bid rumours for
months before the Pembridge bid appeared and few impartial observers would
have denied there were questions about its financial performance.
The authors themselves admit that according to their tests BAT Industries
showed no sign of financial failure ahead of the bid from Hoylake. Yet the
bidders' argument that the management was denying shareholders value by not
demerging some of BAT's business was borne out by subsequent events. After
the bid failed the management spun off several businesses leaving the share
price significantly higher than before the bid.
All this is not to deny that well-managed companies can be the target of
successful hostile takeover bids. Yet the authors fail to demonstrate that
it is widespread or indeed that it is a serious problem. They merely state
that that UK companies' unusual vulnerability to takeover 'does not
necessarily produce appropriate incentive structures for management and
that, as a result, corporate performance may in some cases be adversely
affected'.
Even if this is true, the obvious solution would be to design incentive
structures to ensure managements benefit from hostile bids that enhance
shareholder value rather than to make hostile bids more difficult.
The authors repeat the popular view that there may be a link between the
prevalence of hostile bids in the UK and the low level of company-funded
research and development. They do not attempt to explain why the management
of Glaxo was happy to spend Pounds 858m on research and development last
year. Instead, they propose that companies with large research and
development budgets or other long-term investments should be able to erect
some limited technical defences to takeover.
While the authors stress that these should be temporary measures implemented
with the agreement of shareholders, the idea requires an odd view of
shareholders' psychology. To convince shareholders to agree to the takeover
defence, the company would have to demonstrate that the planned investment,
which would supposedly make it vulnerable to takeover, was in shareholders'
best interests. Yet if its shareholders were convinced by the plan the
company would not be vulnerable to takeover.
Only if shareholders could not trust themselves to resist a takeover would
they agree to such a self-denying ordinance.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (18): Distilled experience - The
industry still hasn't shrugged off its plastic daffodil image / Sales
Promotion

'SALES PROMOTION IN POSTMODERN MARKETING' By Christian Petersen and Alan
Toop Gower Publishing, Pounds 39.50, 192 pages
The world of sales promotion ought to receive more serious critical
attention. Sales promotion continues to account for a fast-growing share of
corporate marketing budgets: already, we are told, a higher proportion than
expenditure on media.
Heinz, which has run effective promotions offering a free car a day for 100
days, probably had good reasons for recently announcing a shift of spending
from TV to targeted promotions. Yet Hoover's free flights offer which
sounded too good to be true failed because of confusion over the small print
and inept administration.
So what type of promotions work and when? Where is the evidence that
promotional activities targeted at consumers through the letterbox, at the
point of sale, via packaging, over the phone, even by fax, are more or less
effective than press, poster and TV advertising? Some of the author's case
material and examination of recent promotions is certainly illuminating.
The sales promotion industry has come a long way, but still hasn't shrugged
off its traditional plastic daffodil image. Outside the more vibrant
specialist agencies, the business tends to be seen as tactical, but also
peripheral, even ephemeral.
Understandably, advertising agencies have blinkered views, suspicious of any
techniques other than pure, powerful media advertising to build brand
awareness and value.
A good example of the switch, which reflects the impact of change in markets
and marketing is that advertising league tables are no longer headed by the
big brands, but by the powerful retail chains. The combined effect of
competition from retailers' brands, pressure on margins and contributions to
store groups' own advertising is clearly forcing more brand manufacturers to
cut back on advertising and look for leap-frogging promotional techniques
with faster direct impact on sales.
Surprisingly few 'insider' books have focused knowledgeably and objectively
on sales promotion. Alan Toop and the late Christian Petersen both founded
leading sales promotion consultancies, created some spectacular campaigns
and wrote several of the more enlightening books on the practice. Their
latest, Sales Promotion in Postmodern Marketing, examines the background,
'the golden age of marketing' - the 1950s to the 1970s - which saw the
arrival of independent television, the assault of Madison Avenue
commercials, the emergence of supermarkets followed by superstores, offering
more and more shopping convenience, variety and choice.
For example, the authors found more than 20 versions of Persil alone, 150
brands of cereal and more than 30 different toothpastes. Add typically huge
selections of fruit and vegetables, bakery lines, meat and fish and drinks,
plus, in more cases, in-store pharmacies, newsagents and dry cleaners, and
it is clear that the concept of one-stop shopping has overtaken any earlier
preference for small specialist shops.
For brand manufacturers to elbow their way onto the crowded shelves, compete
with own-labels and gain attention, the two overriding priorities became new
product launches and line extensions for added shelf space, and sales
promotions.
One of the key differences between advertising and sales promotion, the
authors explain, is that sales promotion invites participation or
exhortation to act now. It encourages response whether the promotion takes
the form of cash rebates, extra product free, coupons, contests or
competitions, premiums, prizes or free samples.
Even they find it surprising, however, that so little senior management time
is paid to ensuring maximum impact for every penny spent in this area.
The authors admit that sales promotion is still less well understood and
less closely studied than advertising. It is one thing to claim expenditure
on sales promotion and other below-the-line activities now exceeds spending
on media advertising. Is it too much to offer evidence and analysis?
The book offers a rich seam of distilled experience and fresh insights. What
is still lacking is research and rationale.

'IDLE HANDS, THE EXPERIENCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, 1790 TO 1990' By John Burnett
Routledge, Pounds 14.99, 384 pages
If the Labour party insists on clinging to its goal of full employment when
it compiles its manifesto at the time of the next general election it will
inevitably fall back on a single historical example to convince a sceptical
electorate that it is anything more than a pipe dream.
The two golden decades of virtually full employment after the second world
war, are Labour's beacon of hope and, as such, would seem to have all the
promise of a Cornish wrecker's lantern. The period was exceptional,
historically atypical, and unlikely to be repeated, concludes John Burnett
in Idle Hands, a social history of unemployment in the 200 years up to 1990.
After reading this comprehensive and thoughtful work it is difficult to
disagree. Unlike the cyclical nature of many of the economic factors
associated with unemployment in much of this study, the problems of a
post-industrial economy, he argues, differ from those of the past when a
large manufacturing base survived through periods of depression.
That said, there are many lessons in this work of relevance to today, not
least his finding that reductions in unemployment relief as a deterrence in
response to a suspicion that the unemployed were workshy or scroungers, did
nothing to create jobs.
Burnett examines the underlying reasons for and conditions surrounding
unemployment. He focuses on the experience of the handloom weavers, a large
and successful semi-skilled elite of the 18th and early 19th century, and
considers their plight in the light of today's socio-economic conditions.
The handloom weavers enjoyed social prominence and comparative wealth among
the working classes for a brief period towards the end of the 18th century.
Developments in power-loom weaving emerged when the Napoleonic wars were
coming to an end. Thus, just as the working population swelled, the number
of available jobs was declining.
Ironically it was the very success and efficiency of handloom weaving,
speeded even further by the appearance of Kay's flying shuttle, that created
the incentive to mechanise spinning. This led to large supplies of cotton
yarn. Finding themselves in short supply, the handloom weavers briefly
prospered as technologies struggled with the more difficult task of
mechanising weaving.
The very developments that made weaving easier, however, also increased the
use of cheaper unskilled labour to fill demand. Jobs were taken by farm
labourers often working alongside women and children.
As the Napoleonic wars ended, releasing thousands of servicemen into an
already squeezed labour market, it seems hardly surprising that outbreaks of
farm machinery burning and Luddism became commonplace. Some 390 threshing
machines were smashed in 1830-31. Rioting was widespread. More than a
thousand rioters were convicted; half of them were imprisoned and half
transported - and 19 were hanged.
The period coincided with the new political philosophy of laisser faire.
There was to be no employment protection from parliament. As French
blockades cut down supplies of raw cotton during the war years, the
handlooming industry plunged into depression.
In the early days of Luddism, Burnett notes, power looms were still in their
infancy and he sees them more as a focus of discontent rather than its chief
cause. While Luddism itself was only part of a much broader unrest, it was
brought to prominence by the intensity of its violence associated with
attacks on mills. The weavers became the backbone of a politicised movement
that culminated in an armed rising in the West Riding and an attempt to
capture Huddersfield in 1820.
Further insurrection occurred in Scotland. Military intervention, arrests,
hangings and transportations were repeated in many industrial towns. As
depression spread some communities faced famine, Chartism began to flourish
as a quasi-revolutionary movement and mill attacks became more organised and
intensified across the Lancashire cotton belt and into the Yorkshire Wollen
mills.
The unrest precipitated the first large debate on the economic and social
consequences of technological change. The debate polarised on familiar
lines, one side arguing that mechanisation increased demand for labour and
was essential to remain competitive, the other side arguing, somewhat
nostalgically, that it would lead to the break-up of the family unit and
moral decline.
Unemployment today, writes Burnett somewhat bleakly, has become a continuing
feature of social and economic life. We cannot expect other sectors to
compensate for the dramatic decline in Britain's industrial base, he says.
The Labour party may yet be reminded of Sir Keith Joseph, the former
Conservative minister's words in 1978. He said: 'Full employment is not in
the gift of Government. It should not be promised and it cannot be
provided.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (16): Focus on profits curbed
reforms - The authors leave the NYSE with a stark choice: adapt or die / New
York Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
'REVOLUTION ON WALL STREET: THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE NEW YORK STOCK
EXCHANGE' by Marshall E Blume, Jeremy J Siegel and Dan Rottenberg Norton,
Pounds 19.95, 320 pages
The prologue to Revolution on Wall Street opens with an irresistible quote:
'You gentlemen are making a great mistake. The Exchange is a perfect
institution.'
So said stockbroker Richard Whitney in 1934. The then president of the NYSE,
Whitney was telling the US Senate of his opposition to plans to create the
Securities and Exchange Commission, a watchdog that would police the rapidly
expanding US financial markets. In spite of his confidence, Whitney fooled
no one. The SEC was duly set up, and four years later Whitney himself was
imprisoned for the theft of his client's securities.
In its 200 years, the NYSE has had its fair share of Richard Whitneys. Yet
Revolution on Wall Street does not dwell long on the crooks and con-men. The
book's main purpose is to tell the story of the NYSE, how the world's
greatest stock exchange ended up today as an impressive, still-powerful
institution, but one besieged by technological change and competitive forces
that threaten its very existence. It does this very well.
Although the narrative occasionally digresses into technical issues - such
as the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system; the development
of new investment theories and techniques by academics and professional
money managers; and the oil and inflation crises of the 1970s - the authors
(two University of Pennsylvania professors, Marshall Blume and Jeremy
Siegel, and financial journalist Dan Rottenberg) manage to keep their eyes
on the ball most of the time.
At each juncture in the story, they explain how exterior forces were
fashioning a new, less regulated, financial system, and how the NYSE stood
by while the financial world around it was reshaped.
In the 1970s, for example, the book tells how the birth of the financial
futures and options markets in Chicago left the New York markets, and the
NYSE in particular, trailing in the wake of innovation.
Within a few years, the enormous popularity of stock index futures such as
the future on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 meant that share price levels were
increasingly being determined in the futures trading pits in Chicago, and
not in New York on the NYSE's floor - as investors would discover to their
cost in October, 1987.
The authors also tell, in brisk and readable fashion, of the rise of the
institutional investor - a new, smarter version than the NYSE had ever
encountered before - of their revolt against the fixed-commission system
that had for so long filled the pockets of the brokers with easy money, of
the breakdown of the securities clearing system, and of the arrival of the
first computers.
This is when the book's central theme - the Exchange's failure to adapt to
technological change - begins to emerge. In the 1970s, while the SEC was
promoting the establishment of an electronic system for centralising the
trading on all the nation's different exchanges and markets, and while small
regional exchanges and broking firms were using computer technology to
develop new methods of buying and selling securities that by-passed the
traditional trading floors, the NYSE was fiercely for the status quo.
By the 1980s, the new markets - such as the Nasdaq screen-based
'over-the-counter' trading system, and the 'third' and 'fourth' markets
where securities firms and institutions traded with each other or within
their own institutions - were flourishing, and the NYSE was losing market
share.
At this time, the NYSE was not entirely neglecting the new technology. It
invested millions in updating its trade processing, monitoring and
compliance systems. Yet, as the authors point out, the basic procedures for
trading securities at the Exchange hardly changed at all. Market-makers, or
'specialists', were still at their trading posts on the floor handling
transactions on behalf of brokers and their customers.
And while that system remained unchanged, investors, small and large, began
discovering other, newer systems which offered cheaper, more efficient
service - such as Bernard Madoff Securities' in-house market, which not only
offered to execute trades for no charge, but actually paid broking houses to
direct the flow of orders its way.
The reason why the NYSE has failed to adapt to change is simple, say the
authors: the Exchange is run by its members, the specialists and brokers,
whose overriding concern is their own profitability. The ancient structure
of the NYSE virtually guarantees that profitability - any reforms to alter
drastically the structure, would undermine it. Hence, the NYSE's resistance
to change.
The authors leave the NYSE with a stark choice: adapt or die. It should take
control of the Exchange away from the members, and start developing one or
more new trading systems to suit the needs of the investors, not the
intermediaries. Whether the NYSE's members will heed this advice is
doubtful.

'SUCCEEDING WITH CHANGE: IMPLEMENTING ACTION-DRIVEN STRATEGIES' by Tony
Eccles McGraw-Hill, Pounds 19.95, 256 pages
If there is a single Holy Grail in business today, it is how to manage
organisational change and transformation - or, put more realistically, how
to unleash change processes and then steer them so that they are neither
derailed nor run into the sand.
Managers all over the world would give their eye teeth - or even more - for
a reliable map through that minefield.
So it is not surprising that the publishing industry has spewed out a flood
of books on 'change' over the past few years, not only from the explosives
expert of the genre, Tom Peters, but also from less bombastic authors.
The trouble is that most of the books mislead most readers. There are four
reasons for this.
First, some books are far too simplistic to do justice to this multifaceted
subject. Second, it is so peppered with subtleties that, in their
introductory and closing chapters, most provide a simplistic or overstated
view of their message. In the very likely event that most people read only
part of the book, they get only half the message - or, worse, a damagingly
half-baked view of such key issues as the relative roles of top-down change
programmes and 'empowered' front-line workers.
This was an occupational hazard, for instance, with The Critical Path to
Corporate Renewal, an influential Harvard-published book in 1991. Only the
most skilful writers have managed to avoid this pitfall.
The third problem is that few books have provided much systematic, practical
guidance for the individual leader or manager on what to do when, and to (or
with) whom. Fourthly, almost all the books are American, and tend towards
the evangelistic.
In Succeeding With Change, Tony Eccles, who is an academic of unusually
practical bent and has a long-standing delight in contrariness, escapes the
fourth count by virtue of his Britishness. He also sets out to avoid the
other three.
On the first and third count, he does so with a vengeance. The book is far
from simplistic, yet a very practical guide for the manager; based on
Eccles' extensive experience with a string of British companies, it provides
both a framework for understanding change, and a set of principles for how
to execute it. As Charles Handy rightly declares in his back cover
endorsement: 'managers will love it.'
The trouble is that some may do so because they merely skim it, and so
succumb to Eccles' failure to avoid the second drawback of this genre:
initial overstatement.
If they read just his first few chapters, they will get the impression that
he rehabilitates old-fashioned macho management, in which the brain of the
organisation is located purely at the top, while lesser ranks dutifully
follow orders. Specifically, three of Eccles' messages will strike them:
that complex change can be accomplished far more quickly than most other
writers have advocated;
that this can be done by using 'concentrated power' to force or drive change
through;
and that empowerment of middle managers and front-line employees is
over-rated as a tool for achieving change successfully.
As with equivalent - although very different - overstatements at the start
of the Harvard volume, Eccles adds several layers of caveat to each of these
statements as the book progresses.
He concedes, for instance, that 'forced drive' only really works in
considerable crises and that, for change to last, it must be followed by the
'natural drive' which emerges when people lower down the organisation
realise the need to change, and develop consensus, commitment, teamwork and
enthusiasm.
In the last third of the book, he also clarifies his view on empowerment He
sees it as 'delegation revisited', and attacks American claims for it as
hyperbolic.
Yet, in his almost throwaway fashion, he eventually comes out as quite an
enthusiast for it. He says that, for organisations to compete effectively in
today's fast-moving, service-orientated economy, the freedom 'to use
discretion in making speedy judgments' must be extended not only to highly
qualified knowledge workers, but also to 'menial' employees - just so long
as the company is not facing a crisis, that is.
The core of the book consists of two useful sets of frameworks.
One advises senior managers how to behave in six different political
'contexts' of change. Four of them presuppose strong top-down power: change
by takeover; the injection of outside top management; succession by
insiders; and 'renovation change,' when the existing managers decide the
organisation needs changing. The latter - the most important because it is a
very difficult context in which to impose change - is dealt with
disappointingly, in four sparse pages.
As Eccles admits, concentrated power works far less well in the fifth
context: when the organisation is a professional service firm. The sixth
context, catalytic change through consultants, is an adjunct to the other
five.
Eccles' second framework is what he calls 14 'factors of change' which are
common to the different political contexts. Some factors, such as the need
for clarity of purpose, are self-evident. Others, such as the
(unfashionable) importance of structure, and the dilemma over how open to be
with one's colleagues and staff, are far from obvious.
In spite of his richly commonsense reading of the realities of corporate
power, one is left with the impression that Eccles has been overinfluenced
by his main study companies, conglomerates such as GEC and Grant
Metropolitan, run by tartars such as Lord Weinstock and Lord (Allen)
Sheppard. He might have formed a rather more catholic view if he had
included in his sample more consultative transformational leaders such as
Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters, Donald Petersen of Ford, and
successive bosses of Motorola.
The successes of all three - and also that of the more muscular regime at
British Airways - underline that deep-set, lasting change is a very extended
affair indeed. Except in rare cases, it is only structural and procedural
change that can be accomplished quickly.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (14): A revisionist explanation
 -The British system is now similar, in scale if not yet in ethos, to that
in the rest of Europe and the US / Higher education

'HIGHER EDUCATION AND CORPORATE REALITIES: CLASS, CULTURE AND THE DECLINE OF
GRADUATE CAREERS' by Phillip Brown and Richard Scase UCL Press, Pounds
12.95, 208 pages
Two grand phenomena are examined in this book.
The first has been grindingly reiterated for decades: the decline of big-bad
bureaucracies, whether in the public or private sectors, and the
corresponding rise of 'flexible' organisations, lean and loose-coupled with
flat hierarchies, all but their core activities contracted out or
cost-centred.
According to business gurus and social analysts, we are on the cusp of the
Fordist and post-Fordist ages.
The second, less widely rehearsed phenomenon, is the expansion of higher
education.
During the past 10 years, almost in a fit of absent-mindedness, Britain has
acquired a mass system. With a third of young people, and a growing number
of the not-so-young, going on to universities or colleges, the British
system is now similar, in scale if not yet in ethos, to higher education in
the rest of Europe and the US.
This book, written by two University of Kent sociologists, is an attempt to
relate these two trends.
They offer a revisionist, counter-intuitive explanation.
The standard account stresses cause and effect. Universities and other
higher education institutions have expanded to meet a growing need for
highly skilled labour and, through their research, help build a
technology-based economy.
This was true yesterday. The American land-grant universities - California,
Michigan, Wisconsin and the rest - were established to unlock the (largely
agricultural) wealth of the west in the post-Civil War decades, and our
civic universities founded in the nineteenth century grew, although
obliquely, out of the industrial revolution.
A generation ago, the link between the Robbins-induced expansion of the
universities and Harold Wilson's 'white heat of the technological
revolution' was taken for granted.
It is true today. Much of the recent expansion of students has been in
occupationally relevant subjects such as business studies and the 'softer'
sciences and technologies.
The title of this year's White Paper on science and technology was Realising
Our Potential, and an explicit reference to wealth-creation (along with
improving the quality of life) has been included in the missions of the
reorganised research councils.
It will be true tomorrow. Advanced economies are knowledge-based. Profits
are generated more by the application of ideas than the intensive
exploitation of raw materials or the increasing productivity of labour - or,
rather, the latter are dependent on the former.
In the post-industrial economy, wired into and up by the super-highways of
Information Technology, universities as leading components of the knowledge
industry are key players.
The authors offer a contrary interpretation. They cast doubt on these
supposedly symbiotic links between the development of advanced economies and
the growth of mass higher education systems. They argue that the latter is
far better explained in terms of the accumulation of cultural capital -
socio-economic status as embodied in intellectual manners and academic
qualifications - than of enhanced investment in human capital - the demand
for more sophisticated expert skills and the satisfaction of this demand.
Indeed, they push their revisionism two stages further. First, they argue
that universities, as organisations, and so the careers for which they
prepare their graduates, reflect the old world of planned bureaucracy, both
welfare state and industrial-age.
The professional society of which the former were agents and which was
reflected in the latter is being rapidly eroded.
Second, to the extent that a post-Fordist economy, and the 'flexible'
organisations that are its hallmark, value 'charismatic' and 'transferable'
skills more highly than bureaucratic and technical skills, the effect may be
a regression to older criteria for assessing the comparative worth of higher
education graduates. Self-confidence, 'character' may count for more than
either expertise or experience in the future.
Their conclusions are based on comparatively small-scale surveys of student
attitudes and employer expectations.
The students surveyed were at Oxbridge, a 'Home Counties' university and an
'Inner City' university. The empirical evidence produced by these surveys is
suggestive rather than conclusive, and predictable.
It is not difficult to elicit examples of juvenile arrogance from Oxbridge
students or envious under-confidence from their polytechnic peers. But
whether they can sustain weighty theorising is more doubtful.
Also, the thrust of their conclusions is unclear.
If universities must prepare graduates for 'flexible' careers, the more
enterprising institutions less burdened by donnish baggage should be at an
advantage.
But if new-style 'charisma' is going to be boiled down to old-fashioned
'character', the more traditional universities will benefit.
However, this intriguing book serves to emphasise two key points.
First, mass higher education is a social and cultural phenomenon, although
not perhaps a class phenomenon as the authors suggest.
Expansion has been the result of push from below, not pull from above. Its
primary imperative is the democratic not the skills revolution; its purpose,
more cynically, to preserve social order.
Second, in the (post-?)modern economy where production has yielded pride of
place to consumption and a truly global market has eroded national
differentiation, traditional assumptions about the tight, even causal,
association between modernity - secular, liberal, sceptical and free-market
values - and modernisation, the process of technology-driven wealth
creation, may need to be rethought.
This book is a valuable aid to such re-thinking. Modernity may no longer be
a necessary precondition of modernisation which would leave universities,
synthesisers of both, in an awkward corner.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (13): The latest trendy theories
on test - A one-eyed guru with some hand-me-down psychology can be king /
Management studies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN SEARCH OF MANAGEMENT: CULTURE, CHAOS AND CONTROL IN MANAGERIAL WORK' by
Tony J. Watson, Routledge, Pounds 12.99, 242 pages
Theories such as Tom Peters' 'thriving on chaos' are now so orthodox that
one forgets how recently the revolution in management studies took place.
Henri Fayol's mid-century classic urging would-be managers 'to organise, to
command, to co-ordinate and control' was still widely taught in the late
1970s. What finally undermined Fayol's view was a series of case studies
which substituted the opportunistic empowerer for the rational planner as a
more true-to-life image of management.
It is all to the good, then, that in this new book, Tony Watson, a
management professor at Nottingham Business School, tests the latest trendy
management theories on the factory floor once again - not in a high-powered
company renowned for excellence, but in a 'typical' UK manufacturing
company.
Watson tries to make his corporate guinea-pig anonymous, but it is easy to
identify that 'ZTC Ryland' is GPT (GEC Plessey Telecommunications), the
telecoms equipment manufacturer previously owned 50-50 by 'SEC' (GEC) and
'Parry' (Plessey), and then, after the 1991 takeover of 'Parry', 60-40 by
'SEC' and the European electronics giant 'Siegfried' (Siemens).
Watson spends his year among GPT's middle management shortly after the
GEC-Siemens takeover. At that time, GPT was a weak international player with
an over-reliance upon a single customer, BT, and a single product (Systems X
digital exchanges), which was in decline. Plessey had initiated an expensive
empowerment programme for management but this soon foundered amid fears
about job security under SEC's notorious cost-cutting regime.
Many of the views Watson canvasses support his opinion that the best
managers think strategically about the long-term viability of the business;
get closer to the customer; re-design GPT's over-engineered products; and
re-think the deadline mentality which piles up redundant inventory. Only
one, lone, middle-management voice recommends wide-scale redundancies, a key
factor in GPT's subsequent improvement in productivity.
For all this, though, Watson's book fails. In the half-blind world of
management lore, the one-eyed guru with some hand-me-down psychology and a
well-turned phrase is often king.
If Watson had spent more time examining the new products and new markets
which GPT needed to develop, and less time spouting Marx and Weber in the
works canteen, we would have got a better idea of the longer-term viability
of the business.
In fact, the success of SEC's investment in GPT seems to have surprised even
Lord Weinstock himself, who no longer talks about selling out of the
business as he once did.
Upgrade and replacement work to Systems X in the UK has held up well, new
products have been developed, particularly in payphones and cards, while its
traditional exchange products have found new markets in the emerging world.
The benefits of market size, product transfer and global opportunities which
GEC brought to GPT suggests Watson should have focused his attention far
more upon the senior management culture within the combined GEC-GPT. He
spares the new managing director, only a few months into his job in any
case, barely a half-page interview.
Part of the problem is that Watson's time with the company occurred during a
period of maximum uncertainty about its future. As a postscript to the book,
one wishes Watson could revisit GPT today and see how the improvements have
come about.
He might find that, while middle managers easily empower themselves among
Californian start-ups, in a global telecommunications company a little
rational planning from on high does not come amiss. Shorn of this
perspective, one's impression is that Watson ends up talking to the wrong
people, in the wrong place, at the wrong time.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (12): Big issue revisited - Can
Chicago's South Shore Bank experiment act as a model for inner-city
regeneration / Local investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN WRIGHT

<TEXT>
'COMMUNITY CAPITALISM' By Richard P Taub Harvard Business School Press
Dollars 14.95, 151 pages
One of the more obscure economic indicators is the use of the work
'trickledown'. Beloved of those who believe in the regenerative powers of
large-scale projects - interestingly bridging Margaret Thatcher and Maynard
Keynes - trickledown is currently in hibernation and there is a touching
revival in community and local initiative. However the big issue in local
investment is just that; who invests and is it really investment or is it a
grant?
With the British Government preparing to back a trial local investment
scheme in two areas of the UK, the new edition of Richard Taub's Community
Capitalism is very timely. The book is a history of Chicago's South Shore
Bank and its strapline 'Strategy for Neighbourhood Revitalisation' sums up
the author's ambitions for its scope.
The South Shore Bank is often mentioned as the model for inner city
regeneration both in the US and the UK and increasingly in parts of east and
west Europe where urban decline has become a fact of life. In particular, it
is deemed to show that regeneration can be investment rather than grant or
subsidy-led. Taub is very good at analysing the outline of the successes and
the failures of the Bank since it was 'reborn' in 1973. This was when a
group of four non-traditional bankers took over a fully-operating,
neighbourhood bank - albeit in sharp decline - which as Taub describes it
had deposits of Dollars 38m, a conservative staff, and a reputation for not
being very helpful to the new members of the community. The latter phrase is
crucial. South Shore is a typical urban neighbourhood. An area covering
seven by 12 blocks with a population of 75,000, it is sited on the shores of
Lake Michigan. Originally built to house rail workers, it was a traditional,
middle-class Chicago neighbourhood. Unusually, it contains a wide range of
housing from the mansions of Jackson Park Highlands to tenement blocks.
The transition began after the war, when the lack of repairs in South Shore
combined with the temptation of purpose-built housing in the suburbs to
attract local residents to move out.
South Shore proceeded to go through a period of decline with shops closing,
the old infrastructure being torn down, and crime starting to rise. This in
turn increased the outflow of the old population and left South Shore as a
run-down residential area for poor blacks to move into, 50 per cent of whom
had emigrated from the South.
The four managers, who raised the Dollars 3.2m to buy the South Shore Bank,
had all come into banking from differing backgrounds. Their leader was
Ronald Grzywinski, who had grown up within five miles of South Shore and,
after a career with IBM, had joined a local bank where he operated an urban
development division which built up an impressive track record in backing
minority entrepreneurs.
This experience caused him to look at creating a local banking and
investment body with a strong community focus. The original concept was for
the local residents, in addition to investing, to take an increasing role in
running the operation. After some false starts this led the group to
consider buying an existing body. They purchased the bank with a substantial
loan, backed by personal guarantees, and sought to run it like a
conventional bank while remaining true to their commitment to community
values.
Deposits, which now total well over Dollars 100m, were built up by direct
mail to sympathisers all over the US. This new strength was then used to
invest in local projects and businesses. The new regime established a
formula of lending to local property owners and buyers in which they both
stood to gain, by an upturn both in property values and people's
perceptions. The emphasis switched to responsible and careful development
and extended to Minority Enterprise Lending.
In time the bank's holding company was restructured into four divisions: the
bank; a for-profit real estate development company which renovated property
and sold it on; a Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company
(Mesbic); and the not-for-profit Neighbourhood Institute which was designed
to cope with the effects of change. The bank is now earning profits of more
than 1.5 per cent of assets.
Where the book is tantalising is that it has a new preface written in 1994
but it is still essentially the text of 1987. It is also light on the actual
lending process - the very area which makes South Shore different.
Nonetheless it is particularly relevant for the apprehensive climate of the
nineties and the need to rebuild.

Books on women in management are one of the fastest-growing parts of
business publishing / Female executives

'WOMEN IN MANAGEMENT: A DEVELOPING PRESENCE' edited by Morgan Tanton
Routledge, Pounds 14.99, 253 pages
'COMPETITIVE FRONTIERS: WOMEN MANAGERS IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY' edited by Nancy
J. Adler and Dafna N. Izraeli Blackwell, Pounds 19.99, 414 pages
'MASCULINITY AND THE BRITISH ORGANIZATION MAN SINCE 1945' Michael Roper
Oxford University Press, Pounds 25, 259 pages
There are few women in management. Yet there is no shortage of books about
them. While the number of female executives is low and rising imperceptibly
slowly, the number of academics specialising in the field is climbing
steadily, and books on the theme are one of the fastest-growing parts of
management publishing.
The latest crop has something for everyone - from the down-market self-help
books of the 'Dress for Success' variety, to serious academic research. Even
the latter type shows impressive range, from heavy duty feminist rant to
painstaking factual account.
Women in Management, a collection of mainly British research, claims to
represent a 'second generation' of gender studies, and is presented from
what it calls a 'woman-centred perspective'. Editor Morgan Tanton defines
this as follows: 'Instead of highlighting how women are different from men I
have described how women are. I have omitted reference to men or, where this
was unavoidable, I have endeavoured to refer to men as 'other' to the female
norm'.
Such a warning is going to put off a lot of people, (women among them) who
baulk at the idea of any such special perspective. These readers will find
plenty else to offend them in this volume. The token alternative male among
the contributors talks about a revelation that came to him during a
management training session that he was giving.
He realised that his preoccupations as a white male were geared towards
mastering death, whereas those of the black woman who took part in the
session seemed to be more about being at one with the mysteries of life. At
least his account was not followed by three pages of detailed footnotes
quoting other work in the area, as were those of his fellow contributors.
For all its unattractive packaging the collection is not without interest.
One chapter offers a convincing account of the ways in which the supposedly
scientific systems used by companies for appraising their employees may
discriminate against women. Another looks at the differences between male
and female entrepreneurs.
There is a minimum of ideological baggage carried by Competitive Frontiers:
Women Managers in A Global Economy. Instead of concentrating on Britain and
America, whose glass ceilings have already been scrutinised from every
conceivable angle, this collection brings us women managers from all over
the world. The conclusion of the book - that women seem to be struggling to
a more or lesser degree on all continents - is not going to surprise anyone.
The value of the book lies in the bulk of information - presented in a
clear, factual style - about women in countries that for the most part have
escaped detailed examination.
A clear introduction by Nancy Adler summarises in a few pages the last 25
years of research into the barriers facing women managers, and divides the
findings into four categories.
The first are based upon the differences between men and women themselves.
The second take as their focus the organisation, and look at the ways in
which women's under-representation in management can be self perpetuating.
The third involve straightforward discrimination: deeply embedded
assumptions by managers about the role of women. The fourth claim that
male-dominated institutions persist because the people with a vested
interest in their persistance are the ones with the necessary power to make
sure change does not happen.
An interesting new light is cast on the subject by Michael Roper who has
looked at the same subject taking men as his starting point. In Masculinity
and the British Organization Man since 1945 he has interviewed male
corporate veterans and concluded that the idea of male managers as strictly
rational beings is a myth. He has tried to get under the skin of
organisation men by asking them about their relationships with each other,
their wives, their secretaries and their women colleagues.
This is by the the most enjoyable read of the bunch. Each of his subjects is
given a good deal of rope, and nearly all manage to hang themselves with it.
A Mr Dowell, chairman of Hill Components, a traditional engineering company,
starts - as do all the others - by playing lip service to the idea of
promoting women. He then relates the following experience:
'We had a woman engineer who was in charge of all our computer operations
who was extremely good, but eventually became unemployable because. . . she
became more male than the males in her job. She was so aggressive and so
difficult that in the end you couldn't hold a balanced, reasoned argument
with her, because if you said anything that implied criticism of her because
she was a woman, you got the woman bit. So that in the end we had to call it
a day.'
Roper concludes that some aspects of the classic macho manager are under
threat as a result of new technology, restructuring of companies and so.
Whether his demise will bring with it an era of equality is another matter
altogether.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Few better qualified -
What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth / Sam
Walton's American dream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance
and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages
Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream;
few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.
Walton is a character it would be difficult to invent, an all-American boy
who became one of the world's most successful businessmen. The church-going
son of a farmer born in 1918 near Kingfisher, Oklahoma, he founded a store
chain which made him America's richest man, and which, shortly before his
death in 1992, became the world's biggest retailer.
His company, Wal-Mart, made sales of Dollars 55bn last year, and after
Walton's death Fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children
held between them the second-largest fortune in the world - Dollars 23.5bn.
What is most startling about Wal-Mart is the speed of its growth. Although
Walton built up a small chain of Ben Franklin variety store franchises from
1945, it was not until 1962 that he opened his first Wal-Mart discount
store.
At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with
sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount
Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers. Ten years
later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest
retailer in the US. Its turnover was only 9 per cent of that of Sears
Roebuck, the biggest, and 11 per cent of K mart, the second-biggest. Within
another 10 years, Wal-Mart had overtaken them both.
Apart from Walton's autobiography completed shortly before his death,
however, published material about the company is curiously scarce. This book
attempts to fill the gap, to provide a 'scholarly account' of the rise of
Wal-Mart, setting it in the wider context of US retailing, and explaining
how it was achieved.
One strength the authors identify is Wal-Mart's ability to copy and adapt
from other retailers.
Sam Walton did not invent discount retailing. Rather, he realised the threat
discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth
many of the US's leading discounters of the early 1960s, including Ann and
Hope, E J Korvette, Spartan's, Fed-Mart, and K mart.
Walton learned from them all, but was unique in taking his discount stores
into small towns of a few thousand people, where shoppers used to travelling
long distances were delighted to have a cut-price store nearby selling
everything they needed.
Another strength is Wal-Mart's openness to technology. As early as the
1950s, Walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a
small aircraft to pilot between stores himself - something he continued to
do to the end of his life.
Sometimes, Walton was more reluctant to invest in technology, and had to be
persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers, and scanning at check-outs -
long before most retailers had recognised their importance - and to invest
Dollars 20m in an internal satellite communications system. This technology
helped Wal-Mart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any
retailer. But perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success, the book
suggests, has been Wal-Mart's streamlined and highly responsive management
structure.
Regional vice-presidents based at group headquarters in Bentonville,
Arkansas, rather than in costly regional offices, are despatched every
Monday by aircraft to their regions, spend the week visiting stores, working
with staff and managers, and return for a day-long merchandising meeting
every Friday.
They discuss results, problems and suggestions from the week at a 7.30am
meeting on Saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to
relate the results. District managers hold a conference call with their
store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have
been communicated to all store department heads.
The system means employees can make suggestions to vice-presidents one week
and, if the idea is accepted by the Saturday meeting, see its implementation
begin the following week.
Even the world's most successful retailer makes mistakes, however. One was
Walton's decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executive's role
in 1974 in favour of Ronald Mayer, only to return to both roles in 1976
after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins. Another was
Wal-Mart's short-lived Hypermart format, which proved too big even for
gigantist America.
Then there was Walton's rash promise to do a 'hula dance' on Wall Street if
Wal-Mart achieved an 8 per cent pre-tax profit margin in 1984. It did, and
he did.
The book also covers well the debate over whether Wal-Mart's impact on the
economies of small US towns was positive or negative.
If there are criticisms, these are that this 'scholarly account' never quite
captures the sheer excitement of working in the world's fastest-growing
retailer. Moreover, it makes little attempt to predict whether Wal-Mart can
continue its growth, and conquer the rest of the world in the way it
conquered the US.
But this is a well-researched and accessible account of one man's success in
building his own American dream.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (9): High on the agenda - Not
many employers are willing to implement strategic partnerships with trade
unions / Employee relations and workplace reform

'THE MUTUAL GAINS ENTERPRISE' by Thomas Kochan and Paul Osterman, Harvard
Business School Press, Dollars 27.95, 272 pages
'RESTORING THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LABOR LAW' edited by Sheldon Friedman,
Richard Hurd, Rudolph Oswald and Ronald Seeber, ILR Press Ithaca, New York.
Dollars 29.95 366 pages
Workplace reform is high on the American labour policy agenda as companies
adapt to the competitive pressures imposed by the global economy. But
whether this will lead to a transformation in corporate America's mainly
adversarial attitude to employee relations must remain doubtful.
Trade unions are now an endangered species. Collective bargaining covers
hardly more than 12 per cent of private sector workers. Organised labour's
influence is minimal on Capitol Hill, as recent decisive defeats indicated
over the North American Free Trade Agreement and the successful Senate
filibuster against legislation making it illegal for companies to hire
replacement workers in strikes. Ten years ago enlightened union leaders
believed human resource management would provide them with a lifeline
because companies would see it was in their competitive advantage to create
more consensual workplaces based on agreements with recognised trade unions.
But these two important and well-written books on the contemporary American
workplace suggest not many employers are willing to introduce strategic
partnerships with trade unions into their own businesses. 'The leading
firms, managers and union leaders that advocate innovative human resource
practices have become islands of innovation in a sea of traditional
practices', lament Professor Tom Kochan and his MIT colleagues.
They believe mere verbal exhortation in favour of 'good' labour practices is
not going to change deep-seated employer attitudes. In their opinion, the
federal government must stimulate more management-labour co-operation,
through what they call the creation of 'a mutual gains coalition'. This
means - they insist - providing a new role for government as 'mediator,
facilitator and enabler of workplace change'.
'The momentum that has built up in the private sector requires government to
become a partner in encouraging investment in human resources and diffusing
the knowledge and innovative practices throughout the American workplace',
argue Kochan and co. No doubt President Clinton's enlightened labour
secretary Robert Reich, a former MIT colleague himself, would agree with
that sentiment but it seems most unlikely it will lead to positive results.
Professor Kochan and his co-authors have produced a sensible, thoughtful and
what ought to be an influential contribution to the public policy debate on
worker representation. The trouble is there are simply not enough companies
willing to listen and act on their conciliatory message.
An important reason for this indifference - they acknowledge - lies in what
they call the 'organisational governance' of the American company. In
Germany and Japan private corporations think and act with their long-term
interests in mind but in the US maximising business performance for the
immediate needs of the shareholders is the primary concern and workplace
change has a low priority to them.
The book calls for 'a new conception of the American corporation' which
would ally shareholder and employee interests more closely together and
building institutions to bring human resource policies into the core of
corporate strategy. The formidable obstacles to American workplace reform
are also well described in the collection of essays from Cornell
University's ILR Press, a fruitful joint product of academia and the AFL-CIO
union federation.
The book asserts bluntly that US workers 'should not be denied the freedom
to associate, to form and join organisations under their own control and of
their own choosing, any more than African-Americans or other minorities
should be denied their civil rights or women equal rights'. And yet this is
what is happening in contemporary America. Apparently it is the 'escalating
use of aggressive union-avoidance tactics' by employers, not any lack of
interest by workers in joining a trade union, that lies at the heart of the
problem. 'A climate of fear now stands in the way of a revival of American
labor unionism', the Cornell study asserts.
The Cornell essays provide a persuasive - sometimes eloquent - argument in
favour of trade unionism as a protection for vulnerable workers in the
labour market - especially women and African-Americans. But many companies
regard trade unions as subversive institutions. This attitude is not new in
US history. Indeed, except for the period between the passage of the 1935
National Labor Relations Act during the New Deal and the early 1960s,
American unions have never found it easy to organise in the face of hostile
employers.
Moreover, as Dorothy Sue Cobble argues in a particularly insightful essay,
the traditional industrial relations system was 'designed for a
mass-production industrial workplace' not today's 'service-dominated,
computer-based global economy'.
As a result, she argues, industrial unionism needs to be replaced by what
she calls 'occupational' unionism, a return to a system that caters for the
needs of workers and employers outside mass production processes as happened
in the US before the 1930s. However, for the vast majority of American
workers non-unionism will remain the dominant fact in the workplace with
little sign that most companies are willing to experiment with other forms
of worker representation as an alternative to trade unionism.
Negotiated workplace change might seem rational commonsense that pays off in
a company's bottom line but a majority of American employers do not believe
this to be self-evident. These books may point the way forward but alas
those who would most benefit from them are the least likely to read them.

policies

'FORGING INDUSTRIAL POLICY:  THE US, BRITAIN AND FRANCE IN THE RAILWAY AGE'
By Frank Dobbin Cambridge University Press, Pounds 30, 262 pages
After decades of neglect the railways are once again at the centre of policy
debate in many countries. The privatisation and dismantling of
publicly-owned, centralised rail networks in Europe is leading to a shake-up
of established patterns of operation.
Frank Dobbin's choice of the 19th century railroad industry as the model for
his study of how countries devise their industrial policies is therefore
timely. His examples throw up many fascinating parallels with present-day
thinking on the railways and industry in general although few are explicitly
developed under the historical approach adopted by the author.
Seen against the background of the British parliament's response to the
railroad mania of the 1840s, the present government's much-criticised plans
for a privatised railway network emerge with an impeccable pedigree.
Parliament in the middle of the 19th century left it to private enterprise
to define the public good.
Towards the end of the last century though, as critics of the present
privatisation mania will no doubt point out, these policies had to be
modified. Government intervention became necessary when parliament perceived
that individual property rights - of expropriated landowners  - were under
threat; that passenger safety was at risk and that poorer customers required
protection from the fare policies of greedy railway companies.
But Dobbin, an assistant professor of sociology at Princeton University, has
a far broader canvas. His purpose is to show that the industrial and
economic policies of nations do not conform to a single economic imperative
but reflect the cultures and early industrial experiences from which they
spring.
The railways suit because they were a leading industry which has left
subsequent researchers with a mass of documentary evidence. They were also
one of the earliest sectors which required governments to design a framework
of industrial policies and set a pattern for the treatment of other
industries.
National policies reflect a country's political culture, Dobbin asserts. The
US, Britain and France applied to industrial policy the principles which
they had adopted for their political institutions.
Distrustful of the powers of a strong centralised state, the
newly-independent American colonists determined to vest power in the
individual communities and states while restraining the powers of central
government.
But this approach had to be modified when local and state schemes to promote
railroad construction led to frauds and scandals. The result was the
creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission to impose federal regulation
and prevent anti-competitive practices. The federal government was still
kept at a distance but an anti-trust framework was put in place to ensure
fair play and maximum economic advantage.
If the Americans turned the state into the referee of the free market, the
French, in contrast, saw the state as the conductor of the industrial
orchestra.
They regarded a centralised, professional state bureaucracy as necessary for
public order. So when it came to designing a railway network it was only
natural for the state and its technical experts to decide routes and
systems. To allow competing private entrepreneurs to have their way would
have wasted resources and posed a threat to good political and economic
order.
The British approach, while superficially similar to that adopted by the
Americans in its reliance on private enterprise, was different in important
respects, Dobbin argues. After initially taking a completely laisser faire
stance, parliament was forced to intervene to protect, not the market, on
the American model, but the individual entrepreneur.
By the end of the 19th century, policies were designed to shield the
entrepreneurial small company from the vagaries of politics and the market.
Ultimately this led to British industrial policies, including subsidies,
production quotas and price fixing, which did much to contribute to the
country's industrial decline.
But whatever may have happened in more recent times, in the 19th century, at
least, the three different national approaches to railways policy all had
the effect of producing 'rapid, dependable and cost-effective transport
systems in relatively short order. No strategy failed in any important
sense.'
Observers of the business scene might disagree with Dobbin's assertion that
the British treat their small companies better than their continental
European rivals, although this may be a more recent development. They might
also take issue with the view that subsidy and protection are peculiarly
British phenomena.
Some readers might feel that the author's failure to take into account the
radical changes in economic policies which have shaken up the UK and the
other economies of Europe in the past 15 years represent the book's main
weakness.
But equally irritating is the turgid, jargon-packed style of the opening and
closing sections where he elaborates his theories. Some readers may be
deterred from turning to the country studies which make up the more easily
accessible core of the book.

'CRIME WITHOUT FRONTIERS' By Claire Sterling Little Brown Pounds 18.99, 274
pages
Everyone has heard of the growth of crime in eastern Europe since the demise
of communism. Terms such as the 'Wild East' and 'Mafioski' punctuate
newspaper reports of flourishing black markets and a profiteering old guard.
It is an image of chaos.
Most reactions are dismissive: this is the difficult transitional period
leading to unfettered capital markets and private enterprise. Now that
Russia is the west's friend, it is the end of history, a phrase coined in
1990 which still has currency today. Three years later, the end of history
is beginning to look decidely ugly, but it is organised, not chaotic. A
prostrate country lies open to the international underworld, which sets
about constructing the world's biggest criminal safehouse.
Crime syndicates have bought up Russia's governing class, looted its natural
resources, manipulated its currency and infiltrated every sector of its
economy. Russia has become a giant washing machine swapping narcodollars for
roubles, a toll gate for Europe's drug trade.
Crime Without Frontiers is the story of how western and eastern criminal
syndicates secured the former Soviet safehouse, the last piece in
constructing a global pax mafiosa. The safehouse is the size of Europe and
America combined, a 'point de rencontre' from which to carve the planet into
orderly spheres of corruption.
In the pax mafiosa, business is business - the Chinese Triads are partners
in crime with the American Mafia; the Italians use the Russians to launder
for the Colombian cartels, the Japanese Yakuza work hand in hand with the
Italians. Crime has come full circle.
Sterling works on an underlying paradox. Where there was once legitimate
East-West distrust, there is now criminal detente. On one hand are 'sensible
crooks' working in dishonest harmony, on the other is lawful society
'haggling over legal jurisdiction and perpetuating a multitude of police
agencies carefully keeping secrets from each other'.
The use of Germany as a criminal transit point between east and west is the
book's most startling case in point, a paradigm of the European Union's
vulnerability to the forces of enterprise crime.
The legitimate world is ripe for the taking. Germany is a victim of its own
punctilious laws of privacy and data protection: phone taps and bugging are
outlawed, there is no cross-fertilisation between law enforcement agencies
and anti-money laundering legislation is effectively unworkable. And the EU
itself? Sterling describes it as 'an epic joke' where crime fighting is
concerned. The borders have been removed for crooks, but not for the cops.
No two countries have the same drug laws or surveillance of pushers. There
is no pooling of police information and no common extradition policy. The EU
cannot even agree on harmonising police radio frequencies.
In this environment, criminals choose the best countries to ship, store,
market and launder their produce.
Sterling's book is nothing short of remarkable in its intuitive knowledge of
the workings of a new underworld order only glimpsed by the media. It
explains the horrifying flipside to the freedom of movement so cherished
since the almost concurrent fall of communism and the dismantling of
Europe's internal barriers.
Unfortunately, few have listened carefully to this flipside. Sterling says
that by the time the Western powers-that-be listen hard enough, they may
already have become the powers-that-were. They will be dealing with an
international shadow government the likes of which has never been seen or
imagined.

'THE MAKING OF HARCOURT GENERAL' by Bettye H Pruitt Harvard Business School
Press, Dollars 35.00, 310 pages
If chapter headings such as 'Professionalisation of the Entrepreneurial
Enterprise' and 'Diversification' set your pulse racing, this book is for
you. If not, put it down quickly and move on.
Ms Pruitt is a peculiar breed of writer. She refers in her preface to 'those
of us who practice history as consultants in the corporate world.' She is a
vice-president of a company which 'specialises in the historical analysis of
institutional development.' Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then,
that her tale sinks under a morass of consultant-speak.
Harcourt General has been a curious example of the US conglomerate. Since
starting out in 1922 in the movie theatre business - it was known for most
of its life as General Cinema - the company has been dominated by just two
members of the Smith family; father Philip and son Richard. It still retains
echoes of the family business (the Smiths retain a veto over any takeover of
the group.)
Under Richard, the company bought its way into soft drink bottling,
retailing - through Neiman Marcus - and eventually publishing. It bought
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1991 when that company was still reeling from
the financial consequences of fighting off advances from the late Robert
Maxwell. Like all modern conglomerates, it has unbundled itself again,
shedding bottling, cinemas and insurance. Yet only in its final pages does
this story come briefly to life. There, we glimpse for the first time the
tensions between family shareholders and the professional managers who now
largely run the group. The 1991 acquisition of Harcourt itself is a
fascinating story of financial manoeuvring.
Until this point, though, The Making of Harcourt General has been a tedious
recounting of events, with little sense of the personal or corporate
dynamics behind the company's growth. The characters are mere ciphers.
We are told that 'it would be difficult to find a flaw' in the character of
Philip Smith who founded and ran the company until his death in 1961. He was
apparently 'both brilliant and charismatic, yet never self-aggrandising or
overbearing.' Was there ever such a paragon of business virtue? Son Richard
also remains a mystery, although that may be because he is not a natural
subject for a book like this. Writing in 1987, Fortune magazine described
him as a 'strait-laced New Englander' who 'loathes publicity.'
While the lack of rounded human characters robs the book of interest for the
general reader, fans of corporate history are also likely to find it
disappointing. There is little analysis of General Cinema's financial
strategy.
Reading between the lines of Ms Pruitt's account, you just glimpse the
outline of big and clashing egos, and the hint of some almighty
disagreements and internal feuds along the way. This might have made
interesting reading. Unfortunately, the author skips over these real-life
tensions with the ease of a management consultant doctoring a contentious
report.

'PROPERTY TO THE PEOPLE' by Lynn D. Nelson and Irina Y. Kuzes M. E. Sharpe
Dollars 19.95, 267 pages
Russia has changed so rapidly during the past three years that it is
difficult to understand just how it happened. The country's evolution - from
a socialist, centrally-controlled economy toward a capitalist, privatised
one - has been moulded by the volatile political fortunes of Russia's
leading politicians and economists.
The most tangible result of economic reform - the privatisation of Russia's
shops, factories and agricultural land - was by no means pre-ordained. So it
is most welcome to all students of Russian political economy that Professor
Lynn Nelson, of Virginia Commonwealth University, and Russian urban planner
Irina Kuzes have published a study of what is clearly the first chapter of
the Russian privatisation story.
The book, which covers the period from October 1991 through the Yeltsin
referendum in April 1993, offers an account of the privatisation process,
with particular emphasis on the political background to key economic events.
The authors base their analysis on interviews with the architects of Russian
privatisation, Anatoly Chubais and Dmitri Vasiliev, on Russian news
coverage, opinion polls, and on their own survey of decision makers in four
Russian cities: Moscow, Ekaterinberg, Voronezh and Smolensk.
What the authors do best is to unravel the economic strategies and political
motives of those who have been involved in Russian economic reform. The
period prior to the attempted putsch in August 1991 was characterised by a
struggle for power; Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, Grigory Yavlinsky,
Stanislav Shatalin, Abel Aganbejian, and Yegor Gaidar all vied for the right
to steer Russia's economic course. The book helps to explain their different
approaches, and to analyse why certain proposals were never implemented. The
book also documents the extent to which Mr Yeltsin's popularity has been
tied to economic performance, and how he has personally intervened in every
major economic decision.
The fascinating fourth chapter of the book sheds new light on the events
that led up to the creation of the State Property Management Committee (GKI)
and its privatisation programme. For example, in the controversy surrounding
the use of cash-redeemable vouchers, the authors state that Yavlinsky had
argued against vouchers, predicting that they would either lose value or
fuel inflation. However Mr Yeltsin saw vouchers as a way to divide state
property among millions of people; hence the political objectives of the
voucher idea came to override the potential economic drawbacks.
Regarding Mr Gaidar's fall from power in December 1992, the authors cite a
mismatch between Mr Gaidar's upbeat economic predictions and the
deteriorating economy. And the authors document how inflation became the
pivotal issue in the power struggle between reformers and conservatives.
The book covers the nitty-gritty details of the privatisation law,
describing the auction process, the role of local privatisation commissions,
and the voucher distribution system. What is new is the perspective of those
on the receiving end of privatisation - gleaned from the authors' survey of
decision-makers in four Russian cities.
Responses to the questionnaire, which includes measures of job satisfaction,
decision-making authority, and attitude to privatisation, are woven into the
text and also recorded in the appendix. The analysis shows that in 1992, an
overwhelming majority of people supported the idea of privatisation,
although fewer supported the government's methods of implementing it.
One hesitates to criticise a book which is one of the very first studies of
Russia's remarkable privatisation drive. Nevertheless, the book suffers from
the fact that neither Nelson nor Kuzes are economists.
For example, the authors are dismissive of GKI Deputy Minister Vasiliev's
defence of the price liberalisation in October 1991, reporting that acute
food shortages occurred three months after the price liberalisation was put
in place.
They imply that price liberalisation caused the food shortages. Although
some economists have linked these two events, the subject is controversial
and complex, with factors such as contracting gross domestic product, a
complete breakdown in storage and distribution, and falling productivity all
contributing to the shortages.
Overall, however, this book is highly recommended reading for anyone who has
watched the Russian economy during this period. With the second phase of
privatisation now under way in Russia - covering divisive issues such as
land and health care - the authors' second volume will be eagerly awaited.

'OPENING JAPAN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS' By J. Robert Brown Jr. Routledge, Pounds
45, 272 pages
'THE MIT ENCYCLOPEIDA OF THE JAPANESE ECONOMY' By Robert C Hsu The MIT
Press, Pounds 39.95, 432 pages
'SELLING INTO JAPAN' By Sadahiko Nakamura International Venture Handbooks,
Pounds 14.99, 249 pages
The Japanese began systematic preparations to penetrate the western
economies about 130 years ago.
Serious, large-scale efforts to reverse the process date only from the rise
of the Japanese trade surplus in the early 1980s.
Given the linguistic, psychological, institutional and other barriers
between the parties, it is not surprising that the balance of economic
advantage in recent years has seemed to be so much in Japan's favour.
Furthermore, although the west is beginning to catch up, at least in
consciousness of the problem, the problem itself gets more difficult.
For whereas the main challenge used to be how to penetrate the markets for
goods, there is now increasing concern with the markets for services and
with the obstacles to making a success of direct investment in Japan.
J. Robert Brown's book is one of the most interesting accounts of these
subjects yet to appear. Based on careful study of the literature and on more
than 100 detailed interviews, it throws new light not only on the banking
sector, but on the wider issue of how public and private sectors can
interact in the process of market opening.
A small number of western banks had established themselves in Japan before
the Pacific War, including the old British Far Eastern banks, and Citibank,
representing America.
These mainly supported foreign trade and the banking needs of foreign
companies in Japan.
In the case of Citibank, at least, care was taken not to compete with
domestic banks, on whom it relied for advice on local creditworthiness.
During the post-war occupation, foreign banks had a new opportunity to
re-enter the market and three prominent American Banks did so.
Again, however, the foreigners were sidelined rather than integrated into
the mainstream of the financial system, focusing on trade finance and short-
to medium-term dollar lending.
After the occupation, the Japanese government and the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) resumed control.
No new foreign entrants were allowed in for many years and a highly
regulated financial system was established.
In this system, Japanese institutions were assigned designated, highly
specialised roles and the volume, direction and price of credit flows were
each tightly controlled by an MOF with enormous legal and discretionary
authority.
The only way in which foreigners could be fitted into the picture was to
restrict them to specific classes of business, such as foreign exchange,
trade and dollar lending.
Foreign banks acquiesced in these arrangements through much of the 1960s and
early 1970s partly because their niches were exceptionally profitable.
So much so, that in the early 1960s Citibank's profits from only four
branches were larger than those of Fuji Bank, the largest of the Japanese
City Banks.
The other reason for acquiescence was that in the Japanese system, since
banks rather than security markets were the main source of industrial
finance, they were called upon to provide what was in reality a form of
risk-sharing, equity finance, and were also expected by the authorities to
provide both leadership and, when necessary, bail-outs for large companies.
At the time, western bankers, with their short term, balance sheet approach
to lending, found these practices unacceptable and hence were unwilling to
undertake a lead role in company lending, even had they been encouraged to
do so.
All this began to collapse after the oil shock of the 1970s and the rise of
US-Japan trade frictions in the 1980s.
What Brown brings out so clearly is that liberalisation and market opening
occurred because it was in the interests of both the western banks and the
Japanese City Banks.
Both sides wanted new instruments and avenues to funds and both wanted
abolition of the old division between banking and securities business.
The government had ultimately to agree to change, and all that this
entailed, because of its need for large-scale bond financing to cover its
budgetary deficit.
Brown also shows that, although driven by these underlying factors, the
occasion of the big breakthrough was the Reagan-Nakasone summit of 1983,
when an embarrassing absence of business allowed the Americans to put the
financial services issue on an unexpectedly high-level agenda.
In spite of all the change and the formal steps towards liberalisation that
have taken place, the longer term results remain disappointing.
On the positive side, examples such as Citibank have shown that by taking a
long view and making a careful analysis of the market, by a shrewd
combination of conformity and innovation, and by good training and personnel
policies, it is possible to make a success of business in Japan.
On the other hand, the overall profitability and market shares of western
banks as a group, remain very low. A fundamental reason for this is that
there remain strong traditional elements in both the relationships between
the financial system and the MOF, and between the institutions and their
customers.
Whether the political economy of the post-'Bubble' era will change this, or
whether western companies will adapt even more flexibly to Japanese ways,
remain fascinating questions for the future.
The books by Robert C. Hsu and Sadahiko Nakamura are both useful aids for
those wishing to understand the Japanese economy and markets.
Hsu's Encyclopedia is a comprehensive mixture of short factual entries and
substantive articles on subjects such as taxation, finance and foreign
trade.
Testing it against against Brown, however, I found the Encyclopedia helpful
on gensaki transactions, but without guidance on hari kiri swaps.
Also, although very up to date on matters such as politics (summer 1993);
its statistical data are restricted to 1990 and 1991, which is rather dated
by modern publishing standards.
Nakamura has very different types of information, mostly of a practical
nature. This includes lots of detail on individual product markets, trade
fairs, distribution networks and dozens of useful addresses.
The problem with Nakamura (and to a lesser extent Hsu), is that they will
date very quickly.
For much of this kind of information the future has to be electronic.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (2): Serious flights of fancy -
Airport bookshops are increasingly paying attention to the needs - and
aspirations - of the business traveller / Airport books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In all those aircraft disaster movies, where the entire crew eats poisoned
scampi, or Concorde gets attacked by a runaway Soviet missile, there is a
stock of characters among the passengers helping to give dramatic resonance
to what is usually a tiring plot: the irascible old lady who preferred to
travel by train anyway; the ailing child; the hot-tempered husband who has
rowed with his wife and wonders guiltily if he will ever see her again.
No such film could appear today without another ubiquitous fixture of the
passenger lounge; the self-improving business traveller. Many managers are
so weighed down with work-loads that an uninterrupted couple of hours on a
flight to a conference destination might be the only time they get to
themselves - and they make sure they put it to good use.
Spurning the chance to catch up on the Booker short-list, or finally make a
start on War and Peace, they prefer instead to devote some precious time to
books which promise, quite simply, to make them better at their jobs.
The proof of these flights of fancy is on the ground, where airport
bookshops are increasingly paying attention to the needs - and aspirations -
of the business traveller. Sales of business books are as yet fairly modest
 -some 6 per cent of total sales in W. H. Smith's 45 airport shops - but the
displays of such material are fast acquiring the slick professionalism which
the rest of the publishing world has long taken for granted.
At the main W. H. Smith bookstore at London's Heathrow airport, business
books are tucked between transport and military history and poetry. While it
is hard for them to compete with some of the more lurid paperback
best-sellers, they are having a go: titles such as Maverick], Japanese
Maverick], Who Dares Sells, and Awaken the Giant Within are not packaged
noticeably differently from the spies-and-sex potboilers which dominate
airport bookshops. It is no surprise that there is such a happy convergence
of interests between airports, publishers and business travellers. Ms Sam
Brown, airports book buyer at W. H. Smith, says business books are one of
publishing's greatest expansion areas.
'A very high percentage of airport users are business travellers, they are
not price-sensitive and they have time on their hands,' she says. According
to figures compiled by the British Airports Authority, 5.5 per cent of all
book sales in the UK are from airport shops.
'It is not uncommon for a business manager, particularly a foreign one, to
browse through the shop and put a mass order in once he or she arrives at
the other end,' says Ms Brown. High-profile biographies, company histories
and a whole range of pocket-books and manuals figure well in their sales -
as does the new breed of quasi-philosophical tracts from authors such as Tom
Peters and Charles Handy.
Topping the airport business charts in recent months has been George Soros's
The Alchemy of Finance, published by John Wiley. Mr Mike Crayford, the
company's marketing executive responsible for airports, says it is no
coincidence that the book is written by someone who is famous for having
made a lot of money. 'It has sold extremely well - I guess business people
think that reading it will make them lots of money. You could call it a kind
of greed factor.'
He says that many of the buyers at airport bookshops would not normally have
the time or, possibly, the inclination to spend hours browsing in an
'ordinary' shop. 'In an airport, they are 'captured' on-site, with time to
spare - it is an ideal selling scenario.' What seems curious is that, rather
than take a couple of hours 'off' by sinking into a novel, today's business
traveller is using every minute of his or her time for self-improvement.
Or perhaps it is not so curious. Many of today's business books, heavily
influenced by the self-help publishing boom, are written in the most racy,
aphoristic language this side of Nietzsche. One of their most common - and
popular - refrains concerns the need to clear away all one's paperwork,
troubles and old-fashioned ideas and re-invent oneself from scratch.
Such books cannot be read in the correct spirit when sitting in front of a
heaving desk with a stream of appointments to keep. But once off the ground,
can there be a better way of rejuvenating the mind than dreaming about
becoming another Soros, or revelling in the freedom of 'liberation
management', or re-styling oneself as a maverick, bucking the conformity
which dominates one's working life?
It could be that some of the most important decisions one ever has to face
are best taken high above the ground, with a complimentary drink and a good
book in tow.

FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (1): Dispassionate review of the
evidence - This book deserves a much wider audience than the university
students for whom it is primarily intended / British economic history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'THE ECONOMIC HISTORY OF BRITAIN SINCE 1700' Edited by Roderick Flood and
Donald McCloskey Cambridge University Press Pounds 50, Volume 1, 1700-1860:
484 pages, Volume 2, 1860-1939:  510 pages, Volume 3, 1939-1992: 427 pages
For the past 30 years, discussion about Britain's economic performance has
been dominated by a sense of national failure.
How could a country which once astonished the world with its industrial
achievements have sunk so low? Some blame the legacy of the industrial
revolution and the failure to adapt to German and American competition in
the late 19th century. Others put more weight on inter-war protection and
cartelisation, or on misplaced priorities after 1945, when resources which
should have been devoted to industrial modernisation were spent on the
welfare state.
That there should be competing explanations is not surprising; the past two
centuries of British economic history contain plenty of unresolved
controversies and puzzles. But even if complete agreement among historians
is unlikely, it should be possible to remove at least some of the
misconceptions which pervade so much of the debate about British economic
decline.
That is why the second edition of The Economic History of Britain since
1700, edited by Floud and McCloskey, deserves a much wider audience than the
university students for whom it is primarily intended.
Substantially revised from the 1981 version and with the addition of a third
volume which extends the story to 1992, the book brings together in an
accessible way the work of 39 scholars on a range of topics which includes
population trends and living standards, the growth of cities and the
economics of the Empire.
The third volume is inevitably less authoritative than the first two, but
the book as a whole provides a dispassionate review of the evidence and a
welcome readiness to put British experience in an international context. The
starting point is the period leading up to the industrial revolution when
Britain, more than any other nation, provided the incentives and
institutional support which were necessary for sustained technological
innovation.
As Joel Mokyr writes: 'Ancient prejudices, which regarded intellectual
efforts devoted to production as something unfit for decent gentlemen,
though not quite dead, no longer dominated British society. It was becoming
socially acceptable to make money from industry, and therefore from
innovation'.
Britain's strength was not so much in basic inventions, a large number of
which originated in France, as in incremental improvement based largely on
mechanical intuition and dexterity. Whereas French science was theoretical
and abstract, the British approach was empirical, experimental and
pragmatic.
Did the emphasis on inspired tinkering contain the seeds of subsequent
failure in industries which called for formal scientific and technical
education? This is part of the wider issue of Britain's alleged
over-commitment to the products of the first industrial revolution -
textiles, iron, coal - and its lag in the newer activities such as
electrical engineering and chemicals which came to the fore towards the end
of the 19th century.
But, as Knick Harley explains, Britain had a comparative advantage in these
older products until well into the 20th century and close trading links with
countries, chiefly outside Europe and the US, which had the largest demand
for them. With Germany and the US protecting the new industries by tariffs
and government support, Britain's pattern of trade and industrial
specialisation before 1914 was a rational response to market circumstances.
One of the consequences may have been a neglect, relative to Germany and the
US, of the investment in human capital which the new industries required.
But this hardly justifies the view that between 1870 and 1914 there was an
entrepreneurial and organisational failure from which the economy never
recovered.
As Sidney Pollard shows, there were successes and failures during this
period, but no general industrial decline. 'The entrepreneurs who had got to
the top in late Victorian and Edwardian Britain could hold their own with
the very best abroad'.
Even in education, Pollard argues, substantial progress was made, including
the creation of civic universities in Leeds, Sheffield and other cities.
Admiration for the formal, state-directed German system 'overlooked the
merits of the British voluntary and demand-led education, with its largely
practical emphasis'. A more serious legacy of the industrial revolution may
have been the system of employment relations whereby, as William Lazonick
puts it, employers delegated control of the manufacturing process to skilled
craftsmen.
'The authority and responsibility to manage the shop floor organisation of
work provided in turn a basis for key groups of workers to form powerful
trade unions that, through collective bargaining over the conditions of work
and pay, consolidated craft control'.
Employers, in effect, gave up the right to manage.
That Britain's labour relations arrangements became a competitive handicap
in some industries is not in doubt; more questionable is Lazonick's
assertion that the 'root cause' of the country's inferior performance was
the unwillingness of entrepreneurs to invest in 'modern managerial
structures that could plan and co-ordinate shop floor work'.
The failure before 1914 to build US-style managerial hierarchies was not
unique to Britain and not necessarily a long-term source of weakness.
Was it, then, the inter-war period that put in place, as Barry Eichengreen
suggests, 'the shackles that prevented the British economy from keeping pace
with its European competitors'?
The first world war violently disrupted the structure of world trade and
finance on which Britain had depended; the retreat into protectionism forced
exporters to rely more heavily on Empire markets. At the same time 'mergers,
collusion, cartelisation and protection may have insulated British
manufacturers from the chill winds of domestic and foreign competition'. Yet
the habit of collusion was even more deeply entrenched in Germany.
Moreover, entrepreneurial dynamism was far from lacking in inter-war
Britain. The chemical and electrical industries recovered from their earlier
lag; the growth of the motor industry was impressive; and there was a
promising start in electronics.
Despite structural problems in older sectors, especially textiles, Britain
remained a powerful industrial nation. So why did Britain fall behind in the
1950s and 1960s?
Charles Feinstein argues persuasively that rapid growth in Germany, France
and Italy 'owed far more to their low starting point than to any special
merits of their particular economic and social arrangements'. According to
his backwardness-convergence hypothesis, overtaken countries eventually
respond to their changed circumstances, as Britain did in the 1980s.
'Established attitudes and ossified institutions will finally be recognised
as barriers to progress, and will gradually be forced to make way for new
and more efficient arrangements'.
No doubt there is still a residue from Britain's industrial past which has
to be cleared away. But it is probably a mistake to conflate the post-1945
story - an initial lag followed by partial modernisation - with Britain's
loss of industrial dominance in the 19th century. Both episodes need to be
analysed, as they are in this book, realistically and without nostalgia;
neither should be a cause of national lamentation.

FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways rebounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having underperformed the market by close on 5 per cent over the past month,
British Airways rebounded 8 1/2 to 361 1/2 p as enthusiam for the shares
built up ahead of the group's traffic flows results for October, due
Thursday.
After traffic growth of 7.3 per cent in September, most analysts are
expecting a significant slowdown for the latest month as BA moves into
slower seasonal trading. Best bets among the major houses point to an
October traffic gain of between 4 and 5 per cent.
At all events the shares traded in a turnover of 4m, helped by stories that
a big US house - possibly Goldman Sachs - was recommending clients to buy a
portfolio of airline stocks with a heavy European weighting, including KLM
and BA.
Leading stores group Marks and Spencer was sold in early trading following
news that the head of its US arm had quit the company. Although Brooks
Brothers represents a very small part of M&amp;S profits, there were concerns
that the resignation foreshadowed a general withdrawal from the US. Some
particularly bearish analysts saw signs that UK retailers were unable to
operate successfully overseas. M&amp;S receded 4 before rallying with the market
to close a net penny up at 416p.
Elsewhere in the sector, Storehouse was also weaker, with turnover heavy at
above 8m shares and the stock slipping 2 to 217p.
Dixons was actively traded, with dealers saying that the 3.5m turnover
represented a strong two-way pull on the stock. The shares declined 4 1/2 to
192p, with Smith New Court believed to have been putting the sell argument.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries initially fell 9 in
reaction to the launch of a class action lawsuit in Florida against leading
tobacco manufacturers. Analysts said that the Florida tobacco action being
certified as a class action posed more liability danger than previous
tobacco lawsuits.
However, the shares received broker support - Lehman Brothers recommended
them ahead of third-quarter figures due today - and they ended the day only
2 lower at 437p.
Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, retreated 7 to 632p following a
television news report which cast a shadow over Septrin, a product to which
Wellcome contributes.
Bank shares were firmer, with the UK sector boosted by news that the Lehman
Brothers strategy team has included it as one of its most attractive
sectors.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which ran up 9 to 449p yesterday, was one of
Lehman's favoured UK banking stocks.
Standard Chartered dipped 7 to 286p after James Capel, the agency broker,
was said to have placed 1.5m shares. Another leading broking house was said
to have recommended a switch out of Standard and into HSBC.
Royal Insurance easily outpaced the rest of the composite insurance sector,
having been given a strong push by BZW, whose insurance team recently
visited Royal's US operations.
BZW insisted that the shares were 'some 20 per cent undervalued'. It said
that the outlook for Royal's US operations was considerably more promising
and a convergence to industry average returns would imply a turnround of
some Dollars 150m per annum in pre-tax profits. By the close, Royal shares
were 7 higher at 299p.
There was no let-up in the chase to buy the utilities, with the recs posting
further big gains on the prospects of bumper special dividends and sharp
profits increases when the interim reporting season gets under way in
December.
Water stocks were boosted by higher than expected interims from Thames
Water, although profit-taking left the latter a shade off at 531 1/2 p.
In the recs, East Midland jumped 35 to 721p as the market became
increasingly excited about the prospect of another special dividend post the
sell-off of the National Grid. Other recs to move higher included Eastern,
25 1/2 ahead at 821 1/2 p, and Manweb, 23 stronger at 830p.
A press report that Eurotunnel faces a potentially heavy bill for local
authority rates pushed the Units 4 lower to 231p in very thin trading
conditions. The company is said to be seeking government help to soften a
rates assessment of Pounds 42m by Folkestone County Council. The assessment
compares with forecast revenue by the company for this year of around Pounds
37m.
Media conglomerate Pearson improved 8 to 642p as SG Warburg reiterated its
positive recommendation.

<TEXT>
Food manufacturer United Biscuits advanced 9 to 315p as SG Warburg sent a
note to clients arguing that the shares had fallen too far. The house sector
specialists said the stock was at a five-year relative yield high and price
low and commented: 'We continue to regard United Biscuits as one of the best
recovery stocks in the sector.'
Other analysts cited a return of bid speculation which has been touching the
company for some time. UB is seen as being one of the only UK food
manufacturers with enough overseas interests to attract one of the big
international players.

FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP weak on US influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sense of anti-climax spread across the oils sector as British Petroleum
shares retreated in the wake of the third-quarter figures and following a
steep fall on Wall Street. BP hit all-time highs in sterling and dollar
terms on Monday.
Dealers said BP's third-quarter numbers were at the very top end of
expectations but that the market had been mildly disappointed with the
unchanged dividend, although some of the more conservative analysts said
that hopes of an increase in the payment were unrealistic.
It was also pointed out that BP shares had outperformed the market by 7 per
cent over the past month and were due for a period of consolidation, albeit
in a much higher trading band than has been the case in the past couple of
years.
Another bearish factor affecting BP was news that two of the influential
Wall Street brokerages, Smith Barney and Prudential Bache, took the view
that the oil majors are now overvalued. And at least two of the important
London-based securities houses, including Goldman Sachs and NatWest
Securities, were seen to be big sellers of BP shares yesterday. The stock
retreated 9 to 426p on slightly disappointing turnover of 9.8m.

FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally following Bank inflation
report - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An extremely volatile trading session left the UK stock market showing
little change on the day after early losses had been quickly recovered when
the Bank of England released an unexpectedly favourable report on domestic
inflation prospects.
Trading was overshadowed from the opening by apprehension ahead of the
latest National Purchasing Managers Index in the US and the Bank of England
Quarterly Bulletin, both released in mid-afternoon.
The market drifted easier before dropping sharply when the US Purchasing
Managers Index alarmed the dollar and US and global bond markets by
disclosing the highest level of business activity for seven years, with its
prices component also stronger than expected. The FT-SE 100-share Index
extended its loss to show a net fall of nearly 20 points within a few
minutes of the US news. However, traders said there was no time for any
selling pressure to develop.
The Bank of England Bulletin, released shortly afterwards, inspired a
dramatic turnround in UK bonds and equities. The FT-SE 100 Index climbed
back into plus territory, albeit briefly, and ended only 1.1 off at 3,096.3.
At the close, London brushed aside both weakness in US bonds and the fall of
nearly 30 points on the Dow Industrial Average in UK trading hours.
The Bank's prediction that domestic inflation would stay in the lower half
of its target range for the next two years, and that wage inflation was
posing no problems, appeared to remove the market's fears of any sudden
upward move in base rates. Analysts commented that much of this week's
debate over base rates has been one of timing; the market had long ago
braced itself for higher rates at some time in the future.
However, market analysts were cautious about abandoning the view that the
Bank may still tighten policy at some stage as economic recovery continues,
especially in view of the further evidence yesterday of pressures in the US.
Traders warned that the recovery in the market towards the close should be
regarded as further evidence of London's volatility rather than of a change
of investment sentiment. Seaq volume remained poor, with the day's total of
471.8m shares through the electronic reporting network a shade lower than in
the previous session.
In the early part of the day, volume was very slow, although the Footsie
moved erratically, opening 15 points down but almost regaining the overnight
level at midsession. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at 3,524.3 for a rise of
7.4 as the utility sector continued to race ahead. Trading in non-Footsie
stocks, incorporating many utilities, made up around 55 per cent of total
business.
The market closed with an irregular pattern. British Petroleum ended the
session lower as not even excellent trading figures could offset Wall
Street's influence and some disappointment that the dividend payout had not
been raised. Shell Transport was easier, and most of the dollar-orientated
stocks, including pharmaceuticals, were unable to make progress at the
close.
Retail and consumer shares, the most closely linked to base rate worries,
made only a cautious response to the Bank's favourable comments on
inflation. Banks, which have also proved sensitive to threats of higher base
rates because of the negative implications for their bad debt portfolios,
turned firmer. A leading US securities house turned positive on the UK
banking sector this week.
Traders were unwilling to be drawn on prospects for the opening of the
London market this morning. Some suggested that yesterday afternoon's rally
might prove to be as much as London could manage if the US and European bond
markets remain weak.

FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Low trading volume, narrow premiums and a trading range just short of 40
points added up to a volatile day for stock index futures, writes Jeffrey
Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,119 at the official 4.10pm close, up
10 points. The premium to the cash market was 10 points and fair value
premium was just under 12 points.
Trading volume was thin and traders described conditions as 'very squeezy
all day'. The general quality of business was low, with most activity
provided by the local, independent traders.
For the most part the December contract did little more than drift, making
scant attempt to provide cash equities with a lead. The day's low was 3,085,
with the 3,121 peak occurring just before the close of pit trading.
Volume was only 9,600 contracts, down from around 12,000 on Monday. The
closure of the Matif, the French futures market, for All-Saint's Day was one
of the more obvious reasons for the low level of activity.
The resilience of the December contract in the face of the clear weakness on
Wall Street - both US equities and bonds were trading sharply south when
London closed - surprised many traders.
The traded options market was significantly busier than on Monday, with
55,409 lots dealt against 31,215.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil falls by 2%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern about November inflation and a possible further increase in nominal
interest rates dragged stock prices down for the second day in a row to
close 2.02 per cent lower yesterday.
Trading was sluggish since most investors were out of the market ahead of
the All Saints Day holiday today, when Brazil's markets are closed. The
Bovespa index retreated a further 970 points to 47,009.
Investors were worried about forecasts that the November inflation rate
could reach 3 per cent after a 1.9 per cent rise in October.
US investment bank Merrill Lynch has reduced its portfolio weighting in
Latin American markets in view of the gains shown since the summer and their
'historic sensitivity to sharp movements in US interest rates'. It said
Brazil faced a difficult few months ahead and the change in government could
mark a correction from recent gains. The bank has increased its portfolio
weightings in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): NAPM report sends Dow sharply
lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices ended sharply lower across the board yesterday in the wake
of a weaker bond market, which was disturbed by a stronger than expected
manufacturing sector report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 44.75 to 3,863.37.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.93 to 468.42, while the
American Stock Exchange composite retreated 3.05 to 455.52 and the Nasdaq
composite shed 5.30 to 772.19. Trading volume on the New York SE came to
315m shares.
Following Monday's losses, the stock market opened in a bearish mood. Early
falls in the bond market only deepened the gloom. The losses, which sent the
yield on the 30-year bond back above 8 per cent, were prompted by a rise in
the National Association of Purchasing Management's index of business
activity from 58.2 per cent in September, to 59.7 per cent in October.
Wall Street had expected a 59.0 per cent reading and analysts said the data
only increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise interest
rates at some time within the next month. The consensus is that monetary
policy will be tightened following the November 15 meeting of the Fed's open
market committee.
Share prices fell because stock market investors are fearful that another
interest rate increase will slow the economy down too far, and break the
pattern of steady growth of corporate earnings. Also, higher interest rates
could eventually persuade investors to move out of stocks and into
fixed-income assets. Later in the day, equities fell further amid
computerised program selling, which at one point pushed the Dow's decline
beyond 50 points.
Among individual stocks, cyclicals were notably weaker, unsettled by
concerns about the long-term economic outlook. Caterpillar fell Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 , International Paper Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 3/8
and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 3/8 .
The oils sector, which had a good run last week, encountered selling after
broking house Prudential Securities downgraded several leading stocks. Mobil
retreated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 83, Exxon Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 3/4
, Royal Dutch Petroleum Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 114 1/4 and Chevron Dollars
 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 .
In the Nasdaq market, Biogen plunged Dollars 9, or 18 per cent, to Dollars
40 in volume of 9.5m shares as investors reacted to Monday's late news that
the company is taking a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge to cover the cost of
halting the development of its anticoagulent Hirulog, which was one of its
most promising drugs.

The worrisome economic news out of the US took Canadian stocks lower in
moderate trading. The TSE 300 composite index finished 28.13 off at
4,263.52, while declines outscored rises by 448 to 308 after volume of 58.3m
shares.
Losses were broadly based, with all 14 sub-indices weaker, led by forestry,
transportation, consumer products and metals. The golds group dipped 0.4 per
cent in spite of a rise in the New York spot price for gold of 80 cents to
USDollars 384.55 an ounce.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Dollar's decline against
yen leaves Nikkei easier
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar's fall to the Y96 level and Monday's decline on Wall Street
generated caution, and the Nikkei 225 average declined on arbitrage linked
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 73.12 at 19,916.48 after a day's high of 19,929.49 and low of
19,836.97. Unwinding of arbitrage positions depressed share prices, while
financial institutions took profits on large-capitalisation stocks.
Volume was 250m shares, against 243m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 5.31 to 1,579.35 and the Nikkei 300 dipped 1.31 to 289.19.
Losers led gainers by 531 to 410, with 210 issues unchanged. The ISE/Nikkei
50 index eased 0.41 to 1,300.45.
Traders said sentiment was depressed by the low trading volumes. The balance
of margin buying reflected sluggish activity, with the outstanding balance
of stocks bought on margin last week falling for the 14th consecutive week.
The balance of margin buying on the Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya exchanges was
down Y10.3bn from the previous week to Y2,036.8bn, while investors sold
short a net Y419.6bn, up by Y1.4bn.
Softbank, an over-the-counter software company, was suspended from trading
for the day due to reports that it would take over the trade-show business
of Ziff Communications, a US media company, for around Dollars 200m.
Large-capitalisation shares retreated on profit-taking: Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries declined Y3 to Y786. However, Nippon Steel, the day's most active
issue, rose Y3 to Y403.
The retail sector was the biggest loser, with Jusco, a large supermarket
chain, falling Y50 to Y2,130 and Seiyu losing Y40 to Y1,150. High-technology
exporters were down on the higher yen: Toshiba receded Y11 to Y753 and
Fujitsu Y20 to Y1,090.
Japan Telecom finished Y80,000 firmer at Y3.62m, while Japan Tobacco rose
Y30,000 to Y1.11m. The latter was left untraded for the bulk of the
afternoon, reflecting the lack of enthusiasm among investors towards the
overall market.
Teijin, a textile company, gained Y14 at Y600 on projections of an earnings
recovery, while Alpine Electronics added Y40 at Y2,020 after a rise in its
interim recurring profits.
Stock prices in Osaka eased in light activity, the OSE average losing 6.51
at 22,088.44 in volume of 32.1m shares.
Roundup
Weakness was widespread among the region's markets.
TAIPEI dropped by 5 per cent as institutions sold heavily in the electronics
and financial sectors. The weighted index plummeted 325.26 to 6,201.21 in
turnover of TDollars 52.82bn. Walsin Wire and Cable, the day's second most
active issue, fell TDollars 1 to TDollars 32.90 and, among banks, ICBC lost
TDollars 6.50 at TDollars 90.50. China Development declined by the daily 7
per cent limit to TDollars 131.50.
Marine shares that had previously risen on sound profits forecasts were also
weak - the most active issue, Yang Ming Marine, was limit down at TDollars
36.90.
Brokers said the market was expected to consolidate before parliamentary
elections due on December 3.
HONG KONG was lower on profit-taking after the strong gains of recent
sessions. The Hang Seng index slipped 72.85 to 9,573.40, while the Hang Seng
China Enterprises index, which monitors H-shares of mainland China
companies, receded 27.16 to 1,361.82 after Monday's 4 per cent rise.
Turnover shrank to HKDollars 3.22bn from the previous day's HKDollars
4.15bn.
Hong Kong Telecommunications, whose interim net profits gain of 15 per cent
was in line with expectations, relinquished 35 cents at HKDollars 16.20 on
profit-taking, and as analysts voiced concern at lower than expected revenue
growth.
Among the H-shares, Kun-ming Machine went against the trend, gaining 5 cents
at HKDollars 3.10, in spite of a pessimistic report on its prospects by
Salomon Brothers.
SEOUL remained marginally ahead in active trading after profit-taking and a
state fund's intervention erased much of an early strong gain. The composite
index closed 2.81 firmer at 1,108.43, off a day's high of 1,116.48, in
volume of 51.2m shares, compared with Monday's 55.9m.
The sharp early rise in the index for the third straight day prompted
profit-taking across the board and sell orders worth Won31.5bn by the stock
market stabilisation fund.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further forced selling by clients unable to meet margin
calls and the market finished 1.4 per cent lower, the composite index losing
15.27 at 1,093.58. Trading, however, was subdued ahead of a public holiday
today.
Tenaga Nasional, the utility giant, was among the day's big losers, tumbling
60 cents to MDollars 13.00.
SINGAPORE was lower after the overnight fall on Wall Street and in response
to the forced selling of Malaysian stocks by clients unable to meet margin
calls.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 14.84 to end at the day's low of
2,364.19.
DBS Land warrants were actively traded, losing 4 cents at SDollars 1.92,
after an intraday high of SDollars 2.04.
SYDNEY declined as sentiment was hit by renewed weakness in offshore
markets. The All Ordinaries index fell 16.8 to 2,028.0, while an estimated
199m shares were traded, valued at ADollars 749m.
All the leading issues were weaker, with BHP closing 14 cents down at
ADollars 20.50 in volume of 1.96m shares.
Miners were hit by lower commodity prices - CRA dipped 12 cents to ADollars
19.04 and MIM 3 cents to ADollars 2.90. WMC ended 14 cents lower at ADollars
8.25.
Amcor, the packaging group which announced that it had launched an ADollars
134m takeoverbid for RIG Rentsch Industrie Holding, of Switzerland, shed 11
cents to ADollars 8.85.
BANGKOK weathered profit-taking throughout the day to close higher. The SET
index moved ahead 7.65 to 1,536.48 in heavy turnover of Bt9.6bn.
Scattered buying appeared in communication issues, banks and construction
materials companies, while selling emerged in the finance and property
sectors.
KARACHI eased towards the close on the first day of the new account. The KSE
100-share index shed 8.75 to 2,202.34, with losers leading gainers by 213 to
93. Dewan Textile fell Rp10 to Rp350.
WELLINGTON was supported by strength in leading stocks, which helped the
NZSE-40 capital index to a gain of 8.85 at 2,109.32 in turnover of NZDollars
41.8m.
Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge both rose by 5 cents to NZDollars
4.43 and NZDollars 3.99 respectively, while Brierley Investments gained 1
cent to NZDollars 1.23. All three stocks attracted high turnover, indicating
overseas support.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Sleepy bourses offer mild
reaction to US data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For once, the reaction to US data, as the NAPM October index came out much
higher than expected, was more marked in the US than in Europe, writes Our
Markets Staff. Among senior bourses, Paris, Milan and Madrid were closed for
All Saints Day.
ZURICH saw further action in UBS, as the market mulled nine-month figures
out late on Monday, but the SMI index shed 2.6 to 2,503.9 in otherwise quiet
conditions.
UBS bearers fell SFr41 or 3.5 per cent to SFr1,136 and the registered SFr10
or 3.7 per cent to SFr257 as Credit Suisse reduced its earnings estimates
for this year and next.
However, Mr Ian McEwan at Merrill Lynch said that the figures were in line
with expectations and the share price fall a further reaction to the board's
continuing battle for influence with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision, which
holds about 18 per cent of the registered stock. In his view, the bearers
were still 'wildly overvalued', and he saw SFr1,000 as a more realistic
valuation.
The registered were trading at a premium of 34.4 per cent to the bearers on
September 29, when the board announced its plans for a single share category
to curb the power of predators. By yesterday, the premium had fallen to 13.1
per cent, suggesting that the market expected the board to win its battle
with Mr Ebner. BK Vision fell SFr40 or 3.1 per cent to SFr1,250, taking
cumulative losses since the battle lines were drawn to 13.8 per cent.
CS Holding, continuing to benefit from switching out of UBS, picked up SFr8
to SFr557.
Insurers, too, rose further, Zurich adding SFr18 at SFr1,163 and Swiss Re
bearers advancing SFr12 to SFr775.
FRANKFURT's Dax index closed the session at 2,069.73, fell to just over
2,062 after the NAPM data, and then recovered to an Ibis-indicated afternoon
close of 2,066.18, up 4.60. Pressure from bund futures eased towards the
end.
Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Munich were closed for the holiday, and German
stock market turnover fell from DM5.6bn to just DM3bn. Ms Barbara Altmann at
B Metzler in Frankfurt observed that share price moves needed to be
approached with care.
However, two of the main Ibis Dax moves, Volkswagen up DM9.20 to DM446.20
and Mannesmann up DM7.90 to DM407.40, might be significant, she said. VW and
Mannesmann both came under pressure some weeks ago as the weak dollar
threatened export-oriented cyclicals; the currency weakness might not be at
an end, but there might be some hope for its victims.
AMSTERDAM marked DSM down heavily as the chemicals group turned in
third-quarter figures at the lower end of analysts' expectations, and the
shares dipped Fl 5.00 or 3.4 per cent to Fl 141. However, an element of
profit-taking was also in evidence following solid gains in the stock over
the past week.
Brokers expected DSM to rally in the medium term given the forecasts for
good full-year figures, while the group remarked that the weaker dollar was
not expected to have a significant effect on earnings, at least in the
short-term.
The AEX index ended with a loss of 2.37 at 410.25.
KLM went against the trend on brokers' upgrades ahead of today's first-half
results, and the shares advanced Fl 1.60 to Fl 48.50. There were
expectations that the airline would return net profits in the region of Fl
300m.
STOCKHOLM eased gently as good corporate results offset the international
mood. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.00 to 1,482.00 in moderate
turnover of SKr2.25bn.
Results came from Aga, the industrial gases group, which put on SKr5 to
SKr73, although James Capel said that its forecast of a 20 per cent rise in
profits this year was in line with expectations. However, there was no
argument about Autoliv, the car safety equipment company: earnings per share
were up 81 per cent after nine months, and the shares rose SKr22, or nearly
9 per cent to SKr276.
OSLO's All-share index finished 4.37 down at 600.67 in turnover of NKr478m.
Hafslund Nycomed 'A' closed NKr1.50 higher at NKr120, its nine-month results
proving above some expectations. Den norske Bank, reporting in line with
forecasts, saw its free 'A' shares slip NKr0.10 to NKr16.90 on profit-taking
after a strong showing on Monday.
COPENHAGEN was led lower by a sharp decline in AP Moller's stocks amid
worries about the effect on the shipping group of the weak dollar and poor
international shipping rates. The KFX index fell 1.20 to 93.47.
Moller's 1912 'B' share fell DKr4,000 to a year's low of DKr98,000 while its
Svendborg 'B' stock shed DKr5,500 to DKr141,000.
HELSINKI was pulled lower by declines in forestry shares and Nokia, the
telecoms based conglomerate. The Hex index slipped 13.8 to 1,940.2. One of
the sadder stories was the drop of FM3.50 to a new 1994 low in EffJohn,
whose Silja Line subsidiary, in the ferry business but not connected to the
Estonia sinking at the end of September, said that the number of its
passengers fell by 15 per cent last month.
