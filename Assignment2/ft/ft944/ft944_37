FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg weakens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
De Beers fell by a net R2 at R96.50 after an earlier loss of R3. Dealers
said that the group was under pressure from a court trial in the US where
General Electric Co is alleged to have conspired in 1991 and 1992 with a De
Beers affiliate to fix prices of industrial diamonds.
The stock, they said, was also being hit by speculation that the Central
Selling Organisation's marketing agreement with Russia was coming under
pressure.
The broad market lost ground as the lower bullion price and weak world
markets made their effect felt.
The overall index came off its low for the day to end 15 down at 5,708,
industrials slipped 29 to 6,578 and golds shed 16 to 2,208, also off the
day's worst.
Anglos were marked up by R1 to R237. Engen dipped 50 cents to R34.50 ahead
of its annual results, while Sasol lost 75 cents at R34.75.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Bank calms market nerves about higher rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling lost some of its lustre yesterday after the Bank of England
released a fairly benign quarterly inflation report, writes Philip Gawith.
Traders assumed that the Bank's report makes less likely a decision to raise
interest rates at today's monthly monetary meeting between the UK chancellor
and the Governor of the Bank of England.
The report prompted a sharp rally in short sterling futures as traders
scrambled to cover short positions they had taken ahead of the report's
release.
The pound closed in London at DM2.4510, from DM2.4583, and at Dollars
1.6347, from Dollars 1.6306. After the report was released, it fell to
DM2.44 and below Dollars 1.63, before recovering.
The dollar traded sideways, finishing at DM1.4994 from DM1.5077, and Y96.755
from Y96.95, in spite of a US purchasing managers' report showing stronger
than expected price pressures. In New York the US currency ended at DM1.4947
and Y96.65.
Trade elsewhere was fairly thin, with most of Europe closed for All Saints
Day. The D-Mark was stronger against the lira, rising to L1,027 from L1,023.
It was also firmer against the krona, trading yesterday evening at SKr4.804
from SKr4.780.
The three-month sterling LIBOR rate firmed to 6 3/16 per cent, from 6 1/16
per cent, as traders became nervy about the prospect of higher rates. It
later eased to 6 1/8 per cent when the Bank's report, saying that the
inflation outlook had improved, was released.
In the short sterling market, prices jumped in after-hours' trading, with
the March contract rising around 15 basis points to 92.75. Analysts said the
market was experiencing a massive short-covering rally.
The core conclusion in the report was that the inflation outlook had
improved. The Bank now expects underlying inflation to be around 2.5 per
cent in two years time, down from the forecast in its last report of about 3
per cent.
Although the market's response was very bullish, some analysts said that an
early interest rate rise had not been ruled out.
Earlier there had been little to be gleaned from the Bank's daily money
market oper-ations. It provided Pounds 15m late assistance, after earlier
supplying Pounds 677m liquidity at established rates. The daily shortage was
Pounds 900m. Overnight money traded between 5 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.
One seasoned money market observer said the old days of reading the monetary
'tea leaves', for hints of the direction of policy, were past. While it was
fair to assume that a sustained period of easy money rates had the
acquiescence of the Bank, it would not be correct to assume that tighter
monetary conditions necessarily conveyed any signal about the Bank's
intentions.
As likely as not, he added, this reflected technical factors, such as who
was holding treasury bills, and whether or not they wanted to sell them to
the Bank.
'Now the focus is on the monthly monetary meeting. We have the Ken and Eddie
show,' he said.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said the market would
anyway be very suspicious of any message the Bank was alleged to be sending
through its daily market operations.
Many in the market were caught offside when the Bank last lifted rates on
September 12. They mistakenly inferred then that the Bank planned no policy
change when it set a two-week repurchase agreement, at established rates, a
few days before it raised rates.
One point made in favour of maintaining the status quo is that the
trade-weighted sterling index has appreciated by 3 per cent, from 78.6
before the last rate rise to yesterday's close of 80.9. This, according to a
rule of thumb sometimes cited in the market, is equivalent to an increase in
interest rates of about 75 basis points.
Some analysts felt that the Governor of the Bank, Mr Eddie George, had boxed
himself into a corner with his recent rhetoric. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury
economist at CIBC, said that if rates were raised against the backdrop of
recent 'emollient' comments about inflation, 'this would render totally
ineffective the speeches he gives on a weekly basis; what the market needs
is a period of stability, not a period of central bank induced instability'.
The dollar weakened in line with bonds after the NAPM report was released,
with the inflation component rising to 79.9 from 77.1. It later regained
some ground after comments from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, eased concerns about trade tensions with Japan.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Tragedy' for Windwards bananas
if Geest pulls out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The banana industry in the Caribbean Windward Islands group will become
'unstable' if Geest industries, which markets the islands' fruit, were to
discontinue its interest in bananas, according to senior government minister
in Dominica.
While the Windward Islands should not be 'overly concerned' about reports in
the UK press that Geest was considering its future in the banana business, a
pull-out by the company 'would create some instability and some sense of
uncertainty on the part of our farmers', said Mr Brian Alleyne, external
affairs minister of the island of Dominica.
The Windwards group, comprising Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent
provides two out of every three bananas eaten in the UK. The four islands
and Geest are at present negotiating a new contract for the marketing of
bananas. The economies of the Windward Islands are heavily dependent on the
banana trade.
'The banana industry has been examining a number of options, not only the
Geest negotiations, but alternatives in the event that we cannot arrive at a
satisfactory conclusion with Geest,' Mr Alleyne said. Geest had been helpful
to the islands in negotiations with the European Union over the marketing of
bananas, and it would be 'tragic, although not the end of the world for us.
. . if the company were to significantly reorganise its banana marketing
arrangements'.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iron ore recovery forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iron ore prices have reached their nadir, and should begin to edge up next
year, according to a study released by Sydney-based AME Mineral Economics.
It suggests a nominal one per cent increase in benchmark prices for fines in
1995, followed by rises of 5 and 6 per cent in the next two years.
This would reverse the trend of the past three years - when prices fell by
4.9 per cent, 11 per cent and then 9.5 per cent.
AME also suggests that there is potential for a more significant upswing in
the price of premium lump ore, where supply constraints are tighter. Here,
AME sees a rise of 4 per cent price in 1995, followed by 5 per cent in 1996.
The study argues that two factors will have a major bearing on world iron
ore prices. The first is the decreasing dependance of Australian on its
traditional Japanese customers, which could begin to undermine the annual
globalised setting of iron ore prices through contract negotiations with the
Japanese steel mills. The second is the premium placed on high-grade lump
ore, which is favoured by many large steelworks.
Looking further forward, AME sees a gloomy future for the sector.
Fast-growing Asian demand should sustain iron ore producers through to about
2005, it says. 'In the longer-term, however, Asian regional requirements may
not be sufficient to counterbalance increasing efficiency in steelmaking,
new technologies and the structural decline in traditional highly
industrialised markets.'
Turning to the supply side of the equation, AME says: 'Although some
high-grade deposits in Australia and Brazil are nearing exhaustion and their
production rates will decrease, there are sufficient known reserves in every
case not only to maintain but to increase production.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Car makers seen leading
aluminium demand surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in demand for aluminium to the year 2,000 will be substantially
faster than in the past seven years, driven particularly by consumption in
Asia and by the automotive industry, according to Mr Jacques Bougie,
president of Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminium producer.
However, demand growth for primary, or new, aluminium is forecast by Alcan
to rise only at the same rate as in the years 1986-93. 'Recycling,
particularly of beverage cans and cars, will play an increasingly important
part in metal sourcing to meet demand in future,' Mr Bougie predicts.
'Star performers' in future, the Alcan analysis suggests, will be the Asia
region, including a Japan recovering from recession, where annual aluminium
consumption growth is expected to be twice as fast as in the maturing North
American market. Growth in Europe and South America is also predicted to
outpace that in North America. But North America will remain the biggest
individual market for some years to come.
Alcan is forecasting that demand for aluminium in cars will grow at an
annual 6.5 per cent until the year 2000. Mr Bougie says much of that growth
will come from the increased use of castings which already constitute 70 to
80 per cent of the weight of aluminium in the average car. 'Further
significant growth may come after the year 2000 when aluminium body
structures are adopted for mass-produced cars,' he suggests.
Mr Bougie says that at present it is not possible to include the former
Eastern European markets in the forecasts because data are not reliably
available. But Alcan believes Russia's domestic consumption of aluminium in
1993 was only about 800,000 to 900,000 tonnes, with the 1.9m tonnes balance
of its production being exported to the west.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh highs reached at London
Metal Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment funds and speculators returned in force to the London Metal
Exchange yesterday to send most base metals prices to fresh peaks. Only
aluminium failed to beat the previous high in the present buying spree, but
its price still closed last night Dollars 46 above Monday's level at Dollars
1,855.50 a tonne for delivery in three months.
Copper moved above Dollars 2,700 a tonne for the first time in four years,
helped by weakness of the US dollar, which is making dollar-denominated LME
prices look cheaper in terms of other currencies. Traders said that buying
from the Far East yesterday helped to lift copper values.
The nickel market reached the highest price levels for two and a quarter
years, as did the lead market, while tin climbed to a 20-month peak. Even
zinc, which at the begining of this year was thought by many analysts to be
the LME metal with the most negative fundamental outlook, rose above Dollars
1,150 a tonne to reach a two-year peak.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton Metals, part of the Gencor
group, explained that there was a growing perception among investors that
the tide was turning for the zinc market.
Even so, the market was expected to see a 283,000-tonne supply surplus this
year. If the announced output cuts held, however, there might be a
250,000-tonne deficit in 1995, if Billiton was correct in its forecast that
demand for the metal would grow by a 'hefty' 5 per cent.
On that basis Billiton was forecasting that the average zinc price for next
year would be about 55 cents a pound (Dollars 1,212 a tonne). But Mr
MacMillan warned that it would not take much to wipe out the predicted
supply deficit, so much depended on production cuts staying in place.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jute mills scramble for
supplies - India fears a shortage of high grade fibre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian jute mills that have in recent years taken up production of high
value jute goods and export quality yarn in a big way have rushed to
Bangladesh to cover their requirement of superior grades of raw jute for the
current season.
Even as India, the largest producer of jute and jute goods, harvests a much
bigger crop than last year's the government and industry officials fear that
there is going to be an acute shortage of the higher grades.
According to the industry officials, Indian mills have so far signed
contracts for the import of 300,000 bales (180kg each) from Bangladesh. This
season's Indian imports from that country could reach 500,000 bales,
compared with about 300,000 in 1993-94. 'We have, however, drawn a blank in
Vietnam and China, which do not have any surplus of jute this year,' says an
official at the Indian Jute Mills Association. 'Last year, we imported some
fibre from Vietnam. Thailand is a net importer of jute.'
Bangladesh is harvesting 5.5m bales of jute in the current year, up from
5.1m in 1993-94, and the quality of the crop has turned out to be highly
satisfactory. As the country opened the season with stocks of 2.3m bales
total fibre availability will be 7.8m bales. Indian industry official
estimate that Bangladeshi mills will consume less than 3m bales, while the
requirement at village level will be about 400,000 bales. So Bangladesh will
have a plenty of exportable surplus.
According to the Indian Jute Development Council, the Indian jute and mesta
crops in 1994-95 will total 8.9m bales and not 9.5m, as the industry and the
trade earlier thought.
'Because of the high premium that jute and mesta fetched over the minimum
prices throughout the last season, the farmers committed 957,000 hectares to
the crop this year, against 892,000 hectares in 1993-94, says an official at
the Directorate of Jute Development. 'More land would have been brought
under the crop had the weather been favourable during the sowing period.'
Moreover, as some of the major jute growing centres like north Bengal and
Bihar experienced drought when the crop was growing, the average is expected
to decline to 1,860kg a hectare from 1,907kg in 1993-94. 'The late
harvesting of jute in many areas and the shortage of water for retting
(soaking) are responsible for the deterioration in the quality of the Indian
crop,' according to the DJD official.
The official estimate is that inferior grades' share in the total will rise
from 11.5 to 20 per cent in 1993-94. 'Besides the shortage of superior
grades of jute what is causing concern to the industry are the very high
prices of fibre around this time of year when the mills build up stocks,'
says the IJMA official. 'The mills should now be holding raw jute stocks
equal to at least one and a half months' requirement. But their present
fibre inventory can at the most sustain production for two weeks.'
Though this is traditionally the peak marketing period for jute, the
benchmark TD-4 grade is quoted at the unusually high price of Rs750 (Pounds
14.50) a quintal (100lb). Industry officials say the very low carryover into
the current season and the 'alarmingly low daily arrival of the crop in the
village markets' are responsible for the prevailing high prices. The
farmers, according to the Jute Balers' Association, are selling jute in
small lots as they expect prices to go up as the season progresses. It is
principally due to the high prices in India that the jute market in
Bangladesh is ruling firm, in spite of a bumper crop.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold price slide halted - Market
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London GOLD price was a shade firmer yesterday afternoon after a shaky
morning spent in the aftershock of Monday's fund-driven sell-off. At Dollars
383.75 a troy ounce the price was still 75 cents down at the close, but that
was 30 cents off the low.
Dealers said there was a sprinkling of fund buying to help the New York
market firm in very light business. 'A bit if physical interest has
triggered some short-covering as well,' one added.
'Once a floor is in place, we could see the investors coming back again,'
said another, adding that physical offtake alone would be insufficient to
rally the market.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures reversed an early rally as talk
circulated that a new independent forecast for Brazil's 1995-96 crop might,
like one by US banker Morgan Stanley, be far higher than most recent
estimates.
Morgan Stanley forecast Brazil's 1995-96 crop at between 20m and 22m bags
(60kg each).
That figure was well out of line with Brazil's own preliminary estimates of
between 13m and 15m bags. But traders said that the market could not ignore
rumours of that kind.
OIL prices rallied meanwhile as traders rushed to buy ahead of what they
expected to be a bullish report on US primary oil stocks.
Market players said that the American Petroleum Institute was likely to
report big falls in US petroleum products stocks, reflecting the impact of
pipeline disruptions after widespread flooding in the Houston area.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall on renewed rate rise
fears

US Treasury prices fell across the maturity range yesterday following a
stronger than expected purchasing managers' report, which raised fears that
the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner, rather than later.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/8 at 93,
yielding 8.055 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note
was down  1/8 at 99 29/32 , to yield 6.909 per cent.
Prices weakened after the National Association of Purchasing Management
reported its index of business activity rose to 59.7 per cent in October,
from 58.2 per cent in September. Analysts had expected a rise of only 59.0
per cent.
The market was particularly disturbed by the big jump in the NAPM's prices
index, which rose from 77.1 per cent to 79.9 per cent, an indication that
inflationary pressures may be building up in the manufacturing sector.
Inflation-sensitive investors were not reassured by the comments of Mr Ralph
Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM, who said that companies were reporting
difficulties in passing on higher materials prices to consumers.
The data sparked immediate selling of bonds as analysts judged that the NAPM
figures only increased the likelihood that the Fed would put up interest
rates at the next available opportunity.
Although most analysts still believe that the Fed will wait until its next
open market committee meeting on November 15 before tightening monetary
policy, the NAPM numbers heightened speculation over how large any rate
increase might be.
Although a few analysts said the Fed, in the wake of the NAPM report, might
raise rates by as much as 100 basis points (bringing the target on the Fed
funds rate to 5 3/4 per cent), the consensus on Wall Street remained that
any increase would more likely be of 50 basis points.
Later in the day, prices weakened further amid reports of futures-related
selling, and some selling by dealers hedging against a decline in the price
of mortgage-backed securities.
With several countries closed for All Saints' holiday, activity in most
European government bond markets was subdued, with prices range-trading in
thin volume.
UK gilts proved the main exception, rallying sharply after the Bank of
England's quarterly inflation report calmed fears of a near-term monetary
tightening.
In recent days, market participants had grown increasingly nervous about the
possibility that Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, might decide on another base
rate increase at their meeting today. However, after the report some dealers
said they now expect the next rate rise in early 1995.
The December long gilt futures contract rose as high as 101 1/4 before
closing around 101, up  13/32 on the day. At the short end of the yield
curve, the December short sterling future rose 0.07 to 93.57.
The gains were partly attributed to a scramble by trading accounts to cover
short positions. Although traders reported some investor buying, they said
most of the activity took place in the futures market.
German government bonds followed the US bond market lower, then tracked
gilts higher and rallied into the close.
The December bund futures contract on Liffe briefly breached technical
support at 89.00 to fall to 88.95, but that triggered heavy buying which
carried the contract to 89.39. It slipped back in after-hours trading to
around 89.11, unchanged on the day.
Bunds are likely to make little headway this week, with fresh 10-year
government supply looming early next week.
Swedish bonds weakened amid jitters ahead of today's budget statement by Mr
Goran Persson, the finance minister. The yield on the government bond due
2005 rose 11 basis points to 11.09 per cent.
Mr Persson is widely expected to detail the SKr61bn in budget cuts which the
Social Democrats announced during the election campaign.
However, some dealers were hoping he would announce additional measures to
tackle Sweden's budget deficit after Moody's, the rating agency, last week
placed its Aa2 debt rating under review for possible downgrading.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Growth in rating agencies
serving emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of credit rating agencies in emerging markets has grown rapidly
in recent months, according to a new Financial Times quarterly directory
published this week*.
The publication lists for the first time in one publication more than 3,000
ratings assigned to emerging market debt issues by 10 international and 20
local rating agencies, many of which have been formed in the last year.
Several other local agencies are beginning operations and the directory
plans to expand its coverage in future issues.
'Regulators of emerging markets view credit ratings as an effective way of
tackling problems of transparency in their jurisdictions,' said Mr Peter
Elstob, editor. 'Investors have already taken on board political or country
risks but this is the first time they have had access to local perceptions
of the borrowers' credit risk.'
Agencies including Standard &amp; Poor's, Duff &amp; Phelps and IBCA are active in
providing technical support to the newer agencies.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Swedish bonds top league
table

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All European government bond markets posted positive total returns in
October with the exception of France, where bonds were plagued by
pre-election jitters, JP Morgan's monthly government bond index monitor
shows.
Sweden was the best performing market, with a monthly return of 2.26 per
cent in local currency terms. It was buoyed by hopes that the new government
will take additional measures to cut the country's large budget deficit and
signs - including a 20 basis point interest rate increase - that in the
absence of fiscal tightening, the Riksbank will do its bit to slow the level
of economic activity.
In Belgium, lower than expected inflation data and a steepening yield curve
increased the market's attractiveness, the survey states. In Ireland, lower
money market rates also provided the bond market with an improvement in
funding costs.
'In both markets, funded spread trades over Germany became more attractive
in October, thus leading to significant foreign inflows,' the report states.
The Japanese market weakened on continuing economic recovery and the
edging-up of short rates allowed by the Bank of Japan. The market posted
local currency returns of minus 0.28 per cent.
In the US, continued signs of economic growth and a delay in further Fed
tightening pushed yields higher, resulting in a minus 0.06 per cent total
return.
Meanwhile, Kemper Investment Management's monthly bond survey, which
includes some of the smaller markets, found that Finnish bonds, with a
return of 3.68 per cent, posted the strongest gains, followed by Sweden and
Norway.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Hellenic Republic launches Y120bn
samurai issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New eurobond issues were rare yesterday, with many European markets closed
for holidays. However, activity is likely to increase dramatically over the
coming days, with a number of borrowers tipped to be coming to the market.
Spain's Comunidad Autonoma de Andalucia is expected to launch its debut
eurodollar offering imminently.
The issue, lead managed by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, is expected to
be a Dollars 250m offering of 5 1/4 -year bonds, priced to yield around 40
basis points over US Treasuries, a market source said.
Andalucia tapped the D-Mark and French franc sectors last year with five and
10-year offerings respectively.
The Hellenic Republic yesterday launched a Y120bn offering of samurai bonds,
targeted at Japanese investors.
The offering, lead managed by Nomura, was divided into three tranches: Y60bn
of four-year bonds offering a coupon of 5.05 per cent, Y40bn of seven-year
bonds with a coupon of 6.1 per cent, and Y20bn of 15-year bonds offering a
coupon of 7.1 per cent.
Salomon Brothers and CS First Boston have been mandated to lead-manage the
launch of the republic's first global eurodollar offering, which is expected
to be launched after a series of road-shows next week.
The offering is likely to be in the five-year area, market sources said.
In the sterling sector, Irish Permanent, the former building society which
was recently floated as a bank, launched a Pounds 100m offering of
three-year floating-rate bonds offering a coupon of 10 basis points over
three-month Libor.
The closure of most European markets had little effect on the success of the
offering, since it was supported primarily by UK institutional interest,
with further demand from German investors, lead manager NatWest Markets
said.
Irish Permanent tapped the floating-rate sterling sector last year, and the
proceeds from yesterday's offering will be used partly to repay a US dollar
syndicated loan also launched last year, the lead manager said.
There is currently firm demand for dollar issues, especially in the
three-year area, a syndicate official at NatWest markets said. Other
building societies in particular are keen buyers of the three-year sector,
he said.
The proceeds from the offering were believed to have been swapped into Irish
punts.
Beijing Expressways, a special purpose vehicle created by the infrastructure
financing arm of the Beijing municipal government, is expected to launch a
three-tranche Dollars 460m offering later this week, lead-managed by Lehman
Brothers. The offering will involve five-year, 10-year and 12-year bonds.
Also in the dollar sector, Banco Votorantim launched a Dollars 50m offering
of three-year bonds, priced to yield 435 basis points over US government
bonds, lead-managed by ING Bank.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Setbacks at Japanese oil
distributors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading oil distributors saw declines in sales and operating profits
for the first half to September, due to the the time lag in transferring
crude oil procurement costs to wholesale prices.
Nippon Oil, the industry leader, saw non-consolidated interim recurring
profits - before extraordinary items and tax - decline 31.4 per cent to
Y13.3bn (Dollars 137m) on a 0.7 per cent fall in sales to Y868.9bn.
Operating profits plunged 42.9 per cent to Y5.9bn and after-tax profits
declined 24.7 per cent to Y6.8bn.
The company said procurement costs rose before they could be factored into
its wholesale prices.
It also failed to benefit from the 40.8 per cent rise in fuel oil sales
triggered by demand from an increase in electric power generation due to the
hot summer.
For the full year to next March, the company expects the rise in crude oil
prices to continue to affect its profitability, in spite of an expected rise
in sales volume.
Unconsolidated recurring profits are forecast to fall 21.9 per cent to Y33bn
on a 1.3 per cent increase in sales to Y1,830bn.
Cosmo Oil said sales fell 1.8 per cent to Y678.8bn and operating profits
declined 12.4 per cent to Y14.5bn. Current earnings, however, rose 4.2 per
cent to Y12.9bn due to rationalisation efforts and an improved balance on
its financial items. After-tax profits rose 1.9 per cent to Y5.3bn.
The company said procurement costs rose by Y5.2bn. In spite of a rise in
other costs, the company refrained from increasing wholesale prices in fear
of further dampening demand.
For the full year to next March, Cosmo expects a 0.6 per cent rise in
recurring profits to Y39bn on a 0.1 per cent increase in sales to Y1,440bn.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Profits at HK Telecom advance
15% at halfway
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hongkong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless of the
UK, yesterday met market expectations with a 15 per cent rise in net profits
to HKDollars 4.19bn (USDollars 542m) for the six months to September 30.
This compares with HKDollars 3.65bn at the halfway stage last year.
Earnings were struck on an operating profit of HKDollars 4.75bn, up 14 per
cent from HKDollars 4.17bn the previous year. Turnover rose 11 per cent to
HKDollars 13.29bn, from HKDollars 11.94bn, with the biggest increases
registered by equipment sales and rentals. International telephone services,
which account for 62 per cent of turnover, improved 9 per cent to HKDollars
8.24bn
The deceleration in international traffic growth was largely brought about
by a slowdown in China traffic, which up until this year had been growing at
a rate of more than 30 per cent annually. This has slowed to 21 per cent,
which the company attributes to the macroeconomic control measures and low
telephone line penetration, which now stands at one telephone for every 30
people.
However, analysts questioned how much of a role the austerity measures,
which were in place during the previous financial year, could have played in
slowing telephone calls. China accounts for almost half of international
traffic, and about one-third of international revenues.
Earnings per share grew 15 per cent to 37.6 cents from 32.8 cents; the
dividend rose to 26.9 cents from 23.4 cents.
Hongkong Telecom also bore the brunt of reduced international call charges,
which saw the price of calls on the most important routes to the US,
Australia, Canada and the UK fall by 10 per cent. These reductions, twinned
with an earlier round of cost-trimming, cost Hongkong Telecom about
HKDollars 300m over the last six months, a figure which is expected to reach
HKDollars 420m for the full year.
Mr Linus Cheung, chief executive, said strong growth in mobile operations -
in which Hongkong Telecom has a 34 per cent market share - and tight cost
controls fuelled the growth in interim profits.
This raises question marks over future growth, as earnings driven by cost
control may prove more difficult to sustain. Analysts believe salaries, the
second largest component of costs and up 8 per cent this interim, may be
harder to contain once competition starts on domestic fixed lines next July.
The biggest percentage saving was made on the management fees payable to
Cable &amp; Wireless. These fell 38 per cent to HKDollars 108m following a
revised basis for payment: Hongkong Telecom now pays according to work done
on its behalf by Cable &amp; Wireless, rather than a revenue-related fee.
Hongkong Telecom expects returns on its China joint ventures, unveiled last
month, by late 1995 to early 1996.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Engen declines 13% to R418m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Difficult trading conditions through most of the year increased pressure on
margins at Engen, the South African oil group, resulting in a 13.1 per cent
fall in after-tax income to R418m (Dollars 104m) for the year to August,
down from R481m previously.
Although turnover increased by 9.5 per cent to R8.45bn from R7.72bn,
operating income after exceptional items and inventory effects dropped 5.4
per cent to R547m from R578m.
Net financing expenses rose to R49m, compared with R16m in interest income a
year ago.
Mr Rob Angel, managing director, said that the results represented a
satisfactory performance given a generally disappointing pick-up in sales
volumes to the South African market, which grew only 1.6 per cent by volume
on the year, and a Dollars 1 a barrel reduction in refining margins during
the second half of the year.
As anticipated, net borrowings rose sharply to R787m from R335m, largely to
fund capital expenditure on the second phase of expansion to a Durban
refinery which will enable the company to process cheaper crude.
The upgraded plant is expected to come on stream during December slightly
below its R800m budget.
Mr Angel, who is an outspoken supporter of full deregulation of the South
African oil industry, which has historically been tightly controlled by the
state, also attacked the government's 'piecemeal tampering with the
regulatory system', which he said had cost Engen R100m in lost income over
the past year.
Nevertheless, the company reported that in July and August, petrol sales
rose 5 per cent in the first real indication of economic recovery.
Mr Angel said he was optimistic that sales would pick up substantially in
the next financial year.
Meanwhile, Engen's export performance, primarily to other African countries,
continued to expand rapidly, growing 17.5 per cent to 6.7m barrels, up from
5.7m barrels previously and representing strong growth considering the
company only began seeking out foreign markets five years ago.
Mr Angel also said that the company was actively seeking new upstream
investments, particularly in Africa, to complement its existing ventures in
the North Sea and Oman.

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Metal Mining, one of Japan's leading gold and nickel mining
companies and ranking third in copper, yesterday reported a big fall in
pre-tax profits for the first six months to September 30, AP-DJ reports from
Tokyo.
However, the 49 per cent decline to Y355m (Dollars 3.6m) from Y692m a year
ago was broadly in line with expectations.
The net profit of Y158m was 29 per cent lower than last year's Y122m, and
was scored on sales of Y182.43bn, down 5.1 per cent from Y192.33bn last
time.
The company maintained its forecast of a slight recovery in pre-tax profit
in the full year ending March 30 1995.
Sumitomo said that although the market for copper and nickel recovered
somewhat during the six-month period, contract-currency prices of both gold
and nickel were lower than a year before because of the yen's strength. A
company official said Sumitomo saw an average rate of Y101.00 to the dollar
during the period.
The company said volume sales of gold and copper declined from a year
before. Copper sales, for instance, fell 8.2 per cent to 94,841 tonnes,
while gold sales were down 4 per cent to 10,828kg.
As a result, overall sales in the company's metals division dropped 10 per
cent to Y145.58bn from Y162.52bn.
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange the company's shares closed Y7 down at Y953.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Softbank to pay Dollars 202m for
Ziff unit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Softbank, a Japanese computer software company, has agreed to acquire the
trade-show business of Ziff Communications, the US publishing group, for
more than Dollars 202m.
The agreement came after Softbank failed to acquire the publishing business
of Ziff-Davis, which was sold to Forstmann Little, a New York investment
group, for Dollars 1.4bn.
The trade-show business of Ziff runs exhibitions of information
network-related software and equipment, and had sales of about Dollars 90m
this year, the Japanese company said. Ziff operates the world's largest
trade show on network computing.
The addition of Ziff's trade show operations will lift Softbank's
involvement in the trade show business, and add value to its network-related
operations which have been growing strongly in recent years, the company
said. It will also help it to expand operations in the US.
The acquisition, which Softbank intends to finance with its own funds, is
not expected to affect the Japanese company's results in the year to next
March, the company said.
Softbank is a fast-growing company involved in the distribution of computer
software, hardware and peripherals, and publication of magazines.

Amcor, the Australian packaging and paper group, is hoping to almost double
its European sales with the ADollars 134m (USDollars 99m) purchase of RIG
Rentsch, a publicly-listed folding carton packaging business based in
Switzerland.
It announced an agreed bid for the Swiss company yesterday, offering
SFr2,550 (USDollars 2,024) per bearer share, and SFr510 per registered
share. Rentsch's principal shareholders, with about 72.5 per cent of the
voting capital, have accepted the terms, and public shareholders, who hold
the remaining 27.5 per cent, will be presented with an identical offer.
Rentsch has annual sales of around ADollars 300m, of which about 60 per cent
come from tobacco packaging. By coincidence, Amcor's directors faced
questioning over the ethics of packaging for the cigarette industry at last
week's annual general meeting in Sydney.
Mr Athol Lapthorne, chairman, said Amcor had considered the matter - the
Rentsch deal had clearly not yet been disclosed - but decided that it was in
shareholders' interests that the company should remain in this business. His
remarks were applauded by the several hundred shareholders at the meeting.
The Swiss company operates nine manufacturing facilities, all but one of
which produce folding cartons. Its plants are spread across Europe and
include sites in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Poland and
Switzerland.
Mr Chris Nixon, managing director of Amcor's containers packaging division,
said the company expected Rentsch to post earnings before interest and tax
of about ADollars 20m in the first year.
Amcor has been pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy recently, building
up interests in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. However,
this is the first time it has moved into container packaging in Europe.
Amcor's European sales were ADollars 367m in the year to end-June, out of a
group figure of ADollars 5.5bn.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sumitomo Bank to set up
securities brokerage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sumitomo Bank, the world's largest lender, will join the country's other
leading banks later this week in establishing a securities brokerage.
The bank announced yesterday that it had received approval from Japan's
ministry of finance for the wholly-owned subsidiary to begin trading on
November 24.
Last month, the MoF sanctioned plans for the other banks to establish their
broking units, but withheld approval from Sumitomo because of a disagreement
with the bank over the proposed name of its subsidiary.
Sumitomo had wanted to call it Sumigin, an abbreviation of the bank's
Japanese name.
But the ministry objected to the use of the Chinese character 'gin' in the
title - a character that forms part of the word for 'bank'.
The authorities intend to maintain distinctions between the banks and their
brokerage operations, and objected to the transparent similarity between the
name of the bank and its subsidiary. Sumitomo has now agreed to call the
company Sumitomo Capital Securities.
The banks' long-awaited arrival in the brokerage business is likely to cause
significant upheaval in Japan's financial sector.
In order to protect the existing brokers, the activities of the banks'
subsidiaries will, for the time being, be tightly circumscribed. They will
not immediately be allowed to trade equities - the principal market - but
will be confined to the growing business of corporate bond issuance.
Nevertheless, companies like Sumitomo Capital Securities, backed with
substantial capital from their parents, are likely to make large inroads
into the market share of the brokers, who are already hard-pressed by the
chronic weakness in Japan's equity market.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: TWA reduces net losses to
Dollars 8m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to avert a financial crisis,
yesterday reported that cost-cutting had enabled it to reduce net losses in
its third quarter to Dollars 8m from Dollars 61.7m.
However, Mr Robert Peiser, chief financial officer, said it was still
'crucial' that the company should win approval for the sweeping financial
restructuring plan that it put to creditors last month.
TWA, once one of the world's best-known airlines, went into Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in 1992. It emerged in November 1993, but has not
reported a net profit since.
At its annual meeting yesterday in St Louis, Missouri, TWA told shareholders
that it had turned the comparable period's operating losses of Dollars 34.5m
into operating profits of Dollars 33.8m this time - the first operating
profit recorded by the company since the third quarter of 1990.
Mr Jeffrey Erickson, chief executive, said cost-cutting and productivity
improvements were behind the turnround.
Unit costs, expressed in cents per available seat mile, had fallen to 8.66
cents from 9.23 cents in the comparable period.
However, Mr Erickson said the company was still being dragged down by the
cost of servicing its debts. Interest expense was Dollars 49m in the last
quarter alone, and had totalled Dollars 146.3m so far this year.
Last month TWA announced a rescue plan under which creditors were asked to
swap Dollars 800m of the company's Dollars 1.8bn worth of debt for new
equity.
If the rescue plan succeeds, TWA believes it will be able to survive the
lean winter months and return to profitability next year.
However, many creditors believe they would get a poor deal under the
restructuring plan and are threatening to oppose it.
If the plan fails, TWA will quickly run out of cash and will almost
certainly have to file for some form of bankruptcy protection again.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Strong North American demand for natural gas and gas liquids and the
addition of oil production from the North Sea and Indonesia lifted Talisman
Energy's net profit at nine months to CDollars 44.1m (USDollars 32.7m), or
61 cents a share, from CDollars 19.2m, or 33 cents, a year ago, on revenues
of CDollars 387m against CDollars 219m, writes Robert Gibbens.
Third-quarter net profit was CDollars 15.2m, or 18 cents, up from CDollars
4.3m, or 7 cents, on revenues of CDollars 166m against CDollars 94m.
Talisman, formerly BP Canada, said the acquisition earlier this year of Bow
Valley Industries - previously controlled by British Gas - would provide 'an
attractive rate of growth for the next five years or more'.

Group profit at Preussag, the German industrial group, was 'clearly higher'
in the fiscal year ended September 30 than in the previous fiscal year, Mr
Michael Frenzel, chairman, said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Berlin. He
said group order inflows had risen by 'around 4 per cent', and that order
backlogs as of September 30 were 12 per cent higher than those of a year
earlier. He attributed the gain in orders to growth at Preussag's
shipbuilding and plant-engineering operations.
He added that restructuring at the group's troubled Hagenuk
telecommunications unit should be completed by the end of fiscal 1994-95.

company in one piece

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bolivia has decided to sell its state oil company Yacimiento Petroliferos
Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) as one single company rather than splitting it
up, Mr Fernando Cossio, finance minister, said, Reuter reports.
'We are going to sell the company as a whole. We think the best solution is
to offer it complete,' Mr Cossio said.
The sale of the oil company is part of an ambitious programme of
privatisation which Bolivia has just launched. It plans to sell leading
state companies, including the oil group, by the summer of 1995, while 75
small and medium sized businesses will be sold by December 1995, he said.
State electricity firm Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) is to be sold
first, probably in April, Mr Cossio said.

Visa International yesterday signed a consultancy agreement with Jitong
Communications to help extend China's 'Golden Card' national payments and
credit-clearing system, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
Mr Lindsay Pyne, president of Visa International Asia Pacific, said that the
two sides would collaborate in speeding the establishment of a national
payments infrastructure.
Visa would use its relationship with seven of China's specialised banks to
assist Jitong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the ministry of electronics
industry, to promote its Golden Card.
Officials said Visa would not take an equity stake in the project at this
stage, but it would 'assist in introducing advanced technology and software
for identifying counterfeit activities and for solving problems in linking
regional and international networks'.
Jitong launched its Golden Card pilot project last year. Other participants
include IBM and the China Great Wall Computer Group.

<TEXT>
Tandem Computers of the US has reached a preliminary agreement to
collaborate with Open Market, a software company, in the emerging market for
electronic commerce on the Internet, a global computer information network.
Tandem sees electronic commerce as a significant new market opportunity.
Open Market, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has developed software that
enables companies to establish and manage on-line shopping services.
Electronic commerce is expected to substantially reduce the paperwork
involved in corporate purchasing - currently estimated at more than 2.7bn
pages daily. It also offers new ways to reach mass markets of consumers.
The Internet has more than 25m users and is estimated to be growing at a
rate of two to three million new users a month.
On-line shopping will generate about Dollars 4.8bn a year by 1998, Forrester
Research, a US market research firm, predicts. Growth will be driven by the
proliferation of home computers and by improvements in on-line product
presentation, it says.
Also boosting growth is the expanding use of commercial on-line computer
information and communications services such as Prodigy, America Online and
Compuserve.

disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors of the US, the world's biggest industrial company, is to make
drastic changes in the way it conducts annual meetings in an attempt to
quell the disruption caused by dissident shareholders and hecklers.
It plans to limit the amount of speaking time allotted to each shareholder
and focus the annual meeting on formal business such as the election of
directors and votes on company and stockholder proposals.
GM, which has recently held its annual meetings in cities where it has
plants, will also eliminate ancillary events such as shareholder lunches,
plant tours and a chance to test drive new GM cars and trucks.
Mr John Smale, GM chairman, said the de-emphasis of the annual meeting would
be accompanied by the creation of new regional forums that would be held in
13 cities between now and March next year.
These forums would coincide with local motor shows and would be attended by
GM executives who would be on hand to answer shareholders' questions.
In a speech to the National Association of Corporate Directors in Washington
DC, Mr Smale said surveys showed that GM shareholders felt the company's
annual meetings were not an effective method of communicating with them.
'A principal reason, they tell us, is the disproportionate and disruptive
impact of a small number of shareholders who take an unreasonable amount of
the time to pursue largely personal agendas,' Mr Smale said.
At each year's annual meeting, GM has to contend with several shareholders
who consume much of the meeting's question-and-answer period.

<TEXT>
Laidlaw, the Ontario-based waste services and transportation group, expects
to become North America's biggest hazardous waste operator with a proposed
deal to acquire a subsidiary of Union Pacific, the US railroad conglomerate.
Laidlaw has signed an exclusive agreement with Union Pacific to negotiate
the purchase of United States Pollution Control, which operates several
landfills, service centres and other hazardous waste facilities in the
western US.
The purchase price is expected to be about USDollars 225m, plus unspecified
financial and environmental obligations. Laidlaw's board is due to approve
the deal in mid-November, and regulatory approvals should be completed by
early next year.
Laidlaw said the addition of US Pollution would lift its hazardous-waste
revenues to more than Dollars 800m a year.
The hazardous waste business has been marked by fierce competition and
tightening environmental rules. However, Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive,
said 'these assets will make us an even stronger competitor in a rapidly
consolidating market place'.
Mr Bullock said US Pollution would expand Laidlaw's geographic coverage and
provide facilities for incineration of solid hazardous waste.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: S&amp;P cuts Salomon debt rating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded the
debt of Salomon Inc, a week after the group's Salomon Brothers securities
broking unit reported its second con-secutive quarter of heavy losses.
The downgrading of Salomon's senior debt rating, from single A minus to
triple B plus, will make it more expensive for Salomon to raise funds in the
capital markets, because issuers with lower ratings have to offer higher
yields to convince investors to buy their debt.
'The immediate effect is a higher cost of funding for Salomon,' said Mr
Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in New
York.
The loss of an A rating will also shrink the pool of potential buyers of
Salomon's debt, because some institutions do not invest in securities listed
below an A rating.
S&amp;P also lowered its ratings on Salomon's subordinated debt and preferred
stock, but left its ratings on the group's commercial paper unchanged.
Explaining its decision, the agency said: 'Salomon's earnings in the current
market downturn have been substantially weaker than that of other
institutional firms, as the firm lost Dollars 247m in the first nine months
of this year.'
S&amp;P also said it was concerned that, in unfavourable market conditions,
Salomon's volatile trading operations - where most of the losses this year
have been incurred - exposed it to 'additional weak performance'.
Salomon responded to S&amp;P's move by saying that it was confident of its
earnings potential. It also said that it would continue to monitor expenses
closely, and would maintain 'a flexible, responsive attitude toward its
business opportunities'.

Two US regulators are investigating allegations that Bankers Trust misled
Procter &amp; Gamble over the sale of a complex derivative instrument, in a case
which could mark the first extension of the watchdogs' jurisdiction over
derivative markets.
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which overseas US securities
markets, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates
futures trading, are both understood to be investigating the matter,
although neither agency would confirm their interest.
The investigations follow P&amp;G's move last week to sue Bankers Trust for more
than Dollars 130m over an interest rate swap contract it entered into last
year. The bank also faces a lawsuit from Gibson Greetings, which alleges it
was misled by the bank over a swap it bought.
Swaps, under which two parties agree to exchange payments in the future
based on the movements in some underlying instruments or markets, are not
classified as securities and so do not fall under the SEC's jurisdiction.
Also, the CFTC in January last year explicitly extended an exemption for
swaps from its regulations, although the instruments still fall under the
broad anti-fraud provisions of the legislation under which the CFTC
operates.
Mr Simon Lorne, the SEC's general counsel, indicated yesterday that some
swaps may fall within the agency's jurisdiction, adding: 'As some of them
have become more exotic, with more different elements embedded in them,
these questions become more difficult to answer.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Pfizer to buy cardiology
equipment manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, has announced that it is buying a
specialist manufacturer of hospital cardiology equipment in an all-stock
deal valued at Dollars 158m.
The purchase will give Pfizer a dominant position in the market for such
equipment, and reflects the consolidation under way in the US healthcare
sector.
Faced with pressure from hospitals and other buyers for lower prices, most
healthcare companies have come to focus on market share as their primary
short-term goal.
Namic USA, based in Glen Falls, New York, reported after-tax profits of
Dollars 5m on sales of Dollars 57m in its last fiscal year, which ended on
May 31.
The company claims to hold around two-thirds of the US market for equipment
used in fluid administration, waste containment and pressure monitoring
during angio-plasty.
Namic said it also accounts for about 20 per cent of the European market for
this equipment and that the acquisition by Pfizer would increase its ability
to expand in European markets.
Pfizer's own subsidiary which makes cardiology equipment, Schneider,
accounted for just under 15 per cent of the Dollars 1bn sales generated by
its hospital supplies operations in 1993.

Biogen, the US genetic-engineering concern, said it was stopping development
of one of its two most promising experimental drugs.
The decision represents a blow to the company's efforts to become a fully
integrated drug manufacturer.
The company said it had decided it would no longer pursue efforts to market
an anticoagulant known as Hirulog, which is made from a chemical produced by
leeches.
Biogen, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it would take a
Dollars 25m pre-tax charge in the third quarter to cover expenses related to

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Oppenheimers like to keep
business in the family - The question of management succession is occupying
minds at Anglo American
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Harry Oppenheimer, doyen of South African industrialists, celebrated his
86th birthday last week. He is becoming a little more hard of hearing, a
little more frail, but he still prefers to pour the champagne himself for
luncheon guests at his home, Brenthurst, in Johannesburg.
He complains, very gently, about the vindictiveness of the National Party
government which did not like his vocal disapproval of apartheid. The
government saw to it that a main highway was built at the bottom of his
garden and also a large hospital was put up on the hill overlooking his
front door. 'It is very noisy,' Mr Oppenheimer complains. 'I don't think
Nicky (his son, Nicholas) will want to live here.'
There is a more important question about Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer. Some
observers wonder if he has the ambition or the ability to step into his
father's shoes when the time comes.
The Oppenheimers in effect control Anglo American Corporation - South
Africa's biggest group and the world's leading gold producer - as well as
its closely-bound sister companies De Beers, the world's largest diamond
company, and Minorco, which is responsible for many of the group's
non-diamond interests outside South Africa. Between them these three
represent a stock market value of about Dollars 27bn.
The question of management succession at Anglo is increasingly relevant now
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of all three companies, has reached the
age of 61. Given his tremendous executive burden, analysts are asking when
will Mr Ogilvie Thompson retire and who will replace him?
Some suggest jokingly he is the only person apart from Mr Harry Oppenheimer
who understands the group's immensely complex structure. Not that 'JOT', as
he is known at Anglo's Main Street headquarters, believes it is particularly
complex. At a recent presentation he pointed to the chart (see above -
values have risen since) and said, without the slightest hint of irony,
'Many people believe we have a rather complicated structure. We do not
believe this is so.'
Yet there is no sense that Anglo is self-satisfied or resting on its
laurels. Mr Ogilvie Thompson is leading the group through one of its most
dynamic phases.
Its financial strength is enabling Anglo to expand in several directions at
once: there is a R1.7bn (Dollars 485m) Moab extension to the deep level Vaal
Reefs gold mine; a R1.4bn project to develop one of the world's biggest
mineral sands operations at Namakwa Sands in the North West Cape; a 50 per
cent stake in the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel project, which will become
the world's third-largest producer; and a R1. lbn investment to expand coal
production.
There is also an unspecified sum to be spent to double the size of the
newest acquisition, Del Monte Foods International, which cost R726m. Through
Minorco the group is investing Pounds 300m (Dollars 490m) in a plant at
Aylesford in the UK to produce newsprint from recycled waste paper, while De
Beers is expanding its jointly-owned diamond operations in Botswana as well
as those off the coast of Namibia.
At Mr Ogilvie Thompson's instigation, Anglo has also been tidying up its
structure. However, under his chairmanship, Anglo has eschewed fashionable
'unbundling'. Small countries such as South Africa, Sweden and the
Netherlands need large companies to carry the flag internationally, he
insists, and, obviously, such companies will dominate the domestic economy.
Neither will he consider splitting up his three chairmanships. Having
separate chairmen for each company when the companies are so closely tied
would produce enormous problems, not the least of which would be
personality, he insists.
As for when Mr Ogilvie Thompson will retire, the Oppenheimers let it be
known inside the group recently that they hoped he would continue his
tripartite role 'well beyond the year 2000'.
Nobody at Anglo's headquarters questions that decision. Mr Harry Oppenheimer
retired as chairman as long ago as 1982, but the men he left in control were
all hand-picked by him and all regularly consult him on company policy.
When he is in Johannesburg or London, he still shows up every day at the
Anglo offices. 'Although I retired some time ago, they still sometimes ask
for my advice,' he says disarmingly. But it is clear to any visitor to Main
Street that no big decision is taken without his nod of approval.
To this extent Anglo still feels very much like a family business, even
though the Oppenheimers own only about 8 per cent of it.
Mr Harry Oppenheimer sees nothing wrong with family companies. He points out
that nearly all his family's wealth is tied up in Anglo and Minorco. 'If you
are in that position, people in your organisation know that you are likely
to be very careful about the interests of shareholders and not only about
the interests of managers.'
It would seem a foregone conclusion that Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, now 49, would
eventually follow JOT into the three chairmanships - except for his apparent
shyness and reluctance to move into the limelight.
He obviously enjoys the diamond business, particularly meeting the traders,
who also usually represent family companies.
But he shows little obvious enthusiasm for some other parts of the empire,
even though he diligently does all the paper work required.
However, those close to Mr Nicky Oppenheimer say that, when the time comes,
he will take over. Mr Leslie Boyd, the Anglo director responsible for the
industrial operations, points out that similar doubts were expressed about
Mr Harry Oppenheimer when Sir Ernest, Harry's father who founded the group
in 1917, died in 1957.
Mr Harry then seemed more interested in his political work - he was MP for
Kimberley - than in his career at Anglo. Yet he immediately resigned his
parliamentary seat and gave his full attention to the family company.
Mr Boyd suggests: 'Nicky will do as his father did - take his place and then
make sure he has a team of highly effective, professional managers around
him to run the business.'

The vendors of two large timber companies to be acquired by Malaysia's

Commission on the proposed sale, a Berjaya Textiles statement said, Reuter
reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Berjaya Textiles is buying Sarawak-based Jaya Tiasa Plywood and Rimbunan
Hijau Plywood with shares, which would result in a reverse takeover of
Berjaya Textiles by Malaysian timber tycoon Mr Tiong Hiew King and his
associates. The commission, in approving the deal earlier, had slashed the
price tag of both companies.
It cut the proposed price of MDollars 1.04bn (USDollars 406m) for the
acquisition of Jaya Tiasa to MDollars 730m, while the price for Rimbunan
Hijau was reduced to MDollars 107m from MDollars 143.69m.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cigna sells reinsurance business
to cut losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cigna, the US insurer, is withdrawing from the reinsurance business as part
of an attempt to turn round its loss-making property/casualty insurance
operations.
With premiums of Dollars 507m last year, Cigna was among the top 30
reinsurers worldwide.
The company is selling its international reinsurance business, which
generated premiums of Dollars 270m in 1993; transfering its US agricultural
insurance operations, with Dollars 100m of premiums, to its domestic
property/casualty insurer; and closing the rest of the US reinsurance
operations, which had premiums of Dollars 150m.
Its departure from the business echoes moves by other US insurers to reduce
their exposure to property/casualty losses in the wake of big catastrophe
and pollution claims. Prudential Insurance announced plans last year to sell
its own reinsurance company, Prudential Re.
Cigna, which does not publish separate results for its loss-making
reinsurance business, said its overall property/casualty insurance
operations, which include reinsurance, lost Dollars 69m in the third quarter
and Dollars 216m in the nine months to September.
The company closed down its UK reinsurance business two years ago, but
continued to take run-off losses on this business of Dollars 10m last year.
Cigna is selling its reinsurance business in Europe, south-east Asia and
Latin America to St Paul, and its business in Japan and Korea to Employers
Re.
The company reported overall third-quarter net income of Dollars 123m, or
Dollars 1.70 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, a year ago. The latest figures reflect a Dollars 9m charge and
Dollars 26m of additional reserves to reflect the withdrawal from
reinsurance.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Study reveals larger PC market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world personal computer market is significantly larger than previously
estimated, according to a new market study. The latest PC product
announcements also point to rapid expansion in the consumer segment of the
business.
Computer Intelligence InfoCorp, a leading PC market research firm, now
estimates that 43.8m PCs were shipped in 1993, an increase of 6.9m units
over its previous estimates. CII's forecast for 1994 sales is 49.4m units, a
rise of 7.5m.
Small manufacturers, who typically build PCs to order, have been largely
overlooked in prior estimates, CII said.
'The so-called clone-shops are the forgotten many and represent an important
role in the distribution of PC systems. Our data show that the majority (59
per cent) of computer dealers and retail computer stores carry non-branded
PCs,' said Mr Dan Ness, director of microsystems research at CII.
Intel, the leading supplier of microprocessors to the PC industry, said the
new CII numbers were a more accurate reflection of the overall size of the
PC market.
Another important PC market trend is the growth of consumer sales. About
one-third of all PC sales in the US last year were to consumers or
businesses with five or fewer employees, according to market researchers.
This year, the consumer segment is expected to be closer to 50 per cent of
all US PC sales.
Digital Equipment yesterday became the latest PC manufacturer to focus on
this high-growth segment, with the introduction of new models aimed at the
US retail market.
Taking an approach similar to that of market leaders Compaq, Packard Bell
and IBM, Digital has developed PCs pre-loaded with software that enables
buyers to set up the computer in 15 minutes or less.
In a separate PC industry development that promises broader availability of
software applications, IBM and Hughes Network Systems yesterday announced a
partnership to deliver software to retailers and corporate customers via
satellite transmission.

dividend since 1990

<TEXT>
Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, yesterday said the
country's four-year banking crisis was over. The bank also said it expected
to pay its first dividend since being formed out of a merger in 1990,
following a strong performance during the year.
Nine-month pre-tax profits almost trebled to nearly NKr2bn (Dollars 305.3m)
from NKr720m last year. The bank benefited from a sharp improvement in
non-performing loans and a reversal in loan losses, as a result of a marked
improvement in the domestic economy.
The volume of non-performing loans plunged NKr3bn to NKr7.2bn since the
start of the year, with one-third of the decline occurring in the third
quarter.
'In light of this performance, the bank expects to be in a position to
declare a dividend for 1994,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing
director.
The bank's continued improvement was curbed by a reduction in gains on
shares, bonds and foreign currency following rising domestic interest rates.
Last year, the bank benefited from declining rates.
Net interest income declined NKr368m to NKr3.6bn but the reduction of
non-performing and doubtful loans cut interest expenses by NKr268m.
Other operating income - from securities, bonds, foreign exchange and other
financial instruments - fell NKr987m to NKr1.7bn. Nevertheless, the bank's
result was helped by a gain of NKr147m due to lower than expected loan
losses. This compared with loan losses of NKr2.5bn last year.
The bank said the volume of doubtful loans had been cut by NKr1bn since the
end of 1993.
DnB said a NKr37m rise to NKr3.4bn in operating expenses partly reflected an
increase in statutory guarantee fund contributions to NKr189m from NKr120m
but that personnel expenses were cut by NKr48m to NKr1.65bn.

Mr Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old partner at Lazard Freres, the merchant
bank, is likely to become the next head of Generale des Eaux, the French
utilities and communications group. His appointment is expected to be
announced within the next few weeks.
The appointment comes at the recommendation of Mr Guy Dejouany, the
73-year-old chairman who is due to retire shortly from his post.
However, the move will require ratification at a forthcoming meeting of the
board of directors.
The change partly reflects a desire by the group for a more youthful
management.
Mr Messier is a member of the Inspecteurs des Finances, the elite French
administrative corps, and advised the government on its privatisation
programme before joining the private sector.
Shares in the group rose slightly at the end of last week following
speculation in the French press of Mr Messier's appointment.
The group last month reported net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 244.2m), up
5.4 per cent, in the first half of the year.

Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive at Bikuben, Denmark's third-largest
bank, is resigning next year, 18 months ahead of his normal retirement date.
He will be replaced by Mr Henrik Thufason, currently managing director of
the savings bank's data centre.
Mr Ebbesen's resignation statement coincided with the publication of a
three-year development plan for Bikuben, the country's premier savings bank.
The bank aims to increase its core earnings (operating earnings excluding
unrealised gains and losses on securities) to DKr750m (Dollars 127.1m) in
1997. This compares with a DKr1.2bn loss in 1993, when the bank carried loss
provisions of DKr2.69bn, about 4.7 per cent of outstanding loans and
guarantees.
In the first half of this year, a cut in provisions to DKr532m from
DKr1.68bn in 1993 enabled the bank to report core banking profits of
DKr229m, but heavy unrealised losses on the bond and share portfolio meant
it reported a first-half net loss of DKr472m.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Astra pays Merck Dollars 820m
for 50% of drugs venture

<TEXT>
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday paid Dollars 820m to
Merck, the US's biggest drugs company, for 50 per cent of a joint marketing
venture.
The new company will take over marketing one of the biggest prescription
medications in the US, the anti-ulcer drug Prilosec, which had sales of
Dollars 684m in the first nine months of this year.
Until now, the drug, developed by Astra, has been sold in the US by Merck,
under a royalty agreement with the Swedish company.
The new joint venture, named Astra Merck, will also develop and market new
drugs from Astra and other companies. New gastrointestinal and
cardiovascular drugs are likely to be the first considered by the joint
venture, which could put it in direct competition with Merck.
The US group's Vasotec and Mevacor are among the country's leading
cardiovascular drugs.
Yesterday's deal follows a 1991 agreement between the Swedish and US groups,
which have co-operated in the US since 1982.
The 1991 agreement provided for Astra to buy a 50 per cent stake in a new US
joint-venture company, provided sales by Merck of Astra products reached a
certain level.
The trigger point was reached in the middle of 1993, said Dr Hakan Mogren,
president and chief executive of Astra. The purchase price equals US sales
of Astra drugs in the year since the level was reached, he added.
The new company, based in Wayne, Pennsylvania, has 900 employees and 95 per
cent of sales come from Prilosec.
Mr Wayne Yetter, Astra Merck's president and chief executive, said the
company aimed to develop new drugs before the Prilosec's patent runs out in
2001.
Prilosec sales had not been hit by the US patent expiry of another ulcer
drug, Tagamet, in April, which was followed by the launch of a cheaper form
of the drug, Mr Yetter said.
Prilosec acts by stopping the creation of the acid which causes ulcers,
unlike Tagamet or another rival, Zantac, which suppress the secretion of the
acid, Astra Merck said. Prilosec is used in acute ulcer cases, and
prescription volumes have remained constant, the company added.
Dr Mogren said the goodwill associated with the deal would be written off in
Astra's accounts over a period of 20 years, and that over the next two years
the Swedish company's share of profits from the joint venture would roughly
equal the royalties it received from Merck.
He said the profits would grow as the joint venture developed.
Astra will continue to operate through its US subsidiary, which handles a
number of anti-allergy and hospital products.

Nycomed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
saw nine-month pre-tax profits slip to NKr1.01bn (Dollars 155.3m) from
NKr1.18bn. The decline was due to reversals in the securities portfolio and
higher interest expenses.
Group sales, including royalties, rose to NKr5.3bn from NKr4.7bn while
operating profit was unchanged at NKr1.5bn.
Net financial items during the period were a charge of NKr132m, against
income of NKr35m last year.
Interest expenses shot up to NKr105m from NKr63m but foreign currency losses
were cut to NKr34m from NKr50m. The group suffered losses on securities of
NKr8m, compared with gains of NKr153m last year.
Nycomed Imaging's sales slipped to NKr1.89bn from NKr1.92bn with operating
profit declining to NKr1.15bn from NKr1.2bn due to increased competition and
pressure on prices.
Nycomed Pharma improved sales to NKr2.5bn from NKr2.3bn. Its operating
profit rose to NKr467m from NKr369m on the back of positive developments in
the Nordic and Benelux markets.

FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sales growth helps turnround at
DSM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand fuelled by European economic recovery enabled DSM, the Dutch
chemicals group, to stage a turnround to a net profit of Fl 114m (Dollars
67.4m) in the third quarter, from a net loss of Fl 52m in the same period of
1993.
The sharp improvement was caused mainly by a 13 per cent rise in sales
volumes, particularly for polymers and caprolactam, a raw material used to
make nylon.
Turnover rose 13 per cent, to Fl 2.15bn from Fl 1.90bn.
Selling prices rose by an average 2 per cent, but this was offset by the
negative effects of divestments and by lower exchange rates, particularly
for the dollar.
The buoyant demand for polymers and other DSM products kept the group's
plants operating at high utilisation rates, the company said.
The unusually good results in the third quarter, which is traditionally a
weak period because of the summer holidays and slacker production at DSM's
industrial customers, took net profit for the first nine months of the year
to Fl 295m.
This compares with a net loss of Fl 42m a year earlier. Nine-month turnover
was up 8.7 per cent at Fl 6.63bn from nearly Fl 6.1bn in the first quarters
of 1993.
The result was in line with forecasts by analysts, who had predicted a net
result above Fl 100m for the quarter.
DSM forecast that sales volumes would remain strong in the final quarter,
while selling prices and margins should also be higher on average than in
the third quarter.
This is expected to lead to a further increase in fourth-quarter net profit,
before extraordinary items, compared with the third quarter, in spite of the
prospect of significant maintenance shutdowns.
Mr Simon de Bree, chairman, said the lower dollar trend was a cause for
concern, but added this was not expected to have any significant negative
effect in the short term.

Siemens, the German industrial group, plans to invest more than Dollars
3.5bn in infrastructure projects in the Asia-Pacific region by 2000, Reuter
reports from Singapore.
'There is an enormous need for infrastructure goods in the (Asia-Pacific)
region,' Mr Heinrich von Pierer, president and chief executive, said after
the company's first corporate executive committee meeting outside Germany.
He said more than Dollars 1bn of the planned investment would be spent in
China, and between Dollars 500m and Dollars 1bn invested in India.
The proposed projects include power generation, telecommunications,
transport systems, industrial automation and medical engineering.
Mr von Pierer said preliminary figures for the fiscal year to end-September
1994 showed the Asia-Pacific region contributed almost Dollars 7bn in new
orders and Dollars 5bn in sales. 'This marks a 10 per cent increase over the
previous year.
'While continuing to expand in our home market of Europe and in the
Americas, we will consequently develop the Asia-Pacific region as our third
regional pillar,' he said.
He said the group aimed to more than double business volume in the area by
2000.

nine-month result
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Aga jumped 8 per cent yesterday after the Swedish industrial gas
group announced a stronger-than-expected 23 per cent increase in profits in
the first nine months.
Profits after financial items amounted to SKr1.18bn (Dollars 163.9m),
compared with SKr964m in the same 1993 period, after sales increased 10 per
cent to SKr9.21bn.
The company upgraded its full-year forecast, saying it expected profits to
be 20 per cent higher than last year's SKr1.36bn. The group's A shares rose
SKr5.5 to close at SKr73.5.
The figures have been adjusted to exclude Frigoscandia, the world's leading
cold storage chain which Aga demerged earlier this year to concentrate on
its core businesses.
At the operating level, income rose 15 per cent to SKr1.2bn due to economic
improvement, rising demand for industrial gases, and rationalisation. Aga
benefited from economic stabilisation in Brazil, which brought good
third-quarter earnings for its unit there.
The company saw a reduction in net financial costs to SKr162m from SKr195m
while its 34 per cent share of income from Gullspangs, the power company,
rose to SKr132m from SKr113m.
The group's third-quarter performance was much stronger than a year ago,
with income after financial items climbing 56 per cent to SKr398m even
though sales were only 7 per cent higher at SKr3.13bn.
Investments in new plant and equipment jumped to SKr1.2bn in the first nine
months from SKr980m in the same 1993 period. The biggest projects were air
gas plants in Finland, Norway, Germany, Chile and Mexico.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Diversifying out of lumpiness - Vosper
Thornycroft, the boat builder in the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle between British Aerospace and GEC for control of VSEL, the
Cumbria-based submarine maker, is causing some irritation in the boardroom
of Vosper Thornycroft.
For the Southampton-based boat builder believes the takeover struggle has
overshadowed the fact that Britain still has a warship company on the south
coast - in addition to VSEL's Barrow yard and GEC's facilities at Yarrow on
the Clyde.
And just to underline the point, Mr Martin Jay, chief executive, last week
had marks drawn on the floor of the main construction shed at Portsmouth,
showing it could accommodate vessels up to 6,000 tonnes.
Vosper was being referred to solely as a builder of glass reinforced plastic
(GRP) minehunters, corvettes and patrol craft, said Mr Jay.
These do indeed comprise the bulk of the 180 vessels which the yard has sold
over the past 25 years to 30 navies around the world, but Vosper emphasises
that it can also make steel ships up to the size of a frigate.
With net cash of about Pounds 200m, Mr Jay said Vosper had the financial
strength to bond any of the projects in the current naval procurement
programme for surface ships. Despite having an order book worth Pounds 600m
and 14 vessels currently under construction, Vosper still has plenty of
capacity.
Mr Jay said Vosper would also bid for vessels such as the new Royal Navy
landing platform dock assault ship, which would be too big for the
Southampton yard. If successful, the group would become prime contractor,
but have the construction done elsewhere.
Although Vosper made no steel ships between 1988-92, it has recently
invested Pounds 10m in a new module hall for steelwork construction and
fitting. A laser cutting machine is linked by fibre optics to the yard's
computer-aided design system, which has helped push up productivity and
improve the quality and finish of individual components.
In spite of this investment and ambitious bidding plans, Vosper is also keen
to build up the non-warship aspects of the group. These account for about 20
per cent of sales, compared with only 5 per cent two years ago. The chief
executive said he would like to increase this proportion to between 30 and
40 per cent over the next two or three years.
Vosper's main priority is to win more business which is both small in scale
and reliable, to help offset the unpredictable swings of warship orders. Mr
Jay said: 'To talk of diversifying out of defence is to miss the point -
we're diversifying out of lumpiness.'
Many of Vosper's diversification opportunities flow directly from its link
to warships and the world's navies. As part of the training and support
service offered with its vessels, the group runs a maritime training centre
at Portchester, near Portsmouth, which can accommodate 300 people.
Some trainees come from HM Customs and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, but most
serve in the Middle Eastern navies which are Vosper's main customers. This
has led the company to establish an adjacent Arabic school for their
children, which can accommodate 70 pupils.
The maritime centre has developed computer-based training for naval
personnel, which is much cheaper than simulators. Its expertise at writing
software has been utilised to devise a training scheme for British Rail
maintenance engineers, which will be used in BR depots throughout the
country. The centre will also soon take delivery of a new armoured vehicle
from GKN, the engineering group, to train personnel from a Middle Eastern
country.
Vosper's biggest opportunity to diversify is probably offered by the
government's market-testing initiative. Mr George Cameron, managing director
of Vosper's systems, said the group could be bidding for contracts worth up
to Pounds 1bn over the next 18 months. These include the Navy's maritime
services operation, which employs nearly 2,000 people and operates 200
support vessels - such as tugs and lighters.
Vosper recently won a three-year contract for the Ministry of Defence's
Record Data Centre, which records all the parts and plans for the Royal
Navy's surface ships on computer and fiche. It also has a five-year contract
to operate marine services craft in support of the RAF.
Back at the Southampton yard, Mr Mike Davidson, managing director of
engineering services, said: 'We are looking outside to see what we can do
with our existing facilities for industries other than shipbuilding.'
So far the group has identified the nuclear and transport industries as
potential customers. It has built a fuel-rod handling machine and fuel store
for BNFL at Thorp and is also making GRP bumpers, under licence, for trams
in Strasbourg.
Having acquired a few business for about Pounds 1m each, Vosper said
recently it was prepared to buy one or more companies at about the Pounds
20m level to increase the pace of its diversification.
The biggest deal to date was the Pounds 8.6m purchase in April of HSDE, a
maker of electronic control and monitoring systems.
Vosper was sold by British Shipbuilders to a management team in 1985 for
Pounds 18.5m and came back to the market in 1988, valued at Pounds 49m. Its
current market value of Pounds 236m reflects the uprating which the shares
have enjoyed in the last three years, due mainly to the group's strong
export position.
About 95 per cent of Vosper's warship orders are exported and the group's
focus on minehunters and patrol craft - selling to the Middle East and east
Asia - has insulated it to a large extent from the downturn in defence
spending by former cold warriors.
Such a strong export order book might well be attractive to BAe - or even
GEC - as the UK defence sector enters what could prove its final phase of
consolidation. However, Vosper shares trade on a comfortable premium to the
market and the company would prove an expensive proposition to predators.
Mr Jay said: 'We've done well in recent years as an independent company and
it's our strategy to remain so.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Former chief executive sues NFC for Pounds
1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sherlock, former chief executive of NFC, the transport and
logistics group, is suing the company for Pounds 1.3m compensation for loss
of office.
Mr Sherlock left the group in August after only 18 months in the job,
apparently because of a clash of management style with the 'old guard' of
management.
He was on a three-year rolling contract which included a salary payment of
Pounds 254,000 in 1993 and a pension contribution of Pounds 82,000.
The claim for Pounds 1.3m is understood to be higher than he could have
expected under his contract.
NFC confirmed that it had received a writ from Mr Sherlock. This followed
unsuccessful negotiations over the level of compensation and an offer which
was rejected.
Mr Sherlock was the first outsider to be brought into NFC at top management
level. He instigated a strategic review, merging two of its largest
subsidiaries and announcing plans to focus on more profitable lines of
business. But investors were disappointed at the pace of change.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Scotia has high expectations of OTC calcium
supplement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotia Holdings yesterday became the latest biotechnology company to hail
the potential of a new treatment developed using funds from its recent
flotation.
The company, which raised Pounds 37m when it came to the market last
October, said Efacal - its over-the-counter calcium supplement - would prove
an effective remedy for osteoporosis in a global market worth an estimated
Pounds 50m a year.
It also has high hopes for EF40, its single-compound prescription treatment
for the illness, which could exploit a market put at Pounds 300m if clinical
trials prove successful.
Mr David Horrobin, chief executive, warned the drug could cost another
Pounds 5m before it reached launch stage - at least five years from now.
Scotia's announcement followed claims on Monday from British Biotechnology,
one of the sector's leading companies, that its new cancer treatment had
shown promise in first clinical trials.
Celltech, another rival, said last week it had made a breakthrough in Phase
Two trials for its latest anti-arthritis drug.
Such statements have helped lift the share price of all three companies,
with Scotia closing up 3p at 263p.
The industry, however, has been unsettled in recent weeks by US
biotechnology companies reporting the failure of drugs in the latest stages
of clinical development, which is supposed to involve the least risk.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Celsis deeper in red after heavy research
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Celsis International, the biotechnology company which raised Pounds 12.4m
from its flotation last year, reported sharply increased first half losses
following a threefold rise in research spending.
The specialist manufacturer of contamination detection equipment endured
pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 561,000), as research and development
costs rose from Pounds 307,000 to Pounds 963,000 in the six months to
September 30.
Heavy spending on new products - used mainly for testing food, cosmetics and
drugs - helped drain the group's cash balances, which fell from Pounds 12.3m
to Pounds 8.63m.
While reluctant to give an annualised figure for rate at which it uses
reserves, Mr Mark Clement, finance director, said the group used up Pounds
650,000 last month.
Mr Clement however, sought to distance itself from other biotechnology
companies faced with the challenge of clinical trials by pointing out that
its products were either already available or close to launch.
Sales of existing products helped lift turnover from Pounds 79,000 to Pounds
302,000 while gross profits reached Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 63,000).
Although losses per share rose from 1.05p to 3.7p, the company is expected
to move into profit by 1997.
Predicting a sharp growth in demand for the group's products, Mr Arthur
Holden, chief executive, said it could capture a sizeable slice of a market
likely to be worth Dollars 7.99bn (Pounds 5.05bn) by the end of the decade.
'Most of our competitors are small, under-capitalised, one-technology
companies. We can exploit an under-developed market.'
It has signed collaborative deals with companies such as Wellcome, Merck and
Colgate Palmolive for equipment designed to reduce manufacturing costs by
speeding up the testing process.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon fails to sell Travers and US
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Huntingdon International Holdings fell 21p to 44p yesterday after
the life sciences group announced it had failed to sell Travers Morgan, its
UK-based consultancy, and its engineering and environmental services
business in the US.
Huntingdon said the annual results, to be published in December, were
expected to suffer from the costs of the abortive sales and provisions to
turn the businesses round. One analyst said that was likely to send the
group into the red.
In May the group announced that it planned to focus on its life sciences
business, having concluded that the other divisions did not have the
earnings prospects originally envisaged. It called in Kleinwort Benson, the
investment bank, to help with the sale of the businesses. But no purchase
could be concluded, forcing the management to consider other options.
Mr Christopher Cliffe, deputy executive chairman, described the news as
'very disappointing'. He said Huntingdon was making a huge effort to return
both groups to profitability. This would include the closure and sale of
offices and job losses.
Travers Morgan is an international consulting firm specialising in
engineering, management, transport and environment with a workforce of 850.
Its profits fell from Pounds 1.23m to Pounds 343,000 in the six months to
June. The US businesses employ 1,750 people and recorded an operating loss
of Pounds 388,000 in the first half.
In the nine months to June 30, group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 4.34m
to Pounds 1.26m, while revenue, net of subcontracts, fell from Pounds 115.6m
to Pounds 109.2m.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Powerscreen rises 12% to Pounds 14m -
Integration of acquisitions and tight controls boost figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Powerscreen International, the manufacturer of screening and stone crushing
equipment, reported a 12 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.6m
to Pounds 14.1m for the six months to the end of September.
Turnover advanced 41 per cent to Pounds 84m (Pounds 59.4m), including Pounds
2.98m from acquisitions. During the period, Powerscreen continued its
ambitious string of purchases, paying Pounds 17.1m for Benford from BM
Group, a manufacturer of dumpers and rollers used in the construction and
plant hire industries.
Mr Shay McKeown , chief executive, said that the improvements had been
achieved by the successful integration of its latest purchases and an
adherence to tight control measures.
'The exchange rate was against us as well, so under the circumstances we
think these are very good results,' he added.
The shares, however, fell 13p to 282p.
Operating profits in the screening division rose 12 per cent to Pounds 9.5m
(Pounds 8.5m) on turnover up 36 per cent to Pounds 40.8m, compared with
Pounds 29.9m. The figures included contributions from Simplicity Engineering
and Ludlow-Saylor bought in February.
Mr McKeown said the acquisitions had diluted profit margins but had enabled
the group to be better positioned in a larger number of markets.
Firmer UK sales in the crushing and recycling business helped profits rise 6
per cent to Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.44m) on turnover 13 per cent ahead at
Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 15.7m). European sales, however, were disappointing.
The Benford added Pounds 3m to the turnover in the materials handling
division which rose to Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 13.8m). Profits jumped 36 per
cent to Pounds 1.93m (Pounds 1.42m).
Earnings per share were up 13 per cent to 12.2p (10.8p). The interim
dividend rose 10 per cent to 2.2p (2p).
Mr McKeown said the outlook was encouraging. 'We have a strong order book
and the investments we are making should ensure continued growth.'
COMMENT
The market has replaced worries over Powerscreen's accounting policies with
more real concerns over whether the group's markets provide long-term profit
growth. Having changed its accountants, and increased its disclosures, the
group is also working hard at widening its markets, with much effort being
put into east Asian operations. Profit forecasts for the full-year are
little changed at about Pounds 28m, which gives earnings per share of 28.9p
and puts the shares on a prospective p/e of 12, a slight discount to the
market. If Powerscreen can win the market's confidence, this seems a low
rating for a company as consistent in producing profit growth.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BP up 23% to Pounds 415m on higher volumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum reported a 23 per cent increase in third quarter
replacement cost profits to Pounds 415m, with continued cost-cutting being
boosted by rising sales volumes, taking the figure for the nine months to
September 30 to Pounds 1.06bn.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said it was the best quarterly performance
since the first quarter of 1991, when crude oil prices were considerably
higher than the current range of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel for the
benchmark Brent Blend.
The shares, however, closed 9p down at 426p.
Third quarter earnings per share rose to 7.6p, compared with 6.1p in the
second quarter and 6.2p a year ago. But the quarterly dividend of 2.5p
remains unchanged.
Mr Simon said the results, which were above most analysts' expectations,
were 'pretty encouraging'. The dividend policy would be 're-considered at
the end of the fourth quarter on the basis of the full-year performance'.
Healthy net cash inflows from operating activities of Pounds 1.17bn for the
quarter and disposal proceeds of Dollars 581m (Pounds 368m) enabled the
company to cut its debt by Dollars 675m to Dollars 10.4bn at the end of the
quarter, according to Mr Steve Ahearne, finance director. Debt has been cut
by about Dollars 6bn since its peak in 1992.
Gearing fell to 60 per cent, against 70 per cent at the half-way stage. The
company is not aiming at a gearing target, according to Mr Simon, but it
still wants to see debt below the Dollars 10bn level set in 1992.
The sale of BP Nutrition earlier this year marked the end of the company's
big disposal programme of non-energy assets. The sale of some minor assets
should result in proceeds for the full year of about Dollars 1.25bn, Mr
Ahearne said.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RJ Kiln sets up 'employee trust'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAPLH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
R J Kiln, the Lloyd's agency, has taken the unusual step of setting up an
'employee trust' to own all the shares in the company on behalf of its
workers, writes Raplh Atkins.
Mr Colin Murray, chairman, said the company believed it was the first in the
City to make such a move.
The aim was 'to ensure that all those responsible for the future success of
the company should benefit from their efforts'.
Those participating in the trust will be allocated a share of profit
commissions earned during the time they are employed by the company and
possibly for a limited number of years after their retirement.
Kiln, which employs about 300 people, manages nine syndicates in the Lloyd's
of London insurance market.
Existing shareholders - mainly current or retired employees and their
families - have been offered renumeration in the form of loan stock plus a
coupon and an agreed share of profits over the next three years.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Safeland trebled to Pounds 1.09m

<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Safeland, the property trading and investment company,
more than trebled in the six months to September 30, from a restated Pounds
327,000 to Pounds 1.09m.
Turnover showed a similar increase, from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 14.6m. Mr
Ray Lipman, chairman, said the results reflected the confidence that had
returned to the market in early 1994, particularly in the residential
sector.
Trading opportunities were running 'at healthier levels than we have seen
for a number of years', he added.
Six retail investment properties were purchased during the half-year,
increasing the value of the investment portfolio from Pounds 7.06m at the
year end to Pounds 10.4m.
Net asset value per share rose to 33.5p (32p). Earnings per share came out
at 2.89p (1.05p). The interim dividend is 0.86p against 0.6p.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: De Morgan in second half loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
De Morgan Group, the property sector advice company, expects to be able to
inform shareholders about its refinancing before the end of this month. The
proposals are likely to include the raising of new equity and significant
cost savings.
In July the company said it was considering its finances following the
ending of talks about a large acquisition and fund raising, the costs of
which were about Pounds 240,000.
De Morgan also reported it had fallen into the red for the second half of
the year to April 30 and expected losses for the six months to October 31.
However, following the summer period activity had increased and the
directors thought the results would show a significant improvement in the
next few months.
For the year pre-tax profits were Pounds 11,000, against losses of Pounds
258,000, following profits of Pounds 24,000 at the halfway stage. Turnover
rose 22 per cent to Pounds 2.33m (Pounds 1.91m).
Earnings per share were 0.02p (losses 0.54p).

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Storm Group, the Nottingham-based leisure wear manufacturer, has
called in the receivers after three years of losses.
Mr Philip Baldwin, a partner at Price Waterhouse in Birmingham, said he was
reasonably optimistic about being able to find a buyer for the group, famous
for its brightly coloured all-weather clothing. Its brands include Peter
Storm, Noel Bibby, Clare Morris (UK) and Keighley Special Finishers.
'We are now opening up the books and advertising to see if there is any
interest,' he said. 'By the end of November we should have a better idea of
the situation.'
He said that in recent years the company had been hit by imports from east
Asia.
Despite an expanding market, sales had been static at between Pounds 2m and
Pounds 3m.
'This is not a large company. In fact the name is probably bigger than the
company,' Mr Baldwin said. He added that Peter Storm might have to become
more sales driven to make the best use of the brand.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Clydeport to float with Pounds 60m tag -
Employees to sell part of shareholding in placing before end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydeport Holdings, the privatised port operator on the river Clyde, is to
come to the stock exchange via a placing before the end of the year.
The flotation is expected to value the company at between Pounds 50m and
Pounds 60m.
Clydeport was formerly the Clyde Port Authority, operating the ports of
Glasgow, Greenock and Ardrossan.
It was acquired for Pounds 26m by its management and employees - led by Mr
John Mather, now executive chairman - in March 1992 as part of the
government's disposal of trust ports.
Its wish to float then was thwarted by the abrupt drop in traffic caused by
British Steel's closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks at Motherwell.
The company has since been reorganised and invested Pounds 10m - with half
contributed by the European Union - in upgrading facilities.
Last year it purchased the Hunterston bulk terminal from British Steel for
Pounds 4.8m, enabling it to start a large coal shipment business.
Clydeport made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m on sales of Pounds 11.8m in
the year to December 31 1993. This year it expects to make Pounds 4m on
turnover of Pounds 16m.
The company is 67 per cent owned by its management and employees and their
families. Montagu Private Equity holds 28 per cent and 3i 5 per cent.
Management and employees may sell up to a third of their holdings in the
placing.
Montagu Private Equity will retain only 6 per cent after flotation but 3i
intends to retain its entire stake.
The company is assessing institutional demand for its shares.
Clydeport is also to raise Pounds 5m through an issue of new shares to
redeem Pounds 2.5m of preference shares and provide cash.
The company has property holdings, including a site at Yorkhill in Glasgow
which has outline planning consent.
But, Mr Mather stressed, 'ninety per cent of our business is ports'.
The flotation is sponsored by Allied Provincial.
Dr Ian Preston, chief executive of ScottishPower, and Mr James Millar,
former chairman of William Low, are joining the board as non-executive
directors.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Beverley losses deepen to Pounds 1.73m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beverley, the engineering group which has had its shares suspended since
July while it attempts to negotiate a refinancing, announced increased
pre-tax losses for the six months to June 30 up from Pounds 929,000 to
Pounds 1.73m.
Beverley's 1993 accounts were qualified as the auditors were unable to
confirm that the group had sufficient working capital. The unaudited interim
accounts carry a disclaimer stating that the auditors were unable to form an
opinion as to whether the accounts gave a true and fair view.
The pre-tax loss included three exceptionals.
The first was a Pounds 500,000 charge for estimated costs incurred in
connection with the failed acquisition of the Pegasus Boiler Company.
The second exceptional was a loss on the disposal of Beverley Avonside of
Pounds 25,000. This includes a goodwill write-off of Pounds 110,000.
There was also a Pounds 70,000 provision for reorganisation costs.
Turnover was down from Pounds 6.46m to Pounds 2.84m. Continuing operations
contributed Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 4.35m), but the company warned that the
continuing figure included turnover of Pounds 502,000 and Pounds 362,000
attributable to two companies which were disposed of in October, Engineering
Surveys Reproduction and Beverley Management Services.
This will give rise to a loss on disposal of Pounds 687,000, including an
adjustment of Pounds 753,000 for writing off goodwill, for which no
provision has been made at the interim stage.
Mr Colin Robinson, chairman, said the company was currently 'in negotiation
with a number of interested parties' concerning refinancing.
'The future of the group is totally dependent upon the satisfactory outcome
of such negotiations and the suspension of dealings in Beverley's shares
will continue pending the clarification of its financial position.'
Losses per share deepened to 4.96p (2.67p).

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Housing recovery helps Westbury advance 55%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continuing recovery in the new housing market helped Westbury, the
Cheltenham-based building group, lift pre-tax profits 55 per cent in the six
months to August 31.
The advance, from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 5.76m, came on sales up 14 per cent
at Pounds 80m (Pounds 70m).
Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said that the more stable market
conditions were enabling the company to achieve its growth targets. The
average selling price rose from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 63,000 over the
year, although this was mostly due to the group selling larger properties.
'Interest has picked up, but is still limited,' said Mr Fraser. He added
that worries about employment and interest rates were subduing prices.
'There is minimal house price inflation at the moment,' he said.
Cost pressures, which had been prominent at the beginning of the year, had
eased. Mr Fraser estimated that material and labour costs were up by about 5
per cent year-on-year.
Westbury's land bank with planning permission remained stable at 6,400, with
the purchase of more than 1,100 plots at an average price of Pounds 14,200.
Stiff competition in the land market had prevented further replenishment.
However, the strategic land development stock had risen by 800 plots to
5,300 since the year-end.
The interest charge jumped from Pounds 455,000 to Pounds 817,000, while
there was also a Pounds 700,000 leap in the tax charge to Pounds 1.93m.
Earnings per share rose 57 per cent to 5.8p (3.7p).
The interim dividend goes up 0.15p to 1.9p. Mr Fraser said he would be
disappointed if the full-year figure was not increased as well.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Thames Water buoys up sector - Shareholders
can expect generous pay-outs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was always going to be a bumper year for water companies, as they reap
the benefits of cost-cutting and enjoy the final stage of generous price
limits set in 1989.
Yet, as Thames Water opened the sector's interim reporting season yesterday,
it appeared this could be a bumper year for shareholders as well.
Thames Water's greater than expected 11 per cent increase in its interim
dividend, and coyly optimistic views for the full year, have heightened even
the most bullish pay-out expectations for the sector as a whole.
Previously, analysts had been looking for average dividend increases of
about 8 per cent at the half-way stage and earnings growth of about 10 per
cent.
Last night, the market appeared to have adopted Thames Water's argument that
11 per cent earnings growth justified an equivalent increase in the pay-out.
Forecasts for interim dividend growth were revised upwards to about 10 per
cent.
'Thames has acted as a pace setter,' said one analyst. 'Provided there isn't
too much adverse reaction, some companies may feel comfortable raising the
dividend more than they might have envisaged previously.'
The rush to share the expected windfall helped to push up the sector's
shares by about 2 per cent in a falling market. Some companies benefited
significantly more than others from the improved sentiment.
Welsh Water was the clear winner, rising 29p to 667p. This company, which
has the strongest balance sheet and highest dividend cover, is widely
expected to beat the dividend benchmark set by Thames.
Ironically, Thames appeared to have been the loser, only one of two
companies whose shares actually fell on the day. While some of this could
have been due to continuing disappointment on the performance of non-core
businesses, there was also the very clear indication that 1994-95 was
something of an exceptional year.
'There is good reason to be wary of taking this as a sign of things to
come,' said Mr Bill Dale, analyst with SG Warburg, 'with significant
constraints re-emerging from next April' when the new pricing regime takes
effect.
Other aspects of Thames' results are expected to echo through the interim
reporting season, which continues with Anglian next week and ends with
Wessex Water on December 20.
Water companies are expected to emphasise tight control of operating costs
and lower capital expenditure. 'The water sector now has the incentive and
opportunity to outperform the deals set by Ofwat,' said one analyst. 'We
should see the first indications that they will be able to do that.'
The knock-on effect of cutting costs is almost certainly going to mean
further exceptional charges for some companies. Welsh Water has already
indicated charges of some Pounds 17m, with Yorkshire Water also likely to
announce exceptionals.
South West Water, meanwhile, is forecast to provide about Pounds 2m for the
costs of its appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the price
limits set by Ofwat. A further Pounds 2m charge is likely for job losses.
Diversification - or, rather, the failure of water companies to diversify
successfully - will also be an issue. The water companies will be keen to
emphasise the importance and performance of the utilities operations, to
draw attention away from the lack of excitement in non-regulated businesses.
Finally, water companies may well have to address the accounting treatment
of infrastructure renewals in the first set of results after the summer
price review.
Since flotation, the water companies have been building up substantial
provisions in their balance sheets to cover the costs of maintaining the
pipe network. Yet it has become apparent that the initial annual
index-linked charges may have been overly generous.
By calculating lower annual charges, the regulator saw the water companies
could achieve higher profits. 'Now the questions are, what is the right
level of annual charge and how should the cumulative position be treated?'
said Mr Robert-Miller Bakewell, of NatWest Securities.
Given the amount of provisions accumulated by many water companies - such as
the Pounds 139.3m at Yorkshire Water - this is no insignificant issue. Mr
Miller-Bakewell expects companies such as Yorkshire to credit the provision
straight to shareholders' funds.
This brings us back to the view that shareholders are likely to get a good
deal out of this set of results. In the longer term, however, investors
should not ignore issues which are likely to overshadow the sector. Aside
from the political risks presented by a possible change of government, there
is the fundamental question of just how geared the water sector is to
economic growth. 'This sector, more than any other, has no real exposure to
that,' said Mr Dale.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rexmore expands 22% to Pounds 838,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rexmore, the upholstery supplier, reported a 22 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits from Pounds 688,000 to Pounds 838,000.
Turnover, for the period to October 1, was little changed at Pounds 15.3m
compared with Pounds 15.5m.
Operating profits showed a 6 per cent improvement to Pounds 962,000 because
of tight cost management, the directors said, while interest payments were
almost halved, from Pounds 219,000 to Pounds 124,000.
Earnings per share were 4.07p (4.44p) while the interim dividend is 1.3p
(1p).

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: VSEL joins consortium bidding for Devonport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard Gray, Defence Correspondent
VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker being fought over by GEC and BAe, has
joined the DML consortium bidding for Devonport dockyard, which is due to be
privatised next year.
The enlarged consortium's initial bid for Devonport was submitted to the
Ministry of Defence at noon on Monday, just before bidding closed. DML
currently operates Devonport on a management contract.
DML confirmed that VSEL had joined the group. DML has three shareholders -
Weir, the pump-maker; BICC, the cable maker and Brown and Root, the US
engineering company.
It is understood that the four members of the new consortium will each have
a 25 per cent stake in Devonport if the bid is successful. Both GEC and BAe
are thought likely to maintain VSEL's place in the consortium.
The tie-up between Devonport and VSEL comes because Devonport will refit all
the Royal Navy's nuclear submarines from 1997. A full refit involves
replacing most of the internal parts and has much in common with their
initial construction.
A link between the two yards allows them to shift key personnel and
manufacturing between refits and new submarine construction, depending on
the workload.
Devonport has an annual turnover of about Pounds 260m with operating profits
of about Pounds 12m. However, bids for the yard will take into account
environmental liabilities at the site and the potential costs of further
reductions in the workforce.
These liabilities are thought to be larger than the value of the company's
potential earnings. As a result, negotiations will have to continue with the
MoD to determine what liabilities come with the dockyard.
The amount of money raised for the government in the sale is likely to be
very small. The DML bid is thought to be the only firm offer to have been
made. GEC yesterday posted its offer document to VSEL's shareholders,
recommending its Pounds 14 a share cash offer with a loan note alternative.
GEC has also submitted evidence to the Office of Fair Trading arguing that
its bid does not present competition difficulties.
The OFT would normally rule on such a submission within 21 days. If the OFT
clears GEC's bid, City observers think the electronics giant could have
control of VSEL before the end of November.
GEC's document says that the offer is at a 22.8 per cent premium to BAe's
cash offer and a 14.4 per cent premium to its share offer.
VSEL's board has voted to hold an extraordinary meeting to change its
articles of association to allow the GEC bid on the November 24. A similar
meeting to authorise the BAe bid will be held on November 9.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Marks to cut holding in French Connection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stephen Marks, founder and chief executive of French Connection, is
cutting his stake in the fashion company from 75 to 65 per cent.
He is selling 329,000 shares and the company is making a placing to raise
Pounds 4.53m net.
NatWest Wood Mackenzie, the company's broker, is placing 2.02m shares with
institutions at 233p, the same price at which Mr Marks is selling. The
shares rose 1p yesterday to 244p.
Mr Nicholas Mather, finance director, said that for the group to move up
from the USM to the main market - expected within 18 months - 25 per cent of
the shares had to be held outside the company.
There was a need to 'normalise the capital structure and strengthen the
balance sheet', he added. Further, the institutional shareholder base needed
rebuilding.
Mr Mather said that at some point French Connection was going to have to
repay Mr Marks Pounds 3.55m, which he loaned to the company in two tranches.
In 1989 he lent Pounds 1.55m as a condition for the company's bankers
supporting a rescue plan. In 1992 he advanced a further Pounds 2m as part of
new banking facilities.
Now that French Connection had recovered - in the six months to July 31
pre-tax profits rose 53 per cent to Pounds 3.07m on turnover up 14 per cent
at Pounds 34.7m - the board decided it should not delay making the
repayment, especially as interest on the second tranche became payable in
April 1994.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: First Leisure venture with BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First Leisure has formed a joint venture with British Aerospace to run two
marinas. It said the move was the beginning of an expansion of its marina
business.
First Leisure and Arlington, British Aerospace's property subsidiary, will
each have a 50 per cent interest in Associated Marinas. The company will run
the First Leisure marina in Chichester and the British Aerospace marina at
Port Solent, Portsmouth.
First Leisure will receive Pounds 5.9m in cash from Associated Marinas,
which will finance the payment by borrowing. It is understood BAe will
receive what is described as 'only a small amount'.
First Leisure said its discotheques division had had a strong year, with
sales up 12 per cent and spend per head rising 2 per cent.
Resorts enjoyed a 9 per cent sales increase.
Bowling sales in September and October were at the same level as last year
but on a like-for-like basis were down 13 per cent over the year.
New bowling centres and the recently acquired health and fitness centre in
Bracknell, however, helped lift sales in the bowling and health sector by 13
per cent.
Bingo sales rose by 3 per cent, with spend per head rising 6 per cent.
The group said it would revalue a third of its property portfolio each year,
instead of dealing with the entire portfolio once every three years.
Pre-opening expenses will now be depreciated over 12 months from the start
of trading rather than over five years.
This will reduce pre-tax profits for 1992-93 and 1991-92 by about Pounds 1m
in each year. The impact on this year's profits would be smaller, the
company said.
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 36m this year.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Jarvis announces plan to 'restore fortunes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jarvis, the lossmaking building, civil engineering and property group,
yesterday announced a new senior management team, an acquisition, and a
strategic plan which it hopes will help restore its fortunes.
The group has been plagued with problems, especially in the construction
sector, and has reported substantial losses in the past two years.
The results for the six months to June 30, reported yesterday, showed
pre-tax losses increasing from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 2.98m on turnover
Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 35m. Losses per share were 8.2p (2.8p).
Mr Harold Bard, the chairman, said the newly-appointed management team would
shift the group's focus from large road contracts to specialist packages in
the water, sewage and waste sectors, and university and health projects.
The change in management is tied to the acquisition of the outstanding 50.1
per cent of Jarvis Projects, set-up in June as a joint venture between
Jarvis and Mr Paris Moayedi, who will become chief executive of the combined
company.
Alongside this, 2.5m new shares will be bought by the new executives - Mr
David Freeborn, Mr Robert Kendall, Mr Henry Lafferty, Mr Andrew Sutton and
Mr Moayedi - at 10p. Yesterday's closing price was 10 3/4 p, up  3/4 p.
Mr Roger Payton will become non-executive chairman in place of Mr Bard, who
remains an executive director.

FT  02 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BT international venture set for US
telephone growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concert, the Dollars 1bn joint venture between British Telecommunications
and MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier, is set to gain
permission from US regulators to engage in a new form of transatlantic
telecoms competition.
The US Federal Communications Commission approval would allow Concert to
offer multinational customers a leased line telecoms service called
'international simple resale'.
This would open the way for Concert to provide multinational companies with
cut-price transatlantic corporate telephone networks, which is a principal
aim of the joint venture in its bid to develop international telecoms
business for BT and MCI.
Until now the main focus of Concert has been international data services. It
is starting to move into the higher-volume voice telephony market.
Concert is the cornerstone of the Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.35bn) alliance
between BT and MCI forged in mid-1993. It is in strong competition with two
other international alliances - Worldsource, led by AT&amp;T, the largest US
operator and Atlas, a venture between Sprint, the third-largest US
long-distance operator, and the state-owned telecoms companies of France and
Germany.
Concert has gained more than 30 corporate customers for advanced
international services since its launch. Analysts regard the joint venture
as ahead of its rivals in terms of service availability.
AT&amp;T is set to gain a licence in the UK to offer similar services to those
planned by Concert. Its Worldsource partnership includes leading national
carriers in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
The agreements by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to take stakes in
Sprint have yet to secure regulatory approval in the US and EU.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Abbey National buys HMC for Pounds 56.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National, the banking group, has bought Household Mortgage
Corporation, the UK's largest centralised mortgage lender, in an agreed cash
offer of Pounds 56.3m.
The move gives Abbey a new method of distributing mortgages to set alongside
the sales it makes through its branch network, while its credit rating
should give HMC access to funds more cheaply.
HMC has outstanding mortgages of about Pounds 1.6bn, giving it about 0.4 per
cent of the total outstanding UK mortgage market.
Like other centralised lenders, HMC has no branches, and business is passed
to it through independent professional advisers such as lawyers and
accountants. It has 28,000 customers and has developed some complex and
sophisticated home loans.
It will continue to operate in this way as part of the Abbey National group,
and will maintain a separate brand name as an ongoing business.
This makes yesterday's agreement different from other recent deals in which
mainstream mortgage lenders have bought loan books from lenders who entered
the UK housing market in the 1980s and no longer see it as central to their
business. Abbey's purchase in February of the Pounds 900m mortgage book of
the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, is among the most conspicuous
examples of that trend.
Mr Maxwell Packe, HMC managing director, insisted that Abbey's bid was 'the
best offer, taking all factors into account'. All the shareholders had
approved its acceptance, he said.
Mr Packe and a few other senior colleagues will receive bonuses for staying
with the organisation for a few years after the sale.
HMC made profits of Pounds 4m in the four months to July, but like other
centralised lenders has suffered in the UK housing recession. Last year it
reported a profit of just Pounds 700,000.
Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said the margins in this specialised
area of mortgage business were wider than in the very competitive mass
market for home loans. Abbey's strong credit position would also enable it
to generate funds more cheaply and so run the business more profitably, he
said.
Holders of HMC's 3.1m former preference shares will receive 535p in cash for
each share - more than the 398p price for each of the 10.8m ordinary shares,
to reflect the value of preference dividends which were not paid. The deal
should be completed before the end of this month.

Sullen indifference from the stock markets has greeted a largely unpredicted
recovery in the economies of continental Europe this year.
At the beginning of 1994 the German economy, for instance, was widely
expected to grow by less than 1 per cent - by 0.8 per cent, according to the
OECD last December - but recently the main economic institutes have raised
their consensus GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent and the out-turn is likely
to be higher still. But the German stock market has fallen 11 per cent in
1994 so far, dominated by sharply rising bond yields and the fear that
short-term interest rates will bottom out sooner than expected. There are
similar patterns in France, where the index is down 15 per cent, and
election uncertainties still lie ahead.
In the UK, which is perhaps 18 months ahead in the economic cycle, and where
the GDP growth rate has accelerated closer to 4 per cent, the caution in the
equity market has been rather more predictable. Short-term interest rates,
after all, have passed the cyclical trough.
These cyclical influences on European share prices are the subject of an
intriguing analysis by Merrill Lynch's European strategy director Mike
Young. The headline warning is that price-earnings ratios will collapse, to
10 or less. Given that average earnings per share in Germany and France may
well double in 1994 and 1995, taken together, and may not peak until 1998,
this will not be the disaster it might sound like. But it implies a long,
sideways-to-downwards struggle against cyclically adverse pressures.
According to Merrill Lynch, p/e ratios in the main European markets will
fall from a present range of 13 to 28 to a range of 6 to 12. The long trend
towards rising p/es that lasted from about 1980 to 1993 is to be reversed.
But the forecasts focus on the long-term trend and do not, says Mike Young,
looking on the bright side, rule out the possibility that volatility could
send share prices to new highs in passing.
The arguments are set out in terms of the theoretical relationships between
the debt and equity markets. The expected risk-adjusted return on equities
is equal to the expected fixed income return. But heroic judgments must be
made about variables such as the real bond yield and dividend growth and the
question of the equity risk premium.
This study manages to be bearish on all three counts. It cites evidence that
the equity risk premium is sensitive to rising inflation, which is probably
passing through a cyclical trough. Certainly the risk premium has recently
dropped, in historical terms, to an unusually and perhaps unsustainably low
level in European markets; and in the UK in particular it is likely to widen
if pension funds raise their fixed income exposures to match the forthcoming
minimum solvency standard.
Real bond yields have already risen sharply this year, and have certainly
damaged share prices. Increasing demands for capital from developing
countries will help keep real yields high (the figure is now 4.9 per cent in
Germany, for instance) and maybe push them up a further 50 basis points,
says the study. As for dividend growth, it is assumed that as the cycle
matures, expectations here will decline during the next three to four years.
Merrill's analysis fits into a broad global framework: the drift of capital
from sluggish Europe to more dynamic regions, a consequent rise in real
interest rates (especially if European governments continue to borrow
heavily) and a rising equity risk premium as risk capital, in particular, is
drawn away by high returns in emerging economies.
But are the conclusions too gloomy? There are some more positive
possibilities, including the growth of institutions in continental Europe
such as mutual funds and pension funds that might increase the domestic
demand for equities and hold the risk premium down. Moreover, the routine
contrarianism of global investors (buy in a recession, is their rule of
thumb, and sell on a recovery) may leave some mid-cycle opportunities
unexploited.
Economic growth, investors may rediscover, can actually be a good thing,
especially when it is unexpected.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Petroleum demand spurs BP to Pounds 415m: Higher
international sales volumes beats expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday said demand for petroleum products was growing
faster than expected because of economic recoveries in key regions,
including the US, Europe and south-east Asia.
BP executives in London said higher sales volumes were one of the main
factors behind the company's strong third-quarter quarter performance.
Replacement cost profits of Pounds 415m were 23 per cent up on the previous
quarter and the same period last year.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said oil production in the first nine
months of the year was up 4 per cent, while natural gas volumes showed a 20
per cent increase. Chemical volumes were up 10 per cent.
'The growth in volumes was better than predicted,' he said. 'There is a
buoyancy on the demand side that is most encouraging.'
Japan was the only main country where increased demand failed to appear,
according to Mr Simon.
BP predicted that the firmer demand could ' ..support crude oil prices' over
the next few months. Mr Simon warned, however, that rising demand for
petroleum products might not translate into wider margins for BP and other
oil companies.
He said the volatility evident in oil markets this year was likely to
continue.
Price swings of as much as Dollars 3 around a Dollars 17-Dollars 20 range
for the benchmark brent blend could be expected, even in the face of firming
demand.
BP's strategy was to remain cautious. Improved efficiency has recently
allowed it to increase its margin per barrel to around Dollars 4, towards
the top of the industry range, from around Dollars 3.50 a barrel.
Its cost of finding, developing and producing a barrel of oil has also
fallen to Dollars 8-Dollars 9, about Dollars 4-Dollars 5 below its peak
several years ago.
The average third-quarter brent oil price was Dollars 16.62 a barrel, close
to the average price many analysts expect for the year.
But market volatility means that BP will continue to use a benchmark of
Dollars 14 a barrel to test the economics of proposed upstream projects.
Mr Simon said BP was uncertain whether the sharp rise in demand for
chemicals would result in the big margins of previous economic recoveries.
In the first nine months of the year, BP made a replacement cost operating
profit of Pounds 133m on chemicals, compared with a Pounds 53m loss last
year.
Mr Simon said price rises of between 20 per cent to 30 per cent helped to
return BP's chemical divisions to profit.
'The price rises are running at about half the rate of those last time,' he
said. Increased competition was one reason for price moderation.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Water stocks rise on Thames payout: Utility lifts interim
dividend 11% after comparable rise in profits to Pounds 151m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprise increase in the interim payout at Thames Water pushed most stocks
in the sector higher yesterday as the market upgraded dividend expectations.
Thames kicked off the sector's interim season with an 11 per cent increase
in the interim dividend to 8.2p, against expectations of an 8 per cent rise.
Water shares rose 2 per cent in a falling market.
Thames, however closed  1/2 p down at 531 1/2 p.
Analysts said Thames's 'surprisingly generous' action could prompt other
water companies to follow suit, assuming it did not spark an adverse
political reaction. 'We are expecting companies to show earnings improvement
of 10 per cent overall,' said an analyst. 'If the others follow Thames's
line they could deliver 10 per cent dividend growth quite easily.'
However, the water sector's critics lined up to attack the increase. 'It
just confirms customers' views that the original price controls allowed
companies and shareholders to benefit more than consumers,' said the
National Consumer Council.
Thames justified the rise saying it had achieved 11 per cent underlying
earnings growth to 36.8p and enjoyed an exceptionally good first half.
Pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent to Pounds 151m, excluding last year's
Pounds 25m exceptional charge for rationalisation and losses on contracts.
Turnover was 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 572m.
Sir Robert Clarke, chairman, was confident of a good outcome for the rest of
the year, although he would not be drawn on the outlook for the dividend.
He warned investors not to expect such a generous dividend under the new
pricing regime. 'Life is going to be tougher,' he said. 'To expect increases
of 11 per cent would not, perhaps, be sensible.'
Thames's non-core international businesses - which had been responsible for
the unexpected Pounds 25m charge last year, increased losses from Pounds
2.6m to Pounds 6.6m in the first half, excluding last year's charges.
Sir Robert stressed that Thames was taking a long-term view on international
operations. They were expected to be contributing profits of about Pounds
20m by the turn of the century.
The utility business increased profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 176m on
turnover up by 5 per cent to Pounds 455m. Operating costs were held and
capital investment fell from Pounds 173m to Pounds 139m.
Thames also announced the appointment of two new non-executive directors to
the board. They are Mr Roger Carr, chief executive of Williams Holdings and
Mr Tony Hobson, finance director of Legal &amp; General.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Yorkshire Electricity loses deal in Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Electricity yesterday abandoned plans to buy a 17.3 per cent stake
in Stockholm Energi, Sweden's third-largest energy producer, after an
effective veto from the newly-elected Stockholm city council.
The SKr1.8bn (Pounds 154m) deal was central to the diversification plans of
the regional electricity company. It is understood that Yorkshire will
receive around SKr200m in compensation.
Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said: 'We are obviously disappointed
that the new political regime in Stockholm does not wish to go ahead with
the agreement that was made with the former regime.'
The swing to the left in the Stockholm elections reflected a broader
national trend which carried the Social Democrats back to power last
September with a more critical policy on privatisation.
Yorkshire's shares rose 24p to 759p as the City expected Yorkshire to follow
East Midlands Electricity's decision to give Pounds 186m back to its
shareholders in a special dividend payment.
Yorkshire could alternatively buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares after
its closed period ends on December 16.
The Swedish deal appears to have fallen victim to horsetrading on the city
council, which owns Stockholm Energi, following municipal elections. The
elections left the Social Democrats needing support from two parties opposed
to the agreement. When the deal was agreed in June, a centre-right coalition
was in control.
'This is purely a political decision,' said Mr Inge Telander, a spokesman
for Stockholm Energi. He said the group, which produces around 13 terawatt
hours (twh) of electricity a year, had needed a partner to bolster its
balance sheet after its SKr2bn purchase of hydropower generating facilities
in June 1993. A deal with Yorkshire would have strengthened its
equity-to-assets ratio from 11 per cent to more than 25 per cent.
The company was also seeking expertise from Yorkshire ahead of a planned
deregulation of the Swedish electricity market. However, this deregulation
was last week postponed by the new Social Democratic government. A proposal
to list Stockholm Energi has also been abandoned.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Moscow in IMF talks over pegging rouble to the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian rouble could be stabilised early next year if Moscow and the
International Monetary Fund can agree a plan to peg the currency to the
dollar, cut inflation and reform the country's fiscal system.
The plan, being discussed by the fund, would be the boldest step since
Russia's first attempts in 1992 to promote a market economy. However, the
proposals carry the risk of a far more costly currency collapse than
occurred last month, when the rouble fell nearly 25 per cent against the
dollar in one day, and the central bank was forced to pump in foreign
exchange to support it.
Under the plan, Russia would be able to use IMF funds to support the rouble
against speculative movements in the currency markets. Mr Konstantin
Kagalovsky, the retiring Russian executive director of the IMF, said the
plan depended on agreement by the fund to provide between Dollars 14bn and
Dollars 16bn (Pounds 8.5bn and Pounds 9.8bn) to support market reforms in
Russia next year. This would be by far the largest amount paid out to any
country over such a limited period.
The funds would be in the form of a standby loan of Dollars 6bn; an
additional Dollars 2bn tranche of a reconstruction loan (Russia has already
received its limit of Dollars 3bn from the original loan); an issue of
special drawing rights worth about Dollars 2bn; and a stabilisation fund of
Dollars 6bn. Such funds, especially the reconstruction facility and the
SDRs, are controversial and will require delicate negotiation by Mr Michel
Camdessus, the IMF managing director.
His proposal to extend the reconstruction facility and an issue of special
drawing rights to developing countries and economies was rejected at the IMF
Madrid summit last month by a majority of the fund's members.
Mr Kagalovsky added that the stabilisation fund would need to be paid to
Russia to be used, under agreed conditions, as Russia saw fit to support the
rouble once it had been 'pegged' to an exchange rate against the dollar.
This would mark a departure from the IMF's normal approach which is to
promise support for the currency but not to pay it to the country in
question.
Bankers believe the rouble would be pegged at perhaps Rbs3,500-3,700 to the
dollar.

Political and business leaders yesterday took the first steps towards
creating a Middle East economic common market from the Atlantic to the Gulf,
based on the free movement of goods, services and labour.
The three-day Middle East and north Africa economic summit in Casablanca was
itself a sign of the progress made in peace negotiations in the region, and
showed the willingness of past adversaries to discuss business.
A closing declaration pledged governments to 'building the foundations' of
an economic community, establishing a regional tourist board, and studying
the creation of a Middle East development bank.
The 14-point declaration also said governments would encourage the
establishment of a private sector regional chamber of commerce and business
council to facilitate intra-regional trade. It also hopes to develop a
partnership between the public and private sectors and produce further free
market reforms. It looked forward to 'rapid movement' towards a regional
peace which would include Syria and Lebanon, though both countries boycotted
the event.
A follow-up conference is to be held in the Jordanian capital Amman before
June next year. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said the
revolutionary declaration was 'not a piece of paper, but a birth' of a new
Middle East. Mr Klaus Schwab, president of the summit's co-sponsors - the
World Economic Forum - welcomed the talks, and called on participants to
'turn contacts into contracts'.
The event, which brought together 1,200 international businessmen, ended on
a note of conciliation when Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan said yesterday his
country would hand over administration of Islamic sites to Palestinians when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation reach a final settlement on
the status of Jerusalem.
The statement was aimed at defusing tensions between Jordan and the PLO
after Israel recognised the special custodial role of King Hussein of Jordan
over the sites in last month's Israel-Jordan peace treaty.
The declaration sought to calm PLO fears that it was being marginalised at
the summit by urging attention from international aid donors and private
companies towards the plight of Palestinians and by implicitly criticising
Israel for closing the borders with the Palestinian territories two weeks
ago.
Mr Peres, addressing PLO chairman Mr Yassir Arafat, said: 'We consider the
Palestinian people the heart of the problem and we want to solve it together
rightly and justly.'
Mr Arafat said that Palestinians were expecting the dawning of 'a new era
and new region' and said that talks over the future of Jerusalem should mark
a 'new vocabulary of dialogue' among Islam, Christianity and Judaism.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Senators criticise CIA over spy case
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US senators demanded fundamental changes in the culture of the Central
Intelligence Agency yesterday.
They castigated its director for his response to the discovery of a Russian
spy within the agency's counter-intelligence division this year.
The Senate intelligence committee said it found 'a bureaucracy which was
excessively tolerant of serious personal and professional misconduct among
its employees, where security was lax and ineffective'.
The committee also criticised the disciplinary action taken by Mr James
Woolsey, the CIA director, after the unmasking as a spy of Mr Aldrich Ames.
In a detailed report, the committee said 'gross negligence' had allowed Mr
Ames to remain undiscovered for almost nine years. He was arrested in
February and jailed for life after admitting spying for the Soviet Union and
then Russia.
The findings come at a difficult time for the CIA, as the justification for
maintaining a Dollars 27bn annual intelligence budget after the end of the
cold war comes under increasing pressure.
Apart from its handling of the Ames case, the agency has been challenged on
questionable judgments in countries such as Haiti, where it repeatedly
undermined President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and kept supporters of the
military junta on its payroll.
The committee said it had found 'a system and a culture unwilling and unable
 -particularly in the early years of Ames's betrayal - to face, assess and
investigate the catastrophic blow Ames had dealt to the core of its
operations'.
The committee found Mr Woolsey's disciplinary action inadequate. It says he
only issued letters of reprimand to seven retired and four current CIA
employees. None of the employees was fired, demoted, suspended or even
reassigned.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City's immediate response to Thames Water's higher than expected interim
dividend was to mark up the whole sector. This was based on the assumption
that, unless Thames' 11 per cent increase attracted too much political flak,
the rest of the herd would follow its lead. One snag with this argument is
that Thames is partly catching up after last year's unusually low rise to
reflect the poor performance of its non-core businesses. The increase over
two years was only 18 per cent.
More importantly, the Thames increase is entirely backward-looking. The
company stressed that it should be seen in the context of the very
profitable final year of the old regulatory regime and not as a pointer to
prospects in the much tougher five years to come.
The new price caps will mean very modest revenue growth after inflation.
Though Thames can cut operating costs further, a steadily rising tax rate
means it will be hard to raise earnings much faster than inflation.
Significant real dividend increases will therefore have to come from
reducing earnings cover. Thames could increase its pay-out by nearly half
and still cover it twice. But the company is unlikely to go that far. Annual
real growth of 4 per cent over the next five years is about as much as can
be expected. Given the better dividend prospects elsewhere and the political
risks to water companies if Labour wins the next election, a 30 per cent
yield premium to the market is not over-generous.

FT  02 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Hongkong Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 15 per cent growth in Hongkong Telecom's half-year earnings was in line
with expectations. But the figures were a disappointment nonetheless. The
reason was the pedestrian 11 per cent increase in turnover - pedestrian,
that is, for a company valued at a substantial premium to the Hong Kong
market. But for a reduced tax rate and a lower management fee paid to Cable
&amp; Wireless, Hongkong Telecom's parent, earnings growth would have been more
modest.
Worryingly, the main culprit behind the sluggish sales picture was China.
The country generates about a third of the group's international revenues,
and enormous excitement among investors. In the first half, growth in call
traffic with China slowed to 21 per cent compared with the 30 per cent of
recent years. The unexpected slowdown is unlikely to be temporary. It
highlights the risk and volatility associated with China, rather than just
the opportunities. That Chinese growth rates have slipped does not obscure
the enormous potential of the Chinese market, which Hongkong Telecom is well
placed to exploit. But yesterday's figures will rightly serve to puncture
the somewhat unreflecting euphoria which followed last month's announcement
of a planned Dollars 300m direct investment in the country.
Hongkong Telecom is under pressure in other areas of its international
business and will shortly face intensified competition in its domestic
market as well. The company may be well-placed and well-managed but the
shares look expensive.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP's debt mountain, which previously threatened to engulf the group, is
firmly under control. Disposals and strong cash flow have reduced debt by
Dollars 6bn since 1992, helping to cut the interest burden. On the trading
front, the outlook appears promising with profits growth driven by a
recovery in petrochemicals prices and continued cost cutting.
BP is now in the happier position of deciding how much of its cash flow
should be invested and how much distributed to shareholders. After its
previous traumas, the management is right to be cautious. But earnings can
be advanced only so far by reducing costs and there is a danger the group
could miss opportunities through under-investment. With BP's return on
capital at 12 per cent - better than all but a couple of its US rivals - the
company can afford to increase capital spending. But BP's exploration effort
is proving highly productive, so it may not need to invest a great deal more
to increase its global market share.
The stock still has ground to recover after its collapse in 1991 and 1992.
As the group's rehabilitation continues, it should continue to outperform
its oil peers. BP remains at a discount of up to 15 per cent against US
groups on both a cash flow and price earnings basis. True, the yield is
still low. But if the company can deliver on the market's expectations of 20
per cent dividend growth, that will no longer appear so great a drawback.

<TEXT>
UK base rates will rise. Nothing in yesterday's inflation report from the
Bank of England will change that. But the reduction in the Bank's
medium-term inflation forecast to 2.5 per cent means that a rise in rates is
not pressing. Nor may the eventual increase need to be as great as the
markets fear.
The report could still provide Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, with an
excuse to push for an immediate rate increase in his meeting today with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. It plausibly argues that the probability of
overshooting the 2.5 per cent forecast is greater than that of
undershooting. The main risk is that producer price inflation will feed
through to retail prices. Moreover, the Bank clearly feels uncomfortable
with a projection right at the top of its 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent target
range. Even so, the betting must be that Bank will wait for further evidence
before urging action.
Central to the Bank's analysis is the assumption that September's increase
in base rates will cut inflation by nearly half a percentage point. The
reasoning is that consumers are still so heavily weighed down by debt that
interest rate rises will have a bigger effect on demand than in previous
cycles. If the Bank is correct, inflation could fall to the middle of its
target range without any need for base rates at the peak to rise beyond 7
per cent.
All this is encouraging for markets. Though US bonds may continue to be
knocked by fears over US inflation, the better inflation outlook in the UK
should lead to a further narrowing in yield gap between gilts and
Treasuries. Equities would then be carried higher too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So much is said about digital television that the creation of a new channel
is practically warranted just to carry the verbiage. Yet there are reasons
to be sceptical. Politicians have been particularly guilty of talking up the
prospects. But in their desire to predict the future of one of the world's
fastest-changing industries from a single piece of technology, they are
overlooking, not for the first time, that the technology is still in search
of a market.
The debate is heating up because the technology to compress a television
signal digitally has only just begun to work. In increasing greatly the
amount of information which can be delivered, it enables television
operators either to send out 10 times as many channels or to improve the
quality of the picture, through high-definition or wide-screen pictures, for
example.
But there are snags: most importantly, the need for expensive new equipment
at some points along the line between the studio and the viewer's home. Such
additional costs are likely to be highest for digital terrestrial
television, which would need new equipment at almost every stage along that
line: studios, transmitters and, most problematically, further black boxes
on top of viewers' sets. One slice of those costs - the need for new
transmitters - would be removed if the signal were distributed by satellite
direct to viewers' homes. The costs would be lowest if the signal were sent
by satellite to cable television systems for onward distribution: cable
operators would need new reception equipment, but not viewers.
Of those three options, the two which depend on satellite distribution are
worth taking seriously at present. Yesterday Canal Plus, the French pay-TV
channel, said it planned to be the first in Europe to deliver digital
satellite services to homes. It remains to be seen, however, whether demand
for enhanced services will emerge - either for dozens more channels or for
better quality pictures - and how much viewers will be prepared to pay for
them.
The option which is least worth taking seriously is the one the UK
government has most enthusiastically embraced: digital terrestrial
television. This summer, the government said that it would reserve for
future digital services one of the two frequencies it had previously set
aside for a fifth terrestrial television channel. The result is to reduce
the proportion of the country which Channel 5 will cover from about 70 per
cent to just over 52 per cent, although the range may yet be boosted if
other frequencies become available.
Yesterday the Independent Television Commission advertised the Channel 5
licence for a second time, although its coverage and commercial viability
remain uncertain. What is clear, however, is that the full potential of a
new service which could be immediately available to viewers has been
jeopardised for a technology which may remain unwanted.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The Bank's view of prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mr Eddie George pointed out last week, practitioners of monetary policy
have no crystal ball to tell them when to act. What the governor of the Bank
of England has instead is a medium-term target for inflation, a wide range
of economic forecasts, and a judgment on how to reconcile the two.
To gauge by the Bank's latest inflation report, his institution's current
opinion is that September's interest rate rise has reduced the gap between
target and forecast. If interest rates were to remain unchanged, the report
says that the single most likely outcome for inflation in the first half of
1996 is 2 1/2 per cent. This is at the top of the government's 1-2 1/2
target range, and somewhat lower than the 3 per cent forecast in August. But
there is a better than even chance of its being exceeded, at least without
further increases in interest rates.
As the Bank is keen to stress, the scope for error is wide. Its own
forecasting record shows that already. It has been caught out, once again,
by the slow pace of inflation in the three months since its last report.
Instead of rising slightly in the third quarter, as predicted, the
government's target measure fell further in September, to a new low of 2 per
cent.
The Bank lists five risks to the government's target for the end of the
parliament. One, the growth rate of narrow money, has picked up since the
last report. It grew at an annual rate of 7.3 per cent in October, compared
to 6.5 per cent in August, and is still well above its 0-4 per cent
monitoring range. This is cause for concern, but the slow pace of the
broader credit measures presents little evidence for a take-off in consumer
spending.
Of greater interest are the other potential inflation risks cited by the
Bank. As the report rightly notes, rising demand - especially overseas -
appears to be putting upward pressure on producer prices. Thus far, lower
unit labour costs have helped companies absorb much of the increase.
Furthermore, tough competition at the retail level has largely spared
consumers a rise in final prices.
This means that the growth rate in producer prices, which has picked up in
recent months, continues to exceed that of retail prices. But neither of the
factors currently restraining the latter will necessarily last indefinitely.
The same caution applies to the likely course of events in the labour
market, the last - and most important - of the Bank's potential risks for
future inflation.
Underlying nominal wage growth has been moderate and rather stable in the
recovery thus far. As with the increased competition among retailers, this
could represent a positive structural change in the economy. But similar
'miracles' have been declared in the past.
The Chancellor may be convinced that things have changed. But the Bank would
rather not take any chances. There is a danger that it will turn out to be
crying wolf. Given past experience, that must be more sensible than assuming
the wolf is slain.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Arbitrary justice in the City: Recent fraud prosecution
failures have advanced the case for more powers for financial regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it emerged last week that former boxer George Walker had been cleared
of masterminding a Pounds 19m fraud at Brent Walker, the news was greeted by
financial commentators much as cricket correspondents treat another defeat
for England in an off-season. There was a ritual groan to the effect that
the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) had done it again: another failed
prosecution at a cost of millions to the taxpayer.
The response is understandable, whatever the merits of the verdict in the
Brent Walker case, if only because of the cumulative evidence that justice
in white-collar crime trials is so arbitrary.
At one extreme, financial services salesman Roger Levitt inflicted serious
losses on scores of investors, for which he was required to do a mere 180
hours of community service after pleading guilty to fraud in a complex plea
bargain. At the other, Ernest Saunders made plenty of money for investors
and no fortune for himself in the Guinness takeover of Distillers, yet went
to jail.
There is nonetheless a risk that the SFO, for all its blunders, is picking
up an undue proportion of the flak. To judge a prosecuting authority by the
number of people sent down is a crude yardstick. Policemen are not rewarded
on the basis of successful convictions, or the effectiveness of a regiment
judged by the number of people it kills.
Moreover, the high burden of proof required in criminal cases, the
capricious judgments of some juries and the loopy behaviour of certain
judges are features of the criminal justice system as a whole, not of fraud
trials in particular.
The complexity of fraud raises questions about relying on financially
unqualified jurors to reach verdicts. But the frequent failure of juries to
convict in fraud trials might also reflect a lack of consensus about the use
of criminal penalties where there are either no obvious victims, or where
the losses are hard to identify.
There is, in fact, a growing tide of opinion among financial regulators that
the line between criminal and civil penalties has been wrongly drawn; and
that a beefed-up regulatory apparatus, applying a less demanding standard of
proof, could more effectively tackle some of the work now done by the
courts. What criteria should determine the division of labour?
Some financial fraud constitutes obvious robbery. In the Barlow Clowes case,
for example, Mr Peter Clowes took money from investors and used it to
finance personal expenditure, including the purchase of a yacht. He was
rightly convicted. In a country where more than 40 per cent of people found
guilty of thefts of under Pounds 200 go to prison, reducing the sanction in
such cases would be an unacceptable instance of double standards.
In contrast, nobody in the Brent Walker case was accused of having a hand
directly in the till. The nature of the alleged crime was that the company
inflated its profits by incestuously lending money to third parties to
enable them to buy the products of its film division.
Between 1984 and 1987, the manipulation of the figures caused Brent Walker's
shares to rise artificially high. This allowed the company vastly to enlarge
its capital by issuing fresh equity and to make acquisitions on the back of
misleading information. Investors paid too much for the shares, while
bankers were deceived on the creditworthiness of the company and its
director-shareholders.
Yet by the time Brent Walker ran into trouble in 1990, it was a larger, very
different group from what it had been in 1987, the last year misinformation
was propagated. The financial crisis at the company was due less to
falsification of the film division's profits than to excessive borrowing on
subsequent deals.
As a result it is impossible to attribute specific losses to the original
act of falsification. Yet there was substantial damage, in that many
shareholders and creditors would have lost less if the lower level of real
profitability in the mid-1980s had been disclosed. Bankers and investors
would not have advanced money on the same scale; so Brent Walker would have
gone into its financial crisis with a smaller share capital, owing less.
There are a number of misdemeanours here, as so often in fraud trials. Banks
and the investors who stayed in the shares were deceitfully coaxed - in the
jury's view, not by Mr Walker - into a loss-making course of action.
While nobody had a hand in the till, that does not mean that directors
reaped no personal benefit. Directors' pay packages and pensions usually
bear some relation to corporate size. If manipulation facilitates growth by
acquisition, the directors may be substantial financial beneficiaries.
At the same time profits manipulation led to market rigging, an activity
which can damage the City's international reputation and drive business to
other financial centres. Such issues about the integrity of markets might be
thought to be a matter for the regulators rather than the courts. Note,
though, that in the Blue Arrow case, where merchant bankers failed to reveal
a rights issue had flopped, convictions were reached, before being quashed
on appeal.
Finally there is a public policy issue on the economic consequences of
takeover activity, which arose with the Guinness takeover of Distillers as
well as at Brent Walker. If large companies change hands on the basis of
false information, a misallocation of economic resources could result. Most
people would agree that this is anti-social behaviour. They might not all
agree that it merits a jail sentence.
It is tempting to generalise about criteria for criminal as against
regulatory sanctions on the basis of a combination of incurred losses and an
intent to deceive. There was much sympathy with Mr Justice Clark last year,
for example, when he said in an SFO case against two former stockbrokers at
TC Coombs, who were acquitted: 'I cannot help thinking that this sort of
enquiry in a case where there has been no financial loss to any individual
would be far better left to the regulatory jurisdiction of the appropriate
bodies rather than a full-blown criminal trial.'
Yet in practice so many cases of corporate and financial skulduggery involve
grey areas that comprehensive generalisation is impossible.
Hence the merit of a pragmatic approach proposed by the chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB), Mr Andrew Large. Mr Large believes
that in cases with a potentially criminal dimension, regulators and
prosecutors should co-operate at an early stage to establish how the public
interest would be best served. If the high burden of proof required by the
courts is likely result in failure to secure a conviction, then regulatory
sanctions might be appropriate.
One precedent is the US approach on insider dealing. There, it is both a
criminal offence and an administrative offence, for which the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) may secure penalties of three times the profit
made. While the most serious cases are dealt with by criminal prosecutors,
there are many cases where the SEC confiscates the profits and imposes such
financial penalties.
'The knowledge that the criminal route is available is a deterrent,' says Mr
Large of the US approach, 'while the availability of civil settlement
provides a quick - and public - disposal in cases where prosecution is not
essential.'
The SIB has already explored the opportunities for greater co-operation with
the prosecutors. It has reached agreement in principle with the SFO about
the sorts of cases that might be better handled by the civil regulators. But
it lacks powers under the Financial Services Act to investigate insider
dealing and market manipulation. And, like the Stock Exchange, it lacks a
statutory power to fine.
In the light of the SFO's unhappy experience in fraud trials and the
perceived failure to pursue insider dealers, there are clear attractions in
an enlarged role for the regulators. The risk is that financially expert
British watchdogs may not be as tough on financial misdemeanours as those in
the SEC.
The trade-off is between financial expertise and the independence of the
jury. It follows that if the government does decide to tilt the balance in
the system towards regulatory sanctions, a much greater degree of
transparency will be required if public concern about potential coziness
between regulators and their peers is to be avoided.

The chairman of Amstrad is not known for honeyed language. But Alan Sugar's
statement to the stock exchange yesterday, announcing the sacking of Ossie
Ardiles, Tottenham Hotspur's manager - Sugar is also chairman of the
football club - laid it on with a trowel.
The sacking was 'one of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make
in my life', said Sugar. Praising Ardiles rather than burying him, Sugar
added: 'The difficulty has been compounded by the fact that he is such a
delightful person and a good man . . . he will always be loved and welcome
at our club.'
Can we stand this Mr Nice Guy act? Those with memories will recall Sugar's
rather different view of Ardiles last year.
Then the Argentine said that Terry Venables - the former Spurs chief
executive and manager who was contesting an unfair dismissal claim against
Sugar - was welcome at the club. Sugar was a little less effusive: 'Ossie is
in cloud-cuckoo land at the moment. Maybe he is getting carried away with
the results.'
Now he's just getting carted off.

BT chairman Sir Iain Vallance says that the 'unwieldy telephonic dinosaur
that came blinking into the light 10 years ago has evolved into a

'For most people the biggest change is summed up in our prices - in real

It has risen nearly eightfold to Pounds 663,000.

And yet he says he can't remember Direct Line's telephone numbers. Moreover,
at yesterday's launch of Privilege Insurance - a joint venture with the
Royal Bank of Scotland for higher risk motorists - he said he hadn't
'actually thought about' what his salary might be as its non-executive

Forgetfulness is perhaps understandable in his case. After all, as chief

pay bonus scheme that had earned him Pounds 18.2m over the year.

Drugs can slow the rate at which young pigeons lose their feathers during

It must be getting close to an election - president Carlos Menem has started
talking about the Falkland Islands again. If Argentina were to gain
sovereignty from the UK, he might offer cash to any of the 2,100 Falklanders
who didn't want to stay.
'It's one of many issues under consideration . . . don't forget that Alaska
was bought from Russia,' says Menem. It was indeed, in 1867, for Dollars
7.2m. Given there's strong evidence of black gold reserves round the
islands, what price has he in mind?
Meanwhile, his brother Eduardo, president of the Argentine senate, has
popped across to the UK. Today he watches the Duke of Edinburgh unveil a
monument to Argentine general Jose de San Martin, liberator of Argentina,
Chile and Peru from the Spanish yoke, who also lived in London.
Eduardo - the most senior Argentine official to visit the UK since the
resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990 - is also getting lunch from
Douglas Hurd. His schedule includes meetings with other UK government
ministers - those who are left, anyway - but oddly enough, not John Major.
Maybe some deal could be done whereby the islanders are temporarily housed
in the Ritz in Paris, in exchange for which the Menems negotiate a truce
between The Guardian newspaper and the Tories?
After all, Buenos Aires also has its Harrods. . .

FT  02 NOV 94 / For love of labour: Can the debate on minimum labour
standards be moved beyond caricature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaysia is 'a country of cheap and docile labour which has banished free
trade unions', Mr Lane Kirkland, one of the most powerful trade unionists in
the western world, recently told the UK Trades Union Congress.
The views of Mr Kirkland, head of the US union umbrella, the AFL-CIO, are
typical of western union leaders. The reason for such attacks is not hard to
find. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, is one of the most
outspoken critics of the idea of worldwide minimum labour standards.
Supporters of minimum standards - especially among the unions - therefore
assume that Malaysia is teeming with sweat shops and child labour.
There are poor working conditions in some sectors of the Malaysian economy,
particularly among immigrant plantation workers. There are also some
restrictions on trade unions. But in most other respects, Mr Kirkland's
views are being left behind by events, as Malaysia races to catch up with
Asian tigers such as Korea and Taiwan.
'When workers come here for an interview, it is not us interviewing them, it
is them interviewing us about holidays and fringe benefits,' says Mr Neoh
Soon Bin of the Soon Soon flour mill in Penang, north-western Malaysia.
With unemployment running at less than 3 per cent and annual growth in gross
domestic product at more than 8 per cent, workers can afford to be choosy,
even if, in sectors such as electronics, they are not allowed to join
independent unions. The result is that annual labour turnover is soaring -
up to 45 per cent in some areas - and average wages are rising at nearly 7
per cent a year.
According to Mr Thian Hoo Tan, who runs the advanced disc-drive plant of US
electronics company Komag in Penang, his real wage costs are rising at more
than 10 per cent a year and will converge with US wage rates in about 10
years.
These wage increases are not won at the expense of decent employment
standards. Malaysian workers have some job security and the government
regularly encourages employers to adopt high standards of health and safety.
And even trade unionism is 'semi-free', according to Mr G. Rajasekaran,
secretary general of the Malaysian Trades Union Congress. Throughout much of
the manufacturing sector they operate with greater freedom than in most
other countries in the region.
Malasia's high wages are already causing many assembly operations to
relocate to China or Thailand, says Mr Tan. The government wants to emulate
neighbouring Singapore in shifting to high value-added production. With its
GDP per capita nearly USDollars 8,000 (using purchasing power parity), just
above Greece, the poorest European Union country, it can no longer compete
with the new low-wage Asian competition.
Thus, Malaysia is now too advanced to be affected by most of the minimum
labour standards that union leaders such as Mr Kirkland would like to impose
in return for access to western markets.
'Malaysia would scarcely be affected by what is proposed. If the plan really
was for a global minimum wage - as Mahathir claims - we would be the first
to oppose it,' says Mr Abdul Razak Hamid, head of the Malaysian textile
union in Penang.
So why does Dr Mahathir persist in his attacks on the west and on Malaysia's
own trade union leaders?
Accusations of western hypocrisy on labour issues have helped to raise his
standing in the developing world. He is also worried that the west will try
to impose what he believes to be an inappropriate form of trade unionism on
countries such as Malaysia through minimum labour standards.
Yet beneath the rhetoric, some flexibility is apparent. Mr Anthony Yeo, the
senior official at the Ministry of Human Resources who represents Malaysia
at International Labour Organisation meetings, opposes any link between
trade and labour standards. But he adds that the ILO should be given more
authority to stamp out real abuses, such as child and slave labour. He also
says that, while restricted company unions are currently the most
appropriate for the Malaysian electronics sector, 'we might at some future
stage adopt a different approach'.
If Malaysia is to make the transition to a high value-added economy, it will
have to relax the paternalism that pervades the country. Modern production
methods require an educated workforce capable of making independent
decisions.
'That also means trusting citizens to form free trade unions,' says Mr Steve
Pursey of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions based in
Brussels
Mr Pursey - reflecting a more sophisticated trade union view than Mr
Kirkland's - believes that developing countries such as Malaysia, which have
advanced beyond the first stage of industrialisation, have most to gain from
minimum standards legislation. It will protect them, he argues, from being
undercut by the cheapest labour economies before they are ready to switch to
higher value-added production.
From their different perspectives, Mr Pursey and Mr Yeo suggest that the
debate about minimum standards is at last moving beyond the realm of
caricature.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Spy scapegoats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Senate intelligence committee's denunciation yesterday of Mr James
Woolsey, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, was predictable - and,
predictably, a little unfair. He stands accused of insufficient punishment
of those responsible for Aldrich Ames, the Soviet mole, whose eight years'
spying for Moscow wreaked havoc in the CIA's network of foreign agents. The
Ames case did not happen on Mr Woolsey's watch, and it is the sort of
nightmare experience which has visited all intelligence agencies, including
the British, over the years. But these days scapegoats are expected and
demanded.
What the report does correctly highlight is a mindset in the CIA inherited
from the past, which is much less relevant to the post-cold war world. It
also raises reasonable questions about the role of intelligence agencies
these days. A wholesale revolution in attitudes may be asking too much, but
change there must be: in accountability, in methods, in targets, and in
psychology.
Throughout the cold war, western intelligence agencies were focused above
all on the threat from their east bloc rivals, the KGB, and its even more
efficient offspring such as the East German spy network. Spying on each
other was a mutually self-justifying operation which almost certainly led
both sides to exaggerate the threat from the other. The track record of the
CIA and the rest of the western agencies in failing to predict the collapse
of the Soviet Union indicates just how much they suffered from
self-delusion.
It must be said that whereas the failures of the intelligence community are
depressingly obvious - the CIA's track record in Haiti is only the latest
example - its successes can by definition not be trumpeted from the
rooftops. Just to cite one example, the Lancaster House constitutional
conference which brought peace and independence to Zimbabwe would almost
certainly have been much less successful without the efficient eavesdropping
of British spies.
Today's threats are far less predictable than they were in the cosy cold war
years. Proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is perhaps
the greatest single threat; forecasting of highly destabilising border wars
and civil wars is another big task for the intelligence fraternity. The
pursuit of international terrorists and drug traffickers is a role which
could well be shared with more conventional police agencies.
These are all tasks which certainly require a continuing intelligence
capacity. But the relatively dispersed nature of the threats means that
agencies like the CIA can and should become much more accountable in their
work. Much of it is after all based on thorough and intelligent analysis of
available information, not bribing and bugging. And the more such agencies
learn a psychology of openness and accountability, the less opportunity
there will be for the likes of Aldrich Ames to betray them.

FT  02 NOV 94 / We all need to change: Next year's summit in Copenhagen
should define social progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the peo-ple who gave you Rio 92 (the 'Earth Summit'), stand by for
Copenhagen 95: the Social Summit. You remember Rio, I expect. Behind all the
razzmatazz there was a fairly simple north-south dialogue. The north was
alarmed about the fate of the planet, and had noticed that some of the
world's remaining stocks of non-renewable resources, such as rain forest,
were concentrated in the south. The south noticed that, for once, it seemed
to possess something of interest to the north, and sought to turn that to
advantage.
Southern leaders suggested, politely or otherwise according to temperament,
that if the planet were to be saved its resources should also be more
equitably shared. Some also pointed out that the north, by its sheer volume
of consumption and production, was doing far more damage to the global
environment than the south.
It was a frustrating dialogue for both sides. Ecologists and development
economists alike felt that the urgency of their concerns had not really been
recognised. The sums of money pledged seemed pitifully small in relation to
the ambitious targets set, and there was every sign that even those pledges
would not be fulfilled.
The leaders of northern democracies were not ready to ask their electorates
to accept the radical change of life-style that Agenda 21, the action
programme endorsed by the Rio summit, implied. Indeed, the powerful and
comfortable elites of north and south alike were clearly not about to make
such changes in their own life-style.
Yet many believe that on balance the exercise was worthwhile. There is now a
wider recognition in the north that the threat to the global environment
cannot be dealt with unless the conditions of squalor and hopelessness in
which more than a quarter of the globe's inhabitants live, without access to
clean drinking water or sanitation, are also addressed.
There is a corresponding awareness among southern elites that, whoever's
fault it is, their peoples will be the first victims of continuing
environmental degradation. Policy changes so far may be inadequate, but at
least they are mostly in the right direction.
So perhaps the 'world summit for social development', to be held next March,
is the logical next step. This time it is the south which is bringing its
agenda to a northern capital. Interestingly, the moving spirit behind the
Copenhagen summit is the UN representative of a star pupil in the class of
southern governments applying current northern economic orthodoxy:
Ambassador Juan Somavia of Chile.
Even the Chilean government, it seems, has decided that Chicago School
economics are not enough. Chile has put itself at the head of a movement of
southern states seeking to remind the north that the UN was never meant to
be only a world police force. It also aimed, in the words of the preamble to
its charter, 'to promote social progress and better standards of life in
larger freedom', and 'to employ international machinery for the promotion of
the economic and social advancement of all peoples'.
A 'new world order' confined to issues of peacekeeping and peace enforcement
would mean little to the billion-plus people who live in poverty, 'without
jobs, without basic necessities, without hope'*. It would also be
unsustainable in the long run, even if the world's leading military powers
were willing to devote their forces to it, which they are not. A world where
the top 20 per cent of the population receives 83 per cent of the income,
while the bottom 20 gets only 1.5 per cent, and the gap appears to be still
widening, is hardly likely to be a peaceful world.
Yet no one imagines the social summit will be the occasion for a crude
redistribution of global income. No doubt industrialised countries will yet
once more pledge their best efforts to reach the target of spending 0.7 per
cent of gross domestic product on development aid. But no one will believe
them, at a time when even Sweden is slashing its aid budget; and few people
any longer believe that if the target were reached it would make a great
difference to so-called 'developing countries'.
Some of these countries really are developing, which means they are
generating resources and providing opportunities for investment. Many are
not, including at the moment almost all African countries. The degree of
success does not correlate with the amount of concessionary finance a
country receives. If anything, it correlates inversely.
So what will the summit discuss? All the nostra of the age, from debt relief
to labour market flexibility. The latest draft of its declaration contains
no less than 84 'commitments' in eight pages, with no hierarchy of
priorities among them, and therefore zero credibility.
What should it discuss? The issue which Rio opened up, but certainly did not
resolve: what does 'social development' actually mean?
It cannot be equated with economic progress, if that means helping the south
to 'develop' in the way the north has developed. Apart from the fact that
that would destroy many traditional cultures, reducing the richness and
diversity of our species, it would clearly be ecologically unsustainable.
This planet will not support 12bn or even 8bn people living the way we in
the north do now. All of us are going to have to change our way of life, our
aspirations and above all our appetites.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Spark goes out of the world-beaters: Japan's consumer
electronics groups are being forced to adapt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's consumer electronics manufacturers have achieved a position of
enviable dominance in their industry, after two decades of spectacular
growth.
Their ability to continue that growth, however, is now in doubt for the
first time since Japanese TV sets and stereos began finding their way into
homes throughout the world in the 1970s.
Companies such as Matsushita and Sony are finding that manufacturing
electronics equipment is no longer as profitable as it used to be, and are
moving into entertainment and information services, which appear to offer
better prospects. But the Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers have
yet to prove that they can build more profitable businesses in these new
markets.
Japanese manufacturers' profits on consumer electronics have been squeezed
from three directions: sluggish demand, particularly in the home market;
falling prices; and the yen's sharp appreciation.
Nearly every Japanese household now owns a colour TV set, and 73 per cent a
video cassette recorder. Demand is therefore weak for traditional
money-spinners such as these. New products such as wide-screen TV are not
attracting the kind of consumer interest needed to compensate.
'There are many new, exciting products, but they are not contributing to
profits much because the scale of them is so small,' says Mr Nobuyuki Idei,
managing director of Sony.
Japan's consumer electronics market has also suffered from fierce
competition and from the growing availability of cheap products made in
low-cost countries, primarily in south-east Asia. 'Audio products the world
over have become really cheap,' laments Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of
Matsushita.
Price-cutting has become rife as retailers struggle for business, and cheap
TVs and VCRs flood in from Taiwan and Korea. 'It is no longer an industry in
which it is easy to justify high prices,' asserts Mr Koichiro Chiwata,
industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank.
To add to the woes of the Japanese manufacturers, the yen's sharp
appreciation has eaten into their overseas profits. The strength of the yen
reduced Sony's revenues by more than Y500bn (Pounds 3.2bn) last year,
according to the company. The yen's contin-uing appreciation this year will
further depress manu-facturers' revenues. These pressures have had
devastating results on the financial performance of the consumer electronics
makers. Sony's operating profits dwindled to Y99.7bn for the year to March
1994, less than one-third the Y302.2bn it made in 1991. Its operating profit
to sales ratio was 2.7 per cent last year against 10 per cent in 1990.
Matsushita's operating profits shrank to Y173.6bn last year, from Y472.6bn
in 1991. Its operating profits were 2.6 per cent of revenues, down from 7.5
per cent in 1990.
The company expects a 33 per cent rise in ordinary profits for the current
year to Y85bn, helped by rationalisation measures. But the result will still
be less than a third of Matsushita's 1990 profits of Y277bn.
Despite the deterioration in the consumer electronics business environment,
the companies are obliged to continue pumping large sums into research and
development. Both Sony and Matsushita spent about as much on R&amp;D in the last
fiscal year as they did in 1991, when operating profits were between 2 1/2
and three times higher.
R&amp;D costs are likely to rise further. With manufacturing costs that are
among the highest in the world, Japan can no longer rely on
'people-dependent assembly' but must shift to a 'technology- and
knowledge-intensive production system', according to Mr Haruo Tsuji,
president of consumer electronics group Sharp. 'For that, R&amp;D is crucial,'
he says.
Such efforts have given Japanese companies technological superiority in
making parts of the new generation of multimedia electronics equipment,
which will deliver a wide range of entertainment and information services to
business and consumers.
Sharp dominates the market for liquid crystal display panels used in
portable products, such as personal organisers. JVC is a leader in the
digital compression technology that squeezes information - from sound and
data to video - down the telephone line or on to digital discs, such as CDs.
Japanese electronics makers, such as Sony, also dominate the market for
recording media such as CD-Roms, the portable discs that are used to store
computer data, and the drives that run the discs.
But as more and more information becomes available to consumers at home,
equipment such as CD-Roms which receive the information is expected to
become less important - and less profitable - than the services that feed
into it. This can already be seen with products such as personal computers
and cellular telephones, where the most profitable businesses are in
providing the software or telephone networks, rather than making the
hardware.
'It is the owners of the networks who will be the main beneficiaries of the
multimedia age, followed by those who provide the services,' says Sony's Mr
Idei. He believes that the consumer electronics companies will gradually
become such service providers over the next 20 years.
The recognition that providing multimedia services such as video-on-demand
and interactive games offers a more attractive source of profits than making
the hardware has led both Sony and Matsushita to invest recently in cable TV
and satellite broadcasting.
Sony has invested in a Japanese satellite broadcasting company and Y600m in
Tokyo's sixth TV station. It has also taken a 25 per cent stake in a Latin
American cable TV operator. Matsushita has interests in 30 cable TV
companies and has built up a computer data and network service in Japan.
The consumer electronics companies have also been acquiring businesses that
will supply the programmes and entertainment services for these networks.
Control over software, the argument goes, will ensure support for new
hardware systems and the distribution systems.
Sony, for example, says that it would have been hard to sell its new
MiniDisc portable audio products without being able, through its ownership
of CBS records, to ensure that recordings were available to play on them.
It was this view that prompted the larger Japanese electronics companies to
march into Hollywood during the 1980s and acquire famous US film studios and
their valuable stock of films and television programmes. Sony bought
Columbia Pictures as well as CBS Records, while Matsushita bought MCA, the
entertainment group.
The move has yet to pay off: most Japanese investments in Hollywood have
brought more headaches than profits.
Matsushita has recently been publicly embarrassed by de-mands from MCA
executives to cede management control of its entertainment subsidiary, which
it believes is crucial for its future in multimedia.
Sony is believed to have suffered a substantial loss last year from Columbia
Pictures. The studio has remained in the doldrums this year, with few hit
pictures - prompting the departure of its head. And Pioneer has had to make
successive capital injections into Carolco Pictures, its US film subsidiary.
.
For the Japanese equipment makers, steeped in a culture of
consensus-building and long-term decision-making, management of the
spiralling costs, big egos and short-term thinking that characterises
Hollywood studios has proved more difficult than they imagined.
Despite these setbacks, most Japanese consumer electronics companies see
little choice but to hold on to their entertainment assets. 'As software
becomes more important, we cannot remain hardware makers alone,' emphasises
Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita.
The advent of multimedia and the stagnation in traditional manufacturing
activities appear to leave Japan's consumer electronics with little choice
but to move deeper into the unfamiliar world of entertainment media. As they
do so, their best hope will be that the rewards they reap finally live up to
the greater challenges they now face.

Sir, In his review of Romeo et Juliette ('A night off for the intellect',

FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charging for road use is way to
improve quality of urban life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BIRD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution is
clearly one of the most important documents on the subject of the car and
the environment this decade ('UK traffic growth curb urged by commission',
October 27). Surprisingly, it appears to attach very little weight to
charging for road use - the one political step which could have a
significant effect on the quality of urban life.
Additional fuel taxation will not of itself make much impact on traffic
density in the places where pollution problems are most acute - the UK's
towns and cities. It is a blunt instrument which will penalise the rural
driver who has little alternative to the car and will add to national
freight costs.
The commission has dealt fully and forcefully with the costs to the nation
of pollution-related diseases such as asthma and cancer, road-related deaths
and noise. To be added to this burden are the loss of millions of hours of
productive time due to congestion, the inability to plan journeys properly
and the rapid deterioration of public transport systems.
Road pricing is the only way to break the spiral in a free market economy.
It is the only means to force an efficient and responsive economic link
between the supply of and demand for limited road space and release
significant revenue for investment in public transport networks.
While the tolling of motorways by 1998 is already a commitment of this
government, road pricing could start much earlier in the cities, and work
outwards through the road network, eventually forming a unified road use
charging system with the potential to charge for use of all types of road.
The necessary technology exists; it is simple, low cost and easy to install.
There are, though, two important hurdles to overcome - both within the
control of Parliament. The first is the passing of the necessary legislation
to enable local authorities to charge for the use of road space. The second
is the issue of hypothecation; the Treasury must allow the larger part (if
not all) of the revenue derived from road use charging to be directed to
improving all areas of the nation's public transport services and, where
appropriate, for those decisions to be made locally.
The government will not be serving the aims of the commission and the
majority of UK people unless it tackles these issues squarely and swiftly.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not so blameless on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M A BENTLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr R S Parkin (Letters, October 27) is perhaps a touch too quick in
pointing the accusing finger for the personal pensions scandal solely at the
life insurance industry, while placing the occupational pension plans on a
blameless pedestal.
While correct in recalling the predictions made at that time by pension fund
managers and consultants, he should also remember that this same group took
no initiative to provide the customers (the employees) with what they really
wanted. This was a simple, clear, easy to understand 'pension account' - ie,
such as provided by money purchase/defined contribution plans, where what is
paid in by and on behalf of an individual remains identifiable and
quantifiable and is not diverted to supplement early retirement pensions and
executive top-up pensions of other colleagues.
If the occupational pension fraternity had taken steps in the mid-1980s to
accommodate the market demand 'in house' by providing alternative or
supplementary defined contribution plans, most employees would never have
spared a moment to consider personal pension plans.
However, by insisting on a 'one size fits all/father knows best' policy of
final pay plan the experts only hastened the stampede of misinformed but
frustrated individuals who were thus encouraged to taste the forbidden and
therefore exotic fruits of personal pensions.

Sir, Re Matthew Batstone's article, 'Men on the supermarket shelf'
(Management: Marketing and Advertising, October 27), it is not only
marketers and advertising executives who are guilty of 1950s thinking. I
note that Batstone describes an advertisement as 'showing a man cleaning the
kitchen floor for his wife'. Is he not cleaning the floor because it is
dirty? Unless he is a guest in his wife's house, it is presumably, his floor
also, unless she is about to pop over to his kitchen and help out with a few
chores there?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir JEFFERY BOWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir I was delighted to hear reports that Lord Howe is forming a group to
argue the case for Europe ('Howe warns on Tory EU rebels', October 17). I
find nothing more depressing today than the way in which almost all the UK's
difficulties are attributed to Brussels or to Brussels bureaucracy.
To me, the issue is simple. The UK is a small country which is not
particularly well endowed with natural resources. So far as the future is
concerned, we shall not be successful economically or influential
politically unless we play a leading role in a strong Europe.
Similarly, Europe will not be strong unless its members act together and
cede certain of their powers to the Union, something we have already
committed ourselves to do.
Working with our fellow members of the European Union to create a strong and
powerful Europe is clearly not a simple task. To me, however, contrary to
what seems to be the accepted view in this country, it is not only very
important but also a very stimulating, exciting and challenging prospect.
I recognise, of course, that there are many aspects of the European Union
which are unsatisfactory and in substantial need of improvement. It must,
for instance, become much more democratically accountable.
The UK should be striving to make changes as a committed member, not acting
as if it were a country reluctantly involved in a Union of which it would
really prefer not to be part.
The greatest failure of the present government in the UK is, in my view, its
failure to appreciate and to communicate to all of us how important Europe
is. It is not a good excuse to say that public opinion is against Europe at
the moment. The job of political leaders is to shape public opinion,
especially on an issue of such vital importance to our future.

<TEXT>
If you love masterpieces in their original form, you may often feel alarmed
at the way they are adapted, translated or deconstructed. I confess to a
certain alarm at the current Everybody's Shakespeare season at the Barbican.
Sure, it will be interesting to see what Germans, Japanese, Israelis,
Georgians and others are doing with Shakespeare; sure, I wish I could see
all the Shakespeare films. But we can bet that all this Bardomania will
contain a fair share of Bardoclasm. I try to remind myself that I can love
Carmen Jones as well as Carmen. But the fact remains that the prospect of a
Peter Sellars Merchant of Venice makes me nervous.
It is good news, then, that the Royal Shakespeare Company's own contribution
to the season leads us right back to the heart of the Bard  - his language -
in a week-long series of public workshops led by the company's brilliant
veteran director, John Barton. Barton hurls no thunderbolts at us or at his
actors and he reveals no special mysteries. He is the same source of rare
good sense as in his 1984 TV series Playing Shakespeare, and as in many of
his wonderful RSC stagings. He starts from the simplest premise: trust the
text. And he asks the most basic questions: do the actors make the audience
listen? What kind of character would say these words?
Working from these sound beginnings, he helps his actors to reveal marvels.
During the week, he will work with Judi Dench, Peter Hall, Jane Lapotaire,
Fiona Shaw and others. On Monday, he tackled scenes from Henry V with Penny
Downie, Harriet Walter and Tony Church. The latter gave us a hilariously
characterful account of the Archbishop of Canterbury's fustian speech on the
Salic law, but when Barton asked him to point up the speech's many proper
names, we reached another level of meaning at once. And that level was to
become yet more pronounced in later speeches, when we heard names, names,
coming back with deepening nuances. As Church himself remarked, after Walter
had given a vivid account of Henry V's reading the lists of the dead,
Shakespeare personalised the names of the dead more than he had when they
were alive - so heightening the play's considerable pathos.
Barton threw Downie and Walter without any preparation into the delectable
scene when Princess Katherine learns English from her maid, Alyse. Their
account of this was a gem of spontaneity. Which was Barton's point: in
Shakespeare's day, actors would have had no formal direction and little
preparation for each new role. Today, we have to work to regain that natural
entry into Shakespearian speech. But 'you won't bring Shakespeare alive
without that Elizabethan sense of the language.'
The antitheses of the Prologue; the broken sense of discovery in Mistress
Quickly's account of Falstaff's death; the heightened effect of having the
French king pronounce French names a l'anglaise; the drama to be mined from
the Herald Mountjoy's speech if spoken with barbed suavity; the brilliantly
deflationary conclusion given to the play by the Epilogue sonnet . . . all
these emerged with new clarity.
And as the veteran Church kept learning from Barton's points and his
colleagues' performances, I remembered the exciting lesson I once learnt
from seeing Ninette de Valois rehearse Robert Helpmann in a role she had
created for him 41 years before: one is never too old to learn.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: A 'Giselle' of intelligence / Review of Derek Deane's
new production for English National Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A certain amount of fuss has been generated around Derek Deane's new
production of Giselle for English National Ballet. The transfer of the
action to the Austrian Tyrol in the 1920s - shock, horror - has been cited
as a means of making the ballet more interesting for audiences, and a note
in the programme opens with the question: 'How do you make an old ballet
come alive or a new audience?'
The short answer to that is 'By dancing it well'. But fashions being what
they are in opera and classic drama, the idea is common that the old
repertory is made more appetising today by giving it a sharp kick in terms
of historical period or theme. The sadness is that such galvanic activity
usually serves to mask the inability of dancers and companies to discover
the qualities of a work by more reputable means.
Directoral caprice becomes a substitute for technical probity, stylistic
respect, even rational understanding. Hence such fatuities as Mats Eks'
relocating of Giselle in a loony-bin, or the continuing open-season for
Nutcracker abuse, where any foolery is better than attention to score or
choreography.
And so we now have Deane's Giselle, given its first performances at the
Palace Theatre during ENB's current Manchester season. It has to be said
that his innovations are largely cosmetic. This is not a radical re-thinking
of a Romantic masterpiece.
The text is traditional, the staging intelligent in reminding us of the
dramatic tensions in the second act, where the wilis are shown as vengeful
spirits rather than the usual horde of po-faced misses trying to look
meltingly graceful while hopping across the stage in arabesque. Were it not
for the ludicrous outfits of the Courland hunting party, and a few egregious
touches in the first act, this Giselle would be run of the mill, and no less
welcome for that.
Visually, the production is undistinguished. Charles Cusick-Smith provides a
skewed and unlovely front-cloth of a Tyrolean resort, which rises to reveal
a set for White Horse Inn. Giselle inhabits the obligingly identified 'Stag
Lodge' which faces a hostelry where her mama is house-keeper. (Cue bell-boys
and maids for the pas de six). Albrecht arrives in a Rolls-Royce, whose
luggage-boot will serve as hiding place for sword and cloak.
So far, so dubious and, thank heavens, half-hearted. The peasants are
peasants still, in timeless balletic peasant gear (the boys have Bisto-Kid
caps, which are a mistake). There is little shock for the traditionalist
even with the arrival of the Courland hunting party. All Courland hunts look
like refugees from the wonderful world of soft furnishings.
This gaggle are merely more ludicrous than most, in stupefying hats and
maniac suiting (Bathilde wears a frenzy of ocelot and a pair of curtains),
with Charlie Drake as the Emperor Franz Joseph in a guest appearance from
Mayerling. A winning touch are the skis borne by the servants - so usual at
grape-harvest time.
The production is knocked hysterically for six, and on Monday night it took
the sincerity of Agnes Oaks' mad-scene and the intensity of Thomas Edur's
Albecht to remind me that we were watching a tragedy. The second act is,
happily, timeless and true. The setting is of a rocky wilderness - rather
too contrived in its menace - and the action well-staged, well-danced. Agnes
Oaks may not be one of nature's Giselles, and her teak-dyed hair seems an
affront to her blonde beauty, but everything that care and intelligence can
do make the role credible, and her mad-scene is excellently thought-out.
Edur, that aristocrat among danseurs, is a heaven-sent, haunted, elegant
Albrecht, his reading in the great tradition, his dancing of purest
distinction. Susan Jaffe is a fine and menacing Myrtha, and Deane - who has
restored a powerful sense of terror to this act - makes us feel a frisson of
Romantic horror amid the circlings of vampiric, vengeful wilis. (When Fanny
Elssler first danced Giselle in London 150 years ago, the programme note
declared that Albrecht had fallen among 'the wilis' fangs'. Deane admirably
evokes this long-lost ferocity).
ENB's dancers were in excellent shape on Monday night: the peasant dancers
were buoyant; the wilis (Theda Bara to a woman) moved with implacable grace.
Let the company persuade the Courland mob into mufti, and ENB will have a
sound and useful Giselle.
ENB tours Giselle and Swan Lake to Leeds and Liverpool during November.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Hytner's Don Giovanni - Munich Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bavarian State Opera's new production of Don Giovanni is Nicholas
Hytner's latest excursion into opera - an art form he is threatening to give
up in favour of spoken theatre and film. The staging is simple, abstract and
clear, does not overwhelm the music, and gives Peter Jonas his first solid
success as intendant in Munich.
Why, then, does Don Giovanni not come across as powerfully as it should? The
polished singing cannot be blamed, nor can Colin Davis's inspired
conducting. The answer lies in Hytner's own ambivalence. He sees Don
Giovanni not as a morality play, but as an opera which questions social
norms - offering no judgments, providing no solutions. Like Mozart's music,
Hytner refuses to give indicators of good and bad. They co-exist, and we
must draw our own conclusions.
Bob Crowley's decor is painted blood-red from start to finish. Two
featureless portals frame a succession of dropcloths in the intimate scenes,
a curved tunnel in the ensembles - and provide a dramatic showcase for the
arrival of the Stone Guest, accompanied by the Great Reaper astride a real
white stallion.
The all-red setting emphasises some pointed symbols - the hand of the
almighty, the crucifixes of a patriarchal society. It also throws into
relief Hytner's intelligent direction of the principals, dressed in black
18th century costumes. The cast works with concentrated poise - but the
result is curiously bloodless.
One reason may be the shortage of humour. At Monday's opening performance,
the only laughs came when Giovanni tempted Zerlina with visions of bedded
bliss - illustrated by a pop-up neo-classical villa. But the main reason
seems to be that Hytner is too keen on maintaining equilibrium. William
Shimell's Giovanni is neither a seductive anti-hero nor a villainous thug -
he is a charmer who fails to achieve a single conquest, an aristocrat who
indulges in bun-fights with his servant.
Despite a flawless Champagne aria, Shimell is constantly in danger of being
upstaged by Lucio Gallo's Leporello - whose leery grin, crisp bass and
artless diction make him more naturally hot-blooded. Angela-Maria Blasi's
Donna Elvira is no scatterbrain, but an Ann Trulove who loves her Rake. She
is virtually indistinguishable from Sheri Greenawald's Donna Anna. Peter
Seiffert's Ottavio makes do with one aria, but he sings flawlessly.
Most personable of all are Rene Pape and Alison Hagley. Pape's Masetto is no
pushover, and he has a rounded bass which should suit him for the title
role. Hagley's Zerlina is gentle seduction personified: 'Batti, batti' was
outstanding. And so was the conducting. There was more life, humanity and
fear of death in the overture than anything in this summer's Salzburg
production and Sir Colin realises the full symphonic weight of the
penultimate scene.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Arts: Fabricated thoughts - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Garry Bushell, television critic of The Sun, went on Channel 4's
culture series Without Walls to attack the 'middle class culturati' who
dominate television for suppressing the working-class hero Alf Garnett, it
was not Johnny Speight, creator of Till Death Us Do Part and therefore of
Garnett, who was so striking. Nor was it the black TV presenter Darcus Howe,
who bravely and sanely argued for the true freedom of speech which the
Garnett series represented. The most memorable moment came when Bushell
showed us his local Working Men's Club on St George's night with a crowd of
Londoners roaring out 'We are red, We are white, We are English dynamite'.
Why was this such an astounding and unforgettable scene? Because (this was
Bushell's point) while the TV mandarins provide us with countless programmes
about West Indian working-class culture, Scottish working-class culture, and
even Chinese working-class culture, they systematically suppress any
reference to English working-class culture unless it is generations out of
date, very left wing, or very sentimental. Gosh, Vanessa, 'We are red, We
are white, We are English dynamite'? that's fascist isn't it? Oh yah, Emma,
let's show that nice clip of the battle of Cable Street again.
Those who say 'Come on, don't pretend it's Orwellian, it's all perfectly
harmless', might reflect on the fact that, in the most recent screening of
The Dam Busters on television, the name of Guy Gibson's black labrador had
somehow been changed from Nigger to Trigger. Thus do the Thought Police
become a reality. Someone in television is already doing Winston Smith's
job.
The idea of re-making old television dramas which were originally broadcast
live, or recorded and then wiped for reasons of economy, is a good one. But
what possessed BBC2 to choose Dennis Potter's Message For Posterity as the
re-make to open a new series of 'Performance'? After its first production in
1967, my predecessor, TC Worsley, gave a detailed explanation on this page
of why it was an inferior example of Potter's work. After describing the
play, about an old politician having his portrait painted, Worsley wrote 'So
what has it all amounted to? Alas, nothing at all. Every issue has been
burked. A non-confrontation has taken place, and a purely arbitrary
denouement has been tacked on - much too arbitrary, this attack of madness,
to make the flip comment 'We always win in the end' have any resonance. I am
severe towards Mr Potter's work only because I am so sure that his real
gifts will one day flower into something remarkable'. Ten out of ten to
Worsley and 'Must try harder' to the BBC, which magnified the silliness of
choosing a poor apprentice piece by having it directed as ineptly as any
major drama undertaking from them in the last 10 years.
In BBC2's Walking The Wall and Fall Of The Wall we have seen television
doing one of the things it does best: synthesising recent history. The first
programme was concerned with the physical entity of the wall, from the
moment it was built until the moment it was sold off in large and small
pieces, with fake lumps on sale in street markets. The second told the
fascinating story of how the wall, and hence all the contingent dominoes,
fell. By combining newsreel clips with the key protagonists speaking to
camera - from Otto von Habsburg who led the trans-wall picnic, to Hungarian
prime minister Miklos Nemeth who described looking into Gorbachev's eyes at
the Warsaw Pact meeting and knowing he could breach the iron curtain with
equanimity - it provided an engrossing first-hand account of one of the most
heartening key events of the 20th century.
Have you seen the appalling new chat show in which six embittered men sit
around slagging off women? One of them will say 'The only things I need a
woman for are sex and washing my socks', and the rest all agree and try to
say something even more contemptuous about women. Unthinkable on such a
politically correct channel as BBC2? Well yes, of course. The programme,
called The Last Word, actually features six women slagging off men, saying
'All I need a man for is sex and DIY' and so on. Totally different. Germaine
Greer (who else) is in the chair, and the only mystery is what the usually
sensible Ann Leslie is doing among such a cheerless, self-pitying bunch. How
the world has done them down] How men have done them down] How their parents
have done them down] How ghastly it is to have to have children] How
terrible it is not to have children] Incapable or terrified of simple human
affection so long as the opposite sex is involved, they accompany everything
they say with a constant drone of anti-male sentiment, like that awful
background keening you get from a hurdy-gurdy. Saddest 45 minutes of the
week.
The opening episode of Ellen, a newly imported American comedy series on
Channel 4 on Friday, caused considerable laughter in our household. True, it
is yet another programme about a bunch of oddly assorted 30-somethings, but
it has that fast-fire wise-cracking quality which is missing from so much
British comedy. Off for a major 'inter-gender ordeal', Ellen opens her coat
to reveal a little black number and asks 'Okay you guys, does this say
desperate?' The following programme, Paris, a comedy in which Alexei Sayle
plays an artist in 1920s France, has reached its mid point (three out of six
episodes) without raising more than a snigger and a couple of groans on the
old green sofa. Sayle, one of the truly original talents of his generation,
is not suited to this sort of sitcom.
People are always inexplicably keen to parrot myths. On Monday yet another
commentator writing about Drop The Dead Donkey repeated the assertion that
'Topical quips are cut seamlessly into script at the last possible moment
before transmission'. Actually 98 per cent of the comedy in this - still
excellent - series, set in a television newsroom, arises from well
established character traits (Sally's superciliousness, Damien's cowardice).
The few topical quips delivered in vision are so obviously tacked on that
they are scarcely worth the trouble. Most of the topicality is, anyway,
inserted voice-over above the end roller.

In my days as a reporter three favourite rainy-day stories were: Increase In
Dog Attacks On Children, Puma On The Loose, and Dramatic Rise In Rat
Population. All three were guaranteed to cause a stir ..no matter how often
you ran them. BBC1's early evening series Here And Now starts a new batch
with 'Dramatic Rise In Rat Population'. Which of the standard variations
will they go for: 'Now they're immune to all known poisons' or 'This new
strain knows no fear' ? (7.00). C4's current affairs series, Dispatches,
brings out the discrepancies between cost and penalty for running a lorry
legally and running it illegally. Tax and insurance can cost as much as
Pounds 3,000, and proper maintenance much more, yet fines for breaking the
rules can be just a few hundred pounds, even when a fatality results (9.00).
Ludovic Kennedy presents an 80-minute report on Murder In Belgravia - The
Lucan Affair which, remarkably, promises to 'shed new light on the accepted
theory of what happened on that fateful November night'. Hard to imagine
anything new unless you claim that Lucan did not do it (10.20 BBC1).

FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Planting business skills in
Ethiopia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Borena tribe, nomadic pastoralists in southern Ethiopia, measure wealth
by the number of animals they own.
This can pose problems in the harsh environment of the Borena region, just
north of the border with Kenya. Although drought regularly depletes sources
of food and water for cattle, camels and sheep, there is resistance to
sacrificing some animals to improve the others' chances.
Tradition exposes further clashes between economics and environment. The
Borena sell animals when prices are high - but wait to buy grain until they
need it months later. By then they have less cash and grain prices have
risen - often because of drought.
Hence an experiment to bring business skills to the Borena. The community is
learning to run grain co-operatives, to operate credit schemes and to plan
ahead, in a project launched by Care International, the aid agency.
Care's immediate aim is to act before a famine strikes. Grain which might in
a crisis have been donated free is being sold at a below-market price to the
Borena. They can then sell through co-operatives at an agreed profit.
About 300 tonnes of grain have been donated by the World Food Programme for
the project. By selling the grain to the Borena, Care ensures an affordable
local market price for grain, diversifies business skills in the community
and even makes some money after costs. This allow it to fund other local
projects, such as credit schemes for small businesses and teaching the
community to construct sealed storage pits for grain, which allow purchases
when prices are low.
Ethiopia's problems are largely linked to land use and a fast-growing
population. Deforestation for farming, fuel, fencing, tools and housing have
left the land vulnerable to soil erosion and desertification.
Ethiopia seems synonymous with drought. Yet four decades ago about 60 per
cent of the country was forested, compared with less than 3 per cent today.
Intensive subsistence agriculture has so depleted soil that Ethiopia can no
longer feed its 55m people - even when harvests are good. While the weather
is an important determinant of food production, aid and environmental
experts alike believe some answers lie in small-scale, self-help projects:
such as reforestation, agricultural terracing to contain erosion, irrigation
to control flooding and soil and water conservation.
'Famine is not about drought, it is about vulnerability to drought. There is
drought in Europe but no famine,' says Fiona Meehan of Rest, the Relief
Society of Tigre.
Tackling that vulnerability is often an uphill struggle, as evidenced by
various reforestation projects. Farmers are not always committed to their
success because they fear losing reforested land to the government; saplings
are sacrificed for fuel or forage material in times of need; and seedling
losses have also been high, having been badly planted or an inappropriate
species.
The country has 25m goats, whose hides are exported. 'They are worth about
Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.25m) a year for gloves, but they eat all the young
shoots,' says Girma Woldegiorgis, vice-president of LEM Ethiopia, an
environmental group. 'It's not worth it to sacrifice so much for so little.'
Ideals of conservation may seem outlandish in a country where thousands have
died from hunger this year, but economic diversification is important for
the future. The transitional government of Ethiopia - which replaced the
Mengistu regime three years ago - has allocated Dollars 37m this fiscal year
to the preservation and development of natural resources.
It is also considering preservation of 8.5 per cent of the nation's land for
forests, parks and wildlife reserves. Ethiopia has more unique species than
any other African country and earned Dollars 23m last year from its immature
but growing tourism industry.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Insurers in a storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifteen catastrophic hurricanes, floods and storms cost worldwide insurers
more than Dollars 80bn (Pounds 50bn) since a period of weather extremes set
in five years ago, according to an article in the latest World Watch
Institute's journal.
In 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and set a new record for damages at
Dollars 25bn. The Mississippi floods in 1993 cost Dollars 12bn. Europe was
hit by four severe windstorms in 1990 which accumulated damages of Dollars
10bn. Japan was struck in 1991 by Typhoon Mireille with nearly Dollars 5bn
in damages.
As the damages mount, insurers have begun to take seriously the global
warming theory advanced by many scientists. The fear is that the warming,
spurred by 'greenhouse gases', produced by fossil fuels, could seriously
disrupt the world's atmospheric and oceanic systems.
Lack of agreement in the scientific community has made the insurers wary.
But their interest is being applauded by environmentalists who see the
insurers as a potential counterweight to the power of the oil and coal
interests in the global warming debate.
Christopher Flavin, author of the World Watch article, is urging the
insurers to enter the struggle over climate policy. 'Few industries are
capable of doing battle with the likes of the fossil fuel lobby. But the
insurance industry is,' he says. 'On a worldwide basis the two are of
roughly comparable size and potential political clout.'
The insurance industry could, for example, push government to tighten energy
efficiency rules for new buildings. It could actively lobby for a stronger
global climate pact.
It could also use its investment capacity. 'If they (companies) were to dump
some of their stocks in oil and coal companies or actively invest some of
their funds in new, less carbon-intensive energy technologies (forming a
sort of climate venture fund), insurance companies could spur the
development of a less threatening energy system,' says Flavin.
Unless the industry begins to use its clout in the struggle over climate
policy, its future 'is likely to be stormy indeed', said Flavin.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Place for plastics - A
European consortium hopes to overcome the high costs of recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid the mass of pipes and chimneys at British Petroleum's giant refinery at
Grangemouth near Edinburgh, the small assembly of silvery tubes standing by
the roadside looks insignificant. But the 20ft-high mini-plant could have
important repercussions for the petrochemicals industry.
The plant is an experiment by several leading European petrochemical
companies to address one of the most difficult issues facing their business:
plastic recycling.
With public and legal pressure building up to re-use more of the plastic
that seems to go needlessly to waste, the industry is anxious to be seen to
be seeking solutions. But it is not an easy task because, as Michael
Buzzacott, chief executive of BP's polymers and olefins division, says:
'Plastic recycling is fundamentally uneconomic.'
Waste plastic can be used in several ways. It can be burnt as a fuel for
power generation, it can be melted down to make new plastic products (a
process known as mechanical recycling), or it can be taken a stage further
and reduced to petrochemical feedstock - the raw material for
plastic-making. But most of it currently ends up being incinerated or buried
in landfill.
According to APME, the association of European plastics makers, only a
quarter of plastic is recoverable because the rest is too dirty, too small
or, like plastic film, too flimsy to be handled.
Even this figure creates a false impression because two-thirds of recovered
plastics are burnt for power generation - a fate widely considered to be
unacceptable - and only one-third (or 7 per cent of total plastic) is
recycled into new products. In the UK, the figure is even lower: 5 per cent,
according to a new survey by Mintel, the market research organisation.
Part of the problem is technical: mechanical recycling is difficult because
plastics have to be sorted into their different types, and the plastic that
emerges is second rate. The difficulty of collecting, cleaning and sorting
plastics also adds vastly to the costs.
In Germany, where tough packaging laws have pushed the process furthest in
Europe, the cost of recycling plastic is put at DM3,000 (Pounds 1,250) a
tonne, or twice the cost of virgin plastic. 'If we have to pay such a high
fee for plastics, then the competitiveness of this product is in danger,'
says Johannes Brandrup of VKE, the German plastics trade group.
A proposed EU directive would require the industry to recycle 15 per cent of
plastic, or twice the current amount. APME estimates that mechanical
recycling will only be able to contribute half of this, so other means,
notably feedstock recycling, will have to be developed to handle the rest.
The Germans are currently leaders in this technology. Both VEBA and BASF
have substantial plants capable of recycling 55,000 tonnes a year. But
chemical companies in other countries are concerned about German dominance,
and five of them linked up to sponsor the Grangemouth feedstock recycling
experiment in order to promote an alternative. They are BP, DSM of the
Netherlands, Elf Atochem of France, Enichem of Italy and Fina of Belgium.
Their Pounds 4m project was launched last year and is due to bear fruit at
the end of this year with the completion of the 750-tonne a year pilot
project.
The plant accepts mixed plastics ground into pieces a maximum of 2cm across
and passes them over hot sand which converts them into a gas. This is
distilled back into plastic feedstock and comes out in two forms, one
looking like wax and the other like olive oil. This can be fed back into the
petrochemical plant to make fresh plastic.
One difference between the Grangemouth plant and the German process is that
it could be replicated at many small plants rather than a few big ones.
These plants, with capacity of 25,000 tonnes a year, would be located at
chemical works or even beside municipal waste tips, which should reduce the
costs of collection compared with the centralised German system. They would
also manufacture their own energy and be self-sustaining.
But although engineers at Grangemouth are pleased with the technical
performance of their plant, the economics of plastics recycling remain a
formidable obstacle, mainly because of the collection and sorting costs
which account for two-thirds of the total.
According to Christian Troussier, chairman of the consortium, the most
economic way of using waste plastic is to burn it as a fuel, but this is
widely viewed as wasteful. The least economic way is mechanical recycling,
although that tends to be the most popular with the public.
Feedstock recycling, he says, fits somewhere in the middle. It is not as
expensive as mechanical recycling, and it has public acceptability. To make
it work, he believes that up to two-thirds of the cost would have to be
covered by a 'service fee' - in other words people would have to pay to have
their plastic recycled, either voluntarily or through a levy.
Buzzacott says: 'The limit on how far we go will depend on the green
conscience of Europe. But in the end, the consumer or the taxpayer will have
to pay.'
This view is disputed, however, by the environmental lobby which accuses the
plastics industry of deliberately exaggerating the cost of plastic recycling
in order to obstruct regulatory moves. The industry could do much more, it
argues, to reduce collection costs.
Some environmentalists say that manufacturers of plastics containers should
go further and design their products so that they are more readily
re-usable, doing away with recycling altogether.
The plastics industry feels, though, that the debate about recycling ignores
some key aspects. For example, only 4 per cent of crude oil is turned into
plastics. The rest is burnt as fuel. So if people are concerned about
wasting a non-renewable resource, they would do better to curb the use of
petrol.
Moreover, greater use of plastics can itself save energy. Dieter Burkle of
Elf Atochem says that 100kg of plastic can replace 200-300kg of metal in a
car. This weight reduction should save 750 litres of petrol over the
lifetime of the car, which is a significant contribution to conserving
resources.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Recruitment: Honesty is the best business policy -
Encouraging open dialogue is the best way to achieve change in a company's
structure and its underlying culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is honesty becoming a hallmark of business? There were two noticeable
examples at last week's Institute of Personnel and Development conference.
One involved the admission by Paul Preston, president of McDonald's
restaurants in the UK, to something of a marketing gaffe. Without any market
research, the company launched a cheese, salad and pickle sandwich snack,
called a 'McPloughman's'. It never took off.
The other featured a warning by Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds
Bank, that the shake out from restructuring in the UK banking industry would
grow worse before it grew better. Pay expectations would have to be dampened
 -a 1 per cent rise equated to 650 lost jobs at Lloyds, he said.
Sir Brian was laying the message on the line in a way that rarely happened
in the past. He argued that top managers needed to be brutally honest with
staff and involve them in the process of change.
But can managers' accept it when the dialogue is two-way and employees are
encouraged to be honest about them and the company? Preston admitted
McDonald's UK management was surprised when it discovered three years ago
that staff were less than enamoured with McPloughman's. It was equally
surprised when it heard some of the adverse comments from customers.
McDonald's discovery, which was well heeded, could be a lesson in openness
and frank, two-way dialogue for all companies. Jean Boulton, of Hay
Management Consultants, suggests saying the unsayable - what she calls
corporate blaspheming - can be a useful way to tackle change.
Only by confronting the culture of the organisation, she argues, can
anything be done to change it. Boulton believes it is the people working for
organisations that most inhibit change, even after the need for it has been
recognised and processes have been introduced to bring it about.
'Companies spend enormous amounts of time and money restructuring,
re-engineering, decentralising, centralising. But somehow the people of the
organisations slip unscathed through the process, hanging on to the same
attitudes, behaviours and beliefs they always had,' she told delegates at a
recent Hay client issues conference in London.
Very often the only thing that has really changed, observes Boulton, is
language. While people might feel comfortable talking about empowerment and
customer focus, what they actually do changes remarkably little.
The problem for many, she finds, is that as the structure of the
organisation and its ways of working change around them, people feel less
supported and less understood as they find themselves deprived of the
informal methods by which they got their work done.
Their behaviour is embodied in the culture of the organisation, and only
when this is recognised and changed can a real transformation be achieved,
she says.
She breaks down culture into four elements - the unconscious, the conscious,
the espoused and the unspoken.
Unconscious culture, she says, is 'probably the most influential and the
hardest for organisations to recognise and handle'.
The recent departure of Peter Sherlock as chief executive at National
Freight Corporation seems a classic example of unconscious culture at work.
The company recruited someone it thought it needed but whose way of working,
it found afterwards, could not be accommodated by other board members. The
existing culture prevailed and Sherlock departed.
Boulton says the conscious aspects - those values, usually positive, that we
are aware of - must also be acknowledged.
What she calls espoused culture is what an organisation says it is like.
Boulton claims this oftens equates to its ideal rather than what it is
really doing.
Boulton gives some examples of unspoken culture, what she terms the 'dark
mutterings in the corridor', that need to be brought out into the open if
things are to change. These include: 'Everyone knows that the people who get
on around here are the ones who don't put their heads above the parapet.
Look at Martin. He's always the one that tries to challenge the boss, point
out what the problems are, but it doesn't get him anywhere, does it?'
'They say they want us to take risks but every time you disagree with the
boss's pet idea, that's it.'
'We say we want to reward output and productivity and customer service, but
we all know that technical excellence is what really counts in this
engineering culture. Look at our senior managers. They are our most able
engineers but they don't manage anyone. All they're interested in is their
own technical work, but they still get promoted.'
Are any of these familiar? Boulton argues that only if they are be brought
into the open can change be achieved.
Boardrooms are sluggish in responding to demands for changes to the role of
non-executive director. This is suggested by the findings of a survey of
company chairmen of UK-listed companies, conducted by Pro Ned, the
non-executive selection company, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants.
The independent non-executive as a guardian of accounting and remuneration
standards seems to be a rare animal. Of the 585 chairmen surveyed -
representing about a third of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange
 -60 per cent admitted their last non-executive appointment was made through
personal connections without an objective appraisal of the skills required.
Some 41 per cent intended to create more specific arrangements for future
appointments. These included using a more formal specification, involving
more of the board in decision making and appointing a nomination committee.
Most of the chairmen thought fees for non-executives would rise in return
for a greater time commitment. A rise of 10 per cent during the next two
years was envisaged, and two-thirds of the chairmen anticipated upward
pressure because of the increasing responsibilities of the job.
Where is the upward pressure coming from? It suggests the sector is a
seller's market. Should this be the case when annual fees paid to
non-executive directors are at present between Pounds 600 and Pounds 1,200 a
day?
One problem may be that many companies are casting their net for
non-executives far too narrowly. They could broaden their search within the
business arena, or look to areas outside business - the public sector and
the professions. Most of all, they could look more favourably at women.
Surely there is room for broader-based recruitment if the alternative is yet
more boardroom pay increases - large rises for executives are finding few
champions these days.
Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, points
out that the few big pay increases that make the headlines mask the more
modest salaries paid to thousands of other directors.
Nevertheless, he says, directors need to be more open about their pay
awards, and to justify them.
He and the institute are working on guidelines that will in effect call for
greater disclosure of salaries, closer links between rewards and the
long-term financial performance of a company, and greater consideration of
whether any rise reflects that granted to other employees.
'There is nothing wrong in substantial rewards for substantial achievement -
but there should be no rewards for failure,' he says.

Sir Brian (above), chairman of the Port of London Authority, is to be the
next chairman of The Automobile Association, which represents one in three
of all UK motorists and solved 4.5m breakdowns last year.
Sir Brian, 61, will take over as chairman at the end of next year when the
current incumbent, Sir Ralph Carr-Ellison, turns 70. Sir Ralph, a landowner
in the north east who has been chairman since 1986, has presided over a
period of rapid change. The AA's membership has increased from 6m to 8m and
the voluntary organisation has invested heavily in information technology to
handle over 6.5m calls a year from motorists.
Sir Brian, a former chairman of the Furness Withy shipping group, will
inherit a major private business. Last year the AA reported pre-tax profits
of Pounds 39.7m on income of Pounds 576m and net assets of Pounds 178m.
Although half the AA's income still comes from subscriptions, 28 per cent
comes from insurance and financial services and provides the bulk of the
organisation's profits. Other AA ventures include Britain's second biggest
driving school and the introduction of an emergency service for homeowners
(AA Homeline).

FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: A voice for volunteers - A training resource for
large employers that also helps unemployed young people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One passage in last week's 400-page report of the Labour party's Social
Justice Commission was studied with particular care by Elizabeth
Crowther-Hunt.
It described the eye-catching if ambitious proposal for Citizens' Service, a
potentially 'big' political idea for tackling unemployment through the
mobilisation of young people in nationwide community project teams.
Crowther-Hunt's interest stems from the fact that the Prince's Trust
Volunteers, a royal charity backed by 100 large UK employers of which she is
full-time director, already adopts a strikingly similar approach. Indeed,
she and her patron will no doubt have been pleased that in several places
the Commission cites the PTV as a possible model for its own scheme.
Labour's implicit endorsement of PTV - party leader Tony Blair gave
Citizens' Service a warm welcome even though it is not official party policy
 -comes with the Prince's charity poised for a substantial expansion over
the next few years.
Current capacity is likely to be doubled to about 4,000 places per annum by
next March, but prime minister John Major has pledged the government's
support to achieve a target of 25,000 volunteers a year by the end of the
century - 'a figure which would certainly make a difference,' suggests PTV
chairman Mike Woodhouse of Bowater.
Under the Volunteers programme, a mixture of young people in jobs and the
young unemployed join 15-strong teams, which undertake an intensive 60-day
programme (normally full-time, although it can be spread over 6 months). Of
the 60 days, 20 are spent on classic 'team building' activities and 40 on
community projects and placements (for example, working with the old and
disabled, in schools, hospitals or on environmental projects).
Government and royal patronage aside, PTV's growth plans will depend on the
organisation's ability to persuade large employers that the scheme is a
valuable and cost-effective staff training resource, and that they should
therefore release more of their young employees to participate in
programmes.
The magic ingredient, according to enthusiasts, comes from the mix of
employed and jobless. 'Like most companies we are trying to break down
hierarchies and introduce team working,' says Mike Riley, chief executive of
LLanelli Radiators in Wales, part of the Japanese Calsonic Corporation. 'We
find that sending people on PTV programmes offers young graduates or those
who have come to us from less academic backgrounds the chance to work with
others, often under pressure, and to develop their leadership skills. I'm a
big supporter.'
KPMG, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and National Westminster Bank - and
the Benefits Agency, Royal Mail and the Inland Revenue in the public sector
 -are among organisations that support Volunteering. Employers pay Pounds
1,200 per place as well as their secondees' wages; the unemployed continue
to receive social security benefit.
PTV claims that the results since it started in 1990 have been positive for
everyone. It quotes a recent survey in which 70 per cent of employers saw a
significant change in their participants in at least one skill area; 50 per
cent in two or more areas, and almost 30 per cent in three or more areas.
Improvements in team working, communication and problem-solving were also
noted.
Routine surveys of unemployed Volunteers taken three months after programmes
had ended show that 70 per cent have either found a job or are in further
education or training, while around half continue to volunteer in a
significant way after leaving the course.

FT  02 NOV 94 / People: Neil Davidson to make his mark in milk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Davidson, a director of Northern Foods, one of the UK's biggest food
manufacturers, was yesterday elected president of the Dairy Industry
Federation, the new body representing milk processing companies.
His election coincided with the deregulation of the milk market, under which
the statutory Milk Marketing Board was abolished and Milk Marque, a
voluntary farmers' co-operative, launched as its successor.
Davidson, 43, is responsible for all Northern Foods' milk activities,
representing 50 per cent of turnover. He joined the group in 1977 and for
the past two years has been responsible for milk buying.
Under deregulation, the federation, formerly known as the Dairy Trade
Federation, loses its statutory right to negotiate milk prices on behalf of
the dairy trade. As an industry lobby, however, it will now grant automatic
seats on its council to all major dairy companies.
Davidson signalled that he wanted a more constructive relationship with
other parts of the industry following the acrimony that has marked the past
18 months of preparation for deregulation.
'My aim is to lead an organisation which represents the interest of both
large and small buyers of milk, is clearly focused on what it is trying to
achieve, and is positive and constructive in its outlook,' he said.
Under its retiring president, Jim McMichael-Phillips, the federation was
accused by the House of Commons agriculture committee earlier this year of
'intransigence' in its opposition to the new arrangements.
Davidson says he looks forward to a healthy dialogue with William
Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, and farmers' leaders. But he
noticeably did not refer to Milk Marque, with which the dairy trade is
engaged in a fierce row over prices.
He also maintained the dairy trade's assault on the new system, saying it
had 'distorted the market and led to artificial raw milk price increases'.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: Talent defects to the private sector - David
Goodhart continues a series with a look at the task of overseeing a group of
job centres / Public Services Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Margaret Walker runs 12 job centres in south-east London, serving areas with
some of the highest and most intractable unemployment in Britain. As a
district manager for the Employment Service, she is responsible for about
600 job centre staff and an annual budget of Pounds 13.1m, Pounds 9m of
which is spent on manpower. Those 600 are in turn in charge of paying out
benefit to more than 50,000 people, policing the rules which claimants must
abide by, and trying to return them to the labour market as quickly as
possible.
Bustling between her different job centres, Walker, 34, seems the very
picture of the efficient, compassionate, public-sector manager. She has
certainly got results. Her district of the Employment Service (the
government agency which runs the job centres) was last month awarded one of
the government's Chartermark awards for good service.
She has also benefited, winning significant performance bonuses. But such
bonuses have only raised her salary to a little over Pounds 30,000 per year,
not a large amount by private-sector standards for someone with her
responsibilities.
And not enough to keep Walker in the public sector. Later this month she
takes up a post with the recruitment company NB Selection. 'Private-sector
experience will be useful. I envisage returning eventually to the public
sector, perhaps to run a big hospital.'
But Walker clearly feels there is a glass ceiling preventing people like her
rising much further in the civil service. She believes this is more to do
with her personality than her sex.
She certainly displays an un-civil service directness about the frustrations
of the job. 'There are still irritations like the annuality rules on money,
which force you to hand back part of anything you save at the end of a
year,' she says.
Walker also believes promotion opportunities are shrinking as layers of
management are cut out. 'When you have a large number of people who entered
the department in the 1970s, flat management makes it difficult for the
people that came in later,' she adds.
The exit of a promising young manager such as Walker illustrates the problem
faced by organisations - especially in the public sector - moving from a
'promotion culture' to a performance pay culture.
'In theory the point of such a shift is to make it more attractive to people
like Margaret to stay doing something they are good at, such as running job
centres, rather than moving them on to things they may be less good at,'
says Jeremy Cowper, head of corporate development at the Employment Service.
In practice it may be causing promising young managers to flee.
Another problem for the public sector is gaining the right balance between
local managerial discretion and national rules. An organisation which hands
out billions of pounds of public money cannot afford to give local managers
too much discretion, but with no discretion at all it becomes impossible to
attract talent.
Walker has had some freedom - she has, for example, introduced a
non-statutory childcare system for single mothers - but most of her job has
been about applying national rules.
'We are trying to combine humanity with the spirit of the law,' she says.
Walker was recruited from the ranks of the unemployed. After going from a
Midlands grammar school to Oxford she failed her bar finals and found
herself jobless for a year in 1982.
'Having experienced the system with all its petty humiliations I know how
harrowing it can be,' she says. But she insists things have improved since
then. There is better integration of job search and benefit receipt under
one roof, and a new language of clients rather than claimants.
Given a free hand to make one change to the system Walker says she would
introduce a third category between formal employment and claimant status.
'I come across a lot of people who are basically unemployable but who still
have quite a lot to offer, we need some mechanism for allowing them to
receive benefit unconditionally while doing various kinds of unpaid work.'
It is not an idea which will find favour with a government trying to toughen
the conditions for receiving benefit. But the government is about to become
her ex-employer, so Walker does not care.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Management: For aspiring board directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Psst] Fancy a seat on the board of a company chaired by ICI's Sir Denys
Henderson, and where Andrew Teare of English China Clays is chief executive?
Just such an opportunity was made available this week by headhunters Spencer
Stuart, the Wharton Business School of Pennsylvania and the international
accounting and consulting firm KPMG.
Before would-be directors rush to sign up, though, they should bear in mind
that the company in question - MegaMicro - is fictitious, the board posts
are on offer for just the two days of a training programme next March, and
they come with a price tag of Pounds 4,000 plus VAT.
Known as the Director's Institute in the US where it was launched last year
this so-called Directors' Forum has been devised by the three joint venture
partners to fill what they perceive to be a gap in the UK market for
directors' training. The programme - aimed at execs and non-execs alike - is
essentially a board simulation exercise based on the imaginary but
true-to-life MegaMicro during which participants address issues facing the
company in the course of audit and remuneration committee meetings and a
full board meeting.
Strategy, succession, remuneration, product liability, and new financial
instruments are among corporate governance subjects that will be raised.
An important feature is the panel of advisers - an impressive list of the
great and the good who have indicated their willingness to offer advice,
lead the discussion, or even play a role in MegaMicro (hence the close
involvement of Henderson and Teare in the first programme). Panel
participation is one way the Forum hopes to distinguish itself from rival
programmes such as that run by the Institute of Directors.

FT  02 NOV 94 / People: Expanded role for Sach at RBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Derek Sach, 46, who joined The Royal Bank of Scotland two years ago from the
3i Group, has underlined his steady rise up the Scottish bank's management
team by being appointed to the newly created post of director of group risk.
Although not a main board director, Sach takes over many of the
responsibilities of John Barclay, RBS's deputy chief executive who retired
last summer. Sach will be responsible for the co-ordination of the
management and control of risk throughout the Royal Bank Group. He will
report to Bob Spiers, 58, a former finance director of Britoil, who took
over as Royal Bank's finance director in July 1993.
Spiers is expected to retire when he turns 60, which suggests that Sach may
be being groomed to replace him on the Royal Bank board eventually.
Sach, who used to run 3i's UK business, set up the Royal Bank's specialised
lending services. The division, which has a staff of 300 and teams in
Edinburgh, Manchester and London, has pioneered a number of techniques to
rescue and assist customers in difficulty. One indication of the success of
Sach's approach to a problem which dogs every bank is that the number of
receivers appointed by the Royal Bank has fallen from 420 in 1992 to 150
last year and he expects this year's figure to be around 100.
While Sach admits that the decline in the number of receivers is partly to
do with the recovery in the economy, he also believes that it has something
to do with the Royal Bank's 'completely new approach to customers with
problems'. Sach will continue to be responsible for the specialised lending
services division in his new role.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Formal bids take shape for Channel 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin, the airline and leisure group, and a number of other media consortia
are starting to prepare formal bids for the licence to run Channel 5, the
planned commercial television channel.
The Independent Television Commission, the body that regulates commercial
television, yesterday advertised the 10-year licence for Channel 5. It is
scheduled to come on stream by early 1997 and will reach between 52 per cent
and 70 per cent of the UK.
Mr Robert Devereux, chairman of Virgin Communications, confirmed that his
company was likely to mount a bid, although he said it had not yet taken a
final decision.
He said Virgin envisaged launching a 'general entertainment channel' which
would be 'slightly younger and slightly more up-market' than existing
terrestrial television services.
Virgin could face fierce competition from other bidders. Mr Ward Thomas,
chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, confirmed that his company is to
bid.
Mr Thomas said he had already identified a number of prospective investors
interested in forming a consortium, including several US concerns. 'Our
problem isn't attracting enough investment, it's deciding which investors to
choose,' he added.
Channel 5 Broadcasting, a consortium including Time Warner of the US,
Pearson - the media group that owns the Financial Times - and the MAI
services group, is also about to make a final decision as to whether to
proceed with an application.
NBC, the US television network, and CanWest Global Communications of Canada
have similarly expressed interest in the channel.
Some prospective bidders yesterday voiced concern about the uncertainty as
to what proportion of the UK would be covered by Channel 5.
Some of its original frequencies have been reallocated by the government for
digital terrestrial television. The ITC is applying for international
permission for extra frequencies for Channel 5, and is confident that it
will reach 70 per cent of UK homes or close to that figure.
The consensus among prospective bidders is that Channel 5 will be
commercially feasible as long as it reaches more than 60 per cent of the UK.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Weighty tome sends investment banks reeling: Effects of the
EU's capital adequacy directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain has long prided itself on the rigour with which it polices its
securities and banking markets. Its tough stance, regulators argue, has
increased confidence in the London markets to the point where roughly 25 per
cent of the world's equity trades are executed there.
Yet Britain's investment banks are arguing that the tough regulatory stance
threatens to place them at a competitive disadvantage to their European
Union counterparts.
The bone of contention is the EU Capital Adequacy Directive, a lengthy tome
whose goal is to ensure that member states go to equal lengths in policing
the capital requirements of their own investment banks.
The bankers say they fear that French and German regulators will not enforce
the rules, which take effect in 1996, with equal vigour, giving banks based
in those countries a competitive edge.
'We figure that this directive means that for our trading position in UK
equities, we will need two to three times more capital than we now do,' said
the director of operations at one large UK investment bank. 'And banks
allocate capital on the basis of return. If a particular business isn't
earning the same return, we have to ask ourselves whether we should still be
in it.'
Moreover, the bankers say, it will force them to revamp their information
systems to allow them to report to regulators in the manner stipulated by
the directive. 'We are looking at all our businesses around the world to see
where business is booked and how it is booked and to see if we ought to do
things differently,' said a lawyer for one US-based investment bank. When
the study is completed, he said, the bank may well decide to book business
outside of London.
The difficulty, UK investment bankers say, is that the business varies so
widely among EU countries that it is impossible to design a single regime
which would be suitable for all. For one thing, while most of the securities
industry on the Continent is conducted through a division of a universal
bank, in the UK many of the largest players are securities firms with a
banking arm attached.
The directive takes views on this split in the business that UK firms say
will work to their disadvantage in several ways. First, the directive makes
a distinction between the capital needed to back a 'banking book' and that
needed to back a 'trading book'.
When it comes to the trading book, the directive takes a different view from
that of UK securities regulators. First, it says that capital must be held
against both the counterparty risk (the risk of the financial failure of one
party) and the market risk of each security.
In the UK, the Securities and Futures Authority which regulates the industry
has allowed firms to take account of both factors in a single calculation.
Moreover, unlike in the UK, the directive does not take account of hedged
positions - holdings in securities whose risks offset each other - the way
current regulations do.
Complicating matters, the Treasury has proposed interpreting the directive
definition of 'liquid' securities very narrowly so that only holdings of the
largest UK equities will fall into that category. Less liquid stocks require
higher capital backing.
Also, the directive's 'large exposures' rule creates a hard limit on the
value of transactions an investment bank can have with a single
counterparty. In the UK, investment banks may increase their exposure so
long as they also increase the capital they hold against that position.
'The CAD is going to require us to have real-time calculation of our large
exposures,' said a lawyer for one US-based investment bank. 'You will have
to know what your exposure is to a single credit all the time and around the
world.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Heathrow tunnel collapse findings due next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preliminary findings of an inquiry into the collapse of a tunnel under
construction at Heathrow airport are expected to be announced early next
week, the airport operator BAA said yesterday.
The outcome could have significant financial implications for other large
transport projects using the new Austrian tunnelling method involved in the
collapse at one of two underground stations being built at Heathrow.
Work has halted on both stations which will form part of a Pounds 300m rail
link between the airport and Paddington station in central London. The
existing Terminal Four station on the London Underground remained closed
yesterday for safety checks. BAA hopes to reopen it in 10 days.
Construction has also stopped at two other London Underground stations, at
London Bridge and Waterloo in south London, part of the Pounds 1.9bn Jubilee
underground line extension. All four stations were using the new Austrian
tunnelling method.
London Bridge station alone is expected to cost Pounds 76m. This price could
rise sharply if it was decided that a more expensive tunnelling technique
was required.
Waterloo station is part of a Pounds 157m contract which includes
constructing a rail tunnel between Green Park and Waterloo and building a
new station at Westminster. Only Waterloo station is using the new Austrian
method.
This technique allows tunnels to be excavated by conventional diggers,
rather than by expensive tunnel-boring machines. The walls of the tunnel are
then covered with a steel mesh before being sprayed with fast-drying
concrete.
Two inquiries have been launched into the tunnel collapse. The first of
these led by Mr David Williams, BAA technical director, is due to announce
its preliminary finding next week. A second inquiry by the Health and Safety
Executive will also investigate 'the broader implications for the use of the
new Austrian tunnelling method'.
It is expected to examine whether the technique, developed for rocky ground,
is suitable for soft London clay where it is being used for the first time
on a large scale on the Heathrow and Jubilee stations.
Questions were raised previously about the suitability of the new method for
different ground conditions following the collapse of a tunnel in Munich in
September resulting in the death of three people.
Engineers investigating the Heathrow collapse will have to consider whether
ground conditions were at fault or if design flaws or faulty workmanship
caused the failure.
BAA and London Underground stressed yesterday that work had halted on only a
small part of the Heathrow Express and Jubilee Line projects.
More than 3,000 cu m of concrete have been poured into the collapsed tunnel
sections to stabilise the ground.
Still to be determined is the extent of any construction delay and the
effect on the cost of two of Britain's biggest transport projects.

FT  02 NOV 94 / One-day strike at TGWU adds to its worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff of the TGWU general union are holding a one-day strike tomorrow in
pursuit of an 8 per cent pay claim, adding further burdens to an
increasingly divided and anxious leadership.
The union's executive has offered a wage deal worth between 3 per cent and
3.5 per cent. Further disruption with the closure of union offices is
planned unless the union agrees to increase its offer to its 900 employees.
'We regret the fact that for the first time ever the T&amp;G's staff will be
taking strike action,' said Mr Danny Bryan, the staff's negotiator. 'It
reflects the anger among staff that the union has not properly recognised
the contribution made by them during the last few difficult years.'
The union has gone through sweeping rationalisation with the closure of
regional offices, a 15 per cent drop in staff levels, and the introduction
of computerised technology. 'There is a lack of security in the union. Staff
are frustrated and concerned,' added Mr Bryan. 'We recognise the union has
limited resources but it can do better with its offer.'
In reply Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, pointed out yesterday
that the pay offer was not only higher than the inflation rate but better
than the range of recent settlements negotiated by the union for its
members. 'Pay and conditions in the union are comparable and in many cases
better than those found in similar organisations,' he said. There are no
plans for a resumption of pay talks.
The discontent is symptomatic of deeper troubles worrying Mr Morris and his
executive. Potentially the most serious problem stems from allegations of
fraud and corruption being investigated by Mr Albert Blyghton, the union's
legal officer, in the Merseyside divisional office.
Mr Morris has been taking a tough stand on the matter, warning union
officials the TGWU is involved in a 'struggle for democracy and decency'
which is 'as serious as any external challenge' the union has faced over the
past 15 years.
Officials have been dismissed amid allegations that about Pounds 500,000 of
members' money has been diverted for political purposes on Merseyside over
recent years. Some of the disaffected hard left are even suggesting
irregularities took place during Mr Morris's own election as general
secretary two years ago on the left ticket, something Mr Morris denies.
The controversy comes as the union struggles to cope with falling
membership. Since 1979 membership has more than halved, a much greater
decline than in most other big unions.
The TGWU has found it hard to grow through strategic partnerships with other
unions. Negotiations on a possible merger with its main rival, the GMB
general union, have been postponed, while doubts remain over the wisdom of
taking on the burdens of the ailing construction union Ucatt.
The TGWU's finances may be less troubling than in the mid-1980s but its
check-off campaign has brought a loss of income as the union has not been
able to sign up all its members to have their subscriptions paid by their
employer. Next month the union's headquarters are due to move out of
Transport House opposite Conservative Central Office. The prime London site
is to be refurbished while the union business is conducted from offices in
Victoria.
That departure is supposed to be temporary but it could turn out to be a
symbol of the eroding fortunes of the once mighty union.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Yarrow workers vote for action over 2% pay offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Workers at Yarrow Shipbuilders on the Clyde have voted for industrial action
by a substantial majority.
This follows their rejection of a pay offer worth 2 per cent linked to the
introduction of performance-related pay. The yard is part of GEC, the
defence and electronics company.
Officials from all trade unions at the UK's largest warship yard will meet
tomorrow to discuss the next move. It is expected they will recommend the
introduction of an overtime ban, one-day strikes or a work to rule before
any resort to an all-out stoppage.
'The offer is shocking,' said Mr John Dolan, the GMB general union's chief
convener at the yard. 'We are looking for a substantial increase.'
As many as 80 per cent of those voting among the 3,400 workforce have backed
the use of industrial action and an all-out strike if necessary.
The company has proposed the 2 per cent increase would be conditional on
acceptance of sweeping changes in working practices.
These would involve, among other reforms, the introduction of Friday
afternoon working at overtime rates that would increase the basic week from
36 hours to 42 hours as well as the abolition of a 10-minute tea-break.
The most controversial demand by management is for the introduction of
performance-related pay from next July for all manual workers.
The unions believe this would produce inequalities and cause divisions among
workers. They also see it as a threat to the continuation of collective
bargaining in the yard.
At present Yarrow appears to be in a strong commercial position.
It has a full order book at least until 1997 with three frigates to be
constructed for the Royal Navy and two for the Malaysian Navy. The HMS
Grafton, a Type 23 frigate, is to be launched this Saturday.
Union officials are determined to avoid a repetition of last year's strike
by manual workers that lasted a month while the white-collar staff worked
normally. This time the whole workforce is involved.
The officials want to pursue a more careful strategy of escalation, giving
the company time to improve its offer and ensuring workers do not suffer the
consequences of a protracted stoppage.
However, they believe that management will have to provide a much better
offer to avoid serious industrial conflict.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Ford cuts output by 9,500 vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Production at Ford's Escort car and van plant at Halewood on Merseyside is
being halted for 12 days this month, taking more than 9,500 vehicles out of
production.
Halewood's 5,000 shop-floor employees are working neither day nor night
shifts this week and next. There will be no production on the following two
Fridays.
The cuts mean that by the end of this month Ford will have taken 20,000
Escorts out of production since short-time working began last month.
Employees will be paid their basic wage on the 'down days' but will miss out
on bonus and overtime payments.
Ford blames a weaker then expected UK market for the cuts, though none of
its main rivals is taking similar action. Halewood-built Escort cars are
sold only in the UK.
Ford's Dagenham plant in east London, which makes Fiesta cars and vans, will
work normally this month after losing two days' production - representing
2,000 vehicles - in October. Dagenham has not been so badly hit because it
exports about a third of its output to continental Europe, where demand is
rising again after the severe vehicle market recession.
The Escort was the UK's top-selling car in August, followed by the Fiesta.
Ford's UK market share is about 22 per cent.
Stock levels will be reviewed again at the end of this month. It is expected
that at least some further short-term working at Halewood will be extended
into December.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Superstores forced from fresh pastures: Planning consent
will become increasingly hard to come by
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the era of rapid superstore and shopping centre development in the UK was
already drawing to a close, yesterday's report from the environment select
committee may hasten its end.
Should the committee's proposals be implemented - and environment secretary
Mr John Gummer said he would consider them 'carefully and positively' - they
would make it significantly harder to get planning permission for retail
developments outside towns.
Signs of a policy change emerged last year, with publication of a new
planning policy guidance note, called PPG6, which emphasised the need to
protect the 'vitality and viability' of town centres. Its main effect was
thought likely to be to prevent planning consent being given for new large
out-of-town shopping centres, such as Merry Hill in the West Midlands, or
the MetroCentre in Tyne and Wear.
In fact PPG6 has already been used by local and central government to clamp
down on both shopping centre and superstore developments - especially since
Mr Gummer has involved himself personally in the planning process.
A report last week by Mr Paul Smiddy, food retailing analyst at the Japanese
investment bank Nomura, found the percentage of successful planning appeals
had fallen from 60 per cent before PPG6 to about 30 per cent in the past
three months.
Of 15 planning appeals considered by Department of the Environment
inspectors this year, eight were allowed, but of 18 which went to Mr Gummer,
only one was approved.
This has forced supermarket groups such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll,
owner of Safeway, which have built several hundred out-of-town superstores
over the past decade, to cut their expansion plans. Tesco and Sainsbury have
launched revamped town-centre formats, called Metro and Central
respectively.
Sainsbury now expects to add 25 per cent less floorspace in 1995-96 and
beyond than it was forecasting a year ago.
The three groups yesterday defended the need for large, out-of-town sites.
Safeway said the report 'failed to recognise what weekly bulk-food shoppers
require'.
It added: 'Supermarket customers will not return to daily high-street
shopping, even with fully integrated planning and transport policies.'
Tesco said superstores provided 'essential' facilities for shoppers with
young children, and for the disabled. It said families typically bought
80lbs of shopping in one trip.
Some groups warned that banning out-of-town developments would not in itself
revitalise town centres, unless they provided better facilities - including
sufficient car parking - for shoppers. The British Property Federation
warned that retail development 'responds to social change, it does not
create it'.
'Restrictions on certain kinds of retail development will not necessarily
secure the vitality of existing town centres,' the federation added.
Mr Richard Wright, vice-president of the British Council of Shopping
Centres, said that while it was correct to support town centres, each had
different problems. He added: 'It might be appropriate in a historic town to
consider edge-of-town developments to relieve congestion and protect a
unique environment.'
The Consumers' Association warned that the report risked condemning
customers to a future of high prices - to pay for town centre redevelop-ment
 -and of limited choice.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said planning policies
needed to be revised 'to stop sprawl and help breathe new life into our town
centres and high streets'.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Pollution cost plea to industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's pollution inspectorate has asked for volunteers from industry to
try to prove that tighter environmental controls are not as expensive as
critics think.
Dr David Slater, director and chief inspector of the Inspectorate of
Pollution, last night called for 'a handful' of companies to come forward
and co-operate.
The companies and the inspectorate would look at the effect of controls on
chemical emissions and efficiency, and the economics of integrated pollution
control (IPC) - the regime the regulators have been enforcing for the past
three years under the Environmental Protection Act.
Dr Slater was giving the annual lecture of the north-west region of the
Chemical Industries Association at the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology.
He said the inspectorate believed in IPC, but not blindly. It needed to see
what the policy was actually doing by collaborating with companies affected
by it. 'I am sure we would find that IPC is not, overall, as expensive as
some might have us believe.'
On keeping costs reasonable, Dr Slater welcomed the appointment by the
government of an independent advisory committee to provide the inspectorate
with expert external opinion. But he stressed that companies still had to
spend money to monitor what they were doing to the environment.
He said: 'We recognise that monitoring can be almost a bottomless pit as far
as money is concerned.' But he added: 'If you can't measure it, then you
can't manage it.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Backlash grows against out-of-town retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The backlash against out-of-town retailing developments gained momentum
yesterday with the publication of a report by the Commons environment
committee calling for stricter controls on new shopping centres and
superstores.
The report, Shopping Centres And Their Future, said previous development
policies had allowed too many superstores and large retail centres to be
built on sites that were 'inappropriate on environmental, heritage and
social grounds'. The fabric of many town centres had suffered.
Mr Barry Field, Tory MP for Isle of Wight and the committee's chairman,
said: 'We believe that it is now time to reverse this trend, and to require
developers to demonstrate that their proposals for new stores will not harm
the vitality and viability of town centres.'
The report is the latest challenge to the retail trade, much of whose growth
in the past decade has been outside town centres.
It is also a vindication for Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, who has
made stemming the flow of retailing away from town centres and towards
out-of-town areas one of his main objectives.
The Department of the Environment has published two guidance notes for local
authorities in the past 18 months calling for town-centre development to be
favoured. Last week the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution proposed
doubling petrol tax and halving spending on new roads.
Yesterday's report suggested the government's planning guidance should be
strengthened to include 'a presumption that superstores are best located in
or on the edge of town centres unless there are very strong indications to
the contrary'.
The report also said that a proper study should be made of the effects of
out-of-town developments on town centres, and that no applications for
superstores or large developments around market towns should be considered
unless they included a full study of their possible effects on existing
retailing in the town.
The environment committee echoed the royal commission in calling for
increased investment in public transport, and said local authorities, the
department and retailers should work together to revitalise town centres.
Mr Gummer gave the report an enthusiastic welcome and promised to 'respond
in detail' in the new year. 'When I first proposed that we had to ensure
town centres remained the focus of town life, particularly shopping, the
pundits proclaimed that the public were not with us,' he said.
'Now we have widespread support from parliament and the public.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Irish power utilities look to renew links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Officials from Northern Ireland Electricity, the privatised power utility,
are this week walking the line in what was once the bandit country of South
Armagh to assess what needs to be done to restore the power link with the
Irish Republic.
The interconnector, blown up on several occasions by the IRA in the 1970s
cutting the province from the Irish grid, has become a symbol of the drive
at cross-border co-operation on the back of the peace process.
Following the IRA ceasefire on August 31, NIE has been in 'active
discussions' with Ireland's Electricity Supply Board to agree the technical
and commercial terms for supplying the south with power. Both companies say
it will be relatively easy.
All-island co-operation in areas such as energy, telecommunications and
tourism are likely to increase in the wake of any durable political
settlement for the province, as companies - public and private - look for
cost savings.
Just in the last week, the NIE and ESB have commissioned two cross-border
emergency connections in the north-west of the province, an 'energy-poor'
area.
The project attracted support from a European Commission scheme. The
north-south interconnector is also likely to win support from the European
Union.
Northern Ireland is due to launch a public inquiry on January 10 into the
planned undersea link with Scottish Power. The NIE has a 15-year supply
agreement with Scottish Power. Northern Ireland has allocated Ecu177m
(Pounds 140m) of EU funds towards the scheme.
NIE, Northern Ireland's largest company, said yesterday that the
interconnector with the republic could be working again within five months.
Agreement will also have to be sought on pricing, and other trading issues,
once a study of demand is complete. 'It is not a massive project, but it has
come to be seen as a political issue. We want to look at it as a simple
commercial question,' NIE said.
The company has four power stations, with total capacity of 2,300MW, which
is 40 per cent higher than peak needs. A link with the south would enable it
to meet ESB's projected increased energy demand. In addition, as a result of
the one- hour difference in peak load times, a link would help lower
consumer costs in the province by improving capacity efficiency.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Postal sell-off hinges on appeasement: The Tory rebels'
objections to the privatisation of the Royal Mail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative backbench rebels were last night studying complex fresh
proposals by Mr Michael Heseltine for a partial privatisation of the Post
Office.
But with little more than a week before the cabinet finalises legislation
for the next session of parliament, it was still unclear whether the trade
and industry secretary had appeased enough Tory MPs to allow a part sell-off
in 1995.
The proposals, which involve a 40 per cent sell-off of the Royal Mail and
the transfer of another 20 per cent of the shares to a new independent
trust, will appeal to those MPs opposed to the private sector holding a
majority stake.
But the plans will do little to change the mind of those who are opposed to
privatising the Royal Mail on principle. Even before he met Mr Heseltine to
discuss the proposals, Mr Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield,
signalled that he would oppose any flotation.
'If Michael Heseltine goes for a 40 per cent private stake in the Post
Office that would net the Treasury Pounds 450m,' he said. 'But in the next
financial year, the Post Office would net Pounds 280m in its current state.
Is it all really worth it?'
Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East and one of the most prominent rebels, also
made clear yesterday that he would not be prepared to see anything more than
a small sale of shares, mainly directed at employees.
Such implacability underlines how difficult it has been for Mr Heseltine to
win over Tory MPs with deep fears about the privatisation.
With the government's majority in the Commons down to 14, he has made
numerous concessions. Earlier this year, he gave assurances that the cost of
sending mail would be kept within limits and that there would be a common
charge throughout the UK. He has also insisted that the Post Office Counters
section would remain in the public sector, assuring the continuation of
village post offices. And he has guaranteed that the quality of service
would be maintained.
But the MPs with whom Mr Heseltine is negotiating have deep-seated
reservations that will be hard to allay.
One group is made up of Conservative MPs in the West Country who fear that
privatisation would be deeply unpopular with their constituents.
These MPs - who include Mr Robert Hicks, MP for Cornwall South East, and Mr
David Nicholson, MP for Taunton - argue that the privatisation of water and
electricity in the region proved unpopular and that a further sell-off would
be unacceptable.
Mr Hicks said: 'Privatisation of any utility in my area is not flavour of
the month.'
A second group - which includes Mr Dykes and Sir Peter Emery, the MP for
Honiton - are on the centre-left of the party and are opposed to Post Office
privatisation on principle. Sir Peter said yesterday: 'I do not see why
greater commercialism should not be given without privatising the whole
thing.'
The third group, and the most difficult to appease, includes those who have
opposed contentious legislation before and have little to lose by voting
against the government again. Among these rebels are Mr Winterton and Mr
Patrick Cormack, the MP for Staffordshire South.
This group is opposed to commercialisation of any sort. But Tory whips
privately admitted that the best chance of getting legislation through would
be to reduce the size of the sell-off and change the Treasury's borrowing
rules.
It looked last night as though that could work. Mr Hicks said: 'As long as
the Post Office remains in the public sector and you lift the Treasury
constraints to achieve commercial freedom, I would not find an injection of
private-sector capital a problem. But the important thing is that it remains
in the public sector for the time being.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Reform of expert evidence urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, criticised the government last night
for failure to implement recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal
Justice for reform of the use of expert evidence in trials.
Speaking in London, Lord Taylor said the use of expert witnesses in both
civil and criminal trials 'needs a drastic re-evaluation'.
The commission, which reported in July last year, made 40 recommendations
for changes in the use of experts. Lord Taylor said a handful had been dealt
with quickly but in February 'three-quarters of the package was still 'under
consideration'. We are now in November and the silence is becoming
deafening,' he said.
He stressed that important issues of public confidence were involved since
most notorious miscarriages of justice had turned on the accuracy and
reliability of expert evidence in the hands of the prosecution and on
whether it had been properly disclosed to the defence.
Lord Taylor said that the establishment of a Forensic Science Advisory
Council, as recommended by the commission, was overdue.
He said he supported Lord Woolf, the law lord appointed by Lord Mackay, the
Lord Chancellor, to carry out a fundamental review of civil justice, in
calling for 'a radically different model of conducting civil justice'. He
urged in particular the appointment of a single, independent expert in most
cases.
He said that in civil trials the use of experts increased costs and caused
delays. A system whereby one independent expert was appointed by the court
to resolve technical issues at an early stage could save litigants money,
reduce delay and reduce the stress of going to law.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Delays likely on building society law changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministerial decisions about changing the rules governing the way building
societies operate are set to be delayed beyond the original deadline for the
far-reaching government review - which could mean the changes would not
become law before the next general election in 1996 or 1997.
The two-stage review of societies' powers and duties of accountability to
the millions of customers who own them was launched in January. At that
time, the Treasury said it intended to complete the work by the end of this
year. This summer Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister, insisted that
this timetable would be met.
But some of the largest societies have already told the Treasury that they
will be unable to meet next Wednesday's deadline for comments on the second
stage of the review.
There is thus little time for ministers to take advice and reach decisions
before they are taken up with the work surrounding the Budget and the annual
public spending statement at the end of this month.
The Treasury said yesterday that it was still aiming to complete the review
by the end of the year.
Timing of the review has already suffered one setback: announcement of the
first-stage results, which had been planned for May, did not take place
until July.
One element in the delay was the extensive interest in the plans, which aim
to give societies greater freedom to raise funds, lend to small businesses
and own general insurance subsidiaries, from elsewhere in Whitehall
including Downing Street, the Department of the Environment and the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The consultation paper for the second stage of the review, published in
September, raises even broader issues about the structure of regulation for
societies and how far new measures might make them more accountable to their
members.
If, as could well be the case, the conclusions of the government's review
are not intensely party political, then legislation to bring them about
could be included in the last pre-election legislative session - probably
the one that starts in November next year. But the chances of a bill could
be lessened unless the policy can be agreed in plenty of time.
Even if the results of the government review are delayed into early next
year, they may still not fit in with the timing of the inquiry into
financial regulation by the Commons Treasury committee. The committee is to
begin hearing evidence on building societies later this month.

The government should bow to the inevitability of a single European

'I believe it will come anyway as trade develops and producers and consumers
increasingly see the nonsense of dealing in 12 or more different currencies

Sir Nicholas said a much greater sense of commitment to the EU was needed.
'Parliament should not be frightened of delegating decisions upwards or

FT  02 NOV 94 / Pension surpluses face probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pensions ombudsman said yesterday that he would be willing to
investigate complaints from members of occupational schemes about the way
surpluses are used - one of the thorniest issues for pension schemes.
Among the cases already brought before Dr Julian Farrand, the new ombudsman,
is the return of a Pounds 200m surplus from the pension schemes of the
former nationalised bus companies to the Department of Transport. Dr
Farrand, who took up his post on September 1, said a group of six former
scheme members had filed a complaint about the surplus.
The previous pensions ombudsman, Mr Michael Platt, had excluded from
consideration all complaints regarding the exercise of trustees' discretion,
including the disposition of surpluses. He had felt he could not investigate
complaints of this nature because the law was too unclear about who owned a
surplus.
Trust law, which governs occupational pension schemes, gives broad powers to
trustees to decide benefits, and in most instances scheme members have
little legal right of challenge. While several court cases  - and the
operators of most occupational schemes - have suggested that surpluses
belong to the employer, case law is limited and ambiguous.
Dr Farrand said he would no longer refuse to consider complaints about
transfer values for people who leave schemes, and other disputed actuarial
calculations which are also left to trustees' discretion.
The government's advisory panel on pension law reform, the Goode committee,
noted that few employers took the value of discretionary benefits - those
not contained in the trust deed but accorded to members as a matter of
practice - into account when calculating transfer values. This has the
effect of significantly reducing transfer values and deprives departing
members of implicitly promised benefits, and the Goode committee had urged
that the practice be changed.
Dr Farrand said: 'It is often overlooked that trustees and employers have a
fiduciary duty to scheme members. This may be controversial but the fact
that it is controversial is no reason not to review it.'
Scheme members or sponsors who are unhappy with his decision on the
disposition of a surplus could appeal to the higher courts, thus
establishing some UK case law on the question of ownership.

FT  02 NOV 94 / IoD warns of fall in confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Directors said yesterday it saw no evidence of overheating
in the economy to justify a further increase in interest rates.
In its bi-monthly business opinion survey of company directors, the IoD
found that confidence in the economy and bullishness about future prospects
had fallen in October compared with August.
Directors also expressed concern about lack of demand and were worried about
meeting customer demands and cashflow.
The survey of 300 of the institute's 33,000 members revealed that in spite
of a dampened feel-good factor, 78 per cent said their company was
performing very well or fairly well overall, slightly up from the 76 per
cent who expressed that opinion in August.
Company performance remained healthy as orders and volumes were buoyant in
October. Those reporting an increase in business volume over the last six
months steadied at 63 per cent and reports of increased orders rose from 49
per cent in August to 53 per cent in October.
However, those reporting an increased profits trend slipped from 54 per cent
in August to 51 per cent last month. Investment and employment prospects
were still strong, if slightly down from the previous survey.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Iod director general, said: 'We are still enjoying
steady, positive growth but there is now evidence that the rate of growth
was slowing even before September's (interest rate) increase.
'Bearing in mind that other indicators such as growth in earnings and broad
money supply remain low and the housing market is flat, there is no evidence
to support another interest rate rise at this stage.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Lottery adverts anger charities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charity fundraisers yesterday lodged a complaint with the Advertising
Standards Authority, the advertising watchdog, about advertisements
promoting the National Lottery in last Sunday's newspapers.
The advertisements say: 'Every time you play the National Lottery, someone
else gets a better chance.' They add: 'For every pound that you spend
playing the National Lottery, at least a quarter will go to hundreds of
worthy causes throughout the UK.'
The Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, the fundraisers' professional
body, said it was concerned the advertisements might encourage people to
stop donating to charities and switch to buying lottery tickets, which go on
sale later this month.
Mr Stephen Lee, institute director, said charity fundraisers had long
supported the lottery but this support had always been based on the
principle that income from the National Lottery would be truly additional to
existing levels of support to our sector.
Research commissioned by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations
had estimated that the lottery could result in an annual loss of charitable
income of between Pounds 190m and Pounds 270m.
Mr Lee added: 'We were led to believe that the lottery will be promoted
primarily as a fun activity, not as a means of supporting charities and
voluntary organisations.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Finance sought for driverless bus network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's first guided bus system, using computer-controlled, driverless
buses, could be in operation in Guildford, Surrey, by 2002 if private-sector
finance can be raised.
The four-mile guided bus network would be powered by electricity generated
by a purpose-built power station burning domestic waste. Guildford Rapid
Transit's buses would link the town centre with the university, a sports
centre and industrial and commercial areas.
Guided buses are cheaper to install and operate than light rail or
'supertram' systems but most British cities seeking to improve their public
transport networks, including Sheffield and Manchester, have opted for
trams. Guided bus systems are working in Germany and Australia.
The Guildford project has won the backing of the government's private
finance panel, which is attempting to encourage private-sector support for
public infrastructure projects.
The promoter, Listavia International, an engineering design consultancy, is
seeking Pounds 500,000 to carry the project forward. The bus network would
cost Pounds 103m to install with the power station costing a further Pounds
65m.
The project is at the stage where it is ready to seek planning permission.
It has been funded so far by Mr Warren Lister, managing director of
Listavia, with Pounds 60,000 of his own money.
The route would run on dedicated track, much of it elevated, with buses
picking up power from cable buried under the track where there was no
pedestrian access. At street level the buses would switch to power from
on-board batteries.
A light rail system would be 2 1/2 times as expensive to install and twice
as costly to operate. In combination with the power station, which would
sell surplus electricity to the national grid and pipe waste heat to
customers through pipes in the bus trackway, the bus network would be
profitable. The project is forecast to make a return on capital of between
12 per cent and 18 per cent a year.
Although Guildford, with a catchment-area population of 125,000, would be
the smallest UK city to have a dedicated transit system, it suffers from
city centre congestion and important areas of activity, such as the
university and commercial centres, are widely dispersed.
The bus network could carry 3,000 people an hour at peak times and is
forecast to carry 13,500 people a day. It could reduce car journeys by about
20 per cent and save about 350,000 gallons of petrol a year.
A transport survey by Surrey County Council and Guildford Borough Council
backed the idea of linking the centre of town with industrial areas and the
research park.
Construction of the network would reduce the need for city centre parking
and allow the development of some of the city's parking sites which could
become the public-sector contribution to the project.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Waldegrave defends milk change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, yesterday defended
deregulation of the milk market as more supermarket groups marked up the
price of a pint by at least 2p.
Mr Waldegrave said the move to a free market inevitably meant 'winners and
losers', but the new arrangements were already 'releasing the creative
energies of the industry'. He added: 'I believe that in a comparatively
short time the change which has taken place will be seen in a more positive
light.'
The statutory Milk Marketing Board, sole buyer of milk from farmers for 61
years, was replaced yesterday by a powerful producers' co-operative, Milk
Marque, which has won control of two-thirds of supplies in England and
Wales.
Retailers yesterday blamed their higher prices on the increased cost of milk
supplied by Milk Marque to dairy manufacturers. Sainsbury, the biggest
supermarket group, joined Tesco in raising milk prices to 28p a pint, and
said butter and cheese prices would also be going up.
Safeway put its price up to 29p a pint, but will lower it to 28p today 'to
remain competitive'. Asda, the superstore chain, said its four-pint cartons
were rising by 9p, or 2.25p a pint, to 92p because the new system had
increase prices by 10 per cent.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, former agriculture minister, said in June when she
approved the new arrangements that consumers should not expect to pay more
for milk.
The agriculture ministry now says the increased prices charged to dairy
companies by Milk Marque should add no more than 0.5p to a pint. But Mr
Waldegrave denied yesterday there had been a shift in the government's view
of the benefits of deregulation.
'It's never comfortable in the short term as you move into a new era of
competition,' he said. 'But I'm a firm believer that competition is the best
way in the long term of benefiting consumer interests.'
His comments failed to placate the newly named Dairy Industry Federation,
which represents milk processors. It is preparing to submit its case
claiming abuse of monopoly power by Milk Marque to the Office of Fair
Trading.
Industry analysts expect the rise in milk prices to be short-lived. They say
prices could fall as early as next year under pressure from an increase in
milk on the European market resulting from the Gatt world trade deal, which
will limit dairy exports and increase imports into the EU.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Bank reports improved outlook on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inflation outlook has improved over the last three months and 'remains
favourable', Bank of England says in its quarterly inflation report,
released yesterday.
The Bank now expects RPI(X), the government's target measure of inflation -
which excludes mortgage interest payments - to rise slightly next year from
its current 2 per cent level but to remain below 3 per cent. By the first
half of 1996 it should be around 2.5 per cent, in line with the government's
aim of getting inflation within the lower half of its 1 per cent to 4 per
cent target range.
The Bank gives three main reasons for lowering its medium-term inflation
projection.
About half the fall in the projection is due to September's increase in base
rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent. The Bank reckons that, at the moment, a
rise in base rates has a slightly less than one-for-one effect on inflation
after two years or so. In other words, a half percentage point rise in rates
leads to a reduction of slightly under 0.5 percentage points in inflation.
The rise in rates should lead to an increase in saving, a reduction in
borrowing, and a cut in the disposable income of indebted households and
companies. The report says the effect of the move will probably be greater
than in the past, because of the continuing high level of indebtedness in
the personal sector. 'It is also possible that the signalling effect of an
increase in rates earlier in the recovery than many had expected might lower
inflation expectations', the report adds.
Recent inflation figures have been lower than expected, which has led to a
fall in the starting point of the projection.
Real average earnings have increased less rapidly than expected, reducing
companies' unit labour costs.
The Bank also says that its own measure of 'core' inflation, RPI(Y) - which
excludes indirect taxes as well as mortgage payments - is likely to be even
lower than RPI(X), reaching only just over 2 per cent in early 1996.
However, the Bank warns that its central projection is only the single most
likely outcome. 'The risk of inflation being higher than the central
projection is greater than the probability of it being lower.'
The main uncertainty for the Bank is the recent differential between
producer price inflation - the price of goods at the factory gate - which
has recently picked up speed, and retail price inflation - the price of
goods in the shops - which has remained low.
'It is not clear how far price pressures will be passed down the production
and retail chains' the report says. One uncertainty is whether increased
competition in the retail sector is structural, or cyclical. If the latter,
this may mean that retailers' margins will widen - and prices rise - as the
economy expands.
The labour market represents a further risk to the projection. The Bank has
assumed that real wages are more sensitive to the labour market than they
used to be, and that inflation expectations among wage bargainers have
fallen. 'Neither assumption is certain,' the report warns.
Finally, the Bank points to the rapid growth of narrow money, or M0, which
grew at 7.3 per cent in the year to October, well outside its 0 per cent to
4 per cent monitoring range. 'M0 growth has proved a good leading indicator
of retail inflation in the past, so the fact that it remains higher than
expected is cause for concern', it says.
The Bank also says that UK output is likely to continue growing at a rate
faster than long-run potential, and from a level closer to potential than
was previously thought. This implies that the so-called 'output gap' is
lower than the Bank thought.
The output gap is the difference between an economy's long-term trend of
output growth and its actual output. Economists believe that when actual
output is below the long term trend - that is, an output gap exists -
inflationary pressures will be subdued.
However, the Bank also noted that the output gap was likely to close at a
slower rate than in the recovery to date, implying that the rate of gross
domestic product growth - 3.6 per cent in the year to the third quarter -
might slacken.
The risks to the inflation forecast are mainly on the upside, the Bank says,
as is likely to be the case when inflation is low. Since the central
forecast is at the top of the 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent target band, this
does not leave any margin for comfort, implying interest rates will need to
rise over the coming months.
The Bank noted approvingly that the financial markets had responded
positively to the increase in base rates in September, suggesting that the
credibility of the monetary authorities has been enhanced.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Negative equity may not be as severe as recent estimates
suggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem of negative equity in the housing market - when the outstanding
mortgage on a home is larger than the value of the property  - may not be as
severe as recent estimates of its total value suggest, according to the Bank
of England's report yesterday, Motoko Rich writes.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank said the total estimated value
of negative equity - Pounds 5.6bn - obscured the fact that a high proportion
of affected households had very small gaps between mortgage and property
values.
The Bank said that of an estimated 1.1m households with negative equity,
more than one-third had shortfalls of less than Pounds 2,000, while more
than half had gaps of less than Pounds 5,000. Only 3 per cent had shortfalls
exceeding Pounds 15,000.
A 5 per cent increase in UK average house prices across all regions would
cut the total value of negative equity by about two-fifths, while a 10 per
cent increase in house prices would reduce it by more than two-thirds, the
Bank said. The south-east, Greater London, the south-west and East Anglia
accounted for 95 per cent of the total value.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Nursery education taskforce set up
</HEADLINE>

   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, told the Commons yesterday
that 'a range of options' would be considered by the government in drawing
up plans to expand nursery education.
She announced that she had set up a special taskforce in her department to
implement the promise to increase nursery provision made by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, at last month's Cons-ervative party conference.
Mrs Shephard said the commitment was to provide, over time, good quality
pre-school places for all four-year-olds whose parents wished to take them
up. The taskforce would work closely with other departments, and would be
canvassing the views of outside organisations.
Responding to Labour taunts over her failure to estimate the extra spending
likely to be involved, she stressed: 'This is a new provision, and there
will be new money.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / Labour steps up its attack on government's tax policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour marked yesterday's introduction of the new departure levy on air
travellers by stepping up its attack on the government's tax policies, David
Owen writes.
Mr Gordon Brown (above), shadow chancellor, urged the government to drop
plans to increase the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel from 8 per
cent to 17.5 per cent. He said the government could avoid the planned rise
entirely if it 'had the will'. A typical family faced further annual tax
increases of more than Pounds 360, equivalent to Pounds 7 a week, at a time
when mortgages were 'also going up'.
Government figures showed that between July and September British families
experienced the sharpest decline in living standards for 13 years, Mr Brown
said. 'No wonder the feel-good factor is proving so elusive. It is not a
feel-good factor but a feel-betrayed factor and a feel-angry factor.'
Mr Andrew Smith, shadow chief Treasury secretary, said tax increases were
coming at the same time as ministers were looking to make cuts in public
expenditure.
'There is a way to cut public expenditure. It is to get people back to
work,' he said.
The air passenger duty, set out in last year's Budget, adds Pounds 5 to the
cost of domestic and European flights and Pounds 10 to other flights.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Shift on taxation of life insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes in the taxation of life insurance, to enable UK life insurers to
compete more effectively in the rest of Europe, are to be introduced by the
government in the next finance bill.
The most important shift will affect taxation of 'services business' where
the insurer does not have to have an office in the country in which the
policyholder lives.
This has been allowed only since the changes in European law on life
insurance which took effect at the beginning of July.
The UK taxes income to policyholders as it builds up in the funds. Most
other European countries tax income when it is withdrawn from the fund and
reaches the individual.
Sir George Young, Treasury financial secretary, said the British tax system
already took account of this difference between tax regimes in the way it
treated business carried out through overseas branches of UK life insurers.
The changes represent an extension of that arrangement.
The new system will apply from the next new accounting period. For most life
insurers this will mean it will affect business written in 1995.
Another likely change, but one which has not been announced, is the closing
of a loophole in the existing system to make sure that the investment
element of offshore reinsurance does not slip through the tax net.
While these alterations will be welcomed by life insurers, they have not
resolved the wider debate within the UK life insurance industry on whether
there should be more widespread changes to harmonise UK and European tax
regimes.
The Association of British Insurers is expected to start discussions soon
with the Inland Revenue about the implication of any further fundamental
shift in the tax arrangements towards the European model.

North Korea said yesterday it had halted construction of two controversial
graphite-moderated reactors following a landmark pact with the US in which
Pyongyang agreed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear energy programme. The
agreement was signed in Geneva last month. 'We have already begun taking
practical steps to put it (the pact) into effect,' a North Korean Foreign
Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by Korean Central News Agency
monitored in Tokyo. Under the October 21 accord the US said it would
assemble an international consortium to finance the Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.5bn) construction of either one 2,000MW or two 1,000MW light-water
reactors that do not produce weapons-grade plutonium.

The Fairtrade Foundation, an organisation supported by leading development
agencies and consumer groups, yesterday launched a fair trade label for tea.
The foundation said its label would ensure better conditions and social
benefits for workers on tea estates in developing countries. 'The arrival of
these teas marks a watershed,' said Mr Phil Wells, the foundation's
standards manager. 'It is the first time that independent inspection of tea
estates, on behalf of consumers, has been allowed to take place.'
The first teas come from two estates in Sri Lanka and the Nilgiri mountains
of southern India. They are produced by Clipper Teas and will be sold by
Sainsbury, the biggest UK supermarket group, as well as smaller food shops.
Mr Wells said the foundation hoped initially to capture about 3 per cent of
the British market - which consumes 70bn cups of tea a year.

Three British tourists - Paul Ridout, Christopher Croston and Rhys Partridge
 -held hostage by Kashmiri militants were freed by Indian police yesterday,
less than 24 hours after the authorities discovered they had been kidnapped.
Two policemen and one kidnapper were killed in a 20-minute pre-dawn shootout
after Uttar Pradesh state police stormed a militant hideout in Saharanpur,
near New Delhi, to rescue the Britons. Police believe three more militants
were involved in the kidnapping and have launched a massive hunt to trace
them. The three were handed over to the British High Commission yesterday.
Al Hadeed, a hitherto unknown militant group, had left a note at the BBC
office in New Delhi on Monday afternoon, demanding the release of eight
Kashmiri militants or threatening to kill the three British hostages.
Police said they were able to locate the Britons so swiftly because of a
tip-off from Mr Bela Joseph Nuss, an American tourist whom they rescued by
coincidence in Ghaziabad on the outskirts of Delhi on Monday.

India's personal computer (PC) industry grew at an average of 50 per cent in
the first half of the current 1994-95 financial year over the same period of
1993-94, a senior industry official said yesterday. The growth rate ranged
between 30 and 70 per cent in various sections, Mr K R Palta, president of
the Manufacturers' Association of Information Technology, told a seminar on
the industry.
India's PC industry had a turnover of Rs43bn (Pounds 844m) in 1993-94, Mr
Palta said. 'If we sustain this (50 per cent) growth rate, doubling this
figure would not be difficult.' The industry was chasing an annual sales
target of 1m PCs, he said. 'It has to hit the target to survive.' Mr Richard
Watts, a senior executive of Hewelett-Packard, said. Indian PC-makers must
try to tap opportunities emerging from the linkage of digital computing with
communication and consumer electronics.

Britain yesterday condemned the killing of three western hostages, executed
by their Khmer Rouge captors, as a barbaric outrage and said it would press
Cambodia to bring those responsible to justice. The British Embassy issued a
toughly worded travel advisory requesting that their nationals avoid
Cambodia after Mr Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, confirmed that
the hostages' remains had been exhumed near Vine Mountain, about 150km south
of Phnom Penh.
Briton Mark Slater, 28, Jean-Michel Braquet, 27, from France and David
Wilson, 29, an Australian, were taken hostage by the Khmer Rouge on July 26
after a train ambush in southern Kampot province in which 13 people were
killed. Along with three ethnic Vietnamese and an unknown number of
Cambodians, the three foreigners were marched at gunpoint to a Khmer Rouge
base near Vine Mountain.

Japan Airlines (JAL) will start regular flights to Vietnam later this month

City. The Japanese Transport Ministry said yesterday it intended to grant
approval this week to the company's plan to operate twice-weekly round-trip
flights from Kansai International Airport near Osaka from November 16. In
the last year, leading European and Asian airlines, including Lufthansa, Air
France and Cathay Pacific, have begun regular services to Vietnam as the
country's economy has expanded rapidly in the wake of an accelerating
economic reform programme and the lifting of US sanctions. Japanese
corporations have been among the most active in pursuing opportunities in
the growing Vietnamese market and JAL expects to carry more than 19,000
passengers a year. The airline will use DC-10 aircraft with 218 seats on the
new route.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An increasing number of Japanese subscribers of mail order catalogues from
companies in Japan are finding their brochures mailed from Hong Kong. The
detour, prompted by Japan's expensive postal rates, means companies save 20
to 30 per cent on postage costs by sending bulk mail to other countries
where the items are remailed back to Japan.
Such schemes have hit the country's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry,
which has a monopoly on postal delivery. It has suffered losses of Y100bn
(Pounds 630m) from its postal operations in the past three years, with the
figure set to grow following a 24 per cent postal rate rise earlier this
year.
The remailing business has ballooned, and mail sent from Hong Kong to Japan
currently equals five times that sent from Japan to Hong Kong. Mailing a
postcard within Japan costs Y50 (31 pence), while it costs only Y27 (17
pence) to send a postcard from Hong Kong to Japan. Other countries with low
postage rates, including Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands, have also
become favourite remailing centres.
'Remailing is fairly widespread with heavy mailers including Japanese
companies,' says Mr Marc Fuoti, an official at Japan Marketing Data Systems,
a marketing research company. Domestic and foreign newspapers, magazines and
direct mailing companies are among the many which use remailing. The posts
ministry estimates that more than 1m items were remailed in the year to
March.
The posts ministry has tried to clamp down on remailed letters by refusing
to deliver them, charging sender companies domestic postage rates, or by
returning the letters to the sending post office. In the latest year
ministry officials charged domestic postage rates on more than 180,000 cards
and letters which had been remailed.
In another attempt to counter remailing, the Universal Postal Union, an
international regulatory body of postal trade, stipulated in September that
when a country judges a letter or card to have been remailed, it can claim
delivery costs from the postal administration of the country where the mail
was posted. But this week, taking a different tack, Mr Toyotaro Kato, chief
of the postal bureau, said the ministry planned to increase the discount
rate for bulk mail. Next spring it will ease restrictions which limit the
discount on postage to 30 per cent, he said. The postal bureau also plans to
reduce costs by cutting personnel and capital spending and hopes to
eliminate losses by the end of 1996.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Australian trade deficit worsens: September current account
shortfall of ADollars 1.8bn exceeds forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Australia clocked up a ADollars 1.809bn (Pounds 830m) current account
deficit in September, the second successive month in which it has produced
worse-than-expected trade data, although the latest figure did represent
some improvement on the ADollars 2.11bn August deficit which so badly
unnerved financial markets.
The latest deficit, calculated on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with
market forecasts of around ADollars 1.7bn. It means that, over the first
quarter of the current 1994-95 financial year, Australia's current account
deficit has reached ADollars 6.96bn, an increase of 35 per cent over the
previous year.
As analysts at Bankers Trust pointed out yesterday, extrapolating this
growth for the entire financial year would give a deficit of ADollars
22.2bn. In its May budget, the government of Prime Minister Paul Keating
estimated a current account deficit for 1994-95 of ADollars 18bn, or 4 per
cent of gross domestic product.
On the export front, the unadjusted figure was unchanged from August at
ADollars 5.29bn, with falls in gold exports and mineral fuels being offset
by higher sales of metal ores and minerals and wool. Imports eased back from
the abnormally high figure of ADollars 6.69bn in August, to ADollars 6.06bn.
The Australian bond and share markets weakened on the balance of payments
news - in spite of the distraction of yesterday's Melbourne Cup horse race -
with sentiment also discouraged by stronger-than-expected building approvals
figures.
Pessimists believe that if Australia fails to improve its trade balance
soon, it could be headed for further interest rate rises and a repeat of the
'boom and bust' episodes which have plagued it in the past.
Yesterday, however, Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, said that growth in imports
during the first quarter overall reflected the economy's move out of
recession, and the increasingly willingness by business to invest.
'While imports fell in September, strong import growth in the September
quarter is consistent with ongoing strength in domestic economic activity,'
he commented.

Israel yesterday distributed the first batch of 8,000 entry permits for
Palestinian building labourers from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The
labourers will cross the old green-line border into Israel today for the
first time since the Hamas suicide bombing which killed 22 bus passengers
and wounded 47 in Tel Aviv two weeks ago.
The number of permits will be gradually increased. The first group are
married men aged 40 or over. Before the closure about 65,000 workers
travelled daily to jobs in Israeli construction, farming and services.
The reopening eases fears that keeping the workers from their livelihood
fuelled support for the Islamic fundamentalists. In Gaza alone, unemployment
was running at up to 60 per cent even before the closure. The Palestinian
Workers Union estimated that the closure cost West Bank workers Dollars 4m
(Pounds 2.5m) a day.
At the Erez terminal between Gaza and Israel, the Israelis are investing
Dollars 30m in sophisticated computer equipment to combat a racket in forged
permits. Once it is installed, every Palestinian worker will be checked on
screen against his or her photograph and personal data.
Ministers admitted that none of the recent attacks inside Israel was
committed by permit holders. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said
yesterday the closure had been necessary to restore calm.
The Palestinian flag was raised yesterday alongside the Israeli flag at two
border crossings from Egypt and Jordan. From now on entry through Rafah and
the Allenby Bridge will be controlled jointly by Israeli and Palestinian
police.
In a complex arrangement agreed in Cairo six months ago, Israel retains
overall responsibility for security at the crossings. Residents of the Gaza
and Jericho enclaves, now ruled by Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestinian National
Authority, will be checked only by Palestinians. Residents of the
still-occupied West Bank will pass through Palestinian and Israeli counters.
Israeli citizens will be checked only by Israelis.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Islamists spurn poll offer as Algerian impasse deepens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pledge by Algerian President Liamine Zeroual to hold presidential
elections before the end of next year was yesterday dismissed as meaningless
by Islamic fundamentalists who pledged that their battle to overthrow the
regime would continue.
General Zeroual's statement on Monday night came amid worsening violence and
just 48 hours after he had publicly acknowledged that the attempts to
conduct a dialogue with the principal opposition group, the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), had come to nothing.
The admission that the talks had failed was made only six weeks after Mr
Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Benhadj, the two paramount FIS leaders, were freed
from prison and put under house arrest in an attempt to improve the
atmosphere for negotiations. However, it seems that protagonists on both
sides had done all in their power to sabotage any hint of progress.
General Mohammed Lamari, described locally as a hardline 'eradicator', was
last weekend promoted to the rank of general de corps d'armee. Gen Lamari
had warned in the latest issue of the army's monthly magazine that the fight
against the 'obscurantist and retrograde forces, traitors to their nation
and Islam' would continue 'to the very end, whatever the price and
sacrifices that would have to be paid'.
Gen Zeroual meanwhile said that the FIS's Mr Madani had refused to endorse a
call to end all violence. He also claimed that Mr Benhadj had sent two
letters to his supporters since he was put under house arrest, urging them
to 'intensify their terrorist acts'. In response Mr Rabah Khabir, spokesman
of the FIS abroad, denounced the 'threats and appeals to terror' made by the
'criminal General Lamari' and advised the head of state to resign.
The stage thus appears to be set for a further twist to the spiral of
violence which, according to western and Algerian observers has, since the
elections the now banned FIS was expected to win in January 1992, cost an
estimated 30,000 lives.
Underscoring the violence, bombs exploded in two of the nation's cemeteries
yesterday which on November 1 attract thousands of Algerians who go to
honour those who died in the eight-year-long struggle against the French
army. One blast killed five children and wounded 17 people in the western
town of Mostaganem, the official news agency APS said.
In a report last week, the human rights organisation Amnesty International
accused the Algerian security forces and armed Islamic groups of behaving
with 'total disregard of international and humanitarian law.'
Torture, which had been virtually eradicated between 1989 and 1991, 'has
become widespread in police, and gendarmerie stations and military and
security centres,' said the report. Trials had been unfair at every stage of
the proceedings and violated the most fundamental requirements of
international law.
Many observers have doubted all along that a clear line could be drawn at
this stage of the confrontation between 'moderates' and 'radicals'. Even
while agreeing on the principle of free elections, FIS leaders have always
insisted that Islamic law must prevail, something which most Algerians would
probably find unacceptable.
Algeria increasingly presents to the outside world the tragic face it did in
the late 1950s - one of blood, torture and anarchy, which no rational force
within the country seems capable of ending.
Neighbouring Morocco and Tunisia are watching the mounting violence with
ill-concealed anxiety as are Spain, Italy and France. However, whatever
their political persuasion, those outside Algeria appear to have no better
idea than Algerians themselves for a solution to the turmoil.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Tricky task to lay Mideast bank's foundations

   CASABLANCA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Many Arab and Israeli political and business leaders were hailing the
prospective Middle East and North African Development Bank as the most
'concrete' achievement of the Casablanca regional economic summit which
closed yesterday. But if so, not only is the concrete neither set nor
moulded, there will be much tricky negotiating before even the mix is agreed
upon.
This, according to yesterday's 'Casablanca declaration', will be the task of
a 'group of experts', so far unchosen, who will 'examine different options
for funding mechanisms including the creation of a Middle East and North
Africa Development Bank'. The experts are expected to meet in Washington
before the year's end and make an initial report in six months.
It will not be easy. Although the bank has general political support from
the US, the EU, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinians, speakers over
the past three days in Casablanca have canvassed a wide and sometimes
contradictory variety of possible structures, uses, lending criteria and
locations for the institution. Its creation is seen by many as addressing
political rather than economic needs, and some question the need for it -
institutions such as the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development and the Islamic Development Bank already exist.
Mr Omar Mohanna, head of corporate finance at the Cairo-based Misr Iran
Development Bank, said flatly: 'It would take a lot of time and then be a
white elephant.' He said a more practical option would be that suggested
yesterday by Mr Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, chairman of National Bank of Egypt, for
a wholly private-sector regional bank, capitalised at Dollars 500m (Pounds
316.4m) with joint and equal Arab and Israeli participation.
But to its proponents, such as Mr Michel Marto, deputy governor of Jordan's
central bank, there is a clear need for a government-backed institution.
'Every area of the world has a development bank, but we have been deprived
of one for so long. For major projects there is no institution which can do
what a development bank will. And there will be others, not in themselves
economically viable, but which must be financed for their external economic
effects.'
The bank is likely to be capitalised at Dollars 10bn, with 60 per cent held
by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. There
appears agreement that it should concentrate on financing big regional
infrastructural projects. But even among its political backers, almost every
other aspect of the bank is likely to attract considerable debate.
Egypt, for instance, is uneasy about attempts to create regional
institutions of any kind while critical regional players such as Lebanon and
Syria, which have not reached peace with Israel, remain outside what has now
become the Casablanca process.
Within the Israeli government there are differences, with Mr Jacob Frankel,
the central bank governor, arguing strongly that potential shareholders in
the bank should concentrate on making direct, immediate investments in the
region, rather than engaging in 'academic debate' over its structure.
The Palestinians are also uneasy. They say the bank's apparent role in
financing big development projects would be inappropriate to their present
small economic enclaves in Gaza and the West Bank. 'Will a bank like this
really attend to our needs? From what we hear from the Americans this bank
will not be offering any concessionary finance. But we would like to see
some benefit from it,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian minister for
economic planning.
Some Gulf states have been positive - Qatar yesterday pledged its support.
Others, in particular Saudi Arabia, are reluctant to commit money to the
bank. Britain is also understood to be suspicious of creating another
regional bank given the unhappy experiences of organisations such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Middle East Bank's
most oft-quoted model, and the African Development Bank.

How to get hard-headed businessmen to find and invest in profitable private
sector projects in the Middle East has been one of the greatest challenges
at the Casablanca Summit.
One small non-profit organisation is showing the way with big results. The
US-backed Builders for Peace seeks to match American with Palestinian
companies to invest in private businesses underwritten by the US government
in Palestinian controlled areas.
Since it was established by US Vice President Al Gore last year the group,
composed of American business leaders of Arab and Jewish origin, has
facilitated the development of nine joint venture businesses worth more than
Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) of capital investment. The projects, in hotel
construction, housing, food processing, light manufacturing, crude oil
processing and bottled water production, are expected to generate Dollars
168m in annual operating revenues and create 5,000 jobs.
Eight more projects are in the design phase following a mission to five US
cities by Palestinian businessmen sponsored by Builders for Peace.
Mr Mel Levine, a lawyer and former US congressman, said Builders for Peace
recognises the importance of private enterprise as the basis of economic
growth in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The group wants to provide a 'jump
start' for the economy and help alleviate unemployment. 'We are not
interested in politics. We are interested in business opportunities which
are designed to make a profit undertaken by people who are determined to
take a risk,' he said.
Builders for Peace works closely with two US agencies - the Overseas Private
Investment Corporation and the Trade Development Agency. The US government
has allocated Dollars 125m over five years to Opic to grant political risk
insurance, loan guarantees and small loans to US companies doing business in
Palestinian self-rule areas. Five of the nine projects developed by Builders
for Peace have received Opic assistance, giving what Mr Levine said was
'significant and tangible risk reduction'. The TDA helps joint ventures with
the preparation and evaluation of feasibility studies.
One of the nine projects under way is the construction of Gaza's first fully
serviced business hotel. The Dollars 70m hotel is being build by GRdG, a US
company, and will be managed by Marriott which may also take an equity share
in the project.
Mr Riad Karam, a director of GRdG, said Builders for Peace had been critical
to getting the project off the ground. 'They gave us a big boost, helping
with access to the US government and to Opic,' he said. 'This hotel is going
to serve as a measuring stick for successful investment as major US
companies start to get involved for the first time in the Palestinian
economy.'
Builders for Peace, backed by official risk insurance from Opic, provides a
role model for wider private sector investment in the Middle East and
answers a lot of questions raised by businessmen at Casablanca.
Many businessmen have voiced scepticism about the creation of new regional
financial institutions such as a Middle East development bank. Instead the
private sector has demanded financing mechanisms such as risk insurance,
project finance, export credits and the development of better business links
between western and Middle Eastern businessmen.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Markets hit as industry signal spurs inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US bond and share prices - and the dollar - fell yesterday, after financial
markets' fears of inflation were fuelled by evidence that US manufacturing
activity accelerated again in October.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 44.75 to close at 3,863.37 and the
30-year Treasury bond fell almost a full point.
The dollar, after losing ground in New York, opened at a new low of Y96.51
in Tokyo early today, despite intervention by the Bank of Japan to support
it.
The market setbacks came after the National Association of Purchasing
Managers said its monthly index rose to 59.7 per cent in October from 58.2
per cent in September.
The rise signalled a pick-up in business activity after a slowdown in the
third quarter. Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee,
said if the index stayed at its October level it would probably indicate a
growth rate for the overall economy of around 5.4 per cent, far in excess of
the 3.4 per cent annual rate reported last week for the third quarter.
The evidence of renewed strength in the manufacturing sector raised the
prospect that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, might raise interest
rates at its November 15 meeting by more than the half percentage point
already widely anticipated.
Yields on the 30-year Treasury bond pushed back above 8 per cent, and
interest rate analysts said the spread of more than two percentage points
between the Fed's short-term federal funds rate and the two-year Treasury
note suggested the markets were already banking on an increase next month of
at least three quarters of a percentage point.
Adding to the financial markets' concern were signs within the NAPM that
manufacturers might be feeling increasing pressure to raise their prices.
The NAPM index of prices paid for materials rose to 79.9 in October, its
highest level in six years, from 77.1 in September, with more than 70 per
cent of the purchasing executives surveyed saying they had paid higher
prices for their raw materials.
Mr Kauffman said, however, that competitive pressures were still preventing
many manufacturers from passing on price increases to their own customers.
At the same time, executives said one of their most pressing concerns was
that their suppliers' deliveries were becoming much slower. Commodities in
particularly short supply included paper and cardboard boxes, chemicals such
as ethylene, ethylene glycol and glycerine, steel, aluminium and dynamic
random access memory chips.

The US, Canada and Australia signed an agreement yesterday to ban smoking on
flights operated by their airlines among the three countries. The ban
applies to non-stop flights and will come into force in 120 days.
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said it would 'reduce a health hazard
to passengers and enhance safety. . . We expect this action to encourage
other countries to ban smoking on international flights.' He said the accord
was an important first step toward the goal of banning smoking on all
international flights by July 1996.
The agreement does not apply to flights operated via an intermediate point
in a country not a signatory to the pact or to flights chartered by a
person, company or organisation and which are not operated for paying
passengers.

<TEXT>
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico delivered his last state of the union
address yesterday, offering a robust defence of his six years in office one
month before he hands over to his successor, Mr Ernesto Zedillo. Mr Salinas
sought to answer criticisms that his government had put economic reform
before political change, arguing that democracy could not flourish when
financial disorder, deficits and inflation were exacerbated.
He said 'experience shows that abrupt political changes promoted from above
without the consensus of parties and the support of society merely lead to a
break with the old without consolidating the new.' Nevertheless, Mr Salinas
said significant democratic progress had been made during his
administration. The high turnout and generally trouble-free August
presidential elections 'mark our passage towards a better democracy'. He
accepted some responsibility for the New Year's uprising in the southern
state of Chiapas, referring to 'excessive caution' in not taking
preventative security measures.

<TEXT>
Latin America's economic outlook appears slightly more favourable than in
recent years, according to a report published today by the InterAmerican
Development Bank. A promising world outlook, private investment inflows,
likely higher prices for raw material exports and the expected ratification
of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement all added to the optimism. Growth
for the region this year was expected to be similar to 3.5 per cent in 1993,
the third consecutive year of per capita growth.
The report, Economic and Social Progress in Latin America, said regional
economic integration was 'creating favourable opportunities for Latin
American trade and investment'. Last year it noted capital inflows exceeded
outflows by Dollars 69bn. About 76 per cent of inflows into the region's
non-monetary sector - about Dollars 47bn - were in the form of direct
investment and portfolio investment.

<TEXT>
The US yesterday granted a tourist visa to Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Russia's
nationalist leader, who is scheduled to give an address on the 'New Russia'
next week in San Francisco. 'Our decision to issue Mr Zhirinovsky a visa
neither endorses his views nor supports his ambitions,' a State Department
spokesman said. 'The US government finds his views anathema.' Jewish groups
have condemned the decision.
State Department officials said the visa was for one entry only, whereas
tourist visas are customarily for six months, and the Immigration and
Naturalisation Service may decide to further limit how long Mr Zhirinovsky
stays.
Mr Zhirinovsky applied last month to visit the US for 14 days from this
Friday. He has been invited to speak at the World Affairs Council in San
Francisco next Monday on 'Creating a New Russia'. He is also hoping to visit
Los Angeles, New York and Washington.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Russia cuts off Cuba's oil supplies

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia has suspended shipments of oil to Cuba because the Caribbean state
has not met its promised level of sugar exports to Russia, Mr Oleg Davydov,
the Russian trade minister, said yesterday. The cut in supplies to a country
which once enjoyed the closest links with the former Soviet Union is
expected to further damage the recession-hit Cuban economy.
The decision is in line with Russia's attitude to other countries which once
enjoyed oil imports for barter, or at prices far below the world market
level - including former Soviet states which are now independent countries.
Mr Davydov said Russia had exported 1.5m tonnes of oil to Cuba, but had
received only 500,000 tonnes of sugar - 550,000 tonnes short of the amount
agreed. He said Russia would sell the remaining 1m tonnes of oil it had
agreed to ship to Cuba on the world market, 'adding around Dollars 120m to
the national budget'. 'If after our own sugar harvest the need arises to
import more sugar cane, then we are prepared to open negotiations again with
Cuba on this issue in 1995,' Mr Davydov said. He added, however, that the
barter of sugar for oil was unprofitable.
An official of the Cuban sugar organisation, Cubazucar, said the deal,
agreed last December, was still active - although only partly fulfilled. 'It
doesn't mean the accord has stopped.' However, Cuba would not be able to
deliver sugar until December or January, after this year's harvest.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Troops pack an uncertain punch in Rio: Patrick McCurry in
Sao Paulo explains why Brazil's decision to send in the military may not
work
</HEADLINE>

The decision to send in the military to control Rio de Janeiro's largely
discredited police forces follows mounting media pressure for action against
violence in the city. But there is little expectation that the move will do
much to solve the city's problems of violence, corruption and drug
trafficking.
Rio state Governor, Mr Nilo Batista, agreed on Monday to allow the military
to direct the united operations of the state-controlled military and civil
police forces in city. There had been speculation if he refused President
Itamar Franco would seek a 'state of defence' decree, allowing federal
troops to be sent to the city.
The move brings unwelcome reminders of Brazil's two decades of military
rule, which ended in the mid-1980s, although most observers believe that
military leaders have not sought a role in combating heavily armed drug
traffickers in the city's warren-like hillside shanty towns.
It is hard to know if violence is on the rise because of the lack of
reliable statistics, but media pressure for action has increased following a
number of violent incidents in the last two weeks.
These include a revenge attack by 120 police that left 13 shanty town
residents dead, the death of a 15-year-old girl from stray police bullets
and the killing of a multinational executive by car thieves.
Another incident that has put pressure on the government is the widespread
fraud uncovered during congressional elections in Rio de Janeiro on October
3.
Drug traffickers and illegal gambling racketeers - widely believed to have a
large portion of the state-controlled police in their pay - are thought to
be involved.
According to Mr Paulo Calmon, a political scientist, action is being taken
now because the presidential election, held on October 3, is out of the way.
'There seems to be a consensus that now is the time for action, so that
there is no major crisis awaiting (president elect) Fernando Henrique
Cardoso when he takes office next January.' Mr Cardoso has said he supports
sending in troops 'if necessary' and that Rio is suffering 'an undeclared
civil war.'
Some analysts believe Mr Cardoso's candidate for the second-ballot election
of the state governorship, to be held on November 15, has been benefiting
from the controversy. 'The government could easily wait until after the
second ballot. There is no civil war,' says Mr Emir Sader, a Rio-based
academic specialising in research into violence.
He accepts, nevertheless, that there has been a deterioration in the
situation in recent months.
It not clear whether troops will be sent into the shanty towns, although
they would probably be welcomed by many residents there as protectors. There
is always the risk they would be corrupted in the same way as their police
colleagues if they stayed for a prolonged period.
The problems of crime and violence are widely viewed as the result of Rio de
Janeiro's economic decline starting with its replacement in 1960 as capital
by the city of Braslia. The decision of former governor Leonel Brizola to
restrict police activity in the shanty towns in the 1980s - after complaints
from residents about police behaviour - allowed drug dealers to grow into a
parallel authority.
'Nothing has been done in the last 15 years to tackle Rio's social and
economic problems and now they are trying to correct the situation in a few
weeks,' says Mr Sader.

FT  02 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): From roguery and
villainy to an ideological battleground - Two Maryland races, one on
unfamiliar ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maryland has two important state-wide elections this year. While the one
featuring two nationally known names - for the US Senate - has been
something of a damp squib, that for governor, between candidates whose
recent careers have been spent in the relative obscurity of local
government, has turned into an ideological fireworks display.
The second race pits Mr Parris Glendening, 52-year-old chief executive of
Prince George's County in the Washington suburbs, against Mrs Ellen
Sauerbrey, 57, once a biology teacher and for most of the last 20 years a
Republican state legislator. He is a conventional progressive Democrat, she
is the new pin-up candidate of the Republican right.
The contrast with the Senate race could hardly be more marked. In the
Democratic corner stands Senator Paul Sarbanes, seeking a fourth term, and
in the Republican Mr Bill Brock, once a senator from Tennessee and
previously US trade representative and chairman of the national Republican
party.
Both are running as the souls of relative moderation, in Mr Brock's case to
the point of half-renouncing a staunchly conservative political past.
Maryland's political history may be littered with rogues and villains - two
former governors, Mr Marvin Mandel, a Democrat, and Mr Spiro Agnew, the
Republican who became vice president, both faced criminal charges - but it
has never been known as a battleground for political ideology.
Its first settlers from Britain in the 1630s were Roman Catholics sent by
Lord Baltimore to escape Puritan repression and it was the first colony to
establish in law the principle of religious tolerance. Today, the mayor of
Baltimore, Mr Kurt Schmoke, is black, the outgoing Democratic governor, Mr
Donald Schaefer, endorsed President George Bush in 1992, and the state has
tough laws against guns and protecting the right to abortion.
Its suburbs form part of the Washington metropolitan area and Annapolis, its
picturesque capital and home of the US Naval Academy, perches on the
Chesapeake Bay, but its heart and soul remains the revived industrial port
city of Baltimore. Its economy is diverse and, some pockets of inner-city
and rural poverty excepted, prosperous.
Mrs Sauerbrey is in many respects an unlikely candidate for Maryland. She
was not even expected to be on the ballot next week, but in the September
Republican primary upset Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley, no mean
conservative herself, for the right to oppose Mr Glendening, who enjoyed a
much easier passage.
She did so primarily on the back of her proposal to cut state income taxes
by 24 per cent over the next four years and to freeze spending on virtually
everything. As the campaign unfolded she also promised to roll back
environmental regulations and to divert tax revenues to private schools.
With the apparently successful tax-cutting example of Governor Christie
Whitman of New Jersey fresh in the national mind, she became the instant
darling of the conservative movement.
This being 1994, the year of the uncivil elections, Mrs Sauerbrey and Mr
Glendening, who has Mrs Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, eldest daughter of Robert
F Kennedy, as a running mate, were soon mincing no words, in commercials and
in debates. She slammed him as as yet another 'tax and spend' Democrat,
while he hammered her as outside the Maryland mainstream.
The polling evidence is that Mrs Sauerbrey's assault is not working. A
Washington Post poll two weeks ago gave Mr Glendening a 53-37 per cent lead,
with 10 per cent undecided. Another Post survey published yesterday found
him ahead by nearly nine-to-one among black voters, nearly 25 per cent of
the electorate.
This is far in excess of the usual Democratic margin and was attributed to
his successful 12-year management of Prince George's County, the most
racially diverse in the state. Mrs Sauerbrey held a 46-44 lead among whites
but had not shown signs of breaking out of her base in the Baltimore suburbs
and in conservative rural areas.
On the Senate side, Mr Sarbanes held a 57-32 point edge over Mr Brock in a
Baltimore Sun poll two weeks ago and is generally reckoned comfortably
ahead. A Sarbanes campaign is normally low-keyed but in common with the
times he has accused his opponent of being a carpetbagger, of a poor
attendance record while in the Senate and of taking on Japanese companies as
clients as soon as he finished his stint as trade representative in the
Reagan administration.
Mr Brock, who ran a legendarily dirty campaign in Tennessee to oust Senator
Albert Gore, father of the vice president, in 1970, has seemed passive in
response, excepting conventional attacks on the Sarbanes record as a big
spender. His hopes of being the first senator to represent two different
states this century hang by a thread.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US manufacturing activity accelerated again in October, according to a
survey of industry purchasing managers, arousing new fears in the financial
markets that inflation might be building up steam.
The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its monthly index rose
to 59.7 per cent in October from 58.2 per cent in September, signalling a
pick-up in business activity after a slowdown in the third quarter.
Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee, said if the
index stayed at its October level it might indicate a growth rate for the
overall economy of around 5.4 per cent, far in excess of the 3.4 per cent
annual rate reported last week for the third quarter.
Bond and stock markets both fell in response to the survey yesterday, as
analysts suggested the evidence of renewed strength in the manufacturing
sector might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its
November 15 meeting by more than the half percentage point already widely
anticipated.
The yields on the 30-year US Treasury bond pushed back above 8.0 per cent
again, and by noon the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 31.63 to
3,876.49.
With the gap between the Federal funds rate and the yield on two-year
Treasury notes now more than 2 full percentage points, the markets appear to
have built in a Fed increase of at least  3/4 percentage point.
Adding to the financial markets' concerns were signs within the NAPM that
manufacturers might be feeling increasing pressure to raise their prices.
The association's index of prices paid for materials rose to 79.9 in
October, its highest level in six years, from 77.1 in September, with more
than 70 per cent of the purchasing executives surveyed saying they had paid
higher prices for their raw materials.
Mr Kauffman said competitive pressures were still preventing many
manufacturers from passing on price increases to their customers.
Executives said one of their most pressing concerns was that suppliers'
deliveries were becoming much slower. Commodities in particularly short
supply included paper and cardboard boxes, chemicals such as ethylene,
ethylene glycol and glycerine, steel, aluminium and dynamic random access
memory chips.
US September construction spending rose 1.6 per cent, the largest rise since
a 2.1 per cent in March, Reuter reports from Washington. Wall Street
economists had forecast September construction spending would rise 0.2 per
cent.

The US Federal Communications Commission has received applications from 74
companies, consortia and individuals to bid next month in its auction of
broadband wireless telecommunications frequencies, which it expects to be
the largest ever auction of public sector assets.
The licences are to run the personal communications services which are
expected to compete with today's cellular telephone technology.
Applicants, who need not necessarily bid and must still make an up-front
payment by November 18 if they want to take part in the auction, include all
the regional Bell telephone companies, long distance telephone companies
such as AT&amp;T and Sprint, and cable television groups such as Cox, TCI and
Comcast.
But other companies such as EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General
Motors, and Excelsior Parking have also applied to take part in the auction.
EDS submitted applications mostly in small and medium-sized markets,
avoiding large metropolitan areas.
So has Mr Craig McCaw, the founder of McCaw Communications, the leading
cellular telephone company which he sold to AT&amp;T. In general, Mr McCaw chose
to bid, through his company ALAACR Communications, for markets in which he
knew he would not be competing with AT&amp;T, but both are listed as applying
for the Buffalo market.
Some 23 bidders submitted incomplete applications, and have a week to amend
their filings.
The FCC conducted its first auction of spectrum frequencies in July, raising
Dollars 617m in bids for narrow band frequencies for advanced paging
services - although several of the largest bidders later defaulted.
Another auction for regional advanced paging licences is now in its 25th
round of bidding, with high bids totalling Dollars 394m.
The broad band auction, due to start on December 5, is expected to be much
bigger than these and could take more than a month to complete. The FCC's
innovative auction rules allow applicants to bid by computer on all the
available licences at the same time, so they can change their bidding
strategy to target a different region if they see their first choice as too
expensive.
The 51 regional markets attracted an average of 26.5 applicants each, with
20 companies submitting applications for Los Angeles and 22 for New York.
Applicants for the large New York market will have to pay an upfront fee of
Dollars 15.8m by November 18, while the 34 bidders for the tiny American
Samoa market will have to pay only Dollars 28,200. A company bidding for
nationwide licences would have to pay Dollars 150m upfront.
In the past, the US has granted frequencies either on the basis of public
hearings or by lottery. The auction is expected not only to raise money for
the government, but to bring down prices for the consumer by awarding
competing licences in each area.
'We have made two fundamental changes: we are not giving away the rights,
and we are not giving away monopolies,' said Mr Reed Hundt, the FCC
chairman.

The administration of the Cayman Islands is again seeking US assistance in
ridding the British colony in the north-western Caribbean of 1,200 Cuban
refugees, most of whom have arrived in the islands since August. A
delegation from the Cayman Islands has gone to Washington to ask the US
government either to give the refugees visas to enter the US, or to
transport them to refugee centres in Panama or at Guantanamo Bay, the US
naval base in southern Cuba.
The Caymanian administration says it has exhausted this year's budget for
taking care of the refugees, most of whom are living in tents. It had
earlier said it would repatriate the Cubans, but few among the 1,174
refugees appear either willing to go home or to be transferred to Panama or
to Guantanamo Bay.

Canada plans to dilute its traditional hospitality towards immigrants under
a new long-term policy unveiled yesterday, reports Bernard Simon from
Toronto.
Besides cutting the 1995 immigration quota by about 12 per cent, Mr Sergio
Marchi, immigration minister, announced tighter curbs on family members
seeking to join relatives already in Canada.
The government will in future place a greater emphasis on attracting
entrepreneurs and other independent immigrants with skills or wealth to
contribute to the economy. The refugee quota will rise by as much as
three-quarters to 24,000-32,000 a year.
Studies indicate that new settlers in the family reunification category,
especially parents and grandparents, place a relatively heavy burden on
health and social services.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: MPs expose 70-year trail of export credit
errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department has said administrative
mistakes which caused it to make overpayments of Pounds 83m (Dollars 131m)
to British exporters since 1975 may have been going on for more than 70
years.
The admission is contained in a report yesterday from the House of Commons
Public Accounts Committee. It severely criticises the ECGD for sloppy
administration, poor internal controls and slowness in deciding whether to
discipline staff responsible for the mistakes.
The Department of Trade and Industry has already decided not to try to
recover the overpayments, most of which arose from insurance of export
orders from Nigeria.
The committee said the overpayments, first disclosed by a National Audit
Office report in February, had occurred because ECGD officials had
misinterpreted policies governing recoveries on supplier credit insurance to
exporters.
After the department took legal advice, its London office had applied the
correct approach since 1990, However, its older Cardiff office - which now
belongs to NCM, the Dutch export credit insurer - continued to misinterpret
the rules until 1992.
The ECGD told the committee that though overpayments had been traced back to
1975, it was unsure when the misinterpretations began and 'believed it
possible' that they had taken place since 1919.
The committee also said the ECGD had given 'conflicting evidence at
different times' about how far its inability to provide a more accurate
figure for overpayments was due to its destruction of case files.
The committee expressed concern that internal audit procedures had not
discovered the two offices' different methods, which had been detected only
in 1992 by independent consultants brought in to computerise the department.
The committee expressed surprise that the ECGD had not sought proper legal
advice on how to interpret a new form of credit guarantee introduced in
1975. It said this had produced a 'sloppy system', made worse by lack of
co-ordination between the London and Cardiff offices.
The report said the overpayments had prompted the ECGD to review its
operations and strengthen links between its administrative staff and
lawyers.
However, the committee expressed concern that almost two years after the
differences in the ECGD's methods had been discovered, the department had
still not decided whether to take disciplinary action against its staff.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Uruguay deal will boost US output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Business Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US economic output will be boosted by about Dollars 65bn a year by 2004 as a
result of higher efficiency generated by trade liberalisation agreed in the
Uruguay Round, according to a study by the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics.
The institute says tariff reductions planned in the round will increase US
net exports by Dollars 19.1bn and create 265,000 jobs by 2000.
The authors reject as groundless objections by some members of Congress that
US sovereignty will be undercut by the new World Trade Organisation, which
is due to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on January 1.
Published barely a month before Congress reconvenes for what promises to be
a close vote on ratification of the Uruguay Round, the study will provide
ammunition for the Clinton administration in its efforts to secure approval
of the deal.
The study says that if tariff cuts agreed in the round are phased in over
five years from next year, they will lead to increases of Dollars 41.9bn in
US exports and Dollars 22.7bn in imports by 2000.
US consumers would gain Dollars 11.7bn a year in the same period from lower
prices from reduced tariffs on imports, while US exporters would gain about
Dollars 10.9bn from improved opportunities on foreign markets. US tariff
revenue, meanwhile, would fall by Dollars 11.4bn.
By 2004, tariff cuts, the benefits of planned liberalisation of textile
trade and dynamic economic gains generated by the round should add Dollars
65bn to US output, or roughly 1 per cent of gross domestic product.
The authors say the forecasts are conservative, because they exclude the
effects of planned liberalisation in world agricultural trade and public
procurement, and of possible agreements in the WTO to free international
competition in services.
They say that though the Uruguay Round promises to produce a modest increase
in US employment, its most important result will be to stimulate the
creation of more productive and better paid jobs.
Fears that the WTO will reduce US sovereignty are misplaced, they say,
because the organisation must act by consensus and cannot impose decisions
on the US which conflict with its national laws.
Furthermore, the controversial Section 301 provision of US trade law, which
allows Washington to retaliate against other countries' trade practices when
they fall outside Gatt obligations, is fully consistent with the WTO. The
study warns, however, that once the WTO is set up, its members must act
swiftly to guard against the risk of backsliding into protectionism. The

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan to press Apec on trade
liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan will signal its clear support for a degree of regional trade
liberalisation at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum summit in
Bogor, Indonesia, in two weeks' time.
It will press for a middle way between the free trade zone advocated by the
US, Canada and Australia and the loose regional alliance preferred by east
Asian members of the 17-nation forum, said Mr Tetsuya Endo, Japanese
ambassador for Asia-Pacific co-operation.
Until recently, Tokyo has taken a mildly negative back seat at Apec,
reflecting a split between the foreign ministry, slow to accept the forum's
value, and the ministry of international trade and industry, eager to push
Apec as a trade and investment opportunity. Support from Indonesia, this
year's holder of Apec's rotating chairmanship, is one factor in tipping the
government in favour of Apec.
The summit is expected to make a commitment to liberalise trade between Apec
members by a target date, possibly 2020. Japan is eager to see Apec,
representing half the world's trade, make this modest step forward from the
vague accord of the first leaders' summit in Seattle last year, Mr Endo
argued.
But for agreement on a liberalisation deadline, details of what free trade
entails must be left for later summits, said Mr Endo. That would leave it up
to Japan, which takes the Apec chairmanship in 1995, to produce practical
free trade steps in time for next year's summit in Osaka. 'Whether we like
it or not, the burden will fall on Japan,' said Mr Endo.
Japan 'is not adamant at all on the creation of a free trade area,' but does
support a first small step in that direction, the unconditional granting of
Most Favoured Nation trading status between Apec countries, he said.
Tokyo shares some of the US preference for encouraging Apec to develop into
a trade negotiating forum, but only for settling trade disputes that cannot
be resolved bilaterally or by the new World Trade Organisation. A
three-layered world trade system, of the WTO, regional bodies like Apec and
bilateral relations, was 'best for Apec and Japan,' said Mr Endo.
Japan accepts that moves to free trade in Apec need to be accompanied by
government and private sector efforts to help poorer members to modernise,
likely to be an important point of the Bogor talks, said Mr Endo. Tokyo and
other rich members will push for the Apec summit to agree on more concrete
steps, such as a code on cross-border investment rules. This is likely to be
agreed by trade and foreign ministers before the leaders' summit. They are
also expected to set up a committee to work for common Apec-wide standards
for manufactured goods and food and joint customs procedures.

FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US and Japan extend deadline on glass
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese and US trade officials yesterday said that few outstanding issues
remained over measures to improve foreign access to Japan's market for flat
glass, despite the failure of talks to secure an accord.
Japanese officials were confident that an accord could be reached after
further negotiations, since the two sides have already agreed the basic
principles for opening Japan's flat glass market to imports.
'The calendar has just been extended,' said Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's
minister for international trade and industry, who said the negotiations
would continue later. 'We made some progress but . . . some technical and
practical problems remain,' the trade minister added.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, also put a positive spin on
the failure to reach agreement within the 30-day deadline which expired on
Monday.
Discussions, he said, would continue 'for a limited period of time.'
Progress had been made, and only a few technical and substantive issues
remained outstanding.
Japan has agreed to promote the use of foreign-made glass in some
government-funded facilities which would serve as model projects.
There is also broad agreement on the use of objective criteria to measure
progress in import penetration. Differences remain, however, over whether
the objective criteria should be forward-looking, as the US hopes, or should
only measure past developments, as the Japanese insist.
Japanese officials are concerned that forward-looking measures could turn
into restrictive targets aimed at ensuring a specific market share for
foreign products in the domestic glass market.
Mr Steve Farrar of Guardian Glass said the US glass industry was
'disappointed' in the failure to reach agreement in the month but urged
continuing talks over the next few weeks.
If agreement is not reached soon, however, Mr Farrar urged the bringing of a
Section 301 case, which provides for sanctions at the end of a year of
investigation and negotiation.
US officials have been concerned about the slow pace of negotiations since
agreement was reached in principle on October 1. In announcing the
agreement, Mr Kantor said he expected 'three-quarters of the 100 largest
Japanese wholesalers and glaziers would obtain 30 to 40 per cent of their
flat glass from non-traditional sources, a mixture of both foreign and
domestic'.
Mr Hashimoto subsequently wrote to Mr Kantor challenging this. 'I hope this
is some sort of misinterpretation of your remarks,' he wrote. 'But I would
like to urge you to refrain from making such remarks which could be
interpreted in effect as requesting numerical targets. Such a comment
clearly makes our future talks more difficult.'
While the latest round of talks did not produce results, Japanese officials
remained optimistic that agreement could be reached. Trade in glass products
is not an emotive issue and it is unlikely that US trade officials would
risk aggravating tensions with Japan over a sector in which it usually has a
bilateral trade surplus, a trade official said. Last year Japan bought
Y3.4bn (Dollars 34m) more flat glass from the US than it exported there,
according to Japanese government trade statistics.
The situation was less promising in the parallel talks on vehicles and
vehicle parts. Negotiations have not been resumed since the US cited Japan's
vehicle parts after-sales market as being characterised by 'unfair and
discriminatory trade practices' and unilaterally began an investigation
under Section 301 of its trade act.
Mr Hashimoto yesterday reiterated that the use of Section 301 remained a
major obstacle to resuming negotiations on these markets.
'Section 301 is still in effect. It is difficult to know what to believe
when on the one hand they are saying 'we are going to hit you' and on the
other they expect friendly talks,' he said.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Russian PM calls off visit to Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, last night called off a
two-day visit to Poland due to start tomorrow because of an 'unsatisfactory
response' from the Polish authorities to complaints that Polish police had
beaten Russians in Warsaw over a week ago.
A statement from Mr Chernomyrdin's office said that 'a new date for the
visit will depend on the position taken by the Polish authorities'.
The visit has been put off in spite of the planned signing of a
multi-billion dollar deal to construct a gas pipeline which would allow
Russia to escape from its dependence on Ukraine for the transport of one of
its most valuable exports to the west.
The row, which has worsened in the past two days, concerns an incident in
Warsaw's eastern railway station on October 23. According to the Russian
side, several Russian passengers were beaten by Polish police and jailed.
Polish press reports quoted the police as saying they had had to use force
after the Russians, who had been robbed by Russian gangsters, locked
themselves in their train compartment and used emergency brakes to prevent
their international train to Berlin from departing.
Mr Artur Michalski, a senior diplomat at Warsaw's embassy in Moscow, said
last night that the Polish note, sent yesterday to the Russian foreign
ministry, had expressed 'regret' at the incident. However, it had underlined
that the Polish government could not comment further while an investigation
was proceeding.
Mr Michalski stressed that the Russian consul in Warsaw had been informed
immediately about the incident on the day it happened. Because it had not
been a working day, however, a representative of the Russian consulate had
not contacted the police or the Russians detained by them until the next
day.
The incident has become a cause celebre in the Russian press and in
political circles, with a range of public figures calling on Mr Chernomyrdin
to cancel his trip.
Mr Chernomyrdin had been due to sign an agreement on the inauguration of
parallel gas pipelines from Poland through Belarus to the Yamal peninsula in
northern Siberia, where there is a huge natural gas field. The project is
said to be worth Dollars 40bn (Dollars 2.5bn of it in Poland) and to be
capable of handling 67bn cubic metres of gas worth Dollars 5.5bn a year.
The line will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, through which the only
pipeline carrying Russian gas to the markets of central and western Europe
now passes - and which, in the past, has proved vulnerable to Ukrainian
pressure when Moscow has tried to cut supplies to Ukraine because of its
failure to repay debts.
According to today's issue of the Sevodnya daily newspaper, the Russian
company Gasprom and the Polish company Europol have already reached
agreement on the construction of 665km of parallel pipes in Poland. A
separate accord has been reached with Belarus to build 575km of pipelines.
The incident illustrates the vulnerability of the Russian government to
growing nationalist pressure - and to the increasing number of incidents
involving Russians and Poles, especially in the street markets in Warsaw and
other cities.

approved, a tax write-off which was demanded by a Jutland savings bank,
Sparekassen Nordjylland, as the price for taking over most of the assets of

General Matvei Burlakov, deputy Russian defence minister and the centre of
press and political allegations of massive corruption in the Western Group
of the armed forces which he had commanded until September of this year, was
sacked by President Boris Yeltsin last night. The presidential decree said
that Gen Burlakov, 59, had been fired 'to preserve the honour of the Russian
armed forces and its leaders . . . in connection with investigations which
are currently in progress'. The sacking comes two weeks after the murder of
a young journalist, Dmitry Kholodov, who had been investigating the
allegations of corruption and had already published details of it. The move
puts in doubt the future of Gen Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister,
who had strongly defended Gen Burlakov and refuted the allegations of
corruption.

Canal-Plus, the French media group, is expected to be the first European
broadcaster to launch a digital television service when it starts digital
transmissions late next year. Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES), the
Luxembourg-based company that operates the Astra satellites, said yesterday
that it had signed a contract with Canal-Plus for the French company to
relay a digital service from the Astra 1E and Astra 1F satellites, which
will be launched in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Digital television, which
enables broadcasters to relay higher quality screen images and to transmit
up to 10-times the usual number of channels from each satellite, is already
on stream in the US, where Direct TV began digital transmissions this
summer. Almost all the main European broadcasters have expressed interest in
launching digital services over the next decade, but Canal-Plus is the only
European broadcaster to have committed itself to booking satellite space for
its forthcoming service. The French company, according to SES, could start
digital transmissions from late next year when descrambling devices will be
available.

The war in Bosnia was in danger of escalating yesterday amid reports that
rebel Serb forces in Croatia have mobilised to aid their ethnic allies
across the frontier and Bosnian Croats have joined a Moslem offensive in the
north-west.
Some 2,000 Serb fighters from Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in
Croatia, are ready to cross into neighbouring Bosnia, say local Serb
leaders. Bosnian government troops last week launched an offensive from
Bihac, the north-western Moslem enclave which is also a UN-designated safe
area, gaining some 250 sq km of territory from their Serb foes.
The threat of Serb retaliation yesterday increased with reports that Bosnian
Croats have joined Moslem troops in the region. 'They have taken up Serb
positions on the west bank of the Una river, south of Bihac town,' said Mr
Paul Risley, UN spokesman in Zagreb. HVO troops, Bosnian Croat forces, had
even engaged Krajina fighters in Croatia itself, along the western flank of
the Bihac pocket, said Mr Risley. The HVO had also moved troops to the
confrontation line near Kupres, in central Bosnia, where Moslem forces had
also gained ground against the Serbs. The stepped-up involvement of the HVO
will make it more difficult for international mediators who have been trying
to broker a deal between Zagreb and Krajina Serbs and may also put Serbia's
President Slobodan Milosevic under pressure to intervene.

FT  02 NOV 94 / MMM shares 'suspended' by Mavrodi: Finance company chief
hopes poll victory will ensure immunity from prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergei Mavrodi, head of the MMM finance company and newly-elected deputy
to the Russian state duma (lower house) yesterday moved quickly to escape
his obligations to thousands of shareholders who had bought shares in his
pyramid selling operation earlier this year - apparently banking on the
immunity from prosecution which a deputy's status confers.
An announcement from MMM said that the shares issued earlier this year were
'temporarily suspended' from November 1 until January 1. This was interpeted
by the crowd of some 3,000 massed outside the company's offices as a
declaration of their worthlessness. The announcement said the decision had
been taken 'because of the concentration of the shares in the hands of
middlemen and speculators'.
The MMM chief won his duma seat in a by-election on Sunday for the Moscow
suburb of Mytishchi. He did so in part by promising to spend Dollars 10m of
his own money on improvements to the town, in part by presenting himself as
a victim of government repression at a time when the public view of the
authorities is very low.
He has also begun to issue new shares with a face value of Rbs1,000,
promising that they will reach the level of Rbs125,000 held by the old
shares before they crashed in the summer. The collapse followed government
statements that MMM was shaky and the arrest of Mr Mavrodi on charges of tax
evasion.
Though Mr Mavrodi and his entourage have trumpeted his immunity since the
results of the election became known on Monday, the authorities are refusing
to drop the case which concerns alleged tax evasion by his Invest-Consulting
company. Mr Alexander Borisov, a spokesman for the Moscow tax police, said
last night that the case concerned an alleged non-payment of Rbs70bn in
taxes and that it would be continued.
Mr Mavrodi had been supported in the campaign by the ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democratic party led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who personally
toured the voting stations on Sunday to ensure that the election was fair.
In an interview yesterday, Mr Konstantin Borovoi, leader of the Economic
Freedom party who came third in the race, said the result showed that 'a new
and dangerous factor has appeared in politics - the LDP plus money'.
The victory of Mr Mavrodi 'is a sign that some businessmen have begun to
help the LDP with their money'. This, he said, was because they had ceased
to trust the government and were now looking for an alternative source of
power.
Mr Borovoi said that he would protest against the result of the by-election
on a range of irregularities.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Bossi threatens budget debate fight: The Northern League
leader's war of nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The unity of Italy's fractious right-wing coalition faces a vital test later
this week when discussion of the 1995 budget begins in the chamber of
deputies.
Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, has been waging a
war of nerves with his coalition partners during a month of haggling over
budget details at the commission stage. Now Mr Bossi has pledged to raise
the stakes by threatening to embarrass the government in the chamber.
The League has the largest number of deputies in the coalition, and in
commission negotiations sided on several occasions with the opposition
against the government. However, the League's much publicised threat to
reduce the scope of pension cuts - a central element of the planned saving
in public spending - was never carried out.
The budget commission approved the final form of the 1995 budget, plus a
special accompanying law, on Monday.
This respects the government's original broad objective of finding L50,000bn
(Pounds 20bn) in fresh revenues and, through spending cuts, to hold the 1995
public sector deficit down to 8 per cent of GDP.
Mr Bossi has nevertheless hinted that the skirmishes in the commission were
merely a foretaste of what would occur in open parliamentary debate.
He is still furious that his candidates for one of the two Italian
commissioners to the EU were overlooked last weekend. Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the prime minister, snubbed the League and chose Ms Emma Bonino, pushed by
the small Radical grouping of Mr Marco Panella.
The League leader's behaviour is conditioned by a growing fear that he is
being outmanoeuvred and marginalised within the coalition by Mr Berlusconi's
Forza Italia movement and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr
Gianfranco Fini.
Forza Italia and the MSI/National Alliance are moving increasingly close
together. As a result the League risks losing its federalist identity within
the coalition, while being dragged too much to the right.
The fight to retain the League's identity becomes increasingly important as
limited local elections are scheduled for the end of the month.
Within the League, Mr Bossi's intemperate behaviour and constant fights with
his coalition allies have begun to cause serious strains.
Three deputies have already left the League parliamentary group to sit as
independents and more are threatening to desert.
Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and senior League figure in the
government, shows signs of growing impatience with Mr Bossi.
Mr Maroni's skilful diplomacy has been largely responsible for not only
mediating between Mr Bossi and Mr Berlusconi, but also for keeping the
League MPs together. But this week he openly criticised Mr Bossi for making
life so difficult for the League ministers by his sniping at the government
from outside.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Gonzalez in row over corruption claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez was yesterday at the centre of a row over
reports in the Madrid newspaper El Mundo that allegedly link his
brother-in-law to a speculative property deal in Seville, home town of the
Spanish Socialist leader.
Mr Gonzalez was also seeking to distance his government from Swiss-born
Italian businessman Mr Ferdinando Mach di Palmestein who was arrested in
Paris at the weekend on warrants issued by Milan's anti-corruption
magistrates. Mr Mach di Palmestein is reported to have acted as a middleman
between the Rome and Madrid governments in Italian takeovers of Spanish
companies.
Speaking at a news conference in Casablanca on Monday, where he was
attending the Middle East and North Africa economic summit, Mr Gonzalez
fiercely denied allegations that his brother-in-law, Mr Francisco Palomino,
a Seville businessman, had made Pta346m (Pounds 1.7m) last year when he sold
an industrial estate that he had acquired in 1989 from an agency of the
public works ministry.
Mr Gonzalez said the allegations were a 'calumny'. He said the report on Mr
Palomino's property deal was 'false and was published in the knowledge it
was false'.
The prime minister also said that press reports about Mr Mach di
Palmestein's dealings with the Spanish government and the ruling Socialist
party were part of the same 'campaign of lies and defamation' as well as an
attempt to 'copy certain models from abroad'.
Yesterday Mr Palomino said he had not been connected to the property company
at the time when it had bought and later sold the industrial estate in
Seville.
But El Mundo printed documents purportedly signed by Mr Palomino that
apparently link him to both the acquisition of the property from a real
estate agency called Sepes, which is controlled by the public works
ministry, and to its subsequent disposal at a high price to a subsidiary of
the big domestic construction company, Dragados y Construccions.
The new twist to the allegations provided by El Mundo's publication of
documents could prove highly embarrassing for the prime minister.
Mr Palomino was involved in considerable controversy during the 1980s when
he attempted to develop coastal land close to a large wild life resort south
of Seville.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Economic watch: Finnish unemployment rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finnish unemployment rose to 17.7 per cent in September from 17.1 per cent
in August, breaking a downward trend which has seen joblessness fall from a
peak of more than 20 per cent at the start of the year. The figures confirm
the recovery in the economy after three years of recession, but emphasise
the gulf between the booming export sector and the still sluggish domestic
economy. Industrial employment is rising, but the situation has yet to
improve in the retail, construction and service sectors. Finland has
experienced one of Europe's worst unemployment crises because of the loss of
vital trade with the former Soviet Union, the bursting of a huge 1980s
credit boom and international recession. However, the situation has helped
to keep the lid on inflation. The Bank of Finland said yesterday there were
no signs that core inflation would be above the target level of 2 per cent,
but uncertainties, including autumn pay talks, meant no easing of monetary
policy was possible.
Denmark's current account surplus for July fell very slightly to DKr2.60bn
(Pounds 271m) compared with a surplus of DKr2.56bn a year earlier. In
August, the current account surplus also declined slightly to DKr4.1bn from
DKR4.3bn for the same month last year.
Romanian industrial output in September rose 2.8 per cent after falling 1.4
per cent in August. It rose 6.0 per cent year-on-year.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Brussels lowers its sights over EU employment rules - David
Goodhart, Labour Editor, chronicles a marked retreat by the Commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Padraig Flynn, the European Union's pragmatic social affairs
commissioner, unveils new plans for Europe-wide employment legislation early
next year, the UK government will almost certainly lay about them with
relish.
But the predictably noisy response will not disguise a marked retreat by
Brussels from rule-making in employment. The scheme Mr Flynn is working on
will be a mere echo of the aggressive 'social action programme' published by
the European Commission in 1989.
Already, the new emphasis on job creation of last December's white paper on
employment by the outgoing Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, and Mr
Flynn's own, more recent, one on European social policy has led to a more
cautious attitude towards further Europe-wide legislation.
Insiders now talk about turning DG5 - the Commission's social and employment
affairs directorate-general - into Europe's employment 'think-tank',
spreading the latest ideas about job creation, rather than Europe's 'labour
ministry' imposing new regulations.
This would suit Mr Flynn. Ireland's only commissioner, he held on to the
social affairs job last weekend when Mr Jacques Santer, the incoming
Commission president, redistributed portfolios. He does not have strong
convictions on most employment issues. He is happy to move with the less
regulatory times in Europe, but he is also aware that the European
parliament and Europe's trade unions have to be kept sweet.
He will thus certainly make some proposals for further legislation when he
unveils his own social action programme in March. These are likely to
include measures requiring employers to train, and further measures on sex
equality and working time.
But that will constitute a tame list compared with the one drawn up in 1989
by Ms Vasso Papandreou, the more activist Greek social affairs commissioner.
It was that long list - including directives on controlling working time,
European works councils, and young workers - which led to constant battles
between Britain and Brussels, and then to Britain's right to 'opt-out' from
some employment legislation agreed in the Maastricht treaty in 1991.
Over the next few months Mr Flynn still needs to clear up the loose ends of
that 1989 programme, in particular the 'posted workers' directive and a
directive on part-time work.
Both of these, which are still in draft form until voted into EU law by
ministers, have aroused controversy in several member states (which is why
they have not been tackled earlier) but they also have strong support,
especially from France and Germany.
Under the posted workers directive, companies sending employees to work in
other EU states would have to observe the terms and conditions operating in
those states. Countries such as Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Britain, which
have large numbers of their citizens working abroad, have resisted the
directive. There is also disagreement between member states about whether it
should be subject to majority or unanimous voting when it is discussed by
employment ministers on December 6.
However, France is backing the draft directive strongly partly because it
has just passed domestic legislation requiring foreign employers to pay
French wage rates and wants to avoid legal proceedings against it on
competition grounds.
The Bonn government, which currently holds the EU presidency, also backs the
directive, although it is ready to restrict it to the construction sector
which is where Germany has been most affected because of its
unification-driven construction boom.
On the part-timers draft directive, which requires part-timer workers to
receive the same hourly pay and conditions as full-timers, Bonn is keen to
press the issue because it fits with its domestic agenda of promoting
part-time work.
The British government has the power to block this particular directive
because it is subject to unanimous voting, and barring a big surprise it
will use that power. That means the issue is likely to become the second
issue to trigger the British 'opt-out'. It will probably be passed in all
other member states next year.
The part-timers directive will be only the second directive to exclude
Britain - following the directive on European works councils earlier this
year - and will thus cement a 'multi-speed Europe' at least in the
employment field. Although Brussels is in theory opposed to this approach in
the employment field, and wants to draw Britain back into the fold, it may
become a model for other parts of the EU as it expands.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Frankfurt bank shut because of bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German finance market watchdogs yesterday shut down a Frankfurt bank which
had been crippled by bad loans to clients allegedly introduced to it by Mr
Tevfik Ozal, son of Turkey's late president, Mr Turgut Ozal.
The Deutsch-Schweizerische Bank, which recently passed into the control of
Mr Sergio Cuoghi, an Italian investor, had its licence withdrawn and about
DM100m (Pounds 41m) in customer deposits frozen.
The action was taken, said the banking supervisory office, because
'considerable additional valuation adjustments and write-offs' were needed
in its credit business.
According to the latest available figures, DSB, a small, unprofitable
operation, had a balance sheet total of DM233.8m at the end of 1992, down
from DM400m two years earlier.
A statement from the bank yesterday said it had been left with no basis for
continuing in business after Mr Cuoghi failed - despite 'several reminders'
 -to inject new capital and credit guarantees due in mid-September.
Mr Cuoghi, who was described in the statement as the 'extremely rich' head
of the EhroFin financial group with offices in Geneva, London and New York,
recently bought 75 per cent of DSB from Mr Ozal and the Alem Bank of
Kazakhstan for an undisclosed sum. The remaining 25 per cent is held by the
Zug-based Swiss Cantobank.
Mr Ozal resigned his management board seat two weeks ago after Mr Cuoghi
took control, according to Mr Volkmar von Alten, a DSB director.
Mr von Alten, a member of the bank's management board since last February,
said bad loans to three Turkish banks which were the cause of DSB's problems
had been on the books when he arrived. The banks, introduced by Mr Ozal, had
since been ordered to close by the Ankara government.
'I am not responsible. It is very difficult to judge what has happened,' he
said, adding that he would offer to resign once the affair was cleared up.
The scale of the bad loans was 'not outrageous, but enough'.
Mr von Alten, formerly a senior manager at Dresdner Bank, said he was
certain Mr Cuoghi would meet his commitments, including the injection of
additional capital, possibly by as early as this week.
As for the future of DSB, he said that Mr Cuoghi, rather than applying for a
new licence to operate the business as a bank, intended to run it in future
as a 'finance and investment house'. 'I think Mr Cuoghi is a good
businessman and is determined to stick to his commitments,' he said.
Mr Cuoghi was at his offices in Chelsea, London, yesterday, but could not be
contacted for comment.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Benn publishes details of MPs' cash probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Commons investigation into the so-called 'cash-for-questions'
affair broke up in disarray last night after the veteran Labour MP Mr Tony
Benn defied parliamentary rules and published details of the inquiry's
private deliberations.
The clash on the powerful privileges committee came as Mr Peter Preston,
editor of The Guardian, faced an investigation by MPs into his newspaper's
use of a doctored Commons letterhead during its inquiries into the payment
of a Cabinet minister's hotel bill.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday cleared the way for an
emergency Commons debate today, which is expected to lead to a decision that
the newspaper should be the subject of a privileges committee probe.
Her decision followed a direct attack on the Guardian editor by Mr John
Major, the prime minister. He told the Commons: 'If it is commonly accepted
in journalism that the end justifies any means, then I believe journalism
will regret stooping to that particular standard.'
Mr Preston, already facing a barrage of criticism from Tory MPs, last night
announced he had resigned from the Press Complaints Commission, the
self-regulatory organisation which adjudicates on complaints against
newspapers.
Mr Preston said he had decided 'the cleanest thing' he could do was to 'make
the break' with the commission. He stressed in his letter to Lord McGregor,
the commission's chairman, that his resignation was not an admission that
his conduct deliberately flouted the code of practice. 'I do not believe it
did and did not believe it last November when the events so copiously
described took place,' he said.
Hopes of a cross-party agreement at Westminster on the way in which the
Commons should investigate charges against individual MPs suffered a severe
setback when Mr Benn stuck to his insistence that the proceedings should be
published.
A statement released after the two-hour meeting of the privileges committee,
which was due to investigate charges against two Tory MPs alleged to have
accepted payment for tabling questions, said it could not interview
witnesses without giving them 'the opportunity to consider . . . the
position created by Mr Benn's statement'.
Mr Benn, a former cabinet minister, published the committee's private
deliberations last night as 'my own reports of its proceedings'.
His six-page account of the meeting shows that the Conservative members
argued strongly against interviewing the two MPs facing investigation - Mr
Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - as long as he insisted on
publication.
Mr Benn now faces the threat of a Commons motion to order his expulsion from
the privileges committee, a move unprecedented in recent times. The
committee itself is not expected to meet again until after the opening of
the new session of parliament on November 16.
The meeting was attended by the committee's seven Labour members, who have
been boycotting its deliberations over the government's insistence that
hearings be held in private.
Meanwhile Sir Paul Beresford, the housing minister who is the latest target
of press allegations, denied any wrongdoing over combining government duties
with part-time work as a dentist.
Solicitors acting for Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, yesterday wrote to
Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, to call for an
urgent decision on whether he would face criminal charges for his alleged
attempts to 'blackmail' the government.
Today's debate is expected to be on a motion calling for The Guardian to be
investigated by the privileges committee.
Announcing the debate to MPs yesterday, Miss Boothroyd said the 'essential'
issue was: 'The alleged action of The Guardian newspaper in representing
that a letter sent by it to the Ritz hotel in Paris was sent in the name of
a member of this house.'

FT  02 NOV 94 / WHO pours cold water on spirit of safe drinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no such thing as safe drinking, the World Health Organisation
declared yesterday. It launched a strong attack on 'a campaign which for
some time has been trying to give the impression that moderate alcohol
consumption could be good for health'.
According to Mr Hans Emblad, the Swedish director of WHO's substance abuse
programme, there is 'no minimum threshold below which alcohol can be
consumed without any risk'. The message should be 'the less you drink, the
better'.
The warning provoked a furious counter-attack from alcohol researchers.
'WHO's statement is out of date and has not taken account of many recent
findings,' said Sir Richard Doll, honorary consultant at the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund unit in Oxford. He was principal author of a study published
last month showing that a couple of drinks a day do more good than harm for
middle-aged and elderly men.
'This is the usual set of knee-jerk opinions from the WHO - and
scientifically they are wrong,' said Mr John Duffy, director of statistics
at Edinburgh University's Alcohol Research Unit.
The WHO listed a catalogue of woes associated with alcohol - cancers and
chronic liver diseases, dependence, accidents, risky sex, suicides, family
problems, violence and crime. The reduction in risk of heart disease, it
said, relates to very low consumption levels - of the order of one drink
every other day - and applies only to men over 35 and post-menopausal women.
Mr Duffy, on the other hand, said yesterday that men drinking 20 to 30 units
(a glass of wine equals one unit) a week had the lowest mortality rates in
Britain.
Mr Emblad said studies showing that low alcohol consumption helped prevent
heart disease were being misused for 'commercial purposes' to promote the
idea that drinking in moderation is good for health.
Mr Duffy said in the real world there were political interests keen to
promote the idea that all drinking is bad - notably the state alcohol
monopolies in Nordic countries wanting to use the health argument to protect
their markets against cheap imports.

The dollar set a post-war opening low in Tokyo early today of Y96.51 despite
reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan. Earlier it had lost ground in
New York as stock and bond markets fell sharply after a report showing
stronger-than-expected price pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
dropped 44.75 points to close at 3,863.37 and the 30-year Treasury bond fell
almost a point. Page 4;

FT  02 NOV 94 / Bank hints at need for rate rise: Inflation forecast for
mid-1996 falls to 2.5% but concern mounts over price pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rates will probably need to rise over the coming months to keep
inflation on target, the Bank of England implied in its quarterly inflation
report yesterday.
The Bank said the inflation outlook had improved since its last report. Its
central forecast of underlying inflation (which excludes mortgage interest
payments) in mid-1996 has been reduced to 2.5 per cent, from around 3 per
cent in its last forecast.
The report will set the agenda for today's monthly monetary meeting between
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, which will discuss interest rate policy. The two agreed to
an increase in base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent after their September 7
meeting.
Financial markets appeared to be buoyed yesterday by the view that the
report made an imminent rise in rates less likely. The Institute of
Directors said it saw no evidence of overheating in the economy to justify a
further increase in rates.
The government has a target range for inflation of 1-4 per cent, but the
former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, added the aim of reaching the lower
half of the government's target range by the end of this parliament. The
Bank now regards the lower half of the band as its effective target.
While the Bank's forecast inflation just within the lower half of the range,
it warns that its central projection 'is only the single most likely
outcome. The risk of inflation being higher than the central projection is
greater than the probability of it being lower'. The Bank is particularly
concerned about the recent pick-up in producer price inflation, which has
been fuelled by increases in raw materials prices. 'It is not clear how far
price pressures will be passed down the production and retail chain,' the
report said. Higher producer prices might eventually feed through into
higher retail prices.
The Bank also said that the rapid growth of M0, the narrow measure of the
money supply, was 'cause for concern' and said that wage rises might
increase faster than currently expected.
Given the balance of the risks, and the lags involved between changes in
interest rates and their effects on the economy, it is likely that an
increase in rates will be needed during the next few months to keep
inflation within the 1-2.5 per cent band.
Nevertheless, financial markets felt that the reduction in the Bank's
inflation forecast meant that the eventual rise in interest rates might be
smaller than expected. Gilts rose sharply after the report was issued, to
end the day about half a point higher.
About half of the downward revision in the Bank's inflation forecast was due
to the recent rise in interest rates, which will slow the growth of demand,
especially in view of the high levels of debt in the personal sector.
The rest of the revision was due to a combination of the recent falls in
inflation, and lower-than-expected wage rises.

FT  02 NOV 94 / Heseltine tables revised plan for Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, last night tabled a
complicated plan for partial privatisation of the Post Office.
His last-ditch attempt to rescue the government's privatisation would
involve a 40 per cent sell-off of the Royal Mail and the transfer of another
20 per cent to an independent trust.
The remaining 40 per cent would be held in the public sector for a minimum
of two parliaments and would include a 'golden share', guaranteeing the
government the final say in controversial strategic decisions.
The independent trust would comprise representatives of employees at all
levels of the Royal Mail and, crucially, members of the Federation of
Sub-Postmasters representing owners of rural post offices.
With senior ministers preparing for a critical meeting later today on
whether to scrap the sell-off, Mr Heseltine told Tory opponents of
privatisation that the new scheme would guarantee the future of rural Post
Offices.
But the outcome of his eleventh-hour manoeuvring remained uncertain last
night, with some Tory MPs insisting they would have to study the proposals
before deciding whether to drop their opposition.
Today's meeting of the cabinet's industry committee will consider also the
government's original plan to dispose of a 51 per cent stake in the Royal
Mail and the possibility of giving it greater commercial freedom.
In individual meetings with the backbench Tory MPs who have threatened to
wreck any sale, Mr Heseltine made it clear that his own preference remained
a straight flotation of 51 per cent.
But the new scheme had been devised to meet the concern of Tory backbenchers
that transfer of a majority stake to the private sector would undermine the
national coverage and the viability of rural Post Offices.
The plan will also meet the insistence of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
that unless the government's stake is below 50 per cent, the Royal Mail
cannot be granted commercial freedom. With 40 per cent of the equity in the
private sector and 20 per cent held by the trust, management of the Royal
Mail would be free to make investment decisions.
Mr Heseltine told the rebels that unless the privatisation plan was included
in the Queen's Speech on November 16, the project would have to be dropped
until after the next election.

FT  02 NOV 94 / MPs to consider investigation of Guardian editor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, faces an investigation by MPs into
the newspaper's use of a doctored Commons letterhead during its inquiries
into the payment of a Cabinet minister's hotel bill.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday cleared the way for an
emergency Commons debate today, which is expected to lead to a vote on
whether the newspaper should be the subject of a privileges committee probe.
Her decision came after prime minister's questions, when former Tory
ministers led a sustained assault on Mr Preston and the activities of
investigative journalists.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said: 'If it is commonly accepted in
journalism that the end justifies any means, then I believe journalism will
regret stooping to that particular standard.'
Meanwhile, Labour MPs on the privileges committee rejoined the body for a
private session to try to break the procedural deadlock over its
'cash-for-questions' inquiry. The seven had boycotted the hearings over the
government's insistence that they be held in private.
The committee broke up without resolving whether its inquiry would be
conducted entirely in private.
Sir Paul Beresford, the housing minister who is the latest target of press
allegations, strongly denied any wrongdoing over combining government duties
with part-time work as a dentist.
Yesterday's developments at Westminster came as solicitors acting for Mr
Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, wrote to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of
public prosecutions, to call for an urgent decision on whether he would face
criminal charges for his alleged attempts to 'blackmail' the government.
Mr Major told MPs last week that an unnamed intermediary had made
allegations against several ministers and requested a meeting between the
prime minister and Mr Fayed to discuss the DTI report into his takeover of
House of Fraser, Harrods' parent company.
Today's debate is expected to be on a motion calling for The Guardian's
actions to be investigated by the privileges committee.
Announcing the debate to MPs yesterday, Miss Boothroyd said the 'essential'
issue to be covered was: 'The alleged action of The Guardian newspaper in
representing that a letter sent by it to the Ritz hotel in Paris was sent in
the name of a member of this house.'
The newspaper has admitted using a doctored Commons letterhead to seek
details of a minister's bill incurred at the hotel, which is owned by Mr
Fayed.
Miss Boothroyd's decision followed an investigation by Sir Alan Urwick,
Serjeant at Arms, ordered by her on Monday.
Mr Major said MPs had a right to expect the highest standards from the press
just as it demanded the highest standards from parliament.

experimental drug
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Biogen, the genetic-engineering concern, yesterday said it was stopping
development of one of its two most promising experimental drugs. The
decision represents a big blow to the company's efforts to become a fully
integrated drug manufacturer.
The company said it had decided it would no longer pursue efforts to market
an anticoagulant known as Hirulog, which is made from a chemical produced by
leeches.
Biogen, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it would take a Dollars 25m
pre-tax charge in the third quarter to cover expenses related to the move.
Including the provision, the company posted a net loss of Dollars 26.4m, or
80 cents a share, for the three months to the end of September.
In the corresponding period of 1993, it earned Dollars 11.3m, or 33 cents,
on revenues of Dollars 37.3m. Sales in the most recent quarter were down
nearly 15 per cent at Dollars 31.8m.
Shares in Biogen closed up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: UBS 'unlikely' to match last
year's record income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, which is in the midst of a proxy battle with its
largest shareholder over its business strategy, has said its 1994 net income
will be lower than the record SFr2.27bn (Dollars 1.8bn) it made last year.
'Last year's excellent result is unlikely to be reached,' UBS, Switzerland's
largest bank, said in a statement on third-quarter trading. Earlier, it had
left open the possibility of matching the 1993 result.
The bank blamed unfavourable market conditions for a decline in
third-quarter profits.
No figures were given, but it said both net interest income and trading
income were down, although the trading result was 'substantially higher'
than in the previous quarter.
Fee and commission income were said to be 'excellent', marking the only
contrast with the third-quarter report of Credit Suisse which said last week
its commissions business suffered a 'slight downturn'.
UBS said commissions from its corporate finance business were
unsatisfactory.
Expenses were down noticeably. As in the case of Credit Suisse, bad loan
provisions were reduced but remained at a high level.

FT  01 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) Lautro raps life company's pension deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 3rd November 1994) appended to this article.
Small employers who bought off-the-peg occupation pension schemes from Crown
Life sales agents following poor investment advice may be eligible for
compensation, says Lautro, the self-regulating body for the insurance
industry.
According to the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service more than 4,700 of
about 5,500 group occupational schemes sold by Crown Life have been wound
up.
The advisory service said that in many cases independent trustees to the
schemes are finding it impossible to reconcile pension assets with scheme
members because record-keeping was so poor.
Lautro, whose work is being taken over by the Personal Investment Authority,
said yesterday that in inspection visits to Century Life, which acquired the
pensions business from Crown Life in January last year, it found
'significant breaches of Lautro rules covering compliance procedures and the
quality of investment advice'.
Mr Don Hall, chief executive of the advisory service, said Crown Life sales
agents sold group 'defined benefit' schemes to small employers for whom they
were probably inappropriate. Complaints from members of Crown Life schemes
accounted for a disproportionate number of the complaints received about
schemes administered by insurance companies.
Lautro said its monitoring committee outlined the requirement for a
comprehensive review of the business and 'appropriate corrective measures in
relation to management of the sales operation and the compensation of
investors where appropriate'.
It had decided that a full hearing before its disciplinary committee was
unwarranted because Century had taken steps to place the business of Crown
on a proper regulatory basis.
Lautro said Century 'had good reason to believe that an acceptable state of
compliance existed' in Crown's business.
CORRECTION
The criticisms by Lautro reported in Tuesday's Financial Times under the
heading 'Lautro raps life company's pension deals' related to CCL Assurance,
not to Crown Life as inaccurately stated in the report. Century Life has
acquired the pensions business both of CCL Assurance and of Crown Life and
there has been no criticism by Lautro of Crown Life.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME ready for US warehouses to
stock copper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange seems certain to plug a big gap in its
international coverage early next year by allowing its warehouses in the US
to stock copper.
The US is the biggest consumer of copper in the world but it is also the
second-largest producer. When the LME's first authorised warehouse was
opened there in 1992 copper was excluded because, it was said, the LME did
not feel the time was right to challenge the New York Commodity Exchange's
copper contract.
There was another reason: copper at that time was traded in the LME 'ring'
in sterling while Comex copper was traded in dollars and this gave
occasional arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However, subsequent
turbulence in the currency markets caused a change of heart among most
London-based traders, so the copper contract was switched to dollars in July
last year.
It was obvious then that it would not be very long before the LME put copper
into its US warehouses, particularly as its present chairman, Mr Raj Bagri,
was determined to enhance the exchange's international status. 'There can be
no no-go areas,' he insisted.
Mr Bagri said yesterday at a ceremony to mark the LME's move to new premises
in Leadenhall Street, in London's financial district, that the question of
expanding the warehousing network was 'at the top of the LME's agenda.'
He would not say more but traders suggested last night that the topic might
be raised at this month's board meeting after which there would have to be a
90 day 'consulting' period before the move to put copper into the US could
be confirmed.
The LME has spent Pounds 5m to refit its new premises, on which it has a
30-year lease, to produce a trading floor and auxiliary activities to suit
its needs exactly. The traditional seats in the 'ring' have been
incorporated along with modern communications booths and small offices for
members in an area twice as big as the LME's previous home in Plantation
House, Fenchurch Street, a short walk away.
However, Mr David King, the chief executive, insisted that the LME had no
present intention of changing its trading practices. For example, there were
no plans to switch to all-day trading from the present methods - an
inter-office telephone market and two open-outcry floor sessions. This is
little different from the system the exchange used 100 years ago.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: GDR issues in India about to
enter new phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian government's announcement over the weekend that it is changing
the rules for companies making international equity offers may mean the
market for global depositary receipts issued by Indian companies is about to
enter a new phase.
The move was prompted by large inflows of foreign capital - about Dollars
2.1bn of Indian global depositary receipts (GDRs) have been issued so far
this year - and the Indian government has acted on two fronts.
First, it has said companies no longer need to use capital within 12 months
of raising it. However, to slow the flow of funds into India, proceeds must
now be kept abroad until they are needed.
Second, the government has banned the use of warrants, which give investors
the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future. Issuing warrants was
sometimes used to make offers more attractive, since they could be priced
more cheaply than existing shares. 'You tended to use warrants when you
needed to get the issue away,' said one banker involved with GDRs.
Ending the use of warrants is likely to mean a two-tier market emerging for
GDRs, some bankers believe. First-division companies will be able to raise
capital successfully with GDRs but second division companies may struggle.
Blue-chip companies like Bajaj Auto, the highly-successful Indian scooter
maker, will always have a following among investors. However, GDRs issued by
second-tier companies may join the 85 per cent of Indian GDRs trading at a
discount to the local shares.
'There is a flight to quality and liquidity,' said one banker.
Ironically, bankers agree that the need for action was prompted by the
success of the Indian government's liberalisation programme, as companies
have moved to take advantage of access to free-market international capital.
'This is a government that is not quite sure if the market should rule or
whether it wants to control the market,' said a banker.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Axa to invest Dollars 10m in
Turkish investment fund venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, is planning to start
operations in Turkey next year as part of its policy of international
expansion.
The group, which bucked the trend in the French insurance sector by recently
reporting half-year net group profits up 26 per cent to FFr1.5bn (Dollars
290m), plans to invest Dollars 10m in a joint venture with Oyak, the Turkish
investment fund to begin in April next year.
The investment is one of several designed to broaden the group's
international basis, said Mr Claude Tondil, director in charge of
international development.
The company is also set to launch a direct marketing company to sell
insurance in Germany. 'Germany is a more difficult market to penetrate than
Japan,' said Mr Tondil, referring to the group's recently-boosted operations
in Asia Pacific.
While other French insurance companies are holding back from additional
international investment, Mr Tondil said Axa was looking for new
acquisitions in Europe, Asia and North America.
He said about 60 per cent of Axa's premium income was generated in France.
Mr Tondil said he was also looking in the UK for additional property and
casualty interests, but British insurers were too over-valued.
In North America, he said Axa was interested in expanding only cautiously,
avoiding the natural-disaster prone regions, such as Florida and California.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: UBS 'unlikely' to match last
year's record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland, which is in the midst of a proxy battle with its
largest shareholder over its business strategy, has said its 1994 net income
will be lower than the record SFr2.27bn (Dollars 1.8bn) it made last year.
'Last year's excellent result is unlikely to be reached,' UBS, Switzerland's
largest bank, said in a statement on third-quarter trading. Earlier, it had
left open the possibility of matching the 1993 result.
The bank blamed unfavourable market conditions for a decline in
third-quarter profits.
No figures were given, but it said both net interest income and trading
income were down, although the trading result was 'substantially higher'
than in the previous quarter.
Fee and commission income were said to be 'excellent', marking the only
contrast with the third-quarter report of Credit Suisse which said last week
its commissions business suffered a 'slight downturn'.
UBS said commissions from its corporate finance business were
unsatisfactory.
Expenses were down noticeably. As in the case of Credit Suisse, bad loan
provisions were reduced but remained at a high level.
UBS has called an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for November
22 to vote on its proposal to convert all registered shares into bearer
shares. The par value on the registered is one-fifth that on the bearers,
giving an investment in them much more voting power than the same stake in
bearers.
The proposal is opposed by BK Vision, an investment fund which has a large
holding in the registered shares and is seeking to rally a majority of votes
to make substantial board changes at the next annual meeting in April.
Operating profit at Maculan, the Austrian construction group with large
operations in eastern Germany, plunged in the first half by 42 per cent to
Sch81.7m (Dollars 7.69m). It also forecast lower net income in the full
year.
Turnover was up 14 per cent to Sch6.9bn, due to a 19 per cent increase in
Germany, which accounted for just over half of group revenue.
The group said the decline in operating profit was partly due to delays in
Russian housing projects for returning soldiers.
The extra costs in the Russian projects will be borne by the customer but
this will be reflected only in next year's earnings after they are
completed.

<TEXT>
A Kashmiri militant group holding three backpackers hostage has threatened
to behead them if 10 of their own men are not freed from jail, the United
News of India agency said. Earlier, a British Foreign Office spokesman said
three Britons and an American had been captured. He named the three Britons
as Paul Ridout of Dorset, Miles Croston of Buckinghamshire and Rhys
Partridge of Suffolk. But hours after the kidnap claim was received, police
said the American was found near New Delhi chained to an iron post,
unharmed. Bela Joseph Nuss told police he had been kidnapped 10 days before.
Voice of America radio received letters containing the kidnap claim,
accompanied by photographs of the hostages held at gunpoint. The group,
calling itself Al Hadid, said it was based in the tribal areas of
Afghanistan. Officials said they had not previously heard of Al Hadid, but
five of the men whose freedom was sought were from militant groups fighting
in Kashmir.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Meciar agrees to form a cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRATISLAVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The former Slovak prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, formally agreed
yesterday to try to form a coalition government, a full month after the
electoral victory of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Reuter
reports from Bratislava.
Mr Meciar made the announcement in a letter to President Michal Kovac, who
played a key role in his downfall in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last
March.
The letter is the latest twist in Slovakia's personality-dominated politics
since the elections of September 30 and October 1, when the HZDS took 35 per
cent of the vote and 61 seats in the 150-member parliament.
Shortly after the vote, Mr Kovac appointed the HZDS to lead coalition talks,
but pointedly ignored its leader, Mr Meciar, whose suitability as prime
minister he questioned during campaigning. Mr Meciar rarely appeared as
talks dragged on with little success, preferring to send representatives
instead. At one point a senior HZDS member said Mr Kovac should resign for
the sake of Slovak political stability.
However, last Friday the president finally requested that Mr Meciar provide
him with a list of new cabinet members, although he set no deadline.
Mr Kovac's aides said they had received the letter yesterday by express
delivery, but that no HZDS representatives had yet visited the president.
So far the HZDS has clinched support in forming a coalition only from its
traditional ally, the extreme nationalist Slovak National party, which won
nine seats.
Mr Meciar's chances of forming a stable coalition depend largely on whether
he can strike a pact with the four-party grouping, Common Choice, led by
reformed communists of Party of the Democratic Left (SDL).
Talks between the two have so far been inconclusive, leaving Mr Meciar in
limbo and forecasting tough political times ahead.
'To get a majority in parliament we need six more votes. . . to seize the
challenge to solve the crisis situation coming in 1995,' Mr Meciar said in
an interview published yesterday in the daily newspaper, Republika.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cigna withdraws from reinsurance
to help cut losses
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cigna, the US insurer, is withdrawing from the reinsurance business as part
of an attempt to turn round its loss-making property/casualty insurance
operations.
With premiums of Dollars 507m last year, Cigna was among the top 30
reinsurers worldwide.
The company is selling its international reinsurance business, which
generated premiums of Dollars 270m in 1993; transfering its US agricultural
insurance operations, with Dollars 100m of premiums, to its domestic
property/casualty insurer; and closing the rest of the US reinsurance
operations, which had premiums of Dollars 150m.
Its departure from the business echoes moves by other US insurers to reduce
their exposure to property/casualty losses in the wake of big catastrophe
and pollution claims. Prudential Insurance announced plans last year to sell
its own reinsurance company, Prudential Re.
Cigna, which does not publish separate results for its loss-making
reinsurance business, said its overall property/casualty insurance
operations, which include reinsurance, lost Dollars 69m in the third quarter
and Dollars 216m in the nine months to September.
The company closed down its UK reinsurance business two years ago, but
continued to take run-off losses on this business of Dollars 10m last year.
Cigna is selling its reinsurance business in Europe, South East Asia and
Latin America to St Paul, and its business in Japan and Korea to Employers
Re.
The company reported overall third-quarter net income of Dollars 123m, or
Dollars 1.70 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, a year ago.

Goldstrike lifts output
</HEADLINE>

   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, raised third-quarter
earnings by 5 per cent, due largely to higher output at the flagship
Goldstrike property in Nevada, and a contribution from recently-acquired Lac
Minerals.
Barrick's per-share earnings were diluted by the issue of 66m common shares
as part of the Lac purchase price. That deal closed on September 6.
Net earnings climbed to USDollars 61.3m, or 20 cents a share, from Dollars
58.3m, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced to Dollars 216m from
Dollars 178m.
Earnings growth has been dampened by rising exploration expenses, as Barrick
spreads its wings in Latin America and Asia. Exploration spending is
forecast to rise to Dollars 30m next year, more than double 1994 levels.
Lac's properties in North America and Chile contributed about 30,000 ozs to
third-quarter production, which totalled 560,500 ozs, up from 413,800 ozs a
year earlier. Output from Goldstrike's Betze-Post pit rose to 466,500 ozs
from 368,000 ozs.
Barrick forecast 1994 output from its eight mines at more than 2.2m ozs.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Pfizer to pay Dollars 158m for
cardiology group
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pfizer, the US pharmaceuticals group, said it was buying a specialist maker
of hospital cardiology equipment in an all-stock deal valued yesterday at
Dollars 158m.
The purchase will give Pfizer a dominant position in the market for such
equipment, and reflects the consolidation under way in the US healthcare
sector. Faced with pressure from hospitals and other buyers for lower
prices, most healthcare companies have come to focus on market share as
their primary short-term goal.
Namic USA, based in Glen Falls, New York, reported after-tax profits of
Dollars 5m on sales of Dollars 57m in its last fiscal year, which ended on
May 31. It claims around two-thirds of the US market for equipment used in
fluid administration, waste containment and pressure monitoring during
angioplasty.
Namic said it also accounts for about 20 per cent of the European market for
this equipment, and that the acquisition by Pfizer would increase its
ability to expand in European markets.
Pfizer's own subsidiary which makes cardiology equipment, Schneider,
accounted for just under 15 per cent of the Dollars 1bn sales generated by
its hospital supplies operations in 1993. Shares in Pfizer jumped Dollars
3/4 to close at Dollars 74 1/8 yesterday while Namic's shares leapt Dollars
3 3/4 to Dollars 17 3/8 .

FT  01 NOV 94 / Scotland exports reach Pounds 11.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufactured exports from Scotland rose 19 per cent at current prices in the
1993-94 financial year to reach Pounds 11.5bn, accounting for 10.3 per cent
of the UK's manufactured exports.
Exports by Scotland's big electronics sector grew 41.5 per cent while whisky
exports rose 7 per cent.
Growth in sales to North America, the European Free Trade Association and
the Far East far outstripped exports to the European Union, although
Scotland's single biggest export market was France.
The statistics show that Scottish exports have grown faster in the past two
years than in the previous six. The figures are based on a survey carried
out by the Scottish Council Development and Industry.

FT  01 NOV 94 / TVR to boost sports car production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TVR, the Blackpool-based independent sports car maker, is doubling the size
of its manufacturing plant and starting its first night shift to build a
third range of cars and expand production.
The company said last night that it had taken orders worth Pounds 10m for
the Cerbera, a new 2 + 2 coupe model exhibited at last week's UK motor show
which will enter commercial production before the end of the year.
The Pounds 33,000 car will be the first to use an engine of TVR's own design
and manufacture, a 350 horsepower V8.
TVR said the Cerbera would help lift its output to above 1,000 cars this
year for the first time in the company's 40-year history.
The company said: 'The Pounds 10m covers the supply of 276 cars and means
that production next year could well rise to 1,350 to 1,400.'
TVR produced 827 cars last year, and just over 500 in the first seven months
of this year.
Mr Peter Wheeler, the company's chairman and owner for the past decade, has
been cautious about expansion because of the notoriously cyclical nature of
the specialist car market.
However, TVR's image as a sports car maker has been raised sharply since
1990 by the launch of the two-seater models it has in production, the
Griffith and Chimaera. The bigger Cerbera is regarded as providing a
sufficiently broad product range for higher output.
An additional 100 workers - bringing the total to 300 - have been trained in
its manufacturing processes in the past 18 months, with more jobs yet to be
created.
The additional number is not expected to be large, however.
Most of the higher production will come from increased efficiency as the
result of acquiring a big ware-house adjoining the main factory.
TVR said it would double the available area for assembly and eliminate
production bottlenecks.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Japan and US miss glass pact deadline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan and the US have failed to finalise an accord to give US manufacturers
better access to the Japanese market for flat glass.
Negotiators from the two sides met into the early hours of this morning but
could not agree on details of an accord that was agreed in principle a month
ago. They had set yesterday as the deadline for wrapping up the agreement.
'We made real progress, but there are still technical and practical problems
to resolve,' said an official of the Japanese Ministry of International
Trade and Industry. He indicated negotiations would be re-sumed though no
date had yet been set for another round of talks.
Lack of agreement by the deadline could prompt the US into taking unilateral
trade action, possibly sanctions, against Japan's flat glass market.
Negotiations had been going on since last Wednesday. Mr Hideaki Kumano,
vice-minister for international trade and industry, voiced the hope
yesterday that the two sides might still settle the glass talks by the
deadline.
The talks are a remnant of the bilateral framework negotiations in which
Japan and the US reached a partial agreement a month ago.
At that time, the issue of flat glass, as well as Japan's market for
vehicles and vehicle parts, was postponed when Japan and the US announced
they had reached agreement in four of the five sectors targeted in the
negotiations. An accord on the glass market had been reached 'in principle,'
the Japanese government said at the time, leaving only the details to be
worked out within 30 days.
Mr Steve Farrar, director of international business for Guardian Industries,
a US glass maker, said yesterday most differences had been resolved. As with
other US-Japan disputes, stalemate has emerged over US efforts to pin down
specific criteria to measure progress.
'We want to avoid having a situation where importers could buy token amounts
and never become serious customers,' he said. 'We want to be sure that what
is being measured is substantial business relationships.'
The US claims that Japan's flat glass market, which is the second largest in
the world at Dollars 4.5bn a year, is closed to foreign suppliers.
This is because of the dominance of three large domestic producers which
have very tightly controlled distribution arrangements with the industry's
wholesalers.
US makers have only a 1 per cent share of the Japanese market, compared with
more than 25 per cent in Europe and Latin America, the US says. Under these
circumstances, the US would like to see more procurement of US-made glass
for facilities owned by the government in addition to greater market access
in the private sector.
The Japanese side has claimed that its market, with imports amounting to 12
per cent, compares favourably to that in the US, where imports are a meagre
5 per cent and in Europe, where foreign-made flat glass accounts for 17 per
cent of the market.
The Japanese government has been reluctant to interfere in what it considers
a matter for the private sector. The basic stance of the government is that
if US companies want a larger share of the Japanese market they should raise
their competitiveness.

Japan is sending two missions to Pakistan to investigate dumping charges

yarn, a Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said
yesterday. Miti and the Ministry of Finance will send one mission in
November and another in December. Both missions will check the accounts of
Pakistani factories to see whether they are exporting cotton yarn to Japan
at a lower price than that at which it sells domestically, the Miti official
said. Japan plans to make a final decision on the case in February 1995.

Singapore's prime minister yesterday lamented the difficulty of luring
talented people into government jobs. Mr Goh Chok Tong told parliament the
country's government was in danger of slipping into mediocre hands that
could imperil its economic success. 'The task of cobbling together a good
cabinet is getting more difficult as competent people prefer to work in the
private sector for better salaries,' he said, when presenting a plan for big
salary rises for ministers and civil servants. 'Unless we find several
potential ministers soon, we will have a serious succession problem by
2000.'

crime-fighting organ with the military directing united operations of the
state-controlled military and civil police, justice secretariat and civil
defence secretariat. The army will supply the police with the same heavy

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (13): A leader in global TV news -
Aggressive expansion by CNN television network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Along with the movie Gone with the Wind, Martin Luther King and its baseball
team the Braves, Atlanta is probably best known throughout the US as home to
CNN, the all-news cable television network which sprung to national - and
international - prominence several years ago with its coverage of the Gulf
War.
Yet, the benefits CNN bring to the city go beyond the kudos of national
name-recognition. The network, which is part of the giant entertainment
group Turner Broadcasting System owned by Mr Ted Turner, is also a leading
employer in the metropolitan area as well as a considerable tourist
attraction. The CNN Centre in downtown Atlanta is visited daily by many
hundreds, eager to see at first-hand the production of CNN's television
programming.
The network has come a long way from the early 1980s, when it was widely
derided as 'Chicken Noodle News.' The brainchild of Mr Turner, who foresaw a
demand for 24-hour television news long before anyone else, CNN is regarded
as an important news source for a hardcore audience of US viewers, and as
essential viewing in times of national and international crisis by many
more.
However, CNN's ratings have never been that large - it typically attracts
about 400,000 viewers in the US - and recently its ratings have begun to
slide. In the first quarter of this year, CNN's ratings in the US were down
25 per cent on the same period of 1993, and in the first six months of this
year lower ratings contributed to flat advertising revenues. Without
continued growth in CNN International, the network's non-US operation, CNN
would have reported a decline in revenues for the first half of 1993.
Yet, some of the decline in ratings cannot be blamed on CNN itself - like
any news service, it needs big news events to keep viewers tuned in, and
during the first half of 1994 a lack of big news, combined with improving
competition from local newscasts and specialist news magazines, took their
toll. (Although the double-murder story involving sports star OJ Simpson was
huge news in the US, CNN faced stiff competition from local news purveyors
and specialist channels such as Court TV).
The recent weakness in domestic ratings, however, cannot obscure the fact
that CNN remains a handsomely profitable business for its parent TBS. Last
year, it generated an operating profit of Dollars 231m on revenues of almost
Dollars 600m.
Moreover, CNN's ratings have always moved with the news cycle, and the third
quarter of 1994 produced two big stories with a strong US and international
dimension - the crisis in Haiti and the threat of another invasion of Kuwait
by Iraq - could pay off in the form of higher viewership for the second half
of this year.
Furthermore, the maturing of its domestic market need not be so worrying as
long as CNN continues to build revenues from its international operation.
After years of losing money, CNNI is now in profit and the fastest-growing
arm of CNN. Its revenues last year totalled about Dollars 100m, and this
year CCNI is expected to earn between Dollars 50m and Dollars 60m on
revenues of Dollars 113m. That is a considerable improvement from four years
ago, when CNNI lost a little over Dollars 3m on revenues of just Dollars
13.6m.
This growth has come from aggressive expansion into new markets in three
main regions - Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. It has been
accomplished mostly by adding new satellites that carry larger 'footprints'
which enable CNNI's programmes to be broadcast on a more powerful signal to
homes in a much wider geographic area. As a consequence, as of this summer,
CNNI was transmitting to an estimated 80m television households in more than
210 countries via a network of 12 satellites.
To improve CNNI's news programming, CNN has built a new Dollars 11m
production centre in Atlanta to complement its existing European regional
centre in London, and it will soon open a new Asian regional centre in Hong
Kong. Each centre will produce a version of CNNI programming geared toward
its region's viewers.
In South America, CNN has no English-language competition, but faces a
threat from several Spanish-language networks run by Reuters, the Mexican
television group Televisa, and the US network NBC.
CNNI competes indirectly with them through the four half-hour segments of
Spanish-language news it broadcasts every day, but clearly could lose ground
to the native-language news services because the number of fluent
English-speakers in the region is so small.
In Europe, CNNI's largest market, the principal competition comes from Mr
Rupert Murdoch's Sky News channel. Although Sky is very UK-oriented, Mr
Peter Vesey, head of CNNI, admits: 'On some stories with a particular
European interest, they can be very competitive with us in serving their
UK-based audience.'
Another competitor is Euronews, which was set up by a political mandate from
the European Community and broadcasts news in five different languages -
'it's a wonderful technical achievement,' says Mr Vesey, 'but it's not, from
what I hear, a very watchable product.' CNN could also face competition soon
from the BBC, which has talked of moving into the European market on a
subscription basis with a version of World Service TV.
CNN also competes indirectly with the BBC in the Asia-Pacific region, as it
does with Star TV satellite system, which is the largest in Asia and which
may eventually be part of a global sattelite news service alongside Mr
Murdoch's Fox Television in the US and Sky News in Europe. Mr Vesey says of
CNNI's global competition: 'As you can see, the field is kind of crowded.'
In future, however, CNNI may be competing more with native-language
broadcasters, although here the network has tried to hedge its bets through
its occasional Spanish-language broadcasts and a joint venture with German
broadcasters in Germany called n-tv.
Mr Vesey says: 'We will see more regional competition, but I don't think it
will be English-language competition. If I was to spend a ton of money on
bringing you Asia every day, I would probably choose to do it in Chinese, or
maybe Japanese. That is one of the biggest dilemmas we have classically
faced. English is the best language to be in - on a worldwide basis - but
you're really limiting yourself in terms of a mass audience, and there's no
way around that. The way to extend and expand beyond that is to go the n-tv
route in Europe. If you're going to take it into the region and tell people
about things that are most important to them, you've got to make the
decision to do it in their language.'
The CNNI chief, however, is confident that its head start of 15-years
experience in global news production should allow it to stay ahead of the
international field.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (12): Spotlight on the Carter
Centre - Ambitious goals include conflict resolution in the world's trouble
spots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Carter Centre sits atop a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta, and the
objectives of the institution set up by former president Jimmy Carter match
its lofty location.
The centre, backed by millions of dollars in funds from individual donors,
corporations and private foundations, is dedicated to 'fighting disease,
hunger, poverty, conflict and oppression through collaborative initiatives
in the areas of democratisation and development, global health and urban
revitalisation.'
Although it has been pursuing these ambitious goals since 1982 when it was
established alongside the Carter presidential library and museum, its work
did not begin to attract much attention until more recently, when Mr
Carter's high-profile role as a freelance foreign policy trouble-shooter
focused the spotlight on the ex-president and the Carter Centre.
So active has Mr Carter been in tackling political problems around the world
from his base in Atlanta that some foreign policy pundits have dubbed the
Carter Centre the 'State Department of the South.' The nickname, however, is
not likely to be popular at the centre, which goes out of its way to
emphasise that it has no ties with the federal government.
Its non-governmental, non-partisan status, in fact, is the institution's
greatest asset when it comes to meeting its most challenging objective -
conflict resolution.
Its independence from official political and diplomatic structures enables
the centre to become involved in disputes without taking sides, and it
allows the staff and Mr Carter to negotiate with political and military
leaders who may be persona non grata in Washington and other capitals. As Mr
Carter explained to an audience at his Centre last month: 'I deal with the
people the United States considers unsavoury.'
Aside from Mr Carter's role last month in helping to facilitate the peaceful
removal of the military government in Haiti and his efforts earlier in the
year helping to cool tensions between North and South Korea, he and the
Centre have been involved in less-publicised work in strife-torn countries
such as Ethiopia, Liberia and Sudan. Mr Carter also keeps a line open to
Fidel Castro, Cuba's isolated leader.
The centre's international role does not stop at conflict resolution,
however. Its also helps countries hold elections, draft new constitutions
and manage the transition to democracy. Additionally, the centre and its
staff run programmes in the developing world aimed at improving agriculture
and food production, disease prevention and the quality of health care.
While much of this work is conducted away from the public eye, the
diplomatic initiatives, particularly those embarked upon by Mr Carter
personally, have often come under intense scrutiny. The response to these
efforts has not always been favourable. In the past, Mr Carter has been
criticised for interfering with US foreign policy, and sometimes for
undermining or contradicting that policy.
The former president's reknowned ability to see something positive in almost
everyone he meets has also left him vulnerable to attacks that he coddles
dictators and terrorists. As one State Department official put it recently:
'Some tyrant will say, 'I don't have to listen to the American government
representative, because I can always call Atlanta and get a better deal.''
It was recently discovered, for example, that Mr Carter tried in 1991 to
persuade foreign leaders to not back President Bush's coalition to liberate
Kuwait from Iraqi control because he believed he could act as a mediator
between the US and Saddam Hussein.
Although they conform with the Carter Centre's broader mission to 'wage
peace' around the world, some of Mr Carter's forays into foreign policy
situations are not necessarily part of the Centre's official work - much of
which is conducted in less glamorous arenas, both abroad and at home.
On the domestic front, the centre and its staff devote a lot of energy on
improving conditions in the nation's inner cities. The Atlanta Project
(known as TAP) is probably the centre's best known domestic programme.
Launched in October, 1991, TAP helps communities in Atlanta's 20 poorest
neighbourhoods tackle their problems, among them crime, homelessness, drug
abuse, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and poor health. That help involves
providing each of the 20 Atlanta neighbourhood 'clusters' with corporate
sponsors (Coca-Cola, Bell South and Marriott are among the TAP supporters),
recruiting a force of local volunteers to work in the communities, and
enabling the clusters gain access to federal or state funds.
So far, TAP's work has ranged from somewhat vague initiatives such as a
survey of residents's views on how to tackle crime, to more tangible
problem-solving efforts such as a massive child innoculation drive and a
successful campaign to make it easier for Atlanta families to the apply for
public financial assistance.
TAP has its critics, including those who say its impact upon local
communities' problems depends too much on the level of commitment from each
cluster's corporate sponsor, and those who have chided the project's
director for being insensitive to Atlanta's black community ('sensitivity
training' was subsequently arranged for TAP participants). There has also
been some disillusionment over the lack of more noticeable progress in
improving the life of the urban poor. These criticisms, however, have not
prevented the Carter Centre from planning a national version of TAP, called
The America Project.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (11): Catalyst for economic growth
in black areas - Public contracts are vital to the success of minority-owned
businesses, but local competition remains intense / Minority-owned
businesses
</HEADLINE>

Over the past decade, the C D Moody construction company has worked on some
of Atlanta's biggest building projects: Underground Atlanta, a large
shopping mall and tourist attraction in the city centre, the Georgia Dome,
site of the 1994 Super Bowl, and the new atrium at the ever-expanding
Hartsfield International Airport. Not bad for a seven-year-old, black-owned
company with only 47 employees on the payroll.
David Moody, the architect who incorporated the firm in 1988, believes
Atlanta's progressive public policy has helped him to succeed.
'The city of Atlanta's minority participation program was a great help,'
says Mr Moody, whose company will generate Dollars 8m in revenues this year.
'They are serious about it . . . Because of it, I've been able to get my
foot in the door.
Mr Moody's experience supports the argument of many economists that Atlanta
is among the best places for African American entrepreneurs to do business.
But whether or not Atlanta is an oasis of black entrepreneurship depends to
some extent on who one asks. Some Atlantans say the notion of the city as a
'Mecca' for black entrepreneurs is a myth and point to statistics that show
Atlanta lagging behind other metropolitan areas in minority business
success.
According to a recent study by researchers at Clark Atlanta University,
Atlanta barely makes the top-10 list of leading metropolitan areas in terms
of black business growth.
Washington D C, Houston and Sacramento beat the city in terms of black
businesses per 100,000 African Americans. And black-owned companies produce
only 1 per cent of the Atlanta metro area jobs and less than 3.2 per cent of
its business receipts.
Bob Holmes, a state legislator from Atlanta and co-author of the study The
Status of Black Atlanta, says the idea of Atlanta as a benign incubator of
black businesses is 'over hyped' - the product of an effective but
misleading public relations effort on the city's part. Most black-owned
businesses in the city are marginal, he says, and points out that the
African American share of total business receipts has fallen since 1977.
Moreover, Atlanta's black entrepreneurs face the same obstacles as black
entrepreneurs anywhere. Most business growth is in the suburbs, away from
black population centres, and discrimination means black businesses have
more trouble securing loans and doing business within the private sector.
According to the study, discrimination against black-owned businesses comes
in many forms, showing up in 'bonding, price differential . . . refusal to
use (minority) subcontractors, bid manipulation . . . double standards in
performance and qualification . . . slow payment and non-payment' and
'exclusion from the 'Good Old Boy Network' in subcontracting.'
The report acknowledges, however, that great gains have been made in opening
up the public sector to minority-owned businesses, and many black firms are
thriving in the rich Atlanta market.
Mr Moody's ability to build his business on lucrative government contracts
is evidence of this, as is a study by Georgia Tech economist Thomas Boston
now under way. Mr Boston argues that Atlanta, while not a Mecca, is a
thriving centre of black industry and commerce.
'There is probably not another metro area in the country with as many
programs for minority entrepreneurs,' says Mr Boston, who cites contracting
policies that require a minimum percentage of government business to be set
aside for minorities.
Set-asides are mandatory for the city of Atlanta and Fulton County (in which
the city is located), the Atlanta transit authority, and the Atlanta school
board. Voluntary programs are in place at the Atlanta hospital authority and
in neighbouring DeKalb County.
But black contractors still find it hard to break into the private sector.
According to the Clark Atlanta study, Atlanta's minority contractors get 93
per cent of their revenues from the public sector and only 7 per cent from
private markets. In contrast, white contractors generate 80 per cent of
their sales from the private sector.
Mr Boston maintains that public contracts are a vital engine for growth
among minority-owned businesses. 'These programmes allow market penetration
by minorities . . .in areas that were heretofore closed to them,' he says.
This, he adds, enables minority businesses to build strong revenue bases
from which to launch ventures into the private sector.
Meanwhile, Mr Boston argues, the atmosphere for black business in Atlanta is
far better than the Clark Atlanta study suggests. First, he says, according
to his own research, arbitrary census criteria for black-owned businesses
have left nearly three black-owned firms not counted as such for every one
that is recorded. Thus, he says, 'the capacity of black-owned firms is
greater than is commonly perceived.'
In terms of average revenue, the rate of revenue growth and the start-up
rate, Atlanta ranks first among leading metropolitan areas.
Most agree that there is a trend toward greater business growth in the
suburbs at the expense of the city centre, where Atlanta's black population
is largely concentrated. That business growth includes high-revenue
black-owned businesses, the presence of which in the suburbs parallels a
movement by more-affluent blacks away from the city centre. But regardless
of where they are located, black-owned businesses are a catalyst for
economic growth in the black community, no matter how dispersed that
community is becoming.
'Black-owned businesses on average have 85 per cent black employees,' Mr
Boston says. Atlanta's black entrepreneurs, like minority business people
across the country, face significant problems in the area of financing and
credit, he adds. The amount of start-up and improvement capital available to
black businesses is limited, according to the Atlanta Economic Development
Commission.
In this sense, the city is a victim of its own success: the sheer number of
businesses competing for loans often makes it difficult to secure financing.
That, according to Mr Moody, should not be a deterrent to ambitious black
entrepreneurs. If he had to start all over again in business, he says, he
would do it in Atlanta.
'Construction is a tough business, and minority contractors have to prove
themselves constantly. But as far as the public market is concerned, we're
on an equal playing field now.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (9): The home of Coca-Cola - Soft
drinks company is at the forefront of Atlanta community projects - It all
began in Atlanta / A look at the remarkable story behind the world's
best-known trade mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Coca-Cola may not be the biggest company in Atlanta: in terms of sheer
head-count, Delta, AT&amp;T, BellSouth and Lockheed employ more people. But it
is the company most commonly associated with the city, and without doubt the
one with the strongest historical links to it.
Indeed, the company's best-selling product, the Coca-Cola soft drink, was
born in Atlanta more than a century ago. According to legend, the first
Coca-Cola syrup was brewed up in the city on May 8, 1886 by Dr John
Pemberton, a local pharmacist, in a three-legged brass pot in his backyard.
Dr Smith carried a jug of the product down the road to Jacobs' Pharmacy
where it was tasted, pronounced good, and placed on sale as a soda fountain
drink at 5 cents a glass.
Coke has come on a bit since then: today, it is the world's most ubiquitous
consumer product, the world's best-known trade mark and by far the world's
best-selling soft drink. If you include the company's other products -
notably, Fanta and Sprite - Coca-Cola accounts for nearly half the world's
annual consumption of soft drinks.
How did Coca-Cola do it? It helped that people liked the drink (ingredients
of the early version included coca leaves and cola nuts, producing an
exhilarating cocktail of cocaine and caffeine). But there was more to it
than that.
Much of the company's early growth was attributable to the business acumen
of Asa Candler, an Atlantan who bought the business from Dr Pemberton and
greatly expanded it through innovative advertising. Then, in 1919, the
Candler family interests sold the company to a syndicate led by Ernest
Woodruff, another Atlantan, for Dollars 25m - at the time, the biggest
financial transaction the south had seen.
Before long, however, the company was in trouble. There were legal disputes
with bottlers, sugar prices were turbulent, imitators were rampant and sales
were down. There was even talk that the company could go under. But in 1923,
Ernest's son, Robert Woodruff, was elected president. This highly successful
businessman was to lead the company for the next six decades. One of Robert
Woodruff's most astute moves was to embark on a big international expansion
for Coca-Cola. To a large degree, the foundations for this expansion were
laid during the Second World War when Woodruff declared it his objective 'to
see that every man in uniform gets a bottle of Coca-Cola for 5 cents
wherever he is and whatever it costs the company.'
The result was that 64 bottling plants were shipped abroad and billions of
bottles of Coke were consumed.
The reason this proved so important was that the presence of Coca-Cola did
more than lift the morale of the troops. In many areas, it gave people their
first taste of Coca-Cola - a taste they obviously enjoyed. And when peace
returned, the Coca-Cola system was poised for the rapid international growth
that continues today.
This explains one of the big differences between Coca-Cola and its rival
PepsiCo, the US manufacturer of Pepsi-Cola. In the US, Coke struggles to
outsell Pepsi. But in the rest of the world, the only big markets which
Pepsi has been able to dominate are those from which Coke was at one time
excluded for political reasons, such as the former Soviet Union and the
Middle East.
The result is that Coke now gets about 80 per cent of its operating profits
from outside the US, while the figure for PepsiCo's beverage division is
barely 16 per cent.
Although Coca-Cola is easily the world's biggest soft drinks company, and
growing bigger by the day, it cannot afford to relax. Recently, competition
from private label colas has been an irritant in the US, Canada and the UK,
and in the US Coca-Cola is having to react to the rapid growth of
alternative beverages such as iced teas and fruit juice drinks, introducing
its own range of 'natural' drinks. But the company's strong profits growth
suggests it is doing the right things: last year, net income rose by 19 per
cent to a record Dollars 2.2bn, excluding unusual items.
For Atlanta, it is just as well. Apart from the fact that Coca-Cola and its
bottling affiliates provide employment for nearly 8,000 people in the city,
the company has a reputation for being Atlanta's leading corporate citizen,
pursuing a long-standing strategy of philanthropic involvement in the
community.
This philanthropic involvement began with Robert Woodruff, whose
contributions to Atlanta's arts, to cultural organisations and to
educational communities amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars over his
lifetime.
The tradition has been continued by the company itself - not least through
the creation in 1984 of the Coca-Cola Foundation, an organisation dedicated
to supporting excellence in education.
Examples of the foundation's work in Atlanta over the last year or so
include a Dollars 2m contribution to Clark Atlanta University to support
teacher eduction and to develop a School of Public and International
Affairs; a contribution of Dollars 1m to Morris Brown College to support
faculty chair endowments and the Presidential Scolars Program for
African-American students; and a Dollars 1m gift to Georgia State University
for the renovation of the Rialto Theatre and two nearby buildings to help
revive the historic Fairlie-Poplar district.
In the arts field, Coca-Cola makes contributions totalling more than Dollars
1m a year to about 40 organisations. It recently pledged Dollars 500,000 to
the Martin Luther King Jr Center which aims to advance the non-violent
philosophies fo Dr King in the ares of training, research and education. And
it made a Dollars 1m commitment to the Atlanta Project, an initiative
established by the former president Jimmy Carter to fight poverty and
hopelessness in the inner city.
Atlanta's business leaders are unstinting in their praise of Coca-Cola's
contribution to the city - 'if every company were as community-minded as
Coca-Cola, we would have a Utopian city here,' says Mr Gerald Bartels,
president of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. 'They are always in the
forefront of any community project with their money, with their leadership,
with whatever it might take.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (10): Largest of the Baby Bells -
Decade of growth for Atlanta-based BellSouth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) was broken up in 1984 and its
local phone companies divided into regional operating companies, the
Atlanta-based BellSouth was the largest, and fastest-growing, of the seven
'Baby Bells.'
Today, with annual revenues of more than Dollars 16bn and assets of Dollars
40bn, it remains the largest and fastest-growing Baby Bell, an indication
that BellSouth has not wasted the opportunity during its first decade to
build on the strengths evident at the company's birth.
Chief among those strengths was the potential of its local market. BellSouth
has had the good fortune to serve nine states based in the country's
fastest-growing region, the southeast. While much of the rest of the US
endured a recession in 1990-1991, and a subsequent slow and uneven recovery,
the southeast sailed through the stormy waters of the period relatively
unscathed and today continues to lead the nation in the pace of its economic
expansion.
Buoyed by an influx of both residential and business customers moving into
the region from other parts of the US, growth in Bell South's access lines -
the typical measure of a phone company's growth - has been the best in the
industry. The company added 665,000 access lines in 1993, a rate it expects
to top this year.
'The population migration into the southeast has been pretty steady for last
couple of decades, and we get a direct benefit from that because people want
communications,' says Mr John Clendenin, chairman and chief executive of
BellSouth since its inception.
The company has spent a lot of money over the years on its phone system in
the region, an investment in technology which Mr Clendenin regards as
crucial if BellSouth is going to maintain its growth rate.
Between 1988 and the end of 1993, the company spent a total of Dollars 18bn
on modernising its phone system. This year, another Dollars 3bn is scheduled
to be spent on upgrading the system's technology.
Heavy expenditure on technology is just one element of a three-part strategy
BellSouth is pursuing - the others involve an aggressive move into the
wireless cellular phone, paging and mobile data businesses (especially
overseas, where the company is now the world's largest cellular operator),
and a more cautious foray into the cable television market, where the
company hopes to benefit from the much talked-about convergence of the
telecommunications, computer and entertainment industries.
Of BellSouth's careful entry into the cable television business, Mr
Clendenin says: 'We're a very active participant in the explorations going
on. All of the Baby Bells are getting their feet wet in this. We have not
gone into cable overseas the way some have, but we are trying to learn the
same lessons.'
Its first lesson will come from a planned deployment of video technology to
12,000 homes in the Atlanta suburbs. BellSouth's chairman describes the
experiment - which the company hopes will be approved by federal regulators
later this year - as 'a fully interactive, fibre-optic system carrying
communications and video programming into the home.'
Prime Management, the 24th largest cable operator in the US which has been
22.5 per cent-owned by BellSouth since last year, is a key partner in the
Atlanta test operation, which Mr Clendenin hopes will reveal the
technology's potential - 'we'll learn a lot about what the customer wants,
what they'll pay for, how they'll use it: it will become a platform for
wider deployment.'
The partnership with Prime is typical of the BellSouth policy of seeking
partners whenever it explores new markets. This strategy is readily apparent
in many of the company's wireless businesses - such as its co-operative
ventures with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson GE to market mobile
computing and cellular-paging products - but it is probably nowhere more
evident than in its fast-growing overseas businesses.
Outside the US, BellSouth has concentrated its energies in developing a
significant presence in an eclectic mix of national cellular markets. While
the company will be the fourth largest cellular operator in the US when the
Bell Atlantic-Nynex union is completed, it is the largest global cellular
operator based in the US.
BellSouth has been pursuing its aggressive international strategy since the
mid- to late-1980s, starting in Latin America and later France, Germany and
other parts of Europe. The company is also moving into the near east
(Israel), and the Far East - most notably China - and has long had a
sizeable stake in Australia and New Zealand. In most instances, BellSouth
shies away from wired telecommunications systems because it believes the
cellular business offers a much more secure foothold in foreign markets. As
Mr Clendenin says: 'Cellular in many of these countries has been a godsend.
The telephone system in Caracas (Venezual) was so bad that you couldn't get
a call through even if you were the president. Cellular came in and bypassed
the local system, and performed marvelously as a substitute for local phone
service.'
BellSouth's most exciting overseas adventure is arguably in Australia, where
it supplements its cellular business with its partially-owned subsidiary
Optus Communications, the country's second largest long-distance and
business network service operator. The company is also moving into the
currently undeveloped Australian cable television market with its usual team
of local partners.
In some ways, BellSouth appears to be using Australia as a
telecommunications laboratory. As Mr Charles Coe, president of BellSouth
International, says of the company's business there: 'It will define the
full potential of the relationship between telephone and cable TV
operators.' He has such high hopes of the Australia operations that Mr Coe
expects revenues from the country to reach Dollars 1bn by 1996.
Expansion overseas, big spending on technology at home, and new investments
in the cable business - none of this comes cheaply, and like most Baby
Bells, BellSouth has been working hard to contain its escalating costs.
The company, in fact, has been paring its payrolls since 1987, and last year
that process culminated in the announcement of a plan to reduce the total
workforce of about 80,000 by 10,200 before the end of 1996.
The cuts in the plan, which should realise annual savings of Dollars 600m,
come on top of previous workforce reductions totalling 6,500 jobs. To pay
for some of these moves, the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars
1.1bn last year.
BellSouth, however, faces a tough task subduing cost growth because its core
business - providing phone services in the south-east - is expanding so
fast.
'We have an unusual problem - a big growth rate . . . which has complicated
the downsizing (process),' says Mr Clendenin. 'We have to downsize with a
scalpel - we can't not be there to provide service when you move into your
home in Tuscaloosa.'
Mr Clendenin, however, says that the company's target of reducing the
workforce by 10,200 within the next two years could increase if
circumstances dictate.
How this will affect the Atlanta-area - where 16,000 BellSouth employees
work - is uncertain, because BellSouth has not provided a breakdown of where
the cuts will be made. The company, however, is happy to point out that its
business contributes an estimated Dollars 2.5bn a year to the city's
economy.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (8): Bringing a legend to life -
Coming soon / The 'Gone With The Wind' theme park
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MORRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little in Atlanta that would call to mind the legendary Tara
plantation of Gone With the Wind. Historians are fond of noting that the
sprawling, becolumned southern mansions of the type made famous by Hollywood
never existed this far inland. Even the ramshackle house where Margaret
Mitchell penned her famous book has been destroyed by fire.
Tourists, take heart: after years of residing only in the pages of Ms
Mitchell's novel and on the silver screen, Tara - and its sister plantation,
Twelve Oaks - will at last have a home in Atlanta - or at least close to
Atlanta. A California company has announced plans to build a 'Gone With the
Wind Country' theme park near the tiny village of Villa Rica, about 32 miles
west of the city.
Scheduled to open in the spring of 1996, a few months before the summer
Olympics, the Dollars 50m park will be aimed at a mature audience interested
in how the film was produced. Developers hope the main attractions -
replicas of the Tara and Twelve Oaks film sets - will draw 850,000 a year of
the more than 16m tourists who visit Atlanta annually.
The park, expected to employ between 150 and 300 people in its first year,
will feature horseback riding, a Dollars 10m golf course, a Dollars 35m
hotel and a Dollars 17m condominium development, bringing the overall cost
of the complex to more than Dollars 100m by 1997.
The citizens of Villa Rica, a community of 4,000 on Atlanta's 'forgotten'
west side, already are seeing dollar signs. The town describes itself in
tourist literature as a 'City of Gold', and with the construction of Gone
With the Wind Country in their back yard, residents believe they may finally
have struck the mother lode - 'property values are already going up,' says
Jeane Williams of the Villa Rica city council. Her concern is whether the
town is ready to cope with the increased traffic and congestion the
1,200-acre park will bring to this rural community, which until now had
largely escaped development.
Neal McCreary, a Villa Rica property agent, says that Ms Williams has
nothing to fear except the loss of some of Villa Rica's small-town charm.
'All the revenue the park will generate doesn't represent any strain on our
infrastructure,' he says. 'The park itself will not put one additional child
in our schools. That's a good type of revenue to have coming in.'
Andy Henshaw, city manager at the city hall, predicts that the park will
double tax revenues to the town within three to four years - 'everyone is
elated that we're getting the Gone With the Wind theme park. The city
council has been supportive, and most of the citizens can't wait until it's
built.'
The city's business community is also eagerly awaiting the development of
the park - 'this is a dead town,' says Grady Vickery, manager of Dangar's
Feed &amp; Seed. 'There's nothing here to attract people. An attraction like
(Gone With the Wind Country) isn't going to hurt anything.'
He expects the park to give an immediate lift to local hotels and
restaurants, and hopes that he can cash in, too - 'it's Tara, right? They
might have to have something like hogs on that farm. Those animals have got
to eat.'
Whether Gone With the Wind County will share its riches with the likes of Mr
Vickery, remains to be seen, but Mr Henshaw believes the park will turn
Villa Rica into a land of opportunity - 'a lot of our citizens are
under-employed to some degree,' he says. 'What we hope to do is provide
good-paying jobs so they can support their families.'
The cost to the city for the park and the opportunities it may bring is
estimated at Dollars 316,000 for extension of water and sewer services.
Acquisition of right of way for new roads may add to that figure. County,
state and federal governments are pitching in for a highway overpass in an
incentive package valued at more than Dollars 3m.
Snags in the highway overpass construction deal have already delayed
ground-breaking on the park by about a year, according to local newspaper
reports. But park developer Mark Driscoll says the project remains on
schedule for a 1996 opening, the year the of the centennial Olympics.
And Mr Driscoll hopes Gone With the Wind Country will be able to capitalise
on the allure of a state that is already second in the South in terms of
tourism, (behind Florida) and fourth in the country in convention
attendance.
Mr Driscoll is a former employee of Landmark Entertainment Group, which has
designed and produced theme parks for MCA/Universal Studios, Busch
Entertainment, Caesars Palace and Six Flags. He formed Georgia Holdings with
Gary Goddard, Landmark's chief executive, and began searching the Atlanta
metro area for a home for Tara in 1992. Turner Home Entertainment, which
owns rights to the film, has licensed Mr Driscoll to develop a park using
Gone With the Wind as a theme.
It is a theme that vividly defines the American South in the minds of many
people across the world, including many Southerners. But privately, some
local residents of Villa Rica worry that the park's portrayal of an era
rooted in slavery might lead to racial tensions.
For his part, Mr Driscoll has promised to feature the contributions of
African Americans to Southern culture through such facilities as music (the
blues) and food, (barbecues).

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (7): Fanfare for new airport
facilities - Transportation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On September 21, Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport opened its new
Dollars 305m international facility - Concourse E - with as much fanfare as
it could possibly muster.
Hartsfield's managers had good reason to create as much hoopla as possible,
for the facility's opening was the first positive news at the airport in a
long time.
From 1992 until just two months ago, when the name Hartsfield appeared in
headlines it was more often than not accompanied by the words 'scandal' and
'corruption.' An investigation had uncovered corruption in the airport's
concession business. Some of the leading figures in Atlanta's city council,
including Mr Ira Jackson, the former aviation commissioner whose
responsibility it was to run Hartsfield, were found to have accepted bribes
from a company which had been awarded valuable contracts to run some of the
airport's concessions business.
Since that investigation, Mr Jackson and several other defendants, including
the operator of the airport's Paradies chain of shops, have been convicted
of various bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges.
The concessions scandal did more than just sully the airport's and the
city's reputation. The slow progress of the investigation and the court
cases delayed the raising of new funds for the airport and the completion of
important projects, including the construction of Concourse E and the
building of a huge new atrium at the main terminal.
Ms Angela Gittens, who was given the task of restoring Hartsfield's
reputation when she was appointed Atlanta's aviation general manager in
November 1993, admits that morale at the airport was very low when she
arrived - 'we'd been wallowing for quite some time . . . decisions were not
getting made. We couldn't go forward (with the new concourse) because the
principal concessionaire was involved in the scandal. It held up lot of
things.'
The delays set back the international concourse project, and the cost of the
facility ballooned from an originally projected Dollars 244m to more than
Dollars 300m. Consequently, Ms Gittens made opening Concourse E on schedule
her top priority last November. It was a struggle at first, she says - 'it
was about dealing with all of the pieces. To finish the terminal we had to
get the financing. To sell the bonds we had to get (certain) agreements with
the airlines. To get the agreements with the airlines, several issues
outstanding had to be settled . . . we moved forward, piece by piece.'
The airport's managers, however, now believes the worst of the scandal is
behind them, although there is still some controversy over the fact that the
company at the heart of the corruption scandal - Paradies - continues to
operate its Hartsfield concessions. Under Ms Gittens, however, the system
for awarding concessions contracts has been changed  - 'we are now looking
for business acumen (from bidders), not political influence,' she says.
Ultimately, the hope is that the opening of Concourse E and the completion
of the main terminal atrium will focus attention on Hartsfield's future, not
its past.
Concourse E is both an impressive sight - it is the largest international
airport terminal in the US - and an important addition to Hartsfield, which
had outgrown its previous international facilities. It has 24 gates with
room for another ten, and it can handle up to 6,000 passengers an hour,
compared to just 3,400 in the old concourse.
Hartsfield needed a new international facility because its non-domestic
traffic, currently five per cent of total passenger traffic, is expected to
grow in coming years, especially to and from Latin America. This is
primarily a reflection of the airport's reputation as an excellent
connecting hub. Traditionally, Hartsfield has handled more passengers
joining connecting flights than 'origin and destination' passengers, but
that is changing. While origin and destination passengers accounted for just
26 per cent of total traffic four years ago, today they account for 40 per
cent - 'we're no longer just an airport where people change planes,' says Ms
Gittens. In some ways, Hartsfield is a microcosm of the US commerical
aviation business. In 1991, the economic recession and the financial crisis
among many domestic carriers led to a sharp drop in passenger traffic and
revenues, especially after Eastern Airlines, which used Atlanta as a hub,
went out of business.
Yet, the industry - and with it Hartsfield - has been slowly recovering from
the losses and turmoil of the early 1990s, aided by the growth of the local
economy and the arrival of a number of new, predominantly low-cost airlines.
The business which was lost when Eastern collapsed has been more than
recouped with business from new start-up carriers such as ValuJet, Air South
and National Airlines, all of which fly out of Hartsfield.
Ms Gittens says that 'in some ways, Eastern's demise - while unfortunate in
terms of the economy of the area and jobs - created some opportunities for
other carriers, and for more origin and destination traffic. And it offered
the Atlanta-area flying public some opportunities for lower fares.'
Hatsfield has been fortunate in that it has not borne the brunt of the
downsizing by Delta. The financially-strapped airline is headquartered in
Atlanta, uses the airport as its main hub, and is the region's biggest
private employer. Although Delta is in the middle of a huge cost-cutting
programme, Ms Gittens says the carrier has been expanding its operations at
Hartsfield recently.
For now, Altanta's airport looks well set for the future. The Olympic games
in 1996 will give it a chance to grab the spotlight, and see how well its
new international concourse handles a sudden inflow of overseas passengers.
They are likely to be impressed. Hartsfield is user-friendly, with
well-designed terminals connected by an efficient underground rail system,
and linked to Atlanta by a fast and cheap rapid-transit line, the Marta.
These assets have not been overlooked by passengers. For the past four
years, Hartsfield has been selected the best airport in North America by
readers of Business Traveler magazine. With its new international concourse,
and soon a handsome new atrium in the main terminal, Atlanta's airport is
aiming for five in a row.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (8): Harvest in the hotels - Japanese
tourists flock in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing importance of tourism to the Australian economy was underlined
in 1994 by recognition of the diverse and complex sector as a leading stock
exchange investment indicator.
The pooling of nine leading tourism-related companies into a single
indicator, the Tourism and Leisure Index, represented a coming of age for a
sector which has had more than its share of credibility problems with
investors.
While the index will help to make a fragmented industry more accessible and
easier to analyse, it will reflect merely the tip of what is a very large
and growing iceberg. By September this year, companies included in the index
boasted a market capitalisation comfortably above ADollars 3bn, or around
one per cent of the benchmark All Ordinaries index.
But the new index sits atop a sector which now makes up more than 5.5 per
cent of Australia's gross domestic product, employs almost 6 per cent of the
country's workforce, generated foreign exchange earnings exceeding ADollars
10.7bn and accounted for expenditure estimated at Dollars 26.2bn last year.
Although the bulk of that expenditure total - ADollars 18.4bn - came from
domestic tourism, inbound tourism is expected to be the major growth area
for the rest of the century, boosted by Sydney's capture last year of the
2000 Olympic Games.
This climate of growth has already catalysed strong investment. The
Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) has identified tourism-related
accommodation projects worth almost ADollars 5bn scheduled for completion by
1996, including two new casinos.
The activity has also thrown up plans which will test equity markets,
including a float of the Federal Government's flagship airline Qantas,
possible refloating of the rival private airline, Ansett, and privatisation
of the country's airports. These proposals could call on markets for around
ADollars 7bn over the next five years, providing a keen indication of
investor attitudes to the tourism sector.
Some see even more at stake. Many analysts see tourism performance as an
acid test of the wider Australian economy's ability to compete
internationally into the next century. A recent study by ANZ McCaughan, the
Australian stockbroker, says tourism growth will largely reflect the
country's ability to win an increasing share of the global tourism market,
clearly one of the world's biggest industries.
ANZ McCaughan quotes estimates that tourism accounted for around 5.5 per
cent of world gross national product in 1993, with more than 500m tourists
spending almost ADollars 325bn. Tourism is widely forecast to create one in
nine new jobs in the world next year, rising to one in eight by the turn of
the century.
Australia has one crucial advantage in capturing more than its share of this
growth - its location in the Asia-Pacific region, the world's fastest
growing tourist area. ANZ McCaughan says in the 12 years to 1992, tourist
arrivals in the region grew at an annual average of almost 9 per cent, more
than double the world average. Continued regional outperformance is forecast
for the next decade.
Australia has more than matched this regional growth over the past decade,
with arrivals increasing at more than 9 per cent annually. This record, plus
the boost expected from the Olympic Games, recently led the ATC to confirm
its estimate that 6.8m overseas tourists would visit Australia in the year
2000, rising to 8.4m by 2004. This compares with 3.2m actual arrivals in
1993-4.
These forecasts reflect an estimated 2.1m overseas visitors generated
directly over the next decade by the Sydney 2000 Olympics, with the bulk of
business coming from Asia as slow economic recovery and intense competition
curb traffic from Europe and the US.
Japan remained the largest single source of inbound tourists to Australia in
1993, claiming 22.4 per cent of the total. This was shaded by combined
visitors from other Asian sources, which took 22.7 per cent. New Zealand
provided another 16.6 per cent of visitors, the US 9.4 per cent, UK/Ireland
8.1 per cent and other European countries 10.5 per cent.
While less numerous than their Asian counterparts, UK/Ireland and other
European visitors probably contributed more to the Australian economy
because their average stay was around 40 nights compared with just nine
nights for Japan and 32 nights for other Asian countries. The main reason
for the discrepancy appears to be that UK/Ireland and European visitors come
mainly to see relatives while most Asians come primarily for holidays.
ANZ McCaughan's analysis concludes that Australia's inbound tourism record
over the past decade largely reflects the emergence of the country as an
inexpensive place to visit. A weakening currency has helped, but the brokers
calculate that the cost of tourism related services in Australia are now
among the lowest in the industrialised world.
'Australia's tourism infrastructure is generally adequate for present needs
and there is every indication that it can respond quickly to actual and
estimated changes in tourism plans,' the analysis said. 'The national
attractions of Australia are such that great opportunities exist in the
growing eco-tourism market, reflecting in part the preferences of travellers
for more active, participatory or experimental travel experiences.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (7): Trade wind shifts - Pacific is now
the main focus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is trying to transform the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum from a talking shop to an
effective grouping of countries that feel they have been the victims of
strong-arm trade tactics.
His latest mission has involved weeks of intense negotiations aimed at
getting Apec members to establish a free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific
region by 2020.
There is a hint of impatience in Mr Keating's time-frame. He would like an
agreement to be reached in principle during the Apec leaders' November
meeting in Bogor, Indonesia.
If he succeeds,Apec would become more than an obscure acronym for another
bloc of countries trading primarily in raw materials.
For Australia, a completely liberalised trading regime would further
strengthen its presence in the region.
Companies hope free trade will also lead to a freer investment climate, thus
opening opportunities for greater participation in Asia's booming equity
markets.
Mr Bob Lim, director of economic analysis at the Business Council of
Australia, the main employers' body, says uniform rules will provide a quick
way to the regional securities market. 'Australian companies will be more
comfortable with greater transparency and disclosure rules, and with uniform
accounting and other operating standards,' he says.
Mr Keating's free trade proposal has been received favourably among the
Association of South-East Asia Nations (ASEAN). An internal Apec committee
had originally recommended a start-up date 10 years later than Mr Keating's
proposed 2010.
President Soeharto of Indonesia, who will chair the November meeting, has
pledged to place the issue at the top of the Bogor agenda. Indonesia, which
traditionally had the tightest trading regime among ASEAN members,
acknowledges that only by opening up its trade and investment doors can his
country's economic growth be sustained.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, the Singapore prime minister, who is an avowed free
trader, favours an even earlier date - 1998 - for introducing free trade in
the region.
The Canberra-based ASEAN-Australia Business Council said the Apec move will
push forward the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), which began last year.
'The time-table for Apec's phase-in roughly corresponds to that of AFTA, and
the wider Apec membership will bring greater advantages to ASEAN countries,'
the council said.
The accelerated time-table has a built-in sweetener for the developing
member countries. According to the Business Council, the preferred Apec
schedule is for developed countries to dismantle all barriers by 2000, newly
industrialised countries, such as Singapore, by 2005, and developing
countries, such as Indonesia, by 2010.
The idea of Apec was first proposed in January 1989 by Mr Bob Hawke, the
former Australian prime minister, and Mr Keating, then federal treasurer.
The politicians, with tacit backing from Australian business, have decided
to link Australia's future economic prosperity and political stability with
development in Asia.
The increasingly strong ties with the region have helped to cushion the
decline in Australian trade with traditional partners in Europe.
The Asian members of Apec have absorbed an increasing proportion of
Australian exports. Last year, more than 60 per cent of Australian exports
went to these countries, compared with only 26 per cent in 1960. Exports to
the European Union nations have declined to 13 per cent of total exports
last year, from the 50 per cent level in the 1960s.
The agricultural subsidy war between the EU and the US, which could not be
controlled under Gatt, also had serious implications for Apec. Australia and
other agricultural exporters have been thwarted by the high protective wall
built around the EU and the US.
Australia was vulnerable because the subsidies had encroached on its
traditional outlets for wheat, one of its largest foreign exchange earners.
Using whatever influence it had, the Australian Labor government had sought
to get together some of the trading underdogs for a more effective
collective lobbying. It was instrumental in the formation of the Cairns
Group, which consists of non-subsidising exporters, mostly from developing
countries.
The Cairns Group secured a hearing during during the Uruguay Round of the
Gatt talks, but by the close of the 1980s it was obvious that the US and
Japan also had to be involved to make an impression on the importing
countries.
The historic deal struck last December at the end of the seven-year Uruguay
Round placated, albeit momentarily, the free traders. Australia stood to
gain an additional ADollars 5bn (USDollars 3.7bn) in annual exports from the
range of subsidy and tariff cuts agreed upon.
Mr Keating, at the time, claimed the agreement would result in an ADollars
1bn increase in agricultural exports. Wheat sales were expected to rise by
ADollars 250m because the deal would slash the amount of subsidised wheat on
world markets by nearly 50m tonnes between 1995 and 2000.
However, the recent delays in the ratification of the Gatt accords has again
underlined the need to strengthen Apec.
Mr Keating moved quickly and spent much of August and September cajoling
important Apec players to give a political commitment to the promotion of
the free trade.
On a visit to Tokyo last month, Mr Keating appealed to the ideological
leanings of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, in
order to win a half-nod.
Mr Murayama reacted by offering to back regional free trade. However, he
pragmatically advocated extreme caution.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (4): Era of the personality cult - Nikki
Tait explains why the opposition parties keep changing their leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personalities, not policies, have dominated Australia's federal politics of
late.
Perhaps the strongest spotlight has fallen on leadership machinations within
the Liberal Party, the dominant opposition party. Back in early 1993, when
the recession was biting badly, Mr John Hewson, its former leader, lost a
seemingly unlosable election to Paul Keating's incumbent Labor Party. For
over a year, Hewson then limped on as the wave of destabilising rumours and
speculation swelled around him. He finally threw in the towel last May,
calling for a party-room ballot.
The showdown was surprisingly neat. Two aspiring candidates - Mr Peter
Costello, a Victorian lawyer in his late-30s and relative newcomer to
federal politics, and Mr Alexander Downer, Hewson's treasury spokesman -
collaborated to present a joint 'youth ticket'. It won comfortably with Mr
Downer, whose blue-blooded Adelaide family has been involved in politics for
three generations, taking the senior job. Mr Costello became shadow
treasurer.
But matters soon became messy again. Mr Downer, having enjoyed an initial
'honeymoon' in the opinion polls, made a series of public gaffes, the most
serious of which concerned opposition policy towards Aboriginal native title
rights. The recent decision by Mr Andrew Peacock, the veteran Liberal
politician, to quit the federal scene has not been helpful either: while Mr
Peacock has reaffirmed his support, speculation over his successor in the
blue-ribbon seat of Kooyong has provided an opportunity for gossip-mongering
to restart.
In the meantime, the opinion polls have switchbacked, and now give Labor a
clear edge over the opposition. Mr Keating, who has never ranked highly in
the personal popularity stakes, leads Mr Downer as preferred prime minister
by a solid margin.
But while the Labor side of the equation has been better-organised, it has
not been without its own personality upheavals. In early 1994 - and for a
wide variety of reasons - the Keating government lost four ministers,
including John Dawkins, the former treasurer, and Graham Richardson, who
held the health portfolio and was one of the party's key backroom players.
Since then, the cabinet has stabilised, but there has been a not-so-subtle
lining-up of potential Keating successors. No one believes that the prime
minister is set to depart in the short-term. But there is a school of
thought which suggests that if he wins the next election, due in 1996, he
could then step down midway through the next government's term of office.
So Mr Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, has arranged to move from
the Senate (parliament's Upper House) to the House of Representatives. This
would allow his hat to go into the ring. Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former
Western Australian premier who took over Mr Dawkins' seat and Mr
Richardson's portfolio, is another possible contender. Mr Kim Beazley,
finance minister, and Mr Simon Crean, employment, have also been touted as
candidates.
All these comings and goings have tended to mask the legislative vacuum. The
Keating government pushed through key measures, such as the Native Title
legislation and a contentious Industrial Relations act, during its first 12
months of office. This was often uphill work: the government lacks a
majority in the Senate, and the Democrats and a couple of Green Party
senators who hold the balance of power there caused difficulties.
More recently, however, the Keating regime has cooled the tempo. The most
conspicuous feature of its last finance package, for example, was the
absence of any significant new measures. Opponents spoiling for a fight were
left flailing in thin air. The overall result is that the profile of the
minor parties has fallen significantly.
But perhaps the central question now hanging over Australian federal
politics is whether the opposition can find a package of policies which
differentiate it sufficiently from a 'middle-of-the-road' Labor government,
and yet offers greater appeal to the electorate.
This is not an easy task. During the past 10 years, Labor has followed a
moderate reform path.
This has involved putting a programme of tariff reductions in place, nudging
the labour movement towards enterprise-based deals, deregulating key
industrial and financial sectors, pushing the Asia-Pacific links, and so on.
With a fair amount of skill, and helped by a weak opposition, the government
has been moving at its own pace. It has thus retained a broad measure of
consensus support.
The fate of Mr Hewson, whose 'Fightback' package would have pushed the
reforms further and faster, suggests that the Australian electorate will not
be wooed by a more radical economic agenda. So the Downer team is taking a
different tack.
Its first effort has been a broad 'strategy' document called 'The Things
that Matter'. This sets out the main policy areas which the party plans to
develop in more detail during the run-up to the next election. 'Four key
issues define what we believe should be the major priorities of Australia:
the creation of jobs, the strengthening of families, the empowerment of
communities and the restoration of national cohesiveness and independence,'
it reads.
The jury is still out on the wisdom of this approach. Many commentators have
found little to quarrel with in the document, which is also skilfully
packaged. But the big question is the extent to which government niggling
will mean that the rather bland generalisations have to be turned into
detailed, costed policies.
That is when the Labor guns will really fire - if only to divert from a
certain lack of new initiatives on their own side. The next 18 months could
be interesting.

studies the rise of the gambling dens

If the growth in visitors to Australia is a pretty sight, the development of
the country's casino industry - a key factor in the tourism equation - looks
increasingly ugly.
It has been estimated that revenues from Australian casinos could double
over the next five years, to around ADollars 1.25bn per annum, as new
properties in Cairns, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney come on stream.
This will be the third phase of the industry's development. While casinos
have been operating in Tasmania and the Northern Territory for several
decades, these have always been small-scale operations, with aggregate
annual revenues of less than ADollars 50m.
It was only when the Burswood casino got going outside Perth in 1985,
followed by Jupiters on Queensland's Gold Coast, that the dollar signs
started to clock up. Burswood has around 116 tables, and Jupiters almost as
many. The other seven casinos sprinkled across Australia are only in
double-digits, and Alice Springs' has fewer than 20 tables. Burswood alone
accounted for 40 per cent of the industry's ADollars 657m revenues in
1992-3.
Today, there are two principal reasons why other big states, such as
Victoria and New South Wales, are clambering on to the same bandwagon. The
first is an acute desire to attract the Asian tourist dollar - or, at the
very least, not to lose out to competing cities and states. According to
projections from the NSW Casino Control Authority, the number of
international visitors to the Sydney property could top the million-mark by
the year 2000, compared with 1.1-2.2m domestic visitors and 6-7.5m local
visitors or day-trippers.
Secondly, state treasurers, eager to relieve their budgetary pressures, see
tax revenues from gaming dollars as a fairly efficient means of raising new
funds. Consultants say that the substitution effect - the drop in
racing-related revenues, for example, as punters adjust their activities -
is relatively modest.
But as the stakes are raised, the disquiet is growing. In Melbourne, where a
temporary casino opened early this year, there have been reports of a
proliferation of 'gambling problems'. Pawnshops are said to be seeing a
surge in business, and financial difficulties, notably within the city's
large Asian community, are rife.
Meanwhile, the Sydney casino development has degenerated into a dirty brawl
between the business interests of Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian
businessman who already has a significant stake in the Melbourne operation,
and a consortium of Showboat, the US casino group, and Leighton Holdings,
the Australian building company.
Leighton-Showboat appeared to win the right to build and operate the Sydney
property earlier this year, outbidding the Packer consortium, which also
included the US's Circus Circus, by offering an upfront payment of ADollars
376m.
But since then, the Packer camp has unleased a barrage of accusations about
Showboat's probity. Mr Bob Carr, the NSW Labor opposition leader, has
levelled some of the more detailed allegations, which hang on fairly tenuous
links between Showboat and a Louisiana mob figure and seem to baffle US
analysts. Confidential US police reports have been leaked; public relations
advisers and lawyers spurred into action.
The CCC, having assured everyone that extensive probity checks had been
carried out before the Leighton-Showboat choice was made, has set up an
inquiry to look into the allegations.
Sydney residents, meanwhile, tend to view the whole business with a mixture
of contempt and cynicism. Two previous attempts to award a Sydney casino
licence - in 1986 and 1987 - went awry when individuals or companies
involved in the winning bids ran into controversy. It is now a question of
whether the third time is any more lucky.

Shaking up the big state monopolies remains an urgent priority

ONE of the greatest pieces of infrastructure redevelopment in Australia is
arguably the conversion of rail freight lines connecting the mainland
capital cities into a single, standard-gauge network.
By the middle of 1995, and for the first time in the country's history,
goods being transported from one state to another will no longer be delayed
by differences in rail track widths.
Until 1982, a journey from Brisbane on the east coast, to Perth, on the
west, involved five changes of gauge, shifting from narrow to standard to
broad and back to narrow. To move goods across, bogie exchanges were
installed to change bogies underneath the waggon and enable the transfer of
containers.
Over recent years, standard tracks have gradually been installed across
borders so that today the Melbourne to Adelaide corridor is the only missing
link in a standardised national system. This is now being rectified, with
the construction expected to be finished by May 1995.
The system's inefficiency has long bedevilled Australian business, which has
borne the cost and consequence on its competitiveness. The Bureau of
Industry Economics, which has examined the performance of Australia's
infrastructure against world competitors, says that Australian rail freight
charges are at least twice as high as its cheapest competitor. Its
productivity was only 27 per cent of the world's best performer in 1991-92.
The state of the nation's railway system reflects how practices and
institutions established by individual colonies in the 19th century have
continued beyond the federation, thus presenting a major obstacle to a
single, national and competitive economy. It is no wonder, then, that the
ruling Labor government has made state enterprises the target of the latest
phases of its macro-economic reform.
During the last 10 years, the federal government's reform programme has seen
the deregulation of the financial and labour markets. Today, reform is aimed
at state corporations and authorities, which have almost total control over
infrastructure facilities.
Earlier this year, the Commonwealth government adopted an
internally-generated report on national competition policy, the so-called
Hilmer Report, which recommends that state government enterprises be opened
to free competition. Also being freed-up are statutory marketing bodies and
unincorporated enterprises, such as the professions, particularly the legal
sector. These three areas have until now been immune to the Trade Practices
Act.
Infrastructure costs are over 10 per cent of the input of all of Australia's
industries. The Bureau of Industry Economics study has found that in terms
of price, reliability and efficiency, Australian infrastructure was below
world best practice, in some cases substantially so.
The government estimates that reforms in state-run utilities would increase
national output by ADollars 8bn (USDollars 5.5bn) a year.
Although the state governments have generally agreed to implement the Hilmer
Report, it is nevertheless an arduous task for the Commonwealth government.
It is dealing with eight states and territories, all fiefdoms with different
politics, different views of competition, and where business enterprises
have different structures and are covered by different laws.
The first hurdle has already appeared. This is the issue of compensation for
the states who stand to lose 'monopoly rents' provided by the enterprises.
When these are privatised, the income will flow directly to the Commonwealth
government as company tax.
At a meeting in August between the Commonwealth and state governments, the
heads of states and the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, were deadlocked on
the level of compensation. Understandably, the states wanted to get more,
whereas the Commonwealth wanted give less.
A Commonwealth bureaucrat said that some states justified their high demands
by pointing at the steeply-rising revenues from state enterprises. He said
it was unclear how much of the increases were due to excessive charges or to
the increasing proportion of profits paid to states as dividends.
The issue was resolved with the states asking the Industry Commission to
examine the yearly increase in Commonwealth revenues as a result of the
reform. A commonly-agreed formula will then be set for splitting revenues.
The states have widely differing approaches to implementing the programme.
Victoria has been implementing an aggressive privatisation team since the
Liberal government took power three years ago.
Mr Alan Stockdale, the Victorian treasurer, showed a hint of concern that
privatisation already accomplished may be excluded from the revenue-sharing.
'The Industry Commission is working with a brief from the state treasurers
and it will clearly consider all relevant issues, including retroactive
compensation,' he said.
Queensland, meanwhile, resists the sale of public assets, claiming that,
unlike Victoria, it does not carry a debt burden and therefore does not need
to have a fire sale.
However, it has in recent years introduced a 'corporate culture' in state
enterprises, which has resulted in some efficiency gains. Western Australia
alone has refused to surrender its utilities to a national competition law.
But Mr Stockdale said the different approaches are a natural part of the
co-operative process. 'There are some differences but I believe everyone is
genuine about their commitment to national competition,' he said.
Mr Stockdale, who is recognised as the architect of the Victorian
privatisation programme, considers the electricity industry as deserving the
top priority for de-regulation. He said Victoria has slipped from the lowest
cost electricity supplier in the 1960s to the most expensive on the eastern
seaboard.
He would like to turn that round to regain competitive advantage.
The first sale, that of a power generator, is due next year. The government
expects that before 1996 there will be free competition for generation and
distribution in the state. The core transmission grid will remain a state
monopoly.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (5): Regional banking contrasts -
Moves to counter an encroachment by the Carolina giants / The banks have
benefited greatly from the robust health of the regional economy, which
survived the 1990-1991 nationwide recession virtually unscathed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

To the dismay of some proud Georgians, three of the five biggest banks in
the Atlanta region hail from North Carolina. Of the three out-of-state
banks, two are based in Charlotte (Nationsbank and First Union) and one in
Winston-Salem (Wachovia). The lone Atlanta banks are SunTrust (which owns
the venerable Trust Company of Georgia franchise), and Bank South, the
smallest of the big five.
The supremacy of the Carolina banks is a relatively recent phenomenon. In
1984, when the south-eastern compact - a series of agreements between states
in the south-east to block takeovers of local institutions by banks from
outside the region - was forged, Atlanta was the region's business capital,
and its banks appeared well-placed to prosper accordingly.
However, over the following decade while Georgia banks were stifled by the
weight of cumbersome and antiquated state banking regulations, North
Carolina banks were expanding rapidly through aggressive acquisitions made
possible by a much more flexible regulatory environment.
By the early 1990s, consolidation among banks in the south- east had created
a new breed of 'super regionals,' and three such giants - NationsBank, First
Union and Wachovia - were firmly encamped on Atlanta banks' turf.
The largest Atlanta-based bank before consolidation was the C&amp;S Corporation.
After a series of strategic blunders, it was taken over by NCNB of Charlotte
in a deal that created NationsBank, now the biggest super regional in the
US. First Union and Wachovia also bought banks from Georgia and other
south-eastern states.
The contrast between the development of banking in North Carolina and
Georgia explains how the Atlanta banks lost their way, says Mr John Coffey,
a bank analyst at the Atlanta securities firm of Robinson-Humphrey.
'North Carolina is almost a laboratory for banking, it's been so
progressive. The state itself looks like what banking in the US will
probably look like in 10 or 20 years. There are three big players who
control 55 per cent of the market, and they are another 80 who control the
remainder. In Georgia, there are 300 banks, yet it's a similar-sized market
to North Carolina.'
The encroachment of the Carolina giants, however, does not mean that
Atlanta's two surviving big banks have languished these past few years.
Quite the opposite. The conservatively-run SunTrust has become one of the
most profitable banks in the country, and Bank South has performed a
remarkable comeback from loan problems which at one point looked as if they
might overwhelm the bank in 1991.
Both banks, as well as the three from North Carolina, have benefited greatly
from the robust health of the regional economy, which survived the 1990-1991
nationwide recession virtually unscathed, and which continues to post
above-average growth.
Mr James Williams, SunTrust's chairman, attributes a great deal of his
bank's successes to the strength of the local economy. Under the stewardship
of its safety-first management, SunTrust has achieved the remarkable record
of never having reported a decline in annual earnings. In 1993, the bank
earned Dollars 474m, 17 per cent more than in 1992, and this year SunTrust
is on target to record earnings growth of 10 per cent.
Although the bank's assets have grown from Dollars 5bn to Dollars 40bn in
the past 10 years, Mr Williams says only half of that growth has come from
acquisitions - the remainder has been derived from internal growth.
Remaining true to its conservative philosophy, SunTrust sticks to what it
knows best: loans to mid-sized companies; its long-established trust
business, which serves the needs of many of Atlanta's richest families;
retail banking and mortgage lending; and fund management. The bank also owns
a big stake in Coca-Cola which it has held since helping the company go
public in 1919, and which is now worth Dollars 1.2bn.
Typical of the SunTrust strategy is its recent move into the mutual fund
business. Since its entry last year, the bank has built up a stable of 19
mutual funds with assets of Dollars 4.5bn. The funds are proving popular and
profitable, and the bank's chairman admits they were a bit tardy in
exploiting the mutual fund boom - 'we should have been in earlier,' says Mr
Williams, 'but we got in carefully. When we did it, we did it right, and we
are now highly successful.'
In sharp contrast to SunTrust's steady but unspectacular progress, Bank
South's recent history resembles a rollercoaster ride. In 1991 the bank was
close to failure, burdened by too many problem property loans, but new
management arrived that year under the leadership of several former C&amp;S
executives, including turnaround expert Mr Patrick Flinn.
With Mr Flinn as chairman, Bank South cleaned up its loan book, and
rebounded strongly, forging a name for itself as Atlanta's community bank.
With more than 80 per cent of the bank's business in the Atlanta
metropolitan area, it fully deserves that title. As Mr Coffey of
Robinson-Humphrey explains: 'They're the local independent bank that is more
willing to serve you than those Yankee interlopers from North Carolina.
That's the way they position themselves.'
An aggressive and innovative marketing campaign, some astute acquisitions in
the metropolitan region, and several fast-growing businesses including
mutual funds and discount broking, have all helped turn Bank South into
Atlanta's premier retail bank.
The successes of SunTrust and Bank South means they are regarded as juicy
targets for takeover by larger banks in the region, or from outside the
south east (the region's compact is in the process of being dismantled, and
interregional banking will soon become the norm).
For Bank South, the prospect of being taken over does not seem to have
quelled its appetite for expansion - 'of all of them, Bank South is probably
the most acquisitive,' says Mr Coffey. 'They will probably continue to
cement their franchise in Atlanta. At the same time they are the most
often-mentioned takeover target, just by virtue of their size. As a result,
their stock price reflects it.'
The analyst, however, does not think that anyone will make a move on Bank
South soon - 'no one could buy them without incurring significant earnings
dilution. Their (defence strategy) is independence through performance,
rather than through size.'
Size, however, may prove a good defence for SunTrust. That, at least, is the
belief of its chairman Mr James Williams, who says the bank's size (assets
of Dollars 6.6bn), plus the premium that any acquirer would have to pay,
makes SunTrust too much for most banks too swallow.
A merger of equals involving SunTrust is seen by analysts as a more likely
outcome, and Wachovia of North Carolina is regarded as the bank that would
make the snuggest fit. For the moment, however, SunTrust is concentrating on
growing its earnings and completing a massive share buyback programme - it
has already spent Dollars 300m on acquiring 7m shares and has the approval
to buy another 5m - and shying away from talk of acquisitions and mergers.
Mr Coffey says of SunTrust's management: 'I think they see more value in
paying for their own stock than someone else's'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (4): A once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity - Venue for the 1996 Olympics / Atlanta stands to prosper much
from the Olympics. In return, the guardians of the Olympic movement know
they will get a superbly organised sporting extravaganza, delivered via the
latest technology to several billion homes around the globe

After visiting Atlanta for even a few short days, it is impossible not to
marvel at the feat achieved four years ago, when the International Olympic
Committee was persuaded to award the centennial games to this thriving, but
in many ways unremarkable, American city.
In September 1990, most observers believed Athens would be chosen as host
for 1996. Given the historic ties between the Greek city and the Olympics -
the first modern games were held there in 1896, so there would have been a
perfect symmetry in returning a century later - the allure of Athens must
have been powerful. Atlanta, in contrast, was a city best known for having
been razed to the ground during the Civil War. How could it possibly win
against Athens?
Mr Billy Payne, the Atlanta lawyer whose idea it was in the first place to
bid for the Olympics and who spearheaded the campaign to win the centennial
games, is still not quite sure exactly how it happened. Suffice to say, he
remembers the vote for Atlanta in 1990 as a 'miracle.'
At the time, there was much cynical carping about how Atlanta won the games
because, like Los Angeles in 1984, it would generate huge profits for the
Olympic movement. Or because Coca-Cola, the long-time Olympic sponsor, was
based in the city. Or because only American organisational know-how could
cope with the logistic nightmare that the games had become.
However, Mr Payne, who is now president of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games (ACOG), insists that Atlanta's victory had nothing to do with
money, or corporate influence, or notions of competence - 'we had a strategy
. . . that at this most important time in sports history, the people who had
the power to award the right to host these games would do so to people that
they trusted and that they liked. So we set about to do nothing more
complicated than to assure them that they could trust us to take the Olympic
movement into our custody at this important time, and do it great honour and
justice. It was just that simple.'
It was also a simple fact back in 1990, however, that Atlanta stood to
prosper hugely from the Olympics, and the Olympics from Atlanta.
The latest economic impact study estimates that Atlanta and the state of
Georgia will benefit to the tune of 80,000 jobs and Dollars 5.1bn in direct
and indirect spending, with a minimum Dollars 200m in incremental sales tax
revenue pouring into state coffers. In return, the guardians of the Olympic
movement know they will get a superbly organised sporting extravaganza,
delivered via the latest technology, and with the backing of some of the
world's largest companies, to several billion homes around the globe.
All of the money needed to run the games will come out of private sector
pockets (although a small amount of public funds will be be spent on areas
such as security, transportation and street repair). Yet, in spite of the
financial success of the Los Angeles games, Mr Payne says that raising
Dollars 1.6bn has not been easy - 'we started in a very difficult economy in
1990, and so it's happened a little bit slower than we wanted it to. Of the
Dollars 1.6bn, between the amounts already under contract through television
revenues and sponsorships, and the amounts that will come later from
tickets, merchandising and concessions ..we're about 92 per cent complete.
So we've got to raise another Dollars 150m, and we've already got the
companies and product categories targeted.'
Construction of the new Olympic stadium and the athletes village is well
under way and on target to meet the completion deadlines. Of the Dollars
1.6bn that will be spent on the 1996 games, about 35 per cent of the money
will come from television (NBC paid a record Dollars 456m for the US
rights), another approximately 35 per cent from corporate sponsors (such as
Coca-Cola, IBM, Visa International and Matsushita), 15 per cent from ticket
sales, 10 per cent from licensing and related merchandising sales, and a
final 5 per cent from the sale of Olympic-related assets after the games are
complete. And in theory, when it is all over the Atlanta games should
register a profit.
Inevitably, the people of the Atlanta, its community leaders and its
politicians are keen to know what how they will profit from the games.
Managing civic expectations, in fact, has been one of ACOG's toughest tasks.
In 1990, it was hoped that considerable Olympics-related money would be
spent on improving conditions in Atlanta's blighted inner city areas.
Although some spending on infrastructure and services is planned, and
Dollars 8.1m has been pledged from the Woodruff Foundation to help spruce up
some neighbourhoods, many of those expectations have not been met. Over the
past few years, the Corporation for Olympic Development in Atlanta (the body
created by the former mayor, Mr Maynard Jackson, to lead the city's efforts
to leverage the games) has identified Dollars 238m in public works that it
believes are needed in the city.
Yet, private sector funds have not been forthcoming for those works, which
has created some bitterness within the community. Pressure groups like the
Atlanta Olympic Conscience Coalition, which wants to see housing and
development in the inner city neighbourhoods tied to the games, want the
Olympics to do more for Atlanta's neediest communities.
While Mr Payne says that hopes were too high from the start, he admits that
the city and the organisers were slow to address the needs of the local
community - 'there was originally an anticipation that it would not get done
unless the Olympic committee paid for it. That was an unrealistic
expectation,' he says.
'Now, however, we have a very pro-active mayor, a state that is beginning to
feel the Olympics extend beyond Atlanta, and a private community that
supports the projects like the park (the Dollars 50m, 60-acre Centennial
Park that will be constructed in downtown Atlanta for the games) . . . but
the Olympics are not a cure-all for every social issue that possesses this
urban environment.'
Arguments over who should benefit from the Olympics and how to divide the
spending pie, however, are as old as the games themselves. Ultimately, few
in Atlanta are likely to complain that the Olympics should never have
arrived on their doorstep. For a place that has been proclaiming itself as
'the next great international city' for the best part of 50 years, the games
are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make an impact on the world stage.
Atlanta, a city that does not exactly suffer from a lack of self-confidence,
is primed to do just that.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (6): A man with a message -
Personality profile, Billy Payne, an Olympics altruist / It might be going a
bit far to describe Billy Payne as an Olympic evangelist, but not too far
</HEADLINE>

When Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games discusses the centennial games to be held in Atlanta in 1996, he
speaks with the passion of a preacher. When he steps out of his office on to
his balcony with its view of downtown Atlanta, and spreads his arms wide to
describe the planned layout for the new Olympic park, he looks as if he is
ready to deliver a sermon to an assembled flock below.
Seven years ago, Payne certainly needed a strong sense of belief in himself
 -if not a higher being - when he came up with the idea of launching an
Atlanta bid for the 1996 games. Most people at the time thought he was mad.
Even three years later, when the city's highly professional bid had been
submitted to the International Olympic Committee, few thought he stood much
of a chance of succeeding.
However, since that day in September 1990, when the IOC upset the odds and
picked Atlanta over the sentimental favourite Athens, no one has made the
mistake of under-estimating Payne again.
A 46-year-old attorney and former star college American football player,
Payne shares the lofty ideals and cheerful optimism of another Georgian who
burst on to the world stage from relative obscurity - former president Jimmy
Carter. And like Carter, Payne places a lot of faith in his ability to get
people to trust and like him. The secret to Atlanta's successful bid in
1990, says Payne, was the fact that IOC members trusted and liked Payne and
his team.
They must have also liked what he had to say - that Atlanta would do more
than just put on a highly efficient games - 'organisationally, logistically,
technologically, we're going to be the best that the world has to offer. And
yet, that's not a big enough goal. The Olympic movement is not about
objective achievements, it's not about saying our venues were the best, or
our transportation plan was the best. It's about whether or not we advance
that which is good about the Olympic movement.'
Furthermore, it is proof of the power of co-operation and friendship that
Payne sees as the Olympics' lasting legacy. As he puts it: 'I am unaware of
an international idea that has ever been articulated that has the potential
and the power of the Olympic movement.'
That potential, of course, has not always been realised in past games -
boycotts in Moscow and Los Angeles, terrorism in Munich. So when Payne spoke
to IOC members about Atlanta's bid, he said of the Olympic movement: 'It has
often been abused and misused, and it's been 100 years boys, so let's get it
straightened out now.'
Today, the preparations certainly seem straightened out - most of the money
for the games is raised, construction of the Olympic stadium and the
athlete's village is well under way. In spite of having to overcome some
early political hurdles, Payne says he was always confident that Atlanta
could put on a good show.
'The second we were awarded the games, and the words came out of President
Samaranch's mouth - 'The city of Atlanta' - the success of these games was
absolutely assured. There is now way the United States of America would not
do whatever it took to meet or exceed the expectations of the world.'
Atlanta, of course, should benefit hugely from the Olympics in terms of the
local economy and the region's image in the US and the wider world. For
this, Payne is a hero to many Atlantans, and people say that after the
summer of 1996 he could run for, and win, political office in Georgia.
Billy Payne, however, is very much the altruist. Like another former
president, he asks not what the Olympics can do for Atlanta, but what
Atlanta can do for the Olympics - 'if success is measured only in what
Atlanta gets out of it, then these games will have been a horrible failure.
We have got to give something back to the Olympic movement.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (3): The lining is golden - Mines
survive new land rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<TEXT>
For the Australian mining industry the much feared 'era of Mabo' has begun
without interrupting the long-standing trend of steadily increased
production and export revenue.
Mabo is the popular tag given to a watershed High Court decision given
legislative effect late in 1993 through the Native Title Bill. The Bill,
which broadly gives Australia's Aboriginal people title to large tracts of
the country, had drawn dire predictions from the mining lobby, mainly
reflecting concerns about exploration and development access.
However, in 1993-4, the industry has again overcome weak world demand,
historically low prices for many key commodities and unfavourable exchange
rate movements marginally to lift export revenue to almost ADollars 30bn,
accounting for better than 35 per cent of the country's total export
receipts.
Figures from ABARE, the Federal Government's commodities research arm, show
that Australia's mineral exports have risen in all but one year of the past
decade. The latest total represents more than double the country's then
record ADollars 14.9bn mineral exports in 1986.
While this performance justifies the industry's world leader status,
demonstrating its inherent strength and diversity, closer inspection reveals
some weak spots which threaten to reduce momentum later this decade.
The industry acknowledges that the effects on production and revenues may
not be felt for some years, given the lead times involved in major projects.
But mining executives see Mabo as part of a long term pattern of adversity
which includes the rise of environmental issues, compensation claims from
landowners, unfavourable tax treatment and vexatious litigation.
Mr Geoffrey Ewing, of the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC), says
the mining industry has long been a leader in negotiating with Aboriginal
communities. 'Our argument is not with the concept of native title, but with
the way the Bill produces an unwieldy system for exploration and development
access,' Mr Ewing said.
'Any real influence on production and exports is obviously some years off.
In fact, our annual financial survey, due out later this year, will probably
show a lift in exploration spending in the latest year. But our information
is that the spending is mainly on what could be described as 'brownfields',
sites which are free of any native title claims.'
The Australian mineral industry's overall performance in the latest year was
also distorted by near boom conditions in one commodity - gold - where
export value rose by more than 26 per cent to ADollars 5.42bn, masking some
serious declines in other commodities.
Gold's resurgence echoes its historical position as one of the main
populators of fledgling antipodean colonies more than a century ago. The
metal's more recent Australian history is scarcely less important to
national fortunes.
From a position of decline in the 1970s, when many of the country's biggest
mines faced closure and annual output ran at less than three tonnes,
Australian gold production has rallied close to 250 tonnes in the current
year, ranking it third in the world after South Africa and the US.
And new projects already under way mean that production will keep rising
strongly, barring a collapse in the all-too-volatile gold price. Mr Robin
Widdup, gold analyst with J. B. Were &amp; Son, the Australian stockbrokers,
told the Financial Times World Gold Conference in June that Australia's
annual gold production was likely to top 300 tonnes by the turn of the
century.
Vigorous exploration and new mine development has transformed the gold
industry from the 1980s picture of short life, shallow oxide open pits, to
large long life mines in the 1990s,' Mr Widdup said. 'The 1990s Australian
gold rush has seen geologists, armed with new geochemical and geophysical
techniques, unearth a series of large new gold discoveries beneath sand
cover.
'This breakthrough in technology has lifted exploration expenditure  .. and
the rate of success shows no sign of slowing. A group of 10 to 15 new mines
should lift Australian production by 40 to 50 tonnes over the next five
years.'
If gold fulfils these expectations, it could replace coal as Australia's
number one export earner around the turn of the century. Gold's export jump
in the latest year compared with a corresponding 5 per cent fall to just
under ADollars 7.2bn for coal.
Several other major Australian minerals recorded solid export revenue gains
in 1993-94, including aluminium, up 5 per cent to ADollars 1.82bn and iron,
steel and ferroalloys, up 22 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. But zinc exports
fell 22 per cent to ADollars 795m.
Sticking to a familiar pattern, Australia's higher overall export receipts
were achieved despite markedly lower average commodity prices received.
ABARE's mineral export price index slumped from 99.7 to 91.9 over the year
while the index of mine production rose from 105.2 to 107.
Australia is, quite simply, continuing to sell more minerals for less money.
The financial performance of its leading commodities companies remains
volatile. It's a habit that will prove hard to kick while the industry
remains a price taker, hostage to a small local market and heavily exposed
to the vagaries of international trade.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (2): It's getting stronger - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a short-term view, the Australian economy looks as palatable as the
country's awesome beaches. On medium-term view, conditions are less certain,
writes NIKKI TAIT.
About a year ago, the country started to pull out of recession with
unexpected strength. Annual growth in gross domestic product hit the five
per cent mark early in 1994, before easing back to 4.3 per cent in the
second quarter. Inflation remained (and remains) low: the annual increase in
the consumer price index ran at 1.7 per cent in the same period.
Moreover, while consumer demand was the driving force in the recovery's
early stages, this is finally generating a pickup in business confidence. As
a result, the government's crucial target for business investment - a 14.5
per cent rise in 1994/5 - seems more attainable. There was a 'high
probability' of this increase being reached or even surpassed, remarked Ted
Evans, one of the treasury's senior officials, in September.
So, with some justification, Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's unassuming
treasurer, has been able to declare that his country has never looked better
placed to achieve a prolonged period of economic growth.
But even Mr Willis would not pretend that the skies are cloudless.
The most immediate concern is the severe drought which has hit key
agricultural areas on the east coast. The effects of this are still felt
widely, and it is hard to assess the final impact.
But, already, production of wheat, a significant export category for
Australia, is forecast to almost halve from around 17m tonnes last year to
10.4m tonnes in 1994/5. Feed costs for livestock producers are increasing,
and prices of both animal and grain-based products could rise. Rural
hardship cases are fairly widespread, prompting the government to announce a
ADollars 164m package of emergency aid measures, spread over two years. At
present, official estimates suggest that around half a percentage point may
be knocked off the nation's growth rate as a result of the drought.
Secondly, in spite of the strong growth rate, Australia's unemployment
situation remains grim. A year into the recovery, the jobless rate stands at
9.5 per cent, and the emphasis which the corporate sector is still putting
on productivity improvements suggests that any rapid decline is unlikely.
Some forecasts have indicated that a national growth rate of around 3.5 per
cent for the rest of the decade would still leave the jobless rate at seven
per cent by the year 2000. A growth rate of 4.5-5 per cent might get
unemployment down to five per cent.
Such predictions encouraged the federal government to launch a ADollars
6.5bn 'jobs programme' earlier this year. Its initiatives were various, but
included the offer of either subsidised employment, mainly in the private
sector, or work experience and training to all long-term unemployed people
of 18-plus.
The package was given the best possible gloss, and much of the cost is
actually spread over a four-year period. Nevertheless, while it was quickly
judged to be politically-astute, the business and financial community was
less impressed. In spite of government reassurances that it was sticking to
its deficit reduction strategy - which aims to cut the deficit to around one
per cent of gross domestic product by 1996/7 - it would have preferred a
faster rate of reduction, and more margin for error.
These calls were revoiced by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, in
September and Mr Willis has suggested that they will be borne in mind in
shaping the next budget.
Thirdly, there is the matter of Australia's external account. Australia's
current account deficit has stabilised at around four per cent of GDP in
recent years, but the concern is that the balance of trade could go out of
kilter as business investment gets under way and imports of plant and
machinery surge.
Many analysts do predict some worsening of the current account: Bankers
Trust, for example, recently predicted ADollars 22bn deficit in 1995/6, or
4.5 per cent of GDP, although it adds that such a level 'will not pose a
serious problem for the economy'. Since then, the August trade figures have
been released - and the much larger-than-expected current account deficit
fuelled the pessimists' worst fears.
The authorities' response, meanwhile, centres on the huge effort to promote
Asian trade, and encourage Australian exports to the region. This, it is
hoped, could offset the rise in imports.
But most pundits also acknowledge that that there is an element of guesswork
in all of this. No one yet knows how strongly-sustained Australia's export
performance will be, nor the extent of any import surge. If the current
account does 'blow out', it is widely assumed that interest rate or tax
increases might have to follow - the political hope presumably being for the
latter - and that this could occur after the next federal election, in 1996.
Finally, there is the question of internal 'structural' reforms. Ministers
frequently point to the progress made by Australia over the past decade - in
terms of the steady lowering of tariff barriers, the move to replace
centralised wage agreements by enterprise-based bargains, the reduction in
the number of industrial disputes, the introduction of competition into key
sectors such as telecommunications, and so on. There is, moreover, an
ongoing effort to push the process further, especially at state level.
But the outside world, including the all-important Asia region, is sometimes
less appreciative. It still tends to see sporadic, but high-profile,
national strikes (in the coal and shipping industries, for example);
Australia's low savings ratio, contrasting sharply with that of its northern
neighbours; and the nation's egalitarian culture which distrusts commercial
success.
One recent survey of international competitiveness, by the International
Institute of Management Development, put Australia in 15th place, roughly
level pegging with the UK and Canada. Singapore, by contrast, came in second
to the US, Hong Kong was fourth, and even Malaysia and Taiwan managed 17th
and 18th places, respectively.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (2): Investment keeps the economy
bubbling - Diversity of business sectors has helped Atlanta weather
financial setbacks - Atlanta is pinning many of its economic hopes on what
the 1996 Olympics will render
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The economic outlook for Atlanta is as cloudless as its best summer day. The
1996 Olympics have only strengthened what already was a strong positive
trend.
'The Atlanta economy continues to expand at boom conditions with no evidence
of serious slowing,' comments Mr Don Ratajczak, director of the Economic
Forecasting Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
Atlanta suffered only the mildest of downturns during the 1990-1991 US
recession. Although the collapse of Eastern Airlines helped produce a net
job loss of 20,500 in 1991, that has been the only negative figure for jobs
in the entire decade between 1984 and 1993, see table below.
In the ten years between 1984 and 1993, 487,600 net new jobs were created in
Atlanta, including 83,500 in 1993. (And, through the first six months of
this year, Mr Ratajczak says that job growth was 89,300 above the previous
year).
The diversity of Atlanta's economy, encompassing transportation, automotive
manufacturing, wholesale distribution, ample retail, conventions and
tourism, biotechnology, and telecommunications, has helped it weather the
setbacks of any particular segment.
Furthermore, its attractive local business conditions have proven a magnet
for investment. In the period from 1984 to 1993, 1,506 companies, including
361 foreign businesses, have relocated to Atlanta and brought Dollars 80bn
in investment.
Between January and June this year, 83 more new companies, including 13
foreign businesses, expanded or relocated in Atlanta. According to the
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, they represent a real estate investment alone
of nearly Dollars 60m.
Compared with the rest of the state of Georgia, metro Atlanta has been the
overwhelmingly preferred site for relocation of foreign companies, which
have more than Dollars 10bn invested in Georgia, according to a recent
survey by KPMG Peat Marwick.
The survey of 741 foreign-owned companies in Georgia found that the top
three investors were the UK with Dollars 2.3bn, Japan with Dollars 2.2bn and
the Netherlands with Dollars 1.5bn.
A Lou Harris poll last year found that Atlanta was the first choice for
locating a new facility by executives from the International Fortune 1,000.
The city's relatively low operating costs, excellent transport facilities,
reasonably priced housing and many amenities have helped it consistently
rank among the top choices for relocation by US companies. Atlanta and
Georgia also offer a number of tax and other incentives that make the choice
more attractive.
While investment has kept Atlanta's economy steadily bubbling, the Olympics
has helped it become positively effervescent.
More than Dollars 600m in Olympic construction is helping to drive a
construction boom that was already under way in housing. Another Dollars
150m in city infrastructure improvements approved in July will push
construction even higher.
Home building has risen not only with the drop in interest rates, but
because Atlanta is drawing more people to it from other regions than any
other city in America. More than 86,000 new people arrived in Atlanta in
1993, leading Mr Ratajzcak to predict that nearly 40,000 new households will
be built this year and next.
Some analysts have even suggested that speculative commercial building,
which flooded downtown Atlanta with office space during the 1980s, could
start again as early as next year.
Vacancy rates are headed down and real estate investment is looking up. In a
survey of large institutional investors, the Real Estate Research
Corporation recently rated Atlanta the top investment market.
'The Olympics co-incided with what was going to turn around, anyway,'
observes Mr Andy Krikelas, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank
in Atlanta.
Atlanta's key transportation industry is showing strong gains despite
continued lay-offs by Delta, the third largest US airline which has its
headquarters in the city. However, innovative airlines such as Kiwi and
ValuJet are helping mitigate the effects.
The important business of trade shows and conventions - Atlanta ranks as the
fourth largest convention centre in the US - has improved this year. And,
according to Mr Krikelas, there may even be potential for more retail
development now that 'consumers are coming back.' He believes Atlanta's
economy is 'pretty strong right now - and we expect it to remain strong
through the Olympics.'
Although healthy growth seems assured through the 1996 Olympics, there are
questions about what will happen afterwards. Measuring by the usual business
cycle, it would be time for a recession.
But some expect that Atlanta's economic fizz will not stop. The city's
mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, says that many infrastructure projects will extend
past 1996 and will help keep some bouyancy in the local economy. Mr
Ratajzcak also believes that construction will have a post-Olympic 'soft
landing' because commercial real estate will once again just be picking up.
Yet, Atlanta is pinning many of its economic hopes on what the Olympics will
render. Various campaigns to market Atlanta using the Olympics are underway
and are largely dedicated to winning international investment.
'If Atlanta pulls off the Olympics and does well, we'll get a lot of free
advertising,' says Mr Krikelas. But if the event comes off badly, he warned
that the city could be headed for a painful hang-over after the party.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (3): City's influence is still
dominant - Regional political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlanta's local political scene can be a little confusing at first glance -
'there is no such thing as an Atlanta government,' says Tim Crimmins, a
Georgia State University history professor and local political analyst.
The reason is that metro Atlanta, with 2.9m inhabitants, is composed of the
city of Atlanta, a relatively smallish central city, and ten far larger
surrounding counties. And, just to complicate matters, another eight
counties are considered by the US federal government to be within Atlanta's
metropolitan statistical area.
Each county has its own governmental structure intact and no intentions of
consolidating into a metropolitan government. Instead, Atlanta's various
political entities co-ordinate their policy-making on issues such as water,
transportation and tourism through the Atlanta Regional Commission and, most
importantly, try to speak with one voice for the purpose of drawing outside
investment.
'Co-operation has lessened the need for consolidation,' said Mr Harry West,
the Atlanta Regional Commission's chairman. But the city and the surrounding
county governments compete fiercely for the prizes of economic development.
And political tensions would no doubt be far higher if Atlanta were not the
economic juggernaut that it is.
Over the last few decades, the city has been losing more and more of its
share of incoming investment to the surrounding suburbs. The shift has
occurred over the last 30 years as the predominantly white, middle class
suburbs have vastly grown, leaving the city of Atlanta with a predominantly
black - and relatively poor - population of less than 400,000.
A political change has accompanied the population shift. The city remains a
Democratic party bastion, while the suburbs are increasingly Republican and
conservative. The leading right-wing Republican congressman, Mr Newt
Gingrich, who represents some of Atlanta's northern counties, exemplifies
the suburbs' political tenor.
Yet, despite some erosion of its power, the city's political influence is
still dominant. It continues to be run by a working alliance of the white
business elite and the black politicians who have held control of City Hall
for over 20 years.
The city's mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, still plays the most crucial role in
representing Atlanta. And his is a juggling act, says Prof Crimmins. While
the mayor symbolically represents one of the most prosperous metropolitan
areas in the US, he rules a central city that suffers from all the problems
of crime, crumbling infrastructure, poor schools and insufficient revenues
that besiege most of the big American cities. Fortunately, he seems
especially apt at having a foot in both business and political worlds. A
graduate of Vanderbilt and Duke Universities, two prestigious schools of the
South, and a successful lawyer with a large Atlanta law firm, Mr Campbell is
a generation away from the civil rights struggles that shaped the life of
his parents and their contemporaries.
His two predecessors, Mr Maynard Jackson and Mr Andy Young, who had ruled
City Hall successively from 1973 to 1993, are of the earlier generation.
Both men broke colour barriers for public office. Mr Jackson was Atlanta's
first black mayor, and Mr Young was the first black US Ambassador to the UN.
Mr Campbell's talk now is mostly about 'running city government like a
business,' rather than racial issues. In this sense, he seems a man
well-suited for the fiscally straightened 1990s - 'we have to find ways of
doing things cheaper and with fewer people,' he says. Having only been in
office ten months of his four-year term, Mr Campbell says he has already
shrunk the city's bureaucracy by 400 jobs.
The 1996 Olympics will assist Mr Campbell in dealing with some of the city's
fiscal problems. Additional tax revenues will come in and the lion's share
of Dollars 1.5bn in Olympic investment will be in the central city, helping
to keep unemployment low and improving several of the poorest neighbourhoods
through Olympic-related construction.
Adding to the construction boom, Mr Campbell won voter approval in July for
a Dollars 150m bond issue for much needed city infrastructure improvements.
He says that roughly 30 per cent of the projects, especially those related
to streets, bridges and parks, should be completed by 1996. He also wants to
put more spark in the city's financial management - 'there is vast
creativity in the financial world and we need to be less stodgy,' he says.
One new financial tool that he has heartily supported is the sale of tax
liens to a private collection agency.
Mr Mitch Skandalakis, the chairman of the governing commission of Fulton
County, wherein the City sits and which collects its taxes, initiated the
tax lien measure. Recently approved by the commission, it will bring Dollars
75m immediately into the county's coffers, 20 per cent of which will go to
Atlanta.
Mr Skandalakis, who is running for re-election this month, says that if
re-elected he will restart talks that he began recently with Mr Campbell
about eliminating duplication of services between the city and the county so
that both could save money.
Mr Skandalakis, who is white and conservative, also juggles political and
economic interests, given that his county includes Atlanta and some of the
northern suburbs that want little to do with the city. Despite their
differences, Mr Skandalakis gives the most compelling reason for political
cohesion in metro Atlanta. He says he wants to help Mr Campbell succeed as
mayor 'because if Atlanta fails, the whole area fails.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (1): Bumpy ride to a new identity -
Changes in Australia's ethnic make-up, its international orientation and
economic culture are a test of its political maturity
</HEADLINE>

As political rallies go, the recent gathering in Cabramatta, one of Sydney's
western suburbs, was a low-key affair. A few hundred people, perhaps
two-thirds Vietnamese, gathered in the local park to hear speeches and sing
songs. A solitary policeman tapped his foot in time to the music.
But the fact that it occurred at all was extraordinary. A few days earlier,
the local state MP and an outspoken opponent of Asian gangs who had
infiltrated the area, had been shot dead. While the reasons for his killing
have yet to be revealed, the local media quickly declared this to be
Australia's first political assassination.
The racist tone of subsequent public reaction on radio chat-shows worried
community leaders, and they decided a backlash should be forestalled. The
rally, it was hoped, would demonstrate the area's real feelings.
It would be easy to get Cabramatta out of proportion. In truth, there are
not many streets in Australia where European script is barely visible. The
suburb's electorate is amongst the nation's most diverse, almost one-fifth
Vietnamese, but with other large immigrant communities, drawn from both Asia
and Europe. Australia, meanwhile, remains more remarkable for the
accessibility and informality which surrounds its public figures.
All that said, Cabramatta's recent experience, and the preconceptions and
responses which it unleashed, do highlight the key question which confronts
the nation. For a decade, Australia has been engaged in a process of
fundamental change, encompassing everything from the country's trade focus
and its wage-bargaining mechanisms, to its cultural priorities and racial
mix. Key objectives have been (and remain) a closer integration with Asian
neigbours and a more competitive business environment at home.
But how fast this restructuring can, or should be, pushed is an extremely
difficult issue - and one which gets no easier as the changes dig more
pervasively into everyday lives, and trade-offs between political consensus
and what is optimal from an economic standpoint become inevitable.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, made reference to the issue during his
keynote speech to delegates at the recent Australian Labor Party conference.
'We are in office. We are doing what we do best - which is making the
changes, preparing Australia for the future,' he said.
'And we are bringing the people with us,' he continued in a slight departure
from the prepared text. 'That's the important thing, they're coming with
us.'
From a political perspective, the prime minister's assessment seems correct.
Since winning the supposedly 'unwinnable' election in early 1993, when
recession was biting hard and dissatisfaction rife, the Keating
administration has established a clear lead over its opponents in the
opinion polls.
A Newspoll survey published in late-October, for example, suggested that if
an election were held today, 46 per cent would vote for the Australian Labor
Party versus 41 per cent for the Liberal/National coalition. On polling day
in 1993, the same survey showed the two votes neck-and-neck.
The government's edge does owe something to the leadership turmoil within
the Liberal Party, the larger partner in the coalition, and to the
opposition's policy confusion in the wake of its unexpected 1993 election
loss. Moreover, the ALP's ascendancy in federal politics is not mirrored at
state or territory level, where only Queensland remains in outright Labor
control. This situation, in turn, makes for tension and confusion in key
areas, ranging from Aboriginal rights to labour relations.
But it is also arguable that one major factor in Labor's successful
retention of popular support at federal level has been its astute but
cautious timing of the reform process - a sharp contrast to New Zealand,
whose faster restructuring has provoked a political backlash. In Australia,
where the electorate is generally conservative, the Keating government has
shown a marked willingness to adjust the tempo in sensitive areas, ensuring
that a majority is kept on board.
But while this careful pace of change has so far bought political stability,
it is possible that problems are being created on the economic front.
On a short-term view, there seems little cause for concern. Growth in GDP is
forecast to run out at around 4.5 per cent in 1994/5, and then at perhaps
four per cent in the following year, figures which compare favourably with
any other 'western' economy.
The inflation outlook has begun to look a little less favourable in recent
months, in part because of the potential long-term implications of the
current drought which has crippled key agricultural areas on the east coast.
Nevertheless, the situation is not all that alarming. The consumer price
index is forecast to rise by just 2.1 per cent this year, and perhaps 3.5-4
per cent in the following 12 months. Moreover, a larger-than-anticipated one
percentage point jump in interest rates in late-October suggests that the
Reserve Bank of Australia, the central monetary authority, is firmly
determined to keep price rises under control.
It is over the medium-term that the clouds start to loom. Unemployment has
been slow to fall in Australia, and is expected to average a little under 10
per cent in 1994. The government responded earlier this year with a
comprehensive package of measures, including a promise of subsidised
employment or training for all long-term unemployed. It was costed at
ADollars 6.5bn over the next four years.
But rather than fund the package with new tax measures, which could have
been politically troublesome, ministers chose to utilise the 'growth
dividend' - the higher than expected tax receipts flowing from the country's
rapid economic recovery. That, in turn, meant that there was no scope for
accelerating the government's deficit reduction plan in the 1994 budget,
which repeated the previously-stated aim of cutting this to one per cent of
GDP by 1996-97. More recently, there have been suggestions that fiscal
strategy may be reviewed next year. But analysts are sceptical.
An even larger cloud on the horizon is the current account situation. This
has been a bugbear for Australia in the past, with an upturn in domestic
activity tending to lead to a surge in imports - in part, to meet capital
investment requirements. As the trade balance has gone out of kilter,
interest rates have been forced up, and a 'boom and bust' scenario has
developed.
This time, the anticipatory response has been twofold. There has been an
all-out effort to promote Australian exports, most notably to Asia, which
now accounts for over 60 per cent of the country's trade. And there is an
attempt to lift the country's low saving rate, through changes to the
pension/superannuation system.
It is in the context of the former strategy that Australia's desire to
establish a 'free trade' zone in the Asia-Pacific region assumes
considerable importance. The Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation group is due
to meet this month to consider a report seeking the goal of free trade in
all goods and services by 2020, with more developed nations lowering their
barriers at a relatively faster rate. Australia is expected to push the
proposal hard.
At this stage, it would be a brave individual who tried to predict whether
enough change had been wrought to break the previous cyclical pattern.
Government ministers say yes; some local business leaders, and many Asian
competitors, say no.
'Reviewing the scorecard, I'd give us about five out of 10 for our current
policy mix,' remarked Don Mercer, head of the ANZ banking group, earlier
this year. 'Unless we commit ourselves to picking up the reform agenda, we
stand a pretty good chance of wasting the best opportunity in decades to
secure the sustained recovery we deserve to have'.
Perhaps all that can be said with certainty is that the balancing act is a
delicate one on which political fortunes will undoubtably ride.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Greater Atlanta (1): Where business success is
prized above all - Atlanta has been the leading business city of the
American South for several decades, but it now aspires to even greater
things. The 1996 Olympics are widely believed by Atlantans to be the lever
for catapulting the city to international standing
</HEADLINE>

The essence of other cities may be culture, high finance, beauty or glamour.
But Atlanta has commerce in its heart.
The city prides itself on being a place where people can succeed, and where
business success is prized above all.
'The whole tone of the city is one of aspiration,' says Mr Alf Nucifora, a
top local marketing consultant, who came from Australia some 20 years ago
and rose to prominence.
While dreadfully prone to boosterism, Atlantans say their hometown is
characterised by a 'can do' attitude. Defeatism and 'thinking small' are
anathema here.
Although the heart of Atlanta is business, it is not a city that is money
mad. It is more that Atlantans are single-minded in the pursuit of 'making
it,' whether it be a successful dry cleaning shop or a leading worldwide
television network - CNN.
Atlanta's attitude is perhaps a product of its history. Originally a simple
railway town known as Terminus, it changed its name in 1845 to the
grander-sounding Atlanta.
After being razed by Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman near the end of the
Civil War, it rebuilt itself from the ashes to once again thrive in the late
19th century as a railroad town. Fittingly, Atlanta's symbol is the Phoenix.
Entrepreneurial spirit always seems to have powered the town. In the 1880s,
a shrewd businessman by the name of Asa Candler saw the immense
possibilities of marketing sweet fizzy water and built the foundation of the
Coca Cola empire. Coca Cola's worldwide headquarters remains here today.
It has been the leading business city of the South for several decades, but
it now aspires to more. It wants international status. Although some
snigger, Atlanta wishes to be the 'next great international city,' in the
same league as New York or Los Angeles, London or Rome.
The 1996 Olympics, which will be held here, are widely believed to be the
lever for catapulting the city to international standing. And Atlanta is
putting every ounce of its energy into trying to make the Olympics a
marketing opportunity for the city as well as the state of Georgia, of which
it is the capital.
Since August 1993, the Chamber of Commerce has run an international
advertising campaign using the Olympics to boost the city on CNN
International. The ads are part of a five-year, Dollars 10m-plus marketing
program by the Chamber.
Mr Nucifora is also trying to raise Dollars 5m for another campaign to
market Atlanta in the run-up to the Olympics. He hopes the theme of the new
campaign will replace the old slogan 'The City Too Busy To Hate,' which has
endured since the days of the struggle for civil rights and is now clearly
outdated.
The new slogan will be about aspirations and dreams, a theme endorsed by
nearly 90 per cent of those he has queried.
At the same time, the Governor of Georgia, Mr Zell Miller, has appointed a
group of business leaders to orchestrate a high level, individually
targetted marketing effort called 'Operation Legacy.' It is hosting a series
of invitation-only tours of Atlanta for top companies and individuals which
might invest here. The best prospects will be invited back to attend the
Games.
While not yet of international stature, Atlanta has much to boast about.
Already home to representative offices of more than 730 of the Fortune
1,000, it is consistently rated as one of the most desirable cities in
America in which to relocate a company or start a new business. This year,
Altanta was the winner of the 'Best Cities for Small Business' award by
Entrepreneur Magazine. It also topped the World Trade Magazine's recent list
for the best ten US cities for global companies.
Good location and transportation facilities continue to be Atlanta's main
economic attractions. By air, 80 per cent of the American population can be
reached within two hours. Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, with
over 1,500 daily flights, including some 300 international flights a week,
is rated the world's second busiest. An average of 50m passengers a year
pass through Hartsfield, which has just opened a new international concourse
that can process 6,000 passengers an hour. Although mired presently in
downsizing, Delta, one of America's top three air carriers, calls Atlanta
home and accounts for about 80 per cent of the airport's passenger traffic.
Atlanta is also a leading distribution centre for goods moving over land.
Three interstate highways intersect the city.
For rail distribution, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railroads operate 80 freight
trains in and out of Atlanta daily. Telecoms capacity is high, with more
fibre optic cable laid than any city in the US. BellSouth, one of the
leading Baby Bells, has its headquarters in Atlanta as does Turner
Broadcasting and Turner's worldwide news network CNN.
If short on sophistication, Atlanta's quality of life is high at a modest
cost compared to other large cities. Housing is moderately priced.
Recreational amenities include an ample supply of golf courses, tennis clubs
and city parks. Nearby, Lake Lanier is used for water sports, and the
southernmost Appalachian mountains offer great hiking.
Its attractions have made Atlanta a boom town. The prosperity has lured more
and more people to 'Hotlanta,' as the boosters are fond of calling it.
Between 1984 and 1993, 1,506 new companies, including 361 foreign firms,
have relocated to Atlanta, investing Dollars 80bn and helping to create a
net increase of 487,600 jobs. Between 1980 and 1990, Atlanta's population
grew 32.5 per cent to 2.83m. Last year, an estimated 86,000 people arrived
in metro Atlanta, driving up housing construction by about 40,000 units.
Even with all of the city's appeal and formidable energy, there are still
some who worry that the 1996 Olympics may not bring the glory to Atlanta
that is expected. These sceptics say that the Olympics may prove that
Atlanta lamentably believed its own hype and over-reached itself. A city of
Atlanta's size with a more modest opinion of itself would probably have
never even attempted to lure the Olympic Games. But Atlanta dared and won.
And for the moment, the Dollars 1.5bn worth of Olympic preparations are
reported to be on schedule and on budget.
Perhaps because so many have come here and done well, Atlantans feel a deep
affection for the city. This has in turn led to one of its greatest
distinctions: the business community is perhaps the most civicly active in
America. They not only give money to community causes, they give time and
energy. They chair arts and community development committees, raise money
for charities, clean up public parks, and volunteer for The Atlanta Project,
the local anti-poverty programme of the former US president, Jimmy Carter.
It is a point of pride for business and professional people to be involved
in community affairs. Mr Wyck Knox, a senior partner at the Atlanta law firm
of Kilpatrick &amp; Cody, has civic commitments that require a significant
amount of his time, but he observes: 'People in business and professional
circles are interested in making things happen here.'
He admits civic involvement is also good for business - and he adds that
'it's important in Atlanta to be perceived as doing something useful for the
community.'
Another of Atlanta's distinctions is its ability to maintain racial harmony
when so many other American cities have been riven by racial animosities.
Despite the fact that the central city is predominantly black, while the
larger metro area is predominantly white, Atlanta's black politicians and
white business elite long ago recognised the value of racial harmony for
economic growth.
While all is not sweetness and light between blacks and whites, Atlanta's
mayor, Mr Bill Campbell, who is black, says, that race 'has not been a
hindrance to finding common solutions or trying to work together.'
Black-white relations have been helped by the presence of a very large black
middle class. With the biggest concentration of top black universities in
America and an affluent black business community, Atlanta is considered a
'Mecca' for ambitious young blacks throughout the US.
In addition, as the birthplace of Dr Martin Luther King Jr., Atlanta
proclaims itself the cradle of the civil rights movement. The King Center,
which attracts nearly a million visitors a year, is receiving a face-lift in
anticipation of the Olympics' year.
The 1996 Olympics will allow Atlanta to be on the international stage, at
least temporarily. But whether it stays there will depend on whether it
carries off the event with maturity and aplomb or overdoes its
self-promotion. If it makes the latter mistake, it may simply look
tastelessly opportunistic.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Kwik Save hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stores group Kwik Save slid 9 to 546p as securities houses stressed their
sell stance ahead of figures on Thursday. There is a market consensus for
full-year profits of around Pounds 130m, and Yamaichi's Mr Bill Myers echoed
the thoughts of several when he said many superstore majors now offer what
Kwik Save alone used to offer.
In a sell recommendation which hit client's desks yesterday, Mr Myers said:
'Without a change of strategy, profits are set to plateau at about Pounds
130m for many years.'
J. Sainsbury, which also reveals figures this week, slipped 3 to 398p on
concern over the price fighting among the leading food retailers. Analysts
expect interim profits tomorrow to come in around Pounds 445m.
Calluna, the Scottish-based designer and manufacturer of miniature hard disk
drives, made an impressive stock market debut. The shares, placed at 65p,
and sponsored by Albert E. Sharpe, the Midlands stockbroker, opened at 87p
and raced up to close at 92p, with 9.6m changing hands.
The current vogue for on-market share buybacks continued as Macro 4 shares
moved off their 1994 low point of 423p, closing 11 higher at 434p after the
company instructed its broker SG Warburg to buy in 1.1m shares, or just
under 5 per cent of its issued capital. Just before the close of trading
Macro announced that it had bought in 844,000 shares at 430p apiece.
The market's 100 points-plus upsurge over the past three sessions injected
renewed confidence in the financial sectors, where recently battered
merchant banks and investment management groups attracted keen interest.
Hambros, which followed SG Warburg in announcing a profits warning early
last month, extended Friday's strong performance, closing a further 6 higher
at 234p, while SG Warburg advanced 8 to 614p. Kleinwort Benson rose 7 to
488p and Schroders 25 to 1360p. Edinburgh Fund Managers jumped 14 to 723p,
M&amp;G Group 22 to 955p and Mercury Asset Management 14 to 628p.
Switching out of Abbey National and into TSB, thought to have been triggered
by Credit Lyonnais Laing, saw the latter move ahead 7 to 226p and the former
finish 5 lower at 416p.
The two quoted Premier League football clubs gave good performances on the
stock market as well as on the field. Manchester United moved up 12 to 657p
after closing the gap on the premiership leaders and ahead of their European
Champions League match against Barcelona on Wednesday. Tottenham edged up 6
to 124p.
British Aerospace tumbled 11 to 446p, with one dealer taking the view that
the VSEL bid saga 'is all over bar the shouting; BAe has been outmanoeuvred
by GEC'.
Brewer Whitbread jumped 15 to 172p as some chart-based analysts argued that
the stock had broken through into a new trading range.
Property and shipping company P&amp;O improved 10 to 636p, with dealers
reporting a good two-way pull on the stock ahead of the official opening of
the Channel tunnel. Traders said investment institutions were taking a stand
on the effect that the Channel tunnel would have on ferry traffic and
dealing accordingly.
A certain amount of bear closing saw troubled Channel tunnel group
Eurotunnel bounce 4 to 235p in the Units.
Transport group NFC suffered slightly after it was announced that its former
chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock is suing the company for Pounds 1.3m in
compensation. The issue is unlikely to hit profits but did dent sentiment
and the shares shed 3 1/2 to 178p. NFC also said it was in talks with John
I. Jacobs to sell some of the assets of its BRS car delivery unit. Jacobs
rose 4 to 63p.
Daily Mail and General Trust 'A' fell 30 to 983p after the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission blocked its proposed acquisition of T. Bailey Forman,
publisher of the Nottingham Evening Post.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Demand for Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International conglomerate Hanson was among the most heavily traded stocks
in London as the shares received support from reports of higher commodity
prices.
Analysts said that the price for polyethylene, which is manufactured by
Hanson subsidiary Quantum, had increased by five cents a pound. The
fundamental firmness combined with an increasingly attractive yield has been
encouraging buying interest after a steep slide since the start of the
month. The shares firmed a penny to 231p, with 7.5m traded.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers made rapid progress after an uncertain start. Down to around 164p in
early trading, the shares subsequently began to move ahead on strong support
prompted by a positive circular published by Robert Fleming Securities. They
closed 5 higher at 172p.
Another bull story in Vickers was that the company may conclude a joint
venture with Germany's Daimler-Benz by the end of the year in the
development of new Rolls-Royce cars. Specialists said they expected Daimler
to buy a 20 per cent stake in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars for around Pounds 40m
to Pounds 50m and eventually lift the holding to 49 per cent.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities extend gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Water and electricity issues left the rest of the market far behind as
domestic and overseas institutions chased both sectors, responding to yet
more bullish broker circulars, the prospect of more big special dividends
from the regional electricity companies (recs), and on hopes of bumper
results and dividends from the water stocks.
There was one notable casualty in the recs in Manweb, whose shares, very
strong early in the session, came under pressure following news of the
resignation - 'by mutual agreement' - of its finance director Mr John
Astall.
Other recs, although generally closing below their best levels, still
displayed hefty gains, with those perceived as strong candidates to deliver
special one-off dividends heavily bought. Southern, up 28 at 800p, was seen
as one of the favourites for such a move, as was Eastern, up 30 at 796p.
James Capel was said to have been the latest broker to recommend the water
sector, following last week's positive notes from BZW, UBS and Credit
Lyonnais Laing. Thames Water opens the water sector reporting season this
morning, with the market looking for an interim dividend of at least 8p, a
rise of around 8 per cent. Thames put on 10 1/2 at 532p. Severn Trent jumped
14 to 573p and Southern 12 to 608p.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A healthy premium in stock index futures provided arbitrage opportunities
which tended to set the tone for the day's trading, writes Peter John.
The FT-SE 100 contract expiring in December moved forward sharply in morning
dealing, widening its lead on the underlying cash market to some 26 points.
This compared to a current fair value premium estimated at around nine
points. The sellers moved in and drove the December contract down towards
3,100 shortly before the official 4.10pm close.
However, a last minute scramble sent the contract up to 3,109, a premium of
12 points to cash.
The day's economic statistics - MO money supply and purchasing managers
figures - appeared to have little effect on the market, which was dominated
by technical trading. NatWest Securities and GNI were said to have been keen
buyers, but overall volume was thin in comparison with recent levels and
turnover failed to reach 12,000 lots by the end of the pit-trading session.
Traded options volume was also down from Friday's level, with only 31,215
lots changing hands. Guinness was an active market with 1,895 contracts
traded, but the other leaders - National Power, HSBC, British Steel,
Eastern, Tesco and BP - were significantly below 1,000 contracts.

FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices below the best following
US data - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Economic data from the US dominated the London market yesterday, and
although an attempt was made to break away above the FT-SE 3,100 mark,
shares backed off when Wall Street fell at the opening of the new session.
Once again, trading volume was very thin, causing increased volatility in
London stocks.
The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 13.6 up at 3,097.4, having moved towards
3,100 at the finish as markets steadied after an initially bearish reaction
to rises in the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index and in US personal
incomes, both seen as inflation threatening.
Nervousness over inflationary pressures on interest rates were heightened in
London after the announcement of a 7.3 per cent gain in domestic MO money
supply, and a modest rise in the British Purchasing Managers' prices index
set the scene for further important developments this week.
Today brings publication of the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, and
the monthly meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor
of the Bank of England takes place tomorrow.
Some analysts believe that the chances that UK base rates will be raised
before the end of the year have increased as economic data in the US has
suggested that economic expansion is bringing inflationary pressure in its
train.
However, Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney said he did not believe that
a further policy tightening in the UK 'would be valid' at the moment.
Inflationary pressure, he noted, is coming chiefly through commodity prices,
over which the UK authorities have no control.
Base rate worry cut into UK bond prices and this undermined a brave start by
equities which took the Footsie index to within a few points of 3,100 in
very early deals. The domestic economic data helped to reverse early gains
and push the Footsie briefly into negative territory, taking it down to
3,079.
However, a strong stock index futures market soon took underlying equities
ahead again. By mid-session the market was comfortably through the 3,100
barrier with a gain of nearly 28 points on the Footsie.
The negative reaction from Wall Street and the US bond markets to the
Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index soon undermined markets in Europe, and
the advance in the London market was checked, share prices briefly losing
about one-third of early gains before the Dow Jones Industrial Average
steadied. The Dow index had trimmed its fall to around 8 points when London
closed for the day.
Traders shook their heads over another volatile session which had seen the
market move through a range of more than 30 points, in both plus and minus
trends on the Footsie, yet still brought disappointing turnover.
Seaq volume was down to 486.7m shares from Friday's total which exceeded
500m. Renewed strength in the utility stocks, seen as candidates for further
share buybacks or special dividends, boosted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which
moved forward 15.3 to 3,516.9. But the blue chips, discouraged by the
dollar's lack of vitality, focused around prospects for company trading
news.
Oil shares were strong as higher crude prices and Wall Street's response to
good statements from the US oil majors set the scene for trading results due
this morning from British Petroleum. Shares in BP hit new highs in sterling
and dollar terms yesterday, fuelled by hopes for good news on the dividend
front.
A further easing in the British Aerospace shares, while VSEL remained just
under the GEC offer price, suggested that the market is assuming that GEC
will emerge as the winner from the bid duel.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after Friday's
strong gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices were mostly lower yesterday as equity investors regrouped
after Friday's big gains, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 22.54 down at 3,908.12 after a
wave of program-guided selling brought a sharp fall in the index during the
final hour. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 1.42 at 472.35. Declining
issues were ahead of advances by a slim margin. Activity eased from Friday's
heated pace, although a fairly heavy 303m shares were traded on the NYSE by
the close. In the other leading markets, the American SE composite was 0.41
better at 458.57, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.35 at 777.50.
Early in the day, profit-takers came to the fore on the heels of Friday's
55-point surge by the Dow industrials. Bonds were a little lower, following
a big advance of their own. The day's economic news came in fairly close to
expectations and had little impact on sentiment.
The Commerce Department reported a small increase in personal spending and
income during September, while the Purchasing Management Association of
Chicago said its October index of business activity and the prices-paid
component of its monthly survey had both risen.
Investors took little notice of either development, with attention centred
on today's national survey of purchasing managers and Friday's crucial data
on conditions in the labour market.
Among the Dow components, Philip Morris was marked down Dollars 2 3/4 to
Dollars 61 1/4 . A Florida court ruled in favour of allowing any smoker who
had fallen ill because of nicotine addiction to be included in a
class-action suit against cigarette makers.
Shares in RJR Nabisco, another big tobacco company, eased Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 6 7/8 . Sellers were influenced by the additional news that RJR
planned to divest 19 per cent of its food operations in a stock offering and
would drop its plan to acquire a minority stake in Borden, Dollars  1/4 off
at Dollars 13 1/2 .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Equities in Sao Paulo closed 2.6 per cent down in light trade after higher
nominal interest rates and an 8.56 per cent surge in the basket of basic
consumer goods in October sparked a late sell-off. The Bovespa index receded
1,297 to 47,979. Turnover was RDollars 220.2m (Dollars 260.3m).
Brokers said higher interest rates, combined with worries about inflation,
had prompted domestic and foreign investors to cash in profits after the
market had risen 13.4 per cent over the last four sessions.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Toronto market closed little changed after quiet trading, having failed
to sustain the good rally sparked by Friday's US gross domestic product
report. Declines in North American bond markets yesterday morning helped to
stifle enthusiasm and the TSE 300 composite index ended just 3.03 points
firmer at 4,291.65.
Rising issues narrowly led declines by 415 to 354 after volume of 55.6m
shares.
The golds group had a mixed day, posting a tiny rise in spite of a fall in
the New York spot price for gold of USDollars 3.70 to USDollars 383.75 an
ounce. The group was buoyed by American Barrick, which gained CDollars  5/8
at CDollars 32 1/4 after reporting generally solid third-quarter earnings
figures.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ambroveneto up 9.7% more on
bid talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's downswing in US sentiment, weighing upon the New York morning,
was manifest in the European afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN continued to feature bid activity and speculation in banks, while the
strength of Fiat also contributed to a 11.22 or 1.8 per cent rise in the
Comit index to 635.43.
Traders commented that volume held up surprisingly well at around the recent
depressed daily average of L500bn with banks closed by a strike for much of
the day and ahead of today's public holiday.
Ambroveneto, rumoured as a bid target, advanced a further L462 or 9.7 per
cent to L5,236, taking its surge over the last three sessions to 34 per
cent. BCI, thought to be a possible suitor, gained L94 or 2.7 per cent at
L3,556.
Credito Romagnolo picked up L71 to L16,949, off a high of L17,400, but still
short of the L19,000 price offered by Credito Italiano. Credito rose L35 or
2.2 per cent to L1,640.
Fiat put in a solid performance, climbing L59 to L6,283 on renewed buying by
Italian funds. Ferruzzi added L60 or 4.9 per cent at L1,293, with investors
who had sold the stock at higher prices said to be returning as buyers.
FRANKFURT offered apparent gains on the session, but these mostly reflected
last Friday afternoon, when a higher dollar, rising bond prices and an
ebullient Wall Street made their mark in Europe; yesterday the Dax index
closed the official session at 2,071.63, up 31.31, of which 27.12 points
were gained on Friday.
Later indications were more subdued. The Ibis indicated Dax ended 3.28 lower
at 2,061.58, with individual features few and far between. Turnover rose
from DM5.4bn to DM5.6bn.
However, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf produced his monthly
review of the Dax and its constituents, which included a couple of hopeful
pointers in yesterday's uncertain times:
first, while there were some almost superstitious worries about the month of
October, the Dax did better than many expected last month, with a 3 per cent
gain against a 9.1 per cent fall in September; and
second, the presence of three banks, Deutsche, Bayernverein and Bayernhypo,
in the top five Dax performers in October could suggest that the bond market
is over the worst - although Mr Frahm was cautious about this, with US
elections coming up.
ZURICH put in another firm performance, with dollar sensitive issues leading
the way, and the SMI index finished 16.0 ahead at 2,506.5 but off a day's
high of 2,521.6.
Among the dollar earners, Roche certificates gained SFr125 at SFr5,585.
Surveillance surged SFr120 or 7.1 per cent to SFr1,820 while Holderbank and
Nestle each improved SFr20 to SFr969 and SFr1,174 respectively.
In the banking sector, UBS bearers fell SFr23 to SFr1,177 as investors
continued to switch out of the stock ahead of the extraordinary shareholders
meeting on November 22. The bank's statement that unfavourable market
conditions would cause this year's earnings to fall short of the 1993 level
came after the market closed. CS Holding, a beneficiary of switching out of
UBS, gained SFr8 to SFr549.
Among firm insurers, Zurich rose SFr10 to SFr1,145 and Winterthur added SFr4
to SFr638 francs ahead of Thursday's news conference.
AMSTERDAM climbed as investors awaited third quarter results from a number
of major Dutch companies later in the week. The AEX index gained 3.57 to
412.62, after 415.35.
The market was also supported by strength in the dollar and in bonds,
although there was a slight sell off when Wall Street opened down.
Philips was among the day's gainers, up Fl 1.70 or 3.1 per cent to Fl 55.80
ahead of its third quarter results which are due on Thursday. The figures
are expected to show that the electronics group is making substantial
progress in its return to financial health.
DSM, which opens the reporting season today, went against the trend, off Fl
1.80 to Fl 146.00 as profits were taken following strong gains in the past
week. Analysts expected the chemicals group to return a profit of around Fl
102m, against a net loss of Fl 52m in the same 1993 period.
Akzo Nobel, which reports tomorrow, moved ahead Fl 2.60 to Fl 212.90.
MADRID managed to report a gain in spite of renewed bond market weakness.
The general index rose 0.97 to 296.30 as the domestic December bond future
fell 50 basis points to 86.75.
Turnover was thin ahead of today's holiday, at Pta18.8bn. Repsol was the big
blue chip winner with a rise of Pta50 to Pta4,005, off an intraday high of
Pta4,070. The oil company is expected to release third quarter results soon.
Constructions, weak last week, recovered with Cubiertas Pta120 higher at
Pta8,050 and FCC up Pta150 at Pta12,600. In retailers, Cortefiel rose Pta120
to Pta4,480 on first half results which showed net profits up 7.6 per cent.
STOCKHOLM enjoyed a broad rally led by the pharmaceutical group, Astra, and
the engineer, Asea. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 13.2 to 1,485.0
with Astra A up SKr5.50 at SKr194.50 and Asea, which owns 50 per cent of the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, up SKr7 to SKr522 in
a rebound after recent losses.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds lose nearly 3%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Weakness in the price of gold bullion, which hit a low of about Dollars 382
an ounce in London trading during the session, made its effect felt on the
Johannesburg gold shares index, which dropped by nearly 3 per cent.
Dealers remarked that hopes that gold would attain the Dollars 400 level,
which had been supporting prices during late September and early October,
had receded, thereby resulting in heavy selling.
The golds index closed 67 down at 2,224, with sellers also coming into the
market after the release of US consumer expenditure data which showed a
smaller than expected September rise.
The industrials index was affected by the fall in gold, but managed to
regain positive territory by the close, adding 6 at 6,604. The overall index
slipped 27 to 5,723.
Since reaching a year's high of 2,535 at the start of September, the golds
index has fallen by 12 per cent, but remains 2.7 per cent up from its
position at the beginning of January.
Among the day's movers, Driefontein, the gold miner, slipped R2.75 to R64,
while Western Deep declined R10 to R214. Gencor ended 25 cents off at
R14.75.
De Beers, which said it was increasing investment in Tanzania through its
Willcroft subsidiary company, relinquished R2 at R98.55.
Vaal Reefs finished R12 down at R416, while Freegold retreated R2 to R68 and
Loraine softened 25 cents to R19.50.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei higher as Hong
Kong sees 2.8% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An easing of selling pressure on Japan Tobacco, whose unsuccessful listing
last week eroded confidence, encouraged buying by overseas and institutional
investors and the Nikkei 225 average gained ground, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The index closed 184.44 higher at 19,989.60, rising for the fourth
consecutive day. It fluctuated between 20,000.70 and 19,855.47, with trading
by securities dealers also lifting activity.
Volume totalled 245m shares, against 251m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks gained 17.34 at 1,584.66, while the Nikkei 300 put on 3.71 at
290.50. Rises outnumbered falls by 776 to 198, with 172 issues unchanged.
But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 1.38 easier at 1,305.46.
The advance on Wall Street on Friday encouraged futures trading which, in
turn, prompted arbitrage buyers. Overseas investors, followed by domestic
institutions, bought large-capitalisation stocks, including steels and
shipbuilders on hopes of a worldwide recovery in steel demand.
Over the next few weeks the market is expected to focus on interim earnings
announcements and forecasts for the full year. However, some analysts did
not think that profit increases would lift share prices for the time being.
Traders also said potential sellers around the 20,000 Nikkei 225 level were
expected to cap a rise in shares.
Steel companies led activity. Nippon Steel rose Y4 to Y400 and NKK by Y2 to
Y299. Shipbuilders were also traded, with Hitachi Zosen up Y13 to Y567 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries by Y14 to Y789.
Japan Tobacco, which declined sharply following its listing last week,
rallied Y20,000 to Y1.08m, while other privatisation issues were also firm,
with East Japan Railway up Y1,000 to Y483,000 and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone gaining Y15,000 at Y905,000.
Japan Telecom, the long distance telecommunications operator, fell Y60,000
to a new low for the year of Y3.54m on profit-taking. Kyushu Matsushita
Electric, an affiliate of Matsushita Electronics Industrial, shed Y400 to
Y2,440: investors were discouraged by a 61 per cent fall in interim pre-tax
profits and the forecast of a 40 per cent earnings decline for the full
year.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 165.79 to 22,094.95.
Roundup
Friday's rally on Wall Street provided a lead for some Pacific Rim markets.
Taiwan and Manila were closed.
HONG KONG followed Wall Street and saw a flood of pent-up demand drive the
market ahead by 2.8 per cent, its biggest one-day rally since August 30. The
Hang Seng index rose 266.78 to 9,646.25 in a broadly based rally led by
recent laggards.
The mood was also boosted by growing expectations that Britain and China
were close to a deal on the financing for Hong Kong's new airport, which
took HSBC Holdings up HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 91.50.
BANGKOK finished 1.5 per cent higher amid demand for building material and
property development shares, ahead of the launch of a Bt5bn mutual fund to
invest in these sectors.
The SET index closed at the day's high, up 22.71 at 1,528.83, in heavy
turnover of Bt9.1bn.
SEOUL was higher in active trading after wide fluctuations on the back of
renewed buying interest in securities houses and lower-priced manufacturing
shares. The composite index closed 7.36 ahead at 1,105.62, having hit a
day's high of 1,115.48. Volume, at 55.9m shares, was sharply up from
Friday's 47m.
Securities shares with good earnings forecasts found demand. Ssangyong
Investment and Hanshin rose Won1,000 each to go limit-up at Won25,300 and
Won21,000 respectively.
SYDNEY finished higher, taking its lead from foreign markets, but the market
remained overshadowed by today's domestic balance of payments data.
Volume was thin at 138.9m shares as the All Ordinaries index closed 23.6 or
1.2 per cent up at 2,044.8.
Finance stocks met healthy buying. The four major banks all finished higher,
with investors buying in anticipation of strong final result announcements
shortly. ANZ rose 10 cents to ADollars 3.90 and Westpac 8 cents to ADollars
4.53.
WELLINGTON was modestly firmer after a number of leading stocks went
ex-dividend, putting a restraining influence on the main index. The NZSE-40
Capital index, which does not adjust for ex-dividends, ended 5.21 higher at
2,100.37, while the NZSE-40 Gross index, which does adjust, put on 23.35 at
2,560.78 in turnover of NZDollars 38.2m.
KUALA LUMPUR's early gains were cut short as investors largely ignored the
1995 budget, announced last Friday, and prices put under more pressure by
bouts of forced selling by clients unable to meet margin calls.
The composite index ended 4.19 off at 1,108.85 after hitting an early high
of 1,122.72.
SINGAPORE saw property and finance issues make the most headway, while
Malaysian stocks were lower, again on forced selling. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 16.57 to 2,379.03.
JAKARTA held on to early gains at the close on the back of brisk foreign
buying and a firmer Indosat price. The official index ended 7.09 higher at
523.49. Indosat's strong performance in New York was reflected in the
domestic market, with its price rising another Rp125 to Rp8,650.
COLOMBO edged ahead on domestic buying, but turnover of SLRs30.8m was at its
lowest level this year on poor foreign demand. The All-share index gained
3.33 at 1,093.65.
SHANGHAI's A share index fell 4.7 per cent, but was off its lows after the
exchange president reiterrated July's commitment to introduce market
boosting measures. The index lost 32.78 at 668.63 in very thin turnover of
Yn1.4bn.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: FT-Actuaries World Indices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Apparent variations in the European response to the US upward lead last week
include a 2.75 per cent gain in France, according to the FT-Actuaries World
Indices, set against one of just 0.52 per cent in Germany. However, Mr Jerry
Evans, European strategist at Kleinwort Benson, points out that measuring
both over the week to late Friday afternoon wipes out most of the deficit.
Italy's gain, he says, reflects two prior weeks of underperformance, and
speculative excitement about corporate stories and rumours against a
background of low volume. Denmark, in contrast, fell after outperformance in
the week before, and Switzerland slid mostly on worries about the dollar and
its currency translation effect on earnings of the big Swiss internationals.
The week's worst performer was Mexico, depressed by earnings below
expectations at Telmex, the country's largest private company.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Sterling gains ground on interest rate
speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling rose on the markets yesterday as speculation about an increase in
interest rates intensified, writes Philip Gawith.
The trade weighted sterling index finished at 81, its highest level since
the beginning of March, but still below a peak for the year of around 83
reached in January. The pound ended in London at DM2.4583 against the
D-Mark, from DM2.4505, and at Dollars 1.6306, from Dollars 1.6235, against
the dollar.
Attention today will focus on the Bank of England's quarterly bulletin, and
the inflation report, whose publication will provide the background to
tomorrow's monetary meeting.
Market activity was generally quiet yesterday, and this will continue today
with a number of European markets closed for All Saints Day.
The dollar had a fairly quiet day, the market showing little inclination to
build on Friday's rally. It closed at DM1.5077 from DM1.5094 and at Y96.95
from Y97.335. It ended in New York at DM1.5033 and Y96.90.
The D-Mark had a quiet session in Europe. The Swedish krona eased to
SKr4.780/DM from SKr4.759 following an announcement from Moody's, the rating
agency, that it would be reviewing the status of Sweden's sovereign debt.
Speculation about higher UK rates was fuelled by the October M0 money supply
figure, which rose by 7.3 per cent year-on-year. This was higher than market
expectations, well above the monitoring range of zero to 4 per cent, and the
fastest annual rate of growth since January 1989.
To some extent, though, market expectations of higher rates possibly being
sanctioned at the monthly meeting also reflect a newfound credibility in UK
monetary policy. Underlying inflation, at 2 per cent in September, is at its
lowest for 27 years.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe,
commented: 'The Bank of England has managed to build credibility so that the
market now believes the government is inclined to act pre-emptively. There
is a belief that the monetary regime has now changed. The UK is now acting
more like a European country.'
The December short sterling contract closed at 93.50 yesterday, showing that
the market expects UK interest rates to rise to 6.5 per cent by the end of
the year. Three-month LIBOR is currently at 6 1/16 per cent, up from 6 per
cent.
Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at broker GNI, said the firmer cash rates
reflected both a month-end squeeze, and press speculation about the prospect
of higher rates. 'There has been a shift in sentiment from the possibility
to the proba-bility of a rise in rates.'
While most economists are now predicting a further rise in rates by the end
of the year, it is still only a minority who are expecting this to follow in
the immediate aftermath of tomorrow's monetary meeting. Many analysts argue
that, with the chancellor probably undecided about the extent of tax changes
in this month's budget, it would be wise to leave any monetary policy
changes until the December meeting.
Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, last week lent some
support to those arguing against a precipitate move. He said bond markets
were exaggerating the inflationary threat.
In a speech in Birmingham, he added: 'There are relatively few immediate
signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly.' Contributing to the
governor's optimism about the inflation outlook will have been sterling's
recent strength, putting downward pressure on imported inflation. The trade
weighted index has risen from a low of around 78, in mid-August, to 81 now.
On the other hand, the possibility that market expectations might hasten the
next rate increase was highlighted by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
during the September monthly meeting. He said: 'Financial markets were
expecting interest rates to be raised sooner rather than later. If those
expectations were not realised, the markets could become more volatile and
the eventual rise in rates might need to be larger.'
Although the timing of a rise in rates is in dispute, there is a measure of
agreement that the likely trajectory of UK rates will be gradually upwards,
rather than sharply, as often in the past. Mr Persaud said the good
behaviour of the current account, and inflation, during the present recovery
'would allow rates to peak at a much lower level than before'.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.321bn
assistance, including Pounds 355m of late support, after forecasting a
Pounds 1.4bn daily shortage.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: N American wood-pulp prices
raised again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Several North American wood-pulp producers have announced their fifth price
rise of the year to levels that are roughly double those at the bottom of
the cycle in mid-1993.
The producers plan to raise the price of northern bleached softwood kraft
pulp, the industry's benchmark product, by USDollars 50 to Dollars 750 a
tonne on January 1. The increase, if successful, will bring prices to within
striking distance of the record Dollars 840 reached in 1989.
The world pulp market has been buoyed by a strong rise in paper consumption,
especially in Europe and South-east Asia, and by fears of a strike at pulp
and paper mills in British Columbia. Demand is so strong that many North
American producers are unable to meet their customers' full requirements.
World-wide producer stocks have fallen by almost half from the peak reached
last year.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian pulp mills
operated at 96 per cent of capacity during the first nine months of this
year, up from 85 per cent in 1993. Shipments of market pulp to western
Europe climbed by 21 per cent, to Japan by 39 per cent and to the rest of
Asia and Africa by 49 per cent.
Analysts are divided on whether and for how long the price surge will
continue. Mr Chip Dillon of Salomon Brothers in New York recently forecast
that NBSK prices would peak at Dollars 860 a tonne in 1997. Like many other
market watchers, however, Mr Dillon predicts a correction in early 1995,
reflecting the start-up of two large new mills in Indonesia and a slowdown
in the stocks build-up.
The unexpectedly steep climb in pulp prices last week led Kimberly-Clark,
the Dallas-based papermaker, to cancel a plan to spin off its pulp mills in
Ontario and Alabama into a new public company.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG miner expects Lihir gold
lease soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Niugini Mining, the Papua New Guinea-based company which is controlled by
Canada's Battle Mountain Gold, said yesterday that it expected the crucial
'special mining lease' which would allow the ADollars 1bn-plus development
of the Lihir gold mine to go ahead, to be issued before the end of the year.
The Lihir project, which is joint venture between Britain's RTZ and Niugini
Mining and would become one of the world's largest gold mines outside of
South Africa, has been clouded by uncertainly for the best part of a year as
the PNG government has debated the project's structure, and tried to
determine what stake local landowners should be given.
A break-through came in August, when Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's former prime
minister, was replaced by Sir Julius Chan, who quickly indicated that
priority would be given to resolving the situation. However, Niugini
Mining's statement yesterday - part of its quarterly operations report - was
the firmest indication of the timetable now expected.
Niugini Mining said that the landowners' stake in the project would be met
from the PNG government's share, which would be pegged at 30 per cent as
originally planned. 'Landowners are expected to respond to a government
proposal concerning landowner equity in late-October,' it said.
Financing for the project is expected to comprise a mix of debt and equity -
again, in line with the original scheme. Niugini Mining said work on the
equity issue, halted earlier this year, had recommenced.

An an unusually long London fixing session ended with the price at Dollars

FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee recovery falls short of
bonanza for Colombia - Improved returns will allow farmers to repay loans
and renew plantations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High coffee prices are bringing relief and recovery but it is too soon to
talk about a bonanza, according to Colombian coffee growers.
Just as the National Coffee Fund will be able to pay off debts and move into
the black, so too the farmers are planning to repay loans and renew
plantations as they gather in the main harvest.
'Many of the farms here are in a poor state,' says Mr Alberto Restrepo,
director of the Risaralda coffee growers' committee. 'But the small farmers,
who make up 80 per cent of the producers in Risaralda, were not so badly
affected by the crisis because they supply their own labour and grow their
own food. Even so, the growers should be getting a bigger share of the
international price so that production can recover quickly.'
The support price paid to coffee growers in Colombia has been increasing
steadily and now stands at the equivalent of about USDollars 1.10 a pound.
It is the most important of several instruments used by the government and
the coffee growers' federation, Federacafe, to control production and
protect farmers from the ups and downs of the international market. If the
support price is too generous it can start another cycle leading to
over-production.
Colombia's 1993-94 coffee harvest is estimated at 11.6m bags (60kg each),
probably rising to 12.3m bags in 1994-95. Compared with the 1991-92 peak of
more than 17m bags, these figures are low, largely because of the spread of
broca disease, a low rate of plantation renewal and minimal use of
fertiliser. About 50,000 hectares out of the total 1.1m devoted to coffee in
Colombia have also been eradicated over the last two years.
However, some farmers have kept their plantations in good order. Luis
Alberto Arcila, who has 3.5 ha under coffee on steep hillsides in Risaralda,
co-ordinates one of the Federacafe farmers' groups in his area and has been
learning how to live with broca, applying insecticide and a fungus he
himself prepares.
The broca insect enters the coffee cherry about 100 days after flowering; in
Colombia the plants flower so often that the producer has to pick the fruit
constantly through the year to prevent broca infestation and this puts his
costs up by about 8 per cent. Mr Arcila says that only 3 per cent of his
coffee is affected by broca. Despite Federacafe's intensive education
efforts, many farmers are less careful and some 10 per cent of Risaralda's
crop is damaged.
'Now the price is better I'm working with more spirit. Last year I cleared
one lot of coffee plants but I couldn't renew them because of the economic
situation. With this harvest I can pay my debts and put something back into
the farm,' says Mr Arcila.
Although the previous two years were particularly lean ones for Colombia's
300,000 coffee producers, decades of investment in roads, electricity and
social welfare programmes have given the coffee growing region a relatively
high standard of living and low level of violence.
Now Federacafe is introducing 'greener' methods using far less water for the
de-pulping process and, instead of tipping the pulp on to valley slopes
where it will contaminate streams, farmers are mixing it with other organic
rubbish and worms to make rich humus.
'We're reforesting to protect the springs and watersheds. The only thing to
do about the water problem is to educate, educate, educate,' says Mr
Restrepo.
'The spending cuts affected infrastructure projects but not the technical
assistance programmes. The small grower here is technified and very
receptive to new things like fish breeding ponds, rabbits, worms -
everything.'
Colombia's 1994 coffee income is forecast at over USDollars 1.7bn, compared
with USDollars 1.2bn in 1993. Even the most conservative estimates suggest
that next year's earnings will be above USDollars 2 bn, which means that
USDollars 600m or more can be saved abroad for difficult times.
Over the past five years Federacafe has slashed all budgets, nearly halved
its staff and cut marketing costs. As a result the federation - which
handles about half the country's exports on average - is now as efficient as
the private exporting companies.
The special commission set up to study Colombia's coffee sector recommended
earlier this year that Federacafe should not play such a big part in
exports. 'The federation thinks that it's not possible to divorce marketing
from stability; the commission wants to keep the domestic support price
system in place, so we need a cash flow to maintain stocks and so on,' says
Mr Diego Pizano at Federacafe. 'Missions from other producer countries have
been coming to see how the Colombian model works. By managing three
variables - support pice, credit and technical assistance - we have control
over the production level.'
Production is well below the ideal level of 15m bags defined by the
commission, but should reach this in 1996-97. With suppliers agreements
covering over 13m bags and domestic consumption of about 1.5m bags, the 15m
target is realistic, says Mr Pizano. But if prices drop again in two years'
time and the revaluation of the peso continues, there could come a moment
when Colombia's ability to compete will be seriously undermined.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Landed teas met good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Assams came to a firm market apart from plainest sorts. Brightest Kenya and
Burundi teas sold well at fully firm to dearer rates, particularly pd's.
Below best sorts and coloury mediums were irregular and barely steady.
Ceylons met improved demand with brighter bop's selling well at dearer
rates. Other sorts were irregularly easier. Offshore: good demand with
brighter teas fully firm. Plain Ugandas were unwanted. Quotations: best
available 200p/kg, good 140p/kg, good medium 120p/kg, medium 110p/kg, low
medium 88p/kg. The highest price realised this week was a 205p/kg for an
Assam pf.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US plans food aid for former
Soviet bread basket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US hopes to sign an agreement to provide Ukraine, once the Soviet bread
basket, with Dollars 20m in food aid as a safety net in its transition to a
market economy.
Mr August Schumacher, head of the US Department of Agriculture's foreign
agricultural service, said in London yesterday that the aim was to avoid
food shortages in the cities as agricultural reforms took effect. The
agreement is expected to be signed when President Leonid Kuchma visits
Washington at the end of this month. 'We're exploring with Ukraine whether
more will be needed, and we're hoping Europe will also be able to help,'
said Mr Schumacher, who spent last weekend in talks in Kiev.
He said the aid would be part of the World Bank/International Monetary Fund
stabilisation programme for Ukraine. It was vital that Ukraine, with 53m
people, should have fertiliser and seeds for spring wheat planting next year
and foreign exchange to buy harvesting machinery and spare parts.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury prices fall back on
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bond prices fell victim to profit-taking yesterday as traders
showed a muted reaction to the first in a series of important economic
reports due out this week.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/8 lower at
94 23/32 , with the yield rising to 7.959 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 6.824 per cent.
After the market rang up solid gains on Friday, prices receded in early
trading yesterday. With the long bond jumping by about a point to close last
week's action, traders prudently decided to step back a little.
In spite of the retrenchment, the positive mood appeared to hold. Last
week's shift in sentiment suggested that the market may have touched bottom
before Friday's disclosure that the economy had expanded at an annualised
rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, much stronger than analysts had
forecast.
Although the headline figure could well have rattled the inflation-sensitive
long end, bonds held steady on Friday and then climbed on relief over the
initial calm reaction. During the session, the yield slumped below 8.00 per
cent, an important psychological mark breached a week earlier.
Yesterday, however, traders were looking ahead for fresh guidance. The first
piece of news in this week's busy schedule came at mid-morning.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago announced slight gains in
both its October index of business activity and the prices-paid component of
the monthly survey. The mildly unfavourable developments had little impact,
however.
Instead, attention was directed at today's national survey of purchasing
managers and Friday's crucial report on conditions in the labour market. In
general, the reports were expected to be benign for bonds.
European government bonds drifted lower in moderate volume, dragged down by
weaker US Treasuries. With France closed for the day and market participants
in other countries winding down for today's All Saints' holiday, flows were
thin and dealers reported little investor activity.
After opening on a stronger note, German bunds ended the day nearly 1/2
point lower, slipping on a bout of futures selling which pushed the December
bund futures contract on Liffe as low as 98.08, down 0.41 on the day and
close to the 89.00 level considered to represent key technical support.
The slippage was attributed to the weakness of US Treasuries and to dealers
paring back long futures positions established last week.
Adding to the softer tone was the Bundesbank's announcement that it plans to
issue a new 10-year bund on November 8 and 9. After its recent floating-rate
issue, it has returned to its more traditional fixed-rate bonds.
UK gilts also slipped in light trading, shedding some of the gains posted on
Friday. Weakness in neighbouring bond markets and slightly stronger than
expected money supply data fuelled the profit-taking, which pushed the
December long gilt futures contract down  13/32 to 100 9/16 .
The short end of the yield curve came under particular pressure from
reviving talk of an imminent increase in base rates.
Interest rate jitters have turned the market's focus to today's release of
the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report and tomorrow's meeting
between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. The December short sterling futures
contract fell 0.11 to 93.47.
Swedish bonds opened lower after Moody's Investors Service, the
international rating agency, said late on Friday that it was placing
Sweden's foreign currency debt on review for downgrading on concerns about
the country's public-sector deficit.
However, with few foreign investors left in the Swedish market and domestic
investors reluctant to sell, prices held up relatively well and ended the
day only slightly lower.
The market remains partially underpinned by widespread hopes for a 'yes'
vote in the European Union referendum on November 13.
Moreover, Moody's threat to downgrade Swedish debt may serve Finance
Minister Goran Persson as a tool to help push budget cuts through parliament
in January, observers said.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Bonds: NTT finds strong UK demand for Dollars
300m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone yesterday launched a Dollars 300m
offering of five-year bonds priced to yield 24 basis points over US
government bonds.
The deal, NTT's first offering in the dollar sector for almost two years,
met strongest demand from UK institutional investors, joint lead manager JP
Morgan said. Bonds were also sold to Japanese accounts in London,
non-Japanese buyers in the Far East and investors in Switzerland and
Germany, JP Morgan said.
The offering, which was believed to have been swapped into fixed-rate yen,
was well received by other syndicate managers, who said the bonds were
fairly priced.
One syndicate manager in London said: 'The bonds could have been priced
slightly tighter than they were but to get deals away at the moment you have
to make sure they are priced attractively.'
Recent five-year offerings by Triple A credits like Japan Development Bank
and Oesterreichische Kontrollbank are now trading at around 20 basis points
above US Treasuries, which makes the NTT bonds attractive to investors on a
yield basis, JP Morgan said.
The launch spread was maintained after the bonds were freed to trade. JP
Morgan said that the offering was one of only a few recent dollar deals in
which the pricing spread has not widened out immediately after being
launched.
Interest in the US dollar sector has picked up recently, particularly from
institutional investors in the Far East, and spreads in the dollar secondary
market have tightened, traders said.
In the D-Mark sector, Ford Credit Europe launched a DM200m offering of
five-year bonds targeted at retail investors.
The bonds were priced to yield 45 basis points over the equivalent German
government bonds and the proceeds were believed to have been swapped into
floating-rate D-Mark. The spread widened slightly to around 49 basis points
over after the bonds were freed to trade.
The offering was launched following the success of a similar issue by BMW in
September, lead manager Dresdner Bank said.
The prospects for the D-Mark sector are encouraging, one trader said. Retail
investors, in particular, are being attracted by the relatively high yields
and current low German inflation rate, he said.
The yen sector saw two new bond issues, targeted almost exclusively at
institutional investors in Japan, including a Y30bn offering of bonds due
February 2000 by Santander International.

Merrill Lynch has set up a joint venture with Indonesia's PT Persada Kian

office in Jakarta.
'We have clearly identified Indonesia as probably one of the best
opportunities in the world, if not the best opportunity, for our industry,'
said Mr David Komansky, executive vice-president of Merrill Lynch.
The office will deal with corporate finance, trading, underwriting, asset
management and research and will be headed by Mr Mitchell Shivers, who is
moving from Merrill Lynch's New York office.
Merrill Lynch will own 80 per cent of PT Merrill Lynch Indonesia while the
Indonesian company will own the remaining 20 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first flotation of part of Thailand's electricity industry has attracted
funds worth nearly Dollars 8bn - driving the offer price of the Electricity
Generation Co (Egco) to Bt22 a share.
'It's getting to be quite unbelievable - we knew the share would be popular
but this has surprised us,' said a member of the Jardine Fleming team
co-managing the offer.
The indicated price range had been Bt17 - Bt20 but this was lifted because
the local portion of the offer - a total of 147m shares - was oversubscribed
at least 50 times and the international tranche of the remaining 57m shares
oversubscribed more than 20 times.
At Bt22 a share Egco's market capitalisation is nearly Bt9bn.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHP cuts ties with Woodside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest company, yesterday cut its ties
with Woodside Petroleum, the energy group which is the leading participant
and operator of the North West Shelf gas project, through an institutional
placing of its remaining share interests in the company.
Late yesterday, BHP announced that it had sold the 28.3m shares in Woodside
which it owned directly at ADollars 4.765 each, raising ADollars 135m
(USDollars 100m). It also said that a further 76.8m shares owned by North
West Shelf Development, a joint venture company held equally by BHP and
Shell Australia, had been offloaded.
The second tranche of shares was disposed of at the same price, raising
ADollars 366m in total. Shell said the latter sale did not affect its
'long-term commitment to Woodside', in which it still holds a 34.27 per cent
interest, and to the North West Shelf project.
BHP also said it retained some links to the North West Shelf project through
a 16.67 per cent interest in the LNG export project, and a 8.33 per cent
share in the domestic gas phase. The BHP-related shares were sold to Were
Stockbroking, which planned to place them with a range of institutional and
portfolio investors.
Woodside shares closed 7 cents higher at ADollars 5.02 on the Australian
Stock Exchange yesterday. BHP shares gained 12 cents to A420.64.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Cautious nod for News Corp stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Stock Exchange's indexation department yesterday gave only a
qualified nod to the new preferred limited voting ordinary shares which Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation plans to issue this month.
It said it would include the shares in the calculation of Australia's
All-Ordinaries index, the stock market's main marker, for at least three
months, but review the situation after that initial period.
If the new shares were well-traded and performed in line with the existing
ordinary shares, they would remain in the index. If they traded in
significantly different fashion, however, they would be removed.
The shares are being issued by way of a one-for-two scrip issue, and it is
expected that trading will start on Thursday.
News Corp's decision to issue the limited voting shares has been the focus
of much attention because of Mr Murdoch's apparent desire to raise new
capital without diluting his family's control of the company any further.
If investors can be persuaded that the limited voting shares are roughly
equivalent to the existing ordinary shares, News Corp would be able issue
more of this class of stock without undermining the Murdoch voting position
 -except in a very limited range of circumstances.
Last month, in a move designed to appeal to investors, News Corp announced
that it would amend its articles at a future extraordinary meeting, so that
the limited voting shares are promised a dividend premium of not less than
20 per cent over the dividend on the ordinary shares, and are ensured
similar treatment as the ordinary shares in the event of a bid for News
Corp.
Nevertheless, some sceptics still believe that the limited voting shares
will trade at a discount to the existing ordinary stock.

Shiseido

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new smudge-free lipstick has made an impression on profits at Shiseido,
with the leading Japanese cosmetics manufacturer posting a moderate rise in
interim recurring profits.
Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax -
for the first half rose 0.9 per cent to Y15.9bn (USDollars 163m), while
overall sales edged down 1.5 per cent to Y196.8bn due to a sharp decline in
sanitary products sales. After-tax profits advanced 1 per cent to Y7.8bn.
Sales of Shiseido's new lipstick line, launched in July, totalled a record
2.3m units in the first two months, helping sales of the company's
cosmetic's division rise 1.5 per cent to Y140.7bn. Revenue from its beauty
salons, foods and drugs division fell 1.8 per cent to Y12.8bn.
For the full year to next March, Shiseido expects parent recurring profits
to rise 0.2 per cent to Y32.5bn, and sales to increase 0.2 per cent to
Y392bn.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's leading paper manufacturers continued to suffer from cuts in paper
prices due to stagnant demand, but restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at
the top two companies lifted earnings at the current level.
Benefits from mergers boosted interim profits at Nippon Paper Industries and
New Oji Paper.
New Oji was created through a merger between Oji Paper and Kanzaki Paper in
October last year, while Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp merged to form
Nippon Paper in April last year.
Earnings were also helped by a fall in import raw material costs due to the
strong yen. Sales for the industry declined in spite of a rise in sales
volumes due to sluggish product prices.
Nippon Paper, however, said unconsolidated after-tax profits fell 26 per
cent to Y4bn (Dollars 41.1m) as income from securities sales fell to Y300m.
Daishowa Paper, which is currently undergoing financial restructuring from
the mounting losses on stock and real estate investments, managed to reduce
losses at the recurring level - before extraordinary items and tax - from
Y11.4bn last year.
It reduced operating costs by Y2bn for the first half and cut interest
bearing debts by Y11.5bn from last March to Y423.1bn.
Honshu Paper blamed its profits decline on falling paperboard prices.
After-tax profits, however, rose 2.6 per cent to Y1.4bn due to a fall in
depreciation costs.
For the full year to next March, the companies are expected to see a rise in
sales in tandem with the rise in industrial production and hikes of paper
prices.
Nippon Paper revised up its unconsolidated earnings forecast for the full
year and now expects a 21 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y11.5bn on a
2.1 per cent increase in sales to Y640bn.
New Oji expects a 43.8 per cent rise in recurring earnings to Y15.1bn on a
12 per cent sales increase to Y545.3bn, while Daishowa sees a recurring loss
of Y12.8bn on a 3.2 per cent rise in sales to Y284bn.
Honshu sees current earnings falling 13.9 per cent to Y6.8bn and sales
declining 0.6 per cent to Y366.6bn.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: CRA blocks copper plant upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Southern Copper refinery and smelter at Port Kembla in New South Wales
may be closed permanently. This follows the announcement by CRA, the
Australian resources group controlled by Britain's RTZ, that it was refusing
to support a ADollars 230m (USDollars 170m) upgrade of the facility unless a
new partner was brought into the project to 'substantially' reduce CRA's
stake.
CRA currently holds a 60 per cent interest in the project, alongside two
Japanese investors - Furukawa with 30 per cent and Nissho Iwai Corporation
with 10 per cent. Just over half the investment relates to environmental
upgrading and the rest to expansion 'to achieve a viable scale of
operation', and would have taken place over the next two years.
CRA's move follows four weeks of strike action at the plant. Over 300
employees walked out on October 4 in protest at management plans to cut 40
jobs from the workforce of around 440. There has been minimal production
since then.
A decision on the plant's future is to be made by the Southern Copper board
this month.

<TEXT>
Strong demand for semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, coupled
with a restructuring programme, helped Oki Electric, the Japanese electrical
machinery maker, return to profitability in the first half of fiscal 1994.
Oki beat its own expectations and boosted non-consolidated sales in the
period by 6.6 per cent to Y273.1bn (USDollars 2.8bn) from Y256.2bn last
year.
The company recorded Y24.7bn in recurring profits - before extraordinary
items and tax - compared with a loss of Y6.8bn previously.
Buoyant demand for memory chips, particularly from the computer industry in
overseas markets, and strong orders for telecommunications equipment from
NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group with which Oki has
long-established ties, were the main factors behind the company's improved
performance, it said.
Oki also benefited from a cost-cutting programme it implemented at the
beginning of the term. Net profits totalled Y22.1bn against a loss of
Y12.4bn.
However, the company, which still had an accumulated loss of Y16.5bn at the
mid-term, passed its dividend.
The company forecasts sales of Y530bn in the full year, compared with an
earlier forecast of Y527bn.
Recurring profits are expected to total Y30bn, rather than Y10bn and net
profits are forecast at Y27bn, rather than Y6bn.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: HK bourse chief to focus on
quality of Chinese stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Edgar Cheng Wai-kin, who yesterday was elected chairman of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, said that under his stewardship the exchange would continue
reaching out to China, but that he was more interested in strengthening the
quality of Chinese companies listed in the territory than increasing their
numbers.
He said he would strive to ensure that the Chinese companies already listed
in Hong Kong would provide benchmark examples of good governance.
'Obviously, I would like to continue to see Hong Kong as a strong capital
formation centre as well as a major trading centre for Chinese securities.'
Dr Cheng, son-in-law of the late business tycoon Sir Y. K. Pao and chairman
of World-Wide Investment, a non-listed part of Sir Y. K's business group,
was elected chairman initially for one year, but if re-elected could serve
three terms - as did Dr Cheng's predecessor, Dr Charles Lee. He therefore
stands to steward the exchange through the colony's return to Beijing rule
in June 1997. He has strong connections with Chinese officials, and is a
Beijing-appointed Hong Kong affairs adviser.
Dr Cheng is active in business circles in Hong Kong and Singapore, and for
the past three years has served both the stock exchange and the futures
exchange at committee level.
Relations between the colony's two exchanges were hurt last week when the
futures exchange unveiled plans to launch futures contracts on selected
equities, a move for which it secured government blessing but omitted to
consult the marketplace in order to ensure confidentiality and a competitive
edge.
The stock exchange, saying the move posed questions of added risk and
volatility, believes the market (including itself) should have been
consulted.
Dr Cheng's appointment, which takes effect immediately, follows a week of
council elections that spurned many of the colony's big broking names.
Mr Alan Murray, director of Jardine Fleming, the brokerage jointly owned by
Jardine Matheson and Robert Fleming, lost his seat, while Mr Philip Tose,
founder and chairman of Peregrine Investments - one of the most successful
local securities and merchant banking houses - and Mr John Mulcahy, managing
director of UBS Securities in Hong Kong failed to secure representation.

Companhia Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of British American Tobacco,
announced a fall in third-quarter accumulated profits after tax to RDollars
52.14m (Dollars 61m), from RDollars 139.12m for the same period last year,
writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo.
Much of the profit was due to a sister company, Aracruz Celulose, which
contributed RDollars 32.85m.
This was a result of the effect of the overvalued local currency on
Aracruz's dollar debt and a recovery in world pulp prices.
Souza Cruz's profit from cigarettes and tobacco was RDollars 15.24m, mainly
due to exports, compared with RDollars 137.45m last year.
The company, which has an 80 per cent share of the local cigarette market,
blamed the fall in profits on a 10.9 per cent reduction in the cigarette
market, 'significant' levels of contraband cigarettes and a reduction in tax
payment periods.
During the nine-month period net sales were RDollars 740.8m compared with
RDollars 945.7m.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: US biotech groups announce
merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two US biotech companies announced their merger yesterday, a move which
could herald a series of similar moves from the cash-strapped sector, writes
Daniel Green.
Nexagen of Boulder, Colorado, and Vestar of San Dimas, California, will
merge to form Nexstar Pharmaceuticals. Nexagen was floated earlier this year
and, although it has the smaller market capitalisation, appears to be the
senior partner in the deal.
The new headquarters is in Boulder, and the chairman and chief executive of
the new company are from Nexagen.
The transaction will be effected through an exchange of 0.88 shares of
Nexagen for each Vestar share. Nexstar will have a market capitalisation of
aboutDollars 180m.
Mr Viren Mehta, of biotechnology specialist research boutique Mehta and
Isaly, said that the merger was 'indicative of the financial pressures in
the sector and on these two companies'.
He said that Nexagen's technology showed more promise than Vestar's even
though Vestar already had a product approved and on sale in Europe.

A lower effective tax rate and a reduction in financing costs allowed
Nampak, the South African paper and packaging group, to increase its
attributable profit for the year ended in September by 14 per cent to
R350.9m (Dollars 100.2m) from R307.9m, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
The results do not include a further R10.5m in abnormal profit arising from
the disposal of the Kliprivier brown paper machines. Operating profit rose
by only 6 per cent to R549.7m from R517.9m on the back of a modest 5 per
cent increase in turnover to R4.79bn from R4.5bn.
However, a 68 per cent reduction in interest paid to R10.3m from R32.1m,
combined with an almost unchanged tax bill at R201.4m, compared with R197.9m
previously, helped improve the bottom line.

Avenor, the Canadian forest products group, is moving steadily back towards
profitability with higher prices and surging demand for pulp, newsprint and
white papers and a lower Canadian dollar, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Third-quarter operating profit was CDollars 33.5m (USDollars 24.8m), against
an operating loss of CDollars 42.3m a year earlier, a turnround of CDollars
76m. However, after interest and special items, there was a loss of CDollars
16.6m, or 25 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 12.3m, or 20 cents,
on sales of CDollars 488m, up 40 per cent.
The nine-month final loss was CDollars 61.3m, or 93 cents a share, against a
loss of CDollars 125m, or CDollars 2.16, on sales of CDollars 1.38bn, up 21
per cent.
Avenor said newsprint price increases went through in the third quarter and
its machines were running flat out. Manufacturing cost is down nearly 9 per
cent.
US consumption will rise further in the fourth quarter and another price
increase has been announced for December 1.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Alarm bells ring over Telebras
tariffs - Brazil has returned to interventionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Brazilian government's recent decision to cut telephone rates for local,
long distance and international calls set alarm bells ringing.
Not only was there investor concern about the effect on the profits of
Telebras, Brazil's most traded stock, but more importantly the government
seemed to be returning to its interventionist ways. The government, however,
insists it is committed to tariff reform.
The rate cuts were spurred by competition from the so-called US call-back
companies, which charge much cheaper rates for international calls by
channelling them through the US, and by political expediency.
Mr Jonathan Morris, an analyst at Latinvest Securities in London, says that,
after announcing a more pragmatic tariff policy at the end of 1992, 'this
looks like the government is returning to the bad old days of political
intervention in tariffs'.
Analysts maintained that the move has failed to reform an artificial
structure in which cheap local calls and standing charges are subsidised by
an expensive long distance and international service.
As for Telebras, , the government-controlled phone company, the effect on
its revenues is hard to gauge.
Estimates range from neutral to a fall in revenues of up to Dollars 200m
next year. The uncertainty led Telebras's share price to fall sharply after
the announcement.
The reductions, which come into effect today, involve a 5 per cent cut in
local rates, a 17 to 20 per cent reduction in international tariffs and
higher discounts for off-peak national long distance calls.
The cut in local rates, which are among the lowest in the world, is regarded
by the market as a populist measure by President Itamar Franco and an
attempt to try to keep down prices as part of a government anti-inflation
plan.
The price cuts for international calls, which make up 10 to 12 per cent of
Telebras's revenues, are a reaction to the 'call-back' companies.
Telebras says the reductions, which follow price cuts of 41 per cent since
August last year, make Brazil's international rates comparable with those of
overseas phone companies. However, call-back companies say their prices are
still significantly cheaper than those of Telebras.
For example, the call-back companies charge Dollars 1 to Dollars 1.50 per
minute to most European countries while, after the reductions, Telebras will
charge Dollars 2.35.
Mr Marcelo Vainstein, an analyst at Baring Securities in Sao Paulo,
estimates the cuts in local and international rates will lead to a fall in
revenues of nearly Dollars 100m next year.
Increased discounts for national long-distance calls, which make up half the
company's revenues, could mean another Dollars 100m in lost revenues. But he
says it is difficult to predict the effect on the national long-distance
market because of a lack of information on the proportion of calls made
during off-peak hours.
In total, the price reductions could mean a fall of perhaps Dollars 80m in
Telebras's expected after-tax profits of around Dollars 600m next year on
revenues of some Dollars 6bn, he says.
This loss could be partly offset by increased volume but analysts' most
optimistic view is that the price reductions will have a neutral impact on
revenues. They say Telebras's international calls are still comparatively
expensive and long distance traffic is largely made up of business users,
whose tariffs have not been reduced.
For Telebras's future financial health an overhaul of the tariff structure
is essential. The government has only partly implemented a restructuring
announced in December 1992 under which the cross subsidy of local service by
long distance and international rates was due to be phased out.
In addition, the government has not implemented the decision to increase
charges for basic services: Telebras's monthly standing charge is 44 cents,
compared with Dollars 4 in Mexico and Dollars 5.50 in Chile.
The effect of this tariff structure is that Telebras's revenues per line are
less than Dollars 500, compared with about Dollars 800 for Telefonica de
Argentina and Dollars 1,000 for Telmex.
The lack of revenues puts pressure on Telebras's capital investment, which
stand at about Dollars 3bn a year, half what is needed to cope with demand
for lines, given that waiting times are up to two years.
But Mr Renato Guerreiro, head of the government's phone tariffs department,
says the government was still committed to the tariff reform, which was
suspended in July when Brazil's new Real currency was launched.
He maintained the the government was 'waiting for the right moment
politically'. But Mr Guerreiro said regardless of when the reform takes
place, international calls would fall further because Telebras's rates were
still higher than call-back companies.
In the longer term, most analysts expect tariff reform to be carried out
following the election this month of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who has
said he favours liberalisation of the government's telecom monopoly.
The recent tariff cuts, however, will not please investors in Telebras, says
Mr Morris of Latinvest. 'It appears that while investors have been expecting
a more pragmatic approach to telecommunications in Brazil the government is
busy paddling in the opposite direction.'

Caribbean country, said that, as in the previous year, there was no tax
liability as a result of accumulated tax losses being brought forward.
The profits were affected by the 25 per cent depreciation of the Trinidad
dollar when it was floated in April 1993. 'The increase in net profit was
influenced to a large extent by the effects of the flotation on net incoming
international revenues,' the company said.

<TEXT>
Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment group, yesterday appointed Mr
Richard Parsons, 46, the chairman of New York savings bank Dime Bancorp, as
its new president. He takes over from Mr Gerald Levin, who remains chairman
and chief executive.
Although the appointment of a banker to the number two spot appeared to be
an unusual move, Mr Parsons has been a member of the group's board of
directors since 1990 and has also worked on the boards of TriStar Pictures
and the cable group American Television &amp; Communications.
He is also a respected figure in local and national politics, having
previously worked with New York Mayor Mr Rudolph Giuliani, and in Washington
in the administrations of former vice-president Nelson Rockefeller and
former president Gerald Ford. His ties to the political, banking and Wall
Street communities are believed to have played a key part in his
appointment.
As president at Time Warner, Mr Parsons will be responsible for many of the
day-to-day administrative functions of the group, including the running of
all corporate financial activities (with the help of new finance chief, Time
Warner senior vice-president Mr Richard Bressler), legal affairs, staff
management and corporate communications.
In a separate development, Time Warner was expected yesterday to announce
the appointment of Mr Danny Goldberg as the new chairman of its Warner
Brothers Records unit, the world's largest record company.
Mr Goldberg, currently head of Time Warner's Atlantic Records label, is
expected to be asked to take over the helm at Warner Brothers.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Interpublic to acquire media
buyer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Interpublic, the US advertising group, said it would acquire Western
International Media, the country's largest independent media-buying company,
in a deal which appeared to signal a consolidation of the US media-buying
industry.
The deal could also indicate a push by the US group into the media-buying
business in Europe, which is currently dominated by locally-based groups. Mr
Dennis Holt, Western's president, said the link with Interpublic would give
his customers access to European markets through the adver-tising group's
offices there.
Media buyers purchase advertising space in bulk and sell it on to
advertisers, either directly or through other agencies. The greater
bargaining power available to big buyers has prompted a consolidation in the
European industry.
The acquisition of Western, which claims to buy Dollars 1.6bn of air time
and other advertising space a year, could indicate an acceleration of the
same trend in the US. It represents the first big acquisition by
Interpublic, which has annual billings of Dollars 15bn and whose agencies
include McCann-Erickson, Lintas and the Lowe group. These agencies each
currently buy their own media space.
The planned deal prompted other advertising industry executives to suggest
that Interpublic was preparing to merge all its activities in this area into
one company, creating a giant in the US media-buying industry.
However, a spokesman for Interpublic denied that the Western acquisition
would lead to a merging of the media-buying operations: 'We have no
intention of combining them. It's a free-standing acquisition.'
This was seen in part as an attempt to ease concerns among the many smaller
US advertising agencies which currently use Western to buy their media
space.
European-based advertisers have also been exploring ways to expand their US
media-buying muscle. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, which in 1989 combined its European
media buying activities in a single company, Zenith, is currently studying
whether to adopt the same course in the US.
Together with the acquisition of an independent media-buyer, Saatchi
estimates the consolidation of its activities in Zenith has given it about a
sixth of the total European market.
The terms of yesterday's deal were not disclosed.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: P&amp;G, Unilever soap wars leave
market spinning - Consumers have yet to pick a winner as P&amp;G launches a new
detergent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under harsh artificial sunlight, deep inside Procter &amp; Gamble's laundry
laboratory in Brussels, there seems no doubt: Ariel Futur, P&amp;G's ripost in
the Great European Soap War, and launched today in the UK, is superior to
Unilever's Persil and Omo Power detergents, famous for their
textile-damaging side-effects.
Be it blood, oil, or other nasty, staining substances, Ariel Futur, cleans
best, claim P&amp;G staff. But the reality of the Pounds 6bn (Dollars 9.5bn)
marketplace, they acknowledge, is more complicated than life in the
laboratory. Consumers, bombarded by claims and counter-claims by the two
companies, are confused.
Unilever launched its Power products this spring, hailing them as a leap
forward as significant for detergents as transistors were for electronics.
P&amp;G hit back with assertions that Power damaged clothes, and showed tattered
underwear to prove it. Independent arbiters failed to settle the dispute:
consumer associations in some countries slammed Unilever's new detergent,
while others endorsed it.
Both sides claim they have increased the market shares of their ranges of
detergents during the summer. But Unilever admits that Persil and Omo Power
sales have fallen after every bout of bad publicity, and have had to be
rebuilt through extensive promotions and advertising.
Into this bruising world of no-holds barred marketing, P&amp;G is launching
Ariel Futur (as spelt on Continental packaging; it is called Future for the
British). Futur 'represents a considerable technological advance in washing
powders', says P&amp;G.
With its manganese catalyst 'accelerator' in Power, Unilever 'stuck a rocket
motor on a Ford Cortina. The detergent can't take the power', a P&amp;G
spokesman said during the Power furore this summer. 'With Futur, we've
redesigned the car from the wheel nuts up.'
More enzymes have been added to improve stain removal and an inhibitor helps
prevent dyes transferring from one garment to another in the wash. A new
bleach and water softener complete the formula. It incorporates 11 new
technologies and has taken five years to devise. About 25 per cent less soap
powder is needed per wash compared with existing detergents, reducing
packaging by 30 per cent. Unilever makes similar claims for its Power
detergents.
To substantiate its in-house findings, P&amp;G commissioned three independent,
anonymous test institutes to compare Futur with Omo Power. Overall, Futur
was better than Power at removing food, body soil, general soil and grease
stains but worse at cleaning drink stains.
But close reading of the results shows that the competing powders are more
evenly matched, making it hard for consumers to decide which one is superior
in the kitchen, rather than ideal laboratory conditions.
Taking a wide range of stains, one institute scored 14 'wins' for Futur over
Power, six draws where neither was better and two losses to Power. The other
two institutes scored 11-5-2 and 14-11-2 respectively.
'Power is about the best of competing products,' a P&amp;G executive
acknowledges, but its Achilles heel is the catalyst. P&amp;G says despite lower
concentrations of the catalyst in the current version of Power, it is still
attacking a wide range of dyes.
Unilever says all detergents damage textiles and Power's adverse effects
will only become apparent outside the normal lifespan of a garment.
Meanwhile, it is searching for a way to stop the catalyst reacting badly
with some dyes.
Futur was launched in its first market, Germany, some six weeks ago.
Officially launched in the UK today, it will not hit shop shelves until
January, accompanied by a Pounds 7m television advertising campaign. P&amp;G
promises no knocking copy.
Nevertheless, Unilever is bracing itself for further bloody encounters.

Thomson Corporation, the travel and publishing group controlled by the
Thomson family of Toronto, Canada, is to acquire a Ziff Communications
subsidiary, Information Access Company, for Dollars 465m.
The deal is the second step in Ziff's plan to divest all of its assets. Last
week Ziff, a privately held US publishing group, sold the biggest segment of
its business, Ziff-Davis Publishing, to Forstmann Little, a New York
investment group, for Dollars 1.4bn.
IAC, based in Foster City, California, is a leading provider of reference
and database services to libraries and businesses.
It offers a wide range of business, legal, healthcare, humanities, computer
and general interest information services in several electronic formats,
including CD-ROM, on-line database access, and magnetic tape.
More than 20,000 US public and academic libraries, as well as 10,000
corporate libraries, subscribe to IAC services.
The acquisition is seen as a move by Thomson to expand its North American
publishing activities, which are among the most profitable parts of its
business.
Thomson was one of the losing bidders for another database company, the
Lexis/Nexis electronic-publishing arm of Mead of the US which was bought for
Dollars 1.5bn by Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, earlier
this month.
With 1993 sales of Dollars 5.9bn, Thomson is a leading publisher of
specialised professional and business reference materials. The group also
owns several regional newspapers in North America and the UK, including its
flagship publication, the Toronto Globe and Mail.
Thomson's Information/Publishing Group accounted for Dollars 2.8bn in sales
last year. In the UK, Thomson also has extensive leisure travel operations,
including its holiday tour business.

western Europe banks
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three west European banks are considering bids for Hungary's Budapest Bank,
one of the country's top four commercial banks, in a display of renewed
enthusiasm for acquisitions in the former communist bloc.
Credit Suisse and ING Bank are understood to have emerged in the past few
weeks as potential contenders in what would be one of eastern Europe's
biggest bank privatisations.
They join Credit Agricole, the French co-operative bank, which has for
several months shown interest in taking a stake. It is the only main
contender to have conducted a 'due diligence' investigation of the Hungarian
target.
Some bankers in Budapest had singled out Credit Agricole as the strongest or
even sole bidder until the emergence of the three possible rivals.
A stake in Budapest Bank would provide Credit Suisse with a means of
expansion to the east after the failure of its approach to Creditanstalt of
Austria.
Hungary expects to name a preferred bidder or bidders on November 17, which
gives Credit Agricole time advantage. But to open up the race, the state
bank and its advisers have given the last-minute bidders another fortnight
to prepare proposals.
The successful industry investor is expected to pair up with the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The most
likely option is that together they would hold a majority and the EBRD would
hold the swing vote.
Creditanstalt, one of Austria's leading banks, explored an offer but
management divisions are understood to have inhibited an approach.
The sharpening rivalry for Budapest Bank marks a shift in western banks'
strategies in eastern Europe. State banks in the region have shown a strong
propensity to make bad loans and the preferred means of establishing a
presence has been to set up stand-alone branches.
But in two deals in the last 12 months ING Bank and Bayerische Landesbank
took 25 per cent stakes in a Polish and a Hungarian bank respective-ly.
Budapest Bank's privatisation could be the most significant transaction to
date. Much depends on the terms and shareholding offered. But it has total
assets of Ft156.6bn (Dollars 1.47bn), and a Hungarian official hoped for a
purchase price of up to Dollars 100m.

Operating profit at Maculan, the Austrian construction group with large
operations in eastern Germany, plunged in the first half by 42 per cent to
Sch81.7m (Dollars 7.69m). It also forecast lower net income in the full
year.
Turnover was up 14 per cent to Sch6.9bn, due to a 19 per cent increase in
Germany, which accounted for just over half of group revenue.
The group said the decline in operating profit was due to delays in Russian
housing projects for returning soldiers and to a dispute over the cost of
unforeseen difficulties in a tunnel project in Aus-tria.

FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Accor pulls the shutters down -
John Ridding and Michael Skapinker examine the group's position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerard Pelisson and Mr Paul Dubrule have seen many more ups than downs in
the 27 years in which they have built Accor of France into one of the
world's largest hotel and travel groups.
The past two months, however, have brought a series of setbacks which the
group's founders and co-chairmen would probably prefer to forget.
In September, Accor was defeated by Forte of the UK in a fiercely contested
battle to win control of Meridien Hotels, which had been put up for sale by
Air France. A few weeks later, Mr Pelisson and Mr Dubrule became entangled
in a wrangle with Suez, the financial and industrial group which is Accor's
largest shareholder.
Last week, the group announced its first-ever loss, saying it had incurred a
net half-year deficit of FFr264m (Dollars 51m), compared with a net profit
of FFr109m for the same period in 1993.
The financial performance and signs of shareholder disaffection raised
important question about the group's prospects and strategy. They even
prompted some to consider whether France's flagship leisure company be taken
over. Could a successful predator break up the group, finding buyers for
some of its assets, which range from the Novotel hotel chain to the Europcar
car rental business to luncheon vouchers?
Analysts were particularly intrigued by the apparent breach between Accor
and normally loyal French institutional shareholders.
Last month, after protracted discussions, Accor said it had broken off
negotiations aimed at increasing Suez's 12.4 per cent stake, held through
its subsidiary Societe Generale de Belgique. Accor cited 'unreasonable'
demands by Suez, which it claimed was seeking a significant management role
and the right to select a successor when the co-chairmen stand down.
Messrs Dubrule and Pelisson have little time for speculation about
instability on the shareholder register. 'We have no fear of a takeover. SGB
has said it would keep its holding and 'we have faithful long term
investors', said Mr Pelisson, citing Societe Generale, the French bank, and
Union des Assurances de Paris, the insurer. The Caisse des Depots et
Consignations, the French state financial institution, has also distanced
itself from speculation that it might sell its 6.14 per cent stake in Accor.
An additional reason for caution concerning the emergence of predators is
that both the group and industry analysts think Accor's situation is better
than might have been expected.
Accor itself is sanguine in the face of last week's loss and is upbeat about
prospects for the rest of the year. The company points to improved operating
results, arguing that 15 of its 18 principal profit centres were ahead at
the nine-month stage compared with the same period in 1993. They explain
that much of the reason for the loss at the net level in the first six
months was the absence of exceptional gains from disposals. First-half
profits of FFr109m in 1993 were achieved only after capital gains of more
than FFr400m during the period.
This perspective is shared by many industry observers. 'I was not surprised
by the loss,' says an analyst at one French merchant bank. He, like many
industry observers, was also encouraged by the chairmen's optimism following
the announcement of the results. Mr Pelisson said: 'The bad news is the
loss. The good news is that over the past several months we have seen a
substantial improvement in the hotels business.'
Nevertheless, there is still concern about the group's prospects and
strategy. Most immediately, the company continues to struggle under a debt
burden of about FFr22bn, about one and a half times shareholders' equity.
The rise of the debt reflects the aggressive expansive strategy pursued by
the company, notably the acquisition of the Motel 6 chain in the US in 1990
and of Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel group in 1991.
'The debt situation is a concern,' says one Paris-based analyst. But he
believes that the company is now taking active steps to improve its
financial position.
This sentiment is shared by investors who have pushed Accor's share price up
by 20 per cent since the announcement of the first-half results, recovering
from the sharp losses prior to the news. The COB, the French stock-market
watchdog, is investigating the falls over the previous two weeks.
The strong rally reflects a belief that the company will now focus on core
businesses and reduce its debts.
Accor has identified FFr5bn of potential assets it could sell, from which
FFr2.5bn worth of receipts are expected by the end of 1995. The group is
looking for an investor in its Sofitel luxury hotel chain after its failure
to win control of Meridien. Accor wants to continue running the chain, but
would like an investor to take a majority stake in the assets.
Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, says: 'That's going to be
a tall order. Sofitel is a very tired brand that has suffered from
under-investment.'
One solution may be Prince Al Waleed of Saudi Arabia. The prince gave
financial backing to Accor's bid for Meridien. Last month he took a 25 per
cent stake in Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based luxury hotels chain.
Neither chairman would be drawn on the prince's possible interest. But one
industry analyst said: 'He is a definite possibility. He has capital and he
isn't hostile.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banque Nationale de Paris, one of France's leading banks and privatised last
year, is selling Banque Nagelmackers 1747, Belgium's oldest bank.
The bank, in which BNP became the majority shareholder four years ago, is to
be sold to P and V Assurances of Belgium. The sale will also apply to a
related concern, Nagelmackers &amp; Company.
BNP stressed that the sale conditions would guarantee the bank's development
and the service to its clients, and that Nagelmackers would continue to
market BNP products.
BNP bought the majority of the shares in Banque Nagelmackers in 1990, with
the remaining stake held by the Nagelmackers family.
This August it acquired nearly all the remaining shares when Financiere
Lecocq, a co-shareholder with which it made the original takeover, exercised
its option to sell.
BNP earlier this year denied suggestions it was planning to sell Banque
Nagelmackers.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Inspirations to launch own airline next
spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inspirations, the tour operator which floated on the Unlisted Securities
Market last December, is to launch its own airline next spring.
The airline, to be called International Airways, will be run by Mr Eamonn
Mullaney, former managing director of Caledonian Airways, British Airways'
charter airline.
International Airways is to lease three new Airbus A320 aircraft, to be
delivered in April 1995.
Mr Vic Fatah, Inspirations' chief executive, said the launch of the airline
posed no threat to the company's future. He said other airlines which had
run into trouble, such as Laker Airways, Air Europe and Dan-Air, had done so
because of problems with scheduled services.
International Airways will operate only in the charter market.
Mr Fatah said Inspirations had decided to launch the airline because the
price of chartering other companies' aircraft had risen in recent months. He
did not think the increases were a temporary phenomenon.
The company said the three aircraft would accommodate nearly all
Inspirations' winter customers.
Mr Mullaney said, however, that the aircraft would give Inspirations
slightly more capacity than it needed for its own summer customers.
The reason for the disparity was that winter flying involved using the
aircraft to reach long-haul destinations such as India. Summer flights were
to destinations such as Palma in Majorca, which is near enough for one
aircraft to make the same journey several times in a day.
The company would have no difficulty selling the excess summer seats to
other tour operators, said Mr Mullaney.
The new airline would not be dependent on rival tour operators to fill
excess capacity on its winter flights as all seats could, if necessary, be
taken up by Inspirations' customers.
Mr Fatah said that Inspirations was on target to fulfil its flotation
undertaking that it would acquire or start up 50 travel agency outlets in
its first year.
He said the company had 47 retail outlets so far, which were being run by
the travel agency chain AT Mays.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Foods continues recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted cake and biscuit maker, continued
its recovery with an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 104,000
to Pounds 355,000, and may return to the dividend list once a group
reorganisation is completed.
The recovery was helped by a continuing improvement in the manufacturing
side, further growth in the distribution business and a five months'
contribution from Jesse Oldfield, the cake maker NFF bought for Pounds 2.56m
in April.
Operating profit for the six months to September 30 was ahead at Pounds
586,000 (Pounds 288,000), with Pounds 221,000 (nil) from acquisitions.
Turnover was up at Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 8.09m), with acquisitions
contributing Pounds 3.76m (nil).
The company is reorganising its structure to increase efficiency and reduce
costs, said Mr Philip Wilbraham, chairman. This will also enable it 'to
resume dividend payments when appropriate earnings and gearing levels
allow'.
Earnings were 0.58p (0.28p).

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech new cancer drug - Third
promising treatment makes company one of best in sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first clinical trials of a new cancer treatment from British Biotech,
revealed yesterday, showed that the drug has no significant side effects and
triggers a potentially useful reaction in volunteers.
The drug, code-named BB-10010, is the third of British Biotech's cancer
drugs to show promise in trials.
The success so far of the others, led by Batimastat, has made the company
one of the best share-price performers this year in the UK and US
biotechnology sectors.
Yesterday, the shares rose 18p to 598p, giving a market value of almost
Pounds 300m, making it the tenth biggest in the UK and US sectors combined.
BB-10010 was tested on 36 healthy volunteers. As well as demonstrating its
safety, tests on the volunteers showed that the number of white blood cells
in the blood increased, as predicted in animal trials.
Quantitative measurements of this effect will be made at the next stage of
trials.
The drug has two potential uses: to protect the bone marrow from damage
during chemotherapy and to mobilise white blood cells so that they can be
'harvested' from the blood before chemotherapy and reinjected afterwards.
Currently, patients have bone marrow itself removed before chemotherapy and
replaced afterwards, an awkward and painful treatment.
Tepnel Life Sciences, the biotechnology company, has signed a marketing deal
for its Daras technology, a product for screening DNA patterns in infectious
diseases. Peers, the New York-based subsidiary of the Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan, will seek suitable licensing or joint venture partners for Tepnel
in Japan.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Looking forward to the end of the price war
 -The Herald's postponed float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shockwaves from the newspaper price war have extended far beyond Fleet
Street. For The Herald, the Glasgow-based morning paper, the resultant loss
of sales has helped postpone its stock exchange flotation, which was
expected to take place in mid-1995.
Caledonian Publishing, the paper's owner, badly wants to escape the
treadmill of heavy interest payments on the debt taken on when management
bought the business from Lonrho in May 1992. Lonrho sold George Outram, as
it was then called, for Pounds 74m in a deal organised by the merchant bank
Robert Fleming, the lead investor.
The company had to raise a further Pounds 20m for working capital and to buy
the newspaper presses, which had been leased.
Though costly, the MBO was a cause for celebration in Scotland. A new
Scottish company had been born and The Herald had escaped the clutches of an
owner which did little to strengthen the business. But the past two and a
half years have not been as successful as the buy-out team - led by Mr Liam
Kane, chief executive - had hoped.
The Herald, founded in 1783, is one of Scotland's two quality dailies,
mainly serving Glasgow and the west of Scotland. It is more cheerful and
broad-minded than The Scotsman, whose heartland is around its Edinburgh base
and whose circulation is more than 80,000 compared with The Herald's current
111,000.
Caledonian Publishing also owns the Evening Times, the Glasgow evening
paper, and a number of magazines, including the Scottish Farmer. Its
turnover last year was Pounds 59m.
After the buy-out Mr Kane, a former News International executive, embarked
on strengthening the two newspapers and reducing their operating costs.
The company invested Pounds 2m in on-screen page make-up and in introducing
new sections to The Herald, devoted to business, homes and gardens, jobs,
property and sport.
The Evening Times launched a weekend newspaper.
A series of cut-backs in the advertising, circulation and production
departments have reduced staff numbers in the group from 1,045 at the time
of the MBO, incurring exceptional costs of Pounds 11m. By the end of this
year the headcount will have fallen to 813.
Yet The Herald's circulation has never regained the peak of 125,000 reached
in February 1992. The newspaper dropped 'Glasgow' from its title but any
benefit to sales was cancelled out by economic gloom.
Average circulation in the financial year to September 1993 was 115,000
(compared with the previous year's 119,500).
Despite expensive TV advertising, The Herald has not made as much progress
as it had hoped outside Strathclyde region, where sales now stand at about
30,000,
'Economic recovery is under way now but it is led by manufacturing rather
than consumption,' said Mr Kane.
Caledonian Publishing's operating profit fell from Pounds 10m in 1992-93 to
Pounds 8m in 1993-94, with a drop in operating margin from 17 to 14 per
cent.
In July Mr Kane told staff: 'Despite a lot of work in reducing costs, we are
still hugely uncompetitive compared with the newspaper groups we face in the
daily battle for readers and advertisers.'
He launched a further programme of cost cutting and redundancies, this time
biting into The Herald's editorial department, and trimmed a staff pay rise.
Caledonian Publishing also had to go back to its banking syndicate, led by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, to borrow a further Pounds 5m. Although it has
repaid Pounds 5.5m of the Pounds 43m it took on in 1992, it faced having to
defer repayment of Pounds 2m because of its inadequate profit performance,
and took on another Pounds 3m to cover further redundancies and other costs.
That means interest payments, which had declined from Pounds 6m in 1992-93
to Pounds 5.3m in 1993-94, will rise to about Pounds 5.6m this year.
The price war has only aggravated matters. Mr Kane says the cut in the price
of The Times last year to 30p did not make much difference to The Herald;
but this June the Daily Telegraph cut its price from 50p to 30p, followed by
a further price cut by The Times and a cut by The Independent.
Though the bulk of the circulation of The Herald is protected because most
of its readers buy it for its Scottish coverage, the price war reduced the
paper's sales by 2 per cent this summer.
A cut in the The Herald's cover price was out of the question.
However, the largest single effect of the price war, says Mr Ron MacDonald,
Caledonian Publishing's finance director, has been to reduce the
price/earnings ratios of newspapers on the stock exchange. 'Until there is a
change of sentiment regarding national newspapers as well as regionals, then
the Caledonian float can wait,' he says.
It is projecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.8m for the current year and Mr
Kane says there has recently been some improvement in advertising. A float
next year, he says, is 'still a possibility'.
A flotation would have other benefits for The Herald. 'I'm still waiting for
them to deliver the product I know they are capable of, but don't seem to
have the finance to achieve,' says Ms Christine Tulloch, media director of
Faulds Advertising, one of Scotland's leading agencies.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Panther makes Pounds 1.13m for six months
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In its first results since taking over Etonbrook Properties in July, Panther
Securities, the property company headed by Mr Andrew Perloff, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.13m for the six months to June 30 against Pounds
707,354 for the year to December 31.
The result included a Pounds 920,000 profit on the disposal of shares in
Cementone, formerly Multitrust.
Panther now has 85 per cent of Etonbrook. Mr Perloff said that although the
acquisition had brought Pounds 2.5m in cash and Pounds 2.2m of uncharged
properties before the minority interest, the benefits would not be apparent
until the second half.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 3.47m (Pounds 3.28m for 12 months). Earnings per
share were 49.3p (33.8p) and an interim dividend of 1.1p is declared. A 1.6p
final is anticipated.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Improving the survival index - Daniel Green
and Tim Burt analyse biotech investment prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is the UK biotechnology sector now becoming respectable?
British Biotech has consolidated its position in the world's top handful of
biotechnology companies by market value, and others, such as Celltech and
Scotia, are making steady progress through clinical trials.
But investors have yet to be convinced.
British Biotech is alone among those joining the market in recent years to
see its shares remain above the flotation price.
And the sister sector in the US continues to labour under the burden of poor
sentiment.
Investor scepticism in the US has left companies there in serious financial
difficulties. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young say 50 per cent of the industry has
sufficient capital only for the next two years.
In its latest biotechnology annual report, the firm has cut its survival
index - the time until the cash runs out - for the median US company from 34
months to 25 months. Some 26 per cent of companies are scheduled to run out
of cash within a year unless they can find new sources of finance.
This is happening at a time when investor confidence in the sector is at a
low ebb.
There has been a series of failures ' three in the last two weeks alone  -
of drugs at the latest stages of clinical trials, when most of the
uncertainties ought to have been eliminated.
The consequence of failure is usually a slide in the company's share price
and an unforgiving mood among investors, most of whom have yet to warm to
the sector. Without the confidence of City or Wall Street investors, biotech
companies have turned for funding to drugs companies. Deals have been
concluded, for instance, between Celltech and Merck, Proteus and American
Home Products, and Celltech and Bayer of Germany.
The strategy is risky because pharmaceuticals companies try to buy control
of a biotechnology company's products.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman of the acquisitive drugs company Medeva, warns
that biotech companies which seek support through alliances are 'selling
their birthrights'.
Nevertheless, Mr Louis da Gama, executive director of the BioIndustry
Association, says that 'mergers and acquisitions are likely to be the
dominant aspect of the industry over the next five years'.
Biotechnology company executives recognise that strategic alliances may cost
a company dearly in terms of lost future earnings.
They follow two simple strategies to limit the damage:
Good news items about progress, however minor, in drug trials is published.
Little effort is made to point out that success at the early stages means
little.
Less than one third of drugs that successfully complete Phase I trials
eventually become products, according to stockbroker Lehman Brothers.
Drugs are pushed through trials quickly because the more advanced the
clinical research, the higher the price it fetches in cash-raising
negotiations. Some borderline drugs that might have been dropped by a larger
company make it through to the late stages of testing. Only in the glare of
large scale trials do they show up their weaknesses.
But these tactics risk lulling investors into thinking their company is
doing better than it really is.
'Some UK biotech companies are asking us to accept 'good news' without so
much as even a scientific meeting abstract let alone a peer reviewed
publication,' complains Mr Ian Smith, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
He says that UK biotech companies are not as vulnerable to failure as many
of their US rivals because they have broader development portfolios.
Nevertheless, the statistics imply that some of the UK biotech sector's
drugs that now look promising will fail at some stage.
The sector may be approaching respectability, but it is in its nature to
continue to deliver a few nasty surprises.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Biocompatibles considers offer despite
imminent flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Biocompatibles International, the research company aiming to raise Pounds
40m from its imminent flotation, was yesterday said to be discussing a
possible takeover offer.
The loss-making company, which has developed a new type of contact lens, was
expected shortly to announce the pricing for its shares as part of a placing
and intermediaries offer.
Directors of the company, however, have recently been considering proposals
for a joint venture, merger or sale. The bid is thought to have emerged only
after the publication last month of its pathfinder prospectus.
That showed that Biocompatibles, which describes itself as a manufacturer of
medical devices rather than a biotechnology business, had accumulated losses
of Pounds 9.77m at the end of June, and warned that investment in the
company involved a higher than normal degree of risk.
Robert Fleming, sponsors to the issue, said impact day had not been delayed,
adding that 'there had never been a fixed timetable for the pricing'.
If the flotation goes ahead, the group is expected to have a market value of
about Pounds 80m.
Of the Pounds 40m which is being raised, Pounds 25m will be placed firm,
with the balance available to meet retail demand through intermediaries.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GBE shares down to 33p after fall into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in GBE International, the engineering company, fell 5p to 33p, their
lowest level of the year, following the announcement of losses for the first
half of 1994 and the immediate departure of its finance director.
The company said its pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.95m, against profits of Pounds
1.08m, followed a review of its order book, costs and manufacturing
processes. Turnover fell by Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 15m.
Mr Gerald Edwards, chairman and chief executive, said the company was now
trading profitably but it would still be in loss at the year end. He added
that he was optimistic for 1995.
Although losses per share were 5.53p (earnings 1.37p) an initial interim
dividend of 0.5p is being paid and a final dividend of at least 1p is
expected. Last year there was a single payment of 1.25p.
The core process engineering division suffered operating losses of Pounds
3.87m (profits Pounds 1.3m). Packaging profits improved from Pounds 6,000 to
Pounds 158,000.

in sterling terms of the benchmark IFCI Latin American Index.
Net revenue for the period was Pounds 71,000, which represented in the main

The Pounds 6m turnaround was partly the result of a substantial decrease in
exceptional costs, which helped bring about an operating profit of Pounds

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pascoe's Group, the pet food manufacturer, reported that the expected
improvement in the six months to July 2 did not materialise. Mr Douglas
Strachan, chairman, blamed 'several unforeseen factors'.
He added that the results reflected the costs of restructuring the business.
The shares closed at 30p, a fall of 25 per cent since before the results
announcement.
On turnover of Pounds 4.36m (Pounds 8.31m), including Pounds 25,000 (Pounds
4.12m) from discontinued activities, pre-tax losses were halved at Pounds
1.26m (Pounds 2.5m). The result was stuck after provisions of Pounds 609,000
(Pounds 1.13m) relating to property write-downs.
The company expects net assets to fall below half paid up nominal share
capital and has arranged for a Pounds 400,000 convertible loan note to be
issued to an existing shareholder, who will also underwrite the issue of new
shares worth Pounds 225,000.
Losses per share were 8.57p (34.21p) or 6.61p fully diluted.

The Van Diemen's Land Company, the Australian pastoral company, has applied
to the London Stock Exchange to cancel the listing of its ordinary shares
with effect from 8.30am on November 14.
The move comes as a result of VDL's long-standing non-compliance with the
rule that requires more than 25 per cent of the share capital to be in
public hands.
Tasman Agriculture, VDL's majority shareholder, is to make the minority
shareholders a cash offer for their shares following the delisting. The
directors of VDL will then announce details of a rights issue to finance

<TEXT>
Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, cut pre-tax losses
from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 198,000 in the six months to June 30.
Turnover in the period rose by 8.6 per cent from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds
26.6m. Last year's figure, however, included Pounds 168,000 from
discontinued operations. At the operating level there was a profit of Pounds
95,000, against a deficit of Pounds 912,000 last time.
The pre-tax outcome was helped by the absence of exceptional items - last
year the company booked an Pounds 815,000 loss on disposal of a subsidiary
undertaking, less a release of closure provisions of Pounds 78,000 made in
1991. The net interest charge rose from Pounds 228,000 to Pounds 293,000.
Losses per share came out at 1.4p (7.9p).

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: GrandMet taps new market for Dollars 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, is to raise Dollars 500m
(Pounds 316m) in the United States through an issue of perpetual fixed rate
preferred securities, a financial instrument similar to preferred stock.
The issue, one of the biggest in the US preferred market this year, is part
of the group's efforts to reduce its short-term debt and diversify funding
sources. It follows a Dollars 1.2bn zero coupon bond and a Dollars 600m
Eurobond issue earlier this year.
Part of the attraction is the tax advantages linked to the way the deal has
been structured.
A new subsidiary set up as a limited partnership in the state of Delaware,
will issue the securities. The proceeds are then loaned to the UK parent and
on to a separate foreign operating subsidiary.
The coupons on the inter-company loan will be tax deductible. Delaware
company law allows businesses to be classed as partnerships for tax and
companies for reporting purposes.
'We have developed a structure which provides the economic equivalent of a
parent issue of preferred stock at an attractive cost,' explained Mr Nick
Rose, group treasurer of GrandMet. 'It will further lengthen the maturity
profile of our funding and will improve gearing and interest cover.'
Mr Calum Osborne, executive director, capital markets, at Goldman Sachs,
co-lead manager of the issue and bookrunner, said the deal could be a model
for other companies seeking to raise capital in the US.
Although the new securities will be classified as 'minority interests' and
give the company a similar degree of flexibility as an equity issue, funding
costs will be lower than an issue of preference shares and only slightly
more expensive - than an issue of debt.
UK and other European companies have ventured into the US preferred market
over the last five years, but this is the first time a UK group has issued
preferred securities.
'Preferred securities are low cost, non-voting securities, (and) represent
an attractive and important source of non-dilutive, quasi equity capital,
which to date have been unavailable to UK corporation,' said Goldman Sachs,
GrandMet also hopes to widen its investor base in the US, arguing that the
paper should prove attractive to retail investors.
'It is an important development in the evolution of UK and other foreign
issuers to access the fixed rate preference share market', said Mr Bruce
Macfarlane, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, the other co-lead manager.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Heron's creditors stifle a yawn -
Christopher Price finds financial interests have overcome apathy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boredom has been among the biggest problems faced by the corporate
financiers trying to stitch together the offer for Heron, which was
published yesterday after five months of careful negotiations.
'Heron has been through so many crises, restructurings and meetings over the
past three years that everyone involved is frankly bored to death with it,'
said one banker close to the negotiations.
'They just want the situation over with.'
Not that any apathy over the proceedings interfered too greatly with the
various parties' financial interests. Heron creditors are split into two
basic groups. First, there are those who were the subject of yesterday's
offer from HNV Acquisition - namely creditor banks, numbering around 30,
several thousand bondholders and other shareholders of Heron Group. These
are owed a total of Pounds 374m.
The second group comprises creditors of Heron's subsidiaries, who are owed
around Pounds 220m. HNV's bankers have secured the agreement of this group
to the Heron restructuring, provided the main Heron creditors accept the
offer on the table.
This group is divided into UK and Spanish property interests. There are
about 35 creditors to the UK side, owed in the region of Pounds 120m. The 18
creditors to the Spanish interests are owed the balance.
The UK creditors to the subsidiaries were the easier of the two to bring on
board, according to sources close to the negotiations - partly because their
loans are secured on a strong portfolio of properties, and also because
several bankers belonged to both sets of creditor groups.
The offer document puts pro forma net assets for the UK business at Pounds
202m. However, the net asset figure for the Spanish side only reaches
positive territory after an agreed injection of some Pounds 17m from HNV on
completion of the deal.
Negotiations on this part of the deal were politely described as 'strenuous'
by one of the bankers present: 'The Spanish were worried that they might
lose money on this. There was some tough talking.'
That done, the deal must now be sold to the bankers, bondholders and
shareholders of the parent company, some of whom face a second dilution of
their investments in just over a year. Under a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing
agreed in September 1993, the banks and bondholders had their debt converted
into senior and junior debt. The senior bank debt is about Pounds 120m,
while the senior bond debt amounts to Pounds 180m. There is also some Pounds
74m of junior debt.
HNV is offering Pounds 450 in cash or 300 HNV shares for every Pounds 1,000
of senior bonds, Pounds 60 or 40 shares for every Pounds 1,000 of junior
bonds and Pounds 7.50 or five shares for every 1,000 common shares.
HNV says it is 'optimistic' partly because the banks concerned have been
aware for some months of the terms proposed. A steering committee of the
frontline lenders has been authorising Heron's banking facilities.
It has also had access to the main details of the offer since the first
document was published five weeks ago.
The attitude of the bondholders is less predictable. It was their decision
last April - insisting that Heron make a payment previously defaulted on -
that precipitated the failure of the refinancing and the company being put
up for sale.
'We will definitely be analysing this document and letting bondholders know
exactly what they are getting out of this offer,' said Mr Gary Klesch,
managing director of Klesch &amp; Co, an investment group.
'It still doesn't look very attractive to us.'
However, there are signs here too of weary investors wanting it all to come
to some sort of conclusion. 'Heron has been leaking so much money in fees
while all this has been going on I'll be glad to get anything out of it,'
said one bondholder yesterday.
Privately both Heron and HNV are hoping, in the absence of more positive
approval, that the apathy factor will play an important part in gaining
approval.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Rise and fall of a colourful empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerald Ronson built up the Heron empire from the 1960s, first through a
move into petrol retailing and then into the UK property market in the
1970s. A colourful character, he was renowned for his charitable causes. He
moved into the US property and financial services businesses a decade later
and it was the decline in that market in the late 1980s which started
Heron's problems, writes Christopher Price.
Heron moved into the booming American thrift business - the equivalent of
British building societies - by buying Pima in the early 1980s. By 1984 Pima
was claimed to be the fastest-growing financial institution in its home
state of Arizona.
But from being potentially one of the group's biggest earners, Pima became a
huge drag on its finances. By 1989 the thrift industry had over-extended and
collapsed as ambitious borrowers got into difficulties. Pima began to cost
Heron some Pounds 40m a year: it was the business to which Guinness paid
much of the Pounds 5.8m for Heron's support in the Distillers bid. Heron
returned the money.
As debts mounted, Mr Ronson was forced to sell assets, a protracted affair
given the size and variety of his empire. The disposals included petrol
stations, video distribution, leisure interests and car distribution. This
culminated with the sale of the Heron Motor Group for Pounds 16m, leaving
just the property company.

</HEADLINE>

   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samax, which is developing a graphite mine in Tanzania and a gold mine in
Ghana, hopes to raise about Pounds 16m this month with an issue and placing
of new shares, which will be floated on the London Stock Exchange.
The company was set up in 1989 by Mr Michael Martineau, its managing
director, and Mr John Park, operations and finance director, who each have
more than 25 years experience in the minerals business, partly with British
Petroleum and more recently with Cluff Resources.
Samax's activities so far have been financed primarily by the Addax &amp; Oryx
Group, described in the pathfinder prospectus yesterday as a private,
Europe-based group involved in trading and related operations in Africa.
Addax will remain a substantial shareholder after the placing by
stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Mr Martineau said: 'The flotation will give Samax access to capital and a
higher profile. Exploration is the excitement for our future; our portfolio
is already valuable and a higher profile will increase the number of
projects offered to us.'
The prospectus says that both the graphite mine, at Merelani, some 14km
south west of Kilimanjaro airport in Tanzania, and the gold mine, at Prestea
in south west Ghana, are scheduled to begin commercial production in the
first half of 1995.
The pre-tax net present value of the group's interest in these mines is
calculated by independent consultants to be about Pounds 33m.
Samax also has interests in mineral exploration projects in Tanzania, Ghana,
Congo and Senegal. Mr Martineau said these projects were typically in areas
where there was previous evidence of gold mining and where there was
potential for economically recoverable reserves. Not enough work has been
done on these projects for any value to be ascribed to them.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Mid-States plans fund raising and US quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, has announced
plans to go ahead with a delayed issue of some Dollars 15m (Pounds 9.4m) in
new ordinary shares in the US along with the implementation of an American
Depositary Receipt programme. It also plans to list on Nasdaq to expand its
US shareholder base.
Shares in the company, which operates through its subsidiary Mid-State
Automotive Distributors of Nashville, Tennessee, rose 3p to 78p yesterday.
Mr Paul Dumond, company secretary, said the move to a US listing was because
of 'a general lack of interest from London investors in small US
businesses'. The company might also seek a full quote in London.
The funds raised from the US issue will be used to pay off bank debts of
Dollars 23m and to help the acquisition of distribution centres and retail
stores throughout the US. It bought two businesses in Mississippi for
Dollars 2.8m in April.
Mid-States also reported a 21 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the third
quarter to September 30, from Pounds 2m to Pounds 1.6m, Pounds 230,000 of
which was attributed to the losses in acquired businesses. Turnover
increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 17.1m).
In the nine months turnover improved 22 per cent to Pounds 58.7m (Pounds
48m) while pre-tax profits rose by just 5 per cent to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds
4.61m).
Earnings per share dropped to 2.7p (3.7p) in the quarter and to 7.4p (8.2p)
for the nine months after an increased tax charge. There has been no
dividend so far this year - a total of 0.75p was paid in 1993.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 5.2m purchase for Olives Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olives Property is continuing its restructuring with a further acquisition
and a rights issue.
The company yesterday announced it had agreed to buy a portfolio of
properties from Burford Holdings for Pounds 5.2m, of which Pounds 4.2m will
be paid in cash and the rest in shares.
The five retail warehouse and retail properties in the north west of
England, which are all let, produce a total rental income of Pounds 471,650
a year, representing a net initial yield of 8.8 per cent. Total rental
income, before the acquisition, was running at Pounds 1.86m a year, said Mr
Tony Grant, Olive's chairman and joint chief executive.
In May, the company completed a Pounds 10.3m rights issue with which it
acquired Huby Estates, a property investment concern in the north of
England, and Zincshire, a privately owned property investment company with
properties in Swindon and west London.
The latest buy will increase retail warehousing as a proportion of Olive's
portfolio from 3 per cent to 14 per cent. Net portfolio worth after the
acquisition will be Pounds 25m.
Olives recently reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 224,404 on turnover of
Pounds 753,558 for the six months to June 30. Net assets increased from
Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 15.5m, principally because of the rights issue.
Meanwhile, Olives announced it had appointed Mr Geoffrey Lawson to its board
as a non-executive director. Mr Lawson has extensive experience in the
property sector.

FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Danka advance 58% to
Pounds 21.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Danka Business Systems yesterday announced a 58 per cent rise in interim
pre-tax profits as the office equipment supplier continued its expansion
across the US.
The company, which is quoted in the UK but operates mainly in the US,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 13.3m) on turnover up 67
per cent to Pounds 236m (Pounds 141.1m) in the six months to September 30.
The sales increase was underpinned by 17 acquisitions costing Dollars 21m
(Pounds 13m) in the first half, and organic revenue growth of 14 per cent.
Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said Danka now held a 2.5 per cent market
share in both the US and the UK, with the latter expected to double in the
short-term. This year the company aims to establish operations in
continental Europe and expects a 5 per cent market share within five years.
'If you are operating in Houston or London, the copier industry worldwide is
absolutely standard. We feel our formula can be carried into any area,' he
said.
Overall profit margins were maintained as the company passed on
manufacturers' price increases of about 5 per cent.
Margins on which stand at roughly 50 per cent.
Supplies and maintenance accounts for almost half of turnover and the
company claims revenue of Dollars 1,200 a month from the latest generation
of colour copiers, compared with Dollars 80 from black-and-white copiers.
Customers typically sign a one-year maintenance contract, which can be
cancelled after three months' notice.
Net interest costs rose 46 per cent to Pounds 1.83m (Pounds 1.25m).
Long-term bank loans rose 42 per cent to Pounds 62.5m (Pounds 44.2m) at
September 30, when gearing stood at 134 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 7.5p (5.5p) and the interim dividend is 0.9p
(0.75p).
The company also announced the acquisition of American Business Equipment,
an Ohio distributor of Sharp equipment, for Dollars 7.6m satisfied by 1.62m
shares. American reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 1m on turnover of
Dollars 16m last year.
COMMENT
Danka has a consistent track record of boosting profits and turnover through
acquisitions in the fragmented US market. While the European photocopier
market is just as fragmented, few US companies have achieved growth on the
continent through acquisitions. Analysts forecast pre-tax profits ranging
from Pounds 41m to the house broker's Pounds 45m this year, but these could
fluctuate according to the strength of the dollar. The upper figure gives a
p/e of 19, which is high considering the risks of the expansion strategy.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Vestey buys back food interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vestey family is to buy back a large part of Union International, the
food processing and distribution group, as part of a restructuring of the
private Vestey food, shipping and property business empire.
Under the terms of a proposed deal, the Vestey Trust will acquire Union
International's food trading and distribution businesses in Australia and
Asia and its farming and property interests in Venezuela.
The deal, worth a maximum of Pounds 100m including up to Pounds 24m of
deferred payments for the Venezuelan property, paves the way for the
liquidation of Union International, a Vestey subsidiary which has been
operating under a standstill agreement with its banks pending debt
restructuring.
Union International is asking its banks to extend the standstill agreement
by six months to mid-1995 by which time the company is expected to have
eliminated its remaining debt and pushed ahead with the sale of its
remaining assets which include the Dewhurst, Matthew's and Baxter's butcher
shop chains, its British Beef businesses, its North American trading arm and
some property interests.
The operations being acquired by the Vestey Trust represent the core of
Union's food business with a combined profit before tax and interest of
Pounds 11.7m last year. In the first six months of this year their profit
contribution rose to Pounds 8.5m from Pounds 5.8m in 1993.
The Australian and Asian food operations are considered to have strong
potential and, together with the Frederick Leyland shipping business, will
form the basis of a slimmed-down Vestey empire.
The deal is subject to approval at a meeting of shareholders and preference
shareholders on November 18. The Vesteys own all of Union International's
ordinary shares and about a third of Union International's outstanding
preference shares so the outcome of the meeting is not in doubt.
The buy-back is a blow to Mr Terry Robinson, Union International's chief
executive, who had been seeking a management buyout. Under him, Union's
debts have been cut from a peak of Pounds 420m to Pounds 124.6m last year.

Ronson's private property company, have vowed to fight on against the
purchase plans by HNV Acquisition, the US investment group.
Following publication of the formal offer document, Mr Gary Klesch, managing
director of Klesch &amp; Co, which has been opposing the deal, said: 'This is
highly, highly, highly conditional. There's the litigations, the valuations
and other things besides. Nothing we have seen has changed our minds over
this deal.'
HNV, led by US investor Mr Steven Green, made its initial offer several
weeks ago, during which time the group and its advisers have been
negotiating with some of Heron's 82 creditor banks in order to gain
acceptance. The US group is offering Pounds 142m in cash to the banks and
bondholders who hold around Pounds 374m of debt.
Swiss Bank Corporation, HNV's bankers, has already secured the agreement of
around half of Heron's creditor bankers, which are owed some Pounds 200m.
Their debts are secured on properties in the UK and Spain. The document
shows the UK properties as having assets valued in excess of Pounds 200m.
However, the Spanish business has only net assets of Pounds 400,000. Under
the terms of the agreement, HNV will put up to Pounds 17m of capital into
the Spanish operations.
The document also shows Mr Ronson's salary package for the year to March 30
1994 at Pounds 1,049,000, down from Pounds 1,537,000 in 1993. Under last
September's refinancing, Mr Ronson agreed a five-year Pounds 800,000 per
annum salary package and the fall from the previous year reflects the lower
renumeration. Mr Ronson will continue as chief executive under the HNV plan,
a move which has caused some consternation, particularly among rebel
bondholders. 'I'm staggered by what they are continuing to pay that guy,'
said Mr Klesch.
Unusually, the offer document includes four pages of litigation in which
Heron is involved, including an Dollars 88m (Pounds 56m) lawsuit relating to
the group's ill-fated purchase of Pima, a US financial services group, and a
Dollars 39m suit outstanding brought by another US group, Stratagem. In all,
there are 16 outstanding litigation cases against Heron, or its directors.
Meetings have been set for the bondholders and banks to approve the HNV
offer. The banks are likely to be supportive, having approved HNV as the
preferred bidder last June, but the bondholders may not be. It was the
bondholders' decision last April to demand payments on their bonds that
forced Heron to seek a buyer.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Global problems follow LME to its new home / A look at the
market's rows with Chilean and Chinese customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two items of unfinished business failed to spoil the celebrations yesterday
as the London Metal Exchange started business in its new home. The LME
prides itself on being a truly global exchange and, as if to emphasise this
point, it finds itself in conflict with customers as far away as Chile and
China.
The difficulties go back to the turmoil in the LME's 'flagship' copper
contract last year. Prices slumped by one quarter in only five weeks,
reaching in May their lowest level for five and a half years. Then came a
severe supply 'squeeze' when, in spite of lacklustre world economic
conditions and LME copper stocks reaching a 15-year peak, the copper price
rose strongly. The LME board issued two public warnings about the squeeze
and eventually took emergency action to unwind it.
This was a market only for brave and truly professional traders. It was a
market of large profits and losses. Among the losers was Codelco
(Corporation Nacional del Cobre de Chile), the state-owned Chilean group.
Codelco says Mr Juan Pablo Davila, its chief futures trader, lost more than
Dollars 200m (Pounds 126m). Mr Davila and his two immediate superiors were
charged with deception and Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's president,
resigned. Codelco and the Chilean government want to lay further blame -
particularly in London's metal trading community.
Another loss-maker, Citic Shanghai, a subsidiary of China International
Trust and Investment Corporation, owes about Dollars 40m to LME brokers who
extended it credit and is claiming it cannot meet these debts in full.
The problems of both Codelco and Citic Shanghai can be traced to an esoteric
LME trading practice known in the jargon as 'carries at historical prices'.
In practice this means that, instead of paying up at the end of a contract,
it is rolled forward again but at the original price rather than the price
prevailing in the market. There are genuine reasons why some customers want
to make use of this system but traders suggest it can also be used to
disguise, temporarily, loss-making positions.
LME brokers prefer not to give these 'carries' because they tie up credit
lines and take some financing. So the service is provided only to
substantial customers with deep pockets. Both Codelco and Citic Shanghai
come into this category because they are state-owned and traders assume that
ultimately their governments stand behind them.
Codelco and the Chilean government have been excoriated by their domestic
press and have been pressing for the maximum punishment for those they claim
are responsible - without much luck so far. Mr Davila and his two superiors
were released from prison in May when the Santiago Appeals Court drastically
reduced the charges against them. No longer are they accused of defrauding
the state (maximum sentence five years) but instead are charged with causing
the company losses by deception (maximum sentence 541 days).
Meanwhile, Mr Juan Villarzu, Codelco's new president, says an investigation
by accountants Ernst and Young showed 'the existence of systematic deceit
aimed at distorting the economic outcome of copper futures transactions,
creating fictitious profits and postponing losses'. But he stressed this did
not necessarily mean that LME brokers had deliberately colluded with Mr
Davila. The LME has agreed to investigate 'unusual transactions' between
Codelco and several brokers.
At the LME's annual dinner last month, Mr Villarzu made it clear that he
feels there must have been some collusion between his company's trader and
some counter-parties in London. 'Had you the opportunity to examine the
trading contracts which Codelco entered into during 1993, you would have
been amazed at the number of transactions whose prices had no direct
relationship with the market prices ruling at the date and time of the
transaction,' he complained.
Mr Raj Bagri, LME chairman, promised that if any exchange member had
transgressed, 'we will not hesitate to take the appropriate action'.
However, he echoed other traders' assertions that poor management controls
were mainly responsible for Codelco's losses. Mr Bagri said the breakneck
speed at which derivatives and futures trading had taken root and spread
across the financial and commodity markets 'has in many instances left
managements far behind in having in place adequate, effective and timely
supervisory measures to monitor and control risks'. Nevertheless, the LME
hoped to implement by early next year measures 'to limit any perceived
dangers of historical price carries'.
Opinion is split among LME members about whether incidents such as these
involving Citic and Codelco are damaging to the exchange's image.
Yesterday's move to another premises in London's financial district was in
part prompted by a fourfold increase in turnover in the past six years. So
the LME - trading primary aluminium, aluminium alloy, lead, nickel, tin and
zinc as well as copper - is now the second-largest futures exchange in the
UK and the seventh largest in the world. It will trade futures and options
valued at nearly Dollars 2,000bn this year.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Three Baby Bell companies form US cable TV venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The convergence of telecommunications and cable TV took a further step in
the US yesterday with the formation of a joint venture between three
regional Baby Bell telephone companies and a leading programming agency.
Bell Atlantic, Nynex and Pacific Telesis said they were each investing
Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) over the next three years in a venture including
Mr Michael Ovitz's Creative Artists Agency.
The partners, who claim to reach 30m homes in the US, said they would
establish two new companies, one handling programming and the other
technology. The first, provisionally known as the media company, will begin
by buying programmes to feed through the partners' cable network, then
develop its own programmes. It will also produce video on demand, and
finally interactive programmes such as home shopping and games.
The technology company will develop systems and standards for the new
venture. It will receive existing technical assets from the three partners,
such as Bell Atlantic's digital imaging laboratory in Reston, Virginia. Such
assets will form part of the Dollars 100m contribution from each Baby Bell
partner.
Under US legislation, there are restrictions on local telephone companies
entering the cable market and vice versa. However, several states have
recently relaxed these regulations. The partners denied yesterday that the
venture faced any regulatory problems.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex cover the north eastern seaboard of the US, while
Pacific Telesis is based in California. The media company will be based in
Los Angeles and New York, while the technology company will operate from San
Francisco and Reston, Virginia. The partners denied that there was any
intention to move towards a full merger. However, Bell Atlantic and Nynex
already have close ties in mobile telephony, and 10 days ago formed a
partnership to bid for new personal communication service (PCS) licences
along with two other regional companies.
The partners said commercial trials for video on demand would begin in 1995.
Eventually, the venture would offer advanced interactive services such as
on-line games for numerous players, personal news services and interactive
advertising.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Manweb's finance director leaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manweb, the Chester-based electricity distribution company, yesterday
announced the sudden resignation of Mr John Astall, its finance director.
In a brief statement to the stock exchange, the company said that Mr Astall
'has today, by mutual agreement, tendered his resignation as a director with
immediate effect'. Mr Astall, 44, will leave the company at the end of
November, and an announcement regarding his successor will be made in due
course.
It is understood that Mr Astall, who was part way through a rolling
three-year contract, will not receive any compensation. His 90,000 share
options have also been cancelled.
The news hit the Manweb share price. After registering a 12p advance, it
slipped to close 4p up on the day at 807p.
A spokesman said that there was 'nothing sinister' in the resignation. He
commented that Mr Astall, who joined the company three years ago from a
subsidiary of Vickers, the engineering group, was from a different cultural
environment and 'did not sit comfortably with the Manweb way of doing
things'. In the circumstances, Manweb had decided that 'a quick clean break
is the best way to go about it,' he said.
He stressed that there had been no falling out over strategy, and he also
denied rumours that Mr Astall's personal conduct had been the cause of his
resignation.
The resignation came as a surprise to analysts who said that Mr John
Roberts, the chief executive, and Mr Astall had frequently appeared together
when presenting the company's results.
'They were seen as a family, a close-knit team,' said one of them. 'It seems
strange that they should suddenly have a cultural falling-out.'
There were no big strategic issues facing Manweb which could have created a
division among top executives. Manweb has a policy of concentrating on its
core business of electricity distribution.
In its latest financial year, Manweb raised its profits by 14 per cent to
Pounds 126m pre-tax, on turnover up from Pounds 920m to Pounds 930m. It is
due to announce its interim results on December 14.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Japan 'over worst' of bad-debt crisis: Central bank governor
hails progress in lifting bad loans burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The protracted bad-debt crisis experienced by Japan's banks appeared to be
past its worst, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said
yesterday.
In a speech at the bank's Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Mr
Mieno, who retires next month after five years as head of the central bank,
said banks had made significant progress towards lifting the burden of bad
debts produced by the collapse of property and other asset prices in the
past few years.
Mr Mieno has raised eyebrows in financial circles in the past six months
with his insistently upbeat assessments of Japan's economic prospects.
Yesterday that optimism was focused on the overall health of the banking
system, though he criticised banks for their slowness in facing up to their
bad debts.
'We may no longer have to be concerned about how much further the problem of
non-performing assets is going to develop since the outline of the problem
has now become fairly clear,' Mr Mieno said. The bad-debt burden has made
Japanese banks wary of new lending, in particular, in the international
market.
Mr Mieno was careful to avoid claiming that the total number of bad loans
had peaked, stating only that the 'pace of increase in non-performing loans'
seems to have slowed.
Figures published in the banks' annual reports in May supported the
proposition that the total had peaked. Disclosed bad loans at the nation's
21 largest commercial banks fell by 1.3 per cent between September 1993 and
March this year to Y13,600bn (Pounds 85.85bn).
But these figures include only loans to bankrupt companies and loans in
arrears by six months or more. In Japan, unlike most other countries, banks
are not obliged to give figures for loans where interest rates have been cut
to keep a borrower afloat, nor those on which no interest has been paid for
up to six months.
Most analysts estimate that adding in these loans would almost double the
bad loan book, and would suggest that the total is still rising.
Mr Mieno said the banks' reluctance to acknowledge and write off
non-performing loans had delayed improvements in balance sheets. He added
that the delay may have had a negative effect on the macroeconomy.
The governor said it was necessary to strengthen Japan's financial system by
promoting faster deregulation, and by encouraging banks to be more
innovative and to discard their natural tendency not to step out of line
with each other.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fees for refinancing near-bankrupt Heron International have reached an
astonishing Pounds 60m. Bondholders, who saw most of their investment wiped
out in last year's failed restructuring and will face a further diminution
if the latest plan is approved, must feel bitter. A particularly gripe - as
with other refinancings such as Queens Moat Houses - is that some fees have
gone to Heron's bank creditors. It seems inappropriate for one class of
creditors to receive fees from a struggling company, so reducing what is
available for the rest.

FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Preferred securities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For Grand Metropolitan, the benefits of its Dollars 500m issue of preferred
securities are clear. The cleverly-structured issue is in line with the
group's strategy of reducing its dependence on short-term debt. The cost of
financing the new instrument is likely to be 40-50 basis points higher than
that of 30-year debt - a price well worth paying for an instrument which
approximates to equity, and is viewed as such by the rating agencies.
Moreover, the securities enhance accounting measurements of performance such
as interest cover and gearing while being tax-efficient. Despite the
instrument's attractions, preferred securities are aimed primarily at US
retail investors. The appeal of the financing technique to other UK blue
chip companies may thus be limited to those such as GrandMet whose products
are already familiar to the US consumer.

FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Creating a level regulatory playing field for banks and investment groups
throughout the European Union is a laudable ambition. But the capital
adequacy directive, due to take effect in just 14 months, is flawed. One
problem is that the directive fails to achieve its main objective of
ensuring fair competition between non-bank investment groups and banks'
securities subsidiaries. The banks' securities businesses will still be
subsidised by cheap capital from deposit bases  - less costly because, in
the last resort, they are guaranteed by governments.
Worse, the new regulations distort the market. The capital requirements for
securities will, on occasions, be 32 times less than for loans with similar
risk, so banks will be encouraged to develop securitised lending over
traditional loans. This was gradually happening anyway, but it remains
un-satisfactory that a significant acceleration should be the unintended
result of regulation rather than market forces.
The directive's eventual impact will depend on the authorities'
interpretation and implemention. The UK looks set to reinforce its record of
adopting a legalistic, hair-shirt approach to European legislation through
'super-compliance' - insisting on capital adequacy and documentation even
greater than that required by the directive. This would increase costs and
disadvantage London as a financial centre. Within the directive, there is
scope for discretion. The industry's regulatory bodies should use it.

FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Milk Marque
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The move today to a new marketing regime for UK milk parallels the
experience of eastern European countries forced to switch overnight from
central planning to a free market. The transformation will be traumatic, and
the consequences will be unfathomable.
In the short term, the impact of the change on big dairy companies such as
Unigate and Northern Foods looks wholly negative. Milk prices will rise and
the food processors will find it impossible to pass the full increase in raw
materials costs to customers. This is especially true for products such as
cream, yoghurt, cheese, butter and milk powder, where the ready availability
of imports will limit manufacturers' scope to pass on cost increases of up
to 20 per cent. Fresh milk is not threatened to the same degree by imports,
and the dairies have already pushed through higher prices. Despite Tesco's
decision to mark up the price of milk by 2p a pint as of today, the brunt of
the price rises will fall on consumers who have their milk delivered at
home. Higher prices for the traditional pinta will accelerate the sharp
decline in this high-margin segment of the market.
Long term, the Milk Marque regime may benefit the larger dairy groups. They
will get greater flexibility in the sourcing of milk. They will seize the
opportunity to rationalise their manufacturing operations, for example, by
cutting excess capacity. But the transition to a new order is likely to be a
turbulent one, and during that transition shares in Unigate or Northern
Foods will tempt only the brave.

FT  01 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Kicking tobacco
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nine years after RJR bought Nabisco and five years after the combined entity
was acquired by KKR in a massive leveraged buy-out, RJR Nabisco appears to
be returning to its roots. Yesterday's announcement of a partial float for
Nabisco could mark the start of a split into its original food and tobacco
divisions. Meanwhile, RJR's decision not to take part in KKR's Dollars 2bn
bid for Borden, a food group, looks like an assertion of independence from
the buy-out group.
RJR Nabisco's rating has been tainted by its perception as a tobacco stock -
something re-emphasised by yesterday's go-ahead by a judge for a class
action by smokers in Florida. By giving the food side greater visibility,
the partial float should benefit both Nabisco and its parent. If it can be
ring-fenced from tobacco liabilities, Nabisco should find it easier to raise
debt and ultimately equity for acquisitions. RJR will be hoping its own
rating will be boosted by Nabisco's higher valuation, since it will still
own 80 per cent of the company.
By backing out of the Borden bid, RJR has caused KKR something of a
headache. Under the original deal, a complicated share swap between Borden
and RJR would have have reduced KKR's costs and enabled the transfer of
assets to RJR. There was also the possibility that Nabisco could have helped
KKR manage Borden, which has had a poor record in recent years. One might
have thought that KKR, which owns 35 per cent of RJR Nabisco, would have
been in a position to tell the group what to do. But, with that stake
halving as part of the Borden bid, that is presumably no longer the case.

FT  01 NOV 94 / MPs call for stronger controls on out-of-town superstores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further construction of out-of-town shopping centres and superstores should
be restricted to protect the environment, a report by an all-party Commons
select committee is expected to recommend today.
The findings by the House of Commons Environment Committee will mark another
attack on large developments in the countryside, which encourage greater use
of cars by locating shops far away from residential areas.
Last week the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution proposed doubling
petrol tax and halving spending on new roads in an effort to avoid
unacceptable environmental damage in the early decades of the next century.
The environment select committee's inquiry, Shopping Centres and their
Future, began in the spring and will call for stronger curbs against
out-of-town developments which take trade away from existing town centres.
It recommends that planning guidance issued by the government be amended 'to
include a presumption that superstores are best located in or on the edge of
town centres unless there are very strong indications to the contrary'.
This proposal would go further than a guidance note issued to local planning
authorities last July by the Environment Department, stressing the
importance of stemming the decline of town centres by encouraging high
street development. This said that out-of-town developments should not be
refused, 'unless there is clear evidence to suggest that the result would be
to undermine the vitality and viability of that (town) centre'.
If adopted, the select committee's proposals would add to the pressure on
large retailers, which have been finding it increasingly difficult to
receive planning permission for out-of-town sites since the guidance note
was issued.
Tesco, the UK's second-largest supermarket group, says that while it used to
win about 60 per cent of planning cases that went to appeal, the percentage
has dropped to 10 or 15 since last year's guidance note.
The UK's three largest food retailers, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Argyll, owner
of Safeway, have recently cut back out-of-town expansion in favour of town
centre developments.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of the grocery chain, said recently: 'We are
now taking a different view about the closure of town centre stores,
believing that by remodelling and refurbishing these stores, we can give
them a new lease of life. We also believe that as an industry we should seek
to locate more of our stores near high streets while making certain that
they have good car parking.'
The select committee's recommendations are likely to be welcomed by
environmental groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural
England, which has lobbied for stricter controls on out-of-town development.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A competitive defence base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
From the British Ministry of Defence comes the sound of arms being heavily
twisted. Both British Aerospace and GEC are lobbying hard for their
respective bids for the VSEL submarine yard in Barrow to receive official
backing. BAe's case is that, since it does not currently own a shipyard, its
bid presents no competition difficulties. However, it thinks that GEC's bid
would generate an unnecessary monopoly, since GEC owns Yarrow on the Clyde,
the only other big warship yard in the UK.
GEC argues that, in practice, the pattern of warship orders likely over the
next 10 years means that there would be little competition even if the two
yards were owned by different companies. It therefore makes little
difference if the two yards are owned by one company.
The ministry of defence's position is disturbingly obscure. It has quite
rightly championed the cause of competition in defence procurement for the
past decade, saying that the policy is 'fundamental to achieving value for
money'. Until recently it was also saying privately that it would not look
favourably on a GEC bid for VSEL for precisely those reasons.
As soon as the bids appeared, however, the ministry became coy. All it will
say is that the issue will be decided by the competition authorities - in
this case the Office of Fair Trading - and that its submissions to the OFT
will be confidential. Yet since the MoD is the only UK defence customer, its
view will decide the issue. So, unhappily, secret submissions to the OFT
may, or may not, mask a policy shift on competition in procurement.
Monopoly supplier
In deciding its position the ministry will have to weigh the extent to which
the necessary consolidation of the defence industry following the end of the
cold war should be balanced against maintaining as much competition as
possible. In the narrow case of the bids for VSEL, the case for a reduction
in competition is not obvious. Since GEC will undoubtedly have to guarantee
the future of both yards, creating a monopoly supplier will not lead to
rationalisation and cost savings. The MoD thus has little reason to upend
its arguments in favour of maintaining competition by allowing the GEC bid
to proceed.
The underlying problem is that the MoD, rather than seizing the initiative,
is allowing defence competition policy to evolve in a purely reactive
fashion. The rapid decline in US and European defence spending requires a
drastic change in the structure of defence industries. This is already
happening in the US, but is proving regrettably slow to materialise in
Europe, largely because European governments are reluctant to allow
cross-border rationalisation.
Uniquely placed
The UK is uniquely well placed to influence this process. If it chose, it
could argue strongly with other EU governments for a more open market for
Europe's defence manufacturers, giving them the freedom to choose how to
rationalise in a market almost as large as that of the US. Instead, the MoD
has sat back and argued that the market should decide.
The trouble is that the market in defence procurement is far from free. If
it were, many companies would probably opt to rationalise within business
sectors. That might produce fewer, Europe-wide missile, aircraft and
electronics manufacturers, rather than thinly-spread national companies.
Provided such specialist companies were prepared to follow commercial logic
in their rationalisation, as opposed to political pressure, they could
operate at lower cost than national defence champions. They might also
become genuinely competitive against the giant US firms now emerging, in
contrast with the current situation in which uncompetitive and
under-resourced national companies are awarded contracts for purely
political ends.
The MoD's competition policy over the past 10 years points clearly towards a
rationalised European defence industry with increasing two-way competition
between US and European products. The risk of the current drift in UK policy
is that ad hoc decisions on specific cases will give rise to an
ill-conceived, nationally-based industrial structure. This will neither give
the MoD best value for money nor be able to compete successfully on the
world stage.

<TEXT>
In a week's time, Americans will go to the polls after the most
mean-spirited mid-term elections in living memory. The signs are that,
thanks to President Bill Clinton's recent successes abroad, the outcome for
the Democratic party will be less cataclysmic than many feared. But the
Congress that emerges looks unlikely to be equal to the challenges facing
the country in the years ahead.
A month ago, many were predicting historic victories for the Republican
party in the elections on November 8. Party leaders spoke, not only of
regaining control of the Senate, but of overturning the Democrats'
50-year-old majority in the House of Representatives. The elections, they
claimed, had become a national referendum on Mr Clinton, and the president -
and his party - were losing.
Mr Clinton's creditable showing in the Middle East and elsewhere appears to
have turned the anti-Democratic tide a little. But it is a reflection of the
low expectations surrounding the campaign that retaining control of the
House - if not the Senate - would now be seen as something of a victory for
the Democrat camp.
It is hard to pin the voters' discontent on the economy. Three and a half
years into recovery, the country is materially better off than it has been
for some time. Yet rather than reward Democrats for this performance, the
electorate has seemed determined to punish them for the government's
inability to solve the country's deeper social problems, such as the high
crime rate and the dismal state of the inner cities.
Anti-government mood
In the face of this anti-government mood, Mr Clinton has increasingly turned
towards foreign policy in recent months: the one domain in which government
activism is not now associated with failure. Candidates in the field have
not had this option. For the most part, they have simply been driven to
trying to convince voters that they are as down on Washington as the country
at large is.
Clearly, incumbent Democrat senators and congressmen fare poorly in such an
uncompromising climate. But so does anyone with a moderate, more pragmatic,
conception, of what government might hope to achieve through social and
other legislation. In many regions, the candidates that have thrived have
been those on the extreme right, who reject moderate solutions out of hand.
Bipartisan coalitions
This kind of polarisation was already much in evidence this summer, in the
Republicans' comprehensive blocking of health care legislation. But, judged
by the campaign, the 104th Congress will be even less inclined to form
bipartisan coalitions to get legislation passed.
What does this imply for the rest of the world? In the short term, the
events of the past few months make it even more crucial that the 'lame-duck'
sitting of the current Congress, in the period just after the election, is
able to ratify the outcome of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt. Whatever the
difficulties this presents, mustering the required votes next year could be
harder still.
In the longer term, there is still a chance that Mr Clinton will return to
the question of health care reform. But he will have little chance of
passing the kind of comprehensive reform he promised in 1992. More
incremental measures may be possible, along, perhaps, with a package of
welfare reforms which might muster sufficient Respublican support.
The true casualty of these elections, however, is the prospect for reforms
in areas of US government which require more ambitious bipartisan
coalition-building in Congress: above all, the country's bloated system of
entitlements. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats have proposed
suggestions for reforming that system during the campaign which make any
sense. Yet without fundamental - and politically unpopular - tax increases
and cuts in spending, the federal budget deficit will begin to rise again in
only a few years time.
The US electorate has spent recent months bemoaning the failings of 'big'
government. For all that, they seem determined to elect a new Congress which
is singularly ill-equipped, either to make it any better, or to make it any
smaller.

FT  01 NOV 94 / A turn for the worse in Bosnia: Bruce Clark explains the UN
dilemma and the diplomatic disarray provoked by the Moslem army offensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever the fighting in former Yugoslavia subsides, more comfortable parts
of the world forget about it with relief. They have largely done so since
February, when a ceasefire brought a minimum of normality to Sarajevo.
But in the last few days, that complacency has been shattered. In its most
spectacular offensive since the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina began nearly three
years ago, the Moslem-led government army has burst out of its position near
the enclave of Bihac and captured over 100 square miles of territory.
It has put to flight thousands of Serb soldiers and civilians, and
threatened the Serb-held towns of Bosanska Krupa and Bosanski Petrovac.
There have also been Bosnian government offensives to the south and west of
Sarajevo, and in retaliation the city's suburbs have again been shelled.
UN peacekeepers have come under shellfire from government soldiers who
refuse to leave the strategic Mount Igman, outside Sarajevo. From the Serbs,
they have faced kidnappings and the obstruction of fuel deliveries to
eastern Bosnia.
UN officials - who need a minimum of co-operation from all parties to
function effectively - admit to being near the the end of their tether. Yet
winding down their giant operation in former Yugoslavia, which involves
40,000 troops from 36 countries, may turn out to be more disastrous than
retaining it.
'Our peacekeeping effort has continually been tested by the warring parties,
and in recent weeks the conflict has intensified,' says Mr Michael Williams,
chief spokesman for the UN in Zagreb.
In theory, the peacekeeping operation was given more teeth by the UN, which
last week agreed tougher procedures for air strikes with Nato, which is
responsible for policing the Bosnian skies. But Nato's insistence that any
bombing raids be on a much larger scale than before could make UN commanders
more reluctant to invoke air power. And it would be almost impossible
politically to use Nato aircraft against the Bosnian government army, which
enjoys strong US support.
In the diplomatic arena the picture is scarcely more encouraging, with
divisions between the five nations in the international contact group on
Bosnia which is leading efforts to arrange a peaceful settlement. The key to
progress was supposed to be the unity of the group's members: the US,
Russia, the UK, France and Germany.
But now they are divided over a US-sponsored resolution in the UN Security
Council that would authorise arms supplies to Bosnia in six months - unless
the Serbs accept a peace plan. If the resolution is pushed to a vote, it
will be blocked by UK and French abstentions and possibly a Russian veto.
Worse diplomatic disarray has been avoided with the dropping of Washington's
demand for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia. But the
ability of the five to act together with credibility has already been
compromised.
Both the renewed fighting, and the crumbling of international consensus,
bring closer the spectre that haunts every actor in the Bosnian drama: a UN
pull-out in what military planners euphemistically describe as 'non-benign'
conditions - under fire from one or more of the warring factions. Nato's
plans for this scenario run to thousands of pages; they remain secret, but
are assumed to envisage hundreds of casualties and the temporary deployment
of up to 20,000 extra ground forces to cover the withdrawal.
It is hard to imagine how Nato could assemble such numbers at speed without
including some US troops. It is, however, even harder to imagine how the US
could agree to the inclusion of their armed forces in view of the American
electorate's acute reluctance to accept losses in foreign wars.
Either way, a bloody withdrawal from Bosnia could shake both transatlantic
relations, and the international order, to their foundations. This, in turn,
would cloud prospects for concerted diplomatic action over a host of other
regional problems, from Iraq to Indochina.
The pull-out of UN peacekeepers could also leave behind a bloodbath in
Bosnia in which the death toll would far exceed the 200,000 or so already
chalked up.
If the events of recent days do portend a serious turn for the worse, it is
quite possible - strange as this may sound - that historians will view the
last eight months as a period of success in international policy towards the
region.
While each of the outside powers involved in Bosnia has its own strategic
aims, there are four goals to which all are committed:
The prevention of a humanitarian catastrophe by distributing aid, and
sheltering civilians from the worst effects of the war.
The geographical containment of the fighting, so that it does not spread
through ex-Yugoslavia and the Balkans.
The avoidance of any breakdown in relations between the world's leading
powers because of disagreement over Bosnia.
The creation, if possible, of conditions for a long-term settlement which is
viable and not too unjust.
The four objectives have been difficult to pursue simultaneously, because
they often point in contradictory directions. It is not possible, for
example, to feed civilians without feeding armies, which prolongs the
fighting.
However, if there is no progress towards the fourth aim of a settlement, the
successes on the first two will be compromised, because the political will
to maintain the huge humanitarian relief effort and vigorous preventive
diplomacy will start to flag. Conversely, if one outside power intervenes
unilaterally to promote the fourth goal - by altering the battle lines and
imposing what it considers to be a just outcome - the other three goals
could be left in ruins.
That is what the British, French and Russians will be telling the US at this
week's Security Council debate: far from bringing peace to Bosnia, the
creation of a 'level killing field' through arms deliveries to the Bosnian
government could trigger a new humanitarian nightmare and bitter
international recrimination.
Compared with the disasters which might have occurred, the world community
has achievements to its credit, at least on the first three goals. With the
completion last week of the 10,000th aid flight to Sarajevo, the UN can
point to some success in meeting the first objective.
There has also been success on the second front: thanks to (mainly US)
diplomacy, the Serb-Moslem stand-off in Bosnia has not so far triggered an
even bigger conflict to the south between the Serbs and the mainly Moslem
Albanians.
Last July, when the five contact group nations threw their weight behind a
new peace plan for Bosnia, they were ostensibly pursuing the fourth
objective, a long-term settlement. Yet in practice, the peace plan - which
would allocate 51 per cent of Bosnia's territory to a Moslem-Croat
federation and the rest to the Serbs - had much more to do with the third
goal of maintaining international consensus.
Rather than having any practical effect, the peace proposal has served as a
kind of totem to which all the outside powers can pay homage, and a standard
by which the good intentions of the parties on the ground can be judged.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has emerged triumphantly from
opprobrium by accepting the plan, while his rival, the Bosnian Serb leader
Mr Radovan Karadzic, has fallen further into disrepute by saying no.
Few close observers of the conflict see the slightest chance of the warring
parties agreeing to implement the plan, which would require the Bosnian
Serbs to give up 20 per cent of the land they have staked out and largely
'ethnically cleansed' of non-Serbs.
Bosnia's Moslem leaders have accepted the map, albeit reluctantly. But they
admit that they have accepted it only because they see no risk of having to
implement it: their Serb adversaries were always bound to say no.
There is little prospect that outside powers will come up with a new map.
The best hope is that the parties will agree among themselves on adjusting
the plan, after exhausting all military options.
But even if the contact group's peace plan is dead, there have been some
encouraging hints of progress towards a comprehensive settlement in the
former Yugoslavia.
One sign is the covert diplomacy that has been going on since the summer,
including a secret meeting between army commanders from Belgrade and Zagreb.
Efforts towards a peace settlement in Croatia - based on full diplomatic
recognition between Belgrade and Zagreb, and some autonomy for the
Serb-dominated areas of Croatia - appear to be moving into higher gear.
After months of intricate negotiations, involving the US and Russian
embassies in Zagreb and envoys of the European Union and the UN, it was
announced last week that Zagreb and Belgrade will hold regular meetings at
foreign minister level.
Serb-Croat reconciliation does not automatically bring peace in Bosnia
closer. Whenever Serbs and Croats talk, the Moslems become nervous, on the
understandable ground that the most likely subject of these discussions is
carving up Bosnia.
But for the present, the Croat-Moslem federation agreement stitched together
last February under strong international pressure is holding. In Mostar,
which had its Moslem eastern half subjected to a ruthless siege by the
Croats last year, about 30 hard-pressed bureaucrats from the EU are working,
with modest success, to promote reconciliation and ensure that basic
municipal functions are carried out.
In return for international respectability, Croatia's leaders have set aside
aspirations to carve out a slice of Bosnia for themselves. President
Milosevic, for similar reasons, seems willing in principle to recognise the
territorial integrity of both Bosnia and Croatia.
Advances such as these have made the recent French proposal for a meeting
between the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia more plausible. This
would not mean an instant end to all fighting; but if it allowed the broad
lines of a settlement in former Yugoslavia to be laid out, it would be a big
step forward. At the very least, the diplomatic efforts of recent months
have put in place building bricks for a settlement to be constructed.
The latest upsurge in fighting might scupper that process. However, it might
just conceivably help it along. The Bosnian Serbs' current reverses could
make them more willing to sue for peace on terms acceptable to the rest of
the world.
Some observers in Belgrade believe that Mr Milosevic would not be too
unhappy to see the power base of his rival, Mr Karadzic, confined to eastern
Bosnia. This could happen if the Bosnian Serbs continued to suffer military
defeats in the far north of the republic, and the political friends of Mr
Milosevic gained the upper hand in the Serbs' stronghold of Banja Luka.
A bleaker scenario, however, is that the Bosnian Serbs will be so badly
humiliated that politicians in Belgrade, and perhaps Moscow, find themselves
under irresistible moral pressure to come to their aid.
Since his apparent conversion to the cause of a peaceful settlement last
August, Mr Milosevic has used his authoritarian state machine, and his
control of the media, to insulate himself from nationalist pressures to
support the Bosnian Serbs. But the commanders of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
army may not be prepared to stand by indefinitely if their brother officers
in the Bosnian Serb forces are subjected to a series of humiliating
setbacks.
Another imponderable is the political balance in Russia, where the
government might be tempted into pursuing a more stridently pro-Serb policy
as a way of parrying hard-line nationalist opposition to its economic
programme.
That would end all hope of keeping the contact group together. The outside
powers involved in Bosnia might then find the only thing they could agree on
was the level of military support each gave to its own friends: the US to
the Bosnian government, the Russians to the Serbs.
The last such agreement was in 1989, when Presidents Bush and Gorbachev
settled on the deadly principle of 'positive symmetry' - or balanced arms
supplies to their proteges - in Afghanistan.
As a means of settling a civil war, that is not a happy precedent. While the
deal helped take the Afghan issue off the international agenda, it also
stoked the fighting that reduced much of Kabul to smouldering rubble. And
unlike the conflict in Afghanistan, an escalating war by proxy in the former
Yugoslavia would be hard to restrict to a single country.

Mohamed Fayed's war with John Major's government has the oddest
consequences.
Many of Westminster's well-heeled Tory MPs might expect to do some Christmas
shopping at Harrods, the famous Knightsbridge store. Which is of course
owned by Fayed. Hardly the done thing, perhaps, to be spotted crossing
Harrods's threshold at the moment. It might be construed as an act of gross
disloyalty to the prime minister.

When will the Prudential, Britain's biggest life insurer, end its splendid
isolation and apply to join the Personal Investment Authority along with the
rest of the UK life insurance industry?
The question is prompted by the news that Sir Martin Jacomb, a member of the
City's great and good, is expected to take over as chairman of the Pru next
year. Sir Martin is a director of the Bank of England and a former deputy
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, and can generally be
relied upon to toe the establishment line.
Sir Martin was a member of the board when the Pru insisted on exercising its
right to be directly regulated by the Securities and Investments Board and
the Pru does not sound as though it is bracing itself for a shift. Even so
if the Pru is a member of the PIA a year from now it will be a sure sign
that its robust chief executive Mick Newmarch is no longer being allowed to
have it all his own way.

Running a company during a heated takeover battle sure is stressful. It
seems to have taken a particularly tough toll on Drew Lewis, chairman of
Union Pacific, battling to win control of rival US railroad operator Santa
Fe Pacific.
On Sunday, after raising its bid for Santa Fe to Dollars 3.8bn to top
Burlington Northern's rival offer of Dollars 3.2bn, Union Pacific announced
that Lewis, a former transportation secretary in the Reagan administration,
is taking a leave of four to six weeks to enter an alcohol-treatment
programme.
Will this affect the outcome of the bid struggle? Union Pacific will clearly
miss him; no fewer than three senior executives are taking on Lewis's duties
in his absence.

Something seismic seems to be under way in London. First some areas round
Heathrow start to collapse, resulting in underground trains not stopping at
terminal four for the next few weeks.
Now one of London's best-known landmarks, Big Ben, has slipped, albeit
almost imperceptibly. A 3mm shift on the clock's east face has been detected
by electronic sensors, caused by the natural sway of tall buildings and by
tidal movements on the river Thames.
With all this talk of (metaphorical) cracks appearing in the fabric of the
UK establishment, it's just a trifle spooky to see some real ones too.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Observer: Steady Eddie vs Villains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When will Britain next raise its interest rates? The financial markets were
badly caught out by September's rise - so they will be watching tomorrow's
meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, and the Bank of
England's Eddie George with more than usual interest.
But City analysts might just as well look to football team Aston Villa's
score sheet for guidance, judging by Eddie George's comments to a CBI dinner
in Birmingham last week.
The Bank's economists appear to have moved on from testing correlations
between productivity in the Black Country and the performance of the
region's premier football team. They are now concentrating on the influence
of the Villains (as the team is known) on UK monetary policy.
Three years ago, Eddie George's predecessor noted that he had reduced
interest rates more times than Villa had won home games. Now George has
hinted there will be no interest rate rise until Villa wins a home game.
Assuming tonight's match (against Trabzonspor) does not count - because it
is a non-league game - the next key date is Sunday, when Villa meets
Manchester United. On past form that should mean little chance of any
monetary tightening for at least a week.
Then again, as Goldman Sachs' Gavyn Davies found to his cost seven weeks
ago, sticking one's neck out on interest rates can be a foolish business
when dealing with Steady Eddie.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unwelcome local surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE HANCOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are quite right to report that the Local Government Commission's
proposal for a unitary council for the New Forest came as a surprise - an
unwelcome surprise.
Your report perhaps lets us guess at how the commission came to make what,
on any reasoned consideration of the facts, seems completely the wrong
decision.
You report Sir John Banham, the commission chairman, as saying that members
were swayed by 'overwhelming support for a unitary authority independent of
Hampshire, with 60 per cent of residents in the New Forest in favour of this
option'. He must have meant 'respondents' - those writing to the commission
with views - because there is no 'overwhelming support'.
About 6 per cent of the New Forest electorate sent comments to the
commission. Some 4,700 people, 3.5 per cent of the electorate, supported the
commission's second-choice for an all-unitary structure of local government
replacing county and district councils throughout Hampshire. A separate
survey for the commission showed, from a sample of New Forest residents,
that a third wanted no change and only 37 per cent, not 60 per cent, wanted
a unitary structure.
The changes proposed by the commission would add up to Pounds 5m a year,
every year, to the cost of running local government in Hampshire. That is
what it costs to run two big secondary schools a year. On top of that,
council taxpayers would have to find up to Pounds 12m to pay the one-off
costs of making the change. That is more or less what it costs to build a
new secondary school. And the commission's report accepts the problems the
councils will face in trying to prevent service quality falling.
If Sir John and the commission have so misinterpreted the data before them,
it is no wonder we have a recommendation which many Hampshire residents find
so unacceptable.
The simple facts are that of the 55,000 comments made to the commission,
more than half supported the commission's earlier proposal for no change
except in Portsmouth and Southampton. Another 8,500 wanted no change at all.
That, Sir John, is the voice of the clear majority]

leader,
Hampshire County Council,
The Castle,

FT  01 NOV 94 / High noon for the media
</HEADLINE>

One day our elected representatives will decide that Britain's newspapers
and broadcasters are getting too big for their boots. The worms will turn.
We may then see a protracted struggle, as with the trade unions in the
1980s, designed to put the media in their place. A future government - it
could be the Conservatives, but it is more likely to be Labour - might
manipulate cross-ownership rules, codify the activities of self-regulatory
bodies, impose a right of reply, or introduce laws safeguarding individual
privacy and imposing severe penalties for journalists who obtain information
by deception. Blueprints for such legal weapons, and others, lie in
Whitehall files. Their deployment is the stuff of politicians' everyday
fantasies. Only the courage is lacking.
Not everyone sees a need to crunch us. The most skilful practitioners
understand that we are easily seduced. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, is
a sophisticate who knows how to influence reporters and commentators alike.
So do some Conservative bigwigs such as the foreign secretary and the
chancellor, neither of whom could argue convincingly that the prime minister
is a consummate master of the art. Against that, your average
run-of-the-mill Labour politician deeply mistrusts the media. Most
Conservative members of parliament are angered by what they regard as its
muck-raking.
Certain ministers are afraid of what we might say, some of them with reason.
Since Mr John Major became prime minister his colleagues have clunked over
like ninepins, usually following the publication of details about this or
that lapse and always after a period during which No 10 Downing Street had
intimated that so-and-so had the personal backing of the PM. One or two were
fired simply because they were bad at their jobs. I would not seek to
differentiate between these categories. Most of those concerned were small
fry, their ill fortune best forgotten. Yet some - Mellor, Lamont, Patten, to
take but three - live on in our memories.
What links them all, sharks and piranhas alike, is that they can be said to
have been 'brought down by the media.' I place the phrase in quotation
marks, because it was of course their own behaviour, or inept management of
their departments, that destroyed their careers. It is true that Mr Major's
main excuse for dismissing Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor was the latter's
lack of presentational skills, but that is an exception. The junior
ministers lost to the public service over the past fortnight were
undoubtedly dismissed by the media. The first resigned voluntarily,
acknowledging fault. The second was obliged to go, in response to
accusations said by the government to be unsubstantiated and unfounded.
The prime minister's defence of his ministry might have been more robust if
he had commanded a three-figure majority, or if his party enjoyed more
public support. Alas, the Conservatives' overall lead in the Commons is
heading for the lower teens and sinking. In consequence, disgruntled
back-benchers exercise disproportionate power. Mr Major must balance the
demands of the right and the Eurosceptics against his comprehension of what
the electorate expects. Conservative newspapers that helped him to victory
in April 1992 have turned against him. Some, such as the Sun, occasionally
appear to be flirting with Labour; others, such as the Sunday Telegraph,
hold him in contempt.
The primary source of the most recent spate of discomfiting stories about
the Tory administration has been The Guardian. In pursuing one inquiry, Mr
Peter Preston, its editor, used a doctored parliamentary letterhead as a
subterfuge, to protect his sources. No deception was involved, he says. Mr
Preston acknowledged yesterday that 'it would have been better in retrospect
to have used another heading on the notepaper'. The Speaker of the House has
asked for a report. Labour says that The Guardian was wrong. The Tories have
gleefully pointed their fingers at its editor. Even the mortally wounded may
strike back when they see a weak spot in their opponent's defences.
Yet it would be surprising if this single incident became the trigger for a
government attempt to roll back the power of the media. Earlier this year
the Sunday Times used its own tricks of the trade to entrap a pair of
minnows, both backbench Conservative MPs, in an inquiry into the receipt of
cash for asking parliamentary questions. Its methods were upheld by the
newspaper industry's self-regulating Press Complaints Commission. Against
that, a recent poll by the Association of British Editors indicates some 80
per cent of backbenchers of all parties think the PCC is a failure, while
more than half would replace it with a statutory body.
My own view has changed. I have previously argued in favour of a privacy
law, incorporating Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights -
'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home
and his correspondence.' Canada, France, Germany, Denmark and the
Netherlands have such laws. Wronged individuals would be able to sue, as
they do now for libel. There would be a public interest defence. Acceptance
by the media of such a bill could be traded for a Freedom of Information
act.
This argument has been eroded by the co-operation of many individuals, from
royalty downwards, in the destruction of their own privacy. Never mind the
public interest defence. Politicians would use any privacy law as a shelter
behind which they could hide derelictions in their performance of their
public duties. The freedom of information act is wishful thinking. The
Conservatives refuse it, and while Labour promises one we must await the
fine print before pronouncing it worthwhile.
It would, however, be a mistake to conclude that because the government has
not so far put forward a press control bill it will never do so. Sir David
Calcutt, who offered a list of proposals in an official report four years
ago, recently questioned whether there was any political will to implement
his recommendations. He remembers the statements of past ministers, the
warning that the media was in 'last chance saloon'. It may not be there at
the moment, not while our gunslingers have the saloon surrounded, with
snipers on every roof. But one day . . .
