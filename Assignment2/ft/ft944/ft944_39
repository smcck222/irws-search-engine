FT  29 OCT 94 / Sport: Pros crack the code - Rugby
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Rugby league has overshadowed union this week, with the British Lions
beating the Kangaroos in the first of three tests.
At Wembley last Saturday, the English rugby league team, with one notable
exception, beat the Australian rugby league side 8-4.
The notable exception was the match winner, a Welshman, not any Welshman,
but former union hero Jonathan Davies.
His try just on half time came when Great Britain had been reduced from 13
to 12 men after their captain, Shaun Edwards was sent off for a tackle so
high and so dangerous that Edwards was lucky the referee did not award a
penalty try. Had he done so, the match - and almost certainly the series -
would have been lost.
Frequently in team sports, victory is not decided by the strategy of a
brilliant coach or his equally brilliant players but by the split second
action of an individual. Edwards' stupidity nearly cost his side the game.
Nearly.
Davies, at full back, and entering the line at the edge of the field, took
the ball on half way, sold an old-fashioned rugby union fly-half's dummy
and, because a league defence lacks the cover of the 15 a-side game, had
only one defender, the fullback, Brett Mullins, to take on.
Ten metres out Davies thought he would be caught and looked for support but
it had evaporated - testimony to his pace.
Davies made a split-second decision. He realised he had to find overdrive, a
gear everyone else thought he had been in for the past 40m.
'Try' went up the cry and even members of the press stood to give Davies a
standing ovation. The euphoria that swept Wembley could be smelt for minutes
afterwards.
Great Britain's win ensures full houses at Old Trafford and Leeds. But while
the game may never have been in better spirits on the field, all is not well
off it. Next year, Britain hosts the world championships. There is still no
title sponsor nor for that matter any sponsor of any description.
Rugby league does not want another competition sponsored either by
cigarettes (hooray) or alcohol. It wants to occupy the territory currently
occupied by its arch rival, union.
There is very little chance of that.
Meanwhile, in Cardiff, rugby union finally kick-started its international
season, (the Romania v Wales and Wales v Italy World Cup play-off games had
been a side show). In a dismal game, Cardiff succumbed to a very ordinary
South African side, now to be known, after some hesitation by the ANC
government, by their old name, the Springboks.
The four home unions are gunning for South Africa. This is because they
cannot face the future.
In the southern hemisphere the game has gone 'open'. Players are being paid,
in one form or another, contrary, it is true, to the spirit of the current
laws.
The game's base has moved since 1985, when the International Rugby Football
Board made its momentous decisions to hold the world cup and to hold it in
Australia and New Zealand.
In Australasia they knew the world of sport better. They had seen the
devastating effects of the Packer circus on cricket. What has happened? New
Zealand won the first world cup in 1987; Australia the second in 1991. In
1995, New Zealand, France, Australia and South Africa look the four most
likely semi-finalists.
France is the one leading northern country not eager to confront South
Africa over payments. This is because Jacques Fouroux, France's former
captain and coach, has said he is organising a professional circus, to take
place after the third world cup next year.
Fouroux has only four fixtures agreed but he does have television and
sponsorship deals in place. Hardly surprisingly, the games will be played in
South Africa. The only complication is that he has no players.
The home unions have lost the arguments. As Vernon Pugh, chairman of the
International Rugby Football Board, put it: 'The IRFB has been 10 years
behind the game. This has to change'.
As it is, the professional code is infinitely better as a spectator sport.
The game is harder and faster. It is simpler to comprehend. Every player
needs to be able to give and take a pass. The trick for each side, on the
surface a simple one, is how to break down one line of defence.
Quite the best thing that has happened to the laws is that the opposing side
must retire 10 metres rather than five after a tackle. It is this that has
added an extra dimension to the tactical part of the game.
The Australians use a huge variety of ploys. They are masters at running off
the ball. They do it at such speed and with such intelligence that I would
not hesitate to conclude, with two more tests yet to come, that these
professionals are the finest collection of athletes I have seen in this
country.
At the bi-annual IRFB meeting in Vancouver 10 days ago, the world's
governing body refused to make a decision on Pugh's report on the opening up
of the game.
'As I see it, what the Australian Rugby Union already has in situ, is what
we need to adopt throughout the world. No payment at club level; appearance
money for games played at provincial level and for our best players to be
salaried,' he said.
Going properly 'open' would of course mean that rugby union and rugby league
players could play either code at international level.
Union might try, each season, to contract every potential international
player to stop them playing the other code. But, even if this was legal and
I doubt that it would be, players would be able to move between the two
codes.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Inspired flair captures Wexford - A final act at the
festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's Wexford Opera Festival is the 13th that Elaine Padmore has
directed, and her last; she is moving on to the Royal Danish Opera.
It would be impossible to overestimate what she has done at Wexford, for
year after year she has fulfilled her brief superbly. She has chosen an
annual trio of neglected, obscure or forgotten opera with inspired flair,
resource and cunning balance. She has scoured Europe and the former Soviet
Union for the right conductors, producers and casts, from the range of
artists - especially young ones - that Wexford can afford.
The rare let down only proves that she can take brave, calculated risks.
Not least, she has kept the town thoroughly involved in it all. Good Wexford
singers find roles, one or two operas each year use a lot of local children,
and some 250 volunteers work unpaid for the festival - in the satisfying
knowledge that it is pure gain for the town. Everybody is happy, even
euphoric, as any Wexford Festival-goer can attest. At White's Hotel, the
Talbot and other watering-holes, the operas are discussed far into the
night. Miss Padmore's Italian successor will find hers a formidable act to
match.
Besides young Wagner's Das Liebesverbot, which I wrote about on Tuesday, the
1994 festival offers two more rarities: Anton Rubinstein's once-famous The
Demon (1871, premiered 1874), and the alternative La Boheme by Leoncavallo -
composed simultaneously and competitively with Puccini's, but eclipsed by
that and by his own Pagliacci, like everything else he wrote. Yet he is more
faithful to Murger's original serial, 'Scenes de la Vie de Boheme', which he
captures with a crueller vision.
Where Puccini reduced and intensified just two sentimental strands of it, to
the point where the 'bohemianism' was little more than local colour,
Leoncavallo insisted upon the feckless, nihilist real-life scene. His first
two acts give us a Schaunard - here a main character - who is a flamboyant
catch-as-catch-can composer, along with the choked poet Rodolfo, the
would-be painter Marcello and their promiscuous sweethearts Mimi and
Musette, amid their cut-rate arty parties. In the later acts they are
reduced inexorably to prostitution and destitute squalour without hope; Mimi
dies miserably while nobody does anything.
In Reto Nickler's production, the descending curve is traced without mercy.
Unfortunately, the conductor Albert Rosen gives the National Symphony
Orchestra its unbridled head at every point. His singers are driven to
ear-splitting passion, with ultimately deadening returns: Jonathan Veira's
rollicking, eye-rolling Schaunard, Patryk Wroblewski's fluffy-haired,
bespectacled, distracted Rodolfo (here a baritone), Jean-Pierre Furlan's
desperate tenor Marcello, the heartfelt - though not notably musical - Mimi
and Musette of Jungwon Park and Magali Damonte. But Leoncavallo is not,
finally, betrayed: the taste of ashes-in-the-mouth is sour and true,
over-screeched as it may be.
The Demon, in which Miss Padmore has wisely cast six fine Russian and
Ukrainian principals, proves to be more impressive than expected, even with
cuts. Perhaps it faded from the repertoire, some 70 years ago, merely
because native Russians had become hard to find in the west.
Shorn of its spooky-mystical trappings, as here in Yefim Maizel's production
and Paul Steinberg's striking modern sets, it is the story of a 'fallen
angel's' single-minded erotic obsession with young Tamara, even to her
convent re-treat.
If the music is not radically original, it manages to sound like no one
else's, and includes much that is rich and strange, quite mesmerising as
Alexander Anissimov conducts it.
Anatoly Lochak's suave, powerful baritone and Marina Mescheriakova's
dramatic soprano rise splendidly to it, with sumptuous support from Leonid
Zimnenko, Ludmilla Andrew, Alison Browner and an intense young tenor, Valery
Serkin.
A truly exciting Wexford rediscovery - and one which some larger opera
houses must surely copy in haste.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Troupe's leaden turn - The re-launched Ballet Rambert
is disappointing despite a promising group of dancers / Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1966, Ballet Rambert was re-launched as a dance company inspired by the
adventurous example of Nederlands Dans Theater. For 40 years, Rambert
nurtured talent, but fell victim to the need to lure audiences with
classical stagings of the sort we still see being touted round the regions
today.
The post-1966 Rambert troupe did grand things, helping build a public for
modern dance, joining with the London Contemporary Dance organisation in
this missionary act. But after a quarter of a century, what had been
re-named the Rambert Dance Company fell victim to declining audiences, as
did LCDT. The rigorous post-Cunningham aesthetic of Richard Alston brought
about his departure as Rambert's director, and curious funding policies
resulted in the demise of LCDT, and the forming of a smaller contemporary
troupe which is now Alston's creative home.
Meantime, Rambert was given more funds and more dancers, a strong musical
ensemble was envisaged, and Christopher Bruce, long-time a Rambert star as
dancer and choreographer, became the director. The re-launched Rambert
company was unveiled last week. And, as in 1966, the guiding influence is
that of Nederlands Dans Theater.
Bruce's choreographies have often seemed shadowed by the work of Jiri
Kylian, who has shaped Nederlands' identity. There is a similar concern with
the folksy and the non-specifically anxious, even the same affection for
dun-coloured designs and muzzy emoting. For the 'Rambert re-launch' we have
a piece from Kylian, and from Ohad Naharin, who has made pieces for NDT, and
of course from Bruce himself.
Watching Rambert in Edinburgh last week was like seeing NDT 4 - there being
already three NDT troupes, different only in that they all look the same
save in matter of the performers' age.
Be it said first of all that Bruce has assembled a magnificently promising
group of dancers. Some remain from the previous ensemble; recruits include
an outstanding artist in Ted Stoffer, fast, clear in rhythm and movement.
But the portents in Bruce's repertory choices are less encouraging. I can
see no point in baptising the troupe with Martha Clarke's Garden of Earthly
Delights.
Miss Clarke was a member of the Pilobolus company (gymnasts passing
themselves off as dancers), and this Garden was seen nearly a decade ago at
the Edinburgh Festival. It has the audacity to claim that it is 'based on'
the Bosch triptych which explores the idea of heaven and hell in astounding
and surreal imagery. What we are shown are crass mime scenes in which
dancers lurch and posture, and interfere with three hapless musicians who
provide olde-worlde tootlings and clatter. (At one moment two dancers
assault a set of tubular bells. Send not to know for whom these bells toll:
they toll for the staging.)
As a portrayal of medieval faith and its terrors, the piece is sexually and
cloacally vulgar. As a piece of dance-theatre it is brutish. As a baptismal
act it is like inviting Attila the Hun to stand as godfather. The stage is
covered with movement graffiti of the dullest and most explicit kind - every
bodily function highlighted - amid a cascade of that well-known medieval
delicacy - the raw potato. Not Bosch but tosh.
The programme ends with Bruce's Sergeant Early's Dream, dating from 1984,
which offers emotion, folk-song performed on stage (oh, that pitch-wary
keening]), and dances, blazingly done, that bring the novel news that the
peasantry had a hard time.
If this first programme might be seen as retrograde - cannot well-funded
modern dance do better and more boldly than this? - the second was worrying
in its implications. Rambert has acquired a strong musical identity with the
involvement of London Musici under Mark Stephenson.
Yet the programme brought choreographic assaults on compositions which
should not have been countenanced. Kylian's Petite Mort uses the adagios
from Mozart's K467 and K488 piano concerti as a soundtrack for a witless
exercise in sexual grappling.
The girls lurk within cut-outs of black 18th-century dresses, which are
obligingly on castors and can be rolled about the stage to give us such a
jolly laugh. Kylian, whose musical sensitivities have something of the
chain-saw about them, proposes dull duets and a good deal of spurious
'meaning' while the two adagios are played. Hell gapes.
So it does as Ohad Naharin shows 19 dancers got up as garcons de cafe (with
aprons in twee fabrics), chairs, undressing, childish humour and even more
tiresome dance ideas, and a touch of angst for his deleterious Axioma 7. The
fourth Brandenburg concerto is well played while these fatuities take place:
I hope Mr Stephenson and his musicians get danger money. The piece is of
staggering foolishness.
The programme is completed by Bruce's new Crossing, which is dark,
disturbed, reflecting the moods of Gor-ecki's grinding second string
quartet.
The programme-note makes oracular statements - each piece comes with a
guide-book quote as a kind of early-warning system - and the dance,
magnificently done (as is everything in this repertory), is richly endowed
with striving and the statutory moments of consolation. I thought it looked
most like a Rite of Spring in which no one wanted to be the Chosen Virgin.
The merits of these performances were clear to see - a superbly trained and
already coherent ensemble, and notably good musical standards. The problem
lies with the dancers' ability to transform choreographic lead into the gold
of the theatre. Match dance to dancers and Rambert will truly be
re-launched.
Rambert Dance will be at the Grand Theatre, Swansea, from November 1-5, and
at the Orchard Theatre, Dartford, from November 8-12.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Putting a fresh twist on Beethoven - A controversial
conductor who likes his players to take risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual musical partnership takes to the stage in London and Birmingham
over the next two weeks: Nikolaus Harnoncourt will conduct the Philharmonia
Orchestra in two cycles of the Beethoven symphonies. Harnoncourt is the pope
of historically-aware performing practice in continental Europe. The
Philharmonia represents the modern symphony orchestra par excellence.
Harnoncourt has been hailed as one of the most original and dynamic
interpreters of classical repertoire, celebrated for his ability to make
people hear familiar music with fresh ears. Well-known to record-buying
cognoscenti in the UK, he has been a rare visitor to London. The
Philharmonia concerts are his first encounter with a British orchestra - one
which helped shape a previous generation's knowledge of Beethoven through
its concerts and recordings with Otto Klemperer.
Just how easily the Philharmonia will absorb Harnoncourt's ideas is the
subject of much speculation in London's music establishment. Whatever
happens, the results are unlikely to be dull. Harnoncourt's Beethoven is
worlds away from the traditional approach. He favours shorter, more eventful
phrasing, rationed vibrato, sharply-defined timpani and horns that rasp like
their valveless antecedents.
He is equally far from the opposite pole of 'authentic' gurus. He has never
conducted Beethoven with a period-instrument ensemble, his dictum being that
the player is more important than the instrument. He drives Beethoven's
allegros with blinding intensity, but unlike Roger Norrington or John Eliot
Gardiner, he introduces subtle inflexions of tempo. The result is a marriage
between historical nicety and the need to project and re-invent the music
for today.
Harnoncourt, a Berlin-born Austrian, made his name as a specialist in
baroque and early music, but now spends most of his time with conventional
orchestras. Those who have worked with him speak of his instinctive feeling
for the music, backed by extensive study of contemporary sources. Francis
Hunter, who played oboe in Harnoncourt's Mozart cycle at the Zurich Opera
House, refers to 'his ability to slot into the gut level of each piece and
convey what is meaningful and expressive'.
Harnoncourt spent 17 years as a cellist in the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, so
he knows what it is like to sit listening to conductors. 'He has answers to
why he wants things done in a certain way,' says Dane Roberts, a double-bass
player in the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, with whom Harnoncourt has
recorded the Beethoven symphonies.
Harnoncourt, 64, is less forbidding in conversation than his platform manner
would suggest. He speaks good English and is accompanied everywhere by his
wife, Alice, an experienced violinist who acts as his agent.
His biggest triumphs in recent years have been at the Salzburg Festival:
cold-shouldered during the Karajan years, he has become a fixture of Gerard
Mortier's programme, and will conduct Le nozze di Figaro next summer. His
present repertoire ranges from Purcell's Fairy Queen to Bruckner's Third
Symphony. He acknowledges numerous blind spots, including Gluck, Berlioz,
Mahler and Strauss, but has late Verdi and Berg's Violin Concerto in his
sights.
Central to Harnoncourt's understanding of Beethoven is what he calls the
musical rhetoric - word-like units of phrase which grew out of the
connections between music and language in the baroque and early classical
era. 'Composers a generation after Beethoven would laugh at the idea,' he
says. 'Beethoven drew on the same musical vocabulary for 30 years of his
life - words, figures, formed from a handful of notes - and used them in a
rhetorical way. Is the musical speech a continuation of the previous phrase
or a response to it? It's important that the players know, because his music
tells you something - it's on the verge of programme music.'
Harnoncourt dismisses the idea of musical authenticity. He says that even
when orchestras play with period instruments, they are realising their idea
of sound from a 20th-century perspective. 'Musical interpretation changes
with every generation. Each laughs at its predecessor and believes it is
closer to the will of the composer. I do all the repeats in Beethoven's
symphonies, but 30 years ago it was not the done thing, and in another 30 it
will be different again. It is like changing fashion.'
One reason why the field of interpretation is so wide is that Beethoven did
not always make his final intentions clear. Harnoncourt says the autograph
scores are different to most composers of the period, 'because Beethoven did
not correct them - he gave them to a copyist and corrected the copy. The
parts were printed before the full score, so he corrected the parts. You
cannot even say the last source is the will of Beethoven, because he changed
a work like the Fourth Symphony for certain performances. You have to make a
lot of judgments yourself.'
At the same time, Harnoncourt is determined to root out modern accretions,
such as the trumpet's 'note of victory' in the first movement of the Eroica.
'Orchestras today play a note which was not written by Beethoven. You could
say the theme is not complete without it, that the trumpet players of
Beethoven's time were not good enough, so let's add it. I think Beethoven
included the failure, just as he asks the sopranos in the Missa Solemnis to
sing a note that's too high for them. He wanted their faces to be blue and
the voice to crack - this is part of the composition. A hero likes to show
only his heroic side, but what Beethoven does is to show that after all, the
hero is a failure.'
He dismisses the argument that if Beethoven had had access to today's
instruments, he would have adapted the parts accordingly. 'Then he would
have written everything differently. The limitations of the instruments were
a source of inspiration. We don't know what Beethoven would have done with
the instruments of today - geniuses always do things differently to what we
expect. I don't agree with the retouching that goes on. I don't change a
note.'
Harnoncourt also questions modern trends in orchestral sound, saying the
American-led drive for technical perfection puts the emphasis on security at
the expense of beauty. That is why he encourages brass players to experiment
with the old valveless instruments.
He describes beauty as 'something to do with unevenness - it's changing all
the time, there is a bit of dirt in it, it's not pure. If you have a group
of semi-quavers and you play them absolutely equal, it's sterile.
'For me, the most beautiful instrument lies at the edge of catastrophe. I
prefer risk - I like a musician who makes a mistake because he risks too
much.'
The Harnoncourt/Philharmonia Beethoven cycle begins at London's Royal
Festival Hall tonight and Birmingham's Symphony Hall next Thursday.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Land of natural born censors - The postponement of
Oliver Stone's controversial film, Natural Born Killers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a recent interview in the New Yorker film-maker Oliver Stone mused on the
OJ Simpson murder case. 'The line between thinking murder and doing murder
isn't that major,' he said. 'Isn't that the point of Natural Born Killers
anyway?'
Our censor certainly seems to think so. Using the excuse of caution in the
run-up to next week's Criminal Justice Bill, he has put Stone's new movie -
which was due to open in three weeks - on indefinite hold: presumably in the
belief that showing it might help those with murder in their minds to get it
out on to the streets.
A story of two young killers on the rampage, Stone's film is already a cause
celebre in its native US, where people refer to it familiarly as 'NBK' (from
the director who brought you JFK).
Several murders supposedly influenced by the film have been pinned to its
charge sheet. Original screenwriter Quentin Tarantino disowned Stone's
reworked script, saying it turned the spotlight away from the satirised
media circus on to the luridly depicted couple themselves (Woody Harrelson,
Juliette Lewis). And Mario Vargas Llosa broke jury purdah at last month's
Venice Film Festival to curse the movie publicly and to help ensure that it
won the Special Jury Prize rather than the Golden Lion. Hardly a wooden
spoon even so.
Now NBK may become the first high-profile, prize-winning feature film to be
banned outright in the UK. For a film journalist this has been a bizarre
week. Two days after rumours broke last Sunday of censor James Ferman's move
 -or rather decision not to move on the overdue certification - I rang the
distributors Warner. Their press office said NBK would open as normal, on
November 18, and that I must disregard all groundless reports.
Two days after that, the rumours had several feet of concrete under them.
And we who oppose censorship on a more or less across-the-board basis had
another 10-ton controversy coming towards us.
Natural Born Killers is not a masterpiece. In the US it was not even a
popular masterpiece. After opening strongly it fizzled out, making about
Dollars 47m (Pounds 29m). Any film-goer keen to be depraved or corrupted had
to negotiate the alienating impact of Stone's style in the film. And yet
that style - or cut-up multiplicity of styles, as if from the brain of an
intellectual who has overdosed on MTV - gives the film its one claim to
distinction.
In a matter of seconds the same scene - even the same shot - is presented in
colour/newsreel-style black-and-white/home-movie video/slow motion/fast
motion. There are surreal back-projections; there are subtitles
lantern-projected on to characters' bodies during a dialogue scene with
Indians.
Most bizarrely - and for me effectively - a flashbacked sequence of Lewis's
abused childhood is presented as broad sitcom, complete with canned laughter
and comedian Rodney Dangerfield as Dad.
This not only debunks any hint of solemn special pleading on the character's
behalf, it adds to the sense that Stone's film is less about the killers
themselves than about the multitudinous ways we re-process - and trivialise
 -true-life tragedies and horrors in the age of tabloids and wall-to-wall
TV.
The film has at least a glimmer of serious intentions. But that will not
stop the usual baying for film- makers' blood of those who see movies as
Incitement rather Insight in times of trouble and violence. For me, those in
the UK who favour screen censorship - which has a stronger hold here than in
almost any other western democracy - are in the same ideological cul-de-sac
as those who favour state subsidy to our film-makers. They think that
victory comes through lack of struggle: that moral arguments are won by
never having them, just as prosperity is won by never having to earn it.
Should children be protected from violent films? Probably they should.
(Ergo: certificates). Should the mentally unstable be shielded from violent
films? Of course they should. Should the adult, sound-minded population be
held to ransom by these sectors of society, so that none of us can see and
debate the controversial works? Of course it should not.
But the UK is a tight little island with a siege mentality towards its
culture and morals. We are natural born censors. This goes all the way from
the protectionist nationalism of our attitude to our film industry  - we
believe the world owes us a living - to the throttling of free and informed
debate on movies like Natural Born Killers, by withholding the movie itself.
We have had no full explanation from the censor on why he has singled out
Stone's film. He himself has poured scepticism on the 'copycat' factor by
referring to last year's Child's Play 3 false furore. The pointless
martyrdom visited on Natural Born Killers, if delayed certification turns
into a ban, may end up enhancing not diminishing the film's reputation.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Searching for space in outpost by the sea - The Tate
at St Ives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tate Gallery at St Ives, a new and not exactly unobtrusive building by
Evans and Shalev on the site of the old gasworks overlooking Porthmeor
Beach, was opened to the public last summer amid much local bally-hoo. Why
should Modern Art be imposed so heavily, and so expensively, on an old
fishing town that was used to artists but these days depended upon tourism
for its livelihood? Would such money not be better spent on a leisure
centre, or a swimming pool?
Protests were made, meetings held: and now we have something of an answer.
The scheme was argued on a projected annual attendance of some 70,000
visitors. This target was reached within months. The full year achieved a
total well over 200,000. More to the point, with tourism so seasonal and St
Ives shutting up shop for the winter, attendance ran to above 80,000 through
the winter months. The seasonal orthodoxy has been confounded.
That said, however, the Tate itself does face certain problems.
Purpose-built as it is, the building was never designed to cope with so many
people. And once inside, the galleries seem surprisingly few, and rather
small. The view over the beach may be spectacular, the cafe delightful, the
bookshop full, the lobbies even generous in proportion to the rest. But has
not space been wasted, just a bit?
In fairness it must be said that such questions are being addressed as
exhibiting policy evolves beyond the first plans. This time more works have
actually been hung. And while the concentration on the later modern artists
of St Ives itself - on from Ben Nicholson, Christopher Wood and old Alfred
Wallis in the late 1920s - is clearly not to be given up, it is never to be
dogmatically exclusive. That, with Newlyn and its turn-of-the-century
painters only six miles away, would be merely perverse.
But there is another nettle to be grasped. The Tate was never going to offer
any permanent display of the St Ives artists in Cornwall, for to do so was
not possible in the restricted space, nor desirable in what must always be
an outpost. What is given instead is a rolling programme of displays, each
treating on a given aspect of the subject. Yet what is the distinction
between the impermanent study display and the temporary exhibition?
For these new displays, chronology is given up and the five galleries
devoted each to a separate theme: The Penwith Landscape; In the Studio;
Private and Mythic Narrative; Observation and Abstraction. The fifth, and
the only one called a study display, is in fact a small exhibition of Peter
Lanyon's two 'Generation' series, made in the late 1940s after his return
from the war. Both are figurative, one more mystical with its chalices and
still life, the second directly founded in the coastal landscape of West
Penwith and Portreath. Together they foreshadow the larger and ab-stracted
expressions of the sensation of landscape that characterised Lanyon's later
work.
Apart from what it tells us of Lanyon, this little show makes the point that
so focused an exercise carries a disproportionate weight. The Tate at St
Ives is perfect for the coherent temporary exhibition of medium size, which
is not the same as the current run of displays through the remaining
galleries. With them the sense is rather of the hanging of sympathetic work
first, and the naming of it later. It is not a question of size, but only of
purpose and concentration.
Even so, each room holds remarkable and beautiful things - Paul Feiler's
abstract rockscapes and the Alfred Wallises in the first room, Margaret
Mellis's anemone in the second, Frost and Heron and Scott in the fifth. And
the grievously under-rated Karl Weschke's dark, drowned body on the beach,
in the fourth room, would grace 'The Romantic Spirit in German Art' now at
the Hayward, had the organisers but the wit to know of it.
Downstairs, in the entrance lobby, is a monumentally lumpen sculpture by
Peter Randall-Page. He is the most distinguished stone-carver of his
generation and quite at home in the town and spiritual company of Barbara
Hepworth. The London show of his latest carvings, 'Secret Life', massive
pods of granite split to reveal their carved insides and looking magnificent
against the Thames at Reed's Wharf, has a week to run.
The New Displays: Tate Gallery St Ives, Cornwall: sponsored by Intercity.
Peter Randall-Page - Secret Life: Reed's Wharf Gallery, Mill Street SE1,
until November 5.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Feminist mauling of the power of myth - A
deconstruction of fairy-tales

   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
FROM THE BEAST TO THE BLONDE by Marina Warner Chatto and Windus Pounds 20,
480 pages
Of all art forms, the fairy-tale is the most reliable barometer of a
society's cultural priorities. It is the oldest popular literature we know,
and responses to it have always spoken loudly for their times.
In the 18th century - the Age of Reason - fairy-tales were banned from the
nursery as dangerously imaginative. With the Victorians, their innocent
heroines were sentimentalised - Dickens said perfect bliss would be to marry
Little Red Riding Hood. In the 1930s, the Nazis billed the Grimm Brothers'
stories as pure Aryan volk tales, advertisements for the German heritage.
Marina Warner, one of the best-known cultural commentators of the 1990s, has
brought the politically correct cliches and intellectual fripperies of
contemporary mediaspeak to bear on fairy-tales.
The book confirms what the Reith lectures earlier this year suggested: that
Warner is not a serious thinker in search of the truth but a propagandist
for a brand of popular, feminist prejudice. She uses the trappings of
scholarly reference and literary allusion to deliver familiar ideas which
neither challenge nor illuminate the received wisdoms of our age.
From the Beast to the Blonde says that fairy-tales offer a misogynist view
of female characters. This misogyny can be traced to the 'particular web of
tensions in which women were enmeshed' when the stories were first recorded,
but it is now outdated and we should develop alternative readings.
Warner shows convincingly how features of fairy-tales that we take for
granted are rooted in specific historical periods. Mothers are absent
because they often died in childbirth: Cinderella, in sackcloth and ashes,
is a child mourning her mother. Stepmothers are present because widowers
generally remarried: 80 per cent did so within a year in 17th- and
18th-century France, when the early literary versions of Cinderella and
other tales were written by courtly authors like Charles Perrault. Arranged
marriages, dynastic feuds, dowries - all were part of the daily fabric from
which the tales emerged, and explain why evil stepmothers and cruel
stepsisters play vital roles.
Warner presents her case as a quarrel with a second - and by no means a
contradictory - interpretation of these characters: as archetypes who tell
us less about history than about the human psyche.
Bruno Bettelheim, in his seminal book The Uses of Enchantment (1976),
crystallised this psycho-analytical view, showing brilliantly how the tales
confront unconscious dilemmas and help resolve them through fantasy -
sibling rivalry in Cinderella, mother/daughter friction in Sleeping Beauty,
fear of abandonment in Hansel and Gretel. Bettelheim spoke up for the evil
stepmother, arguing that she licensed children's fantasies of hatred by
preserving the idea of the good real mother, and that when she is offset by
a fairy godmother, as in Cinderella, a child can work through his sense of a
parent as both benign and threatening.
For Warner, 'this archetypal approach leeches history out of fairy-tale . .
. Bettelheim's theory has contributed to the continuing absence of good
mothers from fairy-tales in all kinds of media, and to a dangerous degree
which itself mirrors current prejudices and reinforces them'. Evil
stepmothers, ogresses, ugly sisters have become 'hallowed, inevitable
symbols, while figures like the Beast bridegroom have been granted ever more
positive status . . . the danger of women has become more and more part of
the story, and correspondingly, the danger of men has receded'.
To want fairy-tales without stepmothers and ogresses is to want Hamlet
without the prince. Characters from great literature are both archetypal and
historically specific, to deny one or the other is to make a nonsense of how
art develops out of the particular to show the universal. Jane Austen's
characters, for example, are unimaginable outside their calm 18th-century
houses, yet they survive in our imagination because they go so far beyond
them in their timeless human experiences.
There are other flaws in Warner's attempt to talk away the power of myth.
Her evidence for misogyny is ridiculously weighted. The handful of bad women
she fixes on can easily be matched by a cast of male horrors - Bluebeard,
Rumpelstiltskin, ogres and giants, the child murderer in Babes in the Wood.
More seriously, her argument that outmoded stereotypes still shape the tales
conflicts crucially with the central piece of criticism in the book, the
deconstruction of Beauty and the Beast. Warner examines how recent versions
 -Angela Carter's retellings, the Disney film - reflect two shifts in modern
sensibility.
One is the revolution in attitudes to animals, now romanticised rather than
feared as in medieval Europe, when bears roamed the woods on the outskirts
of town. In the film, the cuddly Beast resembles the American buffalo and
'represents the lost innocence of the plains before man came to plunder'.
The second is sexual liberation. Where once the Beast had to be tamed, now
he answers Beauty's desire for wild sexuality.
The Disney film was made not only for Me-generation kids - the first song is
'I want much more than they've got planned' - but for mums raised on Gloria
Steinem and the ecology movement. It indicates the extent to which feminist
thought now governs popular culture, and it reduces to absurdity Warner's
conspiracy theory that 'as individual women's voices have become absorbed
into the corporate body of male-dominated decision-makers', fairy-tales have
become the province of misogynist tellers.
From the Beast to the Blonde joins the fray of one of the great intellectual
battles this century: feminism versus psycho-analysis. But, unlike Warner's
previous subject - the Virgin Mary, Joan of Arc - Goldi-locks and Jack and
the Beanstalk do not fit easily into the grooves of sexual politics. As a
result, the book carries a tone of carping insecurity and complaint which
sits oddly with both the subject of fairy-tales and with Warner's
intelligence and scholarly ability.
Both Bettelheim and Iona and Peter Opie, the other great modern writers on
the tales, echo in their criticism the upbeat optimistic mood of fairy-tales
themselves. The Uses of Enchantment ends with an account of family
happiness: 'This is one of the manifold truths revealed by fairy-tales,
which can guide our lives; it is a truth as valid today as it was once upon
a time.'
By contrast, Warner concludes on a note as weak as Bettelheim's is strong:
'It is time for wishful thinking to have its due.' It is the difference
between a critic who was wise enough to stand outside his times and write
what he believed in, and one who is pandering to popular prejudices.

YOUNGHUSBAND: THE LAST GREAT IMPERIAL ADVENTURER by Patrick French
HarperCollins Pounds 20, 440 pages
Francis Younghusband was one of the great eccentrics of the later British
Empire, a large club which included Gordon, Baden-Powell, Meinertzhagen, and
many more. Patrick French has given him an enthralling, well-written,
revelatory and flawed biography.
I am not sure about the sub-title - was Younghusband really the 'last great
imperial adventurer'? (What about the Arabian gang, including TE Lawrence?)
But he was certainly a great and maverick character whose invasion of Tibet
in 1904 was only one episode in a dramatic life. 'Journalist, spy, guru,
geographer, writer, staunch imperialist, Indian nationalist, philosopher and
explorer' are listed by French (leaving out soldier and geriatric lover),
and he adds: 'How had a blimpish colonialist managed to end up as a
premature hippy?'
Younghusband's exploits in Asia have of course been recorded before, most
recently by Peter Hopkirk and Anthony Verrier, and before that by Peter
Fleming and Jan Morris. The value of Mr French's book is that he tells us so
much about the rest of the life: indeed, he has the wit to argue that the
Tibetan adventure was merely 'a formative part of an extraordinary journey
of personal discovery and development'.
After 1908, when Younghusband retreated from India to Britain, he recedes
from our history books; yet he became author, public figure, president of
the Royal Geographical Society, founder of the 'Fight for Right' patriotic
movement in 1915, commissioner of the Jerusalem anthem, promoter of the
first Everest expeditions, forerunner of the 'Gaia' theories which are today
favoured by Professor James Lovelock and the New Age movement, stalwart of
the Travellers Club, mystic ('a religion of atheism' said his friend
Bertrand Russell), supporter of Indian independence, philosopher, crank -
and (Mr French's most delicious discovery) the passionate 76-year-old lover
of Madeline, Lady Lees, with whom he published a marriage manual and to whom
he wrote, 'The woman in you makes great appeal to me and rouses all the most
manly in me. You are a remarkable illustration of the essential Creative
Spirit of the World . . .'; he thought Lady Lees might be the Messiah (he
had had a cold and unhappy marriage).
Well might the biographer ask, after 300 pages, 'Was he barking mad?' To
which the answer must be, not quite. Younghusband was a product of
post-Mutiny Anglo-India and Clifton (where he acquired a lifelong friend in
Sir Henry Newbolt and a habit of cold baths, which he continued to indulge
at 20 degrees below in the Karakoram). The young Army officer with an
Evangelical background and an interest in Buddhism began to have mystical
experiences in the high mountains, and his colleagues must have been aware
that a certain instability might accompany the compulsive risk-taking and
extreme physical stamina - as the colonial phrase would put it, he tended to
'go bush'.
He made an early name for himself on a crossing of the Gobi Desert and then
as a young participant in the Great Game, in the remote region where Russia,
China and British India met. It was Younghusband who, when sent to tame the
Mir of Hunza in 1889 - 'I knew that he was a cur at heart, and I have no
doubt he was impressed by my bearing' - encountered the Tsar's forward agent
Grombtchevski; he deliberately mis-directed the Russian, almost to his
death, an episode which surely must have inspired the scene in Kim, though
Mr French does not mention it.
The subsequent career was by no means smooth. Younghusband only got the
Tibet expedition in 1903-4 because he was a chum of Lord Curzon. Mr French
enjoys telling the story of this last round of the Great Game, without
forgetting that the invasion was an unnecessary failure - the Viceroy and
Younghusband sincerely believed that the Russians were in bed with the
Tibetans, and were wrong. The advance on Lhasa was never intended by
Balfour's government, and Younghusband, not so unfairly, was to be a
scapegoat.
That should not have surprised anyone: Younghusband was usually out of his
depth in the world of diplomacy, whether in the Himalayas or in his
mysterious, and still obscure, involvement in the Jameson Raid in 1895
Transvaal. Ninety years on, with the Chinese more than ever the imperial
masters of Tibet, that useless British exercise looks even shoddier, less
justifiable than ever.
There is one serious flaw in this enjoyable read (apart from the inadequate
maps, whereas the photographs are good). Mr French has chosen to tell this
splendid tale in the framework of his own recent travels in the region 'to
follow his trail'. There is surely something - well, immodest about this in
the context of such superhuman exploration. Who cares about the young Mr
French's stopover impressions of Kabul Airport? Who cares that he failed to
follow the route of the 1903 invasion, failed to find the letters to the
adored Mrs Douglas, fell ill in Calcutta, and overdramatises his own minor
skirmish with the Indian Army in Sikkim?
But to set against this we have a frequently happy turn of phrase - for
example, of the west's fascination with the east, 'conquest and wonder
dancing hand-in-hand' - and an eye for the apt quotation, as when
Younghusband writes to a married lady he fancies, 'You would make a splendid
Colonel of a Cavalry Regiment if you were a man . . .'
Those were the days.

paradoxes

IAIN MACLEOD. A BIOGRAPHY by Robert Shepherd Hutchinson Pounds 25, 608 pages
Iain Macleod has been a legendary figure in the Tory Party for so long that
it is surprising we have had to wait until now for a comprehensive
biography.
Even posthumously, paradoxes abound. Macleod was one of the first senior
Tory MPs to recognise the talents of the young Margaret Thatcher. As shadow
chancellor in the mid-1960s, he insisted that she should be his
second-in-command, and let her rip. He concluded quickly that one day there
could be a woman prime minister, and it might be her.
At the same time, as we now know, Macleod was the hero of another aspiring
politician who was also a future prime minister: John Major. It was
Macleod's appeal to one nation and his ability to captivate a Tory Party
conference that Major admired.
Yet Macleod made enemies as well as friends. Lord Salisbury, once a force to
be reckoned with in the party, dismissed him as 'too clever by half', and
the charge stuck. Alec Douglas Home, in whose cabinet Macleod declined to
serve, thought that Macleod was naive, especially over Africa. Macleod
thought that Home was the most arrogant man he ever met.
In one telling case, friendship turned to ashes. Two of the guiding lights
in the post-1945 Conservative Party were Macleod and Enoch Powell. Macleod
long regarded Powell as an intellectual mentor, even if he seldom went all
the way with his conclusions. When Powell turned against coloured
immigration, the friendship died.
Some of Macleod's other likes and dislikes have no obvious explanation. He
rather liked James Callaghan: the pair of them shadowed each other across
the House of Commons first on colonial policy, then on the economy. He had a
marked distaste for Roy Jenkins, despite the fact that the kind of Britain
that both of them wanted to see must have been practically identical. He
professed to despise Harold Wilson, although Wilson was one of his greatest
admirers.
Above all, Macleod thought that Edward Heath was boring and never considered
him as a serious contender for the leadership of the party until it was too
late to stop him.
In short, Macleod was a very unusual man, which is what this book is about -
or should be. At times Robert Shepherd's biography is a little too
comprehensive, a mite too taken up with detail, to let the story of the man
come through. Yet the story is still there.
Macleod was a gambler. Early in the war, after a bout of drinking, he
attempted to shoot his commanding officer for refusing to play stud poker
with him. But that was an aberration. On the whole he gambled astutely. He
made his spending money out of playing bridge and writing about it in the
newspapers. He helped to invent the Acol system of bidding - named after a
club in Acol Road, South Hampstead.
Shepherd perhaps understates the importance of this. The system works by
keeping the initial bidding low in order to allow for a possible dramatic
change of suit later on. That was how Macleod worked in everything.
As minister of labour in the late 1950s, he loved bargaining with the unions
over pay. Some of the union leaders respected him for it. At one stage,
during a famous London bus strike, a group of them went to see him privately
to say that Frank Cousins, the transport and general workers' leader, should
be taken down a peg.
Macleod continued in much the same style as colonial secretary. In
retrospect, that was far and away his most important job. When he appointed
him after the 1959 general election, Harold Macmillan noted that 'Africa
seems to be the biggest problem looming for us here at home'. Macleod's task
was to accelerate independence without provoking massive unrest. He did it
through a series of cliff-hanging negotiations during which both blacks and
whites often claimed that they had no idea which way he would play the
cards.
The unrest that resulted was mainly in the Tory Party at home, which was why
Macmillan removed him from the job after two years. Nothing that Macleod did
subsequently quite lived up to the African achievement. For a while he
seemed a possible future leader, but was pre-empted by Home and then
overtaken by Heath. He might have been a very good, tax-reforming chancellor
of the exchequer when the Tories returned to office in 1970, but he died
within a month.
There were other sides to Macleod's character apart from the gambler. He was
brought up in Yorkshire, but had roots in the Scottish isles. His father was
a GP from whom Macleod inherited a social conscience. His first mark in
politics was to speak up for the reform, but also the preservation, of the
health service. His belief in the brotherhood of man lay behind his approach
to African independence. Previous colonial secretaries had been well off:
Macleod had to cash in his life insurance policy to defray his expenses.
He loved poetry and could quote it at length; also sport. From early on, his
physical health was not good and grew steadily worse. He concealed his pain
very well. He was a great speaker with a marvellous voice and immaculate
sense of timing. He was also a sparkling journalist, as his stint as editor
of The Spectator revealed after he refused to serve under Home.
Yet he was undoubtedly ambitious for the premiership and, as Shepherd points
out, could be devious and calculating. Shepherd perhaps attributes too many
of the unsigned articles in The Spectator to Macleod himself. I know because
I was there. When he wrote his most famous article of all on the Tory magic
circle, I suggested that we should put on the cover simply 'What Happened'
by Iain Macleod. 'That'll do,' he said. Then he chuckled and added quietly:
'Well, some of what happened.'

SEX IN GEORGIAN ENGLAND by AD Harvey Duckworth Pounds 20, 205 pages
THE MAKING OF VICTORIAN SEXUAL ATTITUDES by Michael Mason Oxford Pounds
17.99, 256 pages
More is talked and written about sex now than at any time in our history.
Until recently we took this as a sign that ours is a time of sexual
liberation. Because of the erratic genius and even more erratic scholarship
of Michel Foucault, however, we have been made to see that this is not so.
We are, according to him, still in the grip of repressions and inhibitions
which have grown apace since the 17th century.
Few historians accept Foucault's consciously wayward treatment of the facts,
but on this point at least he seems right. Neither AD Harvey nor Michael
Mason make use of his views in reporting the complex recent history of
attitudes to sex, but it is hard not to conclude, after reading their books,
that despite Freud and improved contraceptive technology, we are - as
Foucault claimed - scarcely more rational, liberal, or active now than our
forebears were in 1700.
Note the phrase 'attitudes to sex': these books are not about sexual
practices but about ideas and opinions. Harvey traces the change in
attitudes to sex during the 18th century, Mason the nature of attitudes to
sex in the 19th century. There is considerable overlap between them, not
just in subject matter but also in time. Together, although unintentionally,
they provide a continuous history of changes in attitudes to sex in the two
centuries before Freud.
In early Georgian England it was commonplace to believe that women had
stronger sexual appetites than men. 'A woman is 10 times more inclined to,
and delighted in copulation than a man,' wrote one supposed authority; 'in
the rites of love,' wrote another, 'a woman is too many for a man, and
capable of tiring him quite down'. The robust picture of female sexuality
implicit in Shakespearean bawdy is recognisable here. But by the beginning
of the 19th century, women had become frail and delicate, and 'expert'
opinion now proclaimed that the normal female sexual appetite was 'dormant,
if not non-existent'.
In Harvey's view, what was going on was a denial of female sexuality coupled
with an increasing concern for female 'purity'. With the view of women as
inferior and vulnerable there grew up new mythologies of seduction and rape
 -the former being what happened when girls said 'yes', the latter when they
said 'no'.
The common belief was that girls who had 'mislaid their virginity' were
doomed to the streets.
Harvey reports Georgian England's increasingly anxious attitudes towards
sex, and its concomitant attempts at repression and control. Mason, who
recently published a much-praised account of Victorian sexual life, focuses
attention on the surprising fact that it was secular, rather than religious,
opinion which turned Georgian anxiety into Victorian obsession.
The usual view is that Methodism and evangelical Anglicanism were
responsible for the primness of Victorian sexual attitudes. Mason shows that
religious orthodoxy in England was on the whole in favour of sexuality -
within marriage, of course - and strongly disapproved of the celibacy of
Roman Catholic priests and nuns. 'Anti-sensualism' came not from vicars and
bishops but from progressive opinion, such as the followers of Bentham, the
proponents of working-class self-improvement, and the feminists, most of
whom were opposed to liberalised sexual attitudes and birth control.
This odd inversion is explained, according to Mason, by the progressive
belief that the more human beings aspire to civilised values, the less
instinctual and animal they become - and this means, the less they are
gripped by sexual appetite. Mason calls this 'aspirational anti-sensualism'.
The claim that such views, rather than canting religious sentiment, are the
chief engine of Victorian morality is a striking and original thesis. Mason
does not deny that religious sentiment played its part, but he accords it a
'passive' role.
There is one important gap in Mason's account. The growing confidence of
Victorian medical science put a weapon into male Establishment hands which
obstructed a clear-eyed understanding of sexuality in general and female
sexuality in particular. Much of what was believed about sex by Victorian
doctors has since been stood on its head, but surprisingly many of its
prejudices remain. Only now, for example, is it again being acknowledged
that women have as robust a sexual appetite as men.
These are instructive and important books. Apart from their special
interest, they show yet again that the study of history is an absolute
necessity for understanding most things human.

EVELYN WAUGH: A BIOGRAPHY by Selina Hastings. Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20,
724 pages
This is the third biography of Evelyn Waugh. The general picture of a
monster who was a comic genius and who wrote like an angel remains; but this
portrait is painted in warm fresh colours; the background is filled in with
an eye for detail based on much new investigation and from personal
knowledge.
Waugh emerges as an even more complex character than before as he travels
through a life that began in 1903 at Fortune Green, North London, as the
second son of Arthur Waugh, publisher and occasional writer.
Waugh does not become any nicer through renewed acquaintance. At Lancing
College he moved in a precocious set that included Tom Driberg, Dudley Crew
(later Times film critic), Roger Fulford and Max Mallowan. The latter
remembered Waugh as: 'courageous and witty and clever but (he) was also an
exhibitionist with a cruel nature that cared nothing about humiliating his
companions as long as he could expose them to riducule.'
Those traits remained for the rest of his life. At Oxford, he fell foul of
his history tutor, CRMF Cruttwell, who became thereafter a constant butt of
Waugh the writer's wit. Waugh went down without a degree but not without
memorable experience. He had fallen in love with inebriate, feckless
Alistair Graham, a Catholic convert (who became Sebastian Flyte in
Brideshead), and had met two homosexual aesthetes Harold Acton and Brian
Howard (who jointly became Anthony Blanche).
Waugh had no job and no prospects. Art seemed an option. He had a talent for
drawing - or perhaps cabinet-making. He revered craftsmen. In the end it had
to be schoolmastering. He went off to Arnold House, Llanddulas,
Denbighshire, where he became popular among the boys on account, we are
told, of 'his enlightened policy of laisser faire'. He hated it but it was
all wonderful copy. When Decline and Fall came out, illustrated by him in
1928, he enjoyed universal critical success. 'An uncompromising and
brilliantly malicious satire,' said Arnold Bennett in the Evening Standard.
Waugh was still only 24.
His first brief marriage soon came to grief and Waugh, now a celebrity, fell
in love with many of the well-bred young women he met. Most were indifferent
to him as a lover. Sometimes it was whole families of whom he became
enamoured in his upward ascent. There were most importantly the Plunkett
Greenes, two tall brothers, a daughter and a mother Gwen, niece of Baron von
Hugel, the theologian.
It was she - Gwen Greene - who set Waugh on the path to Rome and Father
Martin D'Arcy who instructed him. It took a long time for the Vatican to
annul his youthful marriage, a measure that became urgent when Waugh met his
fate, Laura Herbert, 18, who was of all things the cousin of 'She-Evelyn',
his first wife. 'I thought we had heard the last of that young man,' said
her aunt.
A happy permanent second marriage did not somehow mellow Waugh. Children, of
which they had several, bored him. He tended to disappear when his wife's
pregancies came to term. Instances of his incivility, his outrageous
behaviour in his public life, abound. Feuds with other writers such as Peter
Quennell could be never ending.
His saving grace was courage. He was an intrepid traveller before the war on
various assignments including visits to Abyssinia (see Black Mischief and
Scoop). As an officer in the Royal Marines and Commandos Waugh behaved badly
in the mess and inconsiderately towards his men, but was brave in action
especially during the exodus from Crete.
The contradictions inherent in Evelyn Waugh could be endlessly prolonged.
The role of the landed English Catholic country gentleman, in which he cast
himself, was stressful for him to keep up. Add to it the precariousness of
literature as a means of sustaining a large household and an extravagant
lifestyle and you have the prelude to the ship-board crack-up so well
described in Pinfold. It was precipitated by bromide poisoning; he was
taking it to cure his insomnia.
In his last years Waugh became an icon of English insularity, a volcanic
John Bull-figure in houndstooth suit, brandishing cigar or ear-trumpet which
he put to his ear when he was speaking and lowered when you were. In fact,
you were most unlikely to get anywhere near him especially if you were a
journalist. He saw the intrusive Nancy Spain of the Daily Express literally
off his premises and then successfully pursued her through the courts for
libel. He managed in the famous television Face to Face interview to
discomfit the normally unflappable John Freeman by replying to his probing
questions in brusque monosyllablic one-liners.
After more than quarter of a century, neither the legend nor the bad
behaviour matters. Great comic novelists such as Waugh and Dickens do often
behave badly to their nearest and dearest as well as to their furthest and
most loathed. Waugh the man diminishes to nothing when placed beside the
delights of his still hugely readable fiction.
Selina Hastings does not neglect this. She can be most perceptive when
relating the life to the novels. All are still in print and selling well.
Vile Bodies and Brideshead Revisited both sold between 11,000 and 12,000
copies last year. If Waugh were alive he would, surely, at 91, be gruntled
to know that.

CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE by Douglas Rushkoff Flamingo
Pounds 6.99, 320pp
The Utopian urge has been with us since Cro-Magnon man started bumping his
head on the cave ceiling, so it is hardly surprising that some people
maintain that quantum advances in information technology might give birth to
a vastly better society.
The young American journalist Douglas Rushkoff is such a believer. His
lively and informed book is an ode to computers and fibre optics, a glowing
map of a brave new world called Cyberspace.
Rushkoff defines Cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination accessed through
the computer' - hence, anything from two people speaking by satellite link,
to a boy wandering deep in the latest virtual reality program.
For Rushkoff, Cyberspace is a realm ripe with possibilities for new human
organisation and development. It is a place potentially free of governmental
oversight and personal neuroses, where human impulses can be infinitely
perfected with the help of the microchip.
The author is at his most convincing while charting recent advances in
hardware technology and showing how these have benefited the human
imagination. For Rushkoff, the existence of a 'datasphere', where a large
number of people are plugged into one another's computers, provides an
imaginative arena of unbridled possibility.
He posits a world where business meetings and classrooms no longer require
physical proximity, where correspondence occurs without delay, where news
can be transmitted without need for media conglomerates. Rushkoff
breathlessly scans the future horizon, catching glimpses of scenarios such
as cyber-sex between two people using Virtual Reality software and 'wet',
body-reactive hard-
ware.
It is hard to argue that technology like Video Toasters, which allow us to
'sample' television shows as disc jockeys now do records, and 'wireheading',
hardware that plugs directly into the human brain, promise a whole new way
to work and play.
What Rushkoff seems to have less of a stomach for is the dark side of this
world, the dystopia in which technology is used as a means of repression and
conformity rather than liberation. Believing that 'as computer-networking
technology gets into the hands of more cyberians, historical power centers
are challenged,' he seems to forget that the reason so much power is
centralised is that the people who wield it have a knack of staying one step
ahead of the rest of us. Cyberia's relation to its Soviet namesake may be
more meaningful than just a facile pun. That said, Rushkoff's examination of
the technological aspects of Cyberspace remains essential for those
interested in the subject.
Where the book proves far less effective is in its second part, which deals
with the non-computing side of Cyberia. Smart drugs, house music and
Cyberpunk fiction are all subsumed under a tatty umbrella of New Age
thinking that would have us believe is in some way related to the
information revolution.
Rushkoff's arguments are far from convincing - one need only listen to the
monotonous drone of rave music or the cretinous babble of a 'smart drug'
saleswoman to understand that this is nothing more than warmed-over
hippyism. Rushkoff's prose, so lucid in the early parts of the book, becomes
unmoored and jargon-ridden as he takes us through the poorly-lit labyrinth
of 'neopaganism' and 'technoshamanism'. Where he started off largely
convincing us that a brave new world was being born, we leave the book
thinking that Cyberia is little more than an enclave for the sort of
drop-outs who have always found their utopia in the same place - anywhere
but here.

ALEC GUINNESS, MASTER OF DISGUISE by Garry O'Connor Hodder Pounds 17.99, 316
pages
Alec Guinness is a maddening challenge for a biographer: private life
impeccable and without incident; career one of absolutely solid achievement,
the one or two failures subsumed in a steady march to glory; work
exceptionally fine and universally admired.
The renowned mystery and secrecy of the man prove simply to be a refusal of
the usual pact by which successful actors, in exchange for perpetual
publicity, allow themselves to be reinvented by the media. In fact,
Guinness, as countless people - as opposed to journalists? - have testified,
is a delightful and amusing companion, deeply interested in the outside
world while being inordinately fond of his home, lover of food and wine,
relisher of literature and art and prone to intense enthusiasm for both
things and people. A paragon, in fact. What's the catch, the biographer
wants to know. What, he asks impatiently, makes the guy tick? 'I was not
aware,' Guinness replied magisterially to an interviewer who asked the same
question, 'that I was ticking.' He is, of course; very loudly indeed. There
is a great deal going on inside, emotionally and intellectually. What
exactly this might be is the question which Garry O'Connor addresses.
Mr O'Connor has a distinguished record as a biographer; his account of Ralph
Richardson is nothing short of a masterpiece, the life itself interleaved
with his extraordinary encounters with his subject.
In the case of Guinness, for better or for worse, he has not had the same
advantages. He has accordingly made as much as he can of the existing
record, above all, of course, Guinness's own masterly Blessings in Disguise
(another curse to the biographer: the carpet pulled from underneath his
feet).
The revelation that Guinness chose to make in that book of his illegitimacy
and terrifying upbringing is the core of Mr O'Connor's meditation on his
life and art. The quest for the father; the distrust of the mother. Mr
O'Connor detects these everywhere and it is no surprise that he sees Hamlet
as the correlative of Guinness's inner journey. There is obvious truth in
this; but it cannot explain Guinness either as man or as actor.
The essential fact about Guinness is that he transmuted his inner drama into
acting, not in an autobiographical sense but by becoming a sort of
ontological magician. He was able to release himself into character, or
rather, perhaps, he was able to allow himself to be seduced by, to be taken
over by, another self; and he did this above all by the power of thought.
It was no emotional abandonment, rather a consciously acquired ability to
discharge the rage and feelings of impotence that Blessing in Disguise
clearly tells us were the primary experiences of his young life. The need to
control and release these emotions produced the powerful mental instrument
that is central to Guinness's work.
There is a mystery here and it turns out to be the mystery of acting itself.
Mr O'Connor is not good at analysing this because he is less interested in
the physical performance than in what the performance portends. The alchemy
is merely alluded to.
As for what goes on in Guinness's mind, O'Connor seems to view him as an
intellectual; this, I submit, is not the case. He is a man of prodigious,
almost frightening, mental force, but ideas, the medium of the intellectual,
are not what he uses his mind on. He observes, he penetrates, sometimes he
eviscerates.
He is a remarkable writer. I would suggest that he is that rare actor, one
who has the temperament of a writer - and not necessarily a dramatist. His
performances could almost be said to have the depth and complexity of
fiction.
Perhaps this might explain a certain lack of linearity in his stage career,
a quest for characters rather than roles. His has been a unique journey; Mr
O'Connor charts it thoroughly and intelligently, in a series of short
chapters and in elegant prose which cannot, however, conceal the fact that
he raises questions which he is unable to answer. So the Master of Disguise
of the title has eluded the detective yet again.

THE OXFORD COMPANION TO WINE edited by Jancis Robinson Oxford University
Press Pounds 30, 1086 pages
In editing this massive Oxford Companion to Wine, Jancis Robinson, Financial
Times wine writer, has accomplished a unique double. She was the first
person to present a television wine series. Now she is the first person to
offer to a smaller but more knowledgeable public an impressive reference
volume that treats wine as English literature, music, art, mind and medicine
have already been treated. She calls the writing of it 'the greatest
challenge of my life'.
There are more than 3,000 alphabetically-arranged entries, many of them
illustrated, which cover an immense range of subjects, some of which could
include cross references to other OUP Companions. There is an interesting
entry, for example, on wine in English literature though none, surprisingly,
on art or music. There is, too, one on 'Health, Effects of Wine Consumption'
with a reference in the reading list to Sir Richard Doll. There are many
references to mind. Under Herodotus, for example, we learn that 'far from
regarding drunkenness as undesirable or immoderate behaviour, the Persians,
if Herodotus is to be trusted, viewed it as an altered state of
consciousness that is as valuable as sobriety'. The very presence of
Herodotus in the volume demonstrates that the ancient world is given due
attention.
History, indeed, is well treated throughout. The 19th century is not
neglected, and some of the interesting British writers on wine are included,
like AIexander Henderson (a medical doctor) and Cyrus Redding, 'England's
answer to the great wine explorer of France, Andre Jullien'. Both Redding
and Jullien were travellers, and Redding, convinced that geography mattered
more than history, discussed wines from all parts of the world. Geography
and history have always travelled well together in studies of wine, both
academic and popular, and more than one-third of this volume is devoted to
specific wines and wine regions: there are 31 regional maps.
Some of them reveal the topical strains to which wine making is subject. The
article called Yugoslavia incorporates a map called 'former Yugoslavia'. The
article on Cyprus is as problem-laden as Cyprus itself. Azerbaijan and
America have articles too. Apparently vineyards in Azerbaijan account for 7
per cent of cultivated land and grapes for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of
agricultural output.
There are 12 articles on the former Soviet Republics (as revealing as the
excellent articles on Argentina and Chile) and one on 'Soviet sparkling
wines', a specific term devised according to European Union law ('See
European Union'). Gorbachev, who tried to cut alcohol consumption (there is
no article on him or on Yeltsin) does not appear as a liberator in this
context. He makes a dramatic entrance, for example, into the article on
Bulgaria: 'Gorbachev's arrival as Soviet premier had dire consequences for
Bulgarian wine.'
Politics - and economics - are less fully handled than most other
disciplines in the interdisciplinary mix, although there is an article (all
too brief) on taxation and scholarly articles on investment in wine and on
auctions. There might well have been an article on Gladstone, who cut taxes
on French wines, and when we reach the 20th century there is too little on
the retailing and pricing of wines and on the changing roles of stores,
chains and supermarkets.
There is little, too, about competition from other alcoholic beverages not
based on the grape or about soft drinks and mixers. Aperitifs have an entry,
but there is no reference to cocktails, and while aquardente and aquardiente
are mentioned and there are long articles on armagnac and cognac (the latter
making one cross reference to vodka), there is no sign of calvados, whisky,
beer or, for that matter, black velvet. A brief article on alcohol makes the
point that 'the alcohol content in a perfectly balanced wine should be
unfathomable'.
The articles on food and wine are sketchy, too, but the place of science
both in viticulture and in vinification is handled in expert fashion, and
the brief article on traditions ends with the comforting words that
'traditions are likely to have evolved for a reason, often one that is
eventually explained by science'.
The article on 'training systems' that follows almost immediately is
concerned solely with vines, not people.
The first two entries in the volume are abboccato and abocado, medium sweet,
and we are directed to the article on sweetness. In the absence of an index
such direction is all, but no one interested in wine should miss the aroma
wheel on pages 58 to 59.
Not all writers on wine could be described as medium sweet, but all those
whom Jancis Robinson has recruited to make this volume such a good
companion, a companion for all times, deserve a collective toast.
Unfortunately, it must be taken from outside the volume, where under 'toast'
we read only that 'toast given to a barrel when forming it over a heat
source, is one of the processes in barrel making that most obviously affect
eventual wine flavour'. Roll out the barrel.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Vengeance exposed - PD James rises to a creative
challenge / Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORIGINAL SIN by PD James Faber Pounds 14.99, 432 pages
The sin at the heart of PD James' new novel is a callous act of betrayal
committed many years ago, before most of her characters were born. It is a
book in which she reveals an almost Oedipal sense of the inescapability of
the past, while remaining too complex a moralist to endorse notions of
pre-destination or determinism.
The epic tragedy which unfolds in Original Sin is a warning against
vengeance, whose blind rhetoric is exposed at the end of the novel as a
destructive force beyond the control of those who unleash it. Lives are
lost, careers destroyed, because of one character's literal acting out of an
Old Testament view of justice as a means of enforcing equality of suffering.
That a detective novel should be discussed in these terms is an apparent
vindication of James's argument that the form is flexible enough to contain
the moral subtlety and fine writing more usually associated with literary
fiction. At the same time, it has to be said that few authors who write this
type of fiction come anywhere near approaching James's degree of
accomplishment.
In her case, the boundaries of the genre appear to act both as a comfortable
framework and a creative challenge. Original Sin slyly replays some of the
cliches of Golden Age detective fiction, from a closed circle of suspects -
the partners in an ailing publishing house based in a mock-Venetian palazzo
on the Thames - to a locked-room mystery which only gradually-reveals its
fictional and historic antecedents.
James has always revelled in plots of startling intricacy which she manages
to unfold without intruding her authorial presence. In Original Sin she
writes cinematically, beginning with a series of brief, vivid scenes in
which a temporary secretary arrives at the Peverell Press and observes not
just its architectural magnificence but the discontents among the staff. The
company's chairman has recently died (of old age, unlike the deaths which
swiftly follow) and been succeeded by Gerard Etienne, the ruthless son of
his French business partner.
Gerard is planning sweeping changes, among them the sale of the palazzo,
ironically named Innocent House, to a property developer. Shortly after a
bad-tempered board meeting he is found dead in a poky upstairs office, his
corpse garishly presented: half-clothed and with a draught-excluder in the
shape of a snake (known in the company as Hissing Sid) wound round his neck,
its head jammed into his mouth.
The image is grotesque, pantomimic, yet without in any way undoing the
horror of the scene. Later in the book, when another victim is shown
struggling and failing to escape the gruesome death planned by the same
killer, James's contribution to detective fiction becomes clear. Where
Agatha Christie or Dorothy L Sayers or John Dickson Carr used violent death
as a device, the enabling act which set the plot in motion, James aims for
an emotional authenticity which restores its chilling, unforgiving finality.
Murder for her is an outrage, a rent in the social fabric which the forces
of law and order - represented in this novel by her Scotland Yard detective
Adam Dalgliesh and his assistants - struggle not so much to mend as to
limit. In Original Sin, the impossibility of the task comes close to
overwhelming them, producing a black, bitter finale which casts a baleful
light on the conventional romance acted out by two of the surviving
characters. James's finest novel to date, Original Sin exposes the harsh
fallibility of human vengeance in a world where the ideal of divine justice,
though attractive to Dalgliesh - and I suspect, his creator - may also prove
illusory.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Travel: Adrift in bliss between sea, sky and land - Kayaking
off the coast of Maine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among Yankee New Englanders, a tribe generally known for its taciturnity,
the people of Maine are supposed to be the most taciturn of all. Bemused
contemplation of 'outta-state folks' is said to be their pleasure, the
monosyllabic response their forte - 'Nope . . .', or 'Yup . . .' are
supposed to be just about all a Down-easter feels inclined to say at any one
time. But it was not that way at the Bailey Island General Store when I
walked in one afternoon.
Bailey Island sits at the end of a narrow finger of land - one of several
collectively known as The Harpswells - that stick far out into Casco Bay
north of Portland. It is hardly a major attraction. It has none of the
summer mass tourism of Old Orchard Beach further down the coast, none of the
moneyed, old-family cachet of Bar Harbour further up the coast. It is a
hardy rural community, spread out along a treed and rocky coastline, that
lives primarily by lobstering. Endless backwoods colloquy, however, appears
to come a close second.
I sat at the counter in the general store long after the blueberry muffins
and coffee I had ordered were finished. It was not the community
notice-board (Ed's Trucking - you call, we haul) that kept me lingering.
Neither was it the pot-bellied wood stove, extinguished since last winter,
nor the rack where general store habitues kept their own name-labeled coffee
mugs.
It was the habitues themselves, a clutch of flannel-shirted, baseball-hatted
duffers gathered in favourite chairs at the end of the counter. I had never
heard crustier, longer-winded griping in my life.
Nothing was right with the world. The lobster season had gone all to hell,
volunteered one coffee drinker. This was worth an emotional 20 minutes
moaning. Hunting was not what it used to be, someone else threw in, and that
was good for a 10-minute whinge. Something had got into the pumpkins this
year, cackled a third, and they all got going on the woeful state of
vegetable gardening. The local economy drew no less cynical a reaction:
'Well of course they can say the recession is over. Your cat can have
kittens in the oven and you can say they're biscuits, but it don't
necessarily make 'em so.'
On and on it went. The baseball strike, the weather, the price of plywood,
those damn-fool environmentalists from Washington. Life in Maine of late, it
was roundly concluded with a Great North Woods flourish, was hardly worth a
raccoon dropping.
I was about to step out convinced there was nothing at all that Mainers
could discuss happily, when someone brought up the subject of a recent canoe
trip he had taken. Almost instantly the atmosphere changed - there were
smiles, good natured anecdotes, discussions of the best routes, the best
techniques, the best camping sites. Suddenly happy days had returned. I left
feeling intrigued: if canoeing in Maine was something that could make this
crowd happy, then it was something worth investigating.
Not five minutes away, at the foot of the stone bridge leading on to Bailey
Island, I was brought to a halt. Sitting on a wharf overlooking the
wind-ruffled water of Harpswell Sound were a rack of brightly-coloured,
strange looking craft. They seemed an odd mix between canoe and whitewater
kayak. Where a canoe is high and open they were low and decked; where a
kayak is short and stubby, they were long and narrow.
They were in fact, sea kayaks, one of the most elegant and graceful one-man
ocean craft around. I fell for them instantly. This was better even than
plain canoeing. In five minutes I had introduced myself to Jeff Cooper,
owner of the kayaks and proprietor of H20 Outfitters. Not only did we agree
to meet for a bite that evening, but also arranged a day of sea kayaking.
In The Happy Isles of Oceana - Paddling the Pacific Paul Theroux recounts an
island-hopping trip he took from Australia across the Pacific to New
Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands, Easter Island
and Hawaii. Accompanying him were two large canvas sacks - the separate
halves of the sea kayak he assembled wherever the whim took him. And it took
him often: the trip was something of an escape from an unhappy part of his
life, the paddling a sort of therapy.
There was nothing unhappy about Cooper - there is a constant twinkle of
humour in his eye. Nor did he feel the need to escape quite as far as the
south Pacific. But as he told me that evening over a swordfish and scallop
dinner with his wife Cathy, Maine is his escape and sea kayaking his life.
For beauty and enjoyment he is not even sure that he would trade the Pacific
for the rock and pine-covered coast of northern New England.
After 11 years here, Cooper cannot imagine returning to urban Pennsylvania.
'Old college friends sometimes call me up,' he laughed. 'They have MBAs, big
businesses, big cars, big stress. I have some canoes and a big white
Pyrenean dog. We are so different now it is hard to have a normal
conversation. I teach sea kayaking, Cathy teaches canoeing and skiing for LL
Bean's Discovery programme. It is not hard to fall for outdoors Maine;
you'll see tomorrow.'
I sat up that night on the porch of the ancient Driftwood Inn, a wonderfully
unfashionable place of creaky floorboards and rusty bathtub water, imagining
my own escape to a fishing community on the coast of Maine.
Below the inn, the tide swirled and gurgled as it began its 12ft climb up
the rough granite sides of Bailey Island. A night bird hooted from the
spruce woods across a stretch of water. The moon rose. Miles out to sea,
steaming south to Portland from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, the ferry-boat Bay of
Fundy slipped away in a dim twinkle of lights. It would certainly be a
different way to look at life I thought as, bed-bound, I too slipped away.
But the best way to look at life in this part of the world, I realised a few
hours later, is from out at sea, in a low-riding, swell-hugging kayak.
With a small group I spent the morning in calm water near the wharf learning
basic sea-kayaking techniques: the double-ended paddle, the knee-squeezing
narrowness of the hull, the awkwardness of entry and exit, the closeness to
the water surface - all took some getting used to. So, too, did the fluid,
hip-swivelling paddling motion that Cooper made look so easy; on prolonged
sea-kayaking trips it is this graceful movement that saves vital energy and
wear and tear on arms.
By lunchtime though, with several capsizings behind us, we all felt
confident enough to propel our craft under the stone bridge against a rising
tide, through a set of narrows, and out into the open water.
It was a soft, hazy day, the kind on which the sun is barely discernible and
the precise line between sea and sky disappears. There was no wind and the
air was warm, but an occasional, inexpert dipping of my fingers below the
water reminded me that this was no south sea - far from the Gulf Stream,
Maine coastal waters remain cold all year.
Along the rocks, large herring gulls swooped in and out from stony perches
over the water. Cormorants dived, disappeared, shot up unexpectedly and
dived again. On the way out to Pond Island, running a course among a
thousand bobbing lobster buoys, we were joined by a party of seals; curious
enough to stop robbing bait from the lobster pots below, they followed us
for a mile or so.
How much nicer to be out here looking in, I though as we paddled silently
past the Driftwood Inn. Houses, forests, rocky promontories and deep coves
came and went, all the more attractive for the broad seascape they sat
behind. Closer in, I drifted to that restless place where water meets land,
surging in among the swirling kelp, feeling the pull of the swell on the
rocks. Exhilarated, I found myself gulping down great lungfuls of air and
wishing it would never end.
Real sea-kayakers pack their craft with water, food and camping gear and
disappear for days at a time. I had done just one circuit of one small
island. But there is nothing, I decided, like seeing life from barnacle
level.
Given the chance that afternoon of paddling a few more of the happy isles of
Maine I could have had just one answer. 'Yup.'
There are a number of companies that will rent sea-kayaks along the Maine
coast with few questions asked. Sea conditions often change rapidly,
however, and extreme caution is required; novices are advised to take basic
instruction. Jeff Cooper may be contacted at H20 Outfitters, PO Box 72,
Orr's Island, Maine 04066, tel (207) 833 5257.
In Britain information on sea-kayaking clubs and courses may be obtained
from British Canoe Union, John Dudderidge House, Adbolton Lane, West
Bridgford, Nottingham NG2 5AS, tel 0602-821100.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Truth of the Matter: Only victims have the right to forgive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH DICKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Years ago, the vicar of a London parish was beaten by thugs in his own house
and his daughter attacked and raped before his eyes.
Shortly afterwards he appeared on TV and announced that he forgave his
assailants. There was public admiration for such high-minded Christian
charity.
But some of us felt uneasy. The cynic in us thinks it is just what he would
have to say if he was going to keep any self-respect as a Christian
minister.
But then I found myself pondering why it felt so different when a father who
had seen his daughter blown to pieces by the IRA spoke so movingly about
forgiveness and pleaded that there should be no revenge. Was it that one was
a private tragedy, the other a wound to a whole community ?
These are tangled issues, but I have a gut feeling that we must explore
them. Behind them loom much deeper waters about the transactions communities
and nations need to engage in if they are to steer a course out of vengeance
into reconciliation.
In my trade we spend much time trying to help individuals and families find
ways out of personal conflict. Is any of that experience transferable into
the arena of international affairs? There, I suspect, we are all out of our
depth. But for what they are worth there may be some pointers.
For one thing, I cannot forgive an assailant if he is not around to be
forgiven and if he has not asked for forgiveness and given some signs of
genuine contrition.
Time has to pass. The rage and anger has to be processed somewhere and
somehow or it will seep out in displaced responses to other people and other
situations.
And the daughter? I cannot forgive her assailant. Only the victim can
forgive. No one else is entitled to. Only after she has reached the point
where she can stretch out a hand am I entitled to do the same.
I may want to persuade her to, for, gross as the injury has been, part of
her own healing process must lie in letting the poison go. By nursing our
wounds we may turn our backs on healing them. The future is more important
than the past.
If forgiveness at the personal level is more complex and intractable than a
glib Christian precept sometimes makes it seem, forgiveness at the community
or national level is far more perplexing. Yet if nations and communities are
not to live embattled in age-old feuds and poisoned by past traumas we have
to find some way of enabling a process akin to forgiveness to be transacted.
But how? How does a nation forgive? There can be no forgiveness without
repentance. How does a nation repent?
The first step must be to tell and acknowledge the truth, not just the facts
about the trauma and loss which have been inflicted, but a truthful
recognition of the feelings of horror and grief and pain.
Peoples who have suffered must feel that their pain has been felt and
responsibility for it accepted by the other side. There must be no excuses,
no explanations, no glib political prevarications.
Not for the first time the eyes of nations are fixed once again on South
Africa. Since the 1950s South Africa was the international paradigm of gross
oppression, destroying its own black citizens by the thousand.
Now, South Africa is groping its way towards reconciliation and forgiveness.
How far this is the direct influence of men such as Trevor Huddleston and
Desmond Tutu and how far it is due to a natural generosity in the African
character we shall never know. But some of it is due to the acceptance by
the ANC and the nationalists that there is no other way out of the impending
bloodbath. They recognise that the future is more important than the past.
They know their fates are bound together. And they are pragmatists not
ideologues. Ideology is the death of peace.
In Nelson Mandela they have a statesman of global stature with a clear
understanding of what must be done to achieve reconciliation. No concealment
of past atrocities; the terrible truth must be told. An amnesty, perhaps,
for all but the most wicked, conditional maybe on admission of guilt and
reparations. Of course no reparation can bring back the dead or remake
shattered lives, but, even if inadequate, it can still be a token of a
change of heart to which a generous response may be made.
Generosity is of the essence. Mandela himself has been a victim, a man
brought back from the brink of execution, his best years destroyed. He has
the right to choose to forgive and to provide a paradigm for his people to
lead them away from the abyss. 'In victory, magnanimity.'
Such a stance requires considerable political courage.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is one of the few western leaders to have
had the courage to ask for forgiveness for his people. But it would not have
been realistic if there had not been a groundswell of public opinion which
felt guilt and shame for the years of the Third Reich.
The next question is more difficult. When and how do we forgive? When do the
Jews forgive? When do the Unionists forgive? When do the Irish forgive the
British? When do the Bosnians, Serbs and Croats forgive?
Nations and communities are not good at repenting - yet if we do not find a
way to repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation, our ancient and more
recent wounds will remain running sores and our children's children will be
caught up in these vicious cycles of unforgiving violence and revenge which
threaten to overwhelm us all.
A nation with no history is like a man who has lost his memory; our national
identity is forged in the telling of our history. But, if the core of our
national consciousness is welded only from an obsessive picking over the
fragments of past injustices and trauma, or from the mythic triumph of
battles long ago, the past holds us in fetters.
We cannot reach out to make a new and peaceful future for our children to
live in as long as we are constantly showing repeats of films about past
wars. The images of war offer no solutions except more violence to the
problems of traumatised and hostile peoples.
How can we go about it?
The terrible truths must be exposed. Reparations must be agreed. But then
statesmen must speak for nations words which nations cannot speak. Stories
must be told. Journalists and editors must take risks with their congenital
cynicism to say the unsayable. The media have a huge responsibility for
shifting public attitudes. Images of generosity must be sought and held up
to the public gaze.
One such I heard from Archbishop Trevor Huddleston.
With his permission I tell it here.
The archbishop was an honoured guest at Mandela's inauguration. He was
lodged in a guarded hotel with other heads of state, for he, like Mandela,
is at constant risk of assassination. He rose early one morning and went out
to say mass on the arm of his minder for he is now physically frail.
From his room he had to walk along a passageway at the end of which was an
armed guard. As they approached him the man stepped forward and saluted. He
asked if he could touch the archbishop's arm. From his accent it was clear
that he was an Afrikaner. In his guttural English, he said quietly: 'I am so
sorry. I am so sorry for what we have done to your people. I am so sorry.'
The archbishop held his hand, and replied: 'But now we are all one people;
black and white and coloured and English and Afrikaner. We are all equal
citizens of the new South Africa. Our future is together.'
'Ach no,' said the soldier. 'You do not understand. I have done terrible
things. Terrible, truly terrible. But I heard your voice on the radio and my
heart changed.' Then, hesitantly, as if he expected the request to be
refused: 'Father, will you bless me?' So he knelt and the new South Africa
forgave the old.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Barbie - the virgin queen of a plastic paradise - The
world's most famous doll is 35 but never ages / A look back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been quite a year for Barbie, the most popular doll in history. Born
on March 9 1959, her 35th birthday has been celebrated all over the world;
Columbia Studios is bidding for the rights to make her a film star; and
Sheik Khaled Al Madkour, president of a committee in Kuwait City which
advises the government on religious issues, has declared that to buy her is
forbidden by Islam.
There is no such veto in Monte Carlo where the National Museum is hosting an
exhibition in her honour. It is drawn from the collection of one person:
Jean-Pierre Icardo, an office worker from Nice who has 'between 700 and 800'
Barbie dolls. Now 40, he first saw Barbie in 1964, the year she was
introduced to France. He has been her faithful admirer ever since.
As a child, Icardo was enchanted by all forms of decoration and wanted to
work in the theatre or cinema. As he grew up, he made his own theatrical
tableaux at home and put on entertainments for his friends, using dolls as
actors. But traditional dolls were stiff and it was not possible to dress or
pose them satisfactorily. Barbie, with her long legs, slim body and
beautiful outfits, was the perfect solution. 'I fell in love,' he says,
simply.
After attending Nice University, he took an office job and continued to
weave his theatrical dreams at home, always with Barbie as his star. His
collection grew slowly: the dolls were expensive and his mother saved up to
buy them for him as birthday and Christmas gifts. 'I believed I was unique,'
he says. 'I had no idea there were other grown-ups who were collecting.'
In March 1984, though, a convention of doll and automata collectors was held
in Monaco. Icardo and his mother went along and were astonished to find all
the paraphernalia of an established Barbie collectors' market, including
books with descriptions of the dolls and how to recognise their ages and
dates. In fact, adult collecting of Barbie began in the US in the 1970s and
the first Barbie encyclopaedia was written in 1975. Now, there are Barbie
conventions every year.
Collectors often specialise, some buying only Barbie and shunning her family
and friends, some buying only Barbies from the 1960s, now the most expensive
period. Icardo tries to collect everything from 1964 onwards, conceding that
his collection grows 'only very slowly - the world of Barbie is so huge'.
Mattel, the company that created Barbie, makes limited editions especially
for the collectors' market. Unique examples of older or special dolls, such
as the very early versions made in ivory white plastic, now change hands for
up to Dollars 4,000.
Icardo's devotion extends to Barbie's friends and relations. This year, he
told me, is also the 30th anniversary of her sister Skipper. Her best
friend, Midge, will have her 30th anniversary next year. Ken, Barbie's
faithful consort, was born in 1961. 'But she will never marry Ken,' Icardo
insists. 'She must stay the young teenager for ever.'
When first launched, Barbie was not popular with parents who, rather like
Sheikh Khaled, thought her 'too sexy'. Her popularity with young girls was
instant, however, and there are thought to be 700m of her worldwide. Today,
Barbie and Ken lead a hectic life as their clothes, make-up and hair styles
change constantly with the times: last year alone, Barbie had 100 outfits
from which to choose.
While Barbie's unique proportions have never changed, Ken has been altered
several times. His earliest skinny body has been made bigger and his fragile
flock velvet hair (now much prized if found in pristine condition) replaced
with more practical paint or, for special occasions, wigs.
Their world, too, has expanded from homely junior proms and fraternity
meetings to a frantic round of globe-trotting and activities that include
every kind of sport, making television programmes and even ballet dancing.
Barbie's circle of friends reflects a changing America. Her first black
friend, a girl doll dating from the mid-1960s, was followed by the grown-up
Brad in 1970 and Cara and Curtis in 1975. The first Hispanic and Asiatic
friends appeared in the 1980s and an American Indian was added to the circle
recently.
The all-American girl has only recently been made at home, though.
Originally manufactured in Japan from 1959, Barbie's production cycle has
followed the global trail of multi-national investment and new sources of
cheap labour. She is now made at 15 locations in seven countries: Mexico,
China, Malaysia, Indonesia, UK and Italy, as well as the US.
Some Barbies were produced briefly under licence in various countries, so
allowing regional differences to creep in; this resulted in her being more
sun-tanned in Spain and smaller, with huge cartoon-style eyes, in Japan. But
this has been stopped and uniformity reigns. Icardo considers this 'very
sad'.
Barbie, of course, is not just a pretty face. When I expressed a certain
envy of her lifestyle, and pointed out that she never had to work for a
living, Icardo was quick to disagree. 'She always works,' he said. 'She has
been a model and a singer. This year, she was a doctor. She and Ken have
been in the army, taking part in Desert Storm; and in the 1960s, the great
days of Nasa, she was an astronaut.'
This year's Christmas model will talk and answer questions; one released
earlier swims and dives. Truly, she is a superwoman 'at the centre of her
world', as Icardo puts it. Perhaps, though, it takes another woman to spot a
few snags.
To me, it seems obvious that, as she approaches 40, Barbie faces the same
problems as the women who have tried to emulate her - success, fame, and
glamour do not necessarily bring fulfilment. And few of them have made her
supreme sacrifice. For Barbie - astronaut, soldier, fashion icon - has never
had sex. Forever dreaming of romantic weddings - dresses for which feature
among her sister's outfits, if not her own - her relationship remains
unconsummated.
Despite the sexual message of her appearance - huge breasts, heavy make-up,
ever more sophisticated clothes - Barbie must remain untouched. She is an
Eve who cannot fall, in a paradise filled not with flowers and fruit but
with products. The message she brings is to look, to dream - and then, to
buy.
La Poupee Barbie, Anniversaire a Monaco, continues at the Musee National de
Monaco, 17, Avenue Princesse Grace, Monte Carlo, until September 30. Barbie
can also be seen with 33 outfits specially made for her by top French
couturiers at the Musee Grevin, Paris, until December 31.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The pull of star vehicles - Tim
Minogue meets an entrepreneur who saw a niche for big cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM MINOGUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once, stretch limousines, the unfeasibly long Cadillacs which are the
transportation of choice for film stars, supermodels and movie gangsters,
were rarely seen outside Manhattan and Los Angeles. Now they are an
increasingly common sight in London, in part because of the success of
Limco, a limousine-hire business based in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.
The idea that Britons might take to being chauffeured in 30ft, three-ton
monsters with shag-pile carpeting, white leather upholstery, smoked glass
windows, bar, refrigerator, TV, telephone and video came to Les Barnes,
managing director of Limco, four years ago during a visit to New York.
Barnes, 45, and Chris Thorn, 48, had been partners since 1978 in a much less
glamorous enterprise, Cheshunt Contractors Plant, engaged in groundworks on
building sites - excavation, drain laying and the like. But by the end of
the 1980s, with the construction industry in recession, business was
deteriorating.
'We were suffering very badly, with no prospect of improvement,' says
Barnes. 'We had to look for something completely different. I had seen the
chauffeured limos in New York and thought 'if it can work there, it can work
here'.'
Having decided to get out of building, Barnes and Thorn could not sell their
17 heavy earth-moving machines, worth Pounds 150,000 on paper, and had to
scrap the lot for just Pounds 2,000. The building boom of the 1980s had been
kind to them while it lasted, however. They both owned large homes which
they were able to remortgage, raising Pounds 80,000 from Barclays Bank
towards the cost of two stretched Cadillacs which were shipped from the US
in 1991.
Barnes believed that the limousines, with their huge seating capacity (the
smallest seats eight) would appeal to 'customers who wanted something
special, unlike any other limo'. These days celebrities attending London
film premieres often hire a stretch from Limco rather than a conventional
limousine such as a Daimler - what Barnes calls 'Co-op funeral cars'.
Famous names driven by Limco have included Liz Taylor, Sylvester Stallone,
David Bowie and Muhammad Ali. The footballer Paul Gascoigne, a Hertfordshire
resident, uses Limco much as others would a local minicab service.
What surprised Barnes was the enthusiasm with which non-celebrity customers
embraced the concept of big nights out in magnificently vulgar style. Twenty
per cent of Limco's business is corporate, but the rest is private hire,
mostly 'ordinary people out for a good time': birthdays, anniversaries, hen
and stag nights, at Pounds 30 an hour (minimum four hours) plus VAT.
Barnes says: 'We're selling the image of the glamorous, showbizzy lifestyle,
if only for an evening.'
Limco's fleet consists of four Cadillacs and four Lincolns. Barnes says
demand justifies adding another five cars next year, including a 33ft
'super-stretch'. Expansion, however, has been curbed by the reluctance of
finance houses to supply credit for the purchase of such exotic beasts.
Barnes says: 'We have had to buy all our cars so far, except for the first
three, with money up front, despite having a perfect credit rating. As soon
as you mention American vehicles, lenders run a mile.'
Valuation data is hard to come by on such cars, and lenders assume -
wrongly, says Barnes - that they have little resale value in the UK. Limco
is negotiating with Ford Credit, about borrowing up to Pounds 250,000 of the
Pounds 400,000 cost of the new vehicles.
Barnes concedes that finance companies may fear that the stretch limousine
craze is mere flashiness in the pan. 'We have grown very quickly and lenders
are wary of firms with rapid growth. They think the bubble will burst.'
Profits are nudging Pounds 100,000 per annum on a turnover of around Pounds
320,000, up from a profit of Pounds 2,000 on a Pounds 74,000 turnover in the
first year.
'We based our unit costs on the expectation that each car would be on the
road for 20 to 25 hours a week,' says Barnes. 'In fact, demand has been much
greater than we imagined. The cars average 40 hours each. That level of
usage drives the unit costs down and the profits up. At the moment we are
turning down about 40 or 50 hours worth of bookings every week, because we
haven't got the cars.'
Barnes says: 'We're giving people a taste of how the other half lives. When
you hire one of these, it's a party from the moment you get in.'
He says 'anything goes' in the back of his cars, although women on hen party
outings are not encouraged to climb through the sunroof and bare their
breasts, as has happened on more than one occasion.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Fast way to explore your files: David Carter reviews
Magellan - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID CARTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once in a while I come across a software package and think: 'This package is
terrific. Why isn't everyone talking about it?' That's my feeling about
Magellan.
Magellan is a 'file management' package from Lotus, producer of the 1-2-3
spreadsheet. It runs under DOS or Windows; price Pounds 115. Magellan will
benefit anyone who has a large number of files on their hard disk and needs
to keep track of them and keep them organised. I use Magellan constantly.
The problem for anyone who does a lot of word processing or spreadsheet work
is that over time they build up a large number of files - letters, reports,
worksheets, etc - on their hard disk. Such documents are saved under cryptic
DOS filenames such as 'JIM. DOC' or 'TAXMAN. WPS'.
This is no problem at first, but as time goes on you run out of meaningful
filenames to remind you what the document is about. Consequently, a year or
two down the line your hard disk becomes cluttered up with lots of redundant
files which really ought to be cleared off and the space made reusable, but
you cannot remember what they were about so it is not safe to delete them.
When this happens you need to be able to go past the name of the file and
take a look at what is inside. Enter Magellan. Its 'viewer' facility allows
you to go into any document and display the contents on the screen.
Unlike the more technically oriented file management packages such as Norton
Utilities or PC Tools, Magellan is designed for the ordinary user who has
masses of information locked away in files on his or her disk and wants to
navigate around and 'explore' them as easily as possible. Hence its name.
Magellan splits the screen into two. On the left are listed the directories
on your disk. One of them will be highlighted. In the right hand part of the
screen Magellan displays the contents of the highlighted directory.
As you work your way down the list, Magellan displays the contents of each
file being highlighted. It is as if you were in the index at the back of a
book. On the left page your thumb is on the first entry of the index. As you
move your thumb down each entry in the left page of the index, complete
pictures of the pages being referred to are displayed simultaneously on the
right page.
Simply by using the four arrow keys on your keyboard, you can find and
display any document on your hard disk within seconds. And the more files
and directories there are, the better it gets. On a network, for example,
Magellan gives you a list of all the local drives, and with just a few
keystrokes you can see into any file on any machine. This is the definitive
way to find your way around hundreds or thousands of data files.
Magellan also contains many more useful features. Copying and moving files
is far easier and safer than under DOS, for example.
When you are installing Magellan, it will ask you if you want to create an
index on your files. The program may take an hour to create the index, but
it will enable you to make lightning-fast searches of your disk.
I recently wanted to find a letter written a couple of years earlier. I
could not remember the name of the person I had written to, nor the company.
However, I knew they were based in Edinburgh. I chose F9 to explore, pressed
right arrow twice, typed in 'EDINBURGH' and pressed enter. Within 10 seconds
Magellan had searched through 1,600 files taking up 30 megabytes of data and
come up with a list of all the documents containing the word 'Edinburgh'.
Complex searches are similarly quick. People pay thousands of pounds for
specialist text retrieval packages to do this sort of thing: with Magellan
it is thrown in for nothing.
As hard disks grow bigger and bigger, it becomes more and more important to
have help navigating around them. Magellan is the answer. In particular, for
anyone whose computer is several years old with a hard disk that has become
cluttered up with half-forgotten documents which need to be cleared off, it
is indispensable.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Nature of Things: Writing with atoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new generation of microscopes, more powerful than scientists would have
believed possible before the 1980s, is enabling researchers not only to
'see' individual atoms but also to pick them up and move them around.
These microscopes will be vital instruments for the coming era of
'nanotechnology', in which miniaturisation will produce atomic-scale
structures thousands of times smaller than those used in microelectronics
today. On that scale, all the words in the Bible could be written on the
point of a pin.
(A brief explanation of the terminology used in nanotechnology: the word
comes from the Greek nanos for dwarf. The fundamental unit of the field is
the nanometre, one billionth of a metre.)
The first of the new instruments, the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope, was
invented in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at the Swiss
laboratories of IBM, the American computer group. The STM was a wonderful
leap of scientific imagination, recognised unusually promptly with a Nobel
Prize for Physics in 1986.
Conventional microscopes work by focusing beams of radiation or particles.
Optical instruments are limited by the wavelength of visible light, which is
about 500nm; even a perfect lens cannot focus on a point smaller than this,
so they cannot see atoms. To achieve greater resolving power, microscopists
moved to electron beams and X-rays, which have much shorter wavelengths, but
they use penetrating high-energy radiation which is unsuitable for imaging
atoms on surfaces.
Binnig and Rohrer decided to use 'electron tunnelling', one of the slightly
bizarre consequences of quantum theory. When a low voltage is applied to two
conducting materials which are extremely close together but not touching,
electrons 'tunnel' through the gap; the resulting electric current is highly
sensitive to the distance between them.
The instrument built by the IBM researchers had a stylus with the sharpest
possible tip - a single atom - which scanned a metal surface. The variations
in tunnelling current revealed the ups and downs of the atoms on the
surface.
The STM could only give images of materials that conduct electricity. The
next step was the Atomic Force Microscope invented by Binnig and colleagues
in 1985 to look at non-conducting materials. The AFM scans a tip attached to
a thin metal cantilever across the sample, and gives an image based simply
on the repulsive forces between the atoms at the end of the tip and those on
the sample's surface.
More recently, the STM and AFM have spawned a variety of other instruments,
known generically as Scanning Probe Microscopes, which produce atomic images
based on thermal, magnetic, optical and other interactions between the tip
and sample. By speeding up the scanning rate, scientists have even made
'atomic movies', showing how atoms move around on heated surfaces.
An estimated 3,000 SPMs are now operating worldwide, for a vast range of
applications, and the number is increasing. Most are used for research into
surfaces, helping scientists understand processes such as corrosion. They
are also moving on to production lines in the electronics industry,
inspecting semiconductors and other materials for surface quality.
In biology, SPMs have imaged the double helix of the genetic material DNA
and distinguished the chemical 'letters' which hold our genetic code. If the
technique can be speeded sufficiently, it may be possible to read genes by
microscope, instead of using chemical-based analysis.
But much of the excitement about SPMs concerns their potential for
manipulating atoms. Researchers at IBM's Almaden laboratories in California
showed the way in 1990 when pushed atoms of xenon across a nickel surface
with an STM tip, one by one, and arranged them to spell the company's
initials in atomic letters 5nm high.
Such demonstrations show that, in principle, data could be stored in
ultra-compact 'atom-scale memories'.
Decades of work will be required to bring atom-scale devices based on SPMs
to practical fruition. In particular, the speed with which atoms are moved
and scanned will need to increase millions of times.
But it is far from certain that SPMs are the main route to an atom-scale
future. Alternative methods of nano-construction are already further
developed, such as laying down atoms by molecular beams in a vacuum. These
are less sensitive than SPMs but far faster.
The future for the new generation of microscopes may lie more in observing
nano-structures and assembling prototype devices than in mass production.
However they have transformed the way scientists see the world in miniature.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Picking the right pension - Personal
plans should be a last resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the finance industry's chief
regulator, explained this week how employees with personal pensions would be
compensated if their plan was sold on the basis of bad advice (see page
III). But while it stressed there was nothing wrong intrinsically with
personal pensions as a product, you should remember that these plans were
introduced for the self-employed and for staff without access to a company
scheme. They were never intended to replace company pension arrangements.
The following guide could help you choose the right pension for your
circumstances.
Q: Should I leave my company scheme for a personal pension? No. If you are
in, or have access to, a company scheme that links the value of the pension
to your final salary, offers death-in-service benefits and disability
pensions, then you should stay put. If the pension is not salary-linked,
check exactly what you get for your contributions. Q: What about senior
executives? In certain cases, a senior executive who has built up a
substantial fund could gain more flexibility over the pension income, and
the investment of the fund in retirement, if he switches to a personal plan.
But this is a complex area and professional, independent advice must be
sought. Q: I have changed jobs. Should I transfer my former company scheme
benefits to a personal pension? Probably not. In most cases, your pension
will be worth more if you leave it with your former employer. This is called
a 'deferred' pension because payment is deferred or postponed until you
retire. Remember that any transfer costs money, except where employees
change jobs within the public sector.
If, for some reason, it is necessary to take your pension out of the old
scheme, then consider transferring it to your new employer's scheme if you
can. A personal plan should be regarded as a last resort.
By law, advisers and salesmen must compare all these options before making a
recommendation.
Q: I have been made redundant. Do I need to transfer my pension? No. Do
nothing in the short term unless you are forced to act - for example, where
the employer is insolvent. Even then, it could take time for the trustees or
liquidators to establish the value of your pension. Where the employer still
exists, the newly-redundant should leave their pensions in the old scheme at
least until all the options are known. Your next employer might offer an
excellent pension and it could be best to transfer to this scheme.
Q: There is no company scheme so I want a personal pension. For future
contributions, this might be the only option. But do seek independent
advice, preferably on a fee basis, and do not transfer benefits from old
schemes just for the sake of neatness.
Your adviser should explain the personal pension provider's charges and the
amount of commission, if any, that he gets. He should also consider the
financial strength of the provider and the performance and flexibility of
the plan.
You should, for example, be able to reduce and stop contributions and/or
retire early without penalty.
Q. There is a company scheme but I may change jobs after a few years. Some
careers lead to frequent job changes and periods of self-employment, so it
is important to ask the pension manager or trade union what will happen to
your company pension if you leave.
Provided you expect to stay for more than two years, the company scheme is
likely to be best, particularly if it offers good family protection benefits
if you die. If you do want a personal plan to take with you from job to job,
choose with care and make sure the plan is genuinely portable (see above).
Q. What if I want to retire early or my employer has a habit of enforcing
early retirement? You should still join the company scheme. If you face
early retirement, you should top up your pension by paying additional
voluntary contributions (AVCs), provided by the company scheme, or take out
a free-standing AVC (FSAVC) plan sold by life offices and a few unit trust
groups. Company AVCs offer better value because the employer bears all or
most of the charges, but FSAVCs can offer a wider investment choice. If you
are interested in FSAVCs, seek independent advice.
Where to get advice. If you are not sure what benefits are provided in your
company scheme, contact the pensions manager or your trade union.

an employer's scheme. Send a large SAE marked 'Fact sheet' to the Securities

like boundary hedges - are a common problem between neighbours. Would it be
feasible to pay a neighbour to restrict the height or density of a hedge to
some agreed level, and to get that agreement to be binding on subsequent
owners?
It would certainly be possible to execute a restrictive covenant preventing
boundary hedges or trees being allowed to grow beyond a certain height. In
order to be binding, the covenant should be registered at the Land Registry
as a burden on the property on which the trees go and, if possible, as a
benefit on the neighbouring property. We suggest you contact a local
solicitor. (Murray Johnstone).

I am a 25 per cent taxpayer, and I hold a modest portfolio of blue-chip

Apart from new issues, it is not possible to transfer stock into a Pep. You
would, therefore, have to sell Pounds 12,000 worth of shares and re-invest
the proceeds for yourself and your wife. (Murray Johnstone).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My daughter has a certain amount of personal equity and is about to marry a
person with few resources. How can she can arrange her finances so that, if
her marriage fails, she does not lose capital in any settlement?
Your daughter and her fiance could enter a pre-nuptial contract providing
that, if the marriage ends in divorce or separation, her capital would not
be able to be shared. Such contracts are not strictly legally enforceable,
but any court would take its contents into account.
There is, also, the possibility of effecting a settlement by which your
daughter would transfer property from her ownership to those of trustees,
although this might well be impractical because of the expenses involved and
the small amount of property.
At the end of the day, though, marriage has to be a matter of trust and, if
there is the slightest doubt, the general advice would have to be - 'don't]'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Standard's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Customers who cash in long-term life insurance and pension policies after
just a few years are to be given higher surrender values by Standard Life,
the UK's largest mutual life insurer, from next year.
The company believes that knowing they will get a better deal if they have
to surrender will compensate customers for possibly having to accept a small
reduction in what they get when a policy reaches its full term.
Standard can offer these improved surrender values because it plans to
change how it pays commission to the agent or adviser selling the policy.
The company will finance the initial cost of paying commission - so the
adviser still gets his money - and take the total out of premiums over the
life of the policy instead of taking it all from the early premiums. It is
also cutting its margins so, in some cases, the maturity value will not fall
at all.
Surrender values across the life industry have come under heavy attack
because many people have been giving up policies early. Standard's changes
will coincide with the imminent new regulatory regime requiring life
companies and advisers to set out the surrender values in the first five
years of a policy, and to tell customers the commission paid to the sales
agent.
For a 25-year personal pension policy, where the investor pays Pounds 100 a
month and a 9 per cent annual rate of return is assumed, Standard's
surrender value after four years - when an investor would have paid Pounds
4,800 in premiums - will rise to Pounds 4,918 from Pounds 4,290. The
maturity value falls by Pounds 622 to Pounds 79,879.
In the case of an endowment, the improvements are even more marked.
At present, if a man of 29 took out a Standard Life unitised house purchase
endowment for a Pounds 50,000 loan over 25 years, and cashed it in after
four years, he would - assuming a 7.5 per cent annual rate of return - get
back just Pounds 3,062. This is less than the Pounds 3,953.28 he would have
paid in premiums.
Under the new system, though, he would get Pounds 3,967. And if he
maintained the policy for its full term, he would get Pounds 53,882 -
slightly more than at present.
Standard says only about 4 to 5 per cent of customers give up life policies
in the first few years - and it hopes better surrender values will not cause
this to rise.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Names get a boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   BY RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's Names do not need reminding about the perils of trading on the basis
of unlimited liability. This week, Citibank unveiled an innovative - but
inevitably complex - scheme that could offer existing members of the
insurance market a way of switching to limited liability for future trading.
The scheme, drawn up in conjunction with agents representing Names'
interests, could prove attractive. And while it would be impossible to buy
complete protection for liabilities arising on policies underwritten in the
past, Citibank's plan would, in effect, 're-insure' those liabilities into
an individual company for each Name - a NameCo.
At the same time, it would use a separate re-insurance deal to provide extra
funds at Lloyd's. This means that although companies are allowed generally
to underwrite policies worth twice the value of the funds they hold at
Lloyd's, the gearing of some NameCos could be boosted to 3:1.
Tax and other details have still to be thrashed out but the scheme has a
good chance of being approved by Lloyd's authorities, which appear to regard
the switch away from unlimited liability as inevitable and almost certainly
a good thing. Patrick Hanratty, a vice-president of Citibank, says
setting-up and running costs should not be 'onerous'.
Whether the scheme can offer real protection against losses incurred on past
policies will depend on the extent to which Lloyd's succeeds in subsuming
pre-1986 liabilities into NewCo, the company it has set up for that purpose.
Meanwhile, the timing of Citibank's announcement means few Names are likely
to be able to convert for the 1995 underwriting year. The road to conversion
is not going to be a high-speed freeway.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
People about to retire often face having to decide whether to take an
escalating annuity, which has a lower initial income, or accept the higher
initial pension offered by a level annuity, writes Peter Quinton of the
Annuity Bureau.
To avoid unfair advantage to either, life companies structure level and
escalating annuities to pay out the same amount in total gross income should
both run for their expected durations.
Based on a life expectancy of another 13 years, a man of 65 who opts for a 5
per cent escalation rate will receive about 35 per cent less income in the
first year than if he had bought a level annuity. This can be seen by
comparing the annuity tables this week and last in the Weekend FT. When he
reaches 73, he will be getting more from the escalating annuity than the
level annuity. By the time he is 79, he will have received the same gross
income under both.
Naturally, those who buy an escalating annuity and then live beyond their
normal life expectancy will be much better off than their level
counterparts. For every year lived after this time, the gap between the
total income offered by the two annuity types will continue to increase. A
joint life escalating annuity will - even after the buyer's death -
effectively secure a spouse's income until he or she dies.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                   TOP ANNUITY RATES
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump sum
investment.
The bulk of the fund built up by many types of pension plan must be used in
this way. This week's table shows compulsory purchase annuity rates. These
are used for small company schemes as well as additional voluntary
contribution (AVC) and free-standing AVC (FSAVC) plans, among others. This
week's rates include inflation-proofing.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Hot line to Opas - Calls to pension
advisory service rise 20% in year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Occupational pension schemes got a bad name after the Maxwell affair but,
given the excesses employed by personal pension scheme salesmen, the tables
have turned.
The number of inquiries handled by the Occupational Pensions Advisory
Service, the free state-assisted scheme to help people resolve their pension
problems, rose last year to 30,700 - a 20 per cent rise over 1992.
Chief executive Don Hall stressed, however, that more than 28,000 of these
were minor enquiries dealt with by a simple explanation. Difficult cases
needing detailed examination actually fell by 4 per cent to 2,397 - a tiny
fraction of the 20m or so occupational pension scheme members.
The most common problem areas were unclear membership conditions,
early-leaver benefits, early retirement and scheme wind-ups. In many cases,
the problem was caused by complicated language which confused members.
Transfers remained the largest single source of complaint. In one case, an
employee who was made redundant asked for details of his pension's transfer
value. After a delay, his company said it would be worth Pounds 48,000.
There was another delay when the employee asked for it to be transferred. He
then argued he had incurred investment loss. After Opas intervened, the
company agreed it had been at fault and increased the transfer value to
Pounds 52,000.
Another major problem area is insured schemes - those administered by an
insurance company - which tend to be the preserve of small companies.
Brian MacMahon, the Opas president, said proposals that smaller company
schemes should be regulated less rigorously than larger ones 'does not, in
(our) experience, make sense when so many of them are apparently badly run'.
Opas can also take enquiries about personal pensions as long as these are
not connected with their marketing or sale. And it produces free leaflets
designed to answer common problems.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Managers under the microscope - John
Cuthbert devises a new way to measure performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CUTHBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors and financial advisers are often prompted to put their money in a
particular unit trust by their perception of the management group's overall
performance. But there is little evidence that unit trust groups grow or
dwindle as a result of performance results alone - perhaps because investors
and advisers have no authoritative source of information about group
performance.
I have devised a simplistic but easy-to-understand way of looking at
management group performance. The method is called Management Group Value
Added, or MVA.
First, I adjust the performance of each of a group's funds for the riskiness
of its investment strategy. The MVA is then the proportion of a group's
funds whose risk-adjusted performance exceeds that of an appropriate
benchmark. It measures a group's ability to add value consistently. A group
with five funds, three of which exceeded the performance benchmark would,
therefore, achieve an MVA of 60 per cent.
MVA measures uses performance adjusted for risk because most people agree
that it is almost impossible for a manager to beat a benchmark consistently.
So, comparisons with benchmarks, such as the FT-SE-A All-Share index, are
powerful tests of performance.
MVA does have its drawbacks, though. Benchmark comparisons often can be
flawed if they are distorted by 'special' events: the effect of the Japan
market's long crash on the Tokyo Stock Exchange indices is a case in point.
And, where large numbers of funds are involved, the MVA percentage score
might have as much to do with a group's spread across a range of different
investment strategies, and the likelihood of their outperformance at
different stages of the economic cycle, as it does with managerial ability.
I have studied the MVA performances of 88 unit trust management groups; here
are some of the results. The smaller table shows the overall MVA scores
(without taking specialisation into account) of the 10 top-selling fund
firms of last year.
Column two shows the percentage results. Column three shows the number of
value-adding funds as a fraction of the total number of funds surveyed
within that group. MVA comparisons should always take these two columns
together.
This is particularly important in assessing Fidelity and M&amp;G; their large
fund ranges make comparisons with narrower benchmarks a fairer test.
Barclays Unicorn, Legal and General and Mercury also have wide ranges, but
remain poor performers on either comparison.
The larger table allows for specialisation by breaking down the overall
results for these groups into narrower investment categories.
My complete study (only part of which is discussed here) reveals that there
are 14 groups with zero MVA and a further 27 that have added value on only
one or two funds.
The study also reveals that the highest MVA scores are produced by small to
medium sized firms such as Baillie Gifford, Capel-Cure, Dunedin, Perpetual,
Schroder, St James and Stewart Ivory. All of these have cultivated
independent, distinctive management and analytical cultures plus an ability
to keep good managers.
The most important finding of all, however, is the revelation that there is
absolutely no relationship between the value of a group's funds under
management and its MVA performance. In other words, size and reputation
alone are no guide to a firm's investment abilities.
Among the top 10 fund firms by size, for instance, there are only two firms
that have MVA scores greater than the average. Indeed, Standard Life, until
recently the largest manager of unit trusts, has an MVA score of zero.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Learning the tricks of the trade -
Ever wondered where financial advisers get their know-how? Motoko Rich goes
on a training course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOKOTO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Harrington is a junior manager in an electronics firm who earns
Pounds 27,000 a year. Wife Diana left her job four years ago to bring up
their children, now aged two and six. Stephen has no death-in-service
benefits and the only life cover they have is a joint life endowment policy
covering their Pounds 40,000 mortgage. So what would Diana need if Stephen
was to die now?
While this might sound a morbid question, financial advisers deal with such
issues every day. And such questions are considered protective, not morbid.
This week, I was invited - along with five other journalists and a press
officer - to consider the life industry's perspective during a two-day
course for trainee sales agents at Legal &amp; General. Sealed off from the
world in a converted country residence at Kingswood, a village in Surrey, we
reviewed a range of subjects including regulation, taxation, mortgages, life
assurance and pensions.
When I decided to attend the course, I was sceptical; for the industry has
not earned a particularly trustworthy reputation in recent times. During the
past year alone, several life offices - including L&amp;G - have been fined by
Lautro, the industry regulator, for a failure to control their sales forces.
Then, too, there was this week's announcement of action by the Securities
and Investments Board over mis-selling of personal pensions. So, it has been
easy to wonder if training methods have, at least in part, been to blame for
the industry's problems.
Finally, as a potential consumer, I wanted to see what sales staff were
taught to do before trying to part people from their money. Was it just a
big con?
It turned out that this was not true. Equally, though, if consumers do not
have the chance to attend such courses - and most do not - they could well
be conned. For the basic assumption of the entire L&amp;G course  - and the
industry - is that all the services an insurance company offers do fulfil
genuine needs. This, most certainly, is not always the case.
This basic principle was introduced at the outset of the course. Mike, one
of two earnest trainers, launched it with a session on 'the need for
financial services'. He asked us to fill in the first of many work sheets;
this one listed financial commitments for eight stages of life, signposted
by conventional institutions such as home ownership, marriage, children and
retirement.
Then, we were asked to fill in a column marked: 'What Could Go Wrong'. From
the answers we provided, he urged us to extrapolate the need for countless
financial products.
Throughout the course, the trainers produced an overhead projection slide of
these life stages with irritating regularity. Woven in between factual
information about taxation, social security benefits and industry regulation
were references to this 'life line' and the all-important need to provide
for each stage with products from the financial services industry.
In many cases, though, the products they claimed were crucial would simply
be over-kill and, moreover, a waste of money. It is hard to believe, for
example, that a young person who is earning but still living at home needs
to consider a life assurance policy or critical illness cover. Yet, from
personal experience, I know that financial advisers try to target such
groups.
The trainers were careful to emphasise the requirement for advisers to
inform clients of product risks and poor surrender yields. They also
stressed constantly the importance of a 'fact find' to determine a client's
legitimate needs. But there was never any mention of the fact that some of
the industry's products - such as endowment policies - are now considered
inappropriate for most people.
By using the life line as a framework for determining client needs, the
course did not take into account many changes in society such as increased
periods of unemployment or multiple careers. These do not fit very soundly
with most of the products offered by insurance companies: namely, policies
that require regular premium payments over a long period. In many ways, the
training course simply seemed out of step with the times.
Nevertheless, the course was reassuring in that the company expected us to
be familiar with a broad range of topics. Preparation for the classroom
portion came in the form of a 400-page manual, which we were told to study
for at least 40 hours. In my case, it was more like 10.
At the end of the course, we took an examination modelled on the first paper
of the Chartered Insurance Institute's* financial planning certificate
(FPC1). At L&amp;G, the FPC1 is the first hurdle all trainees must overcome
before proceeding to instruction in specific products, sales skills and,
ultimately, selling itself.
'It is a relatively low-level qualification,' said Clive Sanderson,
divisional director of examinations at the CII. 'But, nevertheless, it is
very thorough in that it does introduce the regulatory situation and generic
products.'
I passed L&amp;G's mock exam by the narrowest margin. But it is slightly
worrying that I achieved this benchmark qualification without a great deal
of conscientious effort - especially since Dick Evemy, L&amp;G's training
manager, said that 'a majority' of recruits who walk through the doors of
the training centre pass it. It is even more worrying that independent
financial advisers - those who are not tied to a particular company - can
sell on the basis of FPC1 knowledge alone.
I would not want to give financial planning advice to anyone merely on the
basis of what I learned from the course. This is not an adequate foundation
for giving professional advice (although there is slight relief in knowing
that Lautro requires all company representatives to have more training
before being allowed to approach customers).
What I do believe, however, is that it is the only adequate basis for
receiving professional financial advice. Without it, or some equivalent, I
could easily feel that I was being blinded by jargon or concepts I did not
understand.
The CII produces course material for its FPC exams, and although they are
marketed widely to industry sales agents, any member of the public is
welcome to buy a study pack for Pounds 40. It could be the best financial
investment you make.
Regulators who are concerned about investor protection should not only be
concerned with proper training of the industry's sales force. They should
also put more effort into informing the consumer.
Perhaps the new Personal Investment Authority could sponsor a course for
customers called 'Let the Buyer Beware'.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Savings rates up at last
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BAYLISS, Moneyfacts
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-awaited rise in variable savings rates, following the increase in
base rates on September 12, has only now started to come through. That from
the Halifax, which took effect from October 21,was 0.35 of a percentage
point on most accounts.
Compared with the rest of the industry, this seems fair. Bearing in mind,
however, the millions of pounds the Halifax must have saved by its delay, it
would have been hoped that the rise could have matched the increase the
society made to its borrowers' rate (0.46 of a point).
Alliance &amp; Leicester, Britannia and Leeds are the major movers this week,
but their increases have not been across the board and vary from tier to
tier. At least these societies have moved. Many have yet to react, taking
the view that, if the money is still coming in, there is no need to raise
rates. Credit must be given to Barclays, which increased rates to savers by
the full half percentage point on September 12.
All savers need to keep a wary eye on their investment products. Even where
new rates have been announced, some tiers have risen by only 0.05 of a point
and savers could do better elsewhere.
Fixed-rate products that were quick to go up after the base rate increase
are also beginning to fall, or be withdrawn, as rumours of another base rate
rise subside.
Halifax has reduced rates on its Guaranteed Reserve account by half a
percentage point in recent weeks, and market-leading rates from Cheshire and
Skipton have been withdrawn. Guaranteed income bonds are also on the slide:
the best is down again to 8 per cent net (10.66 per cent gross).

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The end of unit trusts? -
Share-issuing Oeics could take over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oeics - pronounced the way a pig might - are an unfamiliar sound to the ears
of most unit trust investors but that is set to change. If all goes well,
fund management groups will be able to market Oeics, or open-ended
investment companies, from next summer.
These are described widely as a 'modern' type of unit trust - the type
unshackled by ancient trust law which has been a barrier to marketing unit
trusts to the rest of Europe. But since Oeics have been years in the making,
many fund management groups have hopped offshore to establish their
marketing gateway to Europe from more congenial regulatory environments such
as the Channel Islands, Luxembourg and Dublin.
Having done this, they may choose to remain where they are. And because
Oeics will have a different pricing structure from existing unit trusts, it
could be - initially, at least - that their impact will be greater at home
than abroad by forcing changes on the structure of existing unit trusts.
Final details on the structure of Oeics are yet to be honed but they will
differ from unit trusts in two significant ways. They will issue shares
instead of units and they will have a single pricing structure instead of
the present dual system.
Single pricing
At the moment, investors buy units at the 'offer' price and sell at the
lower 'bid' price. The difference between the two, known as the bid-offer
spread, is often in the range of 7-8 per cent although it can be much
higher.
Unit trusts have a dual pricing system because their underlying assets - the
stocks and shares which the fund manager buys - also operate on two
different prices. But the spread on a unit trust is much wider than that on
stocks and shares because it includes the initial charge - the manager's
sales levy, which is usually between 5 and 6 per cent - as well as stamp
duty and brokerage.
Under single pricing, an investor would pay the same figure no matter
whether he wanted to buy or sell units - probably, mid-way between the bid
and offer prices. Stamp duty would be payable on top and the manager would
quote the initial charge separately. The annual management fee would, as at
present, be stated separately.
Yet, Jeremy Burchill, compliance officer at M&amp;G, the largest unit trust
group, is concerned about the viability of the modern and the old living
side by side. 'Since Oeics will have single pricing and will be sold to
private investors, I think it is undesirable for the two different types of
pricing to exist,' he says.
Many in the industry expect single pricing for Oeics to result in single
pricing for unit trusts as well. Some even believe that Oeics represent the
demise of the unit trust. One said: 'In a few years, we will be wondering
what a unit trust was.'
Further steps are being taken along the path to deregulation. From Tuesday,
newspapers - including the Financial Times - will not be publishing the
'cancellation' price, the lowest level at which a company will buy back
units from an investor. This is used mostly by institutions which buy and
sell units in far greater numbers than private individuals.
More importantly, unit trusts will be able to impose exit charges on their
funds. Because of a quirk in the rules they have, until now, been able to do
this only on unit trusts sold within a personal equity plan.
This flexibility has been used most effectively by M&amp;G in the marketing of
its Managed Income Pep, which attracted around Pounds 500m within six months
of its launch in January.
With this Pep, M&amp;G eliminated altogether the initial charge but introduced
five-year withdrawal charges instead.
Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trust and
Investment Funds, says: 'We are likely to see more price competition as
companies take advantage of greater pricing liberalisation.'
This should be good news for private investors, but it also means they
should be careful not to be swayed by the pricing structure on a fund but to
choose a trust - or, indeed, an Oeic - based on their needs and the
management company's performance record.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: More power to the people - The
Pounds 186m payout to shareholders by East Midlands Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in East Midlands Electricity will be celebrating Christmas
early this year, and other electricity company shareholders could be joining
them. On Monday, East Midlands announced a special interim dividend of
Pounds 186m, or 85p a share. Since the average shareholder owns 200, this
will produce a cheque for Pounds 170 some time towards the end of November.
Like the share buy-backs that other utilities have announced in recent
weeks, East Midlands' sudden generosity was prompted partly by the
embarrassingly large amount of cash it has accumulated since privatisation
and partly by a fear that Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
might try to get his hands on it when he brings down the Budget next month.
For a number of reasons, East Midlands thought the special dividend was a
better way of getting this cash to shareholders than buying in shares.
According to chairman Nigel Rudd, it is fairer: all the shareholders get the
cash, rather than just those who are lucky enough to be at the top of the
buy-back queue.
It is also better for East Midlands' staff who are saving up to exercise
options on shares at a set price: it gives them a bigger profit when they
exercise the options.
The third reason is that there is greater tax certainty: the Inland Revenue
has said that the dividend will be treated like any other, and those who
qualify for a tax credit will get it. In the case of a share buy-back,
decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.
The dividend was only half the story, though. East Midlands also announced
it was consolidating its shares on a 22-for-25 basis. This will offset the
value by which they might be expected to fall to reflect the amount of cash
being taken out of the company. So, at the end of the day, the share price
should remain the same. (At the moment they are ex-special dividend and
trading well below their earlier price. This will remain the case until
November 24 when shareholders are due to approve the transaction).
In the long run, though, Rudd says earnings per share should benefit because
the company has become more-highly geared because of the pay-out, and its
assets will be working harder.
Analysts generally welcomed the pay-out and cast around for other possible
candidates. The obvious ones are Yorkshire Electricity and Southern
Electric, the only two regional electricity companies which have not, so
far, passed surplus cash back to their shareholders.
Another possible is Eastern, which did its buy-back before the industry
regulator introduced new price formulas in August which enabled companies to
work out how much surplus cash they would have.
The cash hand-outs may have got the stock market excited but they were not
popular politically. East Midlands' move brought angry protests from
consumer groups which thought the money should go to customers rather than
shareholders.
Labour's trade and industry spokesman, Jack Cunningham, also called for an
inquiry into 'profiteering' and said: 'East Midlands' consumers have been
forced to pay 20 per cent more for their electricity since privatisation.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Tax-free - for now
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An investment offering unlimited tax-free capital gains from UK shares might
sound too good to be true. But a new issue from Fidelity promises investors
precisely that.
The equity index-linked loan stock attached to the new Fidelity Special
Values investment trust is a low-cost instrument, with a capital value that
will mirror exactly the ups and downs of the FT-SE-A All-Share index. Any
capital gains are not taxable.
The loan stock makes use of tax legislation which treats bonds issued by
companies in the same way as government gilts, which are exempt from capital
gains tax. The downside is that losses cannot be offset against gains
elsewhere.
Still, even index-linked gilts only keep pace with the retail price index,
not with share prices which, over time, have tended to rise faster than
inflation (although, of course, there is no guarantee of this). If, at the
end of the Fidelity stock's 10-year life, the All-Share index has fallen
below its present level, investors will get back less than they paid.
The stock will also pay interest twice a year, set to reflect the yield on
the All-Share index - now about 4 per cent. This income is taxable.
About half a dozen investment trusts have issued equity index-linked loan
stock, but Fidelity appears to be the first group to achieve this tax-exempt
status. Loan stock issued by Fidelity European Values in 1991 and in January
this year also has the same tax status.
Stocks issued by other trusts have not met the exact criteria to be defined
as both qualifying indexed securities and qualifying corporate bonds.
Stock issued by Scottish American investment trust, for example, is
classified as a deep-gain security; this means gains are taxed as income,
making it unattractive to private investors. Broadgate's loan stock is
classified as a qualifying indexed security, but does not have qualifying
corporate bond status. This means investors' gains are taxed like equity
gains: you can use your capital gains tax allowance and indexation, and
losses are allowable against other capital gains.
The position of the two issues of index-linked loan stock by Ivory &amp; Sime
trusts - British Assets and Selective Assets - has not yet been clarified.
Yet, even the issues which are liable for capital gains tax can be
attractive to private investors (particularly smaller investors who do not
use up their annual capital gains tax allowance) as they are
straightforward, index-tracking instruments and are lower cost than
index-tracker unit trusts, which charge an annual management fee.
The new Fidelity issue is also the first to be accessible easily to private
investors; previously, most issues of index-linked loan stock have been
snapped up by large institutions which manage index-tracker funds. The
minimum purchase of Fidelity's loan stock is Pounds 5,000.
If there is strong demand for this issue, other fund managers are likely to
come up with similar products - but an expanding market could attract less
welcome attention. 'It is a loophole, whichever way you look at it,' said
one industry insider. The worry is that such loopholes tend to be closed
smartly by the Inland Revenue.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors are wary - New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What price new issues? Despite FT research, published in Thursday's paper,
showing an adequate return from a majority of this year's stock market
debutants, adverse publicity about a small but significant number of new
issues has affected investor sentiment to other flotations.
TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group, this week became the
latest group to unveil a lower valuation on its shares than previously
foreseen. TLG's valuation of Pounds 205m is more than Pounds 20m below its
expectations just two weeks ago when the pathfinder prospectus was issued.
'They tried to come to the market at 125p a share - 10p higher than the
actual price - but the institutions wouldn't wear it,' said one analyst.
Yet, the FT research - which covered 85 issues between the start of January
and the end of September, excluding investment trusts, investment companies,
demergers and non-UK businesses - showed new issues outperforming the
FT-SE-A All-Share index by 0.8 per cent. Even where new issues
underperformed the market, they often scored better against their sector
indices.
The survey also indicated that the worst-performing stocks were priced
between the back end of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994, a period when
the stock market was riding high and optimism over the scope of the recovery
helped to fuel expectations.
Low interest rates and investor demand for smaller companies geared to the
recovery led many private companies to consider an earlier flotation.
The result was a flood of new issues which ranged widely in quality and were
priced for the most optimistic potential.
'There's no doubt that healthy cynicism has returned again,' says Andrew
Parry, head of UK equities at fund manager Baring Securities. 'The prices
being put on new issues are realistic.'
This view was echoed by several other fund managers - indicating that many
new entrants desiring at least a market rating will now have to earn it.
As if to prove the point, dealing began this week in Filtronic Comtek, which
also saw its valuation expectations reduced when its shares were priced
recently. They are being traded at a 15 per cent premium to their issue
price.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family (The Pensions Scandal): Mugged by
salesmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Sutoris, a former teacher who now works in local government, got a
multiple mugging from personal pension salesmen. The National Union of
Teachers (NUT) has issued a High Court writ against the life companies
involved.
The teachers' scheme is one of the best in the country in terms of
guaranteed benefits and annual pension increases. For those who move within
the public sector and local government, it is possible to transfer the full
value of benefits.
Yet, Sutoris was advised in November 1987 to leave and start a retirement
annuity contract  - the forerunner to personal pensions  - which took effect
from early 1988. Later that year, he was advised to transfer his seven
years' benefits out of the teachers' scheme to a personal plan.
'No mention was made of the guaranteed indexed pension I was giving up and
the investment risks associated with personal pensions,' he said. 'I didn't
realise I would lose out on the transfer  - if I had known, I would not have
gone ahead.'
On the salesman's advice, he opted out of the state earnings-related pension
scheme (Serps), and his rebates of National Insurance contributions were
channelled into a separate personal plan.
Later, he was sold three more personal pensions to increase his regular
premium policy in line with his salary increases.
The NUT has a heavy caseload of similar cases. Debbie Smith, who works in
the legal department at the union's headquarters, said: 'We have up to 100
complex cases like Mike's and our 10 regional offices have a similar
case-load. Over 50 different life offices are involved.'
Time is running short for some victims but the NUT has taken steps to
protect these members. Smith explained: 'Where one of our members was sold a
personal pension in 1988, we have issued High Court writs to protect them
against the six-year breach of contract time limit.'
Several other unions, including the GMB, the miners and the nurses, are
co-ordinating cases. If you have not yet done anything about your transfer,
ask your union if it will help.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family (The Pensions Scandal): How losers
will be compensated - The ways you can now get redress if you switched
wrongly to a personal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board  - chief regulator of the financial
services industry in the UK  - told insurance companies and financial
advisers this week how to compensate thousands of people who incurred
financial loss when they gave up company pension scheme benefits in favour
of a personal pension plan. SIB identified three groups which may qualify
for compensation:
Pension transfers  - people who transferred company pension benefits to a
personal pension plan.
Opt-outs  - employees who left a company scheme to take out a personal plan.
Non-joiners  - employees who did not join a company scheme because they were
sold a personal plan.
Each group is divided into priority and non-priority cases. If yours is a
priority case, it will be reviewed automatically within two years by the
organisation responsible for the sale. If poor advice is proved, the
organisation must follow SIB's rules on calculating and paying compensation.
The provider or adviser must set out compensation details in a 'letter of
redress'. Under SIB's guidelines, you could be reinstated in your former
company scheme or receive a top-up to your personal plan. Either way, the
compensation should return you to a position equivalent to the one in which
you were before you took out the personal plan.
SIB has legal power under the Financial Services Act 1986 to enforce its
rules and will monitor the system closely. But your case will not be
considered for compensation if:
1. You were self-employed when you took out a personal plan.
2. Your employer did not have an occupational scheme.
3. You were advised to transfer, opt out or not join before April 29 1988
when the Financial Services Act began.
4. Your complaint relates solely to investment performance.
If you are not on the priority list but think you have a justified
complaint, you should write to the organisation that sold you the personal
pension, setting out the relevant details. Where individuals complain, SIB
has asked organisations to review the case within two years of the request.
The whole process  - from identifying those who have lost out, to paying
compensation  - is complex and time-consuming. The following guide, together
with the diagram showing priority cases, could help you through the maze.
PENSION TRANSFERS
Total number of cases: 600,000.
Priority cases: 100,000.
Number expected to receive compensation*: 20,000.
Average compensation per case*: Pounds 2,500.
Priority cases: These are split into two groups of older employees, since
these face the most immediate difficulties in the run-up to retirement. The
first group includes men over 55 and women over 50 at the time of transfer;
those who have retired already; and the spouses and dependants of people who
have died. These cases will be reviewed automatically by December 31 1995.
The second group includes men between 50 and 54 and women between 45 and 49
at the time of transfer. These cases will be reviewed automatically by
December 31 1996.
Comment: The number of priority cases is small compared with the total and,
of these, very few are expected to be compensated. Mitchell Philpott,
director of independent adviser Lexis Pensions Consultants, says: 'For many
of these cases, actuarial calculations will show that prospective loss has
not occurred.'
James Higgins, managing director of independent adviser Chamberlain de Broe,
adds: 'Unfortunately, with the way personal pensions are sold, the client
believes the transfer represents a simple choice between two similar pension
arrangements. He probably did not understand what guarantees were given up,
yet might well have signed a statement saying he did.'
PENSION OPT-OUTS
Total cases: 450,000.
Priority cases*: 150,000.
Number expected to receive compensation: 250,000-300,000.
Average compensation per case*: Pounds 10,000.
NON-JOINERS
Total cases: 1m.
Priority cases: 60,000.
Priority cases: SIB assessed the opt-outs and non-joiners together in three
priority groups. The first includes (a) people who are retired, and the
spouses or dependants of those who have died, plus (b) people who left an
employer's scheme, were 35 or over at the time they took out the personal
plan, and who are still with the same employer. These cases should be
reviewed by December 31 1995.
Group 2 includes non-joiners over 35 when they took out a personal plan who
are still with the same employer, plus those who were under 35 when they
left the employer's scheme and who are still with the same employer.
The latter group must be paying contributions in addition to the National
Insurance rebate paid to employees' personal plans where they opt out of the
state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). These cases should be
reviewed by June 30 1996.
Group 3 includes people who were over 35 when they left an employer's scheme
and took out a personal pension (both rebate-only and where extra
contributions are paid) and who are no longer with the same employer. These
cases must be reviewed by December 31 1996.
Where more information is required on the employees' pension options at the
time of the sale, SIB asked providers to send questionnaires to priority
cases. These will go out early next year.
Comment: Most people who were advised to opt out of a company scheme for a
personal pension in theory should receive compensation because personal
pension benefits do not match up to those offered by most schemes. But
Philpott warns: 'The logistics of identifying opt-outs is enormous and
non-response will reduce significantly the numbers compensated.'
Moreover, the priority category includes only those who are still with the
same employer. If you changed jobs since taking out the personal plan  - and
an estimated 60 per cent have done so  - then you are a non-priority case.
Non-joiners represent the most difficult category to assess and experts
believe few will be compensated.
Sources of help. For advice, telephone the Personal Investments Authority
(PIA) pensions unit on 071-417 7001; fax: 417 8100.
If you disagree with your review, you can complain to the relevant ombudsman
or arbitration scheme. The provider or adviser should explain the
appropriate complaints procedure in the redress letter.
To get SIB's fact sheet, The Pension Transfer and Opt-Out Review, send a
large SAE to Pensions Fact Sheet, PO Box 701, Basildon, Essex SS14 3FD.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazard Investors this week abandoned its planned launch of an investment
trust specialising in regional brewers. The offer for Lazard Brewers
Investment Trust failed to attract the minimum Pounds 50m the fund managers
had hoped for. The collapse was blamed on poor market conditions, rather
than the concept behind the fund. The trust had agreed to buy a Pounds 27m
portfolio of shares in regional brewers from brewing giant Whitbread, but
this deal has been cancelled.

Wall Street had been expecting it for some time, but when the yield on the

prices have been falling - and correspondingly, yields rising - since late
last year.

Unit trust sales for the third quarter are down to Pounds 1.88bn from Pounds
2.81bn the previous quarter. The third quarter is traditionally one of the
weakest for sales but in the corresponding period last year net sales
totalled Pounds 2.61bn. Monthly figures also fell. In September they were a
net Pounds 470.7m, the second lowest figure this year, down from August's
net sales of Pounds 767.1m.
However, net sales of unit trusts for the year are still higher at Pounds
7.15bn than for the same period last year when they amounted to Pounds
6.95bn. Last year the unit trust industry attracted a record Pounds 9.14bn
of net investment.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Fiasco over pensions casts long shadow - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Never mind the sleaze allegations that have engulfed Westminster: the
scandal which gave the City much greater pause for thought this week was the
extent of the pensions fiasco.
It was always expected that the report of the Securities and Investments
Board into the mis-selling of personal pension would make unhappy reading
for the personal finance industry. However, it still came as unpleasant news
to learn the scale of poor advice was far greater than had been thought -
and that the compensation bill could reach Pounds 2bn.
Life insurers must review hundreds of thousands of personal pensions and
compensate those investors who were wrongly advised to buy them. Since 1988,
some 600,000 personal pensions have been sold to people transferring lump
sums from occupational schemes. Separately, a survey by the SIB's actuaries
estimated that in more than 850,000 cases, people were advised to opt out of
employers' schemes or not to join.
The shares of the quoted insurance companies held up fairly well, because
they have already made substantial provision for potential compensation.
However, Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer, gave an
inkling of the damage to investors' confidence when it revealed that sales
of single-premium individual pensions in the first nine months of the year
had fallen by 30 per cent.
Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, did nothing to alleviate
these gloomy thoughts when he warned a conference of personnel managers that
Britain's financial services industry was facing an upheaval on the scale
that had previously been experienced by manufacturing. Sir Brian said that
although about 160,000 jobs had already been lost in financial services in
the past five years, the competitive environment was going to get tougher
still.
For most of the week, there was little offsetting cheer from the stock
market, which continues to be in thrall to fluctuating sentiment in the bond
and currency markets. The FT-SE 100 went down 28 points on Tuesday, up 30
points on Thursday, and scarcely moved on Monday and Thursday. Even
yesterday's 54-point gain mainly reflected relief that the US third-quarter
growth figures had been well received in the bond markets, and was achieved
in thin turnover.
Volatility in the stock market is being increased by the low level of
trading in London, which the chart illustrates. Edmond Warner, an analyst
with Kleinwort Benson, points out that equity bargains currently number
about 25,000 a day, almost 10,000 below the average of the past two years.
Over this period activity was only as thin in the Christmas season and in
early July this year - just after the market hit its 1994 low.
Warner says: 'Meagre turnover is not in itself negative - apart perhaps for
stockbrokers' sanity - but does reflect the prevailing uncertainty in the
market. However, it also indicates the growing risk that equity prices will
shift dramatically. Either current nervousness will transfer into outright
institutional selling, or market makers will find their trading books
unprepared for a resurgence of buying interest.'
The Confederation of British Industry's latest quarterly survey of
industrial trends showed on Tuesday that UK manufacturers were enjoying an
export boom, but were also planning to increase prices in the face of rising
costs. The survey said more manufacturers were planning to increase domestic
prices over the next four months than at any time since January, 1991.
The survey said that the pattern of price rises was mixed, with some
industries still reporting declines. It added that manufacturers'
expectations for higher prices did not always translate into reality.
The CBI survey's findings on price expectations were one of the factors
cited by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, the governor of
the Bank of England, when they increased base rates last month.
However, on Thursday George said financial markets, both in the UK and
overseas, were exaggerating the inflationary threat, and the likely interest
rate rises needed to combat it. Analysts surmised that the Bank's quarterly
inflation report, to be released on Tuesday next week, was unlikely to
contain any surprises about inflation pressures in the economy.
Meanwhile, shares in the electricity sector rose after East Midlands
Electricity said it would give Pounds 186m back to its shareholders in a
special interim dividend payment. The pay-out brings to nearly Pounds 1bn
the amount returned to shareholders by privatised electricity companies this
year.
Imperial Chemical Industries confirmed that the chemicals industry was
recovering strongly with third-quarter figures that showed operating profits
more than doubling in some divisions. But it warned that while prices for
many of its goods were rising, those nearer the consumer - such as paints -
remained very competitive.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said demand in most markets looked 'more
promising than for some time. Activity in the US, UK and Australian markets
remains generally firm. Recovery in continental Europe appears to be under
way and even the Japanese economy seems to have bottomed. Robust growth in
the rest of the Far East continues.'
One domestic factor which encouraged yesterday's surge by the FT-SE 100 was
GEC's decision to top British Aerospace's agreed bid for VSEL, the
Barrow-based submarine maker.
This may or may not be the start of the final showdown between GEC and BAe
over which group will dominate the rump of the British defence industry. But
watching a contested takeover makes a pleasant break for traders from
fretting about the global bonds market.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Stop worrying and love the boom - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy keeps moving along at an impressive clip, but Wall Street
remains as unsure as ever in the face of the economic recovery and does not
know whether to love it or loathe it.
This week, the markets passed the first four days in an uneasy limbo, with
traders and investors spending too much of their time worrying about what
Friday's third quarter gross domestic product report would say about the
pace of economic growth, and what it would mean for monetary policy and
interest rates, and not enough time concentrating on the positive
fundamentals underpinning share prices - such as robust corporate earnings.
When the GDP report came out just before the markets opened yesterday, the
news seemed bad. Bad, that is, to anyone worried about excessive economic
growth. According to the Commerce department, GDP rose 3.4 per cent in the
third quarter, a slowdown from the 4.1 per cent growth rate of the second
quarter, but still considerably stronger than Wall Street had been
expecting. Forecasts had ranged from GDP growth of 2.8 per cent to 3.0 per
cent.
The fact that the economy was growing faster than anticipated triggered some
early selling of bonds, on the assumption that the data only increased the
chances that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates when its
policy-making committee next gathered in mid-November. Although share prices
did not fall on the news, they did not rise either, and no one in the stock
market was particularly enthralled at the prospect of yet more rate
increases.
Consistency, however, has never been one of the markets' stronger points.
Within half an hour of the opening bell yesterday, sentiment appeared to
have turned round completely. Bonds began rallying, in the process sending
the yield on the benchmark 30-year back below 8 per cent. (On Monday, the
30-year yield closed above 8 per cent for the first time in two and a half
years, triggering an avalanche of feverish commentary heralding the end of
the world as everyone knew it.) Stocks took off on an even more improbable
flight. By 11am, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 40
points.
The roots of this remarkable comeback were hidden in the text of the third
quarter GDP report. Although the headline figure of 3.4 per cent growth was
disturbing, bond traders and analysts liked what they saw elsewhere in the
data. The implicit price deflator, a closely-watched inflation indicator,
rose by only 1.6 per cent in the quarter, down from 2.9 per cent in the
previous period. Another inflation measure, the fixed weight index, rose 2.7
per cent, which was also considerably less than expected.
Then there was the data on inventories, which showed that companies rushed
to stock their shelves in the third quarter to meet unexpectedly strong
consumer demand. Analysts said the subsequent big jump in inventories - the
largest since 1984 - should be offset in the fourth quarter when businesses,
their warehouses likely overflowing with stock, place fewer orders for
manufactured goods.
There were other, less compelling, statistics in the third quarter GDP
release which also reassured the markets that the economy was not quite as
buoyant as it seemed, but the clear message from the markets was that
overall, the report was nothing like as unwelcome as it first seemed.
That did not mean, however, that everyone could stop worrying about another
imminent Fed rate increase (following the markets these days requires a mind
as agile as a gazelle). No, there was nothing in the GDP data to suggest the
Fed will not decide to tighten policy again at its open market committee
meeting on November 15. But there were enough encouraging nuggets of
information in the figures to suggest that the next Fed rate rise may be the
last for some time.
The Fed would like to see the economic growth rate reduced to a less
potentially inflationary 2.5 per cent. Assuming that the Fed puts up the
federal rounds rate next month by another half a percentage point (this is
the consensus among analysts on Wall Streets), the central bank will have
raised short-term rates this year from below 3 per cent to 5.25 per cent.
Over the same period, long-term interest rates will have risen from 6.3 per
cent to about 8 per cent.
According to the optimists who bought stocks and bonds yesterday, these
increases should have tightened credit conditions sufficiently to slow the
economy over the next year to a growth rate with which the Fed feels
comfortable - say, 2.5 per cent. It is a neat scenario, too neat perhaps.
But it at least gives Wall Street some reason for optimism as it enters what
could be a long, cold winter.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: You'll pay - even if you weren't conned -
Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unsung victim of the latest great pensions scandal could be . . . you. Of
course, the worst hit are the hundreds and thousands of people who were
advised wrongly to buy personal pensions. But the bill for compensation -
estimated at up to Pounds 2bn - will be footed partly by other life
insurance and pension policyholders.
Here is how the chain works. Liability for recompense falls either on the
independent financial adviser or on the life insurance company if the sale
was made by a life company salesman or appointed rep. But where does the
life insurance company go for money?
For mutual companies, the only source is the life insurance fund, which is
wholly owned by holders of its life insurance and pension policies.
Companies with shareholders can go both to policyholders and to
shareholders. If they fund the compensation payments from the life fund,
roughly 90 per cent will normally come from policyholders and the other 10
per cent from shareholders - and they could also go direct to shareholders.
All the figures involved are so notional at the moment that there is no
point in trying to work out the impact of the compensation payments on
individual companies. There are around Pounds 300bn of life funds. So, even
if the whole of the compensation were the responsibility of the life
companies (very unrealistic), the compensation still would be less than 1
per cent of assets. Some companies may take a bigger hit.
What is more, the fresh cash drain comes at a time when life insurance
payouts on with-profit policies are falling and are likely to drop further.
Many industry experts reckon that far too many life insurance companies are
still paying out much more than can be justified by their investment returns
 -and running down their safety margins fast. So, policyholders will, yet
again, pay for the mistakes of insurance management - as they have already
over the disastrous forays into estate agency by some life companies.
The innocent winner in the personal pension scandal is British industry.
Company pension schemes have benefited from the improved solvency produced
by the opt-outs - people who were persuaded to leave a company scheme even
though they still worked at the company, or advised to buy a personal
pension rather than join the company scheme.
Meanwhile, the employers themselves have benefited both from this and from
the drop in the number of employees for whom they need to make
contributions. A large number of companies have enjoyed several years of
pension 'holidays' during which they have not needed to pay in to the
pension fund.
Opt-outs are not the main reason for the pension surpluses which allowed
companies to take these holidays, but they will have helped in some cases.
A less innocent winner is the government - which enjoys the same benefits as
any other employer. It is arguable that it is no more responsible for
ill-advised opt-outs than any other employer. But the next pension scandal
to break will be over the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps),
where the government actually bribed people to trade in part of their state
pension for a personal plan.
Now for a couple of books for the very serious stock market investor. Both
are potentially useful but both are hard work.
The first is for people who want to understand not just what company
accounts are trying to tell shareholders - but what they are trying to
conceal. Interpreting Company Reports and Accounts*, by Holmes and Sugden,
is in its fifth edition and remains the best way to learn about  - if not to
love - the subject.
The authors use real company examples, first to set out how all the items in
accounts work and then to explain how investment analysts use them. The
section on accounting loopholes is getting smaller, though. This is sad for
the reader, since it was the most fun, but the shrinkage reflects good news
for shareholders at large: the scope for financial sophistry is getting
smaller.
The other 'book' serves the investor who has a working knowledge of accounts
but prefers to let other people crunch most of his numbers, while he
concentrates on looking for that handful of shares worth buying. Publisher
Hemmington Scott has used its extensive data base to produce a company
handbook tailored to the requirements of former financier Jim Slater.
Company Refs** is a touch gimmicky but provides a diversity of investment
yardsticks for all the companies in the FT-SE-A All-Share index.
The main book is divided by company. The second slices companies by stock
market sector, investment classification, attributes such as yield, and even
the likelihood of companies being promoted to one of the main indexes such
as the FT-SE 100. The third explains how to use the system
Would anyone actually invest just on the basis of comparative analysis done
with the help of Company Refs? Probably not. An intelligent investor would
use it to get or confirm ideas - then send off for a set of company accounts
and sweat through the numbers himself with Holmes and Sugden. Not for the
faint-hearted.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Markets: Doom, gloom, record profits - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeremy Lancaster, who has turned Wolseley into the biggest supplier of
heating and plumbing equipment in the world, is frank about his pessimism.
'I'm just not an optimistic guy,' he said, after announcing yet another set
of record results on Tuesday.
However, after 20 odd years the City is beginning to catch on to his
downbeat manner. Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 came in at Pounds
202.3m, at the top end of analysts' expectations. This was 67 per cent up
from the previous year, when Wolseley surprised the City with profits of
Pounds 121.1m - well ahead of the top forecast of Pounds 115m.
The results are remarkable enough, given the recession. Even more remarkable
is the latest earnings per share figure of 50.77p, up from 33.60p for 1993
and 37 per cent ahead of the previous record EPS of 37p in 1990. The growth
has come from across the group's operations. 'There hasn't been a laggard
amongst them,' said Lancaster.
Leading the field last year was the US, where profits from building
distribution leapt from Pounds 47m to Pounds 86.8m on turnover up from
Pounds 1.21bn to Pounds 1.72bn. The first full contribution from Erb Lumber,
bought last September, was Pounds 13.5m.
Erb and Carolina Builders, both timber distributors, have been 'on a roll
for two years', with 30 per cent annual sales growth. But sales in the US
plumbing distribution operations also improved strongly, with Ferguson
Enterprises 22 per cent ahead, Familian Northwest 20 per cent, and Familian
in California ahead by more than 3 per cent and back in the black.
'We have a reputation for being extreme pessimists which I'm happy with  -
but even we do not think the US will be too bad next year,' Lancaster said,
adding that the rate of growth was likely to slow down.
The improvement in European building distribution was not quite so dramatic,
with profits rising from Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 81m on sales up from Pounds
1bn to Pounds 1.14bn. Of special interest was Brossette, which managed to
maintain margins and lift sales by more than 5 per cent in a difficult
French market.
The successful export of the Wolseley formula to France bodes well for OAG,
the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in Austria bought last April
for Pounds 56.9m.
Wolseley sounded warning on the UK, although the results were good,
especially since two-thirds of sales go into the still-depressed repair and
maintenance market. The British recovery was fragile, and it was impossible
to predict the housing market.
Margins in the US and UK are near their peaks, however, which puts the onus
on increasing volumes and better results from the manufacturing side.
Manufacturing sales were ahead just 3 per cent at Pounds 390.3m, yielding
profits of Pounds 36.6m, up 11 per cent.
The group believes expansion is possible in all markets. It went to the US
in 1982 because it was worried about the prospects for expansion in the UK.
At the time it had 300 UK outlets, which have grown to 444; US outlets have
risen from 52 to 416.
The balance sheet is strong, with gearing of just over 10 per cent, so
further acquisitions are likely. In June the group paid Pounds 28m for
Calumet Holdings of Chicago, a deal which it believes has made it the
world's leading distributor of professional photographic equipment. Calumet
is strong in mail order, an expertise Wolseley would like to transfer to
other parts of the group.
The City is looking for further growth, with profits forecast at Pounds 240m
and earnings at around 58p. The shares, which closed at 752p last Friday,
fell to 725p after the results were announced on Tuesday, partly because the
figures did not top the forecasts. By the close yesterday they had more than
recovered the losses.
The question of succession remains. Richard Ireland, finance director,
retires next month and will be replaced by Steve Webster, who joined as
deputy finance director in summer. Lancaster, 58, is widely expected to
retire in two years. Perhaps that is why he was so keen on Tuesday to play
down the importance of individuals to the group's performance, and why most
of the board attended the results meetings.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Long View: When prudence vanishes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pensions business is a natural breeding ground for swindles. You pay
your money now but do not find out what benefits you are getting until many
years hence. Meanwhile, the information you receive is, at best, actuarial
gobbledegook. If you are really out of luck, your trustee turns out to be
Robert Maxwell.
The particular financial scandal in the headlines this week has concerned
the mis-selling of personal pensions after they became available to
employees (rather than the self-employed) in 1988. The government and its
regulatory watchdog, the Securities and Investments Board, turned a blind
eye when armies of salesmen fanned out across the country. Up to the
present, around 8m personal pension plans have been sold to employees.
Now, SIB's penny has dropped. It has discovered that some of these people
were misled by commission-hungry intermediaries and has outlined its plans
for redress. About 350,000 priority cases will be re-examined and another
1m-odd could be affected.
Unfortunately, there has never been an inquiry into a comparable pensions
disaster of the early 1980s. In the recession, many British companies
declared hundreds of thousands of long-serving employees to be redundant and
fobbed them off with frozen deferred pensions. The already-inadequate real
value of these has now halved.
It is asking for trouble to allow provision of pensions to be controlled by
economic agents - employers, life companies, sometimes even governments -
which do not have the interests of the beneficiaries primarily in mind.
Company schemes were designed to achieve corporate objectives - basically,
to reward long service and promotion - but companies had little regard for
employees once they had left. It required legislation to improve matters;
meanwhile, occupational schemes got a bad name, especially among the young
and mobile. That gave the personal pensions' salesmen an opening -
encouraged by the government, which itself was motivated primarily by a
desire to reduce the cost of the state earnings-related scheme (Serps).
As for the life companies, by the late 1980s the most successful of them had
become dominated by their sales forces. Their ethos was that they were
selling unquestionably desirable products in life assurance, savings and
pensions. You could not have too much of these good things.
So, the increasingly high-pressure sales methods, and rising commission
rates, were considered to be means justified by ends. Disclosure of
commissions and other costs at the point of sale, which might have disrupted
this sales drive, was resisted successfully for many years; its imminent
introduction, in January, is throwing the life industry into turmoil.
In selling the new-style personal pensions to employees, however, life
companies were not just marketing products - inevitably, they were offering
advice. Customers could stay put in their company scheme (by then, with
better protection for early leavers) or in Serps or, alternatively, they
could opt for a personal plan. But you cannot reward advisers satisfactorily
by paying them commission on product sales. Biased advice is sure to result.
What was SIB doing at the time? It was re-writing its rule-book and devising
its core principles, or '10 commandments'. These say firms must observe
'high standards of integrity and fair dealing' and that the customer should
be given 'any information needed to enable him to make a balanced and
informed decision'. Meanwhile, the government was delighted at the success
of its personal pensions' promotion.
To a degree, things have improved. The regulators have come down from the
ethical stratosphere. They have fined many of the erring life offices. Two
of the subsidiary regulatory bodies have been merged to form the new
Personal Investment Authority, which is supposed to apply more consistent
controls. At the same time, you would have to be irrepressibly optimistic to
believe similar problems could not recur.
The combination of aggressive marketing by myriad investment firms, and
bureaucratic investor protection, is prone to huge blind spots. These happen
when particular market trends (such as the 1980s' house price boom, which
produced the home income plans' scandal) or fashions of political
correctness (such as personal pensions) override normal prudence and
judgment.
Bailing people out of trouble is all very well, but it brings a clear risk
of moral hazard: that small investors will come to believe they will be
compensated if anything goes seriously wrong and, consequently, they will be
drawn more readily into risky and unfamiliar products. The responsibility of
clients, as opposed to salesmen, is ill-defined.
As it unpicks the personal pensions' tangle, SIB should think laterally and
wonder why there is so much investment risk in British savings products. Why
are investment companies not falling over themselves to offer low-risk
products based upon the remarkable 9 per cent gilt-edged yields now
available? Instead, there is a plethora of complex guaranteed and
high-income products based upon futures contracts.
The answer, as with personal pensions, is that high commissions are
distorting advice. Interestingly, the left-of-centre Committee on Social
Justice this week suggested a National Savings Pension Plan - which would
offer very low-cost, index-linked gilt funds and index-tracking equity funds
 -to set a cost benchmark for the competition. The puzzle is why such funds
do not exist already or, where they do, have so little impact. The
explanation is that it does not pay intermediaries to recommend them.
There is a fine line indeed between regulating the market and interfering
with it. Here is a motto for SIB: a little bit of the latter might remove
the need for a lot of the former.

FT  29 OCT 94 / A better class of corruption: Britain has a notable record
of sleaze A century of hypocrisy in high places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This country has an international reputation for the integrity and honour of
its public institutions.
 - John Major in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
Britain, whose government has been seen as pristine in a murky world for the
best part of a century and a half, has three senior ministers up to their
eyes in sleaze.
The chancellor of the exchequer, the attorney general and the government
chief whip have been trading in the shares of a US group with cross-holdings
in a British company which has just gained a huge government
telecommunications contract. They bought the shares at a discount, courtesy
of the attorney general's brother; a third brother is manager of the British
company. The chief whip has also invested party funds in the shares.
That was the position in October 1912, when the House of Commons first
debated the Marconi scandal. David Lloyd George and his colleagues covered
their traces with disingenuous speeches, but prime minister Asquith felt
obliged to set up a select committee investigation.
The truth only started to emerge after revelations in the French press. Yet
the majority report of the government-dominated committee exonerated the
ministers, and a party vote on the floor of the Commons did the same.
Asquith not only failed to call for any resignations: within months he had
appointed Rufus Isaacs, the Attorney General, as Lord Chief Justice.
Lloyd George ousted Asquith in the depths of the first world war. During his
six years in Downing Street, he turned trafficking of honours into an art
form, leaving office with a personal fund estimated at Pounds 1.5m - Pounds
40m in today's money.
Contrary to popular myth, Lloyd George was not the only prime ministerial
honours salesman. The saintly Gladstone substantially cleaned up British
politics in the 1870s and 1880s, introducing the secret ballot and laws
limiting local electoral spending and curbing corrupt electoral practices.
But Gladstone continued to sell honours to fill the Liberal war chest.
After him the late-Victorian and Edwardian Tory governments of Lord
Salisbury and Arthur Balfour dished out peerages, baronetcies and
knighthoods at an unprecedented rate in return for contributions to party
funds. Salisbury treated the process with patrician disdain: 'No more
tobacconists I entreat you,' he wrote to his colleague the Duke of
Devonshire after a dodgy baronetcy raised eyebrows.
The trafficking was hidden from public view. As Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky
of Brunel University, an expert on party corruption, puts it: 'Over the past
century British politics has been far from sleaze free: but compared to
other countries the British are adept at dealing with corruption quietly.'
The comparison with France is instructive. In the 1880s and 1890s the French
political establishment was shaken by a succession of public corruption
scandals, including the Wilson affair which involved president Grevy's
son-in-law selling the Legion of Honour from the Elysee Palace. In Britain
such scandals rarely reached the press; still more rarely were they taken up
by opposition parties, who were themselves part of the honours trade. Even
Maundy Gregory - the celebrated honours tout, who operated a network of
agents for both the Liberals and Tories - was spirited abroad to France, at
the expense of Tory donors, when official investigations started to close
in.
Lloyd George's crime in the eyes of the Establishment was that his excesses
brought the system into public disrepute and embarrassed King George V. The
scandal started to boil when a convicted wartime food hoarder received a
baronetcy, and became uncontainable after a peerage was offered to a South
African diamond merchant who had been convicted for serious fraud.
Greater discretion reigned after Lloyd George's resignation, but the sleaze
continued. In the late 1920s Warden Chilcott, one of Gregory's associates,
persuaded several Indian princes to part with Pounds 100,000 (nearly Pounds
3m today) for a fund to promote their interests in London, believing that
the India Secretary, the flamboyant FE Smith (Lord Birkenhead), was in
Chilcott's pocket.
Even those determined to cleanse the Augean stables were dragged in. In
1934, the socialist Ramsay MacDonald, prime minister of a mainly Tory
government, was forced to give a baronetcy to Julien Cahn, who had paid
Pounds 30,000 to finance Gregory's overseas sojourn. Stanley Baldwin, the
Tory leader, warned MacDonald that all three parties were implicated -
including three past or future Tory leaders (Churchill, Bonar Law and Sir
Austen Chamberlain) - and that otherwise Gregory would 'stir up such a
filthy sewer as would poison public life'.
Not a word reached press or Parliament. France again offers a parallel. In
1934 the Stavisky affair - prompted by the suicide of a shady financier,
whose affairs the government tried to hush up to protect ministers - led to
a storm instigated by the extreme right. Riots and shootings took place
outside the National Assembly in Paris, and two governments were forced to
resign before the crisis abated.
Since the 1940s there have been no indications of systematic honours
trading, although the correlation between the honoured and individual or
corporate donations to party funds has at times been marked. As for MPs and
ministers, only a handful have fallen in recent decades for shady dealings.
On the Tory side sex, not money, has been the grim reaper: the only
prominent national politician tainted by a corruption scandal was Reginald
Maudling, who resigned as Home Secretary in 1972 after disclosure of a
business association with the notorious John Poulson.
However, the Poulson affair showed that corruption flourished in parts of
local government, which had become a mighty spender and regulator. For 20
years Poulson's architecture and construction empire manipulated officials
in local government, the police and the health service, including T. Dan
Smith, Labour leader on Newcastle council, who received Pounds 155,000 from
Poulson to establish public relations companies.
Poulson was not an isolated case. Other corruption cases involved councils
in Birmingham, south Wales and Dundee; and a series of cases involving the
police also surfaced. A 1976 royal commission report on standards in public
life decided to treat them as isolated incidents, but noted that the local
planning regime put 'greater strain than has been generally realised' on
councils, whose members 'may find themselves handling matters on a financial
scale quite beyond their experience of private life'.
Tighter rules on declarations of interests, and curbs on local authority
powers imposed by the Thatcher and Major governments, have restricted the
scope for local corruption, although recent cases in Westminster and
Wiltshire show that it has not vanished. However, a new form of sleaze has
emerged in the 1980s and 1990s: malpractice in the growing number of quangos
 -appointed government agencies, notably in the health and education
sectors, which now handle nearly a quarter of public expenditure, many
subject to lax regulation.
A snapshot of quango sleaze was provided this January by the Commons public
accounts committee, which published a report citing a string of cases
involving 'serious failures in administrative and financial systems and
controls'. The Welsh Development Agency was censured; other cases of misuse
of funds included Pounds 20m by Wessex Regional Health Authority, Pounds 10m
by West Midlands Regional Health Authority, and Pounds 1m by the National
Rivers Authority.
'Whenever you hear this sort of thing mentioned in Italy, Africa or South
America we just smile and say it could not happen here,' said Robert
Sheldon, the committee's chairman. Yet 'this sort of thing' ought perhaps
properly to be seen as but the latest incident in a British tradition of
sleaze.
Another concern is the current reformation in public administration, as the
'career for life' is undermined and officials are encouraged to move to the
private sector. 'Once you have the revolving door, there is always the
question of when the official negotiates for a future outside job, and how
strongly it is on his mind when carrying out public duties,' says
Pinto-Duschinsky.
Three themes emerge from a study of British sleaze over the past century.
First, all political parties have been involved - either (as in the sale of
honours) through a process of tacit agreement in shady but not illegal
practice, or (as in Poulson) through straightforward misuse of office.
Secondly, sleaze has not been limited to parties - witness the trail of
police corruption and the doings of quangos.
Thirdly, sleaze has resulted at least in part from an absence of definite
standards of public conduct. A recent survey of British MPs by Maureen
Mancuso shows that many have no idea where to look for guidance.
Mancuso asked 100 MPs for their views on, for instance, claiming first-class
but travelling economy and pocketing the difference, or getting
parliamentary passes for assistants who were paid by lobbyists. She found 'a
multiplicity of competing ethical standards' with no consensus. She divided
the MPs into groups which straddled parties: 'puritans', 'muddlers' and
'entrepreneurs'. A third of the MPs were 'entrepreneurs', willing to condone
'almost any activity as long as it does not contravene a written statute or
formal rule'.
In one respect, Britain's international reputation for non-corruption is
deserved: its elections are cheap, and the pressure on parties and
candidates to raise large sums is correspondingly low. The credit belongs to
Gladstone and a decision taken at the launch of the BBC. The limits imposed
by Gladstone in 1883 on local electoral spending have remained in force,
while the ban on television advertising by parties removed one of the main
objects of party spending in other democracies.
Constituency spending allowed per candidate in a UK general election is
barely Pounds 6,000. Little more than Pounds 20m was spent by the main
parties combined at national level in the 1992 election. In the US, more
than Dollars 750m is likely to be spent by candidates in the current
congressional elections. More than Dollars 400m was spent by the three
candidates in the 1992 presidential election.
In spite of what Dr Tim Hames of Nuffield College, Oxford, calls 'an orgy of
self-deperking' in response to recent scandals, the pressure on US
congressmen to raise money from corporate interests for elections is
all-consuming. Or it is for those who are not super-rich. Two-thirds of
senators are dollar millionaires. Ross Perot spent Dollars 65m of his own
money in 1992.
Nonetheless, Britain boasts a notable sleaze tradition of its own. The first
words of Lord Nolan after his appointment this week to chair Major's
commission on standards in public life might have caused Gregory and Poulson
to smile: 'As the prime minister said, this country has the highest
standards of integrity in public life: it is of the greatest importance that
those standards be maintained.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Aitken acts to clear name with hotel letters: Confusion over
payment of bill blamed on an accounting mistake by Ritz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the treasury chief secretary, last night published
confidential documentation with a view to clearing his name of allegations
that a business associate paid his bill at Mr Mohamed Fayed's Paris Ritz
hotel.
In a statement issued by the treasury, Mr Aitken said that confusion over
his FFr8,010 (Pounds 956.71) bill for a two-night stay at the Ritz was
caused by a mistake by the hotel, rectified five months later.
The statement, accompanied by photostat copies of letters and a cheque for
Pounds 426.88, followed allegations by The Guardian that part of Mr Aitken's
bill was paid by Mr Said Ayas, a former business associate.
Mr Aitken had been cleared of impropriety by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet
secretary, after disclosing that his wife paid half the bill in cash. But
the government had refused to publish documentary evidence said by Sir Robin
to prove that Mr Aitken had paid the bill in full.
Mr Aitken said his bill was drawn up, without his knowledge, in the name of
Mr Ayas. He said his wife was asked to pay FFr4,257 in cash, and several
months later 'when I went over the documents again', it emerged that Mr
Abdul Rahman, another guest whose room was booked by Mr Ayas, had paid
FFr3,753 too much and Mrs Aitken the same amount too little.
Mr Aitken said he sent a cheque for the sterling equivalent (Pounds 426.88),
and a letter of explanation to Mr Rahman. He said the letter, a copy of the
cheque, another letter from the hotel manager and the hotel receipt were
passed to Sir Robin more than six months ago. 'I hope that it is clear that
my bill was paid in full by my wife and myself in the circumstances I have
described, and that I made the full documentation available to the cabinet
secretary, as he has confirmed,' he said.
The cabinet office inquiry was established by the prime minister, Mr John
Major, after an unnamed informant allegedly acting for Mr Fayed made
allegations against a number of ministers. Two, Mr Neil Hamilton and Mr Tim
Smith, later resigned.
Mr Major told the Commons on Tuesday that the intermediary threatened to
publish allegations of ministerial wrongdoing unless a critical DTI report
into Mr Fayed's acquisition of House of Fraser, Harrods parent company, was
withdrawn.
A detailed note of the prime minister's conversation with the intermediary
has been sent to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, and
is being investigated by the police.
Mr Aitken's decision to release the evidence supporting his denial of the
allegations followed a further exchange of letters between Sir Robin and Mr
Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian. Sir Robin said the documentation in
his possession was a personal matter for Mr Aitken, suggesting that the
chief secretary was coming under pressure from Downing Street to end
speculation by releasing the evidence.
Mr Aitken won the full backing of his constituency association in Thanet
South last night. But his statement left some questions unanswered:
principally why the balance of the bill was paid five months after the hotel
visit - and after The Guardian began to inquire into the apparent
discrepancy.
Questions about the series of allegations of improprieties dominated the
prime minister's visit to Wales yesterday. He rebuked reporters who
questioned him about Dame Angela Rumbold's decision to resign from a
lobbying firm.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Tobacco companies face ban on adverts in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China plans to ban cigarette advertising in the media and in public places,
threatening moves by foreign tobacco companies to expand into potentially
the world's most lucrative market.
A new law, published in local newspapers yesterday, appeared to contain
provisions outlawing tobacco advertising that are more restrictive than
those in many western countries.
The law, due to come into effect in February, will ban tobacco advertising
in films, television, newspapers and magazines. Advertising is also
'forbidden' in waiting rooms, theatres and cinemas, conference halls and
sports venues.
The Chinese smoke one-third of the world's cigarettes and the prospects of
continued growth in the market have attracted foreign makers, facing
flagging markets in the west. In Beijing, the representative of a leading
tobacco company said the law appeared highly restrictive, but the company
would seek clarification.
Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco of the US, and Rothmans International of the
UK have established manufacturing joint ventures in China, and other
companies are exporting. All are operating in an industry dominated by
China's state tobacco monopoly, which has 96 per cent of the market and is
reputedly the world's biggest cigarette producer.
One British manufacturer said that restrictions could make it harder for
foreign companies to woo smokers away from Chinese brands.
Companies have been spending heavily on advertising in China. Philip Morris,
through its Marlboro brand, sponsors the national soccer league, and others
are also active in the sporting arena. Cigarette advertising on hoardings is
also widespread, although whether it will survive the new law is not clear.
Tobacco industry representatives attribute the new law to China's desire to
bring itself into line with international standards.
Interest among foreign companies in China market is understandable, given
the numbers involved. A survey last year by the State Statistical Bureau
showed 298m people over the age of 15, nearly 35 per cent of the population,
smoke.
However, China has been reluctant to expose the lucrative state monopoly to
foreign competition. and has made entry difficult for foreign companies.
Heavy restrictions are placed on imports of cigarettes, through high tariffs
and other barriers, but this has not stopped a flood of foreign imports. In
1990, a Chinese newspaper estimated that less than 1 per cent of foreign
cigarettes on sale in China had passed through customs - the rest were
smuggled.

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, next president of the European Commission, was last night
close to a deal over the apportioning of new portfolios, the first test of
his grip on colleagues and clout with member states.
Pressure was increasing on the two hold-outs - Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Hans
Van den Broek - to fall into line at today's meeting in a Luxembourg chateau
attended by the new 21-strong Commission.
A deal would enhance the reputation of Mr Santer, who has displayed a shrewd
touch and a steely determination during tense negotiations over portfolios.
The chief obstacle remains the allocation of responsibilities in external
relations, with Sir Leon, the chief EU trade negotiator, reluctant to cede
responsibility for relations with central and eastern Europe to Mr Van den
Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, who is in charge of political
affairs.
Sir Leon would retain the powerful multilateral trade portfolio as well as
relations with the US and Japan; but he would lose a plum area since one of
the main tasks of the next Commission will be to lay the groundwork for EU
membership for Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Mr Van den Broek is also uneasy about Mr Santer's plan to assume personal
control over foreign and security policy, though he has received assurances
that he will still be responsible for orthodox diplomacy.
Officials close to Mr Santer portray the foreign policy plan as a bid to
break up personal fiefdoms.
Others suspect he intends to dilute the Commission's role in foreign
policy-making in deference to the member states.
On Thursday, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister whose bid last
summer to succeed Mr Delors failed only because of a UK veto, warned against
the Commission yielding powers which it won in tHe Maastricht treaty.
One surprise is the expected announcement that Mr Franz Fischler, the former
Austrian agricultural minister, will take over the farm portfolio, which
accounts for half of the annual Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) EU budget.
Other key posts expected to be agreed today include the Emu portfolio to Mr
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, a French civil servant; transport to Mr Neil
Kinnock, the former UK Labour party leader; internal market to Professor
Mario Monti, a leading Italian economist; and fish to Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, a Norwegian diplomat.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Deutsche Bank puts its money on London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, yesterday emphasised
London's pre-eminence over Frankfurt as an international financial centre by
deciding to put all its international investment banking activities in the
UK capital.
It is combining its activities with those of Morgan Grenfell, the UK
merchant bank which it bought in 1989 for Pounds 950m, a few days before Mr
Alfred Herrhausen, Deutsche Bank's former chairman, was murdered by
terrorists.
Mr Hilmar Kopper, who succeeded Mr Herrhausen and worked with him on the
Morgan Grenfell acquisition, said the bank would continue to support
Frankfurt and expand its activities there. Its Frankfurt investment banking
operations, serving German corporate, institutional and other customers,
will stay in the German city. The move,
marks a change of strategy for Deutsche, which was previously keen to keep
Morgan Grenfell as a separate subsidiary.
Deutsche said yesterday that the integration of its and Morgan Grenfell's
investment banking operations would happen 'over time', and changes to its
organisational structure would be 'evolutionary'.
It said a new investment banking board would be established under the
chairmanship of Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, Deutsche Bank board member, and would
also comprise Mr John Craven, Morgan Grenfell's chairman, and Mr Michael
Dobson, Morgan chief executive, who will run the combined operation.
'Investment banking is an Anglo-Saxon business,' said Mr Schmitz. 'We want
to achieve the global integration of our investment banking business. This
cannot be done in Frankfurt. It has got to be in London. New York is outside
our time zone. Europe is of overwhelming significance for us.' Mr Kopper
said customers expected a range of services from investment bankers. 'A
truly European bank must have an integrated pan-European management
operating from its largest market - that is London for international
products.'
Together, the Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell investment banking
operations employ more than 6,000 people. Last year, Deutsche earned a
pre-tax profit of nearly DM2bn (Dollars 1.34bn) from investment banking with
Morgan Grenfell's profits totalling Pounds 236m.
Helped by changes in the law and a more relaxed attitude to new financial
instruments by Germany's Central Bank, the Bundesbank, Frankfurt has made
progress towards becoming a more effective financial centre. But bankers
agree its future lies less in competing with London as a global centre and
more as an important regional centre.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Scottish Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The City has no doubt that Scottish Hydro-Electric was harshly treated by
its regulator when the company's new pricing regime was announced last
month. Its shares have underperformed the sector by almost a fifth since
August when Professor Stephen Littlechild announced price caps for the 12
regional electricity companies in England and Wales. That regime should
allow the RECs' distribution businesses to make a real rate of return of
around 7 per cent, as will the cap announced for Scottish Power. Yet
Scottish Hydro claims its rate of return on distribution will be squeezed to
less than 2 per cent.
In rejecting the new cap and forcing a reference to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, the company appears on strong ground. In its review of
British Gas, the commission suggested an appropriate rate of return for a
utility would be 6.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent - a judgment that the
electricity regulator took into account in his review.
Scottish Hydro seems to have been singled out for special treatment because
the price corset at privatisation was tied too tightly. Treating it equally
now would mean allowing the company's distribution prices to rise
significantly relative to other regions. After the political furore that
followed Prof Littlechild's generous treatment of the RECs, it is not
surprising that he was reluctant to take such a course.
There must have been a temptation to follow the water regulator's example
with South West Water and pass the hot potato to the commission.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Markets on both sides of the Atlantic had worked themselves into such a
state of nerves ahead of the US GDP numbers that even the distinctly mixed
figures were met with a huge sigh of relief. The initial alarm created by
the 3.4 per cent growth figure only exaggerated the bounce when traders
digested the lower-than-expected price deflator. Yet this probably had more
to do with the shape of trading books ahead of the news than any change in
sentiment.
Those worried about US inflation were not cheered by the low deflator
figure. Their argument is precisely that the Federal Reserve is being lulled
by good inflation statistics and will not take the stern action required
until it is too late. Nor were they impressed by the large element of stock
building in the GDP figure since they believe that inflation is already
working its way through the system as a result of past growth.
In London, by contrast, markets are more inclined to accept the Bank of
England's relaxed view about UK inflation prospects - something likely to be
reinforced by next week's quarterly inflation bulletin. This has helped
gilts outperform the US and German bond markets. Yesterday's rally made up
most of the ground lost earlier in the week. Shares did even better with the
FT-SE 100 up 51 points on the week. But they still remain largely at the
mercy of Wall Street. Judging by recent experience yesterday's recovery in
US bonds and the dollar is likely to be short-lived.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken Deutsche Bank five years to decide to integrate its investment
banking activities with those of its Morgan Grenfell subsidiary. Even so,
yesterday's belated decision to do so gives Germany's largest bank a
sporting chance of joining the investment banking big league with the likes
of Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Its decision to locate the headquarters
of the operation in London also strengthens the City's position as Europe's
pre-eminent financial centre. Other Continental banks, seeking to develop
their corporate finance and international equity businesses, may feel under
pressure to follow suit.
The decision is undoubtedly a blow to Frankfurt. Efforts to bolster
Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - have not
succeeded. Germany may be Europe's leading industrial power, but its
financial system remains relatively underdeveloped while its equity markets
are over-regulated and illiquid.
Deutsche Bank will not find it easy to achieve its ambitions. While Morgan
Grenfell still has a strong presence in corporate finance, neither it nor
its parent is known for equity research and trading. There is also a big
question over whether Deutsche can successfully merge its solid but slightly
stodgy culture with Morgan's more entrepreneurial spirit. One reading of the
decision to locate the investment banking headquarters in London is that
Morgan's culture will come up on top. But, given that Deutsche has yet to
agree a name for the business, it would be a mistake to bet on it.

FT  29 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Pocketing battleships
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for VSEL is more likely to be decided by high politics than high
finance. British Aerospace is campaigning for GEC's rival bid for the
warship-maker to be blocked on competition grounds. So far, there is no
definitive word from the Ministry of Defence. But GEC's purchase of a 14 per
cent stake in VSEL suggests confidence on its part that the bid will receive
the necessary approval.
BAe's decision to focus on politics reinforces the impression that it has
little chance of winning a straight financial fight. GEC's cash offer is
worth 12 per cent more than BAe's paper offer. The financial logic of
merging with VSEL is so attractive that BAe will be tempted to improve its
bid. But the company is not in a position to put up cash and, if it offers
more paper, its share price would fall - so diminishing the value of a
higher bid. Meanwhile, the group knows GEC could easily use its cash
mountain to top any improved offer. GEC's current bid of Pounds 14 a share
should enhance the group's earnings by around 2 per cent, giving it scope to
pay more cash without suffering dilution.
VSEL is a pawn in a wider battle between GEC and BAe. Lord Weinstock, GEC's
managing director, is anxious to force BAe to agree to a merger of the two
groups' defence businesses before he retires. Without VSEL, BAe's balance
sheet would be stretched. The company would find it harder to take the
write-offs necessary to restructure its troubled turboprop business. That
does not mean a BAe deprived of VSEL would automatically fall into Lord
Weinstock's lap. But the pressure would be on.

FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris puts on 2.5% ahead of
long weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Traders called it the 'mauling of the dollar bears'. US economic data came
in with less of an inflationary feel than expected and currencies, bunds and
equity futures responded, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS regained the 1,900 level for the first time since October 18, the
CAC-40 index climbing 47.58 to 1,905.69 for a 2.5 per cent gain both on the
day and on the week. Turnover, boosted by the expiry of October futures, was
FFr6.1bn. French markets will be closed on Monday and Tuesday for public
holidays.
Eurotunnel, up 20 centimes at FFr19.20, shrugged off news that the COB, the
market watchdog, had launched an official inquiry into whether the channel
tunnel operator had presented its financial position fairly in its rights
issue prospectus published in May.
The other Euro stock, EuroDisney, added 35 centimes to FFr7.10 ahead of
full-year figures due next Thursday. Analysts did not expect surprises in
the figures, since the bad news was already in the price, and forecast
losses of between FFr1.6bn to FFr1.8bn.
Sanofi put on FFr11.90 to FFr259.90 before reporting an 8.8 per cent gain in
nine-month sales.
FRANKFURT did not emphasise short covering, or the percentage point rise in
the Dow at the US midday. However, a 27.12 rise to 2,040.32 in the Dax on
the official session, which left it up 0.9 per cent on the week at this
point, was left far behind in the post bourse where the Ibis-indicated Dax
put on 38.49, or 1.9 per cent at 2,064.86.
The day, and the week was marked by relative strength in chemicals. BASF,
Bayer and Hoechst rose DM8.40 to DM318, DM8.50 to DM350 and DM4.60 to
DM325.60 by the end of the afternoon; Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett said
that the sector had been excited by Thursday's progress report from ICI, and
anticipation of third quarters from DSM, Akzo Nobel and Rhone Poulenc next
week before Germany's 'Big Three' report later in November.
Turnover rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.4bn. BMW was the carmaker of the day as it
produced nine-month turnover figures and the shares rose DM17 to DM771 after
hours. Deutsche Bank moved from underperformance during the session to
outperformance in the afternoon, where it closed DM17.50 higher at DM739.
ZURICH's rise of 31.9, or 1.3 per cent in the SMI index to 2,490.5 left it
4.5 per cent down on an introspective week.
UBS closed well off its worst for the day, but the bearers still dropped
another SFr12 to SFr1,200 and the registered SFr2 more to SFr273, reflecting
the board's battle over voting powers with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision.
Among insurers, however, Winterthur climbed SFr19 to SFr634 ahead of a
progress report next Thursday.
AMSTERDAM made a resolute end to the week, the AEX index closing up 5.18 at
409.05 for a week's improvement of 2.3 per cent.
There were good rises in a number of stocks reporting third quarter figures
next week, among them Philips which rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 54.10 in heavy
volume, and DSM, up Fl 1.10 to Fl 147.80.
Royal Dutch saw one of the best performances, lifted by the dollar and a
good overnight set of results from its US subsidiary, Shell Oil, closing
with a gain of Fl 5.60 to Fl 195.20.
Nutricia, the manufacturer of baby food, was lifted Fl 1.80 to Fl 89.80 on
reports that Unigate of the UK might be about to sell its 32 per cent stake.
Unigate denied the reports.
MILAN remained focused on the banking sector following Thursday's news of a
L2,000bn bid by Credito Italiano for Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo, which,
said some brokers, could herald a shake-up in the sector.
The Comit index ended up 11.48 at 624.21 for a 1 per cent rise on the week.
There were suggestions that the next bid target could be one made by Banca
Commerciale Italiana, up L72 at L3,462, for Ambroveneto, up a further L442
to L4,774 on top of a 11 per cent gain on Thursday.
Romagnolo, which said that the takeover bid was 'not friendly' put on L798
to L16,878, while Italiano added L16 to L1,605.
MADRID moved from depression to ebullience, the general index rising 4.32,
or 1.5 per cent to 295.33 on the day, but only 0.7 per cent on the week.
Turnover was up from Pta19bn to Pta25.1bn, a lot of that in banks which were
relatively muted in share price terms. Gains of Pta55 to Pta3,255 in BBV and
Pta60 to Pta4,835 in Argentaria compared with rises of 2 to 3 per cent in
the big ADR stocks, Endesa, Repsol and Telefonica, 3 per cent or more in
constructions and Pta770, or 5.8 per cent in Acerinox, the stainless steel
group, which reported a 72 per cent gain in nine-month pre-tax profits on
Thursday.

FT  29 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Complicated backdrop as Dow
gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks surged yesterday even though an initial reading on third-quarter
economic growth was much higher than forecast, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 55.51 higher at 3,930.66, despite
the NYSE's 'downtick' restrictions on program-guided buying imposed around
midday.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 7.92, or 1.7 per cent,
at 473.77, as advancing issues on the Big Board outnumbered declines by
nearly a three-to-one margin.
Volume was heavy for the fourth session in a row, with some 383m shares
traded by the close.
In the other leading markets, the American SE composite was 3.07 better at
458.16, and the Nasdaq composite was up 8.68 at 776.48.
The powerful advance was staged against a complicated technical and
fundamental backdrop. It was triggered by a solid gain in bond prices, which
came in spite of the announcement that the economy had expanded by a bigger
than expected 3.4 per cent in the three months to the end of September.
The Treasury market had expected a 3 per cent gain but a sell-off failed to
materialise because of some surprisingly good inflation news contained in
the report, and suggestions that the economy might start to cool off rapidly
in the current quarter.
The upturn pushed the yield on the 30-year government bond below 8 per cent
for the first time all week. The rally gathered strength around midday on
rumours, later denied by Washington, that the G7 industrial nations would
meet in an emergency weekend session to consider ways to prop up the dollar.
Share prices paralleled the action in bonds, as the mood of relief allowed
equity investors to retrace some of the ground lost over the past fortnight.
The Dow industrials had backtracked in five out of the past six sessions,
even though the earnings news flooding the market over that time was
overwhelmingly positive.
Among the best performers Caterpillar climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 5/8 ,
United Technologies Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 3/4 , IBM Dollars 2 to Dollars
76 5/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 64 1/4 .
Airline stocks were up sharply for a second day running. UAL, parent of
United Airlines, jumped Dollars 6 to Dollars 95 1/2 , Delta climbed Dollars
2 1/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 and AMR, parent of American, put on Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 55 1/4 .
The technology sector showed impressive strength, too. Motorola was Dollars
2 1/4 ahead at Dollars 58 5/8 , Texas Instruments was Dollars 1 1/4 better
at Dollars 75 and Compaq Computer up Dollars 2 at Dollars 40 3/4 .
Halliburton, an oilfield services concern, was marked up Dollars 4 1/4 to
Dollars 36 3/8 . Canada
Toronto stocks posted solid gains on release of the US quarterly GDP report,
which calmed expectations of a build-up of inflationary pressures in the US
economy.
The TSE 300 composite index added 23.16 points to 4,288.62, with advances
leading declines 463 to 311. Volume of 54.8m shares, valued at CDollars
801m, were down from yesterday's 78.8m shares at CDollars 1.12bn. The TSE
composite gained 3.5 points on the week. Potash shares, on the slide in
recent sessions, jumped 2 3/8 to 47.
Cott shares hit a new 52-week low, down 1 to 13 3/4 in active trading, while
Nova shares ended unchanged at 13 3/4 after heavy trading and good third
quarter figures.
Brazil
Sao Paulo continued its recovery as a return of foreign investors helped
improve the mood on the markets.
The Bovespa index rose 2,208 to 49,275, up from Thursday's 47,067.

The past month has been an unrewarding time for investors in Mexico's stock
market. Battered by poor third quarter results, the rise in US bond yields
and an uncertain political environment, the IPC index has lost about 6 per
cent of its value since the beginning of October, falling below the level
reached at the end of last year.
The drop has been most dramatic over the past week, following worse than
expected third quarter results from Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the
country's largest private company, which reported a rise of 1.5 per cent in
net profit to 7.14bn pesos. US brokerages reduced year-end estimates for the
company's earnings, and the value of Telmex's equity plummeted by 5 per cent
on Tuesday, the day after its results were released.
The steepness of the drop in Telmex's stock price took many analysts by
surprise, since the profits were only modestly below analysts' forecasts.
However, with investors already nervous about Mexico's economic and
political situation, and with US bond yields moving upwards, 'many were
looking for an excuse to sell the market', concludes Mr Borja Ussia of Grupo
Moneda in Mexico.
The stock market has proved especially vulnerable to movements in US bond
yields and Wall Street because of its dependence on foreign capital to
finance a current account deficit expected to reach Dollars 28bn this year,
or 8 per cent of GDP. The rise in US yields has forced Mexico to let its
domestic interest rates climb to attract the necessary foreign investment,
damaging economic growth and raising the financing costs of Mexican
companies.
'What is driving the market is the global liquidity shortage,' says Mr Jorge
Mariscal of Goldman Sachs. If US bond yields continue to rise then he
expects the market to suffer further - although in his view US bond yields
have probably peaked, meaning that the market is well-placed for a strong
recovery.
Compounding the rise in US bond yields have been adverse political
developments, following the presidential election in August and the
assassination of the number two official in the ruling PRI party at the end
of September. As a result, domestic interest rates have risen for four weeks
running, and now stand at over 14 per cent, or over 7 per cent in real terms
adjusted for inflation. The exchange rate has depreciated to 3.43 pesos
against the dollar, near the top of its permitted band.
'The political situation is tense, the economy is still not strong and
companies are not reporting good results,' says Mr Ussia. 'We have to
resolve these problems before investors return to the market.'
The Central Bank announced last week that reserves had fallen to Dollars
17.2bn, about Dollars 10bn less than the peak in February. The Central Bank
is thought unlikely to want reserves to fall below Dollars 10bn, giving it
little option but to permit further rate rises if the peso comes under
further pressure.
The political situation has deteriorated despite the convincing victory of
Mr Ernesto Zedillo in August's presidential election, largely because of the
assassination of Mr Ruiz Massieu, the number two official in the PRI, and
the man in charge of negotiating political reform with the opposition. Mr
Ruiz Massieu's assassination was allegedly ordered by a PRI federal deputy
from the state of Tamaulipas.
The assassination raised fears of a deep division in the ruling party,
between reformers and hard-liners, which could make the country difficult to
govern. Such concerns were fuelled by the deputy attorney-general
investigating the case - Mr Ruiz Massieu's brother - who appeared to blame
the murder on a group of old-style politicians, possibly acting out of
personal or ideological motivation, an accusation vigorously denied by the
PRI leadership, and not yet substantiated.
The fall-out from Mr Ruiz Massieu's murder has come at an awkward time, with
government ministers scrambling to position themselves for jobs in the next
administration. The unity that normally characterises Mexico's ruling party
in government has been noticeably absent in recent weeks.
Nevertheless, many analysts predict that the political climate will improve
when Mr Zedillo formally takes office on December 1. Mr Zedillo is expected
to appoint many of the cabinet ministers closest to Mr Carlos Salinas, the
outgoing president, to senior positions and deepen many of the economic
reforms that have characterised his presidency.
The economy is expected to pick up further next year, with a consensus
forecast of 4 per cent growth, compared to 2.5 per cent for this year.
Third-quarter results from banks and infrastructure companies indicated that
credit growth and investment was picking up. Meanwhile, exports have
increased rapidly, helped by a depreciation of nearly 10 per cent in the
currency.
The stock market is cheap by regional standards, trading at about 16.5 times
1994 earnings, according to Morgan Stanley, compared to a multiple of about
18 times in Brazil and 20 in Chile. Arguing that much of the bad news is
already discounted, Salomon Brothers confidently asserted in a report this
week that investors will shake off 'Mexican fatigue' over the next couple of
months.

Tokyo
Speculative trading dominated activity, and the Nikkei index closed almost
unchanged, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 8.80 to 19,805.16 after a high of 19,904.08 and a
low of 19,725.65, down 0.5 per cent on the week. Shares initially rose on
buying by public funds and brokerage dealers; but the gains were eroded
later by selling of speculative shares, prompted by rumours that a consumer
credit company based in Osaka had been declared bankrupt. Arbitrage buying
finally supported the index just before the close.
Volume was 255m shares against 209m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 1.12 to 1,567.32 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.35 to 286.79.
Advances led declines by 485 to 462, with 207 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.57 to 1291.60.
Japan Tobacco, whose shares were listed on Thursday, closed down Y40,000 at
Y1.06m. Other privatised companies were also lower with Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone down Y2,000 to Y890,000 and Japan Telecom losing Y80,000 at Y3.6m.
Speculative stocks were sold on fears that credit for individual investors
could be squeezed. Daikyo, a condominium maker, fell Y6 to Y769 and Hanwa
Y17 to Y388.
Foreign investors traded steels and other commodity linked issues: Nippon
Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y2 to Y396 and NKK added Y6 to
Y297.
Calsonic, a car parts maker affiliated to Nissan Motor, rose Y27 to Y766 on
expectations of brisk earnings. However, car companies were sold on
profit-taking, with Nissan down Y8 to Y824 and Toyota Motor losing Y10 to
Y2,080.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 36.20 to 21,929.16 in volume of 44.7m shares.
Roundup
Wall Street's overnight gains had limited effect.
Malaysia cut income taxes in yesterday's budget but the absence of further
corporate tax cuts left its equity market relatively subdued.
KUALA LUMPUR saw selling in the final half hour of trade and after a high of
1,119.14, the KLSE composite index ended 11.30 up at 1,113.04, a fraction
down on the week.
Brokers said that with the budget springing no positive surprises, the
market may fall back into consolidation while investors look for fresh
direction.
SYDNEY lost its enthusiasm for commodity-based shares and the All Resources
index dipped 7.8 to 1,415.1 as the All Ordinaries finished 11.3 lower at
2,020.9, 0.7 per cent lower on the week.
Golds were among the weakest sectors, losing 1.5 per cent after the bullion
price slipped below USDollars 390 overnight. The oil and gas sector was also
weaker with Santos going ex-dividend, and Woodside Petroleum stock was upset
by a report that BHP was planning to sell its 10 percent stake, fallling 7
cents to ADollars 4.95.
BOMBAY faced selling pressure and the BSE 100 index fell 54.03 to 4,274.71,
0.8 per cent down on the week, as institutions made room in their portfolios
before a number of private placings.
HONG KONG extended its rebound to a third straight session, the Hang Seng
index adding another 74.89 to 9,379.47 which put it 0.4 per cent up on the
week.
Anticipation of a Sino-British deal on Hong Kong's new airport financing and
indications of an improving local property market continued to bolster
sentiment, but turnover stayed sluggish at HKDollars 2.53bn up from
Thursday's HKDollars 2.34bn.
Good demand for a recent luxury flat sale by its property unit took Swire
Pacific A up HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 57. Other property stocks also
firmed, with Sun Hung Kai gaining HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 57.25 and Cheung
Kong adding 50 cents to HKDollars 36.40.
WELLINGTON ended the day marginally positive, with the NZSE-40 index up 4.74
at 2,095.17, but 1.6 per cent better on the week after another solid
performance by Telecom, which rose 4 cents to NZDollars 5.64.
TAIPEI offered a weak rebound after four straight days of falls, the
weighted index closing 10.01 higher at 6,604.98, off a 6,561.71 low, 3.4 per
cent lower on the week in turnover of TDollars 41.7bn.

Black and white pepper prices were fully steady this week, reports Man
Producten. The week started with higher offers from India for black pepper
and the Malabar market has also been very firm. Short shippers continue to
eat away any carryover in Cochin. Whites prices for Indonesian supplies have
been rising quietly as Concern about the the effects of the dry weather has
increased. China is a seller but will soon run dry. The nutmegs and mace
market remained steady in origin, with limited offtake because most
industries are well covered until end this year. There were a few european
resellers taking profits by underquoting origins. When the current prices
survive this lull in the market we will certainly see a much firmer market
early next year, when coverage will be done for 1995. High grades of Cassia
are increasingly difficult to obtain.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Week in the Markets: Selling trims metal price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange base metal contracts mostly survived a wave of
pre-weekend profit-taking yesterday to end with most of the week's earlier
impressive gains intact.
The only substantial loser on the day was aluminium, which closed Dollars
14.25 down at Dollars 1,827.50 a tonne for three months delivery. But that
was still Dollars 74.25 up on the week. In a hectic morning session the
price had first soared to a fresh four-year high of Dollars 1,870 a tonne,
helped by news of another big fall in LME warehouse stocks, and then tumbled
to Dollars 1,810, before bouncing to Dollars 1,853. The sellers returned
after lunch, but not insufficient force to spark off the major 'correction'
some pundits have forecast following this month's 15 per cent surge.
Mr Tony Bird of the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy warned this week
that the multilateral agreement to curb aluminium production could collapse
'quickly and chaotically' if the price rise continued unabated. Mr Ted
Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, predicted
meanwhile that some trade delegates would be arguing for capacity re-starts
when signatories to the agreement meet next month. That did not mean the
agreement was about to collapse, he said, 'but it does suggest that it is
starting to crumble well before its end-1995 deadline'.
This sort of talk brought a response yesterday from Alcan, one of North
America's biggest producers of the metal, which cut its output by an annual
156,000 tonnes earlier this year. 'The fundamentals dictated the cutbacks;
the fundamentals will dictate restarts,' Mr Jacques Bougie, chief executive,
told reporters after a presentation at the Alumitech '94 conference in
Atlanta, Georgia. Stocks remained too high to permit a restart of capacity,
he insisted.
Copper was also helped early on by news of a further fall in stocks, though
much more modest than aluminium's. The three months price shot to a
four-year high of Dollars 2,690 a tonne before the profit-taking trimmed it
to Dollars 2,647. It closed at Dollars 2,658.50, up Dollars 15.50 on the day
and Dollars 102 on the week. The earlier strengthen of the market had been
fuelled by speculative buying, notably from US investment funds.
Zinc also attracted the attention of speculators as its LME stocks fall
speeded up. The announcement yesterday of a 2 per cent drop to 1.21m tonnes
encouraged a rise to a near-two-year high of Dollars 1,147 a tonne for the
three months position. It eased to Dollars 1,135.50, but was still Dollars
47 up on the week.
Nickel was the only LME metal to register a stocks rise yesterday, but that
did not prevent it building on its earlier strength during the morning, when
it touched Dollars 7,450 a tonne. Subsequent selling took the price down to
Dollars 7,335 at the close, down Dollars 22.50 on the day and up Dollars
347.50 on the week.
Tin followed a similar pattern, reaching a 22-month high of Dollars 6,070 a
tonne for three months delivery but closing Dollars 95 off that level.
At the London Commodity Exchange coffee futures sank lower as uncertainty
about the Brazilian weather outlook kept buyers on the sidelines. 'Everyone
is frightened to take a position,' one dealer told the Reuters news agency.
'Even the locals (traders operating on their own account) are scared to get
into the market.' He said a flurry of crop forecasts and rain forecasts from
Brazil had finally saturated an already nervous market.
At the close the January futures position stood at Dollars 3,488 a tonne,
down Dollars 70 on the day and Dollars 175 on the week.

FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters bought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was one of the
strongest performers in the FT-SE 100 as a good reception for the trading
figures combined with the impact of a strong dollar to send the shares
spurting forward 6 per cent on the day.
The market appreciated news that revenue for the third quarter rose 25 per
cent to Pounds 590m against the same period last year. Following warnings
from the company, the market had been expecting a slowdown in orders, which
had not materialised because of a reporting time lag. As such the figures
were above many forecasts. But the company is also a big dollar earner and
some of the rise - 30 to 477p - reflected the US currency's move.
Scottish Hydro called the expected meeting of analysts but surprised the
market by rejecting Offer's regulatory review of the Scottish generators,
thereby inviting a reference to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission.
Analysts said Hydro gave an impressive defence of its position and picked up
hints of the possibility of the MMC taking a hard look at rates of return
from the English recs, post their regulatory review, as it investigates
Hydro's claims of underfunding of its business. Dealers were alarmed at the
possibility that the MMC might reconsider its review.
Hydro shares initially fell to 307p on the news, but later rallied to close
5 higher at 318p.
Media group Carlton Communications built on recent strong performance as the
shares responded to consideration of a trading statement from Rank
Organisation. Both companies have video duplication businesses and Rank said
its operation was having a much improved year, with volumes up almost 50 per
cent and margins widening. Carlton's video and audio production and
distribution division accounted for more than half its profits for the six
months to end-March and analysts are hoping for good news when the company
publishes full-year figures in December. Carlton shares jumped 28 to 878p
but Rank was hit by profit taking despite a positive statement and the
shares fell 10 1/2 to 399p.
Good figures from US rival Omnicom helped advertising group WPP improve 2 to
111p.
The oil majors were in the vanguard of the market's advance, with
specialists highlighting the sector's obvious exposure to a strengthening
dollar. BP hit an all-time high in dollar terms, as US institutions chased
the stock in the wake of excellent third quarter results from the leading US
oil companies, including Shell Oil. At the close BP were 13 higher at 428
1/2 , just short of the peak 430p reached last month.
BP is scheduled to announce third quarter numbers on Tuesday. Specialists
also said there is an even chance that the dividend may be increased, with a
rise of up to 12 per cent a share a possibility.
Shell leapt 19 1/2 to 731p as the market warmed to its US subsidiary's
figures and subsequent broker recommendations.
Speculation has returned that Unigate, the milk producer, might be poised to
sell its 35 per cent stake in Nutricia, the Dutch group. The talk was
fuelled yesterday by reports that Unigate was holding a press conference.
The shares jumped 9 to 346p but it transpired that the conference was merely
an internal meeting and the stock ticked back to only a penny firmer at
338p.
BAT Industries was initially restrained by news that the Federal Trade
Commission would attempt to block the company's Pounds 600m takeover of
American Tobacco. The shares were off 5 at one stage but as one of the
stocks most sensitive to US currency and market movements it recovered to
close 7 1/2 better at 439 1/2 p.
Clothing manufacturer Campari fell 11 to 24p after interim losses of Pounds
3.96m against Pounds 3.09m loss last time.
Turnover of 10m in Standard Chartered was the fifth highest this year and
reflected continued heavy buying from one of the London market's leading
marketmakers; the shares edged up 4 to 290p.

FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: M &amp; S weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading stores group Marks and Spencer was restrained by a mix of technical
and fundamental factors and failed to benefit from the market bounce.
Expiry of options early in the week apparently prompted an influx of stock
and several big blocks of shares were said to be overhanging the market. The
weekly in-house magazine from rival John Lewis, published yesterday, pointed
to relative weakness in sales and there was a feeling the Lewis figures
reflected a wider trend.
The shares shed a penny to 416p and other stores groups were also weak.
Kingfisher slid 4 to 473p against suspicion that the company was beginning
to talk quietly and cautiously about Woolworth's trading. Sears softened a
half to 108 1/2 p.

FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Defence sector on alert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC's early morning delivery of an all cash offer worth 1400p a share for
submarines group VSEL and subsequent purchase of some 14 per cent of the
shares left the stock market with plenty to chew on over the weekend. News
of the counter bid pushed VSEL up by 72 to 1395p in turnover of 12m, sent
Vosper Thornycroft ahead by 14 to 71p but left British Aerospace languishing
at 459p, a decline of 16.
The initial reaction in the stockmarket was to talk of the bid in terms of a
knock-out blow. Lord Weinstock's offer tops the all share bid from BAe by
144p and outstrips BAe's cash alternative by 160p. But this approach
softened later as BAe showed itself determined to attack the GEC deal.
It opted to play the monopolies card, declaring the offer from GEC as posing
competition concerns. This led to speculation among some analysts that BAe
might just decide to increase the value of its all-share terms.
But the sheer power of GEC's finances - its cash balances of Pounds 3bn
exceed BAe's market capitalisation by around Pounds 1.2bn - were the main
talking point yesterday as GEC itself gained 8 to 278 1/2 p.
Brian Newman, electronics specialist at stockbroker Henderson Crosthwaite
said 'GEC's market raid effectively removes the financial engineering aspect
of BAe's bid for VSEL.' He said GEC will not relinquish its shareholding,
and that will prevent BAe from using its tax losses.

Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,101 at the 4:10 official close, a gain
of 59 points, and of 108 points in two days. The premium to the cash market
was 18 points with fair value premium around 15 points.
Traders said the quality of business improved dramatically allowing larger

FT  29 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US influences take equities higher in
London - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The end of the week brought a sudden swing to the positive side of the
equity market balance following a strong recovery in the dollar in the wake
of the latest data on the US economy. Backed up by gains in British
government bonds and in stock index futures, and finally by a burst of
strength in early deals on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 Share Index surged
ahead in late afternoon.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 54.2 up at 3,083.8, only a touch off the
day's high and spurred on by a December contract on the Footsie which was
moving above the 3,100 mark. The Footsie moved through a range of nearly 60
points, dipping to the 3,024 area at mid-session when the market became
nervous ahead of the US economic statistics. In the event, US markets took
the view that the unexpectedly large growth of 3.4 per cent in US gross
domestic product in the third quarter, balanced by unexpectedly low growth
in the deflator figures, could be seen as very favourable for the economy
and the securities markets.
A powerful upswing in the dollar, together with a gain of nearly 50 points
on the Dow Industrial Average in UK hours, sent the London market racing
ahead. Dollar stocks led the way, the strongest gain coming in Reuters, the
global electronic business information group, which also benefited from its
trading report. Oil shares, with the big names on the brink of the reporting
season, were also in demand. Insurance shares continued to brush off the
report on personal pensions from the Securities and Investments Board.
The market opened higher with much of the impetus coming from a dramatic
move in the defence industry when GEC launched a Pounds 531.7m counter-bid
for VSEL, the submarine builder, and later bought more than 13 per cent of
VSEL's equity in the stock market.
GEC shares rose sharply on its move, which tops the existing British
Aerospace offer for VSEL, although this still has the support of the VSEL
board. But Aerospace shares fell, reducing the value of its share offer, and
the market appeared still uncertain of the outcome of the bid struggle.
At last night's close, the Footsie was showing a gain of around 1.8 per cent
over the week, but virtually all this came after 3pm yesterday. Trading
volumes have been drying up for the past month and marketmakers paid the
price yesterday when the sudden demand caught them without stock on their
books.
They responded by raising share prices quickly but were still obliged to
deal and then search for stock in the market to meet their commitments.
Seaq volume for the day totalled 508.9m shares, barely changed from the
previous session and a bargains total of just over 22,000 remained well
below daily averages for the past two years. Traders said that the
institutions had stayed out of the market, leaving marketmakers to scramble
for stock.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index rose by 21.5 to 3,501.6, somewhat left behind by the
focus on the blue chip issues which are closely linked to trading in the
stock index futures. Turnover in non-Footsie stocks, which are widely
represented in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index made up only about 56 per cent of
business yesterday, below recent daily averages.
Dealers sounded unconvinced by the sudden upturn in the market. Retail
issues were easier against the general trend on underlying worries that, in
spite of the favourable response to the latest US economic data, the chances
of a rise in UK base rates before Christmas are increasing as the domestic
economy shows signs of stronger growth than the Bank of England, and the
chancellor of the exchequer would like at this stage of the recovery cycle.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rallies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar rallied yesterday following the release of third quarter GDP
figures which prompted a sharp rise in the bond and equity markets, writes
Philip Gawith.
Although GDP growth of 3.4 per cent was above market expectations, the
report in total convinced the market that inflationary pressures were more
subdued than it had believed.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.5094, up from DM1.4950 before the GDP
figures, and touched DM1.5170 during the New York morning. Against the yen
it finished at Y97.335 from Y96.895.
The firmer dollar weighed on the D-Mark in Europe, and also depressed
sterling. The pound fell from Dollars 1.6370, before the GDP figures, to
Dollars 1.6235 at the close. It traded in a narrow range against the D-Mark
to close at DM2.4505 from DM2.4519.
Analysts said the dollar's rally had been driven mostly by short term
traders, many of whom had been forced to cover short positions they held
ahead of the GDP release. One observer described it as a 'typical Friday
afternoon short squeeze.' There were also reports that funds bought dollars
on the IMM futures market, driving the price up further.
Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the
GDP report had 'delayed the day of reckoning in terms of the Fed's decision
on interest rates.' He said this could work against the dollar. 'The
prolonging of the uncertainty is the main problem for investor confidence,'
he said.
Mr Marshall said it was difficult to be optimistic about the dollar 'with
the economy dangerously close to capacity constraints and a central bank
that appears to be dithering.'
For dollar bulls, there is some cheer to be had from a technical
perspective. Chartists said the dollar had, on a weekly basis, made a
reversal of its downward trend. After touching a low in July, it then traded
sideways until earlier this month. Chartists say it is possible this pattern
could be repeated, although the long term picture for the dollar is still
down.
The combination of the US GDP figures, and bullish comments about the UK
inflation outlook, from Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George, prompted a
rally in short sterling futures. The March contract traded 34,000 contracts
to close at 92.78, up from 92.66.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 610m late assistance to UK money markets
after forecasting a Pounds 1.1bn shortage. Earlier it had provided Pounds
344m assistance at established rates. Three month sterling LIBOR was
unchanged at 6 per cent.
Before coming under pressure from the dollar, the D-Mark was supported by
comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president. He told an
economic foundation in Bonn that 'a strong currency is in the best interests
of the German economy.'
Elsewhere, the South African central bank governor, Dr Chris Stals, said in
Johannesburg that a fairly substantial net inflow of capital from July to
September would hasten the abolition of the financial rand system, but 'not
now'. This caused the financial rand to weaken to R4.025 against the dollar
from R3.985.
In Nigeria meanwhile, the naira recovered on the free market to N90 against
the dollar, from a record low of N100. The government tried to fix the
exchange rate at N22 last January.

Belize Holdings, the Nasdaq-quoted company headed by the businessman Mr
Michael Ashcroft, chairman of ADT, yesterday took a first step in what the
company said was a strategy aimed at expanding its operations into central
America and the Caribbean.
The group bought for Dollars 13.5m a 75 per cent stake in Panama Holdings, a
new company established in Panama to invest in infrastructure projects in
that country.
Privatisation and a restructuring of companies there 'offer timely prospects
for entry into these businesses,' the company said.
Mr Ashcroft owns more than 50 per cent of the shares of Belize Holdings,
which held assets of Dollars 137m at the end of last year.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley wins Stet role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, has won a fierce contest to advise
the Italian government on the privatisation of Stet, the state controlled
telecommunications holding company.
The government announced yesterday the approval of the recommendation by
IRI, which owns some 65 per cent of Stet, to appoint Morgan Stanley. The
bank has played a big role in the privatisation or break-up of a number of
the world's biggest telecoms companies, including British Telecom and AT&amp;T.
Morgan Stanley was one of 21 firms in the competition which began late last
year. The government said an Italian adviser would be appointed in the next
few days to work alongside Morgan Stanley on equal terms.
Mr Stephen Waters, co-head of Morgan Stanley in Europe, said he believed it
would be possible to complete the sell-off next year. 'I think it is
important to get it off when it's ready to go. My own sense is that this can
be in 1995.'
The bank will help to shape the privatisation process and will play a role
in deciding who will handle the sale of Stet shares to international
investors.
Stet owns 60 per cent of Telecom Italia and other holdings in areas such as
manufacturing and software, and ventures such as Stream, the multimedia
company jointly owned with Bell Atlantic of the US. The sale is set to be
one of the largest in the international telecoms sector.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sweden's debt rating faces
downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moody's Investors Service, the debt rating agency, yesterday placed Sweden's
Aa2 foreign currency rating on review for a possible downgrade.
As a result, the Aa2 ratings on the foreign currency denominated bonds
issued by the Kingdom of Sweden, the Swedish Export Credit Corporation,
Forsmarks Kraftgrupp and Kummuninvest I Sverige, have also been placed under
review.
Moody's cited its concern about the continuing accumulation of public-sector
debt as a key reason for the move. 'Stronger economic growth, lower
unemployment and additional fiscal restraint expected from the recently
elected government suggest that budget deficits relative to GDP will
shrink,' it said. 'Nevertheless, the build-up in public-sector debt will
continue,' it warned. Moody's review will focus on the degree to which
policies can be forged over the medium term to strengthen the public sector
finances and improve the investment climate, it said.
Some observers were surprised by the timing of the announcement, coming just
days before Wednesday's fiscal statement by Mr Goran Persson, the new
finance minister. However, they said the move might serve as a reminder to
the government that its top priority should be to get its fiscal house in
order.
Mr Persson is expected to detail on Wednesday how he plans to undertake the
SKr61bn (Dollars 8.59bn) fiscal tightening the Social Democrats announced in
the election campaign.
Last week he proposed a further 20 per cent cut in government spending over
the next four years.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broker bids to gag the greenback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Money has always talked loudest on Wall Street, where salaries are often
measured in the millions of dollars, but yesterday the securities firm
PaineWebber sought to place a gag order on the greenback. It is suing two
rival firms to stop them from luring away its best staff with offers of huge
pay increases.
The saga started 10 days ago when PaineWebber bought the investment bank
Kidder Peabody, and its army of highly profitable stockbrokers, from General
Electric. Yet, before PaineWebber could welcome Kidder's employees to their
new home, several rival firms had poached some of Kidder's best brokers,
many of whom generate millions of dollars annually in commissions, from
under PaineWebber's nose.
This tactic - enticing staff away from one firm to another with offers of
hefty pay packets - is nothing new on Wall Street, but PaineWebber felt it
had to take drastic action to protect its investment in Kidder.
So yesterday, PaineWebber filed lawsuits against Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette and Dean Witter Reynolds, two of the biggest names on Wall Street,
charging them with trying to undermine its acquisition of Kidder Peabody by
offering Kidder brokers 'exorbitant' financial incentives to leave the firm.
The lawsuits followed reports that several top-producing Kidder brokers in
New York and around the country had left the firm to join DLJ or Dean
Witter. Merrill Lynch, another broking firm, was also said to have lured
away a team of brokers from Kidder.
Although there is nothing in US securities law that forbids the poaching of
employees, firms are not allowed to deliberately interfere with a
transaction such as the takeover of one firm by another.
So, PaineWebber is asking the courts to ban DLJ and Dean Witter from raiding
Kidder's staff.
The irony of the situation is that Kidder's top brokers are being offered
big pay increases to join other firms at a time when almost everyone on Wall
Street is having to accept a pay cut or, even worse, redundancy, as firms
endure a sharp slowdown in activity on financial markets.
The cost-cutting has dug so deep that the biggest names on Wall Street are
not immune to the axe.
On Wednesday, Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the prominent analyst who became famous
after warning clients to sell stocks before the stock market crash of 1987,
was released by her long-time employer Lehman Brothers because the
securities firm could no longer afford her million-dollar salary.
Fortunately for Ms Garzarelli, she is regarded highly enough within the
business that she should have no shortage of offers of employment from other
firms. PaineWebber, in fact, was one name linked this week to the former
Lehman star, but the firm may miss its chance to hire her if it does not
move fast. Rivals such as DLJ and Dean Witter may already have their cheque
books out, judging by their rapid raids on Kidder Peabody.
One firm which will almost certainly not bid for Ms Garzarelli's service, or
attempt to hire any Kidder brokers for that matter, is Salomon Brothers, the
big bond trading firm which has racked up huge losses this year.
On Thursday, Salomon announced it was cutting the pay of its top investment
bankers and traders by two-thirds.
Although the bankers and traders were told they could make a lot of money in
bonuses if they performed well, they were also warned that if they lost
money for the firm, they could expect to see their pay cheques shrink
accordingly.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Claims provisions hit earnings
at Aetna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings at Aetna, the US insurance group, were hit by further additions to
reserves to meet environmental claims during the third quarter, contributing
to a 25 per cent fall in operating earnings.
The Dollars 23m of extra reserves in the latest period come on top of a
Dollars 64m charge to cover indemnity-related pollution costs taken during
the previous quarter. The earlier provision had shocked investors, and
prompted concern that big environmental-related liabilities might lie buried
at other insurers as well. Hopes that a reform of the US Superfund
environmental clean-up law would ease insurers' liabilities in this area
have been dampened by the Clinton administration's failure to push through
legislation in recent months.
The addition to reserves announced yesterday, although causing less
consternation than the second-quarter charge, contributed to a slight fall
in Aetna's share price during the morning, against the background of a
strongly rising stock market.
Aetna's latest results were also held back by higher catastrophe insurance
losses, as the company added further to its estimate of the cost of the Los
Angeles earthquake at the beginning of the year. Catastrophe losses during
the third quarter were Dollars 28m, Dollars 10m more than the third quarter
of 1993.
These factors, along with capital losses of Dollars 11m compared with gains
of Dollars 13m a year ago, helped to mask an increase in underlying
operating profits in the commercial property/casualty business, from Dollars
48m to Dollars 59. Personal property/casualty profits slipped on higher
reinsurance costs.
Aetna's health and life insurance business, along with financial services,
posted profit gains, while it took net capital losses of Dollars 20m,
compared with gains of Dollars 29m the year before. Overall net income of
Dollars 129m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, was down from Dollars 226m, or
Dollars 2.03 a share.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: BMW shares advance on rising
sales and profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BMW's share price rose strongly yesterday after an upbeat statement from the
company which said turnover was outstripping record levels reached in 1992,
and fore-cast 'positive effects' on profits.
Sales, excluding the recently-acquired Rover group, rose 8.5 per cent to
DM23.8bn (Dollars 15.9bn) at nine months, BMW said. This was 1.5 per cent
higher than in the comparable part of 1992, when the full year's sales hit
DM31.2bn, it added.
The company, which last year saw net earnings tumble to DM516m from DM726m
in 1992, reported a 14 per cent recovery to DM290m on a sales increase of
7.4 per cent in the first half of the current year.
The group's share price jumped DM18 in early Frankfurt trading yesterday and
closed DM12, or 1.6 per cent, higher on the day.
The company's statement suggested production bottlenecks experienced in the
spring had been cleared, and forecast demand would be further increased by
new variants on the successful 3-Series, due shortly.
While car production rose 5 per cent in the nine months to the end of
September, deliveries to customers increased 7 per cent overall to 434,000,
with a 13 per cent surge in the last month of the reporting period.
Analysts at the Bayerische Vereinsbank calculated that production in the
third quarter was more than 8 per cent up on the year-earlier period, while
deliveries had risen 10 per cent.
According to earlier data, world sales of BMW marque models were up only 5
per cent in the first seven months of the year. Deliveries in Germany, up
only 2 per cent in the period to the end of July, were up 4 per cent after
nine months, according to yesterday's statement.
Sales elsewhere in Europe were in line with the overall market growth of 5
per cent so far. However, while deliveries in the UK rose 24 per cent to
39,000, those in the important Italian and French markets were unchanged at
24,200 and 18,700 respectively.
US sales, up 13 per cent after six months, were still 10 per cent ahead at
the end of the latest reporting period. At 63,500 vehicles, the nine-month
total was only marginally short of BMW's US sales in the whole of 1993.
Sales in Japan rose 8 per cent to 20,600, while 41 per cent growth in other
south-east Asian markets took deliveries there to 17,400.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: Eurotunnel stands by projections
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, yesterday firmly stood by the
projections given in its May rights issue prospectus as the French markets
watchdog began its second inquiry into the company this year.
'The report put together in May contained all the information that we had
available at the time,' the company said. 'We said the figures were subject
to change but they were right at the time of the rights issue.'
The response came after the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French
regulator, on Thursday night made public a letter to Eurotunnel announcing
the start of an investigation after the close of the London and Paris stock
exchanges.
It is concerned about the validity of the May projections and why the
company did not report sooner on the financial impact of a series of delays
since then.
The release surprised Eurotunnel, which expressed concern that the details
had been made public.
However, it is believed that the COB policy over the past few years has been
to make release details of any formal inquiries which are wide-ranging and
therefore likely to leak out to the press.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stega to seek funds via London quotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stega Pharmaceuticals, the Austrian biotechnology company, is to seek a
London listing to raise funds for the development of a 'revolutionary'
immune system stimulant.
The Linz-based group is moving its operations to Britain, where it plans to
develop and market its cytokine releasing agent vaccine, known as Cravac.
It claims the product could prove 10 times more effective than existing
treatments in stimulating the immune system to fight off infections.
'There is an enormous range of disease states that could theoretically be
treated with the aid of the product,' according to the company.
Pharmaceutical experts, however, reacted with scepticism and warned that the
release of cytokines - natural proteins contained in the immune system - did
not always prove effective.
'If all they're doing is stimulating the immune system, I cannot imagine it
would have a long-term effect,' said Dr Ian Hutchinson, professor of
immunology at the University of Manchester.
His concern was echoed by Mr Alan Munro, scientific director at Cantab
Pharmaceuticals, the leading UK biotechnology company, who warned that
cytokines could hamper the immune system in some cases.
Nevertheless, Stega said it would press ahead with plans to raise Pounds 7m
through a subscription offer, which would fund inital development of Cravac.
Dr Bernhard Lischka, Stega chief executive, said: 'This concept could
revolutionise medicine. We believe it will be effective in treating herpes
infection, some cancers and chronic skin disorders.'
He estimated that the potential world market for treatments for these
ailments would grow to Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.4bn) a year by the end of the
decade.

<TEXT>
First-half profits of Ajinomoto, Japan's leading food manufacturing company,
were hit by the hot summer weather, the discounting boom and increased
competition from imported foods due to the higher yen.
Sales were flat at Y298.1bn (Dollars 3.07bn). Interim recurring profits fell
13.1 per cent to Y11bn in spite of a 3.1 per cent rise in operating profits,
due to a 25.3 per cent fall in non-operating revenues. Profits from
securities sales fell 51.3 per cent to Y1.5bn. Net profits fell 33 per cent
to Y5bn due to appraisal losses on securities.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hiscox shelves listing plans after Pounds
27m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hiscox Dedicated, one of the pioneer corporate investors in Lloyd's of
London, yesterday shelved plans to seek a UK Stock Exchange listing after
raising Pounds 26.6m via a fully underwritten share issue.
But Mr Robert Hiscox, a director and a deputy chairman of the insurance
market, said the company remained intent on evolving into a fully-fledged
quoted insurance company operating under Lloyd's umbrella.
It intended to acquire 25 per cent of the Hiscox managing agency business,
which runs some of the London insurance market's most profitable syndicates,
with the object of buying the balance when Lloyd's rules were changed.
Moreover, the company said it intended to be quoted on 'a recognised stock
exchange' within five years. 'It will be a much better company to list when
it is merged with the management of the syndicates,' Mr Hiscox said.
Hiscox Dedicated is one of 25 companies which this year have invested Pounds
900m in the Lloyd's insurance market. Unlike many of the others, it invested
in only a narrow range of insurance syndicates and had been expected to seek
a listing this autumn as part of a fund-raising exercise.
But yesterday the company announced that Trident, a Bermuda-based company
investing in insurance and reinsurance, had fully underwritten a Pounds
17.7m open offer to existing Hiscox Dedicated shareholders and
warrantholders. Trident will also subscribe Pounds 8.9m through a placing of
Hiscox Dedicated shares.
The new shares are being issued at 110p a share, half payable on issue and
the balance when called.
Trident was formed a year ago by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's largest
insurance broker, J P Morgan, Mid Ocean, a Bermuda reinsurance company, and
Byrne &amp; Sons, a small investment bank.
Depending on the outcome of the offer, Trident will own up to 68.35 per cent
of Hiscox Dedicated's ordinary share capital. However, it is seeking
shareholders' approval for not making a general offer.
To allow Hiscox Dedicated to buy the Hiscox Syndicates management agency,
Hiscox Holdings - parent company of the latter - plans to demerge its
non-managing agency activities. These include Roberts &amp; Hiscox members
agency, which acts for Names, and R K Harrison, an insurance broker and
financial adviser.
The funds raised will be invested on four Hiscox managed syndicates, raising
Hiscox Dedicated's share on each from between 4 and 5 per cent to about 11
per cent.

Mixed first-half results for Japan's heavy industry groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's heavy industry manufacturers and shipbuilders reported mixed
first-half results due to the yen's sharp appreciation and a weak domestic
economy in the first half of 1994.
Fortunes were divided, depending on the different mix of businesses each is
involved in, but sales from shipbuilding, large power plants and steel
structures for the private sector were generally lacklustre.
On the other hand, the government's public spending programme increased
sales from waste disposal facilities, now becoming a growing business for
heavy machinery makers.
While the companies said the yen's sharp appreciation had not yet affected
sales - as large orders, particularly for ships, that are being translated
into sales now are yen-denominated - it was biting into profits. A one-yen
rise against the US dollar has the effect of wiping of Y1bn off profits,
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries indicated.
At the same time, private capital spending has remained weak in Japan, and
not all companies were able to balance this with firm orders from the public
sector.
But on the whole, shipbuilders were able to cut costs and raise
profitability through increased procurement of lower-priced parts from
overseas and reductions in fixed costs.
One of the better performers in the half was Kawasaki Heavy Industries,
Japan's second largest shipbuilder. Its shipbuilding division enjoyed a 42
per cent rise in sales. Sales in its industrial plant and steel division
rose 36 per cent while its environmental and power plant unit rose by 30 per
cent.
But its motorcycle business was hit by the yen's appreciation, forcing it to
revise its full-year forecast for total sales by Y10bn (Dollars 103m) as it
expects the impact of the strong yen to continue to put pressure on
motorcycle sales.
At the other end of the scale was Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding which
reported a 69 per cent drop in recurring profits and passed its interim
dividend. Mitsui suffered from a sharp 50 per cent fall in its industrial
plant division.
Mitsui, Hitachi Zosen and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the country's biggest
shipbuilder, alike saw weak sales in their shipbuilding divisions.
Mitsubishi said compared with the same period a year ago, the first half was
also devoid of major building projects such as the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in
Osaka and a huge leisure park in Miyazaki prefecture which boosted the steel
division last year.
At the same time, sky-park parking lots suffered a downturn in demand amid
Japan's still weak economic condition while an absence of new thermal and
nuclear power plants depressed sales in its power systems division.
Ishikawajima-Harima HI was likewise affected by the lack of nuclear power
plant sales, which was the main factor behind its 16 per cent fall in
mid-term sales.
While the companies have managed to keep orders relatively stable, there was
general concern that the yen's strength would begin to show through in the
next fiscal year as shipbuilding orders are increasingly denominated in
dollars and other currencies rather than in yen.

FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: JAL returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan Air Lines disclosed unrealised foreign exchange losses of Y43.9bn
(Dollars 453m) as it reported a return to profits in the first half of 1994.
The airline said the losses result from a purchase of Dollars 3.6bn in
10-year forward contracts dating from 1986, which the company made to hedge
the risk of buying US dollars to pay for aircraft procurement.
Since JAL bought the forward contracts the yen has appreciated sharply,
resulting in huge unrealised losses to JAL. The company will not disclose
any past losses resulting from the contracts.
However, new finance ministry regulations required JAL to disclose its
remaining unrealised losses of Y43.9bn which represents the difference
between the amount in yen that JAL will pay for the dollars it is committed
to buying and the market rate.
The disclosure comes as JAL announced a turnround in its business
performance on the strength of increased overseas travel by Japanese.
In the six months to September, JAL revenues rose 5 per cent to Y526.4bn
from Y500.4bn a year earlier. Recurring profits improved to Y20.6bn from a
loss of Y7.9bn and net income was Y11.7bn against a net loss of Y3.4bn.
Total accumulated loss for the company still amounted to Y43.4bn against
Y55.1bn at the end of the last fiscal year.
New lower economy class fares and the yen's rise led to a sharp gain in
international passengers, numbers increasing by 16 per cent and revenue from
international travel rising 12 per cent.
The airline expects the rest of the year to bring similar conditions to the
first half. It forecasts sales of Y1,020bn against Y982bn, recurring profits
of Y1bn against a Y26.2bn loss and break-even at the net level against a
Y26.2bn loss.
The company is undergoing a major restructuring and will pass both the
interim and final dividend.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bullers, the giftware and media group, yesterday confirmed its intimated
rights issue and announced a reduced first-half loss of Pounds 402,000.
It is seeking to raise Pounds 1.26m via the issue of 7.02m shares at 20p on
a 1-for-7 basis.
The group, which underwent a capital reconstruction in March, said yesterday
that all but one of its subsidiaries were trading profitably.
The proceeds are intended to eliminate the overdraft and short-term
borrowings, which amount to about Pounds 523,000, and for working capital.
In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax loss was reduced by Pounds 599,000.
Sales of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 1.11m) included Pounds 711,000 from
acquisitions.
Clashfleet, acquired in March, forms the media division, which contributed
operating profits of Pounds 51,000 on sales of Pounds 430,000.
Losses per share were 1.5p (0.88p).

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: OMI Intl expands with Pounds 7m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMI International, the manufacturer and supplier of products and services
based on the application of measurement technology, yesterday announced it
was to acquire Castlet, a private company, for Pounds 7m.
Castlet manufactures electronic devices and control systems used mainly to
collect dust and other particles from waste gases such as those emitted by
power stations.
To pay for the acquisition, OMI is proposing to raise Pounds 9.5m net of
expenses via a rights issue of 27.8m shares at 37p each on a 5-for-8 basis.
The shares closed at 43p yesterday, down 6p.
In addition to the purchase price, the share issue will provide Pounds 2.5m
of extra working capital. It has been fully underwritten by Barclays de
Zoete Wedd.
Castlet made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.01m on turnover of Pounds 7.4m in
the year to April 30 and on completion of the deal should be free of bank
debt and have net assets of not less than Pounds 2.7m.
OMI also announced results in line with expectations for the six months to
September.
On sales down slightly from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 17.4m, pre-tax profits
for the half year fell from Pounds 237,000 to Pounds 18,000.
Mr Gil Williams, chairman and chief executive, said the electro-optics and
instrumentation businesses had performed well and had healthy order books,
while the move of Thin Films to Plymouth remained on schedule for the fourth
quarter. Forward Industries also met expectations.
Logistics, which had a disappointing second half last year, had shown a
marked upturn, he added.
Borrowings over the period rose by Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 8.59m - giving
gearing of 71 per cent.
Earnings were nil (0.5p); the interim dividend, however, is maintained at
0.75p.
BZW, the house broker, has upgraded its current year profits forecast from
Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.3m.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Investors face a credibility gap - Why the
energy industry is puzzled by RJB's bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks after the government announced its preferred candidate to take
over British Coal's English mining assets, the coal and electricity sectors
remain perplexed.
Industry executives are struggling to work out why RJB Mining is prepared to
pay so much more than anyone else for the pits and opencast sites and why
the government believes its plan is feasible.
'I just cannot understand it,' said one electricity executive. 'We think
that RJB is assuming far too much both for the future market and for the
prices it can get. Are we missing a trick?'
RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank advising it, remain
unperturbed, saying they have a high level of confidence that they can raise
the funds needed for the bid and for working capital, together thought to
total Pounds 1.08bn.
However, they are not revealing any details of the Pounds 900m deal, which
is due to be concluded on December 24.
In the absence of any guidance from them, speculation is rife. One theory
among British Coal executives who may soon be RJB employees is that RJB will
haggle down the price in the 'due diligence' process in which it is now
engaged.
'RJB has the government over a barrel,' says one. 'The government will lose
so much face if it declares a deal with RJB is not possible after all.'
Other merchant banks are less sure. 'The government would not accept that
kind of haggling,' says one banker. 'BZW would lose considerable face with
the government.' His argument is that the due diligence exercise could trim
tens of millions of pounds from the price, but is unlikely to get it down to
the Pounds 600m which was the next highest bid.
If the eventual price remains about Pounds 900m, how can the bid be funded
and the resulting debt paid off? RJB is thought to want to raise about 40
per cent of the Pounds 1.08bn through issuing shares and the rest, about
Pounds 600m, through debt.
Most of the failed bidders for the English regions, as well as Scotland and
south Wales, have either been told, or have assumed, that any debt incurred
through a successful bid would have to be paid off by the end of existing
contracts with the electricity generators in 1998.
It is thought that BZW's business plan for RJB assumes the debt will be paid
off by 1998, although the banking facilities lined up for it do not require
this.
The Pounds 600m of debt would be likely to attract interest rates of at
least 8 per cent. The amount of income left to RJB to pay off the debt and
cover the interest bills depends on production costs.
In the English regions, coal is currently being produced at an average of
about Pounds 1.20 a gigajoule, against an average selling price in the
contracts of about Pounds 1.40.
That implies a profit of 20p a gigajoule which equates to Pounds 4.80 a
tonne. As the English regions have contracts to sell 29m tonnes of coal a
year to the generators the difference between the selling price and
production cost would be about Pounds 140m a year, or Pounds 455m until
April 1998 at current cost levels.
There will also be more limited income from selling household coal, where
margins are high, as much as 50p per gigajoule, but volumes small, at 2.5m
tonnes and falling. British Coal struggles to make money on industrial coal
sales of about 5m tonnes in the English region, but RJB could make profits
if costs are reduced. It would also hope to make sales to to other UK
regions.
With only limited scope for sales growth, the key to greater profits is
clearly cost reduction in the mines. If RJB can get costs down to Pounds 1 a
gigajoule, as rival bidders acknowledge is possible, annual selling
price/production margins from electricity contracts would double to Pounds
280m a year. However, reaching Pounds 1 would take time.
In addition, producing coal in the private sector also results in financial
penalties. Dividends will need to be paid on the Pounds 400m or so that RJB
raises in equity and the company will also have to pay for insurance at
market rates, something British Coal has been able to avoid. Nor will it
enjoy the pensions holiday that British Coal has benefited from in recent
years.
Making an assessment of the effect of all these factors is difficult prior
to RJB announcing its plans, probably next month. RJB is thought to dispute
strongly contentions by Mr John Reynolds, an analyst at James Capel - broker
to rival bidder Coal Investments - that RJB could still be Pounds 200m in
debt by the end of 1998.
If, however, Mr Reynolds' predictions were realised, RJB's ability to pay
off the debt would depend on the English market after 1998.
Most bidders assume that the two main generators will buy 20m-25m tonnes of
coal a year from the purchaser of British Coal's three English regions at
Pounds 1.10 a gigajoule after 1998. They believe RJB is expecting about 30m
tonnes at perhaps Pounds 1.25. A large majority of both generator and coal
industry executives believe the lower figures are the more likely.
The credibility gap is narrowed considerably by the endorsement of RJB's
plans by both BZW and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which has advised the
government. In choosing the preferred bidders, the government said it was
guided by considerations about preserving the largest economically viable
coal industry as well as tender prices.
Nonetheless, RJB and BZW have a challenging task ahead to convince lenders
and investors that the doubters have got it wrong.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Reuters lifts sales 25% in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Reuters Holdings rose by 30p to 477p after the financial
information and news group said its third quarter revenues rose 25 per cent
to Pounds 590m.
For the first nine months, sales grew by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.68bn, with
no material impact from exchange rate movements. Reuters, which started
giving quarterly statements this year, does not give profit figures.
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'Revenue continued to forge ahead
reflecting good business conditions as well as recent acquisitions. New
order rates for information products, though below the recent peaks we have
seen, were brisk.
'Electronic transaction products for the financial markets continued to be
the fastest growing part of the business.'
Acquisitions added Pounds 42m to revenue in the third quarter and Pounds 97m
in the nine months. Excluding acquisitions made since the beginning of 1993,
revenue growth was 17 per cent for the quarter and 16 per cent for the nine
months.
Sales growth by Instinet, the US-based equity brokerage service, and
Thamesway - the institutional broker acquired last November - contributed to
a 37 per cent rise to Pounds 138m in the quarter's overall transaction
product revenue.
Information management systems for dealing rooms increased sales 87 per cent
in the quarter, and over the nine months this product line's sales more than
doubled to Pounds 82m. This contributed to a rise of 20 per cent, to Pounds
1.19bn, in information products' revenue so far this year.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: US investor set to publish Heron offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The takeover of Heron International, the indebted property group headed by
Mr Gerald Ronson, will move a step closer early next week when the full
offer document from HNV Acquisition, the US investment group, is published.
HNV, led by Mr Steven Green, the US investor, made a formal offer five weeks
ago. Since then it has been involved in complex negotiations with Heron's 82
creditor bankers, owed more than Pounds 1bn.
The US group, which emerged as the Heron board's preferred bidder last June,
has offered cash and share alternatives to debt and bond holders in its
attempt to restructure and recapitalise the group.
However, bondholders now have to approve the offer. Last May, 62 per cent of
them voted against accepting any further delay in payments due from Heron,
which scuppered a Pounds 1.4bn refinancing deal by the banks and
precipitated the move to sell the company.
Yesterday, one rebel bondholder said: 'Presumably nothing has changed with
the HNV offer - the pricing is such that it gives bondholders no real
attraction in taking the cash or the equity. We hope apathy will rule and
the offer falls.' Another bondholder voiced his concern: 'We would prefer
some sort of debt instrument as an alternative,' he said.
But Mr Basil Vasilou, chairman of Vasilou &amp; Company, which speaks for a
large number of non-bank bondholders, yesterday voiced his support. 'People
would be crazy to reject this deal. It offers you whatever you want, be it
equity, cash, or a combination. No other offer would be able to match these
terms.'
The original offer involved Pounds 450 cash or 300 HNV shares for every
Pounds 1,000 of senior debt, Pounds 60 or 40 shares for every Pounds 1,000
of junior debt, and 750p or five new shares per old Heron share. Sources
close to Heron said the full offer document contained few changes to the
initial offer. This includes the retention of Mr Ronson and his management
team, a move which has caused consternation among some of the group's
creditors.
The HNV plan would transform Heron's balance sheet, turning a negative net
worth of Pounds 172m as at March 31 into net assets of about Pounds 200m.
HNV, which would control at least 51 per cent of Heron shares, also intends
to subscribe to a Pounds 17m convertible debt issue, which it can increase
to Pounds 30m, to provide extra working capital.
Other members of the HNV consortium include Mr Rupert Murdoch, the media
magnate, Mr Craig McCaw, founder of McCaw Communications, the US telecoms
giant, and relatives of Mr Michael Milken, the former junk bond dealer.
Mr Green has said he intends to turn Heron into a force in the European
property market.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barr chairman urges nephews to halt revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, yesterday urged
his nephews, Nicholas and Robert Barr, to halt their shareholders' revolt.
In a letter to his nephews, who claim majority support among voting
shareholders of the motor distribution and leisure group, Mr Barr described
their position as 'incomprehensible'.
The letter came after a private meeting, brokered by an independent member
of the Barr family, had failed to end the family feud. Nicholas and Robert
Barr have pledged to replace their uncle as chairman and have called an EGM
to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance
director.
They have also declared their opposition to the board's plans to enfranchise
the non-voting A shares, owned almost entirely by institutions.
Mr Barr warned his nephews of institutional opposition to their plans, which
he claimed would expose the company to large compensation payments.
'Your actions have diverted management time away from the business; you have
caused disruption to the normal affairs of the company; and you have caused
or are in the course of causing considerable and unnecessary costs, as well
as exposing the company to very heavy potential liabilities,' he said.
The board delayed publication of a document concerning its own EGM on
enfranchisement, which ironically is one of the rebels' principal policies.
However, the Barr brothers, who command enough support to block the board's
proposals, argue that enfranchisement should only proceed under new
management.
In response to their uncle's letter, they said: 'We had hoped that in the
last 24 hours we had, on a private and confidential basis, moved forward.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods details trends in businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the waste services company, yesterday laid another brick in the
wall of its defence against the hostile Pounds 364m bid from Browning'Ferris
Industries of the US with a circular detailing trends in each of its five
businesses.
The circular precedes a third defence document, which is expected to include
a valuation of the business and results for the first quarter. This is
likely to be published on November 11, the last day Attwoods may release new
financial information under takeover rules.
Attwoods said yesterday the circular, which included few hard numbers for
1995, was intended to be a discussion document for investors. Profits
forecasts would be difficult, given the recent end of the company's
financial year.
'It is another brick and it is not a huge brick by any means,' said one
adviser. 'But there is a lot more to come.'
Attwoods said this document set out 'the specific factors underlying our
confidence in the future'.
These included: price increases and population growth in Florida, where
Attwoods' claims 32 per cent of the market. Cost-cutting, which would more
than offset the pressure on municipal contract renewals in that state.
Resolution of legal problems in the mid-Atlantic states and economic
recovery; plus a return to profitability in the medical incineration
business and restructuring in the German business.
BFI responded with derision. 'We wonder why they even bothered to release
this document,' the company said. 'They have provided little, if any,
substance as to why shareholders should feel confident in the future. The
arguments advanced for looking forward to a brighter 1995 just are not
there.'
BFI is offering shareholders 109p cash for Attwoods ordinary shares and 85p
per preference share. At current exchange rates this represents about
Dollars 9.20 per American Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary
shares.
Laidlaw of Canada, Attwoods largest shareholder, has accepted the offer.
Fidelity Investments, which holds almost 12 per cent of Attwoods and has
been selling recently, this week disclosed that it had purchased 46,100
ADRS.
BFI has said that it will pay the declared final net dividend of 3.25p, if
successful.
Attwoods shares closed steady at 113p.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Trading buoyant says Rank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rank Organisation said yesterday there had been a healthy rise in UK and
US leisure spending, resulting in strong increases in the group's turnover
and operating profit.
However, the shares fell 10 1/2 p to 399p. Analysts said there had been an
expectation that Rank's trading update would be even more positive.
Mr Peter Hilliar, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he had
increased his forecast of Rank's pre-tax profit before exceptional items
from Pounds 338m to Pounds 354m. Pre-tax profits in the year to October 31
1993 were Pounds 277m.
The group also said it was changing its year end in 1995 from October 31 to
December 31. The directors said the change would bring the group into line
with most other FT-SE 100 companies.
Rank said that turnover in continuing operations rose 10 per cent in the
period to end-September, with operating profit up 15 per cent. The film and
television businesses were performing particularly well.
The contribution from Rank Xerox was up by more than a third at the end of
July before restructuring costs. Rank's Pounds 62m share of restructuring
costs was charged against first half profit and Rank said the benefits had
begun to be realised in the second half.
Volumes from the video duplication business were up by almost 50 per cent,
while film laboratory volumes were up 12 per cent on last year. Odeon cinema
admissions rose 4 per cent.
The holiday business showed a small increase, with sales up 3 per cent on
last year. Bingo customers' spending was up 6 per cent, but admissions had
fallen by a similar amount.
The performance of casinos had improved, however, with attendances up 3 per
cent and spending per head up 7 per cent. Profit at amusement centres was
down.
Turnover at the Hard Rock cafes grew 7 per cent in the second half. Spending
per head at UK nightclubs was up 5 per cent and margins rose 3 percentage
points. Resorts in the US, however, had a difficult year.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Campari shares tumble pending further
revamp
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Campari International tumbled 11p to 24p after increased
first-half losses were accompanied by further rationalisation and
reorganisation of its troubled leisure and sportswear activities.
Directors said the costs of the moves, involving substantial cost-cutting
and centralisation of its Dutch support operations, would amount to Pounds
3.7m, to be taken in the second half.
Discussions had been held with its principal bankers and 'both the level and
continuance of their support will depend on the degree of success achieved
in meeting trading and cash management targets in the short-term.'
Difficult trading conditions and a 'disappointing' product offer led to
lower sales across the group's markets - turnover in the six months to June
30 dropped 13 per cent to Pounds 17.5m. A cautious outlook by retailers left
forward sales below budget and margins suffered as the group attempted to
clear stock.
After increased interest charges of Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 95,000), the
pre-tax deficit widened to Pounds 3.96m, against Pounds 3.09m. Losses per
share were 38.8p (29p).

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Chrysalis in Dutch TV deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysalis, the media and music group which has been building up its visual
entertainment division, is to buy 49 per cent of a Dutch television
production company.
The deal, agreed in the early hours of yesterday morning, marks Chrysalis'
first venture outside the UK.
The target is IDTV Holdings, an Amsterdam-based company that has the rights
to several popular European game shows, including Lingo and Boggle.
Chrysalis will pay an initial cash consideration of Pounds 3.79m, followed
by instalments of up to Pounds 1.74m a year for the next four years,
depending on IDTV's profits.
Further payments could be made under a share option scheme designed as an
incentive for the TV company's management.
IDTV made profits of Fl 4.2m (Pounds 1.5m) pre-tax in 1993 on sales of Fl
35.2m.
Put and call options exercisable from 1999 could lead to Chrysalis acquiring
the rest of the shares at a price based on IDTV's profits. The maximum total
consideration for the entire share capital is capped at about Pounds 18m.
Mr Chris Wright, Chrysalis chairman, said yesterday that serious
negotiations had started last April after the merger of two other
independent Dutch TV producers into a group called Endemol. Since then
Endemol had decided to start its own TV station, which would soak up most of
its own production.
'It's a very good deal,' he said yesterday. 'The way things have worked out
it's even better than what we anticipated when we start-ed.'
Mr Harry de Winter, the principal owner of IDTV, is selling because he felt
vulnerable after the Endemol merger, and he saw a link with Chrysalis as a
good strategic alliance.
The Dutch television market is similar to that in the UK. It also provides a
springboard into Scandinavia. However, Mr Wright said Chrysalis had no
further plans to buy into European television companies.

FT  29 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Institutions give tentative support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Institutions, unlike many in the coal industry, are prepared to give Mr
Richard Budge the benefit of the doubt, albeit anonymously.
'We do not believe Richard Budge is a megalomaniac who is going to ruin his
company: that, just to get his hands on the coal industry, he is prepared to
pay through the nose for it,' said one large shareholder.
The doubts surrounding RJB Mining's bid for the three English coal regions
have left its investors largely unmoved. For them, the issue of whether Mr
Budge is paying too much will be decided when the prospectus is published
next month.
RJB did the rounds of institutions several weeks ago and appears to have
received fairly strong indications of financial support for its plans.
'We had to give a ball park figure,' said one investor. Another confirmed
that RJB and its advisers asked 'for broad indications about what our level
of interest would be'.
However, undertakings were conditionally given when no one, not even Mr
Budge, knew precisely what the company would be offering for the coal
regions - or how many it might win. Initially, RJB is believed to have
presented tentative plans to bid Pounds 1.3bn for all five coal regions.
Thus, the institutions added heavy caveats to their support. 'It would
obviously be subject to price,' said one.
Yet backing will also be subject to Mr Budge's numbers adding up.
Institutions will look for reassurance that RJB will be able to pay off the
debt it incurs, that assumptions on the price for and volumes of coal it can
sell are realistic, and that it has the right structure and management to
take on such rapid expansion.
'We are not going to say yea or nay until we have seen the detailed
workout,' said one.
At the moment, shareholders remain confident they will be able to support
RJB. 'You have institutions pleased with the progress of the company,
impressed with the work they have done, and which would favourably view the
opportunity to get involved on a greater scale, subject to the numbers
making sense,' one party observed.
A more pragmatic view sees RJB's potential in a slightly different light:
'There are only two ways of making any real money - one is breaking a union
and the other is buying something off the government. Budge is doing both
and there is the prospect of making an awful lot of money out of it.'

administrative expenses and a changed investment mix. Earnings per share
were 3.59p, down from 4.04p, but the proposed final dividend is raised to
2.45p lifting the total to 3.3p, an increase of 4.8 per cent.

Europe Energy Group, which is transforming itself from a mining group, has
announced plans to acquire Helston Garages, a multi-franchise motor
dealership based in the south-west of England.
Its shares, which trade on the USM, were suspended at 5 1/2 p yesterday,
pending a further announcement. The terms of the deal have been agreed in
principle and contracts are expected to be signed in the next few weeks.
The consideration of about Pounds 10m will be financed via a share issue,
which will double the size of its capital.

in the half-year to June 30.
Continuing German losses prompted a review which resulted in a write-down of
assets and other costs amounting to Pounds 2.02m. In addition, Hewitt's
share of profits at Sphinx Technical came to Pounds 111,000 but after
providing for Hewitt's Pounds 444,000 share of restructuring costs, a loss
of Pounds 333,000 resulted.
The manufacturer of industrial ceramics and refractories paid increased
interest of Pounds 196,000 (Pounds 34,000).
There is no interim dividend (1.5p) and the final will be considered in
relation to the annual results. The share price yesterday fell 5p to 125p.
Sales in the first half rose to Pounds 6.16m (Pounds 4.36m) and there was an

FT  29 OCT 94 / Fuel for thought: The challenge of cutting costs in UK
coalmines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The four miners munching their sandwiches 900 metres down Clipstone colliery
in Nottinghamshire seemed oblivious to their frontline role in Britain's
coal revolution.
Until April 1993, they were working in one of Europe's deepest coalmines for
British Coal, the state-owned corporation. Since January, they have been
sweating in the same dark tunnels for RJB Mining - the mining company that
is the government's preferred candidate to take over most of the rest of
British Coal's deep mines in England.
RJB has bid Pounds 900m for the pits, at least 50 per cent more than the
next highest bidder. The gap has raised questions about RJB's assessment of
the coal market and the company's ability to cut operating costs.
Many analysts assume that, if RJB can make a profit from the coal where
British Coal failed, it will be because of the greater productivity it
squeezes from miners.
At Clipstone, RJB has managed to double output per man-shift, according to
Chris Daniels, colliery manager, through a combination of manpower savings
and greater use of multi-skilling underground.
But the men at the coalface, such as Martin Mulligan - who spent six months
on the dole between British Coal closing the pit and RJB reopening it - have
noticed little difference. 'We've got exactly the same team here, doing
exactly what we were doing in the old days, and we get paid almost the same
too,' he says.
The differences between what happens now and what happened in the old days
become evident further from the coal face. Daniels says there have been big
job cuts on the surface. 'There is now one man looking after the baths, the
lamp room, the methane pump house and the boiler room, where we used to have
five,' he says. There are now six people in management grades, where there
used to be 35.
With the zeal of the convert, he also insists that the RJB style of
management is making a big difference. 'British Coal was a very hierarchical
and slow-moving organisation with detailed custom and practice built up over
50 years. By comparison RJB is incredibly open and flexible,' he says.
The emphasis on the team means there is no place for union collective
bargaining at Clipstone or at the other mines RJB will take over. But both
Daniels and his boss, Richard Budge, insist that unions are still recognised
for everything short of pay bargaining.
On pay, Budge says he wants to keep the existing British Coal rates in most
areas, but he is not keen on the expensive incentive bonuses many miners
receive.
At Clipstone, pay is not an issue. It is a small pit with only one face open
and 250 men producing about 500,000 tonnes a year - compared with 700
producing about 1m tonnes under British Coal.
Sid Walker, the local official of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers who
helped to recruit most of the employees, says there has been no
deterioration in safety standards or in pay. He adds that he has not had to
deal with no any grievance problems.
Nine hundred metres underground Tony McPhee, a mechanic, says that
absenteeism has declined and the spirit is good. But the government gets no
thanks from men like him for handing over the industry to RJB.
'We've now got the opportunity to show the government that they made a big
mistake in writing off our industry. If RJB can do it then good for them.
I'm a socialist and I've got no qualms about working for (Richard Budge),'
he says.
This is music to Budge's ears. But Clipstone and the other two pits he
currently operates under licence are very different from the 15 deep mines
that RJB is negotiating to buy from the government.
Many or all of these are much larger: at Daw Mill and Welbeck in the
Midlands, for example, the combined weekly output is 20 times Clipstone's.
Pay packets are also bigger, thanks in part to the incentive scheme, which
lifts some miners' wages to Pounds 1,000 a week.
Another difference is that most of the men at Clipstone were hand-picked to
start work for a new company. They had been made redundant by British Coal
and, with payments of Pounds 30,000-plus in the bank, were less worried
about small changes to their pay arrangements.
At the 15 mines now under discussion, RJB will have to take over the
existing workforce under the rules of the European Union's Acquired Rights
Directive - known as Tupe in Britain. This means that British Coal's terms
and conditions, including pension rights, have to be taken over by RJB,
unless it can persuade miners to sign new contracts.
It also means that, if RJB wants to make redundancies among managers or
surface workers, it will have to pay the current British Coal rate of up to
Pounds 27,000.
Without the co-operation of miners at these pits, the scope to cut operating
costs could be restricted. And with RJB hoping to get rid of incentive
bonuses, that co-operation may be hard to win.
Mr Neal Greatrex, leader of the UDM, says: 'Budge thinks that he has got all
the aces up his sleeve, but he hasn't. We both want to save as much of the
industry as possible. But I don't want it to be at the expense of our
wages.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / The incredible shrinking chips: How miniaturisation is
boosting computer power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The astonishing pace of electronic miniaturisation, which has made possible
the information technology revolution of the past two decades, is set to
continue or even to accelerate for the foreseeable future.
Transistors and other electronic components on today's silicon chips are
one-thousandth the size of those in the early 1970s, and semiconductor
researchers say the technology is being developed to make them thousands of
times smaller still early in the next century. Since the capacity and speed
of computers increase as their components shrink, the outlook is for
dramatic further advances, with cars and domestic appliances acquiring the
processing power of supercomputers.
'Many new applications will emerge over the next 25 years which no one has
even thought of now,' Professor Michael Pepper, director of the Toshiba
Cambridge Research Centre, said this week, as he announced a breakthrough
which could keep the miniaturisation process going after current chip
technology reaches its fundamental physical limits. 'Think of all the
changes in computing and communications in the last 25 years, and try to
extrapolate those 25 years ahead.'
The centre, a collaboration between the Japanese electronics company and
Cambridge University, has developed a process for making 'quantum effect
integrated circuits'. The components on these chips are so small  - no more
than 10 atoms across or 100,000 times thinner than a human hair - that the
electrons in them behave both as particles and waves, in accordance with the
somewhat bizarre predictions of quantum theory. They are making positive use
of an effect that will eventually limit the miniaturisation of conventional
chips, because electrons leak out of their circuits when they become too
small.
A quantum chip, the size of a fingernail, could contain 1,000bn memory cells
or logic gates, switching at 1,000bn times a second. And it would consume
virtually no power - a big advantage for portable applications, compared
with today's battery-draining chips.
Most of the world's semiconductor makers are experimenting with quantum
devices. Toshiba says its great achievement is to find a way of
mass-producing them at reasonable cost on integrated circuits, like
conventional chips. The process is based on a technique for laying down
single layers of atoms with molecular beams.
Unfortunately, the quantum effects used by Toshiba are so sensitive that the
technology works well only when cooled in liquid helium to temperatures
close to absolute zero. A formidable technical effort will be required to
remove the need for special cooling.
Researchers at NEC's Tsukuba laboratories in Japan are developing a
different type of quantum device, the Surface Tunnel Transistor, which makes
use of a more robust effect that already operates at room temperature. 'We
expect to achieve an operational integrated circuit in the laboratory in
1997-98,' says Roy Lang, general manager of fundamental research at NEC.
Another Japanese company, Hitachi, has made an experimental 'single electron
memory' - which actually uses about 100 electrons to store a bit of
information - at its Cambridge Laboratory in the UK.
In the US, Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T, IBM and others are making encouraging
progress with quantum technology. All concerned are convinced that quantum
devices will eventually replace conventional electronics. But there is
vigorous scientific debate over which version of the technology will turn
out best in the long run, and over the likely timing of the transition.
Lang says: 'Quantum devices have to compete very seriously with present-day
silicon technology. People predicted in the past that silicon technology
would reach its limits much sooner and at much lower performances than is
actually happening.'
The first memory chips introduced by Intel of the US at the beginning of the
1970s held 1,000 digital bits of information on circuits 6.5 microns
(millionths of a metre) wide. The most powerful memory chips on sale today,
the 16-megabit D-Rams, have a capacity of 16m bits and a linewidth of 0.5
microns; the 64 Mbit generation, expected in 1996, will go down to 0.35
microns.
The conventional technique of optical lithography, which uses ultraviolet
light to write circuitry, will probably continue to work well for the first
gigabit (1bn bit) chips in about 2004. But their 0.18 micron linewidth may
be the lower limit, says Andrew Norwood, a semiconductor analyst with
Dataquest, the electronics industry consultancy. Below that, the wavelength
of ultraviolet light will begin to produce unacceptably fuzzy lines.
For the 4 Gbit generation, forecast for 2008, manufacturers are likely to
turn to X-rays, which can produce finer lines with their shorter
wavelengths. Earlier this month four leading US electronics groups - IBM,
AT&amp;T, Motorola and Loral - announced a collaborative venture with federal
funding to develop X-ray lithography for future chips.
Using X-rays and other new lithography techniques, such as electron beams,
the semiconductor industry may be able to push silicon chips through several
'gigabit' generations during the second decade of the next century.
Indeed Toshiba's Japanese research centre has shown the way this year by
designing an experimental silicon transistor just 0.04 microns wide, with
special features to prevent the electrons leaking away through quantum
effects. The company says this could be used to develop 100 Gbit memory
chips.
But at some point conventional silicon will reach its technical limits.
Whether new-style quantum devices begin to make significant inroads into the
semiconductor market before then will depend not only on fundamental
technological factors but also on manufacturing costs.
One of the clouds hanging over the industry is the exponential growth in the
cost of building new chip fabrication plants or 'fabs'. As conventional
chips have become more complicated, the total price of a fab has risen from
Dollars 20m in the mid-1970s to at least Dollars 1bn. Mitsubishi of Japan
estimates that its total investment in developing and manufacturing the 1
Gbit generation of memory chips could reach Dollars 15bn - more than for a
new aircraft.
According to Intel, the leading microprocessor manufacturer, conventional
silicon may reach an economic barrier to miniaturisation when linewidths
fall below 0.18 microns, because X-rays or electron beams may be too
expensive for the industry to install, even on a collaborative basis.
At that point quantum chips will be cheaper to manufacture, their advocates
say. Prof Pepper concedes that the Toshiba process is technically complex,
with several stages, but he insists that it 'is highly manufacturable'.
Another possibility is that entirely new production techniques - for
example, using 'scanning probe microscopes' to manipulate individual atoms -
will be developed to make atomic-scale quantum devices at reasonable cost.
The best guestimate is that quantum chips will reach the market for
specialised applications in about 10 years. They might become the main
agents of the information technology revolution around 2015.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Issue is aromatics rather than lead
in petrol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PETTMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a professional chemical engineer, but with no interest in the
refinery industry, perhaps I could put another side to the 'green fuels'
story ('MPs spark row over risk from 'green' fuel', October 26).
The presence of the carcinogen benzene in petrol has no relevence to whether
the petrol is leaded or unleaded. Benzene and other aromatics are added to
petrol by the refiners to increase the octane value and recent surveys show
that there is very little difference in benzene levels between leaded and
unleaded petrol in the UK and Europe. Benzene levels are permitted in Europe
up to 5 per cent (by volume), but in reformulated gasoline in the US the
limit is 1 per cent. There is no technical reason why European refiners
could not meet this level, by adding processes like isomerisation,
alkylation or adding oxygenates such as MTBE or TAME to petrol.
It would seem a pity to confuse the issue over unleaded petrol, which has
obvious environmental advantages, when what is required is a standard for
Europe to reduce benzene to the US level or lower.

FT  29 OCT 94 / A convergence of cultures: Deutsche Bank's merger plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading commercial bank, has decided to show the
banking world a more aggressive face.
Few people in the financial world have doubted its muscle - it is a triple-A
rated bank with assets of more than DM570bn (Pounds 232bn). But many have
questioned whether the bank was prepared to use its strength to the utmost
to carve out more business at home and abroad.
Yesterday, Deutsche Bank served notice that it intended to become a more
powerful force in investment banking worldwide by putting all its business
in this competitive, fast-growing sector in London. This comes five years
after it paid a generous Pounds 950m for Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant
bank that forms a key part of this strategy.
At the same time, the bank is acting in its domestic banking market to
eliminate regional branch management layers, speed up decision-making and
get closer to its German customers.
What the bank is trying to do is maintain the benefits of its universal
banking structure - combining the whole range of banking services under one
corporate roof - while also moving deeper into the less familiar territory
of investment banking, which specialises in the business of raising capital
for companies and governments.
If it is to succeed, the bank will have to meld two very different cultures.
'How a 175-year-old English institution operates is very different from a
how a universal German bank operates,' says Mr John Craven, chairman of
Morgan Grenfell.
Germany's universal banking tradition is nurtured on long relationships with
corporate loan customers and reliable, risk-averse private savers, who put
most of their money into fixed-interest deposits.
Investment banking does not come easy to German bankers: German investors
prefer bonds to shares, and much of the country's share capital is owned by
banks and other companies. Innovations such as derivatives, though now
commonplace, caught on slowly.
Yet if the bank is to become the world financial force that Mr Hilmar
Kopper, its chairman, feels is justified by its size and strength, it will
have to make the effort.
'The bank has still not really punched its weight on the international
scene,' says Mr Bryan Crossley, European banking analyst at Hoare Govett,
the securities firm. 'This is a step towards doing so.'
Mr Kopper makes no secret of the fact that one reason for the Morgan
Grenfell purchase was to learn from the innovative, freewheeling Anglo-Saxon
way of doing business. Germany's consensus-minded approach leads to
consistency and quality. But it can be a handicap in rapidly evolving
financial markets and new technology-based industries.
Even so, Deutsche Bank is not proceeding with speed. The investment banking
businesses of Deutsche and Morgan Grenfell will be integrated 'over time'
and changes to the organisational structures will be 'evolutionary'.
Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank board member who will head its new
investment banking board, said yesterday: 'What we are doing now is to start
the process that will lead to the merger of the investment banking
activities of Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell. There is no new legal
entity as yet, but it will happen.'
He hoped the merger would also provide valuable feedback to the
non-investment banking operations of Deutsche Bank. 'We hope it will give
Deutsche Bank another culture and help to speed up the other things we are
doing.'
The consensus approach to business has not been abandoned entirely. But
'Deutsche Bank is continuing to move on and we don't want to lose time', he
adds.
So why has it taken five years to start the integration of the two sides'
investment banking activities? When Deutsche Bank acquired Morgan Grenfell
in 1989, it was keen not to submerge the merchant bank's identity and
demotivate its employees. A 40-page memorandum of understanding spelt out
the operating agreement between them.
With this history in mind, it is understandable that a move to integrate the
investment banking operations has taken years to evolve. 'We're not putting
factories together, but people,' says Mr Schmitz. 'We have to look after the
whole thing as gently as handling a raw egg.' Even after mulling over the
move for five years, the terms of the merger suggest both parties remain
ambivalent about integration.
The new investment banking operation will not carry the name of both
organisations, but there is no agreement on what the name will be. Deutsche
Bank has not committed any specific amount of additional capital to the
operation, which it will surely need.
Moreover, the expanded equities operations in London will be administered by
Deutsche Bank's equities team. However, Mr Craven says it is likely the two
firms will operate out of the same premises.
According to Mr Michael Dobson, Morgan Grenfell's chief executive who will
run the combined investment banking group, the main goal of integrating the
investment banking businesses is to build a UK and international equities
business capable of raising capital and selling shares around the world.
Morgan Grenfell has concentrated its UK business on corporate advisory work,
helping companies to devise strategies for raising capital and to complete
mergers and acquisitions. It also has strengths in emerging markets,
especially in trading third world debt. But when it comes to selling shares
in the UK and internationally, Morgan Grenfell lacks the research, trading
and sales teams necessary for it to become a world-class force, having
abandoned these in 1988.
Mr Craven concedes its shortcomings. 'There is no significant UK equity
distribution and what we have internationally is very fragmented,' he says.
Morgan Grenfell's competitors speculate the only way it will build a UK
distribution network will be to buy a stockbroking firm. However, Mr Craven
says the group has 'no concrete plans for filling the gap' in its UK
distribution network.
The merged operation will be able to draw on distribution capacity in
Germany, Australia, the Far East and to a lesser degree, in the US and on
the Continent through subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell.
However, these units have operated independently of each other, hindering
Morgan Grenfell's ability to sell large blocks of shares worldwide.
The integrated model that Deutsche Bank now says it is prepared to follow
has been adopted by the most successful investment bankers. 'Deutsche Bank
is finding the Goldman Sachses and the Morgan Stanleys of this world coming
into their own backyard,' says the head of corporate finance at a rival.
US and UK banks have perfected the integrated model that blends the
underwriting, research, sales and trading functions with corporate advisory
business.
'Morgan Grenfell's great strength has always been its ability to identify
clients who will do a lot of business with it over the years,' says one
London-based corporate financier. 'And they have been very good at executing
deals. But this move shows the value that investment banks will have to
place on distribution.'
The question, some of Morgan Grenfell's competitors say, is whether it has
delayed the move to integration too long.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed and shocked to see the FT front page picture
depicting the scene of the tragic bomb attack in Tel Aviv which left 22
people dead ('Israel firm on peace despite blast', October 20). Is this
necessary? The picture showing a body and severed limbs reveals a total lack
of respect for the victims of such a horrific attack. To see this image must
undoubtedly have a devastating effect on the relatives of those who died.
Do you not agree that a more subtle image could have been used? A photograph
should be used to support or clarify the text. In this case, it could add
very little to the description of the attack given in the article, which was
sufficient for FT readers to imagine the horrors of the scene for
themselves.

Sir, With reference to David Blackwell's article 'Making a meal of a dog's
dinner' (October 25), I discovered last Saturday why the pet food market is
so lucrative.
Reason: pound for pound at my local Tesco superstore the cheapest brand of
dog biscuit is more expensive than digestives.
In tests my dog showed a clear preference for digestives - he found them
easier to dunk.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Locking not a good step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES PICKTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Jackson's assertion (Letters, October 26) that 'Given
adequate convergence, the idea of irrevocable locking of member currencies
at an earlier stage than domestic use of the Ecu seems increasingly
attractive' is wrong headed, for the following reasons:
The divergence of member countries' inflation rates, tax rates, and national
debt is far too great for convergence to be realistic. Even if the member
nations manage their affairs sufficiently well that the (Eu)topia comes
about, then convergence will be natural and formalities unnecessary.
'Irrevocable locking' is tantamount to the single currency. It would remove
the present ability of different areas to devalue or revalue the currencies
continually and automatically, thereby adjusting factors of production and
maintaining the balance of trade. The result of locking will be additional
depressed areas and endemic unemployment, particularly in the areas where
such conditions already exist. The Maastricht treaty already allows for this
by creating 'cohesion funds and structural funds' for the rich areas to
patronise the poor areas.
Your interview with Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary
Institute ('Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief', October
24) is a timely reminder that the threat of the single currency is ever
present, even after the ERM debacle.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hindsight not best basis for pensions
compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J L ROBERTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In considering the question of compensation for 'wrong' advice in
personal pension purchases, the Securities and Investments Board surely has
a duty to those insurance policyholders who largely will foot the bill for
compensation ('The high cost of bad advice', October 26).
'Best advice' is given at a particular moment in time and requires a careful
assessment of present circumstances and future prospects. It cannot,
however, require prescience. If, years later, it appears that the outcome is
poorer than if an alternative course had been taken, this in itself is far
short of sufficient basis for concluding that the advice was not 'beat
advice' at the time given.
In the late 1980s:
1) Some company schemes were (and still are) badly run, with high costs and
poor investment performance.
2) Most schemes had no guarantees of pension increments.
3) Many schemes had disadvantageous early retirement conditions.
4) Defined benefit schemes were dependent upon increasing employer
contributions, which in turn were dependent upon continuing profitability.
5) Unit trusts, unitised pension funds and the underlying equities, despite
October 1987, had shown consistent long-term growth patterns.
6) Personal pensions offered control, visibility and direct investment into
a booming UK economy.
All this made the background to forming a view of 'best advice' different
from the one now being used with the benefit of both hindsight and
subsequent legislation improving company schemes' benefits and
accountability.
For compensation to be due, it should be necessary to demonstrate
conclusively that the original advice cannot have been 'best advice' in all
the circumstances extant at the time it was given.
I trust that the investigations will not sanction compensation deemed to be
due by simplistic performance comparisons made with the benefit of
hindsight.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Political fighter feels the heat - Ryutaro
Hashimoto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the chain-smoking economic brain of the Japanese
government, and potential future prime minister, played with fire this week
but did not even burn his fingers.
To the surprise of many, he got away with making a tactless remark about
Japan's role in the second world war, despite arousing the criticism of
China - to which Japan usually kowtows - and both Koreas. Two less senior
cabinet ministers were sacked this year for making similar wartime gaffes.
The survival of Mr Hashimoto, minister of international trade and industry
and a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's right wing,
reflects Japan's commitment to finding a more distinct voice in Asia, and
the outcome of a power struggle within the LDP.
Mr Hashimoto's diplomatic misdeed was to say that it was a matter of
'delicate definition' whether Japan committed aggression against Asian
nations. He could hardly have given a different reply to a mischievously
posed opposition party question in a televised debate, supposed to be about
tax reform.
Yet the ensuing blast from Japan's neighbours and from senior members of the
Social Democratic party, one of the three partners of the ruling coalition,
made it look, for a moment, as if this martial arts expert was heading for a
quick political death.
That was until Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's Socialist prime minister, gave
his support to his right-wing colleague.
It was a notable gesture, given Mr Murayama's profound pacifism and Asian
sympathies and the fact that the leaders of the other two parties in the
coalition - Mr Yohei Kono of the LDP and Mr Masayoshi Takemura of the New
Harbinger Party - do not share Mr Hashimoto's ambivalent feelings about the
war. They feel it was a war of aggression, for which clear apologies are in
order.
Yesterday, South Korea issued an even more notable statement, to the effect
that it did not plan to make an issue out of Mr Hashimoto's gaffe, and China
toned down its criticism.
A relieved Mr Hashimoto duly expressed regret and sadness, and the affair
seemed to have been brought to a close.
There is a simple reason why such a storm blew itself out so quickly. China
and South Korea realised it was against their interests to press Japan too
hard on Mr Hashimoto and risk destabilising the sensitively balanced
coalition.
Mr Murayama knows that his cabinet cannot survive without Mr Hashimoto, the
aggressive lead trade negotiator with the US and one of the few cabinet
members with broad economic policy experience, as a former finance minister.
The two earlier errant ministers were disposable, holding humble environment
and justice portfolios.
But Mr Hashimoto's survival also seems indicative of a growth in Japanese
confidence about its relations with its Asian neighbours, such that it has
been willing to allow the controversy to play itself out.
Aspiring LDP leaders traditionally had to pay public respect to the families
of the war dead: an influential, if declining, part of the electorate. The
acceptability of, and need for, this reverance persisted in Japan due to the
lack of the kind of universal remorse for the country's wartime past seen in
Germany.
Mr Hashimoto, chairman of the bereaved war families' association, a
right-wing LDP group, clearly has his roots in such traditional sympathies.
Much to Mr Murayama's discomfort, Mr Hashimoto still leads an annual visit
by LDP politicians to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, where the war dead are
honoured.
He stands for a minority that feels uncomfortable over the fulsome apologies
for Japan's wartime record offered over the past year by two former prime
ministers and by Mr Kono, the dove-ish LDP foreign minister, who happens to
be Mr Hashimoto's bitter rival.
Allowing Mr Hashimoto his frankness about the war is only the latest example
of Japan exploring the limits of an independent policy in Asia.
Japan has also been standing up to China - as was clear last week when Mr
Hashimoto met his Taiwanese counterpart, in defiance of Chinese objections,
in the first official ministerial meeting between Japan and Taiwan since
Tokyo ceased diplomatic recognition of Taiwan 22 years ago.
Mr Hashimoto is a member of a pro-Taiwan LDP group dedicated to retaining
ties with Taiwan, a Japanese colony for 50 years until 1945. The influence
of this group was also instrumental in the admission of senior Taiwanese to
the recent Asian games in Hiroshima - a decision that caused another row
between China and Japan.
The other side of Japan's search for its own voice in Asia is its promotion
of Asian interests. It is playing a growing part in the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation forum, and has announced its support for Mr Kim
Chul-su, the South Korean trade, industry and energy minister, in the race
to head the new World Trade Organisation.
Mr Hashimoto now looks set to play a greater role in such policies. The
balance of power in the LDP moved in his favour last month, when Mr
Hashimoto's political patron, Mr Noboru Takeshita, the disgraced former
prime minister, rejoined the LDP's parliamentary group after a year in the
shadows as an independent.
But does Mr Hashimoto have what it takes to get all the way to the top? Mr
Kakuei Tanaka, a former LDP prime minister, believes the main qualification
for leading a Japanese government is to have few enemies. Here, by all
accounts, Mr Hashimoto's renowned arrogance may tell against him.
Aides recall how he exploded with rage at the July Group of Seven summit of
leading industrial states in Naples, when the foreign ministry failed to
tell his ministry about a letter from US president Bill Clinton.
On the other hand, Mr Hashimoto did take the trouble to give Mr Murayama, a
novice at the G7 and a former political enemy, a private briefing on how to
handle Mr Clinton. When Mr Murayama returned the compliment by supporting
him this week, Mr Hashimoto must have rejoiced in the one important enemy he
has managed to win over.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Tug-of-love over shipyard: The implications for the UK
defence industry of GEC's tussle with British Aerospace for VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for VSEL is a game theory problem. 'As long as the yard remained
independent both British Aerospace and GEC were happy. But once one of them
tried to buy the yard, the other had to follow, because whoever owns VSEL
has the prime position in the British naval defence industry. There is only
one bid contract going for the Royal Navy in the next 10 years and that is
for five Trafalgar submarines worth Pounds 2.5bn. Whoever owns VSEL will win
that contract.'
One defence executive's view of the tug-of-love battle which has developed
for the Barrow-based submarine maker between Britain's two defence giants.
It is a view which is supported by the history. Both British Aerospace and
GEC have been sniffing around VSEL for almost a year.
BAe almost bid for the company at the time it sold Rover in February, but
decided not to confuse the two issues. John Cahill, BAe's chairman, then
stood down and was replaced by Bob Bauman. It took the board several months
to rehearse the issues once more before deciding to renew takeover talks in
August. Once BAe's half-year financial results were declared in
mid-September, the way was open for a bid.
GEC meanwhile had crawled all over VSEL's accounts in May, but had decided
not to bid. It viewed the company as too expensive to buy, and provided BAe
did not bid, GEC was happy.
Once BAe struck, however, the rules of the game changed. GEC could no longer
assume that it stood a decent chance of winning the Trafalgar submarine
order without owning VSEL. GEC immediately demanded access to the documents
BAe had seen in its talks, as it is entitled to do under the takeover rules.
After two weeks poring over them, GEC launched a Pounds 14 a share cash bid
first thing yesterday morning - against BAe's all-share offer worth Pounds
13 a share on Thursday night - and bought 14 per cent of VSEL's shares in
the market. The phoney war for VSEL was over, and the real fight was on.
Yet while the future of the Pounds 2.5bn Trafalgar contract was the spark
which ignited the war, there is plenty of powder beneath it. At its heart is
the future of the entire British defence industry.
Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has long harboured an ambition to
merge BAe's defence interests with GEC: an ambition that has grown with the
decline in defence spending since the end of the cold war.
As BAe has recovered from the disasters which struck it in the early 1990s,
however, it has become less enthusiastic about a merger with GEC.
One executive says: 'All the experience suggests that the stronger BAe gets,
the less likely it is to deal with GEC.'
If BAe had bought VSEL unhindered, it would have strengthened its finances,
as well as securing its position as the unchallenged defence prime
contractor in the UK. Improved finances would have given BAe the financial
headroom to rationalise its civil aircraft division - its one remaining
running sore.
Talks are well advanced on a deal which could solve BAe's commercial
aircraft problems through merging BAe's turboprop aircraft business with the
Franco-Italian group ATR. BAe could still do such a deal if it failed to buy
VSEL, but it would be much more of a financial struggle.
Concerns about the size of BAe's civil aircraft liabilities have prevented
GEC from making a hostile bid for the company. GEC's tactics have been to
encourage talks about a friendly merger of the low-risk defence operation,
leaving BAe to handle its civil problems.
By counter-attacking against BAe's bid for VSEL, Lord Weinstock hits two
objectives at once; if he wins he effectively ties up the Trafalgar order,
and leaves BAe weaker and therefore more pliable.
However, the strategy could backfire. The BAe board recognises that there
would be some benefits from a link to GEC; there were abortive talks between
the two companies on the subject last year. The directors' preferred
strategy, however, is to deepen their ties to European aerospace companies,
something which would be more difficult if Dassault or Aerospatiale were
faced with a monolithic GEC/BAe combination. Unfortunately, political
constraints currently make European ties difficult, and BAe has thus been
reluctant finally to close the door on GEC.
But GEC's aggressive tactics over VSEL risk alienating some BAe board
members who might have supported a merger. 'I begin to wonder whether you
can do business with Lord Weinstock,' says one BAe board member. 'Everything
seems to be on his terms or not at all.'
Lord Weinstock's personality is important in another way. In July GEC
announced that the company had asked Lord Weinstock to stay on for two years
past the normal director's retirement date, until he is 72. The assumption
is that his successor will be chosen before July 1996. That gives Lord
Weinstock a very short time in which to realise his ambition of
consolidating the UK defence industry. Hence perhaps his insistence on
moving on VSEL now: if BAe secures the yard it may put the company out of
his reach in the short term.
The VSEL bid is a lower risk strategy than an aggressive bid for all of BAe.
'The fear for Lord Weinstock must be that the liabilities at BAe are bigger
than he imagines.' says one City observer. 'If he mounted an aggressive bid
which went wrong, the deal which was supposed to be his crowning achievement
could end up as the huge blot at the very end of his copybook.'
But the Pounds 14 a share offer is curiously pitched. It is not the knockout
blow of over Pounds 15 which BAe could not hope to match, nor is it a
nominal bid of Pounds 13.50 in line with the BAe offer. 'It may be that Lord
Weinstock is exercising his usual caution and offering the minimum he thinks
necessary to win,' muses one defence executive, 'but I think this suggests
that GEC has not secured all of the competition clearances it needs from the
ministry of defence. For that reason he has mounted a reasonable but not
decisive attack, from which he could withdraw.'
Because GEC's financial position is so much stronger than BAe's, GEC would
win in a straight financial fight. BAe thus has to rely on arguments about
competition in the defence industry to stop GEC. BAe has no shipyard and
thus has little worry on competition grounds, but GEC owns Yarrow on the
Clyde, the only other large warship yard left in the UK.
The Office of Fair Trading will debate the competition concerns, though in
practice, since the MoD is the only buyer, its submissions to the OFT will
decide the issue. If the MoD does not want GEC to own Barrow, the deal will
be blocked; if it is happy, the deal will go ahead.
'I detect a slippage in the MoD's robust position on competition' said one
executive close to the deals. 'Three weeks ago the MoD was very opposed to
both yards being owned by GEC, now it is equivocal. There is a danger that
competition policy in defence procurement is being made on the hoof here.
With the situation in the global defence industry evolving rapidly, that
must be a bad thing. We need a proper review of what UK policy is and how
the European industry can be rationalised effectively. As of now, none of us
knows where we stand.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Competition conundrum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When speculation started over whether there would be a bid battle for VSEL,
a senior Ministry of Defence official was asked what his attitude would be
to offers from BAe and GEC. 'I don't think that we would have any problem
with BAe buying the company,' he said. 'It would be good for competition. It
would give us two strong competitors each owning warship yards.' When GEC
was mentioned, however, he shook his head: 'I don't think it's on.'
A month is a long time in Ministry of Defence policy planning. In the two
weeks since it registered an interest in VSEL, GEC has mounted an effective
campaign in Whitehall to make its bid acceptable. Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, yesterday made the first move in clearing the way for the
GEC bid by saying that the government would not use its 'golden share' - its
right to prevent any company owning more than 15 per cent of VSEL shares -
to block GEC's bid.
The issue will now pass to the Office of Fair Trading. Sir Brian Carsberg,
OFT director-general, must decide whether GEC's ownership of the two largest
warship yards in the UK, Yarrow on the Clyde and Barrow in Cumbria, would
present competition worries. In practice, the ministry will determine the
issue since it is the only UK customer and its submission to the OFT will be
decisive.
BAe's argument is that if it takes over VSEL, there would be two competitive
UK yards able to bid for naval work, each owned by different companies.
'There are no competition issues in our bid and we expect it to be cleared,'
said Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive yesterday. 'But GEC's bid raises
competition issues and I would expect it to be blocked. It runs counter to
the MoD's policy.'
GEC's case is that in practice competition difficulties do not arise.
Trafalgar submarines, for instance, could only be built at Barrow, so
whoever owns that yard will secure the contract even if the MoD invites bids
for the work. The only other contracts available are for the last batch of
Type-23 frigates, for which the prices are well defined. Only after 2000
would there be a potential problem over the next generation frigate called
Horizon; as an Anglo-French joint project, there would be potential
competition from French yards.
Whatever the merits of the two views, the VSEL bids highlight areas of
uncertainty over MoD competition policy. The UK accepts a single
manufacturer of aircraft because costs are prohibitive. But it is far from
clear that costs are a problem in warship yards.
'The real issue is, why should we reduce competition before we have to?'
said a defence executive yesterday. 'If the MoD allows a monopoly in
shipbuilding, it has a lot of explaining to do about how this fits its
policy of competition.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Greenspan in China
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jiang Zemin, the Chinese president, had plenty to learn this week from
the visiting chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr Alan Greenspan. But one
lesson of the market applies as much to recent experience in the US as it
does to China. Capitalism can allow a large economy to grow faster, but it
will rarely allow deep structural weaknesses to go unexposed.
One thing Mr Greenspan shares with his hosts is a penchant for gradualism
or, as they say in Beijing, 'crossing the river by feeling the stones'. For
China, this has meant 15 years of incremental reforms. For Mr Greenspan, it
has meant a career as Federal Reserve chairman in which the interest rate on
federal funds has never changed by more than half a percentage point at a
time.
Since February, he has applied this strategy to slowing growth in the US,
just as he did to reviving it during the recession. A series of five rate
rises has left the interest rate at 4.75 per cent, 1 3/4 percentage points
higher than it was at the start of the year.
One does not have to have a communist's scepticism of markets to favour
incrementalism. Monetary policy is a more established art in the US than it
is in China, but the precise effect of a given change, not to mention the
lag with which it will operate, are uncertain nonetheless. Mr Greenspan
would like a soft landing for the economy and considers a gentle tightening
of monetary policy to be more consistent with this goal than a more dramatic
correction.
The trouble with gradualism, as the Chinese have discovered, is that
economies do not always play by the rules. Data released yesterday showed US
real GDP growing at a rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter of 1994.
This is down on the previous quarter's 4.1 per cent rise, but is still
significantly higher than the 2.5 per cent that Mr Greenspan thinks
consistent with stable prices.
High yield
Over the past few decades, the real rate on federal funds has averaged 2 per
cent, a little more than its current level. Investors fear that this is
altogether too relaxed for an economy half-way through its fourth year of
recovery. That anxiety continues to translate into rising long-term interest
rates. The yield on long-term US treasury bonds is now over 8 per cent, its
highest level since May 1992.
Are these concerns justified? It is in the nature of monetary policy that no
one will know whether Mr Greenspan is making a mistake until it is too late
to correct it. The evidence suggests several developments that could fuel
inflation, but only anecdotal evidence that they are yet doing so.
In the past, commodity prices, high rates of industrial capacity
utilisation, tight labour markets and a falling dollar have individually
proved capable of triggering inflation. In 1994, US producers have had all
four to deal with. The fear is that that sooner, rather than later, they
will raise prices to compensate.
Subdued picture
It has not happened yet. The latest price data showed a subdued picture.
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 2.9 per cent in September, and the
equivalent figure for producer prices was only 1.9 per cent. The labour
market evidence is similarly ambiguous. Hiring, especially in the service
sector, continues apace. But so far there is little sign that wages are
starting to rise in step. Indeed, on Wednesday the labour department
revealed that worker compensation rose 3.2 per cent in the year to
September, the lowest year-on-year increase since the series began in 1981.
Mr Greenspan may wish to ponder the data further before announcing another
rate rise. The political climate in the run-up to the November election is
unusually mean this year. The Fed chairman would rather not be the butt of
the administration's frustration at widely expected Democratic losses.
The trouble is that international investors see things more starkly than Mr
Greenspan and, unlike him, they are not in a mood to be accommodating.
Without an un-Greenspan-like rise in interest rates - perhaps even with such
an increase - the markets' doubts are likely to keep the dollar heading
down, and bond yields heading up.
Investors may find fault with Mr Greenspan's self-restraint over interest
rate rises. But they are also exacting a penalty for the things about the US
which even a more aggressive central banker could do little to alter. The US
had a Dollars 203bn federal deficit in fiscal year 1994, and low savings to
compensate for that built-in profligacy. The result is a current account
deficit which can only be funded by persuading domestic and foreign
investors to buy American assets. Neither category sees many reasons for
doing so.
The US economy, unlike most other industrial countries, is reaching the peak
of the current cycle. From now on the economic news is likely to bring
disappointment to the US people and to Mr Clinton. The argument between Mr
Greenspan and the markets is only over how much disappointment and how fast
it will come.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Tunnel collapse inquiry delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation into the cause of the collapse of a railway tunnel under
construction at London's Heathrow airport could take longer than originally
expected, BAA, the airport operator said yesterday.
News of the delay followed an announcement by the Health and Safety
Executive late on Thursday that it would carry out its own investigation of
the collapse. It plans to publish its findings.
The problems at Heathrow started a week ago when earth began slipping into a
tunnel being excavated using a technique known as the new Austrian
tunnelling method. The tunnel forms part of the Pounds 300m Heathrow express
rail link to Paddington station in London.
BAA said it would take until the end of next week at the earliest before its
own inquiry produced any conclusions. Work on the collapse site, near the
Terminal 3 car park, will remain suspended as will tunnelling using the same
method at two sites on the Jubilee Line extension of the London Underground.
The Health and Safety Executive's investigation will initially look at
whether the Heathrow failure was specific to the site and then consider
whether there are any broader implications for this method of tunnelling.
The Austrian method dispenses with a boring machine and uses an excavator to
create a tunnel with the walls being temporarily reinforced with wire mesh
and concrete. It is normally used to provide short-term support before
construction of the final lining.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Plus signs for negative equity: Alison Smith finds
controversy over the effects of the problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the problem of having a mortgage which is larger than the value of
one's home is still casting a shadow over hundreds of thousands of
households, the gloom that 'negative equity' has shed over the housing
market appears to be lifting somewhat.
Two estimates published this week of the extent of negative equity in the
third quarter of this year, confirmed the fall during the past 12 months.
The Bank of England estimates that 1,096,000 households were in this plight
 -a drop of 16 per cent compared with the final three months of last year.
A separate assessment by the Woolwich building society, the UK's third
largest, put the number of negative equity households at 930,000 - more than
20 per cent lower than the fourth quarter of last year.
The UK's largest mortgage lenders agree that they are pleased to see
negative equity falling, and that it is not the restriction on the housing
market that it was a year or 18 months ago.
Against the background of house prices which are no longer tumbling - even
if the price increases seem small and fragile - opinions are more divided
about how far negative equity is acting as a depressant on the housing
market at its current, lower levels.
Mr Martin Ellis, chief economist at Woolwich, described its impact as
'removing a rung from the housing ladder', and said it must fall further
'before it stops being a problem'.
Many households in that position are those who bought for the first time in
the late 1980s, he said, and who might otherwise be expected to move or to
have moved already.
He also highlighted the constraints on households whose stake in their home
is slightly higher than their mortgage, but which would be eaten up by the
costs of moving.
At the Nationwide build-ing society, Mr David Parry, head of planning, is
more sceptical of the impact of the phenomenon.
'There's no real evidence that negative equity is a brake,' he said. 'The
real motor in the housing market is always the first-time buyers.'
Some economists argue, however, that negative equity has an effect in
deterring first-time buyers in particular.
The Halifax building society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, pointed out
that fear of negative equity from falls in house prices may be a
particularly acute problem for first-time buyers because they are most
likely to be borrowing the highest proportions of the value of their home.
For Abbey National, with its bias in coverage towards the south-east of
England, the gradual reduction in negative equity has been particularly
important: the region was especially hard hit by the fall in house prices.
Even so, Mr Charles Toner, managing director of Abbey's retail operations,
played down the importance of negative equity as a factor, compared with the
impact of the apparent lack of sustained confidence in economic recovery.
'If it halved again in the next year its impact would become marginal,' Mr
Toner said.

FT  29 OCT 94 / RJB to offer miners deal if bid succeeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Budge, the chief executive of RJB Mining, is expected to offer
miners a new three-year contract if his Pounds 900m bid to take over British
Coal's English mines is successful.
Mr Budge says that such a deal would provide greater security for the 7,000
miners he is expected to inherit with the pits. However, another advantage
of the offer is that it would supersede the European Union's acquired rights
directive - known as Tupe - which covers the transfer.
Tupe preserves most aspects of pay conditions - including pensions - and
union recognition when a business is transferred to a new owner. It also
means that any redundancies will attract the British Coal pay-off of up to
Pounds 27,000.
Mr Budge says that he is not worried by Tupe and that it has been taken into
account in his bid price.
Today he will seek to calm anxieties about the transfer before a group of
Union of Democratic Mineworkers officials in Mansfield. He will say that he
has few ambitions to change working practices.
Yet he is known to want to end the incentive bonus scheme which pays a
significant minority of miners up to Pounds 1,000 per week.
Mr Neal Greatrex, leader of the UDM, which was involved in a rival bid,
remains suspicious of Mr Budge: 'He's overstretched himself . . . our legal
advice suggests he won't be able to compensate by reducing wages.'
Other union leaders such as Mr Doug Bulmer, president of BACM, the colliery
managers' unions, are more supportive.

FT  29 OCT 94 / New coal-fired power station on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK coal sales could be given a boost later this decade as a result of
negotiations to build a combined heat and power plant in north-west England,
Michael Smith writes.
The proposed plant for the site of Brunner Mond, the chemicals company, in
Northwich, Cheshire, would use 1m tonnes of coal a year, replacing a
facility that uses just a fifth of that amount.
It would be the first significant coal-fired power station to be built in
several years and would provide a substantial fillip to the coal industry
which has lost out recently to gas in power generation.
Brunner Mond is considering the possibility of a joint venture on the
clean-coal technology project with Manweb, the electricity company, and IVO,
the Finnish power group.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Lottery bets on a hitch in live trials: The build-up to a
network of 10,000 terminals going on-line / The National Lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Lottery comes a step closer today with the first of a series of
'play days' - live dress rehearsals leading up to the launch of the real
thing on November 19.
In more than 10,000 retail outlets in every local authority area in the UK
staff will 'buy' their Pounds 1 tickets, choose six numbers out of 49 and
have them verified by the lottery terminals linked to a complex,
high-security network.
On Tuesday the numbers will be drawn as if for real although the prize will
be a weekend for two in Paris for the retailer who makes fewest mistakes,
rather than what will become the usual Pounds 2m or more jackpot.
The only certainty about the dress rehearsal is that something is bound to
go wrong, Mr David Rigg, communications director of Camelot, the lottery
operator, conceded.
But whatever flaws are found, Camelot has already achieved a great deal  -
operating a live national network for the largest single lottery to be
launched in less than 25 weeks.
Already ICL, a member of the Camelot consortium, has manufactured and
installed the specially designed lottery terminals for the launch.
Peritas, ICL's training subsidiary, will have completed the lottery terminal
training for more than 35,000 people in the space of six weeks. The training
was was carried out at more than 220 locations throughout the UK, usually at
hotels.
It was unable to begin training the targeted three staff from each of the
10,000 or so retailers - which can range from petrol stations and
independent newsagents to J. Sainsbury and Tesco stores - before September
19. There was no point in training people before terminals were installed or
too far before that launch.
'I cannot conceive that anything like it has happened before, not in such a
concentrated period,' said Mr Tim Holley, chief executive of Camelot, who,
like all the 500 Camelot staff, has taken the three-and-a-half-hour course.
'All the Camelot staff are going to be trained. I want them to understand in
responding to retailers exactly what is involved,' Mr Holley added.
Mr Stuart Kearns, Peritas manager of the Camelot training project, looked at
lotteries in other parts of the world before designing the programme. One
key thing to avoid was what happened in the Texas lottery where 28 per cent
of those supposed to come for training were 'no shows'.
This led to the decision to have such a large number of venues around the
country so that no one should have to travel for more than half an hour to
get there.
The course covered everything from an introduction to the lottery and the
five 'good causes' which will benefit - possibly to the extent of Pounds 9bn
over seven years - to how to operate the lottery terminals. There was also a
quiz at the end to check knowledge.
'If people really haven't coped, we take steps to ensure that they really
will be all right,' Mr Holley said.
The training contract will represent a multi-million pound deal for Peritas
by the time the full complement of more than 40,000 retailers have been
trained by the end of 1996.
After the November 19 launch there will be a pause to draw breath before the
programme of installing on-line lottery terminals rolls on. There will be
another pause in the spring when scratch cards will be launched in addition
to the multi-million jackpot draw.
As the final countdown gets under way there was encouraging market research
for Camelot. Thirty per cent of people said they would play the National
Lottery every week and as many as 80 per cent said they would buy tickets
occasionally.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Fixed mortgages lose their appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Borrowers turned away from banks' fixed-rate mortgages to their variable
rate loans in the third quarter, according to figures released yesterday by
the British Bankers' Association.
It said the proportion of mortgages on fixed rates dropped from 73 per cent
in the second quarter to 53 per cent.
In contrast to last summer when banks won significant mortgage business
through fixed rates, which were cheaper than variable rate loans, fixed
rates can now be more expensive than floating-rate mortgages, particularly
those which have heavy discounts in the early years.
The figures underline the shift in market share between banks and building
societies since last year.
Seasonally adjusted figures for new net lending undertaken rose to Pounds
659m last month compared with Pounds 610m in August, but below the Pounds
827m equivalent figure for September last year.
However, the impact of the 0.5 percentage point rise in interest rates last
month is less clear-cut.
Loans approved but not yet undertaken - an important forward-looking
indicator since they translate into lending carried out in the following
weeks - dropped from 31,047 approved in August to 29,718 approved in
September. A similar drop occurred between August and September last year,
but from a higher base.
The association highlighted the fact that banks' gross mortgage lending
totalled Pounds 1.74bn in September - more than 3 per cent higher than in
September last year.

Offer, the electricity regulator, is to ask the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to adjudicate after Scottish Hydro-Electric, the power company,
announced yesterday it was not accepting price controls due to take effect
next April.
It will be the first MMC referral made by Professor Stephen Littlechild,
Offer director-general. ScottishPower yesterday accepted the price controls
and regional power companies in England and Wales have already done so.
The referral results from circumstances unique to Hydro. But analysts said
yesterday that it could have wider implications. Although it is unlikely
that the reviews of the other companies will be re-opened to allow changes,
the MMC may look at how Prof Littlechild reached his conclusions throughout
the sector. 'There is a danger for him that they will say he got it wrong,'
said one analyst.
Hydro's share price was steady yesterday, with most investors taking the
view that it could gain but was unlikely to lose as a result of a review.
The shares are already on the highest yield, and therefore the lowest
rating, in the sector.
The company said it would continue its policy, effective to the end of this
year, of increasing dividends annually by between 6 per cent and 8 per cent
in real terms.
Hydro said yesterday that its prime concern was that Prof Littlechild's
review implied a rate of return for the distribution business which, at 2
per cent, would effectively prevent funding the proper level of maintenance.
All other companies in the sector will enjoy a considerably higher rate of
return following their reviews, with the regional companies on about 7 per
cent and ScottishPower 6 per cent.
Mr Roger Young, Hydro's chief executive, said without a change to the price
controls his company would not be able to invest in its distribution
business. 'If we do not invest then shareholders' assets crumble and the
number of power cuts rises,' he said.
'The acceptance of these proposals would place Hydro in an even more
difficult position at the next price control review in 1999. The regulatory
rules preclude unauthorised cross-subsidy of distribution from other
business activities.'
Hydro said it expected to be able to continue cutting electricity prices
even with 'more appropriate' price controls. It already had among the lowest
domestic prices in Britain.
The company is also challenging the 'Hydro benefit' system which allows the
company to cross-subsidise the transmission and distribution businesses from
generation.
The MMC reference is likely to take at least six months. Offer said it would
hope to announce terms of reference in the next few weeks. Lex, Page 24

FT  29 OCT 94 / Virgin drink risks holy row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Branson provoked a potential holy row yesterday by announcing in
the staunchly Roman Catholic Irish Republic that he planned to launch a
drink next year called Virgin Mary.
The tomato and Tabasco mixer is intended to go with Virgin Vodka, due in the
shops in three weeks, and is part of the continuing programme of launching
drinks to go alongside Virgin Cola.
Mr Branson expressed surprise that using the Virgin name to sell a Virgin
Mary drink might be controversial.
'It never occurred to me,' he said. 'A Virgin Mary is what you call a tomato
and Tabasco drink. I drink it all the time.
He added: 'If we are going to offend people, we will obviously think twice.'
In interviews at the Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin, Mr Branson also
gave a progress report on Virgin Cola. He said there were firm sales already
of 30m cans, with 24m going to the Tesco supermarket group. Mr Branson said
that at a retail price of 25p he expected a 50 per cent market share in
Tesco stores before Christmas.
The Iceland foodstore chain, he said, would replace Pepsi with Virgin Cola
and was likely to give the new brand greater prominence than Coca-Cola. Next
week Virgin will also announce a cola deal with a 1,800-strong off-licence
chain which Mr Branson declined to name. 'By the end of November we will be
in 3,500 stores,' he said.
The Virgin chief added that he planned to launch a range of soft drinks
under the Virgin name, including Virgin Water, orange juice and lemonade.
'The range of drinks that Coke sells we will be selling,' he said.
Mr Branson conceded that the Virgin name had been considered, and rapidly
dropped, for two other company ventures: Mates condoms and a model agency.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Welsh and Scots step up calls for Ulster-style deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is facing growing demands from Welsh and Scottish
nationalists for equal constitutional treatment with Northern Ireland,
including the establishment of devolved assemblies.
Nationalists in both countries see the Ulster peace talks as the trigger for
a campaign to highlight the contradictions between the government's approach
to Northern Ireland and its handling of Scotland and Wales.
Nationalists intend to contrast the government's reluctance to acknowledge
peaceful demands for Scottish and Welsh devolution with its willingness to
negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, if the Northern
Ireland ceasefire holds.
Mr Dafydd Wigley, president of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party,
yesterday stepped up the campaign at the party's conference in Llandudno,
appealing to Mr John Major to recognise that Ulster and Wales have equal
rights to self-determination.
'In the name of democracy, consistency and political justice, I appeal to
the prime minister to recognise the morally indefensible position of denying
these self-same rights to the people of Wales,' he said.
'If John Major can tell the people of the six counties of Northern Ireland
that if it is their wish, democratically expressed, that they can unite with
the Irish Republic . . . by what token can he deny that self-same degree of
sovereignty to the people of Wales and of Scotland?'
The issue was raised in the Commons on Thursday by Mr Alex Salmond, leader
of the Scottish National party, in a barbed intervention at prime minister's
question time.
Congratulating Mr Major on the apparent success of his Northern Ireland
policy, Mr Salmond pointed out that it hinged on the right of the people of
Northern Ireland to determine their own future.
'For the avoidance of any doubt, will you confirm that you also believe in
the right of self-determination for the Scottish nation?' he asked.
Mr Major, who fell back on claims that devolution would raise taxes,
appeared to have no answer to a line of questioning that promises to become
increasingly embarrassing for the government.

The Radio Authority yesterday announced plans for the next batch of
commercial radio licences, including four new regional stations to serve
nearly 7m listeners.
As well as the four new regional FM stations for the Yorkshire area, East

the annual Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin for 20 new licences for
stations that will generally be smaller than existing independent local
radio stations.

Britain outside the European Union would be 'just an irrelevance', Mr Tim
Eggar, energy minister, warned in the Commons yesterday in dismissing
suggestions that withdrawal was a viable option.
He did not dispute assertions by Labour MPs that his words were principally
aimed at Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who recently branded as
'simplistic' those who argue that such a course is unthinkable.
Business leaders believe developments in the EU during the past five years
have helped to increase trade for their companies, says a MORI survey of 101
directors for American Express released yesterday.

The government should be wary of allowing small pension schemes to operate
under a weaker regulatory regime than large ones because small schemes
generally pose the greatest problems, according to the Occupational Pensions
Advisory Service.
Mr Don Hall, chief executive of Opas, a government-funded body which advises
individuals who have concerns about their occupational pensions, said: 'It's
the area of small schemes where historically we have had the most problems.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Miles Young, Westminster City Council leader, yesterday sought to prove
his innocence at the public hearings into gerrymandering allegations.
The council's district auditor, Mr John Magill, ruled in his provisional
report that Mr Young was not 'actively involved' in gerrymandering. But this
finding has been challenged by objectors whose initial complaints prompted
the district auditor's investigation.
Mr Bernard Livesey, QC for Mr Young, said there was no new evidence to make
the district auditor change his mind.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Walker received Pounds 1m in legal aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the leisure entrepreneur cleared of orchestrating a fraud
at Brent Walker, his former company, received more than Pounds 1m in legal
aid it was disclosed yesterday, James Blitz writes.
Mr John Taylor, the parliamentary secretary at the Lord Chancellor's
Department, said Mr Walker, who was acquitted earlier this week, had
received Pounds 1,152,442 to help fight his case.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Taylor said the sum was 'in the form of
discretionary interim payments made in respect of proceedings in the Crown
Court'.
He said it was not possible to estimate, as yet, what the final cost of the
court case would be, although the total sum has been estimated at Pounds 5m.
Mr Walker had been accused of masterminding the fraudulent boost of Brent
Walker's profits by Pounds 19m during the 1980s but was cleared of all
charges of theft, conspiracy and false accounting brought against him by the
Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Taylor also revealed that Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Kevin Maxwell, the sons
of Robert Maxwell, have already received Pounds 400,000 in legal aid
payments to help fight charges arising out of the collapse of their father's
business empire.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Halifax withdraws sales force: Financial services team to be
re-tested after failing to meet regulatory standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax building society, one of the UK's largest personal finance
organisations, is to withdraw its 600-strong financial services sales force
for re-testing, after discovering failures to meet regulators' standards.
The temporary withdrawal is a severe embarrassment to the organisation,
coming just two months before the launch of a wholly owned life insurance
subsidiary, Halifax Life.
Halifax said yesterday that the compliance failures revealed by its internal
checks related to 'observed interviews' which sales agents perform as part
of their continuous training, and there was no evidence that any customer
had been given poor advice or had suffered.
While most of the irregularities were minor - such as an intervention in an
interview by an observer who should have remained silent - some more serious
matters - including failures to carry out the observed interview at all -
had involved 'a handful' of the sales force.
Mr James Crosby, general manager of financial services at Halifax, said
yesterday: 'It is disappointing that a minority of our advisers have not
followed the required procedures. We have a comprehensive action plan in
hand to ensure that these incidents do not recur and that all our advisers
measure up to the high standards we have set ourselves.'
Even so, the move is awkward for the society as it prepares for its own life
subsidiary, particularly as earlier this year Mr Mike Blackburn, chief
executive, set the society the specific aim of being 'the biggest and best
personal finance business in the UK'.
Halifax's approach to setting up the life operation has been marked by a
desire to see its strong brand image as a mortgage lender extended to the
new business, partly by exercising strict control over the products and
services offered.
The re-testing process is due to take two to three weeks. The sales agents
who pass - which Halifax expects to be the vast majority - will then be able
to go back to giving financial advice for mortgage-related products.
At the same time they will receive detailed training on Halifax Life
products as the society had intended they should in December anyway. They
will not return to more general financial planning advice until the new
operation opens for business.
Yesterday's announcement does not affect the 2,000-plus Halifax branch staff
who can advise on endowment mortgages but not on the full range of financial
services.
Halifax is not the first large financial organisation to have to undertake a
high-profile withdrawal of its sales force this year. Norwich Union, the
insurer, and Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, have both
had to announce temporary suspensions of financial services sales staff for
re-training.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Islands top list of best-value schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In education, the best value for money seems to lie offshore.
A rough analysis of the value for money which independent schools offer,
based on the FT-1,000 ranking of their A-level results published today in
the Financial Times, shows that the top two day schools in the British Isles
are both in the Channel Islands.
Guernsey Ladies' College charges Pounds 675 a term, compared with an average
for the UK of Pounds 1,372, while Victoria College, Jersey, charges Pounds
559.
Among boarding schools, the best value is St Mary's, in Shaftesbury, Dorset.
Girls' boarding schools performed well, accounting for all top four places.
But prestigious boys' schools still ranked highly, even after their fees
were taken into account, with Eton offering best value among boys' boarding
schools.
The list of day schools includes several big-city independent grammar
schools, such as Withington Girls' School, Manchester Grammar, and King
Edward VI girls' school in Birmingham.
The rankings take no account of the degree to which schools select their
entry, or of extra-curricular activities. Value-for-money rankings were
derived by dividing schools' A-level scores by their fees. This favours
selective academic schools, and those listed here do not necessarily offer
best value for children not academically gifted.
The value-for-money table is printed below. The figures in brackets are the
school's place in the FT-1,000 A-level ranking and the fees per term.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Dublin forum has shaky start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New signs of strain between London and Dublin emerged yesterday over a
framework document for Northern Ireland as Irish prime minister Mr Albert
Reynolds outlined his hopes for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.
Mr Reynolds was clearly disappointed at the decision of the British
ambassador Mr David Blatherwick not to attend on the opening day.
Downing Street said the ambassador declined because of the presence of Sinn
Fein, with which London has not entered into exploratory talks.
Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, described the
British move as petty: 'It's an indication of the British attitude not just
to the peace process, but also to the Irish government.'
In another remark unlikely to comfort London, Mr Reynolds appeared to link
the issue of the 'disposal of arms' with a British decision to withdraw
'troops to barracks'.
The forum gathering in Dublin Castle comprised leaders of the constitutional
parties of the south, together with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party of Northern
Ireland.
Mr Reynolds said the forum would 'establish for the first time . . . some
measure of agreement on future structures governing relationships within
Northern Ireland, between north and south and between Ireland and Britain'.
This referred to the three strands of the Anglo-Irish talks. Mr Reynolds
also held out the prospect of a debate on constitutional change, as
foreshadowed in the Downing Street declaration.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Major snaps over tittle-tattle: Rumbold explains resignation
and hits back at 'witch-hunt'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major angrily rejected allegations of ministerial impropriety
yesterday and promised full co-operation with the director of public
prosecutions' inquiries into claims that Mr Mohamed Fayed - the owner of
Harrods - tried to blackmail the government.
Clearly annoyed by a fresh controversy over the resignation from a lobbying
firm of Dame Angela Rumbold, a Conservative party deputy chairman, Mr Major
rebuked reporters who questioned him about her position during a visit to
Wales. 'If you want to know about Angela's position, then you had better ask
Angela,' he said. 'It is not a matter for me. I am not responsible for the
headlines. I am not responsible for tittle-tattle.'
Mr Major's outburst suggested that the strain of dealing with a week-long
onslaught of allegations against ministers was taking its toll.
But there was no sign of an end to the stream of accusations from opposition
MPs.
Dame Angela, MP for Mitcham and Morden, said she resigned as a director of
Decision Makers to prevent the firm being 'dragged into some kind of
unpleasant dogfight with the press'.
Dame Angela, who had registered her interest in the firm, said the 'campaign
of innuendo' against the government 'is becoming a quite unpleasant
witch-hunt'.
Labour claimed she had offered an 'inside track' to the company during its
successful campaign to have a station on the proposed Channel tunnel
high-speed rail line sited at a site owned by Blue Circle at Ebbsfleet,
Kent.
Mr Michel Meacher, shadow transport secretary, accused Dame Angela of
'hiring out her position and contacts' to businesses.
Downing Street said Mr Major took no part in the Ebbsfleet decision. He met
the Ebbsfleet campaigners only once, by accident at a social engagement. The
Department of Transport said Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary,
had never met them.
Mr John McGregor, transport secretary until July, was also said to have had
no official meetings with the campaigners - but they did meet Mr Roger
Freeman, then transport minister of state.
Mr Major, who had hoped that his announcement of a standing committee
chaired by Lord Nolan would stop the allegations of 'sleaze', said he would
speak to the DPP about the blackmail allegations.
Interviewed before his trip to Wales, Mr Major insisted: 'Nobody, whatever
position they may hold, is above the law in this country.' He said he would
also give evidence to the Nolan committee if it wished.
Labour will table a Commons resolution on Monday requiring the privileges
committee to sit mainly in public to hear allegations that two Conservative
MPs were willing to take cash for tabling parliamentary questions.
Meanwhile, a Harris poll for ITN suggested that 66 per cent of people think
MPs' standards have declined since 1979, and 85 per cent think MPs should
not receive money from lobbyists.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Conservatives put on a brave face over 'sleaze'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conservative MPs escaped to their constituencies from the hothouse of
Westminster yesterday hoping desperately that the steady drip of 'sleaze'
allegations against the government has been staunched.
Publicly, they were putting on a brave face, arguing that with 2 1/2 years
to go before the next general election, the government has plenty of time to
recover its lost popularity.
Many offered a parallel with the Westland affair in 1985-86, which came
close to bring-ing down the government, but was followed by Baroness
Thatcher's overwhelming victory in the 1987 general election.
MPs from both sides of the party dismissed most of the allegations as either
trivial or unfounded, but there were sharp differences on Mr John Major's
handling of the affair.
Most mainstream MPs believe the prime minister coped reasonably well in
trying circumstances. Many were pleased by his fighting performance at prime
minister's question time on Thursday, when he angrily dismissed Labour
probing.
But right-wingers were largely dismissive, claiming that the prime minister
had displayed weakness and disloyalty, especially to Mr Neil Hamilton, the
corporate affairs minister who resigned earlier this week.
'The problem is that his decision to sack Neil, even though the allegations
against him were unfounded, has left every minister open to challenge. We
just don't know who's next,' said one.
The right was also angry with newspaper reporting of the events of the week,
claiming that trivial and unsubstantiated allegations had been unfairly
exploited to embarrass ministers.
'I've been told that newspapers have four more names which are going to be
released at the rate of one a month,' a senior rightwing backbencher claimed
confidentially.
Conspiracy fantasies aside, the party has clearly been deeply wounded by the
controversy. 'It is devastating us,' a senior member of the 1922 committee
of backbenchers admitted.
'We are just hoping it will go away. But the real danger is that there will
be more (allegations). If that happens we are in real trouble,' he said.
Another backbencher, fiercely loyal to the prime minister, argued that he
had laid the groundwork for a government fightback by setting up the
standing committee on public standards, to be chaired by Lord Nolan.
But she admitted: 'All this is hurting us a lot. It has lowered our morale.
We were already unpopular because of the recession; now people think we are
crooked as well as incompetent.'
In a sign of the times, departing MPs of all parties rushed to comply with
Commons rules that payments and overseas visits must be entered in the
Commons register of interests within four weeks.
Scrutiny of the register revealed a number of oversights by MPs on both
sides, notably by Mr Bernie Grant, Labour MP for Tottenham, who added seven
free or subsidised overseas trips to his previous declaration.
'It's crazy really,' said one MP. 'Many of these things are pretty minor,
and this is the first chance most people have had to register things since
the summer break. But in the current climate everyone has to be squeaky
clean.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Nolan committee to meet next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The committee headed by Lord Nolan set up to examine standards of conduct in
public life is to hold its first meeting next week.
This underlines the speed with which the prime minister wishes to calm
concerns of sleaze hanging over his government.
Lord Nolan has told Whitehall officials that he wants to hold most of the
committee's hearings in public. But he has also given an assurance that he
will abide by the remit set by Mr John Major, and will avoid investigating
specific allegations of impropriety against Tory MPs.
The committee's eight men and two women will include Sir Martin Jacomb,
chairman of the British Council, Sir Clifford Boulton, the former clerk of
the Commons, and Dame Anne Warburton, former president of Lucy Cavendish
College, Cambridge.
One member said the task of examining whether standards of conduct for
public servants should be tightened would be hard to achieve.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Ex-banker aims to lift Tory funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party has appointed a former investment banker as its new
head of fundraising in a fresh attempt to cut its Pounds 15m overdraft by
attracting more company donations.
Mr Richard Warner, who until the early 1990s worked for Morgan Grenfell, the
merchant bank, will have as one of his main responsibilities contacting
company chairmen who have been reluctant to donate to the Tories.
His appointment marks a break in tradition at Conservative Central Office
since for the past 24 years this role has been undertaken by retired
generals.
One of Mr Warner's tasks will be to increase annual donations to the party
from individuals and companies from Pounds 9.4m in 1993-94. It is believed
that the Conservatives want this to increase to at least Pounds 20m by the
time of the next general election, likely to be in about two years.
Over this period the Tories want to cut the overdraft, which came about
after high spending in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to about zero.
In the past two years total donations - believed to be split roughly evenly
between companies and individuals - have slipped. Several big companies have
cut cash gifts either because of disillusionment with the effectiveness of
donations, or because of reduced profits in the recession.
Mr Warner, 55, said he wanted people to feel proud of giving money to the
Tories. He took over last week from Maj Gen Stuart Watson. Mr Warner, a
chemical engineer who first worked at Imperial Chemical Industries, worked
for Morgan Grenfell for more than a decade. In his new job, he will liaise
with the party's board of part-time treasurers, led by Lord Hambro, chairman
of Hambros merchant bank.

<TEXT>
Mr Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP, has complained to the Institute of
Chartered Accountants about the auditing of the Conservative party's
accounts, Jim Kelly writes.
Mr Mitchell has written to Mr Andrew Colquhoun, institute president,
alleging that the audit by Coopers &amp; Lybrand for the 1993-94 accounts is
deficient. He says the absence of information about the source of donations
amounting to Pounds 9.4m undermines the ability of the accounts to provide a
'true and fair view'.
Mr Paul Judge, director-general of Conservative Central Office, said Coopers
&amp; Lybrand is one of the most reputable firms in the world.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it could not comment on the case of a client.

Mr Andrei Vavilov, the Russian temporary acting finance minister, said
yesterday that 'we have a lot of work to do with the state duma on the
budget' - an admission of the difficulties the finance ministry foresees in
getting agreement on a budget which will further squeeze the Russian economy
in an effort to bring inflation down. However, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, press
secretary to President Boris Yeltsin, said yesterday the failure of a motion
of no confidence on Thursday in the lower house would 'ease political
tension and avoid a government crisis.' Mr Kostikov said reforms would get
tougher - 'it's clear the government won the battle for the budget and in a
larger sense for reform'.

Mr Alain Carignon, the former French communications minister who resigned in
July following a corruption scandal, faces continued detention in a Lyon
prison after his appeal was rejected yesterday. Mr Henri Blondet, the
presiding judge, said there was 'serious, detailed, and corroborated
evidence' against the former minister, who is charged with accepting gifts
from business groups and arranging the rescue of his indebted campaign
newspaper by a utilities company. In return, it is alleged that a water
privatisation contract in the city of Grenoble, where Mr Carignon is mayor,
was awarded to the utilities company. The Carignon investigation is one of a
series of corruption probes which have rocked the centre-right government of
prime minister Edouard Balladur and French business this year.

Vox, the ailing German private television station, yesterday cleared another
hurdle on its way to recovery when four state television authorities
approved the channel's new shareholder structure. However, final approval
rests with the remaining 12 state television authorities who still have not
agreed to the new ownership. Vox, based in Cologne, was launched at the
beginning of 1993 but failed to attract viewers because of an unattractive
programme mix. The six original shareholders fell out and the channel went
into liquidation on April 1. After months of negotiations with Bertelsmann,
the German media group which has been the driving force behind Vox, Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation took a 49.9 per cent stake in the station
in early July. Bertelsmann holds 24.9 per cent and Canal Plus, the French
station, holds a further 24.9 per cent.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Clinton reassures Kuwait over Iraq
</HEADLINE>

   By Our Middle East Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton left Saudi Arabia at the end of a Middle East tour
yesterday, having reassured Kuwait that Iraq would never again be allowed to
threaten its security, writes our Middle East staff.
'The United States and the international community will not allow Baghdad to
threaten its neighbour, now or in the future,' he said earlier in a brief
visit to Kuwait.
'That is not a threat. That is a promise,' he told an audience of US troops
who had been rushed to the emirate following Iraq's military build-up on the
border earlier this month.
Flanked by tanks and infantry fighting vehicles, Mr Clinton told hundreds of
US, British, Kuwaiti and other Gulf Arab troops: 'We will not permit Iraq to
enhance its capability below the 32nd parallel,' the line below which Iraq
is barred from flying its warplanes.
Mr Clinton was greeted with placards proclaiming 'Thank you, Mr President,'
and 'Welcome, Mr President.'
Washington announced on the eve of Mr Clinton's arrival in Kuwait that it
was doubling its deployment of armour and attack jets in the Gulf to deter
any military threat from Iraq.
Mr Clinton's final stop on his six-nation tour was at the northern Saudi
military city of Hafr al-Batin where he met King Fahd before flying back to
Washington.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Beating Mideast swords into ploughshares: The peace summit
in Casablanca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seven heads of government, 50 foreign ministers and more than 1,000 senior
business executives from 60 countries began gathering in Casablanca
yesterday for a three-day summit aimed at transforming the region's peace
agreements into fuller economic integration.
Organisers of the most ambitious political and business networking session
ever undertaken for the Middle East hope it will encourage a new partnership
between the private and public sectors, new financing structures, including
a Dollars 10bn capitalised regional development bank, and solid moves
towards realising hundreds of development projects.
Mr Klaus Schwab, president of the World Economic Forum, the Swiss-based
think tank which jointly arranged the conference with the independent US
Council on Foreign Relations, likened the meeting to the pioneering steps
taken in the late 1950s which created today's European Union.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, the most outspoken advocate of
Middle East economic integration, has called the conference a 'battle cry'
for regional co-operation.
'Israel and many Arab countries are facing a new danger,' he said, 'one that
cannot be fought by conventional means of guns or tanks: the spread of
extreme movements. What fuels these movements is poverty, starvation and
unemployment ..the answer must be economic.'
Not everyone in the region shares Mr Peres' optimism. Syria and Lebanon are
boycotting the summit and neither is prepared to join any multilateral talks
including Israel until a full Syrian-Israeli peace is agreed.
Some Arab officials taking part have also voiced scepticism at the scale of
the conference's ambitions.
Israel has submitted a detailed list of projects worth up to Dollars 27bn
over 10 years.
Some are immediately practicable: like linking electricity grids; water
conservation and desalination plants; regional agriculture research and
development; shared use of ports and airports and the development of huge
tourism centres.
Others will require more time and political will, like a Beirut-Tel
Aviv-Cairo-East Mediterranean coastal motorway, gas and oil pipelines from
the Gulf to Israel's Mediterranean ports and plans to buy water from Turkey.
Israel and Jordan, the two countries most enthusiastic and perhaps best
prepared for economic integration, will jointly present plans developed in a
trilateral economic commission with the US for the cross-border development
of the valley which divides the two states.
Jordan, whose delegation will be headed by Crown Prince Hassan, also hopes
to create a permanent process from Casablanca. 'We're already discussing a
sequel to it in Amman in the spring and are hoping to create a permanent
secretariat,' said Mr Ahmed Mango, the Crown Prince's economic adviser.
Mr Peres has promoted the creation of a Middle East development bank, with
initial capital of Dollars 10bn. Modelled on the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, it would principally make capital
investments and long-term loans to finance regional infrastructure projects,
provide technical assistance for projects and raise money on international
capital markets. The new bank would also create a Middle East OECD as a
forum for regional economic policy.
Israel also hopes in Casablanca to get western governments to commit
themselves to an expanded programme of government guarantees, political risk
insurance and export financing for regional projects.
But the summit's most enthusiastic proponents believe the core task will be
to bring the private sector more solidly into the development of a region
which, among Arab states notably, has lain overwhelmingly and often
inefficiently in state hands.
Israeli companies alone are expected to present proposals for Dollars 100m
in joint ventures.
There has been no shortage of interest from outside the region with an
estimated 1,100 business executives descending on the Moroccan city this
weekend.

<BYLINE>

   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, yesterday unveiled a
moderately expansionist budget for 1995 aimed at sustaining the country's
economic growth while also controlling inflation.
Mr Anwar forecast that Malaysia's economy would grow by 8.5 per cent this
year, the seventh consecutive year of growth exceeding 8 per cent. 'While
others are plodding along painfully, we are riding the waves of rapid
economic growth,' he said.
He proposed a series of tax cuts which would primarily benefit lower income
groups - and win support for the government of prime minister Dr Mahathir
Mohamad in advance of elections likely to be held later this year or early
next. The maximum rate of individual income tax will be cut from 34 to 32
per cent while income tax will be abolished for a large segment of those on
lower incomes.
'Thirty per cent of the total number of taxpayers will no longer have to pay
income tax,' said Mr Anwar.
Corporate tax will be cut by 2 per cent to 30 per cent in line with other
countries in the region. Mr Anwar said the government intended to further
streamline investment procedures and announced a number of measures to
encourage domestic investment.
The government says the inflation rate is 3.7 per cent. As part of the
effort to overcome market imperfections and stabilise prices, import duties
on more than 2,600 items - many of them foodstuffs - will be either reduced
or abolished.
Due to a rapid growth in imports so far this year and a sharp rise in the
deficit on the services account, Malaysia's current account balance of
payments deficit is forecast to balloon to MDollars 11.7bn (Dollars 4.8bn),
compared with an earlier official projection of a surplus of MDollars 1.5bn.
Measures to tackle the services deficit include increasing efficiency and
capacity at ports and promoting the development of the Malaysian shipping
industry.
Mr Anwar also announced a substantial increase in educational spending in
order to meet serious skills shortages. He warned that wages in the first
seven months of this year wages had risen by 6.7 per cent, compared with an
increase in productivity of 2.2 per cent.
'While we may rightly rejoice in our success, let us not throw caution to
the wind,' he said.

Russia worth Dollars 160m which the ministry says will 'close the debt issue
with Russia'. At the last count Poland owed Russia Dollars 2.3bn and 5.2bn

Macedonia's nationalist opposition parties have called for a boycott of
tomorrow's second round of parliamentary elections, accusing the government
of electoral fraud in the first-round vote two weeks ago. Both the hardline
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement (VMRO), which lost support in the
first round, and the newly founded Democratic Party are pressing for new
elections. International monitors have said fraud was not widespread, but
the official electoral commission admitted that 10 per cent of Macedonia's
1.3m voters were not included in constituency registers but said they would
still be able to cast ballots.
President Kiro Gligorov, comfortably re-elected in the first-round ballot,
appealed to voters to participate, saying the former Yugoslav republic's
record of a smooth transition to democracy was at stake. The former
communist Alliance for Macedonia, backed by Mr Gligorov, said it won 32.1
per cent of the first-round vote compared with 14.4 per cent for VMRO and
11.2 per cent for the Democratic Party.

The South Korean cabinet yesterday survived a no-confidence motion in
parliament that had been tabled by the opposition to protest at the
government's alleged mismanagement in connection with the collapse of a
Seoul bridge last week. The accident, which killed 32 peeple, is blamed on
poor maintenance of the 15-year-old bridge. The parliament supported Prime
Minister Lee Yung-dug by a vote of 174 to 116. The result had been expected
since the ruling Democratic Liberal party controls 177 seats in the

The Kenyan shilling plunged against the dollar yesterday by more than 20 per
cent in panic selling caused by the liberalisation of the oil industry,
Several banks, including Barclays, Standard Chartered and Citibank, quoted
the shilling at an average of 43.83 against the dollar, down from 35.48 on
Thursday. The liberalisation from midnight on Thursday and expectations of
it on Wednesday created an instant demand for dollars as oil companies moved
to build up their oil stocks. 'The rush by some oil companies and
manufacturers ..to finance stocks for the next three months or so has
resulted in an excessive demand for dollars, causing the exchange rate to
depreciate,' said Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor. He said the
panic buying of dollars was unjustified as his bank held hard currency
reserves in excess of Dollars 800m, 'sufficient to meet the country's import
requirements for the next six months'.

<TEXT>
A new international treaty to simplify protection of trademarks was signed
in Geneva yesterday after five years of negotiation involving nearly 100
countries. The Trademark Law Treaty, negotiated under the auspices of the
World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo), will make it easier for
companies to register trademarks, including service marks, in their home
countries and internationally. It will come into force three months after a
minimum of five countries have formally ratified it.
Some 300,000 registered trademarks used internationally are lodged with
Wipo, but the total registered worldwide with national trademark authorities
is put at 7m. The new treaty lays down common procedures for national
trademark registration, cuts down on red tape, harmonises the duration of
initial and renewal registration to ten years and gives service marks the
same legal status as trademarks.
Among 35 states which signed the treaty yesterday were the US, Russia,
China, six European Union members including Britain, several east European
nations and a number of developing countries.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Renamo drops Mozambique election boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique's first multi-party elections were back on course last night
after Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the country's former rebel movement,
reversed his eve of poll decision to stage a boycott.
The Renamo leader changed his mind under intense pressure from the United
Nations, western countries that have helped fund the elections, and from
neighbouring states, including South Africa.
It would have been made clear to him that he could expect no sympathy from
either regional or international governments, and Mr Dhlakama may well have
been warned that the frontline group of southern African states were
prepared to offer military assistance to the newly elected government of
Mozambique should Renamo resume its guerrilla war.
'The fact that Zimbabwe had committed troops (to Mozambique) in the past was
a strong incentive to Dhlakama to sit up and take notice,' said Mr Greg
Mills, director of studies at the South African Institute for International
Affairs.
He said the sending by South Africa of Deputy President Thabo Mbkei and
Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, with the blessing of other regional
states, to pressure Mr Dhlakama had shown the Renamo leader the depth of
anger at the boycott, which had threatened to unhinge years of work to
restore peace in the impoverished country.
The boycott decision, said Mr Mills, announced only hours before polling
began on Thursday, highlighted a deep split within Renamo, which fought a
16-year war against Mozambique's formerly Marxist rulers of President
Joaquim Chissano's Frelimo party.
'There is a very big split within the (Renamo) party, with Dhlakama and his
advisers on the one side and a large number of party officials who realised
Renamo had very little option,' said Mr Mills.
Mr Dhlakama changed his mind after negotiating through the night and morning
with officials from the United Nations, western embassies and the National
Election Commission. He declined to answer questions about his volte face.
The Commission extended the country's two-day presidential and parliamentary
elections and voting will continue today. Mozambicans and African leaders
had feared the Renamo boycott could lead to a renewal of the civil war which
ended with a peace accord between Renamo and Frelimo two years ago.
'A shadow has been lifted with Dhlakama's decision,' the United Nations
special envoy to Mozambique, Mr Aldo Ajello, said.
Mr Ajello, in charge of the 7,000 strong UN peacekeeping force, said his
impression was that the election had gone well so far.
President Chissano, widely expected to be returned to the presidency and
capture a majorty of the 250 parliamentary seats at stake, welcomed the
decision: 'This is what all of us wanted,' he said.
There remain doubts, however, about the Renamo leader's intentions, and many
observers do not rule out the possibility that Mr Dhlakama will cry foul
when the reults are declared.
Final results are not expected until mid-November. Mr There are 12
presidential contenders and 14 political groups vying for a place in the
assembly.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Invasion fever grips Taiwan: A book ignites fears China may
send in troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inauspicious celestial patterns and China's desire to reclaim the island of
Taiwan have combined in a newly published best-seller to prompt the most
severe bout of invasion fever to afflict the Taiwanese since the early
1980s.
Entitled 'T-Day August 1995: The Warning of the Taiwan Strait War,' the book
constructs in blunt terms an elaborate scenario whereby China retakes the
island while the world stands by.
According to the Book, on T-Day an attack will be led by elite paratroops,
who will land on the golf courses ringing the otherwise cluttered capital of
Taipei.
Improbable? Yes. Impossible? Not necessarily.
China refuses to renounce the use of force to retake Taiwan and frequently
reiterates its claim to sovereignty over the island. Ominous warnings from
Beijing about military intervention have accompanied the growth of a
Taiwanese independence movement, which does not want to be 'reunited with
the motherland', as China puts it.
Critics dismiss the book as politically motivated scaremongering. They
charge that its publication in August was backed by right-wing elements in
the ruling Kuomintang party and timed to dissuade Taiwan's middle-class from
The cover of the book warning of an invasion by China
voting for pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party candidates in key
December elections.
But Taiwanese are genuinely concerned, as evidenced by a sharp rise in
inquiries over emigration to western countries. And the hold over the
Taiwanese imagination of all things superstitious cannot be underestimated.
According to the lunar calendar, next year will have an extra eighth month.
Chinese believe that the insertion of a month portends either blessing or
calamity, usually the latter. Previous leap-months coincided with the
invasion of China by western powers in 1900, a bloody purge in China in
1956-57, and struggles following Mao's death in 1976.
'In Chinese history, the reason for starting a war is always face, not
economic advantage,' said Mr James Chin, publisher of Business Weekly
magazine, which published the book.
'The mentality of Chinese leaders is, 'If you don't respect me, I will teach
you a lesson'. This has nothing to do with rational behaviour.'
When Deng Xiaoping took power in the late 1970s, he is said to have outlined
three dreams: China's economic reform; the return of Hong Kong; and
reunification with Taiwan. The first has been largely achieved, the second
is well in hand but the last is slipping away.
Mr Lu Yali, politics professor at National Taiwan University, said 'tension
has built up across the Taiwan Strait', as Taipei's pursuit of an
international role for Taiwan has 'created speculation that the leaders in
China are not happy'. He doesn't think China will invade, but understands
the growing fears as part of the 'psychology' of Taiwan.
With each election in recent years, the opposition parties sap power from
the KMT which has ruled the island since 1949. Direct presidential elections
scheduled for early 1996 will consolidate the democratic legitimacy of a
government which has been transformed from a military dictatorship since
1987.
The policies of the KMT are converging with those of the DPP, and it is
becoming clear that regardless of who wins the presidential elections it
will essentially be on a platform of independence.
This could be an excuse for China to invade.
China's domestic turmoil will also be a catalyst for an attack, the book
argues.
An external conflict, whether successful or otherwise, will serve to
distract from problems at home and consolidate the power of Deng's
successors.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Boost for service jobs in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's labour market continues to be weak, but the mild recovery is
encouraging service industries to take on more staff, unemployment figures
released yesterday show.
The unemployment rate hovered at 3 per cent for the third month in a row in
September, just below the 3.1 per cent record set in May 1987, the labour
ministry said. A faint glimmer of improvement was evident in a rise in the
number of jobs on offer, from 63 per 100 applicants in August, to 64 in
September.
However, the improvement in the job seekers' ratio may be fragile because it
was entirely thanks to a possibly seasonal fall in the number of applicants
over that period. Taken over the year to September, by contrast, the number
of people looking for a job rose by 8.3 per cent.
Industrial production for September fell 1.5 per cent from a month earlier,
a sharper decline than was previously expected by private economists. The
figure was partly affected by the upward revision of industrial production
data for August, which rose 3.9 per cent from the previous month.
Shipments fell by 3 per cent on the month while the inventory index rose 1.5
per cent. The inventory to shipments ratio for the month, which fell by 3.1
points in August due to brisk retail sales, rose 3.5 points.
Production of electrical machinery fell 7.9 per cent, metal products dropped
4.9 per cent and 'other manufactured goods' declined 9.2 per cent. Precision
machinery rose 4.7 per cent and transportation equipment advanced 3.9 per
cent.
The latest employment figures suggest that the main hope for a recovery in
the labour market rests with service industries, where productivity is low
by international standards.
Employment by service companies rose 2.9 per cent in the year to September,
while manufacturing jobs fell by slightly more, 3 per cent, over the same
period.
Overall employment is now greater in services than manufacturing, according
to Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Barings Securities.
Consumer prices in Tokyo jumped by 0.8 per cent in the year to October, from
a 0.2 per cent rise in September, reflecting a rise in food prices caused by
the hot summer.
Excluding food, the core inflation rate remained unchanged, at 0.5 per cent,
confirming that there is little inflationary pressure as the recovery gets
under way.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Kohl's talks centre on spending cuts: Germany's coalition
negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The three parties in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new government emerged from
their first session of talks yesterday, vowing to modernise Germany but
promising to keep a very tight hold on its purse strings.
'Savings, savings, savings - that really is the most important element of
these talks,' said Mr Werner Hoyer, the general secretary of the Free
Democratic Party (FDP), the small liberal party which shores up the
coalition between Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the
Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU's more conservative Bavarian sister
party.
The new government will reduce the federal civil service by 1 per cent - or
12,000 jobs - a year, make legislation simpler, introduce new laws to
shorten notoriously complicated planning procedures and speed up court
cases.
'Our country is in danger of becoming paralysed,' said Mr Peter Hintze,
general secretary of the CDU. 'We have to work out why it is that we have
the greatest number of judges per head of population in Europe but court
cases still take longer than anywhere else.'
Another priority, following the first round of talks which focussed on tax
and economic policies, will be to cut back the Staatsquote - the proportion
of gross national product which is consumed by government spending - by 5
per cent to 46 per cent, where it was before German reunification.
However, the parties would not say how much money would be saved by making
cuts in social security spending, a thorny issue which has been thrust back
on the agenda by company bosses who fear the new government will not do
enough to cut Germany's high non-labour costs.
The three parties will continue talks until midday today and begin again on
Wednesday.
Each of them has sent five people to the talks which are being chaired by
Chancellor Kohl in the Bundeskanzleramt, his squat office complex. But for
the occasional break, the negotiators are expected to remain huddled in
there until mid-November.
The Bundestag, or lower chamber of parliament, will hold its opening session
in Berlin on November 10 but all eyes are focussed on Mr Kohl's re-election
as chancellor, a vote which is expected to take place in the week beginning
November 14.
However, the FDP has indicated it wants the coalition talks wrapped up and
future ministers named before a vote is called. Following its dismal
election result, the second worst since 1949, the party is under pressure to
secure as many concessions as it can from the talks before guaranteeing its
support for Mr Kohl whose new coalition has only a 10-seat majority in the
Bundestag.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the FDP leader, yesterday once again sought to stamp his
leadership on the party which had to live through a bitter and very public
bout of infighting after the election on October 16.
'The will to end the crisis in the FDP is there,' Mr Kinkel said. 'It is
high time (to do so) unless we want forever to remain the party which is
talked about more because of its squabbles than its policies.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / US asks UN to lift ban on Bosnia arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US last night introduced a UN Security Council resolution calling for a
lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia in six months unless the Bosnian
Serbs accept an international peace plan.
The resolution also seeks the 'orderly and safe redeployment' of UN
personnel in the Balkans if the embargo is lifted.
The resolution is virtually certain to be defeated because its does not have
the nine votes needed for passage in the 15-member council. Even if it did,
Russia could use its veto.
President Clinton has promised Congress that he will seek a multilateral
decision to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian government and will
consider lifting it unilaterally if that effort fails. But Mr Clinton
recently said it would be a mistake for Washington to lift the arms ban
unilaterally.
In Bosnia Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Serb leader, yesterday pledged to launch
a massive counter-attack to recover ground lost in a lightning offensive by
the Moslem Bosnian army.
Government forces were consolidating their grip on 80 square miles of
territory in northern Bosnia seized over the past three days.
Referring to this operation, a US state department spokesman said: 'The
Bosnian federation, which represents the principal victims of Serb
aggression, has understandably decided to exercise its right to defend
itself by force of arms.'
Mr David Johnson expressed 'regret that fighting has become necessary, and
that there will be more casualties in an area that has already seen more
than its share of conflict and suffering.' But he stressed that Washington
viewed the Bosnian Serbs as aggressors who had rejected an international
peace plan.
According to UN officials, the Bosnian Serbs - isolated from Belgrade and
facing a growing shortage of fuel - were caught unawares by the latest
onslaught and abandoned armour and equipment as they fled.
Mr Karadzic pledged last night that his forces would 'mount a drive to
encircle, destroy and expel Moslem forces from the territories of Serb
municipalities, using all permitted means.'
In other potentially ominous developments for the Bosnian Serbs, government
forces mounted an assault near the stronghold of Kupres, west of Sarajevo,
and the UN and Nato agreed on new procedures for air strikes.
The new rules allow for air strikes without warning and give greater
discretion - though by no means a free hand - to Nato in the selection of
targets.
The Moslem successes reflect a gradual shift in the balance of military
power inside Bosnia, thanks to clandestine supplies of light arms and the
'over-stretched' condition of the Bosnian-Serb army as it struggles to hold
on to 70 per cent of the republic's territory.
The flare-up in Bosnian fighting coincides with a breakthrough in
international efforts to achieve a broad reconciliation between Serbs and
Croats.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the mediators on former Yugoslavia,
announced that Zagreb and Belgrade would start regular consultations at
foreign minister level on normalising their relations.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has been told by western countries and
Russia that he should recognize Croatia as a precondition for further easing
of UN sanctions against his country.
On the face of things, both the Bosnian fighting and the peace moves in
Croatia are part of a single process: the decision by Mr Milosevic to seek
international favour and sever or at least loosen ties with his former
proteges in both neighbouring republics.
Under one scenario, a Belgrade-Zagreb reconciliation would deepen the
Bosnian Serbs' isolation and make them more willing to sue for peace on
acceptable terms.
But few observers see any prospect of the Bosnian partition plan devised by
four western nations and Russia being accepted in its current form.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Asterix birthday celebrations hit by real-life tussle: The
infighting in the French companies behind the successful sword-wielding
cartoon character
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asterix might do well to consider changing his name as he turns thirty-five
years old today. Megafrancx would suit the mustachioed, sword-wielding
midget well. The once-rebellious cartoon book character has found himself
sitting on a goldmine in his native kingdom of Gaul.
Celebrations are well in hand for the anniversary of the first edition on 29
October 1959 of Pilote, the French children's magazine in which the village
of invincible Gauls resisting their Roman oppressors first appeared, words
penned by Albert Goscinny and drawings by Rene Uderzo.
'I'm very happy,' says Mr Uderzo, reflecting on his feelings yesterday. He
is also rather surprised, and quite unable to explain the idea's sustained
popularity. 'I didn't expect success like this over such a long time at all.
It's a mystery.'
But not all those involved in creating the Asterix phenomenon will be
raising their goblets around the feasting table as they do at the end of
each of the books. In real life, unbeknown to millions of fans, a battle is
taking place just as vicious as any of the fictional plots.
There is no disputing the success of the Asterix bandwagonix. More than 250m
copies of the 29 albums have been sold around the world. Editions Albert
Rene, which now publishes the books, reported turnover of FFr45m (Pounds
5.4m) last year, while Dargard, the original publisher, still generates
almost as much again.
There have been six animated Asterix films, with the latest used as the
centrepiece for a marketing campaign across Europe by McDonalds. Another is
in train, and there are discussions about one starring real actors including
Gerard Depardieu as Obelix (who polls show to be even more popular than
Asterix).
There is even an Asterix theme park on the outskirts of Paris, which has
just broken into profits after five years and attracted 1.5m visitors this
year. One survey showed that more than half of the French population could
spontaneously name Asterix - higher than for either Mickey Mouse or Tintin.
Some argue that the success of the books has been to create a series of
characters who are uniquely and defiantly French, with stories which work on
many different levels with clever wordplays to appeal to adults as well as
children.
Yet Asterix also appeals in other countries. While more than 94m albums have
sold in France, another 82m have been bought by Germans, followed by the
British at 19m. Asterix has been printed in 57 languages and dialects,
including Latin. The latest interest has come from Slovenia and Croatian
companies. 'We work with humourists more than translaters when publishing
the books in other languages,' says Mr Claude de Saint Vincent, chairman of
Dargaud.
He is equally mystified by the obviously contagious effect of the 'magic
potion' handed out by the village sorcerer Panoramix. 'If I knew the secret,
I would do another one,' he says. 'But it came at a time before TV, videos,
computers and video games. There were not so many distractions for readers.'
But some of the Asterix magic has now worn off. Mr de Saint Vincent believes
the market is now mature, boosted occasionally with the publication of new
albums - and perhaps greater penetration in the UK. His company will receive
none of the profits from the most recent five books - nor will it from any
published in the future.
The reason is a bitter dispute which developed between Dargaud, which owned
Pilote, and Goscinny and Uderzo. It culminated in a Parisian courtroom, with
Uderzo trying to win all the rights to the back titles. He lost on appeal
this summer, but retains ownership of the Asterix character and freedom to
keep profits from new productions. He has not spoken to Dargaud since, which
has had its offers of help in the birthday celebrations ignored.
Goscinny, the author, died in 1977 but Uderzo decided to carry on alone,
producing both words and drawings. Some readers feel however - though few
would dare to say so in public - that the quality of the Asterix books has
declined with the end of the old partnership.
Uderzo, aged 67, says he has no plans to stop.
But his struggles are not confined to the drawing board. In 1979 Uderzo
managed to break away from Dargaud to found his own company, Editions Albert
Rene. He gave Goscinny's widow 20 per cent of the shares, keeping the rest
for himself.
She has now also died, and her 26-year old daughter Anne has started legal
action against Uderzo, claiming that her family did not receive a fair share
of support or profits. 'I am very happy about the success of the character -
in the way it was created with my father,' she says.

FT  29 OCT 94 / BAT uphill task to secure deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries can make a good case that its takeover of American Tobacco
will increase competition in the US cigarette market but it faces an uphill
battle to win court approval for the deal, analysts said yesterday. The
Federal Trade Commission is trying to halt the acquisition because it
believes a reduction in the number of manufacturers will make it easier for
those remaining to set prices to their advantage. 'I find BAT to be very
price competitive,' said Ms Diana Temple of Salomon Brothers in New York,
'but it will be hard for BAT to get the FTC's opposition overturned in
court.' 'It is genuinely a bizarre ruling by the FTC because the cigarette
market would never accept price rises,' said a leading London analyst. But
with the court outcome unpredictable because of political overtones, 'BAT
has an even chance, perhaps no better, of winning.' The FTC goes to court in
New York City on Monday to seek a temporary injunction to block BAT's
Dollars 1bn purchase of American Tobacco from American Brands. A full trial
will begin in the first week of December.
If BAT loses it could appeal to the federal second circuit appeals court.
There would be insufficient time to take the case to the Supreme Court
because BAT's option on American Tobacco expires next April.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Italy names EU commissioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The partners in Italy's right wing coalition yesterday patched up a
compromise deal and named their new European Union commissioners.
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday named Mr Mario Monti, a respected
economist, and Ms Emma Bonino a Radical Party politician, to fill Italy's
two posts.
The last-minute appointments, a day before new commission president Jacques
Santer is due to meet his team and assign portfolios, ended weeks of
political arm-wrestling in Berlusconi's coalition over whom to send to
Brussels.
The compromise followed two months of indecision. In September broad
agreement had been reached on Mr Monti, who is head of Milan's Bocconi
University, for one of the economic portfolios.
The coalition partners decided that with one 'technician', the other had to
be a politician of some weight.
The populist Northern League argued that one of their members be the
commissioner as the coalition group with the largest number of deputies. Mr
Umberto Bossi, the League leader, proposed Mr Francesco Speroni, Minister of
Institutional Reform, as their candidate.
Mr Berlusconi's,own party Forza Italia, and their main allies the
Neo-Fascist MSI National Alliance, were against giving the league this prize
when Mr Umberto Bossi, had consistently done his best to embarass the
government. As an alternative, Mr Giorgio Napolitano, the former speaker of
the Chamber of Deputies and a veteran of the communist party and its
successor the Party of The Democratic Left (PDS), was also suggested.
However, Ms Emma Bonino, who has extensive experience of the European
Parliament, was chosen as a compromise by Mr Berlusconi.

FT  29 OCT 94 / US taking tougher antitrust stance: The trend to more active
intervention in competition questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Trade Commission's decision to challenge BAT Industries'
Dollars 1bn bid to take over American Tobacco has raised questions about
whether the US government is taking a more aggressive approach to
competition questions under the Clinton administration.
Washington antitrust lawyers say that the evidence of a tougher approach is
clear at the Justice Department, which shares jurisdiction over antitrust
questions with the FTC, but note that all three FTC commissioners who took
part in the BAT decision were appointed by President Ronald Reagan or
President George Bush.
One commissioner, Ms Christine Varney, has been appointed by President Bill
Clinton, but she has only just started work at the commission and did not
vote on BAT. Mr Clinton's nominee for the chairmanship, Mr Robert Pitofsky,
has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.
In addition, almost all the senior staff at the commission have been in
place for several years. Some FTC lawyers also argue that the kinds of
merger they are being asked to examine are different from the typical merger
of the 1980s, which often involved companies in different sectors with few
overlapping markets.
Yet competition lawyers say the change in approach is palpable not just at
the Justice Department, where assistant attorney general Anne Bingaman has
taken on issues that have not been touched in recent years, but also at the
FTC.
'Both agencies have become much more aggressive both on matters of substance
and on procedural matters,' says one former government antitrust lawyer.
Other legal experts say that although Commissioner Roscoe Starek is
noticeably conservative in his approach to antitrust questions, Commissioner
Janet Steiger, the acting chair, and Commissioner Mary Azcuenaga are more
accurately labelled independents. Both are thought to be interested in
winning reappointment from the Clinton administration.
On the matter of substance, the Justice Department has filed the first cases
for a decade involving US claims of jurisdiction over anti-competitive
action overseas affecting US exporters, rather than US consumers.
The FTC, meanwhile, is believed by Washington lawyers to be looking at
bringing some cases involving vertical competition questions, where the
relationship may be between supplier and customer, rather than the
horizontal relationship between two competitors that is involved in the BAT
case.
Some FTC staff lawyers are also looking for a case that would challenge
earlier doctrine on the existence of potential competition.
The government can overlook the fact that a merger between two competitors
would substantially increase concentration in a particular market if it
believes the market to be open to potential new competitors. But current
doctrine requires good evidence that someone actually intends to enter the
market, rather than just theoretical evidence that someone could easily do
so.
In procedural matters, antitrust lawyers say the two agencies have been
competing aggressively for cases, and the decision on which one should look
at a particular merger is being taken later and later in the process.
Though mergers in some sectors such as airlines are allocated by law to
Justice, the decision is mostly taken at the staff level on the basis of
which agency has most expertise in the sector. The FTC generally
investigates soft drinks, for example, while Justice takes beer, and the FTC
has in the past generally taken tobacco industry mergers.
The two fought long and hard for jurisdiction over the big merger between
Martin Marietta and Lockheed, with the FTC eventually winning possession.
This means that when the case is eventually allotted to the FTC or Justice,
the government's lawyers are running out of time to investigate the case in
the initial period allowed by the law. They are thus filing more and more
'second requests' for information, which extends the deadline for a decision
but also requires companies to produce much more documentation at great
expense.
When Mr Pitofsky eventually takes office, few doubt that he will carry on
the trend to more active intervention in competition questions. In an
influential article on antitrust published in a policy compendium presented
to Mr Clinton by the Citizens Transition Project just after his election in
1992, Mr Pitofsky argued for an immediate revival of enforcement 'to undo
the damage of a decade of trivialising and blaming antitrust'.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Polite applause in Duma greets Solzhenitsyn's moral outrage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russia's most famous living writer and symbol of
resistance to communism, yesterday hurled a bolt of moral outrage at
Russia's political leadership - accusing it of indifference to suffering,
incompetence, betrayal of the state and gross corruption.
The 50-minute address to the State Duma (Lower House) contained all the
themes the writer wove together in 20 years of exile, sharpened by his
exposure to the Russian people through 'hundreds of meetings and thousands
of letters'.
The people, he said, 'have lost heart ..they do not believe the reforms
undertaken by this government are in their interests'.
Yet his moving articulation of the plight of his fellow countrymen was
rewarded with perfunctory applause by deputies.
'Russia,' he said, 'is not a democracy but an oligarchy - power of a very
limited number of people. People who knew I was to talk here said to me:
'Tell the duma, tell the president, about what simple people have in their
hearts'.
The authorities, he said, had few links with the 'sickness of the country'.
People at the grass roots had practically been excluded from public life.
'Everything goes on to one side of them. They have only one miserable choice
 -to drag out a lowly and humble existence, or to cheat on the state and
each other.'
In a direct attack on President Boris Yeltsin and the reformers in
government, he said the sale of land was tantamount to 'selling Russia'. On
privatisation he said the process 'had taught 70m people a very hard lesson
 -never believe the state and never work honestly.'
He restated two major themes of his political writing. The first of these
was the demand to end the 'lifeless' Commonwealth of Independent States in
favour of a new federal state composed of the Slav countries - Russia,
Ukraine and Belarus, with Kazakhstan.
The second was to recreate, the network of zemstvos, rural councils of the
kind operating at the turn of the century.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Getting dirty in Delaware: US mid-term elections, November 8
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WILMINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Delaware, the first state to ratify the US constitution but the second
smallest in land area, rarely hits the headlines, unless they are made by a
Du Pont, company or family. But, politically, this year is rather different.
It is one of the very few states where a Republican incumbent, Senator Bill
Roth, is in measurable danger. His defeat could mean the Democrats keep
control of the Senate. His Democratic opponent, Charlie Oberly, is running a
campaign lifted from the Republican anti-incumbent handbook. Perhaps most
shocking of all for a state where moderation is rated a virtue, Delaware is
witnessing a dirty race.
Senator Roth, now 73, has been a fixture in Washington for 28 years, the
last 24 in the Senate. This fits the Delaware tradition. No incumbent has
been voted out of office in the last decade and Joseph Biden, the state's
Democratic senator, was elected in 1972.
Dour and toupeed, Mr Roth has compiled a solid record for his state and
sometimes on national issues without ever being rated a political
heavyweight. The Kemp-Roth tax cut proposals of the late 1970s were a
precursor of Reagan administration policies, while his advocacy of personal
pension plans, known in the US as independent retirement accounts, has been
second to none.
Mr Oberly, 47 and a three-time state attorney general, is taking aim at this
longevity, calculating that national discontent with the political
establishment in the capital applies to Republicans as much as it does to
Democrats.
He has sought to make Mr Roth's age an issue, with one commercial showing
his opponent trudging along the campaign trail in slow motion. He has also
recalled that early in his career Mr Roth proposed a constitutional
amendment banning senators from seeking re-election after their 70th
birthday (the senator put this down to 'the folly of my youth'.)
The Roth counter is that the state needs a person of his seniority, 10th in
the Senate, to keep 'the big spenders' of Washington in check. One of his
advertisements says he would never consider ending the tax deduction on
mortage interest payments - not that Mr Oberly appears to have said it
should be removed.
This may seem pallid stuff by the debased standards of the campaign in
neighbouring Virginia, but this week Delaware has become much rougher. Mr
Roth has charged that, as attorney general, Mr Oberly refused to recommend a
sentence of life without parole for a murderer. Mr Oberly said that that
incident, in 1990, was the result of a mix-up in legal papers presented to
him and was remedied within 15 days. His campaign immediately portrayed the
Roth accusation as an attempt to replay the 'Willie Horton' card - referring
to the 1988 presidential election commercial that sought to portray Mr
Michael Dukakis as soft on crime.
This descent to the relative political gutter seems to disturb the state,
according to Allan Loudell, programme director of WILM, the excellent local
radio news station. There is division, however, as to who started it.
Polling data only comes from the two campaigns. The senator's polls still
have him ahead by more than ten points, much less in the summer, while Mr
Oberly's put his deficit in single digits and declining.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Stable US inflation figures lift world financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew strongly in the third quarter but inflation remained
under control, giving a fillip to world financial markets yesterday.
Gross domestic product increased at an annualised rate of 3.4 per cent in
the July to September quarter, according to advance estimates released by
the Commerce Department's bureau of economic analysis.
This was slower than the second quarter's 4.1 per cent but much faster than
the 2.8 per cent to 3 per cent growth anticipated by private sector
economists.
Although evidence of a still buoyant economy might have been expected to
alarm financial markets, the signs of moderate inflation helped to lift bond
and share prices.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 55.51 to close at 3,930.66, having
triggered the trading restrictions on the New York Stock Exchange that
automatically follow a 50-point move in one session. Bonds soared to send
key 30-year bond yields below 8 per cent for the first time in a week.
Wall Street's strength fed through to European equity markets, with the
FT-SE 100 Index in London closing 54.2 higher at 3,083.8.
In Paris, the CAC-40 index was up 2.6 per cent on the day, while in
Frankfurt, the Dax index rose 1.9 per cent in after-hours trading. The GDP
figures also buoyed the dollar, which rose 1 1/2 pfennigs to close in London
at DM1.5094.
Markets took heart from the implicit price deflator, which reflects changes
in prices and in the composition of GDP. This rose by only 1.6 per cent, but
was flattered by a sharp increase in import prices, which are not included
in the domestic statistics. A more reliable inflationary indicator, the GDP
fixed weight price index for domestic purchases, showed inflation remaining
stable at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent.
Personal consumption grew 3.0 per cent, after the second quarter's low 1.3
per cent rise.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Russians fear for health in wake of oil spill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KOLVA, KOMI REPUBLIC,, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
For Mrs Cheslava Potova, mayor of the tiny settlement of Kolva on the river
of the same name, the amount of oil that has seeped into the land around her
village recently has been a difference only of degree.
'The pollution in the river is such that there are hardly any fish left  -
it had been a staple food here. Now, when you catch one, it reeks of oil,'
she said.
The oil spill from a temporary dam, caused by a ruptured pipe, prompted
international fears this week of an environmental disaster in the Arctic.
But the reaction by the authorities has been slow - oil oozed into the river
a month ago and it took three days for 'specialists' to arrive for the
clean-up.
'I don't say people were afraid, but they do think of the future and want to
make sure this does not happen again. People were very unsettled and upset,'
Mrs Potova said.
'We drink milk from the cows and we eat food grown in the soil all about us.
We do not know how much oil it might contain. The banks of the river are
already polluted with oil, and people are worried about their health.'
In Usinsk, the nearest large town, 40km from the spill, Mr Yevgeny Leskin,
director-general of the Komi Arctic Oil joint venture, revealed why the
area's inhabitants are right to worry.
'Such accidents are not uncommon in Russia, although this one was more
serious than most. The accident happened in mid-August, but the rains broke
the dam only in September. The oil flooded the marshes. The workers tried to
dam the flow into the Kolva river but we reckon about 2,500 tonnes got into
it.'
Mr Leskin, whose company helped with the clean-up, said about 11,000 tonnes
of oil remain in the marshes. He said it would be cleared before the April
thaw, which could spread it again. The Russian environment ministry said
yesterday that offers of help from abroad would not be taken up until the
scale of the accident was fully known.
However yesterday an appeal for help was made by Mr YA Spiridonov, president
of the Komi republic, to the Northern Forum, the multinational Arctic group.
Accounts of the amount of oil leaked range from the official inquiry report
of 14,000 tonnes to US calculations of 100,000 tonnes.
Komi authorities estimate that the clean-up could cost Rbs60bn (Pounds 12m),
while western estimates have put the figure as high as Pounds 62m.
The official news agency Itar Tass took the unusual step last night of
publishing a list of fires, oil spills and pipeline breaks affecting the
Komi Republic's oil complex. It said 8,000 tonnes of oil leaked into the
Pechora River in June 1992 - 18 months after a fire had destroyed an oil
well in the region. In March 1988, 20,000 tonnes of oil leaked from a
corroded pipe and, in 1986, a pumping station fire caused damage worth
Pounds 120,000.

FT  29 OCT 94 / GEC offers Pounds 532m for VSE: BAe attacks rival higher bid
for submarine-maker as its own shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC, the UK defence and electronics company, yesterday stepped into the bid
battle for nuclear submarine-maker VSEL with a Pounds 14-a-share cash offer
which values the Barrow-based company at Pounds 532m.
This tops the all-share offer launched by British Aerospace for VSEL two
weeks ago, which valued VSEL at exactly Pounds 13 a share on Thursday night.
VSEL's board, which had backed BAe's bid, refused to endorse either offer
until clearance for the bids had been given by the Office of Fair Trading.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said yesterday that he would not
use the government's special national security powers over VSEL to block
either bid.
VSEL's shares rose 72p to Pounds 13.95, while GEC gained 8p to 278p. British
Aerospace's shares fell 16p to 459p, reducing the value of its offer to
Pounds 12.60 per VSEL share.
GEC said its offer would allow the two remaining warship building yards to
be brought together, pooling their design and engineering skills, and that
the integration of the two yards would allow their long-term future to be
guaranteed.
The company said its marketing arm would be able to help VSEL win overseas
orders. GEC also said it did not think its ownership of the two large
warship yards presented competition problems. Due to the low level of
orders, there would in practice be little overlap between the work of Barrow
and Yarrow. The ministry of defence, which had previously been indicating
privately that it would oppose a GEC takeover of the Barrow yard, refused to
comment.
At the heart of the battle is the future of the British defence industry. As
well as competing for the Pounds 2.5bn order for nuclear submarines due to
be placed in 1996, the two companies are trying to strengthen their
positions for the final stage of rationalisation of the defence industry.
At its most extreme, this could involve the merger of BAe's and GEC's
defence interests.
BAe strongly attacked the GEC bid, saying that it was 'wholly inconsistent
with the Ministry of Defence's declared policy in relation to defence
procurement'.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, said: 'GEC's bid raises profound
competition issues and I would expect it to be blocked.'
City observers expect BAe to raise its offer, but they also think that GEC's
greater financial resources would allow it to win a bidding war. BAe's
defence would then rest on persuading the government to block GEC's bid on
competition grounds.
GEC is expected to have to give assurances about the future of the Yarrow
shipyard on the Clyde if its bid is to be cleared. However, one City
observer said: 'These assurances can be flexible. Barrow can build small
frigates and large warships, but Yarrow can only build small frigates. If I
were at Yarrow, I would be worried.'
GEC dismissed such concerns and said: 'It is our intention to secure enough
work to fill both yards'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Irish debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The transformation of Irish Permanent from Ireland's biggest building
society to a bank was completed yesterday, with shares in the group making a
sparkling debut simultaneously in Dublin and London.
In a move almost a mirror image of that carried out some years ago by Abbey
National, Irish Permanent shares were given to borrowers and lenders and
priced at 180p in the Republic of Ireland, the equivalent of 180p sterling.
The flotation was organised jointly by Riada, the Irish stockbroker, and
Hoare Govett.
After opening at 208p the shares raced ahead to touch a high of 217p before
closing at 215p. Turnover reached 6.1m shares with dealers reporting
aggressive demand for the shares from Ireland and the UK.
Excellent third-quarter figures from Shell Oil, the Royal Dutch/Shell
subsidiary, triggered a bout of strong support for Shell Transport stock
from both sides of the Atlantic. At the close Shell were 11 1/2 higher at
711 1/2 p after turnover of 3.9m shares. Analysts moved to upgrade forecasts
for Shell Transport after the Shell Oil numbers, its best third-quarter
results since 1985.
'We're upgrading our recommendation on Shell from hold to buy,' said Mr John
Toalster at Strauss Turnbull. 'There is a feeling of confidence about Shell;
they're tackling the problem areas, such as chemicals, and the recovery in
the group is gathering momentum,' the Strauss analyst said.
BP was rather left behind by Shell, the shares edging up only 2 to 415 1/2 p
on 7.2m traded.
Airports group BAA rose 11 to 503p following a reassuring note from NatWest
Securities which attempts to put the Heathrow subsidence problems into
perspective.
Heathrow accounted for 59 per cent of passengers handled by BAA last year
and 68 per cent of operating profits. NatWest says the disruption is
squeezing spending levels but sees higher spending at other BAA airports as
a cushion as traffic switches.
Second quarter results are due November 7.
Media conglomerate Pearson was a strong performer on the back of broker
presentations regarding the impending flotation of satellite broadcaster
BSkyB, in which Pearson has a significant stake. The shares jumped 18 to
613p.
Reuters Holdings slipped 3 to 447p ahead of third-quarter revenue figures
due today.
International advertising group WPP jumped 4 to 109p on heavier turnover
than normal of 7.8m shares with SG Warburg recommending the stock.
Medeva jumped 15 and closed 9 better at 174p after announcing it had won the
right to continue development of its hepatitis B vaccine following a
judgment by the Court of Appeal that Biogen's patent is invalid in the UK.
Drinks group Allied Domecq advanced 13 to 587p following the announcement of
talks aimed at selling its Dutch brewing operations helped refocus attention
on the potentially much bigger disposal of Allied's food manufacturing
business.
Best known for its Tetley tea-bags, the food division accounted for more
than a tenth of group trading profits last year.
A number of potential buyers are being pencilled in by the stock market,
notably the Dalgety and Irish group Kerry which is said to be keen to
acquire DCA, Allied's US supplier of bakery mixes and equipment.
Elsewhere in the drinks sector, Bass continued to gain ground, adding 6 to
547p for a three day gain of almost 4 per cent. In contrast, Greenalls shed
4 to 405p. High street fashion chain Next rose 6 to 242p as Morgan Stanley
reiterated its strong buy stance.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways was the most actively traded Footsie constituent, turning
over 13m shares and falling steeply in the wake of a placing of a large line
of stock and persistent bearish comment on the outlook for 25 per cent-owned
USAir.
BA shares tumbled 10 1/2 to 353 1/2 p for a two-day decline of some 5 per
cent. The interim statement is due on November 8 and worries about a
possible write-off of part of the group's Pounds 275m investment in
loss-ridden USAir are likely to continue to the run up to the results
announcement.
The big problem for BA yesterday though was block trades of 4.4m and 2.7m
shares at 346 1/4 p and 349p respectively which crossed the screens in
mid-afternoon. Talk in the market was that SG Warburg had handled the deals
and been left holding a large line of stock.
Position-taking in BA was also reflected in substantial traded option
business.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals giant ICI came up with some very solid figures yesterday but the
market wanted something extra and reacted accordingly when it didn't get it.
Analysts had expected the profits between Pounds 120m and Pounds 145m. The
final figure was Pounds 143m accompanied with a meeting generally
acknowledged to be positive. Analysts upgraded forecasts but marketmakers
had generally been long of stock and the surplus saw the shares fall 12 1/2
to 786 1/2 p with 4.6m traded.
The reaction was much as anticipated following strong outperformance against
the broad market over the past six months. But there were divided views
afterwards. James Capel, which has a top of the range forecast of Pounds
520m for the full year, reiterated its view that 'the market is already
discounting very strong profit growth'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Hints of Hydro move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumours swept the market late yesterday that Scottish Hydro had called a
meeting of analysts for this morning, triggering speculation that it may
announce it will accept the terms of the recent regulatory review rather
than ask for a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Hydro shares underperformed the rest of the electricity stocks as the
rumours circulated, closing unchanged at 313p, contrasting with a 7 gain to
349p in Scottish Power and good gains in the English generators.
Hydro shares have underperformed the market by 10 per cent since the Offer
review last month, as some analysts have adopted the view that the package
would damage Hydro's dividend growth prospects.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures pushed ahead strongly to reverse a four-day run of
declines but activity remained low, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,042 at the official 4:10 close, up 49
points. This was a 14-point premium to the cash market and right in line
with current fair value.
The upsurge mostly followed the rally in German bonds and the better tone on
Wall Street, and traders have begun to speculate on an immediate move for
the contract above 3,050.
The best of the day was 3,047, reached towards the end of business. Some of
the more optimistic traders were beginning to see the recovery as an
overture to the long awaited Christmas rally.
The disappointing aspect of the day was the lack of genuine business with
institutional activity negligible and most of the day's turnover generated
by locals, independent traders.
There were 11,044 contracts, broadly in line with the previous day's 10,594.
This was substantially below last week's average of 13,500.
Traded options fell significantly short of the previous day with 20,877 lots
against 53,080. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just over 11,000
lots.
British Airways was the most heavily traded individual stock option with
1,377 lots.

FT  28 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bonds lead the stock market to a
strong close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London stock market yesterday turned in its first convincingly positive
session this week as good performances from US and European bonds set the
scene for the US gross domestic product data due from Washington this
afternoon. The FT-SE 100 Share Index comfortably regained the 3,000 mark,
trading volume remained poor and there were hints that a leading UK
investment bank will cut staff today.
A strong lead from the stock index futures market and from British
government bonds drove the stock market to the day's peak at the close. The
final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 3,029.6, with a net gain of
29.7.
The rebound was something of a surprise. Indeed, the market was 6 points off
on the Footsie scale in early deals as traders shied away from any
continuation of the weakness at the close of the previous session. The mood
turned as German bunds turned higher after the deputy president of the
Bundesbank suggested that the German central bank might soon return to
variable rate repos.
Although warned not to do so, markets took this as a bullish sign, and were
not put off by the expected decision at the Bundesbank's policy meeting to
leave key rates unchanged, nor by the announcement that this week's repo
would be at a fixed rate.
The stock market climbed steadily during the first half of the session, with
individual companies providing a number of features. Good results from ICI
had been well discounted in the marketplace and profit-takers cut into the
share price following the boardroom announcement.
But the impending flotation of BSkyB continued to help shares in the
stakeholders and the flow of higher corporate profits from US companies
continued, with Shell Transport and Trading very firm following the trading
statement from Shell Oil.
The final boost came when the US Federal bond market opened higher, taking
the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by 12 points in UK trading hours. The
gain in the Footsie was quickly extended from 16 points at mid-afternoon to
its closing gain of nearly 30 points. The final hour of trading saw share
prices rising rapidly as marketmakers faced an unexpected demand for stock
and hurried round the market, searching topping up their own trading books
which have been kept on very tight reins for the past few weeks.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index more than recovered its fall of the previous
session, closing 12.9 higher at 3,480.1. While pleasantly surprised by the
market's resilience in recapturing the Footsie 3,000 mark so convincingly,
analysts remained cautious ahead of today's US GDP number. US third-quarter
growth is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, according to UK based
strategists; a higher figure will inevitably revive concerns about
inflation, the dollar and the attitude of the Federal Reserve, and revive
speculation in London regarding the timing of the next base rate hike.
The wider concern of the UK stock market is the lack of equity business and
yesterday's volume figures emphasised the dearth of business. Seaq volume of
507.2m shares showed a further fall of around 3 per cent. The day's total of
bargains booked in shares, at just over 21,000, remained barely two thirds
of the average for the past two years.
Low turnover is taking its toll not only of confidence at stockbroking
firms, where commission income is at risk, but also in the daily
marketplace. Volatility in share prices has reflected unwillingness of
marketmakers to run positions in such a thinly-traded market. This has
increased the influence of the stock index futures arena, which is often
accused of driving the underlying stock market.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Commodities lift Sydney
as Japan Tobacco plunges
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The market was unaffected by the sharp fall in Japan Tobacco, whose shares
were listed yesterday, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher on
arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 closed up 50.01 at 19,796.36 after a high of 19,919.88 and a
low of 19,724.44. Dealers bought shares on the first trading day for
November settlement, while overseas investors also supported prices.
Volume was 210m shares against 215m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 1.50 to 1,568.44 and the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.54 to 287.14.
Advances led declines by 479 to 461 with 221 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.30 to 1,292.90.
Japan Tobacco plunged 23.5 per cent from its public offering price to Y1.1m.
Early in the day, the stock failed to trade due to lack of buyers, but it
changed hands in the afternoon at Y1.19m. Traders said investors who had
bought stock at the lower end of the pre-offer auction were trying to take
profits. Investors who had bought the stock on margin were also forced to
liquidate their holdings when the offered price fell below Y1.3m.
Traders said the focus for market participants was on corporate earnings and
the currency market now JT was listed. 'We can now detach ourselves from
JT,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Buying by overseas investors supported Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which
rose Y6,000 to Y892,000. But East Japan Railway, the railway group
privatised last year, lost Y3,000 to Y480,000, and Japan Telecom fell
Y70,000 to Y3.68m.
High-technology stocks were supported by prospects of strong profits. Sharp
rose Y10 to Y1,790 and Toshiba Y6 to Y764. However, some issues fell on
profit-taking, with Matsushita Electric Industrial down Y10 to Y1,580 and
Mitsubishi Electric losing Y2 to Y723.
Steel shares were firmer: Nippon Steel rose Y2 to Y394 and Sumitomo Metal
Industries added Y10 to Y354. Mitsubishi Oil lost Y40 to Y1,020 on
profit-taking. The stock had been supported by speculative buying on hopes
of its oil digging project in Vietnam.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 13.27 to 21,965.36 in volume of 25.3m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y140 to Y5,290.
Roundup
Commodities-based gains in Australia and a continued buyers' strike in the
embattled Taiwan equity market were the main features in the region
yesterday.
SYDNEY followed Australia's largest company, BHP, which reached an intra-day
record high on the rosy outlook for mineral ores after the bull-run in base
metals found new impetus on the London Metal Exchange on Wednesday.
BHP rose 42 cents to ADollars 20.50 after peaking at ADollars 20.56. The All
Resources index rose 18.4 to 1,422.9, towing the All Ordinaries to a gain of
14.6 at 2,032.2. Turnover was strong at ADollars 538.1m.
The copper price, which jumped USDollars 41 to a four-year high of USDollars
2,627 a tonne, was said to be the source of BHP's strength, but other large
miners were firmer on the back of much stronger base metals prices, and on
support from domestic investors. CRA rose 32 cents to ADollars 18.90,
Western Mining climbed 13 to ADollars 8.37, and MIM advanced 5 to ADollars
2.90.
HONG KONG achieved a technical recovery but activity stayed thin, the Hang
Seng index closing up 52.14 at 9,304.58, well off its 9,341.40 session high
as turnover improved marginally from HKDollars 2.02bn to HKDollars 2.27bn.
Wednesday's successful test of 9,200 on the Hang Seng and Wall Street's
ability to avoid a heavy sell-off overnight, combined with news that Britain
and China might be close to a financing agreement on Hong Kong's new
airport, boosted flagging sentiment.
Overseas buying lifted Hongkong Land, which rose 55 cents to HKDollars
19.10. Other property stocks also gained, with Henderson Land up 40 cents at
HKDollars 48.80 and Cheung Kong by 30 cents to HKDollars 35.90.
WELLINGTON thanked Telecom, once again, for a 12 cents gain on continuing
demand to NZDollars 5.62 which accounted for around 13 points of a 21.10
rise to 2,090.42 in the NZSE-40 Index in turnover of NZDollars 47m.
Fletcher Challenge also performed well, rising 5 cents to NZDollars 4.36,
and Fletcher Forest closed up 1 cent at NZDollars 2.10 amid speculation
about foreign demand.
COLOMBO's all share index recovered for the first time after Monday's
assassination of an opposition leader, widespread blue chip buying taking it
up 9.41 to 1,087.56. Turnover rose from Rs47.21m to Rs187.36m.
TAIPEI reversed small early gains to close sharply lower for the fourth
consecutive session, and brokers expected the market to remain depressed.
The weighted index lost 90.90 or 1.4 per cent to 6,594.97 in turnover of
TDollars 44.4bn.
Financials led the fall with China Bills losing TDollars 2.70 or 5.6 per
cent to TDollars 45.90.
Food and polyester shares performed relatively well, with Shinkong Synthetic
Fibres gaining 30 cents to TDollars 26.90. President Enterprises rebounded
after Wednesday's fall, gaining TDollars 1.50 to TDollars 58.
Hualon fell TDollars 1 to TDollars 18.70 after the prosecutor's office
started to investigate a TDollars 3.35bn share payment default related to
the group.
MANILA declined marginally ahead of a four-day holiday weekend, with
Philippine National Bank leading the declines.
The composite index finished 18.01 lower at 3,060.25 in volume of 2.95bn
shares worth 1.34bn pesos.
PNB, the country's largest commercial bank, fell 4.35 per cent to 385 pesos
on news of a 28 per cent drop in its net profit to 1.2bn pesos in the first
nine months against 1.67bn in the same period last year.
Gainers were led by Jollibee Foods which advanced 8.6 per cent to 15.75
pesos followed by Bacnotan Cement which rose 4.6 per cent to 34 pesos.
BANGKOK retreated but brokers expected the market to make headway today
after the Bank of Thailand announced that inflation was under control and
stringent monetary measures were now unnecessary. The SET index slipped
12.34 to 1,501.73 after fluctuating between 1,495.41 and 1,518.90 in
turnover of Bt8.1bn.
Bank of Thailand officials said the bank was sticking to its earlier
estimate of a 4.8 per cent growth in the consumer price index for 1994.
The finance sector was the biggest loser, falling 2.1 per cent on Bt1.2bn
turnover.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan excited by L2,000bn
Romagnolo bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unchanged interest rates at yesterday's Bundesbank meeting were no surprise;
and they were in character with a day which, for once, let individual
corporate stories make their mark on share prices, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was excited by the L2,000bn bid launched by Credito Italiano for the
Bologna-based Credito Romagnolo.
The Comit index improved 2.32 to 612.73.
Credito Italiano said that it would pay L19,000 a share for a 48.2 per cent
stake in Romagnolo, which would take its stake above 50 per cent. Analysts
at James Capel commented that while it was a hefty price to pay, and would
be earnings dilutive, strategically the move made sense. Credito Italiano,
the broker said, was historically exposed to the large corporate business
sector, and lacked a customer base in which it could cross-sell its
products. This would be provided by Romagnolo which had a very rich customer
base, managing a lot of assets off-balance sheet.
The takeover could make Credito Italiano the country's largest retail
operation, adding Romagnolo's 400 branches to its 850 outlets. The takeover
offer would be conditional on securing the agreement of other minority
shareholders, which included a 4.9 per cent stake held by Cofide, controlled
by the De Benedetti group, and BNP, the French bank, which holds 6.8 per
cent.
Credito Italiano fell sharply on the news, losing 1.5 per cent to L1,592,
but off a session low of L1,540. Credito Romagnolo rose sharply, up L2,390
to L16,100.
The news affected other banks. Ambroveneto soared 11.4 per cent to L4,332 on
suggestions that it could be the next takeover target, while BCI lost 2.3
per cent to L3,390.
FRANKFURT eased a little after the Buba meeting and the Dax index closed the
official trading session 7.30 lower at 2,013.20, but the real measure of the
day's trading was in the post-bourse where the Ibis indicated Dax eventually
ended 16.92 higher, or 0.8 per cent, at 2,026.37.
Turnover eased from DM5.5bn to DM5.2bn. Nine-month turnover figures from
Daimler and Linde helped the carmaker and engineer advance by DM11.50 to
DM753.50, and the forklift specialist by DM23 to DM886.
Mr Adrian Phillips at Kleinwort Benson said that Daimler's figures were much
as expected but that the slightly better dollar might have given it some
encouragement. Linde, he noted, had produced good figures on Wednesday
afternoon but the stock tended to move little in Ibis trading, generally
reserving its reactions for the official session.
Major session moves included a DM24 rise to DM800 in Philipp Holzmann, the
construction group, after Deutsche Bank said that it might sell its 25.8 per
cent holding; Hochtief, Holzmann's fellow construction group, has takeover
ambitions. Meanwhile Weru, the window frame manufacturer, had another
setback yesterday; its shares, hit severely by broker downgrades last week,
fell DM21 to DM820; brokers said that an analysts' meeting had been
cancelled.
PARIS rallied on stability in the currency markets, although turnover was
low as some investors began to wind down ahead of the long weekend holiday.
The French financial markets will be closed on Monday and Tuesday.
The CAC-40 index rose 26.57 or 1.4 per cent to 1,858.11 in turnover
estimated at under FFr3bn. L'Oreal, which reported a 6.5 per cent rise in
first-half consolidated pretax profit to FFr2.6bn, slightly below
expectations, rose FFr33 or 3 per cent to FFr1,064.
Eurotunnel showed an improvement in performance following recent bad
publicity surrounding the start of its Eurostar service as it announced that
it had won approval from the authorities to extend operations to the
weekend. The shares improved 3 per cent to FFr19.
AMSTERDAM saw Nedlloyd shares make further progress following the recent
wave of selling and ahead of expectations for strong third-quarter results
next week. The transport group's shares rose Fl 2.60 to Fl 54.80 while the
AEX index rose 4.72 to 403.87. Nedlloyd said yesterday that its shipping
division, together with Malaysian International Shipping was to take over
the French Compagnie Generale Maritime's share of Europe to Far East
shipping traffic from next month.
Philips was the day's most active issue, gaining 80 cents to Fl 52.50, with
third-quarter results due next week.
ZURICH's SMI index fell another 18.6 to 2,458.6. Mr Michael Clark of Robert
Fleming Securities said that the strength of the Swiss franc against the
dollar threatened painful currency translation effects on corporate
earnings; many of the country's multinationals had large portions of their
sales in the US currency, Switzerland itself offering a small domestic base.
In pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates tumbled SFr110 to SFr5,380. In banks,
the reduction in the UBS registered premium continued: this class fell SFr7
to SFr275 while the bearers fell SFr18 to SFr1,212.
One bright spot was the insurance sector, where Winterthur Insurance rose
SFr6 to SFr615 on bargain hunting; another was the watchmaker, SMH, which
recovered SFr6.50 to SFr157 after Goldman Sachs upgraded it to a trading buy
from market performer status.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers in advance of
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices rallied yesterday morning after five losing sessions in a
row, with a firmer bond market encouraging buying ahead of today's important
economic data, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 26.92 higher at 3,875.15, its best
level of the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained
3.23 at 465.84. Volume was heavy, with 329m shares traded on the Big Board.
In the other leading markets, the American SE composite was 1.56 better at
455.09, and the Nasdaq composite was up 4.23 at 767.47.
Bargain hunters were finally lured back into the market after five days in
which the Dow industrials retreated by about 88 points.
Early on, the advance was modest. Many investors were waiting until after
today's initial estimate of third-quarter economic growth before making
fresh commitments.
Most were resigned in the expectation that gross domestic product would come
in at 3 per cent, stronger than forecast a few weeks ago. Expectations of a
mid-November move by the Federal Reserve to lift rates again restrained any
genuine enthusiasm.
On a positive note, the Treasury market was showing half-hearted signs of
life, with traders squaring their positions ahead of the GDP data. The
gains, supported by slight improvement by the dollar against the yen and
D-Mark, were modest at best, but enough to provide a neutral backdrop for
stocks.
The day's only economic news was a dip in last week's initial claims for
unemployment benefit. Despite its inflationary implications, the
announcement was not particularly compelling when viewed in isolation.
In this vacuum, a fresh batch of earnings news provided some grist for the
mill, allowing most stocks to grind higher as the afternoon progressed. By
the end of the session, indices were showing impressive gains in a rebound
which was largely driven by technical factors.
Airline stocks were in demand, amid more signs that the US industry may have
turned a corner in the third quarter in its quest for financial stability.
UAL, parent of United Airlines, climbed Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 89, while
Delta Air Lines was marked up Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 49 1/4 , both on
better-than-expected performances. AMR, parent of American, added Dollars 1
7/8 to Dollars 52 3/4, having posted strong results earlier in the reporting
season.
By contrast, Dow Chemical added just Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 73 5/8, despite
third-quarter sales climbing to their second highest level in the company's
history, and net income of Dollars 1.04 a share being 25 per cent better
than Wall Street had anticipated.
Allied-Signal, a diversified industrial group, receded Dollars  1/8 to
Dollars 34 3/8 after matching the consensus forecast of 67 cents a share.
Xerox, down Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 102, suffered a setback even though its
results were much better than analysts had expected.
Pitney Bowes, the world's largest manufacturer of postal meters, dropped
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 . Its results statement included details of a
restructuring plan which would eliminate 2,000 jobs.
In banking, Citicorp gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 46 5/8 on a published
report which commented favourably on the stock's growth potential.

The overall index finished 28 higher at 5,735, the industrial index was 15
points better at 6,588 and the gold index was 18 points firmer at 2,298.
Brokers remarked that investors remained positive on gold stocks believing
that the price of bullion would move above the Dollars 400 an ounce level.
Industrials were also attractive at current levels, said one trader, given
that prospects for the economy remained encouraging.
The market shrugged off a rise in the inflation rate which came in around
forecasts, up to 10.1 per cent in the year to September from 9.4 per cent.
Gencor gained 40 cents to R15.00, Barlows picked up 70 cents to R32.70. In

FT  28 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Markets watch krona after Riksbank raises
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona was again in the spotlight yesterday after the central
bank's decision to lift interest rates by 20 basis points, writes Philip
Gawith.
The decision to raise the key repo rate to 7.4 per cent, which had been well
flagged, had a mixed reception, and the krona finished lower on the day. It
closed in London at SKr4.741 against the D-Mark from SKr4.723. The trading
range for the day was SKr4.7290-SKr4.7510.
Elsewhere, there were few surprises when the Bundesbank council decided to
leave its official rates unchanged - the discount rate at 4 1/2 per cent,
the Lombard rate at 6 per cent - and to fix the repo rate at 4.85 per cent
for a further two weeks.
The dollar had a quiet day ahead of today's closely watched third-quarter
GDP release. It closed in London at DM1.4972 and Y96.895, from DM1.4953 and
Y97.035. The US currency is now experiencing increasing difficulty breaking
above the DM1.50 level again.
Sterling rose by more than a pfennig to close at DM2.4519 from DM2.4412.
Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.6377 from Dollars 1.6326. The
trade weighted index finished at 80.8, up from 80.5.
The Riksbank last increased the repo rate, from 6.92 per cent to 7.2 per
cent, on August 11. A combination of surprise, and the announcement being
linked to currency weakness, then caused the market to sell the krona down
to SKr5, from SKr4.94.
The krona has recently been firmer, mainly as a result of market optimism
that the Swedes will vote 'yes' to joining the European Union in a
referendum on November 13. Signs that the government intends to rein in
spending have also helped the currency.
Contrary to the August move, when the market was not sure why rates were
being increased, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America
in London, said this time 'the justification for raising rates is certainly
there'. Capacity utilisation figures are on a rising trend, and producer
prices are growing at a 5 per cent year on year rate.
Mr Hawkins said the rate increase was potentially a double-edged sword,
because higher interest rates mean a higher interest bill for the
government, putting further strain on the public sector borrowing
requirement which the market is already worried about.
'The Swedish krona is going to have to go through a potentially protracted
period of undervaluation until the budget is addressed,' said Mr Hawkins.
Mr Peter Luxton, international economist at MMS, said the Riksbank's
decision, coming soon after its recomposition, was 'astute'. In Sweden, the
make-up of the central bank board reflects the distribution of political
power in the country. There had been some concern that with a social
democrat government replacing a more right-wing outgoing government,
monetary policy might be more lax.
Mr Luxton, however, said: 'This latest move reinforces the independence and
credibility of the Swedish central bank.'
Part of the 'Kiwi' dollar's strength is attributable to the firmer
Australian dollar which has been strong in recent days on the back of
interest rates being raised earlier this week.
The currency also has independent strength, however, as a result of buoyant
commodity prices, one of the best growth performances in the industrialised
world and a central bank with considerable market credibility.
The Reserve Bank last month raised the effective exchange rate index ceiling
to 60, up from 59.2 in March and 57.5 before that. The exchange rate is the
anchor of monetary policy and short-term interest rates are set at levels
consistent with these targets.
Lifting the index is an acknowledgement by the central bank of potential
price pressures, with an appreciation in the nominal exchange rate a way of
countering them.
Mr Hawkins said the stronger currency was probably in part due to the market
anticipating higher rates, in the wake of the Australian move.
Overnight money traded between 3 and 6 per cent as the Bank of England
cleared a Pounds 1.55bn daily shortage in the UK money markets. Three month
LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent.
In the futures market, prices firmed across the board following bullish
inflation comments from the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of
England. The March short sterling contract closed at 92.66, from 92.60.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway to close Statfjord
platform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says it plans to close one of
three platforms in the prolific North Sea Statfjord field by 2003 in a bid
to avert early closure of the entire field in 2007. This announcement comes
while several other oil companies are in the process of either closing or
planning to close platforms.
The Statfjord field comprises three fully integrated production/processing
platforms but the company says that by de-commissioning the A platform in
2003 the remaining B and C platforms could continue full operations beyond
the 2009. They would face closure in 2007 if the A platform remained in
operation beyond 2003 and the field's overall economics would, under this
scenario, deteriorate substantially.
'Compared with other options, this solution should boost the residual net
present value of the field by NKr1.64bn (Pounds 155m)in 1995 money, before
tax,' estimates Mr Morten Krogh, head of the team in charge of the
de-commissioning.
Statfjord's daily average production has reached 650,000 barrels, exceeding
the 1993 production plan for 600,000 barrels, but the rate will plunge to
about 26,000 barrels a day by 2009.
By the end of this year about 2.9bn barrels of the field's 30bn barrels of
recoverable reserves will have been extracted and output is expected to fall
to 25 per cent of today's level within five years.
The Statfjord A platform produces 170,000 b/d but processes 320,000 b/d,
175,000 barrels of which is derived from the adjacent Snorre field, operated
by Saga Petroleum. Processing of Snorre crude will have to be undertaken by
one of the other two Statfjord platforms when the A unit is closed.
According to Norway's field licensing arrangements, platform operators are
obliged to remove the massive structures from the field once production
ends. But the parliament has postponed discussion of a government White
Paper on platform removal guidelines until next spring, so it remains
unclear what platform abandonment requirements will be made of the oil
companies.
Production from the North East Frigg field ceased last year and work is
currently under way to close down the Odin field. In addition, the Frigg
field will soon end production as Phillips Petroleum completes plans for the
closure of several platforms in the Ekofisk field.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Policy changes clear way for
new fields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent changes to Norwegian oil policy have cleared the way for three new
North sea field developments for which more than NKr10bn will be invested to
boost domestic crude oil production.
Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, is seeking
approval to develop the NKr5bn (Pounds 470m), 180m-barrel Vigdis oil field
and for a NKr4.5bn extended development of the Snorre oil field, for which
the company has upgraded recoverable reserves to 1bn barrels from 717m.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, also plans to develop the tiny
(20m-barrel) Yme field in the southern part of North Sea.
Because fewer and smaller commercial oil discoveries have been made in
Norway in recent years the government is anxious to maintain a high level of
exploration activity, which could contribute to extending the duration of
peak oil production, expected to drop sharply in the next few years from a
current average daily production rate of 2.6m barrels.
The policy has been eased in an attempt to stimulate activity off Norway,
Europe's biggest oil producer, which faces stiff competition from regions
elsewhere in the world for oil company investment, which was set to plunge
next year from an average annual NKr30bn. In response the government has
scrapped the so-called sliding scale arrangement, which allows the state to
increase its direct shareholding in all licences that may contain
undiscovered resources and for all discoveries in the Barents Sea.
The top level of the sliding scale arrangement allows a direct state
interest of up to 75 per cent in fields and implies that the oil companies
have to cover a larger share of exploration costs than is indicated by their
shareholdings.
The policy changes also call for the state to relinquish rights to
participate in fields with less that 50m tonnes of oil equivalent assumed
discovered reserves.
The state will also consider reduction or disposal of its shareholdings in
small fields and for the 15th licensing round may decide not to participate
in new licences which are due to be awarded next year.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian claims aluminium
exports will fall this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian aluminium exports will fall from the record 2.1m in 1993 by between
200,000 and 300,000, according to Mr Igor Prokopov, president of Concern
Aluminiy, the co-ordinating organisation for the Russian industry.
Exports would continue to fall in 1995 but only slightly, he added, during a
briefing at the Alumitech '94 conference here.
Analysts greeted Mr Prokopov's prediction with some scepticism. Mr Stewart
Spector, of the Spector Report, pointed out that, according to the Russian
Foreign Economic Ministry, by the end of September aluminium exports already
had reached 1.65m tonnes compared with 1.26m in the same months of 1993. Mr
Prokopov's forecast suggested that in the final quarter Russian exports
would be about 60 per cent down from the corresponding period blast year.
Mr Prokopov said Russia had cut its annual aluminium production by about
300,000 tonnes since the international trade agreement was reached in
February by his country and Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway
and the US. Although Russia undertook to reduce output by 500,000 tonnes, Mr
Prokopov hinted that further cuts were unlikely because he said that 1995
production would be about the same as this year's.
He suggested that some 'adjustment' might be made to the terms to the trade
agreement when delegates from the six producing regions met again next month
in November. However he did not expect any move to re-start production
capacity recently shut down. Mr Prokopov said Russia's own consumption of
aluminium could not be expected to improve before the end of 1996 at the
very earliest.
He said Russia would be consuming three or four times as much aluminium in
packaging as it was at present, two or three times as much in transport and
twice as much in construction. This was not a forecast of what would happen
but only a 'wish list' for when the industry revived. It would not take much
capital to provide the extra products, just enough to modify some existing
plants.
Mr Prokopov said privatisation of the Russian aluminium smelters was
virtually completed and 'certain parties' including western trading
companies had built blocks of shares totalling between 20 and 30 per cent of
the capital of some smelters. He suggested that big western aluminium groups
eventually would regret not buying some of these shares. Western companies
were showing little interest in investing in the smelters in any way, he
said.
Analysts pointed out that this was understandable because, to attract risk
capital, Russia's political system had first to be stabilised and reliable
laws for the protection of investments introduced.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barbados seeks force majeure on
sugar for EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barbados is seeking to declare force majeure' on it sugar shipments to the
European Union because of the drought-hit island's inability to fulfil its
1994-95 quota. Because of the dry weather the 1995 harvest will yield less
than 40,000 tonnes of raws, according to Mr Rawle Eastmond, the agriculture
minister.
'Barbados will not be able to satisfy its sugar quota with the European
Union of approximately 54,000 tonnes, as production is projected to be
possibly below 40,000 tonnes,' he stated.
The government, which is raising USDollars 22.5m to restructure the
industry, is preparing to apply for force majeure under the relevant
provisions of the Sugar Protocol of the Lome trade and aid convention, the
minister said. If this application is accepted the Barbadian quota will not
be reduced in subsequent years.
Barbados produced 51,400 tonnes of sugar in the 1994 harvest, 5,000 less
than in 1993, according to official figures. The island has been unable to
fulfil its US quota of 7,500 tonnes of raws for 'several' years, because of
declining production, and is supporting proposals from its colleagues in the
Caribbean Community (Caricom) for a joint US sugar quota, Mr Eastmond said.
Caricom is seeking a combined quota from the US so that shortfalls by any
one member can be met by others within the group. 'If such a proposal is
agreed to by the US officials, then Barbados should still be able to benefit
from this quota system when we return to our production target of between
65,000 tonnes and 70,000 tonnes per year,' the agriculture minister said.
The money being raised for the financially troubled industry will come from
bonds floated by Citibank of Trinidad and Tobago, and from a loan from the
Caribbean Development Bank, said Mr Owen Arthur, the prime minister of
Barbados. He said the industry needed at least Dollars 30m.
The present restructuring of the sugar industry might well be the last, said
Mr Arthur. 'If this fails, the consequences could be dire.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The wool price rise continued and accelerated this week. Superfine merinos,
now coming up for auction more widely in Australia, met with good demand
from Italy, the leading world operator in this field. Prices for finer
merino fleece throughout the wool market recovery, now well over a year old,
have risen relatively more than other categories, and show no signs of
losing ground. With the wool market recovering healthily after a brief
setback towards the end of September, sales of Australian stockpile wool
have also improved, and the schedule fixed by the government is filled well
into 1995. Buying interest in the wool-using industry is not at present said
to be buoyant though steady business and good rates of activity continue.
The Australian Eastern states market indicator closed at 802 cents a kg,
compared with 762 a week ago.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese output surge seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China's aluminium production would grow by nearly 50 per cent by the year
2000, at which time it should have caught up with the country's booming
consumption of the metal, Mr Henglong Li, a director of the China National
Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation, said in Atlanta yesterday.
However China's production of alumina (aluminium oxide) would not be able to
keep pace with this growth and imports would continue at a high level. Last
year China produced 1.8m tonnes of alumina and imported 970,000 tonnes, said
Mr Li. In the first half of this year imports probably reached more than 1m
tonnes.
Speaking at Alumitech '94, Mr Li said China's aluminium output last year was
1.22m tonnes while consumption, after many years of growing at an annual
rate of 10 per cent, was 1.35m. He pointed out that to reach its production
target China would have to increase aluminium smelting capacity by about
100,000 tonnes a year until the year 2000.
Present firm plans included expanding annual capacity at the Qingtongxia
smelter from 100,000 tonnes to 220,000 and at the Baiyan smelter from 50,000
to 100,000. Mr Li said his group also hoped to build a new smelter with
annual capacity of 125,000 or 250,000 tonnes, together with a coal-fired
power station, at Shanxi.

<TEXT>
Jamaica's bauxite (aluminium ore) output grew to 8.77m tonnes in the first
nine months of this year, 5 per cent higher than in the corresponding 1993
period, mainly as a result of higher demand from refiners that have expanded
capacity.
Production of alumina (aluminium oxide) grew by 13 per cent to 2.44m tonnes
in the nine months.
The inland's largest refiner, Alumina Partners, is expanding its capacity
and is producing at a rate of 1.45m tonnes a year, against 1.2m tonnes in
1993, said Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, executive director of the Jamaica Bauxite
Institute. Other refiners have also increased their productivity, he said.
The institute is forecasting total bauxite ore production for this year at
12m tonnes, against actual production of 11.22m tonnes last year.

<TEXT>
Renison Goldfields, the Australian mining company in which Britain's Hanson
group holds a 40 per cent stake, has signed an exclusive agreement covering
exploration for titanium mineral deposits in Ukraine.
The agreement has been signed with Ukraine Joint Stock Company 'MFS', which,
in turn, has been authorised by the Ukrainian State Committee on Geology
(Goskom), to represent its interests in the development of deposits in the
area.
Certain tailing deposits, associated with existing Ukrainian heavy mineral
production operations, are also covered by the agreement. According to
Renison, these 'appear to contain commercial quantities and grades of
ilmenite'.
RGC, which started to look at the potential for developing Ukrainian mineral
sands last June, said there were 'a number of prospects, previously explored
by Goskom, which show the potential for large-scale commercial development'.
A drilling programme is scheduled to start in the December quarter.
News of the Ukrainian agreement came as Renison told shareholders at its
annual meeting that most of the company's operations had continued to trade
profitably in the current financial year - the exception being Renison Tin,
which had a production shortfall. Renison moved into the black in the second
half of 1993-94 after two years of losses.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (8): Facelift for an anniversary / A look
at preparations for Expo '98
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal has every right to be proud of its illustrious past, and the manner
in which it recalls events in its history that the rest of the world ignores
is nothing short of endearing.
Few outside Portugal, for example, are aware that 1991 was the 500th
anniversary of the first Portuguese mission to the kingdom of the Congo, or
that 2000 will mark the the 500th anniversary of the colonisation of Brazil,
or that this year celebrates the 600th anniversary of the birth of Prince
Henry the Navigator whose intellectual stimulus and deep pockets made such
milestones possible.
The world outside Portugal may, however, become aware of the significance of
1998 as the year marking 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's voyage to
India. If it does it will be because of Lisbon's Expo '98, an international
exposition which hopes to attract 115 participants, countries, multinational
companies and international organisations, and 10m visitors.
Expo '98, has chosen an attractive theme: under the title The Oceans, a
Heritage for the Future, it will focus on conserving the oceans and also on
realising the sustainable assets that the two thirds of planet earth
represented by the oceans can provide. The question is whether it can
deliver this appealing package.
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, a former EC commissioner and now commissioner for
Expo '98, brushes the doubters aside. The world fair will happen as planned
because much more than being an occasion to wave the Vasco da Gama flag,
more even than providing a platform for ecological correctness, Expo '98 is
the excuse for a significant urban facelift that Lisbon can no longer delay.
Already the state-owned Expo '98 consortium is beginning to decontaminate
and to level a 300-hectare industrial garbage area on Lisbon's eastern
suburbs, upriver and alongside the river Tagus estuary, that was formerly
occupied by a succession of petroleum refineries and factories.
It is an undertaking comparable to the renewal of London's Docklands or to
Barcelona's decision to uproot a similar rust belt to construct an Olympic
village. Mr Cardoso believes that Lisbon is not only 'fit to meet' such an
undertaking but 'desperately needs to do so'.
The stimulus is all-important. 'If the objectives are not foolish, if they
are reasonable, then societies need this sort of psychological challenge,'
says Expo '98's commissioner and his views echo those of Barcelona mayor
Pascual Maragall in the run up to the 1992 summer games.
Expo '98 will not, however, be a repeat of the Expo '92 jamboree in Seville
that marked the 500 years of Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the New
World. That was a 'universal' exposition, a higher rank than the
'international' exposition accolade awarded to Lisbon by the BIE, the
Paris-based organisation which monitors world fairs. With hindsight, Lisbon
perceives Expo '92 as having been too costly, too ambitious and, ultimately,
too wasteful.
'One of our main concerns is not to be Seville mark two,' says Mr Cardoso.
The Lisbon event will be shorter - four months, June to September, instead
of Seville's six - the exhibition space will be much smaller and, hopefully,
it will pay for itself by selling off its real estate to the private sector.
If all goes as Expo '98 plans it, Lisbon will be making a giant leap forward
over the next three years. It will acquire:
A second fixed link over the Tagus, a 15-kilometre six-lane highway thrown
across the estuary that will relieve pressure on the saturated existing
suspension bridge, down river, which dates from 1966.
A transport interchange centre serving buses, the city's metro system and
the main national railway traffic moving north-south and east towards the
Spanish border.
A big exhibition centre, a large multi-purpose indoor sports and music
stadium and the biggest oceanarium in Europe.
A new residential, office and commercial area, housing some 25,000 and,
scenically situated by the Tagus estuary's bulge, reminiscent in its
location of lakeside Chicago.
'Everybody has got his feelings at least a little mixed about such
ambitions,' says a Lisbon property developer. 'Clearing all that needs to be
cleared (the Expo '98 site extends along 5km of river front) and then
building all the complex things that are planned in under four years seems a
bit far-fetched.' The doubters point to the fact that Budapest has only
recently scrapped its own plans to have an Expo '96 because of time and
financing difficulties.
Mr Cardoso appears untroubled and he harks back to Vasco da Gama who was
'not a navigator' but a clear-sighted businessman. Getting to India was a
'trade-driven act' and by the same token the world fair on the 500th
anniversary of that voyage is a sound commercial venture moulded to the
city's requirements.
Indeed, Mr Cardoso seems intent on leaving nothing to chance as he preaches
the need to be 'hard, demanding and accurate' in the Expo '98 quest. He has
a poster of Murphy's Law - If things can go wrong they will - framed in his
office and he says that he has it hanging there to remind him and his staff
that 'everything has to be covered'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (9): New spirit of enterprise - Science
and technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal pioneered the application of science and technology to commercial
endeavour in the 15th century when Prince Henry the Navigator created the
School of Sagres. Leading astronomers, shipbuilders and cartographers were
challenged to make scientific breakthroughs that laid the technological
foundation for the Age of Discoveries.
Few such stimulating demands are made on Portuguese researchers today.
Industry, protected from competition and dependent on captive colonial
markets for most of this century, has made little effort to move beyond
unsophisticated, low-cost products. Scientists, lacking any challenge from
business, have turned to pure research or work for foreign companies with a
greater capacity to apply their findings.
The mistrust and misunderstanding that impair the relationship between
companies and universities in Portugal is a marked disadvantage for a
country now competing in a single European market, where technological
innovation is crucial for success. A few notably successful collaborations
between business and research institutes are exceptions that prove the rule.
Portugal invests only 0.8 per cent of GDP in research and development,
compared with a European Union average of 2.5 per cent. Little more than a
quarter of the total is invested in industrial research, compared with about
three-quarters for the most successful European economies.
Analysts have repeatedly highlighted the weak link between industry and
academia as a flaw in Portugal's strategy to build more competitive
companies. Efforts are now under way to rekindle the spirit of Sagres. The
most prominent development is Taguspark, a science and technology park due
to be completed in 1997. It will create an educational, scientific and
business community of about 10,000 people and involve a global investment of
some Es50bn (Dollars 321m).
The School of Sagres was the Renaissance equivalent of Cape Canaveral,
providing a scientific framework that helped launch Portugal into an era of
expansion and wealth. Taguspark has decidedly more modest aims, but
nonetheless hopes to build a bridge between science and enterprise that will
foster development.
'Our objective is to contribute to modernising Portugal by creating a new
framework for interaction between education, research and business and by
building an environment that favours innovation,' says Jose Sucena Paiva,
chairman of the Taguspark management board. Emphasis is being given to
providing support for technological development by the small and
medium-sized companies that dominate the economy.
The first stage of Taguspark, begun in 1992, will occupy 114 hectares
overlooking the Tagus river at Oeiras, a few minutes by road from central
Lisbon. Facilities will include a business and innovation centre, designed
as a small company incubator, as well as a scientific and technical
information centre, a congress and exhibition hall, a hotel, residential
areas and services.
Strong emphasis will be given to education. The Lisbon Technical University
(UTL), the Higher Technology Institute (IST) and the Systems and Computers
Engineering Institute (INESC) all plan to open faculties in Taguspark, which
will initially cater for about 3,000 university students.
Jose Tribolet, president of INESC, also wants the project to provide
secondary school teaching and short-term professional training courses,
which would make Portugal a pioneer in stimulating the practical application
of academic learning and research.
Large companies are also installing research and development centres in
Taguspark. The project's 19 shareholders, whose investments will be
supplemented by considerable amounts of EU and government aid, include the
state-owned power, telecommunication and post office utilities.
They have been joined by important private companies including Banco
Comercial Portugues, Banco Portugues de Investimento and the Inter-Banking
Services Society (SIBS), a European leader in automated banking services.
Many other companies, including foreign investors, are subsequently expected
to choose what promises to be a fertile new environment for the interchange
of ideas between science and industry as a launching pad for innovation.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (7): Neighbourly undertakings - Tom Burns
examines the change in the relationship with Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The economic relationship between Portugal and Spain is undergoing a
significant change. Cross-border trade and investment between the two
countries was once extremely limited, but it is now buoyant and, despite
Portugal's traditional nervousness about its big Spanish neighbour, it is
set to increase further.
'Before 1986 (the year when Portugal and Spain joined the then European
Community) it was as if Lisbon and Madrid were looking in opposite
directions,' says Miguel Athayde Marques, executive chairman of ICEP, the
government's trade and investment board. 'One of the most important
consequences of 1986 was the rapid integration of the two economies.'
Far from being back to back, the economies of Portugal and Spain are now
interacting with each other and are mutually benefiting as a result.
Inevitably Spain, with a GDP that is six times that of Portugal and a
population that is four times bigger, is setting the pace, but Portugal,
where per capita income is at best 75 per cent of that in Spain, is
gallantly holding its own.
Nobody is claiming that the Iberian peninsula forms a trading bloc similar
to that of Scandinavia, or that Portugal and Spain can be grouped together
as are the Benelux countries. There has been too much historical antagonism
for that, too many inferiority complexes on the part of the Portuguese and
an overdose of superior machismo on the part of Spain.
A merger between TAP and Iberia, the two national airlines, for example, is
ruled as 'quite out of the question', by a Lisbon official. 'Even if that
made economic sense, which it doesn't, it would be unthinkable because it is
a matter of national pride.'
Similarly, Portugal is anxious, as far as it is possible, to keep Spain at
arm's length in Portuguese-speaking nations such as Angola, Brazil and
Mozambique which Lisbon considers its natural stamping ground. Thus
Telefonica, the acquisitive Spanish telephone operator which is rapidly
building up a Latin American empire, could at best be a financial partner in
a Portuguese-run development of telecommunications in Angola.
Echoing a similar sentiment to the one expressed by the Spanish embassy in
Lisbon, a Portuguese diplomat said that 'mentalities are the hardest to
change'. Spaniards are viewed suspiciously by the Portuguese as over big,
over aggressive and, increasingly, as over here.
For all the self-evident reservations, the ice has nevertheless been broken
by the onset of European Union cash transfers, the volume of which can be
multiplied by the joint presentation of cross-border infrastructure
projects. The common EU umbrella has put the foundations for shared economic
strategies in place and it is gradually overcoming Portuguese misgivings.
It is precisely because of the shared EU membership that bilateral trade has
increased tenfold in the past decade. The value of Portuguese exports to
Spain which stood at Dollars 187.5m in 1983 was Dollars 1.9bn last year and
that of Spanish exports to Portugal has risen over the period from Dollars
429.6m to n.
Spain is now Portugal's principal foreign supplier and some 25 per cent of
all imports from the EU are Spanish. Spain has, in turn, become Portugal's
third market after Germany and France and it absorbs 19 per cent of exports
to the EU.
The remarkable feature of the trading relations between the neighbours is
the very large spread of similar items that are interchanged, and it is this
trade pattern which points to the integration of two economies that share a
common industrial profile based on small and medium companies.
The main Portuguese export to Spain is motor vehicles but this item
represents just 5 per cent of the total value of what Portugal supplies to
Spain. Likewise, motor vehicles are the leading Spanish export to Portugal,
representing 12 per cent of the overall value of exports, and the next two
export items represent 5 per cent and 3 per cent of the total value of
Spanish merchandise acquired by Portugal.
In the way that investment usually follows trade, the companies of both
countries are setting up branches across the border. 'The first place a
Spanish small company that wants to consolidate its export market thinks
about is Portugal,' says Luis Bonhomme of the Spanish Embassy in Lisbon.
'Portugal is what the Spanish entrepreneur knows best for it is the natural
extension of his own domestic market and exactly the same is true about
Spain for the Portuguese businessman.'
Again the figures show a remarkably rapid growth. Spanish investments in
Portugal Dollars 2m, scarcely totalled Dollars 21m in 1985, the year before
both countries became members of the EU, and they totalled Dollars 812m last
year, a year when Spain displaced the UK as the biggest direct investor in
Portugal and when 25 per cent of all Spain's foreign investment was directed
towards Portugal.
The story is a similar one on Lisbon's side of the border. Direct Portuguese
investment in Spain between 1991-1993 totalled Dollars 609m and it has gone
from representing 50 per cent of the total value Portuguese foreign
investment in 1991 to 78 per cent last year. Close to 60 per cent of the
value of the foreign business projects approved by ICEP, in a programme
aiding small and medium Portuguese companies to open up abroad, concern
direct investments in Spain.
Reflecting the wide spread of the trade pattern between the two economies,
and again underlining the economic integration between Portugal and Spain,
the cross-border investment flow is characterised by many companies making
comparatively minor outlays. There are some 2,500 Spanish companies in
Portugal but only 10 appear in the list of the top 500 companies in Portugal
and the biggest, the Cepsa energy group, is ranked 73rd.
There have been daring acquisitions from both sides of the frontier. Among
recent deals, Portugal's Cimpor cement company has bought a producer in
north-west Spain, Tafisa, Spain's leading fibre wood company, has been
purchased by Sonae, Portugal's biggest conglomerate, and the Colep packaging
business has acquired a sizeable unit in Spain, Johnson and Wax Espana.
The most ambitious cross-border Spanish moves have concerned the financial
sector and, in particular, the controversial Banesto assault on Banco Totta
e Acores, the profitable fourth-ranked domestic institution. The four main
Spanish banking groups are now all present in Portugal and together they are
estimated to control just over 17 per cent of Portuguese banking assets,
nearly 15 per cent of bank deposits and close to 16 per cent of banking
loans.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (6): Premier faces hard choice - Politics
/ A look at the prospects of parties in next year's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister since 1985, is facing one of
the most difficult decisions of his career. Before next summer he will have
to determine whether to stand again as prime minister in the October 1995
election or choose the easier but less-appealing option of running for the
presidency in 1996.
Mr Cavaco Silva readily acknowledges a taste for executive power and would
prefer the premiership to the president's limited role as political arbiter
and constitutional guardian. But he has a weak appetite for the constraints
of minority or coalition government. He is likely to run as prime minister
again only if convinced that his centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) can win
another overall majority.
Most analysts believe that a third consecutive majority will be within the
PSD's reach by mid-1995 enabling Mr Cavaco Silva to take the gamble. Given
the lack of a successor to match his electoral appeal or dominance of the
PSD, Mr Cavaco Silva will have to take into account that his own withdrawal
as a candidate for the premiership could mean the difference between
absolute victory, relative victory or defeat for his party.
After nine years in office, much of the original popularity of Mr Cavaco
Silva's government has been eroded. The pro-market reform drive of the early
years has lost momentum. The government is accused by left and right of
bestowing patronage and favouring political supporters. What the British
would call sleaze is undermining confidence in the public administration as
officials investigate several cases of alleged corruption.
But the root of the government's waning popularity is recession. Real wages
have fallen by more than three percentage points over the past two years
after three years of strong expansion and unemployment has increased by more
than two points to 6.8 per cent. Recent eruptions of anti-government
discontent, from attacks on trucks of imported Spanish fish to protests
against a bridge toll increase, are symptoms of underlying concerns about
jobs and living standards.
However, the economic cycle is evolving in Mr Cavaco Silva's favour, as it
has throughout his tenure as prime minister. Antonio Guterres, leader of the
opposition Socialist Party (PS), believes Portugal's economic recovery,
which began in mid-1994, will be too slow to have a strong impact on
disposable income before the election. But the government will undoubtedly
do everything possible to shape the pattern of growth. Some businesses say
public works and the application of European Union funds are being delayed
to maximise their influence on voters.
The PS is largely fighting the PSD on its own ground, promoting itself as
being more efficient at running a market economy. The party Socialists have
long left behind commitments to nationalisation and a high level of state
intervention. Mr Guterres has no complexes about not offering a radical
alternative. 'In a modern society, political ruptures generally lead to
disaster,' he says. 'Policy differences are today a question of degree.'
In fact, Portuguese parties tend to be more to the right than their names
indicate. Mr Guterres says his party represents a synthesis of traditional
European social democracy and a left-wing liberalism originating in the US.
The PSD has been described as 'liberal with an inclination towards social
solidarity'. Both parties are strongly committed to Europe and, with
different nuances, liberalisation of the economy.
Education is the priority issue for the PS. Portugal's education system is,
in the words of an independent foreign consultant, a 'national disgrace'. Mr
Guterres believes the government has wasted extensive EU funds in
professional training because no overall strategy or articulation with the
traditional education system was devised. More prosaically, the PSD asks how
the Socialists will fund their education plans.
On economic issues, the PS accuses Mr Cavaco Silva of engineering an
excessive appreciation of the escudo by imposing high interest rates. Mr
Guterres believes Portugal had the possibility of fostering higher growth
through lower interest rates without compromising nominal convergence with
the rest of the EU. He says that despite a tough exchange-rate policy, the
government has undermined convergence by allowing a large budgetary overrun
in 1993 and that the prime minister may now be prepared to let inflation and
public deficit targets slip in the approach to next year's election.
Dissatisfaction with the government is widespread and a recent opinion poll
put the PS ahead of the PSD. But the PS lacks unity and Mr Guterres's hold
over the party is not comparable with the prime minister's dominance of the
PSD. The Socialist leader is in a difficult position. For some voters he
lacks the proven technocratic prowess of Mr Cavaco Silva. For others, he
lacks the heart and emotion traditionally associated with the left in
Portugal. Several analysts believe he may be able to prevent Mr Cavaco Silva
from winning another overall majority but will fall short of his objective
of winning a clear majority for the PS.
One man who may not be sorry if no party gains an absolute majority is Mario
Soares, the president and a former Socialist leader. He has questioned
whether single-party majority governments are the most favourable for
Portugal. It was one of the provocative statements he appears to relish and
which are often interpreted as thinly-veiled attacks on the government. Mr
Soares is prevented by the constitution from standing for a third
consecutive term in 1996.
General Antonio Ramalho Eanes also served two consecutive terms as president
from 1976 to 1986. But he is now eligible to stand again and looks
increasingly likely to do so. He was a cornerstone of democracy in the
turbulent period that followed the 1974 revolution.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (4): Financial system on the move -
Banking / The emphasis is on greater efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A brightly-coloured van pulls into a remote village in northern Portugal and
a crowd gathers. A few years ago villagers would have been lining up to buy
household wares from a travelling salesman or to borrow a book from a mobile
library. Nowadays, they are checking on their investment portfolios.
The van, run by Banco Portugues do Atlantico (BPA), is a motorised bank
branch with a satellite dish on the roof that establishes a link with the
bank's computer systems. Customers who previously had to travel long
distances to the nearest branch now have regular access to a wide range of
banking services on their doorstep.
BPA's mobile branches beaming transactions through the sky are an indication
of how competition has intensified in Portuguese banking. In less than a
decade, the sector has been transformed by the opening of new banks, the
admission of foreign competitors and privatisation, propelling banks towards
greater efficiency and productivity.
Until the mid-1980s the financial system was heavily regulated and dominated
by state-owned banks. But liberalisation is steadily forcing banks to
compete on similar terms to their counterparts in most other European
countries, in terms of both market and regulatory conditions.
In particular, banks have been under pressure to reduce their financial
margins, the difference between the rate at which they raise funds and that
at which they lend to customers.
The average margin for Portuguese banks has fallen to about 3 per cent from
7 per cent in 1989. Miguel Namorado Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial
Portugues, calculates revenue from financial margins for the banking sector
at about Es600bn in 1994, Es100bn less than last year.
Because they enjoyed high margins, Portuguese banks have tended to waive
commissions and fees. Now tighter margins are compelling them to bolster
fee-based income. But, as Alexandre Vaz Pinto, vice-president of Banco
Espirito Santo (BES), points out: 'It's not easy charging higher prices in a
competitive market. Banks will have to be very imaginative in conciliating
service quality with competitive pricing.'
A joint attempt by banks to introduce a 1 per cent charge on purchases made
with direct debt cards in March this year stirred consumer associations to
organise a 24-hour boycott of bank cards. A parliamentary commission stepped
in and the charge was indefinitely suspended. Mr Vaz Pinto says the 'plastic
money' revolt taught banks the dangers of not paying sufficient attention to
customer relations.
Economic conditions have added to competitive pressures in squeezing bank
profitability. As a result of recession, credit to the private sector is
forecast to grow by 8.5 per cent this year, down from 13.3 per cent last
year. Non-performing loans are increasing as a proportion of total credit
and deposit growth has been virtually stagnant for the past two years.
Portuguese banks are estimated to have lost Es80bn as a result of this
year's drop in interest rates on government debt securities - although some
banks do not register these losses in their accounts.
'This year's combined loss of Es180bn from narrower margins and lower bond
revenue is equal to the sector's net profits in 1993,' says Mr Namorado
Rosa. The profits of most large banks are forecast to remain close to their
1993 level or show relatively small losses. The outlook for next year is a
little brighter and from 1996, the level of non-performing loans is expected
to stabilise. As economic recovery takes hold, credit growth is forecast to
make a strong contribution to profits.
BES, like several other banks, is investing in increased productivity. The
group, which expects to have 320 branches and 5,500 employees at the end of
1994, has reduced the number of workers per branch from 24 to 17 over the
past two years. But the banking system as a whole has an estimated 15,000 to
20,000 workers more than it needs to work efficiently.
The regulatory framework for banks in Portugal is also moving towards
European norms. From November 1, the compulsory cash reserve requirement
will be cut from 17 per cent to 2 per cent of customer liabilities. A
deposit guarantee fund will be in place by January 1995, some provision
requirements are being changed and banks are being compelled gradually to
cover their pension liabilities.
Banks are concerned about the additional costs these reforms could incur.
But Antonio de Sousa, governor of the bank of Portugal, is confident the
costs and benefits will cancel each other out in 1995 and that the balance
will evolve to the advantage of banks over the medium term. The estimated
Es2,200bn in liquidity to be released by the reduction of cash reserves will
initially be absorbed by certificates of deposit (CD) with maturities of two
to 13 years.
Banks will be able to use these CDs to make all of their 1995 contributions
to the deposit guarantee fund, says Mr de Sousa. Banks will initially
contribute a total of Es20bn to the fund and the Bank of Portugal an equal
amount. On the benefit side, Mr de Sousa says a planned reduction in the
level of provisions required to cover mortgage credit will be a substantial
advantage for banks. He also envisages extending the 1997 deadline for banks
to cover pension liabilities.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (3): Tough battle ahead to cut deficit -
The economy / Nominal convergence is a priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government, proud of what it considers
assiduous efforts to discipline the Portuguese economy, has been stung by
proposals for a variable-speed Europe.
'We don't like the idea of a two-track Europe,' Fernando Faria de Oliveira,
trade and tourism minister, told foreign bankers recently. 'Experience shows
that once you drop behind the pack, it's difficult to catch up again.'
The possibility raised in Germany and France that some European Union
countries could move towards monetary union ahead of others is almost
certain to strengthen Portugal's determination to try to achieve nominal
convergence - the lowering of inflation, budget deficits, public debt and
interest rates to meet the target for monetary union set by the European
Commission.
Mr Cavaco Silva gave an indication of his resolve on this issue in October
when he refused to agree to a trade union demand for a 5 per cent national
wage increase in 1995 as the starting point for a five-year social pact
between government, employers and unions. More indulgence would have been
understandable, considering the government's re-election next October is far
from assured.
But the prime minister drove the point home in a speech to trade unionists
immediately after the negotiations on a social accord collapsed. 'If we lose
the battle to reduce our budget deficit, Portugal will forfeit the political
weight required to defend its interests within the European Union,' he
warned.
Added to the risk of a multispeed Europe that would inevitably leave
Portugal behind the leaders, the government also has to consider that from
this year the provision of EU aid from the Cohesion Fund, to help poorer
member states catch up, is being linked directly to the attainment of budget
deficit targets as delineated by their convergence plans.
The budget deficit is the area of nominal convergence where Portugal faces
the most difficulty. Good progress was being made until 1993, when the
public sector borrowing requirement jumped to 7.2 per cent of GDP from 3.3
per cent the previous year. The onset of recession in the second half of
1992 contributed to the increase, but the main cause was a virtual breakdown
of the tax-collecting machine.
A deficit of 6.9 per cent of GDP was originally set for 1994, but higher
than expected tax revenue has enabled Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, to
cut this to 6.4 per cent. The budget for 1995 tables a deficit of 5.8 per
cent. This is based on forecast GDP growth of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent, up from
1.1 per cent this year, and average annual inflation of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent,
down from an expected 5.3 per cent in 1994.
'The 1995 deficit target is at the absolute top end of what is allowed under
Portugal's convergence programme,' says Sally Wilkinson, London-based
southern Europe economist with Union Bank of Switzerland. 'The government
could have set a lower target but, by being pessimistic, they are giving
themselves leeway either to outperform expectations or to grant an interim
pay award.' Such an award would be made shortly before the election.
Portugal is making more rapid progress in cutting inflation. The average
annual rate will have fallen by about 3.6 points in the two years to the end
of 1994, to 5.3 per cent. The year-on-year rate will then be about 4.5 per
cent, a 25-year low, and is already equal to that in Spain. The fall is due
to a relatively strong currency, depressing the inflationary component of
Portugal's high level of imports, combined with a cut in real disposable
income and depressed demand during the recession.
Miguel Namorado Rosa, an economist with Banco Comercial Portugues, is less
confident that the government's more optimistic inflation target for next
year can be met. An inflation rate of 3.5 per cent is virtually unknown in
Portugal and would be lower than that forecast for Spain. He sees stronger
domestic demand and wage rises placing increasing pressure on inflation,
with strains on industrial capacity beginning to be felt by 1996.
A stable escudo and falling inflation have enabled the central bank to begin
a cautious lowering of interest rates, an important factor in helping to
relaunch economic recovery. Overnight rates are about 170 basis points above
those in Spain although there is no longer an inflation differential.
Antonio de Sousa, governor of the Bank of Portugal, says the bank will
continue to be prudent in lowering money market rates, keeping exchange rate
stability as its priority.
'Reductions in interest rates have to be gradual and the market has to lead
the way not the central bank,' he says. 'Rates are at an historic low in
Portugal and moving downwards. The tendency is what is fundamental for the
competitiveness of companies.' Efforts are under way, he says, to improve
the financial reporting and accounting of the small and medium-sized
companies that dominate the Portuguese economy to reduce risk premiums on
bank loans and thus lower their financial costs.
Concern over nominal convergence is a political and face-saving issue for
governments as much as an economic one. Vitor Constancio, a former finance
minister and formerly leader of the opposition Socialist Party, believes
that, in economic terms, Portugal need not be overly concerned about the
targets. He considers the level of public debt, 67.3 per cent of GDP in
1993, and the budget deficit to be compatible with Portugal's long-term
effort to achieve real convergence, that is, to catch up with the output
level of the rest of Europe.
That effort will receive an important impetus in December when AutoEuropa, a
Es450bn joint-venture by Ford and Volkswagen, begins production of a new
multipurpose vehicle at a plant in Palmela, 30km south of Lisbon. Mr
Constancio estimates vehicles produced at the factory, which has directly
created 5,000 new jobs and perhaps double that number indirectly, will
account for about 20 per cent of Portugal's total manufactured exports,
representing 1 per cent or more of GDP.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (5): Action plan for business -
Industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You can always tell the pioneer in Portugal, he's the one with the arrows in
his back. This was one of the unofficial findings of an extensive study of
the Portuguese economy carried out under the direction of Michael Porter,
Harvard's leading professor of business strategy and national
competitiveness.
Mr Porter's consulting company, Monitor, was sponsored by 47 of Portugal's
top companies to spend a year investigating the country's economic strengths
and weaknesses and to draw up a strategy for building competitiveness. One
conclusion of the hefty report, produced earlier this year, is that Portugal
needs action more than reports.
Other findings by Monitor, which mobilised 500 people for the investigation
throughout 1993, overturn long-held consensus views on Portugal's problems
and how to overcome them. If Mr Porter's assessment that anti-individualism
is hampering progress is correct, business leaders who are already beginning
to act on his proposals will find their backs becoming extremely sore.
Brushing management jargon aside, Monitor investigators describe the
hierarchies and bureaucracies they believe are obstructing Portugal's
development as a 'cover your ass' attitude. Attitudes have been moulded by a
long history of autocratic rulers, they say, from the despotism of the
Marquis of Pombal in the 18th century through Salazar to a brief flirtation
with a dictatorship of the proletariat following the 1974 revolution.
Government in Portugal is still too big and powerful, argues Monitor, saying
that the state's capacity to bestow patronage through the allocation of
European Union funds serves to strengthen autocratic tendencies. Fearing
reproof, the Portuguese shy away from individual initiative and take refuge
in committees and red tape. People at the top of companies or civil service
departments become out of touch because those lower down are reluctant to
approach them.
Because of this emphasis on government and institutions, Portugal tends to
'look for supply-side rather than demand-driven reforms'. According to Ian
Smith, managing director of Monitor's European division: 'The result is a
tendency to distribute capital that no one knows how to use, to build
laboratories that conduct experiments that no one wants, or to plant trees
that burn down because farmers have no incentive to care for them.'
Portugal may be relieved to know it is not alone. Monitor believes the World
Bank and the European Union commit the same sort of mistakes. The message
that Mr Porter wants to get across is that individuals, not institutions,
create change. His tenet that 'firms compete not nations' has particular
relevance to Portugal, the report concludes.
Portugal gives too much emphasis to macro-economic issues such as
exchange-rate policy and financial markets, it finds, but neglects the
concrete concerns of individual companies. 'That is like a tennis player
watching the scoreboard instead of the ball,' says Mr Smith. Macro-economic
policies are important but insufficient in themselves to improve living
standards, says Monitor. Too much concern with them implies overlooking the
need for business to 'achieve superior satisfaction of consumer needs, cost
effectively'.
The report challenges as 'deeply flawed' views long cherished by many
Portuguese politicians and economists: the view that the country needs to
build high-tech industries such as robotics, computers and biotechnology;
that resources should be directed to sectors chosen as strategic; that big
companies should be fostered as engines of growth; and, particularly, that
the economy is dependent on too narrow a group of industries, such as
agriculture and traditional products, mainly textiles and footwear.
Monitor advises Portugal to focus on seven 'clusters' - groups of
interconnected industries - which it identifies as: material and metals,
forest products, petroleum and chemicals, transportation, food and
beverages, housing and household goods, textiles and apparel, and tourism.
These sectors already account for almost 90 per cent of exports and,
according to Mr Porter's team, represent important strengths on which
Portugal can build.
The finding that Portugal's future lies in its traditional industries has
provoked criticism that the Monitor team mobilised vast resources - and
received a large fee - only to arrive at a conclusion that is plain common
sense. Mr Smith replies that few people were talking common sense before the
report came out but were discussing moving into sectors such as sub-micro
technology, automobiles and jet fighters. 'We believe we have changed the
debate for the better.'
The government has welcomed Monitor's contribution to economic discussion.
But the report has received a warmer response from the opposition Socialist
Party (PS). 'Michael Porter has made a reasonable diagnosis of Portugal's
problems and put forward positive proposals for the future,' says Antonio
Guterres, the PS leader. He says the government, on the other hand, has
sought to devalue the report.
Monitor gives Portugal eight imperatives for becoming more competitive and
suggests ways to implement them. The recommendations are: focus on
sophisticated and demanding customers; formulate a competitive strategy;
increase productivity; co-operate with suppliers, distribution channels and
customers; create representative associations; build a home base; develop a
civil society; and invest in human capital.
The largest section of the report is on how to mobilise people to work for
change. Concerned that its efforts may be blighted by bureaucracy, Monitor
has left behind a network of task forces that are already beginning to
challenge existing policies. 'Portugal has a lot of very good people,' says
Mr Smith, 'It's up them to pick up these ideas and run with them.' They may
have to dodge a few arrows on the way.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (1): Europe's reluctant tiger - The
belief among economists that Portugal could do better reflects a feeling
that the government has lost its nerve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is weighing itself in the balance as it prepares to enter its 10th
year as a member of the European Union and to mark a decade of centre-right
government under Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. The prevailing judgment
is that reasonable expectations have not been frustrated, but neither have
dreams been fulfilled.
Gross domestic product per capita grew from 51.4 per cent of the EU average
in 1985 to 64.5 per cent at the end of last year. In the decade to the end
of 1995, Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, estimates the economy will have
expanded at an average of 3.17 per cent a year, compared with 2.29 per cent
for the EU and - an important comparison for Portugal - 2.75 per cent for
Spain.
In effect, Portugal has been catching up with the rest of Europe at a rate
of 0.88 per cent a year above the average European growth rate since it
joined the EU. That represents the strongest era of growth in Portugal's
modern history and compares with a 3.2 per cent decline in GDP per capita
over the previous decade, a period marked by the overthrow of the Salazar
dictatorship in 1974 and several years of revolutionary upheaval.
At its present rate of growth, Portugal will take another 40 years to reach
the average economic strength of its EU partners, not allowing for the
adjustments to be made after the admission of new member states. From an
historical perspective, this seems like reasonable progress.
The hopes raised in Portugal a decade ago that the country would be enjoying
living standards comparable with those of most other Europeans by 2000 have
since been written off as wholly unrealistic. But were these hopes
unrealistic? Some economists believe Portugal may be missing a unique
opportunity to attain growth rates of 5, 6 or even 7 per cent a year -
becoming a sort of European tiger.
'There is no reason why we should not achieve rates of growth similar to
those in certain parts of Asia,' says Antonio Borges, a former
deputy-governor of the Bank of Portugal and now dean of Insead, the business
school near Paris. 'All the favourable conditions that we see in such
fast-growing, emerging countries are also to be found in Portugal.'
These conditions include an open economy benefiting from access to the
European market and a high level of public and private investment. Portugal
is to benefit from at least Es4,450bn in EU aid over the next six years,
more than double the funds received from Brussels in the previous six years.
Portugal suffers no balance-of-payments difficulties and enjoys a high level
of savings and investment. Above all, the labour market is flexible to a
degree that 'would be the dream of most other European countries', according
to Mr Borges. Given these advantages, he and like-minded analysts ask why
Portugal has been satisfied with rates of growth not much different from
those in the rest of Europe.
The reason, according to analysts, is an economic policy often directed at
guaranteeing the survival of inefficient companies and sectors, even though
this slows down long-term growth and restricts economic development to the
pace of the slowest movers. EU funds, they say, are frequently applied to
maintaining a status quo already proven to be inadequate. As examples, they
point to the troubled agricultural sector, to a Es180bn aid package for the
loss-making state airline TAP and to large subsidies for the ailing
state-owned steel company Siderurgia Nacional.
The conviction held by several economists that Portugal could do better
reflects a more prevalent sentiment that Mr Cavaco Silva's government has
lost the reforming zeal of its early years - when important economic and
legislative advances were made - and has grown steadily more averse to risk
and conservative.
A view widespread in the business community is that the governing Social
Democrats (PSD) have lost their nerve and are not prepared to accept the
political discomfort that more radical industrial restructuring, resulting
in an economic leap forward, would involve.
Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialists (PS), has a harsher
view of what he perceives to be the government's deficiencies. 'The PSD has
created a vast network of clients, partly through the way it distributes EU
funds and other subsidies,' he says. 'The government intervenes in the
economy in the interests of these clients, who are political supporters,
rather than on the basis of clear policies.'
The accusation, not unfamiliar in other countries, is echoed by smaller
opposition parties to the left and right. As evidence, critics point to the
government's recent veto of a hostile bid by Banco Comercial Portugues, the
fifth largest bank, for control of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, the second
biggest, and to the possible closing of hypermarkets on Sunday afternoons to
defend small shopkeepers.
In a recent speech, Mr Cavaco Silva dismissed his political opponents as
'prophets of doom' and 'defeatists'. He said the government's decision not
to agree to trade union demands for a 5 per cent wage increase in 1995, an
election year, showed he was prepared to sacrifice short-term political
interests for the long-term good of the country. He defends the PSD as a
pragmatic party that gets things done, while the opposition is limited to
rhetoric.
Opposition voices, rhetorical or otherwise, have grown louder over the past
two years, mainly as a result of recession. A period of negative growth from
mid-1992 to mid-1994 abruptly ended the euphoria Portugal enjoyed in the
late 1980s. Competition within the single European market and reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy have exposed Portugal to less benevolent aspects
of EU membership than previously experienced.
Recent eruptions of discontent - from the blockading of the April 25 bridge
in Lisbon because of a toll increase to the blocking of a train importing
Italian milk - have their root in economic concerns caused by the recession.
The flagging economy has also drawn attention to issues less closely
examined during the boom years, such as rural poverty, illiteracy, child
labour, slums, shanty towns and deficient education and health services.
The recession has made a strong impact in Portugal, but by international
standards was relatively mild. GDP fell by 1 per cent in 1993 but growth has
already resumed and will reach 1.1 per cent this year and a forecast 2.5 to
3.5 per cent in 1995. Unemployment has risen but is still low at 6.8 per
cent. There has been no devastating impact on the financial sector, no
property crisis, no wave of bankruptcies. Business confidence is weak but
recovering.
In this climate, Portugal's medium-term objective is to secure full
participation in the EU's plans for economic and monetary union,
particularly now that the community is expanding and the possibility of a
multispeed Europe has been raised by politicians in Germany and France. An
election next October will decide who leads the country towards that goal.
Mr Cavaco Silva may have lost some support. But it is not clear that Mr
Guterres has yet gained enough credibility to replace him.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel seeks approval to apply
for banking licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cedel, the international clearing and settlement organisation, is urging the
nearly 100 banks who own it to allow it to apply for a Luxembourg banking
licence in order to compete head-on with Morgan Guaranty's Euroclear system.
The move has been prompted by the Basle agreement on international bank
capital adequacy rules, which require deposits against unsettled trades held
at a corporation such as Cedel to carry a 100 per cent risk weighting.
However, settlement deposits at Euroclear, which has a banking licence
through Morgan Guaranty, carry a 20 per cent risk capital weighting, making
it much cheaper to use for international securities clearing and settlement.
Until now, Cedel has been reluctant to apply for a banking licence, partly
out of concern at some of its shareholders that it could become their
competitor.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Kepco lists Dollars 300m of
ADRs in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Korea Electric Power has become the country's second company to list on the
New York Stock Exchange, raising about Dollars 300m in a global equity
offering of 14.9m American depositary shares.
The move by Korea's biggest company by capitalisation further signals a
trend by Asian and Latin American companies to raise capital through ADSs or
global depositary receipts - paper which represents underlying shares.
Kepco issued 14,906,832 ADSs in its offer, which was co-ordinated by Lehman
Brothers. They were priced at Dollars 20 1/8 , a premium of 5 per cent over
the last local share price, but fell to Dollars 19 3/4 in early trading.
Each ADS represents two common shares.
Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company (Posco), the world's second largest steelmaker,
was the first Korean company to issue ADSs when it raised about Dollars 300m
in New York earlier this month. Korean companies were recently given
permission by the government to list their shares in New York, London and
Tokyo.
Korean companies have been active in the GDR market, with seven issuing
Dollars 473.9m in GDRs this year (compared with three issuing Dollars 328.2m
in 1993), according to figures produced by Euromoney Bondware.
Total GDR issues by Hungarian, Turkish and a range of Asian and Latin
American companies have amounted to more than Dollars 5.5bn compared with
Dollars 2.1bn in 1993, according to the same source. Indian companies have
topped the league of GDR issuance this year, raising about Dollars 2.39bn.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Longer-dated Treasuries stage advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Longer-dated US Treasury bonds staged a modest advance yesterday ahead of
today's data on economic growth, suggesting the market had already factored
an unfavourable reading into bond prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/16 better
at 93 13/16 , with the yield at 8.043 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 6.875 per cent.
The slight advance across the board was not a reflection of any fundamental
shift in sentiment. The tone remained marginally negative, with most traders
merely squaring their positions ahead of the advance estimate of gross
domestic product in the three months to the end of September. Few were
willing to make big commitments beforehand, even though many believe the
market has established a bottom.
Most economists have already revised upwards their forecasts. The consensus
view sees growth at 3 per cent during the quarter, as weaker initial
forecasts have fallen victim to the series of stronger than expected
economic indicators in recent weeks. Few doubt that the Federal Reserve is
poised to lift short-term interest rates again.
For the same reasons, bond yields had climbed to their highest levels in 2
1/2 years. With the return on the long bond hovering above 8 per cent all
week, buyers finally reappeared yesterday, though the activity was
restrained, at best.
Improvement in the dollar against the yen and D-Mark was a help, as was the
willingness of traders to ignore a mildly discouraging economic report.
Initial claims for unemployment benefit showed a small dip last week,
against expectations of a slight gain.
At the short end, uncertainty over the aggressiveness of the Fed's expected
move after the November elections held back activity. Today's GDP data may
provide a clue on the size of the next rate increase.
European government bonds extended their early gains in late trading,
supported by firmer US Treasuries and lifted by a break of key resistance on
the German bund futures contract.
However, market participants remained nervous ahead of today's release of US
GDP data, and dealers said investor participation was minimal, with most of
the activity taking place in the futures pits.
UK gilts rallied by about a point, strongly out-performing German bunds. The
December long gilt future on Liffe ended the day around 100 1/4 , up  15/16
. The 10-year gilt yield spread over bunds narrowed to 133 from 142 basis
points on Wednesday.
In large part, gilts were lifted by comments from Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer, who said that UK interest rates would not have
to rise much if a tight fiscal policy was maintained.
'This may be a hint that the (November 29) Budget will be comparatively
tight,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts analyst at ABN Amro Hoare Govett.
The market was also relieved by ebbing supply concerns after Wednesday's
gilt auction, which has left the funding pipeline clear of supply until
December.
A stronger currency also supported gilts and encouraged some foreign buying.
Dealers reported overseas purchases in seven to 10-year maturities, while
domestic investors were said to have been moving into longer maturities.
German bonds rose by more than  1/2 point in largely technical dealings.
Early in the day, prices rose on hopes that the Bundesbank might revert to
variable-rate securities repurchase agreements from the current regime of
fixed-rate repos, which was seen to pave the way for lower short-term rates.
Although the Bundesbank's Council at its meeting yesterday left interest
rates unchanged and announced two more weeks of fixed-rate repos at an
unchanged 4.85 per cent, the market held on to its gains.
In the afternoon, slightly firmer US Treasuries helped the December bund
future breach key resistance at 89.00; it closed around its day's high of
89.25, up 0.62.
Europe's high-yielders continued their recent rally. Italy again
out-performed Germany, its yield spread over bunds narrowing to 422 from 437
basis points on Wednesday; Sweden's yield gap remained steady around 315
basis points.
Swedish bonds were lifted by the Riksbank's 20 basis point increase in the
repo rate to 7.40 per cent, seen as a credibility-bolstering move by the
newly-appointed central bank council.
Italian bonds rallied on Wednesday's cabinet agreement on amendments to
pension reform, the nomination of Mr Vincenzo Desario as central bank deputy
governor and buying by domestic investors.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Fleming recruits equity
strategy team from rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockbroker Robert Fleming and Co has recruited a highly successful equity
strategy team from competitors Credit Lyonnais Laing, which is threatening
legal action if the team develops a competing product for Fleming.
Mr Michael Cardinene, chief executive at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said his
firm had bought a company from the three team members and signed a
three-year service contract with them in January 1992.
'The critical point of the purchase and sale agreement is that they are
banned from developing the product for anyone else,' he said. 'If they
violate the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, then we will bring
legal action.' Exactly what the team can do for a new employer 'will be a
matter for the lawyers'.
Late yesterday, Robert Fleming declined to comment on what the team's duties
were expected to be.
The prospect of a row between the firms illustrates the fiercely competitive
environment for UK stockbroking firms. According to the 1994 version of the
Greenwich Survey, Credit Lyonnais Laing is ranked in the top 10 stockbroking
firms in terms of market penetration, with 3 per cent of the 135 respondents
listing it as their firm of first choice. Fleming is not rated among the top
10 in that category.
The team, Mr Richard Clark, Ms Helen Bond and Mr Chris Chaitow, had
developed a 'Momentum and Value' product based on a historical data base of
stock and econometric information. Mr Cardinene said the product had been a
key factor in Credit Lyonnais Laing's ability to gain market share. He said
Credit Lyonnais Laing owns the data bases and retains additional members of
the team, so it can continue to offer the product to clients.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Trans-Tokyo Bay offer sees strong
demand

<TEXT>
The euromarkets saw a paucity of issues yesterday as borrowers stood on the
sidelines awaiting the reaction to today's figures on GDP from the US.
The main deal of the day was Trans-Tokyo Bay Highway Corp, which brought a
Dollars 200m, 10-year deal with a 8 3/8 per cent coupon via Bank of Tokyo
Capital Markets.
A syndicate manager said demand for the deal was far stronger than expected.
'This is a hot issue,' he said, with sales to institutions in Asia and
Europe.
Yesterday's deal came at 38 basis points over the comparable Treasury, and
did not move when freed to trade, said BoT. Other syndicates said the deal
was fairly priced.
Bayerische Hypobank brought a ADollars 75m, three-year deal with a 9 3/4 per
cent coupon which lead-manager Hambros said met retail demand in Europe.
This was Hambros' 31st deal this year in the Australian dollar sector, and
Bayerische Hypobank's second. Its first deal came in August with an 8 3/4
per cent coupon and by yesterday had tightened in by 35 basis points, said
Hambros.
Deutsche Bank Finance brought a Dollars 200m deal with a 7.5 per cent coupon
and a 39-month maturity. There was an excellent response from other
syndicates, said lead manager Deutsche Bank, which brought this deal after
seeing good demand for the three-year tranche of the Johnson &amp; Johnson deal
this week.
Dresdner International Finance opted for ABN-Amro Bank to handle its first
visit this year to the euromarkets with a Fl 250m, five-year offer.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Samsung consolidation cuts units
to 24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Samsung, South Korea's biggest conglomerate, yesterday said it would
consolidate its operations by cutting the number of its subsidiaries to 24
from 50 through mergers and disposals. It is the third large-scale
reorganisation to be announced by Samsung in the last three years.
The latest shake-up follows the introduction of management reforms last year
to promote autonomy among the group's main business areas, including
electronics, machinery, chemicals, and trade and finance.
The reorganisation signals the group's intention to focus on these core
industries and rationalise their operations. But some analysts said the
consolidation hardly represented a significant change in the group's
corporate structure, since many of the subsidiaries to be sold are of minor
importance to Samsung's operations.
Moreover, domestic investors fear the planned mergers among some of
Samsung's main subsidiaries could depress profits for the enlarged units.
Share prices for 11 of Samsung's 12 listed affiliates fell sharply after the
reorganisation was announced. Only the Samsung Aerospace share price
increased, due to the perceived benefits from its merger with Samsung Heavy
Industries, a manufacturer of ships and trucks.
The corporate restructuring may have as much a political purpose as a
business one, as Samsung tries to curry favour with the government and win
its approval for the group's plans to enter the passenger car industry.
Samsung claims the reorganisation meets many of the government's goals for
the reform of Korea's leading conglomerates, including business
specialisation and the dilution of ownership by the group's founding family.
Ten subsidiaries will be merged. Samsung Corporation, the group's trading
arm, will take over several construction units, including Samsung
Engineering and Construction, Samsung Engineering and Samtech, and Cheil
Industries, the textile company.
Samsung Heavy Industries, which specialises in transport equipment and
construction machinery, will absorb Samsung Aerospace, Samsung Forklift and
Samsung Kloeckner Machinery. The recently-acquired Korea Fertiliser and
Chemicals will be merged with Samsung General Chemicals, the petrochemicals
unit.
The property group Joong-ang Development will take over Yonpo Leisure, while
Kwangjoo Electronics becomes part of Samsung Electronics.
Samsung Watch will change its name to Samsung Precision, with semi-conductor
manufacturing equipment to be added to its activities.
Sixteen subsidiaries, which are mainly in the labour-intensive textile, food
and service sectors, will be sold because their profitability is being
eroded by higher wage costs.
The companies to be sold include Cheil Food &amp; Chemicals, Cheil Synthetics,
Hicreation, Cheil-Bozell Advertising, Daekyung Building, Korea-Alaska
Development, Cheil Frozen Food, Chosun Hotel, Taejon Station Business and
Cheil Futures.
Others companies that will be spun off include Samsung Emerson and Korea
Information Group in electronics, and Shin-etsu-silicone Korea, Cheil
Ciba-Geigy and Daehan Precision in chemicals. The Joong-ang Daily News, one
of the country's main newspapers, will also be sold by 2000.
Although the sale of these units will reduce the group's annual sales by
Won3,000bn to Won40,000bn (Dollars 50bn), based on last year's sales
performance, they could help raise funds for the Samsung car project, which
is expected to cost at least Dollars 5bn.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: New World Development profits
rise 24% to HKDollars 4.3bn for year

<TEXT>
New World Development, the Hong Kong property, hotels and infrastructure
group, yesterday reported a 24 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars
4.3bn (USDollars 558m), from HKDollars 3.5bn, for the year to June 30. The
results were broadly in line with market forecasts.
Gross income from property sales last year totalled HKDollars 6.3bn, a 31
per cent improvement over the previous year. However, rental income edged up
8.5 per cent to HKDollars 1.4bn from HKDollars 1.3bn.
On a fully diluted basis, earnings per share rose 18 per cent to HKDollars
2.57 from HKDollars 2.17 the previous year.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of 78 cents, up from 62
cents the previous year, to be paid in scrip or cash.
The group has 17 projects in the pipeline, which will provide New World with
a total entitlement of about 572,997 sq metres upon completion with about
92,350sq m to be completed before the end of the financial year.
New World boasts one of the biggest landbanks in China among the Hong Kong
property developers, and believes this will allow it to benefit from reforms
and economic development across the border.
In Hong Kong, where government measures and bank curbs on mortgage lending
have depressed property prices, the group is equally confident of its
prospects.
Mr Henry Cheng, managing director, said consolidations would nurture a
healthier and more stable environment for future property development. 'The
fundamental factor supporting long-term growth in property value has
remained unchanged with the facts that the demand far exceeds supply,' he
said.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chinese cling to share
rollercoaster - Market gyrations are not helping confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An official in Beijing responsible for regulating the stock market was this
week reported to have said that recent market turmoil was 'tugging at the
hearts of hundreds of millions of Chinese'.
Something of an exaggeration perhaps, but share indices have been rising and
falling 5 per cent to 10 per cent almost daily in recent months, and such
volatility in China's infant markets is hardly engendering confidence among
investors.
The Shanghai index for A-shares (reserved for local investors) hit a
low-point of 328.85 on July 29, prompting panicky government intervention to
halt the slide.
The market then jumped to a heady peak of 1,057.31 on September 12 before
subsiding like a punctured balloon, to fall by about 40 per cent in ensuing
days. Yesterday, it finished at 703.72, compared with 686.31 the day before.
One factor creating the market's gyrations are continuing rumours about the
health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader. The Shanghai market
plummeted by about 40 per cent earlier this month on reports that Mr Deng
was near death, before recovering most of the lost ground after an official
denial.
Mr John Crossman of Jardine Fleming brokers in Shanghai likens the Shanghai
A-share market to a casino. 'It is completely driven by small local
investors trying to guess what the big investors (local securities houses)
are doing and vice versa.'
Mr Crossman believes the A-share index will bounce between 500-800 until
liquidity improves. He notes that while the market capitalisation of A-share
companies is about UDollars 40bn, only about UDollars 8.1bn of stock is
tradeable.
These are shares held by individual investors, and amount to about one-third
of a listed companies' shares. The remainder are vested in the state or held
by so-called 'legal persons', such as institutions, corporations and
quasi-government bodies.
The August jump in China's fledgling stock markets followed a government
announcement that it was suspending all new listings. It also said it was
considering allowing the establishment of joint venture security houses to
trade in A-shares.
This announcement galvanised a market starved of positive news, but it seems
the benefits of government intervention are diminishing in the absence of
further developments. 'They ramped the (A-share) market to unsustainable
levels, but now it's run out of juice,' says Mr Crossman.
Western stock analysts in Shanghai say among problems facing the A-share
market is the lack of supply of newly-listed stock. They believe it was a
mistake for the authorities to halt new listings.
Instead, they say, the government should have announced a schedule for
newly-listed stock, which would have provided a clear guide to the future
instead of the previous haphazard approach which gave no real guidance of
the timing of new issues.
The Shanghai Securities News reported an (unnamed) official of the
Securities Commission in Beijing, one of several securities regulatory
bodies under State Council or cabinet, as saying the authorities were
investigating the establishment 'as soon as possible' of investment funds to
stabilise the market.
Chinese officials have been trumpeting the need for mutual-type funds to
bring weight to the market. However, such a development is being held up
because of delays in promulgating a new National Securities Law. After going
through multiple drafts, the measure is lodged with the standing committee
of the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
Small closed-end funds are active in China's markets, but these can hardly
be said to contribute to stability since they are speculative vehicles.
About 70 of these funds are operating in the Shanghai market.
While the behaviour of A-shares has been marked by extreme volatility,
B-shares, traded in US and Hong Kong dollars, are languishing, with the
index finishing yesterday at 77.28, little changed from the day before.
Mr Richard Graham, chief representative in Shanghai of Baring Securities,
said managers of China funds were preoccupied with negative economic news
from China, including bad inflation figures. An adverse tax ruling denying
foreign invested companies tax rebates had also depressed sentiment. 'Fund
managers these days are looking at actual earnings growth,' he said.
Local Chinese investors appear to have paused in their purchases of
B-shares. With the stabilisation of the yuan (the local currency has
appreciated this year against the US dollar), there is much less incentive
for locals to dabble in B-shares.
Among the few bright spots has been the increased activity of Japanese
securities houses, following the Japanese share dealers' association's
decision in March to allow investments in the Shanghai market.
Increased, albeit cautious, Japanese activity is reflected in the increasing
share of trading in the B-share market of Japanese securities houses, with
Nomura leading the way.
Western analysts in Shanghai expect the B-share market to continue to be
subdued for the rest of the year and predictions that the B-index would
reach 100 by the end of the year have been set aside.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: ANA drops 79% despite increase
in traffic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All Nippon Airways (ANA) reported a sharp drop in recurring profits, before
extraordinary items and tax, for the first half of the year, in spite of a
moderate recovery in passenger volumes.
The recurring profits declined 79 per cent to Y1.19bn (Dollars 12.2m) from
Y5.66bn a year ago, as revenues slipped slightly to Y401.6bn from Y404.4bn.
Net income fell 40 per cent to Y798m from Y1.34bn last time.
ANA, Japan's second biggest airline, said Japanese travellers were returning
to the market, but the benefits had been overshadowed by a sharp decline in
prices. 'We are seeing increases in passengers but with the rampant price
sensitivity it hasn't helped our revenues much,' the company said.
The yen's strong appreciation lured Japanese passengers back on to
international routes, where passenger numbers were up 5 per cent, ANA said.
European routes, in particular, did well.
However, revenues from international routes were up only 3 per cent. If
prices had not fallen, ANA would have added Y800m to passenger revenues of
Y2.4bn in the period.
On domestic routes, passenger numbers were up only 1.8 per cent.
'With Japan's economy showing signs of recovery, the prolonged downward
trend in air travel demand appears to have bottomed out,' ANA said. Business
class appears to be recovering, particularly on European and North American
routes.
ANA initiated a restructuring plan in February to cut costs by about Y6bn
and increase revenues by about Y20bn by March next year. The plan includes a
10 per cent cut in its workforce through natural attrition and cuts in
controllable costs.
In the first half of the year, the company has been able to cut operating
costs by Y600m. It has started to hire cabin crew on a contract basis in a
programme that is being adopted by Japan's troubled airlines and which
caused substantial controversy this summer.
ANA does not expect a strong recovery, in spite of a promising outlook for
international passenger travel, which is forecast to rise by nearly 10 per
cent in the full year. The company expects revenues for the year to rise 2.5
per cent to Y794bn and is 'cautiously confident of keeping the airline in
the black'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Shares in Japan Tobacco slump on
first day's trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of finance, which has met strong criticism over the
unpopular partial privatisation of Japan Tobacco, ran into further
embarrassment yesterday as the stock fell sharply on its first day of
trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Shares in Japan Tobacco, the cigarette manufacturing monopoly, closed at
Y1.1m, down 23.5 per cent from its publicly offered price of Y1.438m and
wiping Y133bn (Dollars 1.4bn) off shareholders' investments. After failing
to trade during the first few hours due to the lack of buyers, the stock
finally changed hands at Y1.19m.
Matsushita Electric Works, a subsidiary of the consumer electronics group,
which bought 1,720 shares through the pre-offer auction at about Y1.35m per
share, said it would maintain its holdings for now. Other corporate holders
include Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, which bought 1,120 shares through
the pre-offer auction.
Brokers fear the sharp fall in the stock price will further hit sluggish
retail investor confidence. Over 60 per cent of the small investors who were
allotted the right to buy shares in the public offering forfeited their
allocations due to concerns of the weak Tokyo stock market and the expensive
offering price.
The privatisation flop casts a shadow over future government flotations.
'People will not trust the government in future privatisations,' said one
Japanese broker.
However, amid the criticism the ministry of finance put on a brave face, and
said it intended to go ahead with the sales of the partially privatised
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares during the current year to March,
since it was included in this year's budget.
The transport ministry has taken a more cautious approach, and this week
said it would review plans to list in February West Japan Railway, one of
the six rail companies created by the 1987 break-up of Japanese National
Railways.
Meanwhile, the finance ministry has started to review its pricing method of
shares in companies to be privatised. Rather than choosing a mid-price
achieved in a pre-offer auction, Japanese and foreign brokers are calling
for the adoption of the book-building system used in the US and Europe,
where an offering price is chosen after financial advisers sound out the
leading potential investors.
The Tokyo stock market shrugged off Japan Tobacco's woes, and the Nikkei 225
index closed marginally higher gaining 50.01 to 19,796.36.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher gold prices help lift
Placer Dome 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher gold prices and reduced exploration costs helped boost third-quarter
earnings at Placer Dome, the international mining group, by 38 per cent.
But the Vancouver-based company's share of output from its 13 mines was 4
per cent lower in the first nine months than a year earlier, and it warned
that total 1994 production will be about 100,000oz short of its 1.8m oz
target.
Third-quarter earnings rose to USDollars 18m, or 8 cents a share, from
Dollars 13m, or 6 cents. Sales revenues dipped to Dollars 210m from Dollars
219m, but investment income climbed to Dollars 17m from Dollars 10m.
Cash production costs rose to Dollars 196 per ounce from Dollars 184.
Placer earlier announced a 1 cent increase in its fourth-quarter dividend to
7.5 cents a share.
The slip in production was largely due to lower average grades and to
operating disruptions at the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea and the Golden
Sunlight mine in the US. Ground movement has halted operations at Golden
Sunlight since mid-June, and production is not expected to restart until
early next year.
However, Placer said it still expects to reach its long-term annual
production target of 2.5m oz by the end of the decade. Much of the increase
will probably come from its 70 per cent-owned Las Cristinas property in
Venezuela.
Las Cristinas' annual production is projected at 380,000 oz at an initial
cash cost of Dollars 210 per oz. The mine's capital cost is expected to
reach Dollars 400m.
Placer said it expects to add reserves at five existing mines. In addition,
it plans drilling programmes next year on 20 properties in Argentina,
Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, the US and
Venezuela.
Other exploration opportunities are being sought in India, the Commonwealth
of Independent States and south-east Asia.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Net income climbs 25% to Dollars
185mat Xerox
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net income at Xerox, the US document processing company, climbed 25 per cent
in the third quarter to Dollars 185m, or Dollars 1.60 a share.
If a one-off tax benefit in the same period last year of Dollars 23m is
excluded, earnings from the company's core document processing business
jumped 48 per cent.
With revenues in the latest quarter improving only slightly to Dollars
3.6bn, Xerox said that the strong income growth was driven primarily by
productivity improvements.
During the quarter the company's workforce was reduced by 1,100 as Xerox
continued with its worldwide re-structuring and productivity programme,
which is aimed at reducing payrolls by more than 10,000 by early 1996.
Since the start of the year, 7,700 jobs have been eliminated at Xerox to
take the size of the workforce worldwide to less than 90,000.
The advances in productivity and tight controls on costs boosted the ratio
of selling, administrative and general expenses to revenues by 2.3
percentage points to 29.3 per cent during the quarter.
On the sales front, revenues from the sale of digital products jumped 17 per
cent, while revenues from black and white copiers, which represent almost
two-thirds of total revenues, were flat during the quarter.
Xerox was aided by an improved performance from its Brazilian operation,
where demand for the company's products rose and foreign currency losses
from balance sheet translation fell.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Tractor unit acquisition boosts
Agco to Dollars 31.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Agco, the fast-growing Atlanta-based farm equipment company, yesterday
announced record third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 31.9m, or Dollars
1.72 a share, nearly double the Dollars 16.2m, or Dollars 1.15 a share,
reported a year earlier.
The rise mainly reflects Agco's acquisition of UK-based Massey Ferguson, one
of the world's biggest producers of tractors.
The Dollars 329m deal was completed on June 29.
Sales in the third quarter jumped by 183 per cent to Dollars 481.3m,
reflecting the Massey deal and the takeover last December of White-New Idea,
a US farm equipment business.
Mr Robert Ratliff, Agco's chairman and chief executive, said industry
conditions in North America remained positive.
'Corn production is forecast to be 46 per cent above last year and a bumper
soybean harvest is also expected,' he said.
In western Europe, Massey had benefited from improved market conditions,
especially in the UK, France and Scandinavian countries.
Growth in markets outside North America and western Europe was also
positive.
Pro-forma for the acquisitions, net sales, earnings and earnings per share
for the first nine months would have been Dollars 1.35bn, Dollars 88.6m and
Dollars 4.81, respectively.
This compares with Dollars 1.1bn, Dollars 49.4m and Dollars 2.70,
respectively a year earlier.
The company said it expected to record a Dollars 19.5m charge in the fourth
quarter for non-recurring acquisition-related expenses. This was within the
range previously announced.

<TEXT>
American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has outlined plans to
sell four mines in the US and Canada, and to expand the Latin American
operations which it acquired as part of its recent takeover of Lac Minerals.
Mr Alan Hill, executive vice-president, said yesterday that Barrick plans to
develop four new gold operations over the next four years. First will be a
new mill at the existing Tambo mine in Chile, which is due to be
commissioned early next year.
This will be followed by the Meikle mine, which adjoins Barrick's flagship
Goldstrike property in Nevada; the Cerro Corona mine in Peru; and the Nevada
mine, also in Chile. Tambo is part of the El Indio complex in central Chile,
which was Lac's crown jewel. The Nevada property, also held by Lac, is 50km
north of El Indio. Barrick also recently acquired stakes in two exploration
properties on the Argentine side of the El Indio belt. Drilling will start
later this year on the 60 per cent owned Carmen property.
The properties for sale are the Macassa and Golden Patricia mines in
Ontario, Bullfrog in Nevada and the Red Mountain deposit in British
Columbia. Barrick will retain the Bousquet complex and its 50 per cent stake
in the adjoining Doyon mine in northern Quebec. The two mines have a
combined annual output of 465,000 ounces of gold.
Annual output from existing Barrick mines and the retained Lac assets is
currently about 2.5m ounces, making Barrick the biggest gold producer
outside South Africa.
Mr Hill indicated that the company will outline more detailed plans for the
development of its Latin American assets next February.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Burlington raises Santa Fe bid
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The battle to create the largest railway network in the US intensified
yesterday when Burlington Northern increased its bid for Santa Fe Pacific to
Dollars 3.2bn from Dollars 2.5bn as its rival suitor, Union Pacific, refuted
claims that its own offer for Santa Fe would never receive regulatory
approval.
Santa Fe has rejected Union Pacific's bid - valued at just under Dollars
3.2bn - from the start, advising its shareholders to accept the friendly
offer from Burlington.
Shareholders are due to vote on the proposed merger on November 18, and
yesterday's substantially higher offer from Burlington was clearly intended
to cement approval of the deal at the vote next month.
A spokesman for Burlington said the company was able to increase the value
of its bid by 25 per cent because it had discovered since submitting its
first offer in June that 'the synergies (available from the merger) are
significantly greater than we at first thought they would be'.
He said the two companies now believe that within three years of the merger
being approved they should be able to generate about Dollars 1.5bn in annual
operating income from their combined businesses.
The original estimate put combined yearly income at less than Dollars 1bn.
Union Pacific, however, is determined not to give up without a fight, and
yesterday announced that five railway industry experts the company had hired
to study its offer for Santa Fe concluded that the merger between the two
railways would have good prospects of being approved by the Interstate
Commerce Commission, the government regulatory of railways.
Ever since Union Pacific launched its higher bid for Santa Fe, doubts have
been expressed over whether federal regulators would allow a merger between
two railways whose prime routes are in direct competition with each other.

<TEXT>
Dow Chemical of the US reported a 102 per cent jump in net earnings to
Dollars 288m for the third quarter.
Sales in the quarter rose 15 per cent, made up of 11 per cent extra volume
and a 4 per cent rise in prices.
Dow said it had increased capacity in chemicals and plastics by more than
2bn lbs, at a time of shortage for many of its products.
The group's performance was better than that reported on Wednesday by
DuPont, its larger US rival.
Dow said its plastics division had increased operating profits by 177 per
cent to Dollars 305m on sales up 23 per cent at Dollars 1.9bn.
The strongest volume growth came in the Pacific area, while new capacity had
been added in polyethylene in Canada and polyurethane in China.
The chemicals and performance products division increased profits 139 per
cent to Dollars 182m, on sales up 13 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
The strongest performer was vinyl chloride monomer (used to make PVC),
helped by the opening of a new plant in Texas.
The hydrocarbons and energy division raised profits by 77 per cent to
Dollars 23m on sales up 15 per cent to Dollars 520m.
A new ethylene plant with 1.2bn lbs of capacity was opened in Canada during
the quarter.
Profits at the consumer specialities division fell 12 per cent to Dollars
146m, in spite of an 8 per cent rise in sales to Dollars 1.4bn. Dow said
this was chiefly due to pharmaceuticals and consumer products.
As previously reported, Marion Merrill Dow, its 72 per cent-owned drugs
subsidiary, had a 12 per cent fall in net profits for the quarter.
Dow said in August it was looking at strategic options for the company.

<TEXT>
Allied Signal, the diversified US manufacturer, reported record
third-quarter earnings of Dollars 189m, an increase of 15 per cent.
Sales rose by 11 per cent, the first double-figure increase in six and a
half years.
The company, which has gone through a lengthy period of retrenchment, said
this confirmed its return to growth.
Net earnings in the aerospace division, which makes aircraft engines,
components and flight systems, were up 14 per cent to Dollars 64m on sales
up less than 1 per cent.
The company said this was the first quarterly increase in aerospace sales in
over three years.
Net of acquisitions, sales were slightly down.
Profits in the automotive division, which makes car and truck components,
were up 19 per cent to Dollars 56m on a 13 per cent increase in sales.
This reflected strong sales of cars and trucks in North America and
continued economic recovery in Europe, the company said.
The engineered materials division, which makes a range of products from
carpet fibres to engineering plastics, produced a 25 per cent rise in
earnings to Dollars 84m on sales up 24 per cent.
Operating margins rose from 8.0 per cent to 9.1 per cent. Mr Lawrence
Bossidy, chairman, had set a target of 9 per cent for the year as a whole.
The target for next year was now 10 per cent, he said yesterday.
Productivity for the first nine months rose by 5.9 per cent, just short of
Mr Bossidy's target of 6 per cent annually.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Mobil shapes up for next round: Richard Waters meets Lucio
Noto who says the cuts are not over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucio Noto interrupts impatiently: 'Chop. Chop. Chop.' In his blunt Brooklyn
way, the new chairman of Mobil leaves you in no doubt about how he plans to
raise earnings at the US's second biggest energy group.
It is a message Wall Street likes. On Tuesday, the day after Mobil had
announced it was on track for another round of restructuring, its shares
jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 .
The race to shrink the US's biggest energy groups is on, and Mobil - a late
starter - is trying to claw its way back from behind. Its return on capital,
at around 9 per cent, lags that of its main competitors.
'We have an asset base that we have to work on, we have to get more out of
it,' says Mr Noto. 'We have to get our returns up by a point and a half, or
two. If we don't do this, we aren't going to be here.'
His stark message, in an interview before this week's announcement, makes
clear the cost-cutting at Mobil and other US energy groups is far from over.
Mr Noto, who became Mobil chairman in March, has no comforting messages to
deliver to employees, only the promise of more upheaval.
Mobil has seen its workforce decline by 6,000 people in the past two years,
to 54,000. Since 1991, the company claims to have taken Dollars 675m out of
its controllable costs. Over the next three, says Mr Noto, they should fall
by as much again.
His aim is to lift Mobil's after-tax profits by a half, to an annual Dollars
3bn, over the next five years. Like other energy groups, Mobil is no longer
looking to oil prices to bail it out.
.New projects are now assessed against a range of assumptions for oil
prices. 'We haven't seen any projects that depend on crude at more than
Dollars 15 (a barrel),' says Mr Noto.
The next slice of cost cuts may not be easy. Mobil has been focusing on
shrinking the costs of each of its divisions (the most recent round,
announced in July, will involve the loss of one in five of the jobs in its
chemicals business).
Now, the company is looking for ways of removing overlap across the group.
For example, each part of the group has its own computing operations,
creating duplication both between the divisions and with the group's central
computing functions.
'There is a hell of a lot of duplication,' says Mr Noto. 'Some of it is
natural, but some of it is bullshit, some of it is turf, some of it is
getting one up on the next guy. To take the next step down, you have to look
at these shared cost pots.'
While cost-cutting is likely to remain one of the main factors driving
earnings in the short term, Mobil should also get a lift from the cyclical
rebound in its petrochemicals business. After-tax profits, which slid to
Dollars 44m last year from Dollars 558m in 1989, bounced back to Dollars
148m in the first nine months of this year.
Mr Noto, though, sounds a note of caution. 'I think there's too much
happiness in the chemical business today. It's probably not going to last.'
The rebound in petrochemical profits is threatened by additional production
capacity due to start up in the coming months, he warns. Any long-term
recovery in margins will not come until the end of the decade.
In the longer term, Mobil's spread of big international projects, moderately
successful exploration record (it has replaced 95 per cent of its production
over the past five years) and extensive interests in natural gas are likely
to place it among the more diversified and stable of the US energy groups.
'It has a very well-balanced exploration programme,' says Mr Paul Ting, an
oil industry analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. Ten years ago, 52 per cent
of Mobil's oil and gas production took place in the US. By 1993, that had
fallen to 35 per cent.
This year, Mobil became the first US company to return to drilling in
Vietnam. It has been slower than other Western groups to enter Russia -
though given the delays in getting projects there started, that may not
prove much of a hindrance.
Having a finger in a broad range of overseas ventures is essential if Mobil
is to maintain its reserves. It will only be able to replace about half of
its annual production of 600m barrels of oil from extending existing fields,
says Mr Noto. 'We have to find 300m from new plays.'
In the near term, the biggest addition to Mobil's upstream earnings is
likely to come from two large liquefied natural gas projects in Quatar.
The first, in which the company has a 10 per cent interest, should start
production in early 1987. But the real pay-off will come from the second, in
which it has a far more significant 30 per cent stake.
In its downstream refining and marketing operations, Mobil is more exposed
to Asia Pacific than most, and has suffered from the collapse of refining
margins in the area this year.
Though a depressant on short-term profits, Mr Noto claims the collapse will
help Mobil by discouraging rivals from building new refineries in the
region. 'The US is still our biggest market, it is still important to us: we
are loyal Americans, we like to see America prosper,' he says. But adds:
'The opportunities here are closing off and the opportunities abroad are
opening up.'

Banesto, which will earn Pta28bn from the disposal, has undertaken to sell

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Newcrest Mining, the mining group which was formed when Broken Hill
Proprietary and Newmont Mining merged their Australian goldmining
subsidiaries, yesterday announced profits after tax of ADollars 35.5m
(USDollars 26.4m) for the first nine months of 1994. This represents a 22.3
per cent increase on the same period in 1993. Profit after tax for the third
quarter alone, to end-September, was ADollars 11.7m, up 16.4 per cent on the
previous year, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The group's equity gold production in the three months was 166,641oz, some
7,000oz less than in the second quarter. This reduction was due to lower
grade production at its Telfer mine in Western Australia.
The cost of production was Dollars 393 per oz, up from Dollars 374 - an
increase also blamed on the temporary shortfall in the oxide grade.
The company said it planned to spend ADollars 17.6m to develop the first
stage of the Mariner project at Telfer, and that it had upgraded the
resource at its Cadia Hill gold/copper project in New South Wales, to 4.6m
oz of gold. Shares in Newcrest closed 20 cents higher at ADollars 7.20.

Vital, the Norwegian life insurance and pension group, plunged to a pre-tax
loss of NKr97m in the nine months to September from a profit of NKr2.31bn
last time, writes Karen Fossli.
The reversal was caused by a sharp reduction in gross financial income which
sunk to NKr1.17bn from NKr3.61bn.
'The weak results were due to the increase in interest rates which caused a
sharp reduction in the value of the company's bonds,' Vital explained.
Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, said yesterday
that it would to seek a listing on the New York stock exchange in spring of

Dyno Industrier, the Norwegian chemicals, plastics and explosives group,
more than doubled nine-month pre-tax profits to NKr476m (Dollars 73.2m) from
NKr234m, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The advance was attributed to improved profitability of methanol operations
in the Netherlands, increased supplies to the automotive industry and
expanded deliveries of explosives and resins.
Group revenue rose by 20 per cent to NKr7.3bn while operating profit doubled
to NKr597m.
Mr Arild Ingjerd, Dyno's president, warned, however, that margins were
coming under heavy pressure from higher prices for raw materials, such as
methanol and ammonia.
Apart from producing methanol outside Norway, Dyno consumes 300,000 tonnes
of the chemical a year. It also expressed concern over rising prices for
plastics raw materials. This effects its plastics division which, among
other things, supplies fuel tank systems to the automotive industry.

Scotgen Pharmaceuticals, the Anglo-US drug company, yesterday emerged as a
rival bidder for Porton International, the UK biotechnology group which
earlier this week announced a Pounds 65.5m (Dollars 103.5m) agreed takeover.
The California-based company said it would trump the recommended offer from
Beaufour Ipsen, a French pharmaceutical business, by almost 50 per cent with
a bid valuing the UK group at Pounds 96.3m.
Scotgen claimed its overtures had been ignored by Kleinwort Benson, Porton's
financial advisers.
It has offered Pounds 42m in cash and Pounds 54.3m in shares.
On advice from the merchant bank, shareholders with 66.2 per cent of Porton
have given irrevocable undertakings to accept the French bid, worth Pounds
13.40 in cash or notes. Of those investors, the largest stake is held by Mr
Wensley Haydon-Baillie, Porton's founder and ex-chairman, who stands to
receive more than Pounds 20m for his 33 per cent stake.
Kleinwort Benson was unavailable for comment. Mr Tony Gover, Porton
vice-chairman, said he was 'unaware of a counter bid'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Usinor forges stronger case for
sell-off - State-owned French steel group is showing benefit of
restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, has twice wrested Europe's
biggest steel maker back from daunting losses - after 1986, when he took the
helm of France's sprawling steel concern, and over the past six months. This
time he is determined that recovery will be permanent.
Yesterday's first-half results showed a remarkable rebound to a net profit
of FFr471m (USDollars 92m) after losses of a staggering FFr5.7bn for all of
1993.
The state-owned group's chairman is optimistic, if not yet satisfied. 'We
must be in a position to stay in the black through the next downturn in the
industry cycle.'
There is much at stake. Evidence of a sustainable recovery will prepare the
way for privatisation of the steel concern, which is one of 21 public sector
companies already sold or scheduled for sale by the centre-right government
of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur.
Privatisation would give the company access to the financial resources
needed for expansion. 'The state can no more be a good shareholder,' says Mr
Mer. 'It does not have the money for industry.'
The first-half transformation is an important step towards Mr Mer's
objective. It partly reflects the impact of exceptional gains, in particular
the FFr900m received as a result of the flotation of a 40 per cent stake in
Ugine, the stainless steel division.
However, the recovery is also the result of the revival in the international
steel industry following two years of deep recession, and of the benefits of
the company's restructuring and cost-cutting measures.
Since 1986, when Mr Mer faced the task of merging the loss-making Usinor and
Sacilor steel makers, the headcount has fallen steadily. The workforce has
dropped from 95,750 in 1989 to about 68,000 at the end of last year.
Productivity has risen from 5.1 man hours a ton in 1986 to less than three
hours a ton today.
For Mr Mer, the productivity and cost-cutting measures are set to continue.
So is the recovery in profits. 'We have experienced further progress in the
second half, and I think that 1995 will be a good year.'
Sustained recovery beyond the current upswing in the steel market, however,
requires further reshaping. 'Some parts of the business are really
problematic,' says Mr Martin Doble, director of Beddows &amp; Co, a consultancy
for the steel industry. He, and many others, believe the problems centre on
Usinor's long products business, comprising wires and steel for engineered
products. It is a fiercely competitive activity.
A bigger burden lies in the group's indebtedness. A series of acquisitions
in the late 1980s, including that of Jones &amp; Laughlin, the second-biggest
stainless steel maker in the US, saddled Usinor Sacilor with debts of
FFr24bn at the end of 1993. The threat is compounded by the recent rise in
interest rates.
These weak points are not lost on Mr Mer. While he defends his acquisition
spree in the 1980s, which he says gave the group the necessary presence in
production and marketing, he has been curbing debt.
The flotation of Ugine, and asset sales, have reduced debts to about
FFr20bn.
For the first time in four years, debt stands below the value of the
company's equity.
The Usinor chairman is also making progress at the company's problem
businesses. The long products division has undergone a substantial
restructuring and is now entering the final phase. A more efficient plant
has been constructed, including a mini mill at Gandrange in eastern France
which started production in July. Last week, Usinor Sacilor announced it was
negotiating the sale of SAM, its steel reinforcements business, to ASW of
the UK.
The sale of SAM would mark an important step in reorganising the group's
activities, a process Mr Mer believes is nearing completion. 'By mid-1995 we
should be in the shape that we are seeking,' he says.
The shape of the international steel industry as a whole, however, is less
certain. Just as Usinor was blighted by overcapacity and recession in 1992
and 1993, so are its fortunes still hostage to the broader environment.
Mr Mer believes progress has been achieved in the European Commission's
restructuring plan, even though he has been a fierce critic of subsidies to
Spanish, German and Italian producers. 'To a non-European it must seem like
a crazy way of managing an industry, allowing subsidies to obstruct
necessary capacity reduction.'
He is irked by subsidies because his company has reduced its own net
capacity of laminates by 1.2m tons since 1987 without the help of state
subsidies. 'I could have asked for subsidies of FFr8bn last year,' he says.
But, he argues, that would have undermined his philosophy at Usinor and sent
the wrong signal to managers and workers. 'Besides,' he says with a grin,
'the French government would have said 'no'.'
In spite of his chagrin at state aid to rivals, Mr Mer believes Europe's
restructuring efforts have yielded results. 'We will probably see a
reduction of about 15m tons of capacity, rather than the 19m targeted. But
that is still significant.'
It is also, he believes, enough for now. 'Capacity utilisation is very high.
All of Europe's big steel producers will report profits next year. So I
don't think it necessary to have further capacity cuts at the moment.'
Whether more restructuring will be needed, he argues, will depend partly on
the policy of the European Union towards imports from eastern Europe, Russia
and Ukraine. 'At the moment, western Europe has net steel exports of more
than 10m tons a year. If this were to change, because of increased imports
or reduced shipments, then capacity would be too high.'
It is Ukraine and Russia which are of particular concern. The scale of their
capacity dwarfs the potential threat from eastern European countries. In the
latter case, he believes western Europe can cope with a gradual opening of
the market, presently restricted by quotas, over the next few years.
By then, Usinor Sacilor may be on the way to the private sector. Mr Mer is
reluctant to suggest the timing for such an operation. But once the
redressment is established he does not see obstacles to a sale.
For the Usinor chairman, such a move would have little impact on the
management of the group. 'We are run like a private sector company. There is
no interference from the state,' he says.
Nor should the trade unions, which have sought to block other
privatisations, pose a threat. 'I think it would not be too hard to convince
them, despite their basic instinct that they would like to remain under the
umbrella of the state.'
The complexities and size of such an operation suggest that privatisation
remains some way down the road. Of the routes already being mooted one
involves selling stakes in various parts of the company, as was done with
Ugine, or the possible flotation of separate activities.
It is not an option which finds favour with Mr Mer. The flotation of Ugine,
he says, was a one-off. Privatisation, when it comes, should be for the
whole group. Having spent the past eight years forging a coherent whole from
the rag-bag of assets he inherited, such a reaction is understandable.

Dofasco, one of Canada's two biggest steel makers, nearly doubled pre-tax
profits in the third quarter with higher prices and surging demand for flat
rolled products for the car, appliance and pipeline industries, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Sales rose 12 per cent to CDollars 565m and pre-tax profit was CDollars
57.2m (USDollars 42.5m), against CDollars 29.5m. But after special tax
factors, final net profit was CDollars 53.8m or 56 cents against Dollars 62m
or 70 cents a share a year earlier.
At the nine-month stage, net profits rose to CDollars 157.5m or CDollars
1.66, up from 56 per cent or 46 cents a share on sales of CDollars 1.65bn,
against CDollars 1.57bn.

Tokyo Electric Power, Japan's leading electric utility company, will issue
Y100bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in 20-year straight bonds for public subscription
next month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Japanese government bond market has been affected by expectations of
higher short-term interest rates and the issue could have a further negative
impact on the market.
Tepco, which has been forced to scale down the amount of the issue from
Y150bn after surveys of prospective investor demand, will launch the issue
with a coupon of 5.05 per cent on November 28. Nikko Securities will serve
as lead manager. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, assigned
the bond a double-A plus rating, while Moody's Investors Service rated it
Aaa.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Canadian Airlines posts record
earnings for term
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian Airlines Inter-national, which was on the brink of collapse before
the conclusion of a financial restructuring earlier this year, has bounced
back with record quarterly earnings.
The Calgary-based airline will take another important step forward next week
when it implements a wide-ranging services contract with AMR Corp, the
holding company of American Airlines. AMR paid CDollars 246m (USDollars
182m) for a 25 per cent voting interest in the Canadian carrier as part of
the restructuring.
The contract, which is valued at about USDollars 110m a year, includes a
switch to AMR's data-processing and yield-management facilities and to its
Sabre computer-reservation system.
PWA Corp, Canadian's holding company, reported third-quarter earnings of
CDollars 85.4m, or 11 cents a share, up from CDollars 38.5m, or 78 cents.
The latest per-share figure reflects a significant dilution as a result of a
big debt-to-equity conversion which formed part of the restructuring, and
which cut interest expense.
Nine-month net profit was CDollars 19.5m, against a loss of CDollars 199m a
year earlier, including special charges. Operating income climbed by 8.3 per
cent to CDollars 110.6m, due to increased traffic and an improved yield per
mile. The load factor was unchanged at 76.8 per cent.
Mr Drew Fitch, senior vice-president for finance, said the airline aims to
achieve earnings of CDollars 75m next year, and cash flow from operations of
CDollars 500m by 1997.
AMR's 20-year contract with Canadian reflects the US carrier's efforts to
expand the services which it provides to other airlines. The two airlines
are also co-operating in marketing, including reciprocity for their
frequent-flier programmes.

<TEXT>
International Business Machines has been forced to temporarily halt
shipments of its new personal computer operating system, OS/2 Warp, because
of a software bug that interferes with loading the software on to some PCs.
IBM said the problem is minor and that retailers will receive shipments of
OS/2 Warp on schedule. People who have already purchased the program will be
sent a new version.
The incident is an embarrassment for IBM, which is mounting a Dollars 50m
advertising campaign for Warp in an attempt to win ground in the PC
operating system software market which is dominated by Microsoft's Windows.
Microsoft has shipped more than 50m copies of Windows, compared with the
almost 6m copies of OS/2 that IBM has shipped.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Delta and UAL post solid gains
in third-quarter operating income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Delta Air Lines and UAL, parent of United Airlines, yesterday offered more
evidence of a gradual return to financial stability for the US airline
industry, as both posted solid operational gains in the third quarter.
The encouraging results were released a week after AMR, parent of American
Airlines, the largest US carrier, announced details of its best three-month
operating period in the past five years.
Wall Street responded warmly to yesterday's news from UAL and Delta, the
second and third biggest groups in the industry, respectively.
In early trading on the NYSE, UAL's share price added Dollars 3/4 to Dollars
86 and Delta's stock jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 48 3/8.
Delta's performance was particularly impressive. Operating income for the
quarter climbed 27 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 154m, on revenues
of Dollars 3.2bn, up slightly from Dollars 3.1bn in the 1993 period.
The gain was held to a modest level as a result of a 3.6 per cent reduction
in capacity and lower fares, as reflected in a 4.4 per cent downturn in
revenue per passenger mile.
Nevertheless, underlying net income was up a robust 19 per cent at Dollars
72m. Including a one-time after-tax gain of Dollars 114m, net income was
Dollars 186m, against Dollars 61m a year ago.
UAL's results were more complicated. The third quarter was the first to
reflect an agreement under which employees would acquire an initial
ownership stake of 55 per cent in return for wage and other concessions.
As a result of the transaction, outstanding shares decreased to 14.6m, from
28.7m a year ago on a fully diluted basis.
The company took a Dollars 96m one-time charge to pay costs associated with
the buy-out. Excluding the provision, profits were nearly 20 per cent better
at Dollars 178m, or Dollars 10.05 a share, compared with Dollars 149m in the
1993 period.
The improved profitability was struck on a 3.3 per cent gain in revenues to
Dollars 3.4bn.
A 7.2 per cent increase in traffic was partially offset by a 2.4 per cent
decline in revenue per passenger mile.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil to pay Dollars 454m
extra tax on settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pennzoil said it had reached agreement with the US authorities to pay
Dollars 454m in additional taxes on a Dollars 3bn settlement it received
from rival US energy group Texaco six years ago.
The amount is less than half the Dollars 957m tax assessment by the Internal
Revenue Service earlier this year.
The taxes stem from the settlement of a dispute between Pennzoil and Texaco
over the latter's takeover of Getty Oil in 1986.
The acquisition thwarted a deal that had already been agreed between
Pennzoil and Getty.
A Texas jury initially awarded Pennzoil Dollars 10.3bn in damages, forcing
Texaco to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.
The back taxes relate to Dollars 2.2bn of the settlement, which was used by
Pennzoil to buy shares in another US energy group, Chevron.

Earnings at American International Group, the US insurer, advanced by more
than a fifth in the third quarter, reflecting its international expansion in
both the life and general insurance areas.
Excluding accounting adjustments and capital gains, group net income jumped
22 per cent to Dollars 532.3m from a year ago, on revenues up 11 per cent to
Dollars 5.7bn.
Mr Maurice Greenberg, the chairman, pointed to strong growth in both life
and property/casualty insurance during the period.
In general insurance, operating income (before capital gains) was up 34 per
cent, to Dollars 416m, in part reflecting Dollars 47m of catastrophe losses
last year.
Life insurance operating earnings rose 19 per cent, to Dollars 180m before
capital gains, with Asia performing particularly strongly.
In the US, AIG saw 'double-digit' premium growth in some specialty insurance
areas, while rates on property insurance remained firm.
Overall, reported net income for the period was Dollars 542.5m, or Dollars
1.71 a share, up from Dollars 451.1m, or Dollars 1.42 a share, the year
before.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: French market watchdog in
Eurotunnel inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French market watchdog,
yesterday launched an official inquiry into whether Eurotunnel, the Channel
tunnel operator, fairly presented its financial position in its rights issue
prospectus published in May this year.
In a letter sent to Mr Patrick Ponsolle, a Eurotunnel director, and released
late last night, the COB said it was particularly concerned about the
validity of the projections given in the document and the reasons why the
company did not report sooner on the financial impact of its delays.
The inquiry was triggered by remarks earlier this month by Mr Graham
Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, who was reported as saying
the group had 'no hope' of meeting its profit forecasts made in May.
The release of the letter looked set to trigger a row between the COB and
Eurotunnel, which last night said it was 'surprised' by the inquiry and
'shocked' that the watchdog had made its contents public.
It may also cause a further fall today in the price of Eurotunnel's shares,
which dropped sharply after reports of Mr Corbett's comment and have been
trading at historic lows in the past few weeks with the release of
successive pieces of bad news.
The COB also raised concerns about the way in which Mr Corbett communicated
his doubts through the press rather than by an official statement, which it
said was more serious given that Eurotunnel is quoted in both London and
Paris.
Eurotunnel said it would co-operate fully with the COB, but stressed that
the projections given in the prospectus were always illustrative and subject
to change.
'We don't believe we have improperly provided any information,' it said. 'If
the assumptions have changed, it's not unreasonable that the projections
have changed.'

stake

<TEXT>
Alcatel Alsthom, the French engineering and telecommunications group, said
yesterday it planned to take a stake of about 20 per cent in the mobile
telephones operations of Generale des Eaux, the utilities and communications
group.
Alcatel said its decision to seek a stake in Cofira, the mobile telecoms arm
of Generale des Eaux, follows the failure of its bid to win the licence for
France's third mobile telecoms telephone network.
Earlier this month, the French government awarded the licence to Bouygues,
the construction and communications company.
The government claimed Alcatel's position as a leading supplier of telecoms
equipment had prejudiced its bid to become an operator. But the company
rejected the argument and said it still intended to expand in
telecommunications services.
The investment in Cofira could involve the purchase by Alcatel of the 19.9
per cent stake currently held by Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making
state-owned bank. Alcatel said it was in discussions with Credit Lyonnais,
but that it was also holding talks with other minority shareholders in
Cofira.
The proposed alliance is the latest step in the reinforcement of the mobile
telecoms activities of Generale des Eaux. Two weeks ago, it said it had
extended an alliance with Vodafone of the UK and it was forming a
partnership with Southwestern Bell of the US.

Axa, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday bucked the trend in
the sector by reporting group net profits up 26 per cent to FFr1.5bn
(Dollars 293m) in the first six months of the year.
Mr Claude Bebear, chairman, forecast that, in the absence of 'major
catastrophes' in its insurance and reinsurance markets, full-year profits
would be up on last year's FFr2.04bn.
Axa's total consolidated revenues rose 10 per cent to FFr65.9bn during the
first half of the year, while revenues, including unconsolidated mutual
companies, stood at FFr71.2bn compared with FFr64.8bn in the same period
last year.
Consolidated premium income from the group's life businesses rose by a third
to FFr7.2bn, while non-life premiums rose by just 8 per cent to FFr8.2bn
during the first half.
Axa's worldwide net group income from reinsurance increased nearly
three-fold to FFr143m from FFr49m, with a 13 per cent increase in financial
services and property to FFr304m.
Losses from holding company activities dropped to FFr10m from FFr31m, while
those from intra-group transfers from subsidiaries and equity holdings rose
to FFr296m from FFr187m.
Geographically, group consolidated net income from France rose 7 per cent to
FFr393m, while that from the US rose to FFr224m from FFr4m as a result of
the recovery in the Equitable, the insurer controlled by Axa.
However, net income from the UK dropped 22 per cent to FFr200m, while
falling 15 per cent to FFr88m for the group's activities in the rest of the
world.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz maintains growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Annual turnover at Daimler-Benz is expected to exceed DM100bn (Dollars
66.87bn) for the first time this year, following a 9 per cent sales rise to
DM73.2bn in the nine months to the end of September.
The factors which generated a 13.4 per cent surge in turnover and a sharp
profits turnround in the first half had continued in the third quarter, the
group said in an interim report yesterday.
These included international economic recovery, further cost cuts and
productivity increases - the group workforce was cut by 7 per cent in the
year to the end of September - and new car models from the Mercedes-Benz
subsidiary, which traditionally generates the largest share of sales and
profits.
The report, which contained no earnings data, said Mercedes sales rose 13
per cent to DM51bn in the period. Car factories were working at full
capacity, and deliveries of cars had increased 29 per cent to 436,000 units.
However, sales revenue from this division rose only 13 per cent to DM31bn,
reflecting both the fierce price competition in the car market and the high
proportion of sales attributable to the new C-class car, introduced last
year at prices virtually unchanged from those of its predecessor.
Mercedes reported particularly brisk demand for cars and Freightliner trucks
in the US, where turnover rose 22 per cent and helped increase group
revenues there by 13 per cent to DM13bn.
Mercedes' sales in Germany rose 31 per cent, while in the rest of western
Europe turnover increased 37 per cent.
Meanwhile, the negative factors which have long dogged Deutsche Aerospace
(Dasa) - defence budget cuts and low demand from airlines - continued to
depress the subsidiary's performance. Sales, which were down 5.6 per cent at
halfway, were 9 per cent lower at DM10.5bn at the end of the third quarter.
While the introduction of the Dornier 328 regional aircraft helped boost
turnover in the aircraft division, it was not enough to offset the effects
of a fall in sales at Fokker of the Netherlands.
Dasa, which will in future be known as Daimler-Benz Aerospace, also recorded
a 4 per cent increase in incoming orders during the review period.
The electronics and electrical engineering subsidiary, AEG (recently renamed
AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie) raised sales 6 per cent to DM7.4bn, due mainly
to improved foreign operations which increased turnover 12 per cent.
At home, where sales rose only 2 per cent, the strongest push came from the
railways and microelectronics divisions.
The group's services division, Debis, which includes financial, mobile
communications and software services, reported a 17 per cent increase in
sales to DM7.9bn.

SKF, the world's leading maker of roller bearings, yesterday announced a
SKr1.8bn (Dollars 297m) swing into the black at nine months, helped by
strong demand from car and truck manufacturers in Europe and the US.
The Swedish group also benefited from cost-cutting, lower financial costs
and a return to profit at Ovako Steel.
Profit after financial items amounted to SKr1.14bn, compared with a SKr709m
loss last time. The result keeps the company on course for full-year profits
of SKr1.5bn as the fourth quarter is traditionally the company's strongest
period.
Sales climbed 14 per cent to SKr24.6bn from SKr21.5bn, driven mainly by a 12
per cent rise in volumes. However the company said it also benefited from
price rises, particularly in the after-markets segment, as well as from the
weaker krona.
Operating profits amounted to SKr1.43bn, after a SKr99m loss, while
financial costs fell to SKr291m from SKr610m.
The group's main unit, bearings and seals, achieved a SKr1.05bn profit,
compared with a SKr422m loss, after sales climbed to SKr22.9bn from
SKr20.03bn.
Sales to the automotive sector, the company's biggest customer, were nearly
20 per cent higher as it benefited from rising demand and increased market
share.
Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said the North American trucks market
had continued to develop strongly with no signs of weaker demand.
The group's two other segments, machinery and after-markets, also showed
positive sales growth.
Ovako Steel reported a SKr102m profit on sales of SKr2.73bn. In the same
1993 period, it made a SKr301m loss on sales of SKr2.12bn.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Trelleborg posts sharp turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rising metal prices and reduced financial costs enabled Trelleborg, the
Swedish mining and metals group, to report a SKr534m (Dollars 75.54m) profit
for the first nine months. The result compares with a SKr884m loss in the
same 1993 period.
The turnround came in spite of a fall in sales to SKr14.05bn from SKr15.72bn
caused by restructuring.
A better performance from the group's four main divisions - mines and
smelters, rubber products, metal processing and distribution - enabled
operating profits to rise to SKr615m from SKr64m.
There was also a SKr296m contribution from associated companies, after last
year's SKr173m loss, due mainly to higher earnings from Falconbridge, the
nickel producer.
The third element in the turnround was the fall in net financial costs to
SKr377m from SKr775m, reflecting lower debt levels and interest rates.
The best performance came from the mines and smelters division which swung
to a SKr137m operating profit from a SKr191m deficit. The unit has benefited
from higher prices for copper, lead, nickel, gold and silver.
Mr Kjell Nilsson, group president, said the positive trend continued for all
business areas.

<TEXT>
Munich Reinsurance, the world's largest reinsurance company, is increasing
its dividend and strengthening reserves after a rise in profits which
benefited from a sharp cut in underwriting losses.
The payment to shareholders for the year to June 30 1994 will rise DM1 to
DM12 a share, with the parent company's net profit up by 23 per cent to
DM91m (Dollars 61m). Full group figures will be given early next month. In
1992-93, group net profits rose 3 per cent to DM287m, with group premium
income 11 per cent higher at DM26bn.
Last year's underwriting loss was DM315m, about a third of the previous
year's figure.
Munich Re, which owns 25 per cent of Allianz, Germany's and Europe's largest
insurance concern - which in turn owns 25 per cent of Munich Re - also said
it had added a further DM523m to its provisions for claims equalisation and
for big risks, after DM33m in 1992-93. In spite of lower profits on its
investments, it has also put another DM350m into its reserves for claims
still outstanding, compared with DM450m last year. A further DM50 will go
into its revenue reserves.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gildemeister in talks with
Milacron on sales deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gildemeister and Cincinnati Milacron, two of the world's largest machine
tool companies, are discussing a sales agreement which would strengthen
Gildemeister's presence in the US and Milacron's in Europe.
Mr Axel Kemna, chairman of Gildemeister, which is based in Bielefeld,
Germany, said a deal would enable the company to lift sales in the US, where
its market position is weak. In turn, Milacron could use the recently-formed
Deckel Maho Gildemeister sales network in Europe.
If the two companies reach a deal, it would be one of the most important
co-operations between US and European machine tool companies, and strengthen
the sales base of both companies as the fiercely-competitive machine tool
market emerges from recession.
The discussions between the two companies come amid continuing speculation
that Milacron might buy a 25 per cent stake in Gildemeister. Mr Kemna,
speaking in London, said the rumours were untrue.
Gildemeister derives only 5 per cent of its sales from the US market, and is
keen to expand its sales outside Europe.
A deal would cap an extraordinary period of corporate activity for
Gildemeister.
In July, it paid DM90m (Dollars 60.18m) for the main assets of Deckel-Maho,
the ill-fated merger of two big German milling machine companies completed
only in December last year, and called in an administrator five months
later.
The purchase gave Gildemeister a strong position in milling machines to
complement its own range of turning machines. Gildemeister is raising DM70m
through a capital increase, of which DM40m will go as share capital for
Deckel-Maho.
Following the takeover, Gildemeister would make a loss this year, may break
even next year, and should make a profit in 1996, said Mr Kemna.

<TEXT>
L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, yesterday posted sales up 14.4
per cent to FFr34.5bn (Dollars 6.74bn) at the nine months stage, based on
average exchange rates. This would be equivalent to FFr47bn based on
exchange rates at the end of last month, the company said.
The group said full-year profit would be up 20 per cent on ordinary
activities before tax - excluding any significant changes in exchange rates.
The third-quarter results were re-stated following consolidation from July 1
this year of four new subsidiaries. The group announced a transfer and share
purchase arrangement in September with Cosmair USA, Cosmair Canada,
Lorsa/Fagel of Switzerland and Procasa of Spain.
L'Oreal said the sales under the old basis of consolidation would have been
up 7.6 per cent at nine months. Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, chairman and chief
executive, called the results 'very encouraging'.

Net asset value per share at Scottish Mortgage &amp; Trust, managed by Baillie
Gifford, fell by 3.8 per cent to 245.6p during the six months to September
30.
Over the same period, the FT-SE-A All-Share Index fell 3.3 per cent and the
World Index fell 1.6 per cent. The March 31 net asset value was restated at
255.3p - 2.2p lower - in line with FRS 4.
Total assets grew from Pounds 1.04bn to Pounds 1.08bn, but borrowings also
increased.
Earnings rose 13 per cent from 2.66p to 3p per share; the interim dividend
is 1.4p, up 3.7 per cent from the previous year. The board said the
full-year dividend was likely to be 'modestly up in real terms'.
The trust invests internationally, with a UK bias, and remains overweight in
continental Europe and the smaller Pacific markets compared with the US and
Japan. Its gilt portfolio has been increased from Pounds 57m to Pounds 126m.

yesterday.
Domino is also paying an initial Dollars 2.84m cash for certain assets of
Control Print, a trading division of Avery Dennison, which makes ink-jet
coding and marking systems. Book value amounts to Dollars 1m; it made an

Shiloh, the textile spining, healthcare, protective clothing and packaging
group, lifted pre-tax profits by 27 per cent in the half year to October 1.
The advance, from Pounds 490,081 to Pounds 622,355, was despite a Pounds
205,000 loss on the packaging side.
Mr Edmund Gartside, chairman, said the group was urgently addressing the
loss on packaging and was planning to withdraw from the least profitable
markets, for which some provision might have to be made at the year-end.
In addition, an exceptional provision of up to Pounds 392,000 might have to
be made in regarding the deferred consideration on the land sale made in
October 1990.
Turnover improved by 9 per cent to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 13.4m).
Earnings per share emerged at 7.14p (5.75p) and the interim dividend is held
at 1p.

Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.14m against Pounds 3.45m were announced

The outcome was helped by a fall in interests costs from Pounds 3m to Pounds

but progress had been hindered by the net running costs of the Pont Royal

Archer said in July that it would finance the deal, which it expected
conclude this month, by issuing approximately 1.8m new shares to Cox
shareholders. But yesterday it said the process of due diligence had taken
longer than expected and that changes in Lloyd's rules on corporate capital
had proved an added distraction.
Mr Bryan Kellett, chairman, said: 'We are still hopeful that the various
matters which have caused the delay can be resolved and an agreement
concluded over the coming months.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadcastle, the USM-quoted financial services group, reported a fall in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 224,000 to Pounds 121,000 for the six months to
end-June.
The decline, the company said, was the result of reduced interest receivable
and an exceptional charge of Pounds 152,000 related to its discontinued
recruitment business. At the operating level profits were up 22 per cent
from Pounds 224,000 to Pounds 273,000.
Earnings came out at 0.29p (1.22p) per share; the interim dividend is
doubled to 0.5p.
The company also announced proposals to raise some Pounds 1.9m before
expenses via a placing and open offer of 7.97m new shares at 24p on a
1-for-4 basis, and a further Pounds 2m by way of a preference issue of 2m
shares at Pounds 1 apiece.
Broadcastle intends to apply to move to a full listing.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Medeva wins patent case against Biogen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medeva, the pharmaceutical company, yesterday scored an important legal
victory against Biogen, its US rival, over the right to develop a hepatitis
B vaccine in Britain.
Its shares climbed 9p to 174p after the Court of Appeal in London overturned
an earlier High Court ruling that Medeva had infringed Biogen's patents.
The move, enabling the company to develop and manufacture the treatment in
the UK - a market worth an estimated Pounds 12m a year - could prompt
challenges against Biogen in other in European countries.
Welcoming the court decision, Mr Bill Bogie, Medeva chief executive, said:
'They not only threw out the previous ruling but decided the Biogen patent
was invalid. That opens a number of commercial and legal opportunities for
us.'
A bid by Medeva to develop and sell its vaccine in markets such as Germany
and France, however, could prove difficult following a European Patent
Office's decision in July to uphold Biogen's hepatitis B patent.
That meant Medeva had to persuade the courts to revoke the patent in each
market where it wanted a presence.
Yesterday's court ruling signalled Medeva's first successful challenge
against Biogen.
'It's very exciting,' said Mr Bogie. 'It allows us to develop the vaccine
here in the UK and export it to markets where Biogen's patent does not
apply, such as the Far East.'
Such opportunities could give Medeva a sizeable share of a market with an
estimated global value of Pounds 500m a year.
Biogen, meanwhile, said it was considering its options and did not rule out
taking the legal action further.
'This is of no material financial impact,' said Ms Amy Hedison, head of
investor relations at Biogen. 'But we will vigorously defend our patent in
any country where Medeva challenges it.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: European Court rules against Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court in Luxembourg yesterday threw out an attempt by Ladbroke
to break the French state-owned betting monopoly, the Pari Mutuel Urbain.
In the first of several cases it has brought to the European Court, Ladbroke
argued that the PMU's monopoly restricted competition and was contrary to
the Treaty of Rome.
The hotels, betting and retail group argued that the European Commission had
a duty to take up its complaint. The European Court of First Instance
decided the Commission was under no duty to act because the treaty's
competition provisions did not apply to betting and gaming.
Ladbroke said yesterday that the PMU's monopoly over French racing made the
UK group's betting operations in other European countries less competitive.
Ladbroke has 600 betting shops in Belgium, where it claims to be the biggest
operator. While Ladbroke shows Belgian and UK racing in the shops, the PMU
prevents it from showing French races, which would be a popular attraction.
Ladbroke's competitor, the Belgian PMU, is allowed to show French racing,
Ladbroke said.
The French monopoly also forced Ladbroke to close its only German betting
shop last year. The shop was in the eastern sector of Berlin. Although it
showed German and UK racing, Ladbroke said it needed to show French racing
to survive.
Had the shop been in the western sector of Berlin it would have been able to
show French races. This was because the PMU had concluded an agreement with
a West German agent in the days when the city was still divided.
Ladbroke said it would have been able to negotiate an agreement with the
agent, but the agency agreement did not extend to the eastern sector of
Berlin.
Ladbroke said it had approached the PMU to grant it rights to French racing
in east Berlin, but this had been refused.
The group said it could appeal against the decision, but had not yet decided
whether it would do so. It said its other European Court cases were still
awaiting a decision. These include a bid to increase competition in the
Belgian market.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: TLG valued at Pounds 205m by float price of
115p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting Group, is valued at Pounds
204.8m at the flotation price of 115p, announced yesterday. About Pounds 77m
will be raised for the company.
As with several recent issues, TLG's value is at the lower end of the
company's expectations at the time of its pathfinder prospectus two weeks
ago.
Institutional investors who had been approached about investing in the
company suggested that the shares had originally been offered at nearer
125p.
Mr Hamish Bryce, executive chairman, said yesterday: 'The pricing is
realistic given institutional sentiment and the market conditions.'
He added that the target for the amount of new money raised had been
reached, the bulk of which would be used to repair the group's balance
sheet.
Gearing of 93 per cent will drop to 23.6 per cent following the float.
The flotation involves the placing and public offer of 78.3m shares, raising
a total of Pounds 90m. Of this, Pounds 10m goes to Investcorp, the
Bahrain-based investment group, and Thorn EMI, which sold TLG to the
management three years ago. Investcorp will still have a 44.8 per cent
stake, and Thorn 6.5 per cent.
None of the management is selling shares, leaving its interest at 7.3 per
cent.
Mr Bryce said the company would be pursuing growth through both organic and
acquisitive means.
'There are plenty of opportunities in both areas and our cash position means
we are well placed,' he said. In particular, east Asia and Germany were two
of the areas which were attracting the group's attention.
For the five months to the end of August, TLG achieved operating profits of
Pounds 6.1m compared with Pounds 2.6m. Sales in the period were Pounds
136.5m against Pounds 131.3m.
Although the directors are forsaking any share sales, the senior management
team, numbering 16, are to receive a one-off bonus payment of Pounds
750,000. This will be taken as an exceptional charge for the year to next
March.
Trading in the shares is due to start on November 10.
COMMENT
Although institutional frostiness to new issues may have led TLG to lower
its sights, this may not be a bad thing. With the group likely to turn in
full-year pre-tax profits in excess of Pounds 20m, the prospective p/e comes
in at 12.5 times. This is well below the likes of Menvier-Swain, which has a
decent track record, on a prospective 17.5 times and the electrical and
electronic sector's 16.2. TLG must now earn a better rating. A fragmented
European lighting market gives plenty of potential for expansion, while the
group has an established product range, a committed management and a solid
balance sheet, giving it longer-term potential.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: APV issues statement to stabilise shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, the producer of food manufacturing equipment, responded yesterday to
the recent volatility in its share price by reiterating that a restructuring
of the group was being planned.
In an unusual move, APV issued a short statement that gave no new
information about the company or its financial position. 'It is just
intended to pacify the market and calm things down,' APV said.
The company had said last month, when it announced interim results, that an
unspecified charge would be taken in the second half to cover further
restructuring in its liquid foods division.
The planned restructuring - for which analysts' estimates range from Pounds
10m to Pounds 40m - has heightened City nervousness about APV and turnover
in its shares has been heavy.
The shares closed 2p lower yesterday at 61 1/2 p, equalling their low point
for the year.
They were 118 1/2 p before the interim results statement when the company
also announced it was halving its interim dividend and facing increasing
pressure on profit margins.
On Monday the company had to deny a weekend report that it was in danger of
breaching banking covenants. It then said that, on current projections, it
expected to stay within its covenants, but declined to detail what they
were.
APV has committed itself to announcing details of the restructuring by the
end of December. Yesterday it would say only that, when the scope and size
of the restructuring was known and approved by the board, full details would
be announced to the Stock Exchange.
Last week, the company ousted Mr Clive Strowger, its chief executive,
following pressure from institutional shareholders. Mr Neil French, finance
director, is acting as chief executive.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: US spur puts Siebe in full control / A look
at a Pounds 2.2bn group with a low public profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe, the international controls group, is now one of the UK's largest
engineering companies, with a market capitalisation of Pounds 2.2bn - bigger
than better known names such as Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace.
One reason for the company's relatively low public profile is that almost
all of its products are used within industry or as components for other
manufacturers' goods.
Siebe's output ranges from multi-million pound computerised process control
systems, which manage petrochemical plants, to small, mass-produced
components sold for less than Pounds 1 each.
Another factor is that more than 90 per cent of group sales are made outside
the UK, with nearly half in the US.
Mr Allen Yurko, the 43-year-old American who became chief executive in
January, said North American operations alone would currently be number 233
in the Fortune 500 ranking of US companies.
The Windsor-based company has started to publicise its name and activities
through a press advertising campaign in the UK and the US. British
journalists recently toured group factories near Chicago and Boston.
The main exhibit was Foxboro, the company bought for Dollars 650m (Pounds
411m) in 1990 which is now the star of the controls division. Named after
the small Massachusetts town close to Boston where it is based, Foxboro
makes Intelligent Automation (I/A) systems, which have been gaining market
share from larger US rivals in process control, such as Emerson Electric and
Honeywell.
Foxboro has recently won a string of international orders, including an
Pounds 11m contract to supply its I/A control system for a petrochemical
complex in Germany - the first greenfield refinery to be built in Europe for
15 years.
The main Foxboro plant is controlled by one of its own I/A systems and is
completely computerised - a paperless system monitors, stocks, workflow and
product certification. Direct labour costs have been reduced to 1 per cent
of sales, and sales per employee exceed Dollars 600,000. This compares with
a group average of Pounds 62,200.
The acquisition of Foxboro has proved the deal of a lifetime for Mr Barrie
Stephens, chairman. The 66-year-old Welshman joined the company 31 years ago
and until the beginning of this year combined the role of group chairman and
chief executive
The City of London was initially hostile to the deal. It feared that Siebe,
which had expanded aggressively during the eighties through a flood of
rights issues, had over-reached itself by gearing up to take over a
family-controlled company in the US - the graveyard of so many British
companies.
What Mr Stephens realised was that Foxboro had developed a good product  -
its I/A system - but was struggling under a bloated cost structure. Siebe,
which has always had an aggressive record of cutting costs, found plenty of
scope in an operation which employed 180 people in its public relations
department - a function now fulfilled by three.
Mr Yurko, part of the acquisition team who looked over Foxboro said it was
'a profit waiting to happen. Management was so sleepy. Gross margins were
running at over 45 per cent, but by the time you got down to the bottom line
it was just breaking even.'
With the help of Foxboro, Siebe's controls division achieved sales of Pounds
646m in the year to April - a 22 per cent rise and accounting for 35 per
cent of group sales. In recent years it has cut sales order lead times from
several months to several weeks and improved production quality tenfold.
Although investment analysts and journalists are intrigued by what Mr Yurko
calls 'the sizzle' of the Foxboro operation, the chief executive regrets
that this focus tends to overshadow Siebe's other activities - particularly
its temperature and appliance controls division, which contributes 38 per
cent of group sales.
A more typical Siebe operation is the Paragon factory, which is situated
north of Chicago on the western shore of Lake Michigan.
Paragon, which was acquired in 1989, is a leading supplier of refrigeration
and other appliance controls. Although it is moving away from
electro-mechanical components towards electronic systems, it still carries
out a wide variety of operations in this plant, including old-fashioned
metal-bashing and paint-spraying. Some of the oldest products still in
production - such as mechanical timers - have changed little in 40 years.
It is, however, the trend towards electronic controls which offers the group
its greatest sales opportunity - both in the US and overseas.
Paragon is a leading supplier of automatic defrost controls on fridges,
which are nearly universal in the US but which feature in only 7 per cent of
European fridges.
Siebe's centre of excellence in electronics is the Simicon plant located on
the other side of Lake Michigan, near Grand Rapids.
Simicon, part of the Robertshaw controls company, is located in a
purpose-built factory in which Dollars 7m has been invested. The plant makes
electronic controls for a variety of domestic appliance - particularly
cookers. The company has recently completed controls which allow McDonald's
to programme its ovens by computer.
Each of these plants must, like all of its 133 manufacturing operations
around the world, contribute to Siebe's ambitious growth and productivity
plans. These include annual targets of a 5 per cent cost reduction, 10 per
cent sales growth, 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and 20 per cent
improvement in cashflow.
Mr Yurko said last week in Boston that he was still comfortable about
achieving those targets. The recent concerns about pressures on
manufacturers' profit margins had been overdone. He said: 'We work in
industries which are stable and well run, and which should enable us to make
an adequate return on our capital.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CSI package expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate, is expected to announce
next week details of a restructuring package and an acquisition.
The package is aimed at cutting debt and will include the restructuring of
Pounds 25.7m of convertible preference shares. The planned acquisition would
strengthen the core electronics business.
The shares fell 4p yesterday to 11 1/2 p. Earlier this month they declined
11p to 15 1/2 p in one day when the company failed to announce the expected
package and reported lower sales and operating profit.
Bank of Scotland holds 98 per cent of CSI's preference stock. Outstanding
preference dividends amount to Pounds 4.48m.
The company plans to focus on its electronics division, which contributed
Pounds 2.75m to reduced trading profit from continuing operations of Pounds
1.33m (Pounds 2.88m) in the first half.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Menvier-Swain signals interest in
Scantronic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Menvier-Swain Group, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer,
yesterday signalled its interest in bidding for Scantronic Holdings, a
competitor.
Menvier-Swain purchased 550,000 ordinary shares in Scantronic, raising its
stake to 1.64m shares, or 4.49 per cent of the security components company.
Mr Roger Fletcher, chief executive, said: 'Menvier-Swain has taken this
stake in good faith to demonstrate our genuine interest as a potential
bidder for Scantronic.
'At present we are seeking a serious dialogue with Scantronic's board and we
believe that both sets of shareholders would welcome such a dialogue.'
Scantronic is hoping to raise Pounds 2.8m via borrowings and a placing and
open offer of 16.1m new shares. Last week it forecast pre-tax losses of
about Pounds 2.4m for the half-year to September 30, against Pounds 1.4m
profits previously.
The company has been saddled with increasing debt from acquisitions.
At the end of June it had Pounds 11.2m of debt, against Pounds 3.5m in March
1993. Scantronic announced the resignation of Mr Ray Dias, finance director,
the following month.
The directors do not expect to make any dividend payments, including
preference payments, this year. The shares rose 2 1/2 p to 20p yesterday.
Menvier-Swain increased pre-tax profits by 23 per cent to Pounds 9.36m in
the year to April, on sales of Pounds 70.3m. Its shares closed down 2p at
260p.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Price Waterhouse settles over Carrian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse Hong Kong announced yesterday it had reached an
out-of-court settlement with the liquidator of Carrian Investment, the
conglomerate placed in liquidation in October 1983 with debts of HKDollars
10bn (Pounds 792.7m).
The accountancy firm was accused of professional negligence in failing to
expose fraud within the group and was being sued for an estimated HKDollars
2bn.
The case, brought by liquidator Ernst &amp; Young Hong Kong, had been expected
to last for at least nine months. Both sides have agreed that financial
details of the out-of-court settlement should remain confidential.
In a joint statement the two sides said: 'In agreeing the settlement Price
Waterhouse denies any liability. However, in cases of this complexity it is
often in the interests of both parties to avoid the costs of protracted
litigation.'
The collapse of Carrian, one of Hong Kong's most prominent companies, was
the subject of a HKDollars 100m investigation by the Hong Kong government.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook chief gains time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Montague, chief executive of Tiphook, the container leasing group,
yesterday staved off personal bankruptcy proceedings by winning a 28-day
adjournment to the preliminary hearing due to begin today.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which served a bankruptcy petition on Mr Montague
last month, on debts totalling Pounds 2.3m, confirmed that his solicitors
'had made representations to the court and that an adjournment had been
agreed while negotiations continue'.
Mr Montague has personal debts put at more than Pounds 30m, some of which
are secured on his 1,300-acre estate in Pusey, Oxfordshire, and others on a
139ft luxury yacht.
There had been speculation prior to yesterday's move that Mr Montague would
seek an individual voluntary agreement, a move which would require the
agreement of three-quarters of his creditors. Prominent among these are
Barclays and Commerzbank, the German banking group.
An IVA would involve Mr Montague agreeing a repayment programme with his
creditors, a move which would probably realise more than if he were forced
into bankruptcy.
However, the situation is complicated by the question of which debts are
secured on particular assets. This has so far divided Mr Montague's
creditors.
Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday that it had received no notification
from Mr Montague that he was seeking an IVA, although 'the adjournment
period would allow time for further consultations between the parties.'
It is understood that Mr Montague will return to court to seek an IVA at the
end of the adjournment period.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pressac funds buy with Pounds 10m rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressac, the Nottingham-based manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications
and lighting products, is buying McGavigans, another big UK supplier of
automotive components, for Pounds 9.53m.
The acquisition is being funded with a 1-for-2 rights issue of up to 12.3m
new shares, priced at 85p apiece, to raise Pounds 9.75m. Pressac shares fell
10p to 100p following the announcement.
The takeover of privately-held, Glasgow-based McGavigans is an important
step for Pressac in broadening its components range as the car industry
moves to reduce its supplier base.
McGavigans, established in 1860, makes printed displays for dashboards,
membrane switches for steering wheel horn pads and moulded three-dimensional
displays. Sales and pre-tax profits were Pounds 7.2m and Pounds 937,000
respectively in the six months to August 31.
'It's an obvious fit,' said Mr Geoff White, Pressac's chief executive. For
example, McGavigans makes the front panels for dashboard instrument
clusters, while Pressac makes the printed circuit board that goes
underneath.
Mr White said Pressac would retain McGavigans' Kirkintilloch factory in
Glasgow but may begin manufacturing some of its products in the US, where
the Scottish company's presence is relatively weak.
Pressac also reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds
1.95m to Pounds 2.21m for the year ended July 31, and a raised final
dividend of 2.08p to make a total for the year of 2.83p (2.57p).
It believes the acquisition of McGavigans will have a beneficial impact on
earnings per share in the current year to July 1995. Earnings per share rose
from 4.86p to 5.6p in 1993-94. Overall turnover rose 15 per cent to Pounds
37.9m.
The automotive business was the best performer, with turnover up 33 per cent
to Pounds 18.3m, reflecting improved market share and the introduction of
new products, notably a heated mirror circuit board.
On trading prospects, Mr White said the first quarter of the current year
had started extremely well, especially in the automotive business. Analysts
forecast pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 4.4m.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals drops Pounds 1.49m into the
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Country Casuals yesterday fell 6p to 82p - a record low since its
1992 flotation - after the women's wear group reported interim pre-tax
losses of Pounds 1.49m.
The group blamed the losses on the launch of Elvi, its larger women's brand,
and the expansion of Koto, its fashion chain for younger women.
The results were the first since the departure last month of Mr John
Shannon, chief executive and chairman. Mr Shannon resigned the day after a
profits warning led to the group losing more than a fifth of its market
value.
The deficit for the six months to July 23 compared with profits of Pounds
117,000 last time and Pounds 2.62m for the full year. This was despite a 20
per cent advance in turnover to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 16.5m).
Mr Mark Bunce, chief executive, said: 'We were too ambitious about the size
and speed of the shop opening programme which, with our prudent attitude to
property risks, led to significant delays.'
Elvi reported an operating loss of Pounds 1.59m, with the majority of its 52
stores opening in the second quarter rather than the first as planned. Mr
Bunce said there had been 'too short time a period in order to gather enough
data to project future sales growth.'
Koto, the repackaged chain of 11 stores which were first opened under the
Wild Women name, suffered from leasing problems and incurred an operating
loss of Pounds 605,000 (Pounds 235,000). The company is now considering its
future.
However, the core Country Casuals brand increased operating profits from
Pounds 195,000 to Pounds 323,000.
Mr Tom Adam, chairman, said that like-for-like sales in the 166 shops rose 7
per cent in the first two months of the second half.
Lerose, the manufacturing division, increased operating profits fivefold to
Pounds 261,000 (Pounds 49,000) after attracting more external orders.
Losses per share were 4.97p, against earnings of 0.41p. The interim
dividend, however, is maintained at 1.41p.
COMMENT
Country Casuals has underperformed the sector for almost 18 months, in stark
contrast to Moss Bros, the men's wear retailer, which reported on Monday.
While Country Casuals has been forced to discount its Elvi and Koto stock,
Moss Bros protected its margins and pursued a cautious expansion strategy.
Pre-tax profit forecasts for the full year range widely between Pounds
500,000 and the house broker's Pounds 1.5m, the latter putting the group on
a p/e of about 15 at yesterday's close of 82p. The risk seems more on the
down side.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: The negative aspect of trying to keep all
the equity - Stanhope needs a short-term financial fix to give its principal
asset time to bear fruit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope's struggle for survival is perhaps the last great battle of the
1980s' property boom. The company, under its founder Mr Stuart Lipton, was
responsible for many of the decade's high-profile developments, including
the 3.5m sq ft Broadgate office complex in the City of London.
As Stanhope searches for ways of repaying the Pounds 140m owed to its 16
banks, its fortunes are closely linked with those of Broadgate. The prized
development is Stanhope's main asset, held through its 50 per cent stake in
Broadgate Properties, and the main reason why an outside investor would want
to step in.
As a working environment, there is no doubt that Broadgate is an outstanding
success. It has attracted 20,000 workers to an area of the City previously
considered a backwater.
But as a financial structure, Broadgate already looks dated. It was funded
almost exclusively with bank loans, using non-recourse financing techniques
imported from the US by Mr Godfrey Bradman, chief executive of Rosehaugh,
which owned the other half of Broadgate Properties until its receivership in
1992.
In a rising property market this style of finance was attractive to
developers. By keeping all the equity for themselves, they also hoped to
collect as property values increased.
Mr Bradman is reported to have said: 'You can lose as much on a small
development if it goes wrong as on a major project, but the upside is not
nearly as exciting.'
Yet problems arose when property values started to fall. Despite holding
assets valued at over Pounds 1bn, once debts were deducted, the value of
Broadgate to its shareholders fell to only Pounds 148m at June 30 1993.
With few other assets and Pounds 140m debt of its own, Stanhope showed
negative net worth of Pounds 15.7m at the same date.
Yesterday's results from Broadgate Properties show that the position has
improved. Stanhope should show positive net assets when its results for the
year to the end of June are announced.
Increasing property values also add weight to Mr Lipton's argument that it
would be foolish to sell Broadgate into a rising market.
A forecast commissioned by the company from Jones Lang Wootton, the
surveyors, suggested that rents at Broadgate could rise to Pounds 50 a
square foot by June 1997, from perhaps Pounds 30 a square foot today.
On this assumption, Broadgate Properties' assets might be worth about Pounds
1.3bn in three years' time. If its debts remained at about the same level,
its value to shareholders could quickly rise to Pounds 500m.
While some property professionals regard this forecast as a little
ambitious, most are prepared to concede that Jones Lang Wootton's
expectations for rental growth are not wildly aggressive.
The shortage of prime quality offices in core areas of the City of London
means that space at Broadgate should command a premium price.
In principle, Stanhope's syndicate of 16 lending banks would probably agree
that it would be better to hold on to Broadgate. But while they are
sympathetic towards Mr Lipton's position, their prime interest lies in
having their loans repaid by the December 16 deadline.
Stanhope needs an equity injection to allow this to happen.
The search for a partner willing to invest anything up to Pounds 100m -
codenamed Project Phoenix - started late last year. By February, Stanhope
was close to agreeing terms with an east Asian investor, believed to be
Singapore Land. The plan envisaged Singapore Land taking a 30 per cent stake
in Stanhope through a Pounds 150m rights issue.
Bankers close to the deal say there were even thoughts of buying the other
50 per cent of Broadgate Properties from Rosehaugh's receiver, in which case
the rights issue would have looked to raise anything up to Pounds 260m.
The move in February by British Land, the property company run by Mr John
Ritblat, to buy 30 per cent of Stanhope changed everything. The shares came
to British Land, via Bank of Nova Scotia, from Olympia &amp; York, the failed
Canadian developer responsible for Canary Wharf which bought the stake in
1988.
Stanhope waged a long but ultimately unsuccessful legal battle to prevent
British Land acquiring the shares.
According to Mr Lipton, the episode also scared off his white knight, which
was not prepared to tangle with Mr Ritblat. By the time the legal
proceedings finished in May, Project Phoenix was back to square one.
In a statement earlier this month Stanhope said that it was talking to a
number of interested parties, but that any offer was likely to made at less
than the prevailing 26p share price.
Among those rumoured to have been in negotiations with Stanhope are Morgan
Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which run substantial property funds, and
Chelsfield, the property investment and development company run by Mr
Elliott Bernard.
Mr Ritblat, of course, still has a 30 per cent stake in Stanhope and has
made no secret of his desire to take control of Broadgate.
With the banking deadline looming, the outcome will be determined over the
next few weeks. Stanhope's advisers still hope to find a way of rescuing the
company while at the same time buying the other 50 per cent shareholding in
Broadgate Properties from Rosehaugh's receiver.
Such a deal would increase the value of the assets at a stroke, since the
whole would be worth more than the sum of its parts.
The point is not lost on the banks in Stanhope's syndicate, which also made
loans to Rosehaugh. Through the receiver they already own Rosehaugh's stake
in Broadgate Properties. If Stanhope were to fail they would effectively
have control of the development.
The banks would rather avoid such an outcome. If Stanhope can find a formula
which offers them full repayment - or something close to it - there is every
sign that the relatively small lending syndicate will be supportive.
For shareholders who backed Mr Lipton's vision in the 1980s, though, the
choice is likely to be between accepting little or nothing.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Derivatives broking takes G&amp;N to Pounds 14m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gerrard &amp; National Holdings, the financial group that owns a discount house,
yesterday demonstrated the success of its diversification into stockbroking
and derivatives with a 38 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.4m
to Pounds 14.4m for the six months to September 30.
The rise comes despite difficult trading conditions in fixed interest
markets, which form the core of the traditional discount house activities.
Earnings per share were 16.8p, against 14.6p, reflecting the equity increase
following the May acquisition of GNI Holdings.
The company also announced the first increase in its interim dividend - from
6p to 8p - since 1990. There were no implications for the size of the final
dividend, it said.
G&amp;N's shares rose 16p to close at 454p, with analysts saying the profits
were somewhat better than expected.
For the first time, the company has produced its profits on a segmented
basis and analysts said they had not expected the sharp increase from the
derivatives broking and fund management division.
Pre-tax profits from the operation jumped from Pounds 4.44m to Pounds 10.6m.
'This is a very major and very successful diversification, particularly into
derivatives broking,' said Mr Philip Gibbs at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The sharp rise reflects increased turnover on domestic and foreign futures
exchanges, as well as the relatively high level of performance-related fees
that derivatives fund managers such as GNI are able to achieve.
However, G&amp;N's discount house activities, where it deals as principal, fell
69 per cent from Pounds 4.09m to Pounds 1.27m.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Turnround at Broadgate boosts Stanhope
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The position of Stanhope, the developer which is in refinancing talks with
its banks, improved yesterday with the publication of figures which showed a
healthy increase in the value of its main assets.
Stanhope has been approached by a number of potential investors, including
British Land, headed by Mr John Ritblat, which bought a 30 per cent stake in
February.
Full-year results from Broadgate Properties, in which Stanhope has a 50 per
cent stake, showed that the value of its five buildings in the Broadgate
office complex increased by Pounds 46.7m, or 6 per cent, to Pounds 778m,
during the year to June 30.
The value of the Ludgate development, on the western edge of the City of
London, increased by Pounds 74.5m reflecting both higher property values and
additional development work carried out during the year. Ludgate is now
valued at Pounds 224.4m.
With external debt falling from Pounds 799m to Pounds 788m, the value of
Broadgate Properties to its shareholders increased to Pounds 232m (Pounds
148m). This is split between Stanhope and Rosehaugh, its partner which was
put into receivership in 1992. Analysts estimated the figures would give
Stanhope net assets of about Pounds 10m at its year-end, against negative
net assets of Pounds 15.7m last year.
Turnover fell from Pounds 87.1m to Pounds 69.1m, reflecting lower rental
income following the sales of 175 Bishopsgate and 100 Ludgate Hill, which
raised Pounds 199m to reduce bank borrowings.
Operating profit declined to Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 67.2m) but after the
release of Pounds 25m provisions to reflect the increased value of Ludgate
and lower financing costs, pre-tax profits were Pounds 28.7m against losses
of Pounds 72.5m.
Despite additional lettings at both Broadgate and Ludgate, the company did
not cover its cash financing costs from operational activities. The net cash
inflow from operations for the year was Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 83m) against
cash interest costs of Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 117.5m).
Mr Paul Rivlin, finance director, said that while Broadgate now covered its
financing costs, rent-free periods for tenants at Ludgate meant interest was
rolling up on some loans.
The company has let 393,000 sq ft of office space since June 1993, leaving
vacant only 81,000 sq ft at Broadgate and 58,000 sq ft at Ludgate.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Allied to sell Dutch breweries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allied Domecq, the UK drinks group, is negotiating the sale of its Dutch
brewing subsidiary, known for its Oranjeboom beer, to Interbrew of Belgium.
A successful deal would mark a further consolidation among European brewers.
Interbrew, which brews Stella Artois, would become the second largest brewer
in the Netherlands with almost 16 per cent market share. Heineken has a 50
per cent share and Grolsch has 14 per cent.
Interbrew is currently ranked fifth with 7 per cent, behind Allied Breweries
Netherlands with just under 9 per cent, according to Canadean, the drinks
consultant.
'They will never beat Heineken in its home market, but being a stronger
number two helps,' said one London analyst.
The deal, which the companies hope to complete before the end of the year,
could be worth about BFr4bn (Pounds 80m), analysts estimate. After the sale,
Allied's sole brewing interest, once its mainstay, would be
Carlsberg-Tetley, its UK joint venture with Carlsberg, the Danish brewer.
Allied is concentrating on spirits and wines. This summer it put its
extensive food and beverage businesses up for sale. Analysts estimate they
could be worth up to Pounds 900m.
Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group, confirmed yesterday that it was
interested in DCA Food Industries, Allied's US food ingredients subsidiary,
which could fetch between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m. Heinz of the US and
Grand Metropolitan of the UK are thought to be among other interested
parties.
Allied moved into Dutch brewing in the late 1960s. Its main brewery now is
in Breda, where a relatively modern plant produces 1m barrels (1.63m
hectolitres) of beer a year. It also has a small specialist brewery in
Arcen. The operations generated trading profits of about Pounds 7m in
1993-94.

FT  28 OCT 94 / P&amp;G sues bank over big loss on derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble has filed a lawsuit against Bankers Trust seeking damages
of more than Dollars 130m (Pounds 80m) over a derivative contract that
caused a big loss at the US consumer products giant. The legal action is the
second against the bank over losses stemming from derivatives.
In its lawsuit, P&amp;G claimed the bank did not 'accurately and fully' disclose
information about the derivatives contract. It is claiming Dollars 130m in
compensatory damages, and an unspecified amount of punitive damages.
'Bankers Trust called themselves the experts and encouraged Procter &amp; Gamble
to enter into a transaction we never would have accepted had it been fully
and accurately presented,' Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman, said.
He added: 'There is a notion that end users of derivatives must be held
accountable for what they buy. We agree completely, but only if the terms
and risks are fully and accurately disclosed.'
The most successful and ambitious of the US banks in the derivatives sector
before the turmoil that hit markets earlier this year, Bankers Trust was
sued last month by Gibson Greetings over losses of Dollars 20m it sustained
on derivatives bought from the bank. Derivatives are instruments whose value
is at least partly based on some underlying asset or market.
The P&amp;G suit stems from an interest rate swap contract, under which P&amp;G and
the bank had agreed to exchange payments in the future based on the interest
rates prevailing at the time. The scale of the payments made by each side
would be based on the difference between the yield on five-year and 30-year
US government bond.
Bankers Trust retorted that its actions had been 'legal, proper and
appropriate', adding that P&amp;G knowingly took a risk on the direction of US
interest rates, after extensive discussions between the two sides about the
risks involved.
P&amp;G maintains it entered the contract as part of its normal practice of
using derivatives to reduce exposure to interest-rate changes. The value of
the contract plummeted in early February, when US interest rates were
increased for the first time in four years. P&amp;G terminated the transaction,
leading in part to after-tax losses of Dollars 102m it reported in April.

FT  28 OCT 94 / UAL wants to invest in Chinese airline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UAL, parent of United Airlines, said yesterday that it had an interest in
taking an equity position in China Southern, the country's leading domestic
carrier. But the company stopped short of confirming that it had already
held talks with the Chinese airline on acquiring a stake.
China Southern, based in Guangzhou province, is one of two airlines selected
to be among 22 enterprises traded on overseas stock markets.
Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, is completing arrangements
for the airline's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The Beijing
government has placed a 35 per cent ceiling on foreign investment in its
domestic airlines.
British Airways, which already has established a joint engineering venture
and computer services with China Southern, is also believed to be interested
acquiring a stake in the carrier. It has earned a reputation as one of the
best managed regional airlines in China, with solid prospects for growth.
UAL, which operates the second-largest US airline after American, said its
talks with China Southern were limited to discussions over a possible
marketing agreement, which might also include joint training, maintenance
and related technical services.
The company, which already has scheduled flights into Beijing and Shanghai,
denied published reports that the agenda at its board meeting, held
yesterday in Chicago, included a discussion of United taking a stake in
China Southern.

FT  28 OCT 94 / ICI up 59% in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imperial Chemical Industries yesterday provided confirmation that the
chemicals industry is on the upswing with third-quarter figures that showed
operating profits more than doubling in some divisions. But it warned that
while prices for many of its goods were rising, those 'nearer the consumer',
such as paints, 'remain very competitive'. Its shares fell 12 1/2 p to 786
1/2 p.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, said demand in most markets looked 'more
promising than for some time. Activity in the US, UK and Australian markets
remains generally firm. Recovery in continental Europe appears to be under
way and even the Japanese economy seems to have bottomed. Robust growth in
the rest of the Far East continues.'
Third quarter pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional items, rose 82 per cent
from Pounds 72m to Pounds 131m. Sales for the same period rose 8 per cent
from Pounds 2.16bn to Pounds 2.35bn.
Including exceptional items, such as the costs of closing the Canadian
paints business, pre-tax profits were Pounds 143m, 59 per cent higher than a
year earlier. Earnings per share for the quarter were 11.1p against 7.5p in
1993.
ICI's polyurethane businesses were among the star performers in the third
quarter. The materials division, of which it is a part, saw trading profits
more than quadruple from Pounds 3m to Pounds 14m. Trading profits for the
first nine months were Pounds 61m, compared with Pounds 19m for the same
period of 1993. Third-quarter sales rose from Pounds 386m to Pounds 440m.
ICI's biggest division, industrial chemicals, which includes petrochemicals
and fertilisers, also performed strongly thanks to some 'sharp and swift'
price rises for its products. Third-quarter trading profit rose to Pounds
71m from Pounds 21m as sales edged up from Pounds 902m to Pounds 977m.
Nine-month profits totalled Pounds 180m compared with Pounds 80m in 1993.
The poorest performer was paints, where third-quarter trading profits
climbed from Pounds 34m to Pounds 37m on sales barely changed at Pounds
451m. Paints is one of the ICI's few businesses which sells directly to
consumers. ICI said such businesses 'faced higher raw material costs and a
limited ability to raise selling prices.'
ICI is to spend Pounds 100m on a new plant in the Netherlands to make methyl
diphenyl diisocyanate, a component in polyurethane manufacture.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Credito Italiano targets rival bank
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based bank, is today expected to reject a
L2,000bn (Pounds 800m) offer for 48.2 per cent of its shares by the recently
privatised Credito Italiano. The takeover would create Italy's largest
privately owned bank with deposits exceeding L65,000bn. Credito Italiano is
now the fifth largest and Credito Romagnolo the 15th.
Romagnolo's board will take a formal position today on Credito Italiano's
proposal. Romagnolo management, which is controlled by shareholders
dominated by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti chairman, has refused to
comment formally.
Mr Lucio Rondelli, Credito Italiano's chairman, was quoted as saying: 'I
don't regard the offer as hostile. Indeed we think we can maximise the
synergies with a bank that is complementary to ours.' But a banker familiar
with Romagnolo's position said: 'Credito says the offer is friendly, but
when the Soviet tanks went into Prague they also said they were friendly.'
The offer is for 105.5m shares, valuing them at L19,000 against L13,674 on
Wednesday. Credito Romagnolo shares have risen sharply in recent weeks,
rising more than 20 per cent since mid-September. Credito Italiano admits to
have been one of the buyers and already has 2.5 per cent of Romagnolo
shares.
Romagnolo's statutes forbid any shareholder from owning more than 10 per
cent, in order to preserve a wide ownership base and retain a strong
regional identity rooted in the rich farmlands of Emilia Romagna and the
area's thousands of dynamic small businesses.
Its largest shareholder is France's BNP with 6.8 per cent. The De Benedetti
group has just under 5 per cent. Between 1984-88 there was a fierce struggle
for control of the bank when a De Benedetti co-ordinated alliance fought off
takeover attempts by the Fiat group and the Agnelli family. There are also
some 28,000 small shareholders.
Since privatisation earlier this year Credito Italiano has come under the
effective control of Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank headed by
Mr Enrico Cuccia.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Usinor returns to profit in first half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Usinor Sacilor, Europe's largest steel producer, has returned to profit in
the first half after suffering losses of FFr5.7bn (Pounds 680m) in 1993.
Mr Francis Mer, chairman, said that the French state-owned group, which is
on the list of 21 public sector companies slated for sale by the government,
achieved net profits of FFr471m in the first six months, against a loss of
FFr2.59bn in the first half of 1993. Sales rose from FFr39.74bn to
FFr39.84bn.
The return to profit by one of the biggest loss-makers in the French public
sector partly reflects recovery in the international steel industry after
two years of recession. The revival was one of the main reasons that the
European Commission this week abandoned its plan to cut steel capacity.
Mr Mer forecast a continued improvement in demand and prices for steel and
said that the full impact of these trends would be felt in the second half.
Profits were also boosted by a FFr900m exceptional gain from the flotation
of a 40 per cent stake in Ugine, the stainless steel division. Proceeds from
the operation also helped reduce the group's debt from FFr24.4bn at the
beginning of the year to FFr20.26bn at the end of June. For the first time
in four years, Usinor's net debts are less than shareholders' equity.
According to Usinor, operating results are now near break-even. But it said
that losses suffered by Unimetal, which makes wires and steel for engineered
products, continued to undermine the company's overall performance.
Usinor has been implementing a restructuring plan to cut its borrowings,
eliminate loss-making activities, and achieve sustainable profitability.
Earlier this month, the company said it was negotiating the sale of its SAM
steel reinforcements operation to ASW holdings of the UK.
Mr Mer also outlined plans for a special steels division which would group
its Unimetal, Ascometal and CLI units, pooling research and development
costs. The restructuring is aimed at preparing Usinor for privatisation. A
sale is not imminent, as Usinor needs to reduce its debts and other
candidates, including the Assurances Generales de France insurance concern
and Seita, the tobacco company, are being primed for sell-off.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Gadget sellers feel the squeeze: Toys for yuppies lose
allure as age of frivolity passes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shoppers are used to sales patter - autumn bargains, end-of-season discounts
and the like. But one UK chain has begun wooing customers with a different
campaign, the 'Takeover Clearance Sale'.
The Leading Edge, purveyors of gadgets and gimmicks, is selling off surplus
stock in a farewell to the unrestrained consumerism of the 1980s, when
demand surged for useful but unnecessary products such as talking pens,
battery-powered sponges and laser-guided golfing aids.
Described by one retail analyst as a 'requiem to the boom', the move follows
the disposal of The Leading Edge by Kleen-e-ze Holdings, the home shopping
group, which tried and failed to use its successful mail order operations to
support a retail chain.
As Kleen-e-ze found to its cost, impulse purchases of executive toys and
gadgets have all but dried up. One only has to look around boardrooms to
know the age of the gadget is waning, say retail analysts. Rare is the
executive whose desk now boasts a clock 'accurate to within one second in a
million years'.
In the US too, the disaffection with items such as watches that double as TV
remote controls has forced Sharper Image, the San Francisco-based gadget
manufacturer and retailer, to switch to more practical products.
'We got over-confident and let our catalogue and merchandise get stale,'
said Mr Richard Thalheimer, the group's chairman and self-proclaimed 'PT
Barnum of gadgetry'.
While Kleen-e-ze was struggling to extract a profit from The Leading Edge,
Sharper Image saw its profits falter as consumers stopped buying products
such as the Personal Life Clock, which ticks down the owner's life
expectancy. 'We found we could not compete with the warehouse stores, so
we've moved into more practical products, particularly in healthcare,' said
one Sharper Image executive.
Even under the auspices of healthy living, the company still offers some
bizarre accessories - the wrist-worn Snore Control System upsets the
offender's sleep patterns when the noise reaches unacceptable volumes.
Kleen-e-ze and Sharper Image have pursued different strategies to overcome
the problems facing gadget makers.
The UK company decided to withdraw from high street retailing after a
two-year restructuring. It has focused instead on mail order and has
captured a sizeable slice of the market for catalogues offering everyday
items ranging from cordless kettles to thermal gloves. It also handles
catalogues for Britain's Science and Natural History Museums, where
solar-powered clocks and pocket 'stellarscopes' are more likely to find
buyers.
Sharper Image, meanwhile, acted to restore market confidence by buying back
its own shares in August. Its shares have risen 31 per cent, while
Kleen-e-ze shares fell 17 per cent since it sold its retail outlets.
Mr Klein, however, has no regrets. He is determined to focus on home
shopping. 'Management time and working capital can now be concentrated on
our growing business - Kleen-e-ze Homecare and Innovations.'
Sharper Image is also increasing its catalogue activities, which have grown
faster than over-the-counter operations.
'Both companies have tried to tailor the product to being more practical and
less gadgety,' says one analyst. 'But they still rely on impulse purchases
for a large proportion of their profits, and I'm afraid that era is over.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Westminster council made house repairs worth Pounds 12m 'for
free'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster City Council has failed to charge its leaseholders for Pounds
12m of repair costs since 1988, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy claims in its journal Public Finance today.
People who bought their properties either under the Tories' right-to-buy
legislation or as part of the council's controversial designated sales
policy, currently under investigation by the district auditor, had major
repair work carried out for free.
The council said it had instigated its own investigation into the backlog of
charges and was seeking legal advice. It said: 'There have been concerns
over procedure. It may be that the report highlights inefficiency.'
Labour councillors claimed yesterday that the council had been guilty of
'appalling negligence and incompetence' and suggested that the officers
responsible could be liable to be surcharged.
Ms Jill Selbourne, who speaks for the Labour group on housing, told Public
Finance: 'The housing revenue account, that is the tenants, are paying for
all this scandalous behaviour (the failure to charge for repairs earlier).
This is surchargeable. Somebody, somewhere, is responsible for this via
negligence.'
Cipfa's journal says the surcharge could be as much as Pounds 22m, once lost
interest on the charges which should have been collected is taken into
account.
However, Labour councillors did not claim yesterday that there is any link
with the alleged use of the designated sales policy to 'gerrymander' the
council's housing stock by selling properties in electorally marginal wards
to potential Tory voters.
Westminster also emphatically denied any links with alleged gerrymandering,
saying: 'This is not the result of a corrupt policy.'
Mr Bill Roots, the council's chief executive, told Public Finance: 'We have
a major issue which goes back a number of years. We have taken copious legal
advice on what we can do.
'We have tried to weigh up the council's responsibilities and roles to
lessees as opposed to its wider responsibilities.'
Mr John Magill, the district auditor leading the investigation into the
'homes for votes' allegations, has qualified the council's accounts for
1993-94. He told the journal: 'Preliminary findings suggest that there has
been a significant under-recovery of costs over several years.'
Ms Selbourne adds in the journal that the council's legal advice on whether
the charges could be recovered from leaseholders was 'contradictory'. The
consensus of five legal opinions sought by the council indicated that it
would only be able to recover 18 months of charges, she said.
Mr Peter Bradley, another Labour councillor, said yesterday the backlog in
charges would be a 'major shock' to leaseholders, who now faced 'enormous
bills' of up to Pounds 20,000.
He said one leaseholder in his ward had already been 'presented with a bill
for Pounds 12,000', which she could not afford.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Russian government survives vote of no confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government survived a vote of no confidence in parliament last
night as Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, pledged to toughen
economic policy next year to achieve the elusive goal of stabilisation.
The country also survived the first part of a 24-hour strike called by the
official trade unions with little apparent inconvenience, and relatively
small demonstrations in the main cities.
However, the no confidence vote - 194 for, just 32 short of the majority
needed - was closer than expected, and only 54 deputies voted against it.
The rest registered abstentions or did not vote at all.
At the same time, President Boris Yeltsin named the conservative Mr
Alexander Nazarchuk, a leading member of the pro-communist Agrarian faction,
as the agriculture minister.
The nomination and its likely effect on the vital, but largely
unreconstructed, agricultural sector contrasted starkly with the prime
minister's reformist speech as he presented his tough 1995 draft budget to
parliament. It appeared to point again to a widening policy split between Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, Democratic party leader and minister without portfolio,
said last night 'if before this nomination we couldn't move reforms through
the (farm) lobby, then after it they will be entirely stuck'.
However, Mr Chernomyrdin, in a confident and vigorous performance before the
Duma, made clear that the only strategy he could see was to tighten monetary
policy, squeeze inflation further and refuse additional credits from the
Central Bank.
The budget commended by Mr Chernomyrdin is exceptionally severe, requiring
real cuts in almost every sphere of the economy and making a continuing fall
in production and GNP inevitable.
However, Mr Chernomyrdin said that only such a budget would 'close the doors
on the swamp of depression' and allow real growth backed by real investment.
The leaders of the reformist parties were at best lukewarm in their support
 -though both Mr Grigory Yavlinsky of the Yabloko group, a declared
presidential candidate in next year's elections, and Mr Yegor Gaidar of
Russia's Choice made clear that their opposition was more to the president
than to Mr Chernomyrdin.
While the unions' grievances about the backlog of wages owing are real and
urgent, neither the old official unions nor the new independent ones have
managed to galvanise workers into action.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Mayhew cautious over Ulster talks framework
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday warned that the
government might be unable to agree with Dublin on a document to form the
basis of a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick's note of caution came as Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, attacked London for 'consistently trying to
reduce the momentum of the peace process'.
Meanwhile, Mr Mitchel McLoughlin, another senior Sinn Fein figure, warned
that the process could break down if London insisted on paramilitary groups
surrendering their weapons before agreement on political structures was in
sight.
These latest indications of the difficulty of the path ahead came on the eve
of Sinn Fein's first meeting with the Republic's main political parties in
the Dublin-based Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.
Speaking in Dublin, Mr Adams dismissed the government's Irish policy as
'crisis management' and accused it of trying to avoid the political and
constitutional change that was 'fundamental to a lasting peace settlement'.
Sir Patrick told the first House of Commons debate on the province since the
IRA and loyalist ceasefires that he greatly hoped London and Dublin would
reach agreement but 'it is not certain'.
His tone was less upbeat than that of Mr John Major, the prime minister, who
met Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, at Chequers on Monday. Mr
Major said after the talks that both were 'confident of being able to reach
agreement'.
Sir Patrick reaffirmed the government's readiness to hold preliminary talks
with republican leaders by the end of the year if London could continue
'reasonably' to assume Sinn Fein was 'establishing a commitment to
exclusively peaceful methods'.
They would 'embrace the Republicans' proposals for depositing and
de-commissioning their armaments', he said.
Sir Patrick sought to reassure Unionists by saying there were no
circumstances in which security would be reduced to a level below that
needed to counter the threat of 'terrorist crime'. He hinted that the army
would not pull out of the province entirely.
Meanwhile, Dublin yesterday sought to play down the significance of a
disclosure in yesterday's Financial Times that it had suggested draft
amendments to article 2 of its constitution, defining Ulster as part of the
republic's 'national territory'. Dublin said the reports were 'two or three
months out of date'.
The issue of article 2 was not raised at Chequers, an Irish spokesman said.
'At no stage has the British government asked the Irish government to define
the nation in any way that would have left the Unionists out of the Irish
nation.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese electronics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's electronics industry is enjoying a good year. Yesterday's first-half
results from a batch of the largest groups - NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Toshiba
and Mitsubishi Electric - were not only much improved on the first half of
1993; in most cases, they comfortably exceeded expectations. But the overall
progress hides two rather different stories: profits from the 'upstream'
components businesses, notably semiconductors, raced ahead; but there was
continuing disappointment in the 'downstream' markets, particularly
audio-visual products.
The upstream business is being driven by the explosion in sales of personal
computers, especially in the US. Worldwide demand for chips should continue
to grow strongly next year with the shift to more memory-hungry programs and
multimedia gadgetry. Because of high operational gearing, the increase in
demand has a disproportionately large effect on industry profits.
Downstream, the outlook is less bright. Demand for consumer electronics
products inside Japan is slack, prices are depressed and the industry is
suffering competition from cheap imports.
The progress upstream more than compensates for the disappointment
downstream. The quality of earnings from semiconductors is high: chip prices
are fairly firm and the competitive advantage of Japanese industry in the
memory chip market looks sustainable in the medium term. The one concern is
that the industry was so keen not to repeat the 1980s mistake of
over-investing in new chip capacity that it may now be unable to satisfy the
soaring demand.

FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Italian banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's fragmented banking sector certainly needs rationalisation. But one
wonders whether Credito Italiano's L2,000bn bid for 48 per cent of Credito
Romagnolo is the right way of achieving it. Recently-privatised Italiano is
still suffering from its public-sector past. Its return on assets at 1.39
per cent in 1993 was much lower than Romagnolo's 2.25 per cent. In a
rational world, more efficient institutions would take over their less
efficient rivals, not the reverse.
Those who bought shares at the time of Italiano's privatisation last year
cannot be too pleased. The share price had slumped following last month's
announcement of a L1,520bn capital-raising. Yesterday, the shares fell
further and are now nearly 25 per cent below the privatisation issue price.
Investors may be puzzled why Italiano is issuing its own shares at a
discount to net assets, while bidding for Romagnolo's at a premium.
Observers detect the hand of Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant
bank. It effectively controls Italiano and is keen to extend its influence
in the commercial banking sector. Mediobanca also controls Banca Commerciale
Italiana, another newly-privatised bank that recently raised L1,575bn for
its own acquisition war-chest. Unsurprisingly, the market is betting BCI
will launch its own banking bid, Ambroveneto being the favoured target. With
its shares now almost 40 per cent below the privatisation price, BCI
investors are also paying for their management's excessive ambition.

FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK tourism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An industry where revenues grew by almost 13 per cent a year between 1985
and 1992 would appear to be in good health. But the British Tourist
Authority is not satisfied. It points out that, while the UK is still sixth
in the destination league, its share of world tourism has been declining
steadily. Rather than accepting this as inevitable - since less developed
destinations are likely to grow faster - the authority believes the loss of
market share can be tackled with a little more public money.
Given the jobs created by tourism, it might well be desirable if Britain
could keep pace with world market growth. It is less clear that it is
physically possible. At present levels of spending per head, such growth
would mean visitor numbers rising more than 50 per cent by 2001. However
successful the efforts to tempt visitors to travel out of season to less
congested areas, there must be some doubt whether the system will be able to
cope. The answer may be to concentrate less on numbers and more on
increasing spending per head. For companies such as Forte or British
Airways, it is quality rather than quantity that counts. The priority for
the industry as a whole should be to improve the quality and range of
facilities it offers. Due to the impact of the recession on room rates,
British hotels are less uncompetitive than they were. But they still suffer
from relatively high costs. For many, the best strategy may be to move
further upmarket.

FT  28 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Chemical attraction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that this year's strong demand growth for commodity chemicals was
merely restocking were confounded yesterday by ICI's third-quarter results.
The figures were unusually strong, even for this stage of the cycle. Heady
demand in Asia and the US has led to a change in trade flows, reducing
imports into Europe and increasing exports. With rising world demand and
limited new supply, prices should rise sharply. Spot commodity chemical
prices have already increased, though ICI is yet to benefit fully because
contract price rises have only just started coming through. These will be
driven still higher when European domestic demand, which has so far remained
weak, really recovers. ICI's downstream businesses, such as paints, may
suffer from raw material cost inflation. But such pressures should be more
than offset by commodity chemicals.
The question remains whether ICI is fairly valued. The issue is one of
timing. When its earnings peak, ICI's shares will stand at a discount as
investors anticipate the cyclical downturn. But with possible earnings
growth next year of 50 per cent, selling now would be a mistake. The
chemical industry typically suffers from supply-driven not demand-led
recessions. So the right moment to sell will be when capital expenditure
reaches unsustainable levels. Four years ago, the group's capital
expenditure was Pounds 1bn compared with depreciation of just Pounds 525m -
a clearly unsustainable ratio of nearly two. Last year ICI's ratio was 0.9,
suggesting there is a long way to go before over-capacity once again becomes
a problem.

FT  28 OCT 94 / The FT Interview: The discreet intermediary - King Hassan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An 'economic summit' in Morocco, over a thousand miles away, may seem a
cruel irrelevance to relatives of those killed or maimed by last week's bus
bomb in Tel Aviv, or to Palestinians thrown out of work by the indefinite
sealing off of the Gaza Strip. But King Hassan II, who will open the Middle
East economic summit in Casablanca on Sunday, believes it is highly
relevant.
'Peace is not just a paper that you sign,' he says. 'Peace must have a
content. It must forge common interests which put it beyond the reach of a
new flare-up. The peace process has no meaning or reality unless it is
accompanied by an economic development pro-cess.'
This is not, he adds, a purely theoretical or long-term vision. He believes
the Casablanca conference, to be attended by executives from leading
multinational companies as well as heads of state and government, can and
must 'provide answers in the short term which will change the everyday life
of people in the region'.
It must, he says, 'get across to political and business leaders both that
this region has a formidable potential once peace is established, and that
it has a desperate need for capital and jobs, which alone can make the peace
process meaningful to the great majority of its people'.
The 63-year-old king, interviewed in the slightly incongruous setting of his
royal stables and stud farm, is no newcomer to the Middle East peace
process. He has acted as a discreet intermediary in contacts between Israel
and its Arab neighbours, and notably between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organi-sation.
Last week, in a ground-breaking interview with Israeli television, King
Hassan said Morocco had a special relationship with Israel, based on its
continuing links with 600,000 Jews of Moroccan origin 'whom I consider my
children even if today they reside in Israel'. An Israeli 'liaison office'
in Rabat is to be opened today, as a step towards formal diplomatic
relations.
Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat will both be in Casablanca on Sunday, despite the
tension between them caused by the violence of Hamas, the Palestinian
Islamic resistance group. Well aware of the threat this violence poses to
the peace process, King Hassan says he was not surprised by the Tel Aviv
explosion. He thinks it may well be repeated, and both sides should be ready
for that.
But this, he says, is a reason to accelerate the peace process, not slow it
down. A rapid move ahead to 'the second phase, in which the Israeli army
will be redeployed and the PLO's administrative authority will no longer be
confined to the Gaza Strip and the island of Jericho', would enable Israel
and the PLO to work together more effectively to combat violence.
'The longer you confine this entity to such a small surface,' he explains,
'the more the dangers will multiply. It's like a theorem in physics: if you
have a pressure of 1,000kg on a surface of one square centimetre, it's more
dangerous than the same pressure distributed over two square metres.'
The scientific simile is typical of a monarch who is determined to modernise
his country, seeing no contradiction in the fact that his authority derives
from centuries-old tradition and from religious faith. His only fear, he
says, is that 'change is coming too slowly', and that 'if we do not change,
Morocco may fall victim to its own administrative routine'. The younger
Moroccan entrepreneurs look to him for support in taking on vested interests
and opening the country fully to foreign competition and investment.
Some say Morocco has actually benefited from the violent conflict between
military repression and Islamic extremism in neighbouring Algeria: Moroccans
are more aware that a liberal monarchy enjoying Islamic legitimacy is a
precious asset. All the king will say in public on this subject is that
'Morocco is Morocco and Algeria is Al-geria'.
In other contexts he stresses Morocco's advantage in having 'existed as a
state for 1,200 years'. And he brushes aside any idea of a clash of
civilisations between Islam and the west. 'On the cultural level,' he
declares, 'the west and the Moslem world have contributed equally to world
culture . . . We are just as cultivated as the west, and we will never clash
with it on the level of culture or of civilisation.'
Politically, however, King Hassan is far from satisfied with the current
performance of western Europe. He says he is 'very sceptical' about the
latest grand design from Brussels for a Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area.
'I'm a bit like St Thomas,' he says. 'I like to see before I believe. We've
had so many promises from Europe. But Europe is expanding. It's trying to
digest mentalities and social structures which are different from its own.
It's trying to deal with everything at once, and with itself. That's why I
don't feel so much resentment towards Europe: it is searching for itself.'
Resentment shows through, all the same, and the irony gets heavier when he
speaks of the different approaches the EU takes to its eastern and southern
neighbours - the former being identified as future members of the Union,
whereas his own application in 1987 (which he now admits he himself 'did not
really believe in either') was laughed out of court.
'That doesn't hurt me,' he claims, 'because I think Europe remains an entity
with a certain memory. They think of themselves as the whites, the
colonisers, while we are the former colonies. We are not full citizens. We
supposedly have no scholars - and yet we do have them. We have no great
professors - and yet we do have them . . .
'And so they look for allies more to the east, because there people are
white, . . . because it's one big family. And then they look across the
Mediterranean and say: 'Ah yes, it's true, there are those poor little
people that we colonised . . .' '
Religion, the king insists, plays no part in it. 'It's still the memory of
the European colonial past which is at work.' In the last century, he points
out, Europe produced a galaxy of scholars 'who had a perfect knowledge of
Islam and of Moslem civilisation'. If Europe now fears Islam and associates
it with violence, that is due to 'a regression on the European cultural
level'.
Yet he admits that 'there are faults on both sides', and he is hoping to
improve matters through Ifrane University, Morocco's first private
university, which will open its doors to Moroccan and foreign students in
January. 'Inspired by American teaching methods', this will be 'open to all
revealed religions'. But the students, paying a maximum fee of Dollars 5,000
a year, will be expected 'to specialise in an Islamic subject', as well as
study technology and science, including economics and business studies, at
the highest international level. By the end of a three or four-year course
they will 'look at Islam in a new way', and will spread its 'real image' on
their return to their own coun-tries.
The languages of instruction at Ifrane will be English and Arabic, and the
choice of English in preference to French is significant. One of the
colonial legacies King Hassan and his countrymen are most anxious to escape
from is what they see as a constricting tete a tete with Latin European
culture.
Perhaps for this reason, he is disappointed at the lack of official UK
interest in the Casablanca summit. France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and
Austria will be represented by their heads of government, and the US by
secretary of state Warren Christopher. Britain is sending only Mr Douglas
Hogg, minister of state at the Foreign Office, rather than Prime Minister
John Major or foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd.
'I should have liked Mr Major or Mr Hurd to come in person,' says King
Hassan wistfully. 'After all, Great Britain has always been present in the
Middle East, and it was with us in Morocco that she had her first commercial
treaties.'

Earlier this year Andy Allan, chief executive of Carlton UK Television,
raised eyebrows by refusing to let MPs see an untransmitted investigation
into controversial parliamentary lobbyists Ian Greer Associates and then
abandoning the programme.
Allan is out of luck again, this time over footage of MP David Mellor.
Mellor was to feature in another programme as an example of an MP with
considerable extra-parliamentary interests. Allan has supported Carlton TV
managing director Paul Jackson's decision not to use footage which Mellor
feared might depict him as 'shifty and evasive'.
The programme-makers threatened to leave a 30-second black hole where Mellor
would have appeared. But Independent Television's network centre  - has
refused to broadcast a programme with a hole in it. Carlton TV has now
decided to show old footage of Mellor in the House of Commons. The
programme-makers are still sulking and threatening to have their names
removed.

Believe it or not, a former Swiss cabinet minister is refusing to accept the
juicy SFr190,000 pension to which he is entitled.
Rudolf Friedrich, who is best known for a 1982 law that bears his name and
which restricts the sale of Swiss property to foreigners, says he does not
need the money. The 71-year-old Friedrich says he also feels uncomfortable
because he had to resign for health reasons after being in the cabinet only
22 months.
Not so much sleazing as pleasing.

What do ex-UK chancellor Lord Howe and his former Indian counterpart
Ramaswamy Venkataraman have in common? Their published memoirs have caused
political ripples.
The two men exchanged a mischievous smile at the London launch this week of
Venkataraman's autobiography, which has already caused a big stink in Delhi.
Venkataraman, who - after a stint at the finance ministry - became
president, is the first Indian head of state to go into the memoir business.
Lord Howe slipped his friend a copy of his own memoirs, before recalling his
letter of congratulation on Venkataraman's elevation to the presidency: 'If
a cat may greet a king, an ex-finance minister can greet a president.'
Baffling stuff.

The chattering classes in the City of London know all about PosTel boss
Alastair Ross Goobey, 48, and Matthew Oakeshott, 47, co-founder of Olim
money managers. Both learnt their trade managing the Courtaulds pension
fund. However, few have heard of the man who came before and after them  -
John Evans, 59, who steps down at the end of the year.
Of the three, Evans probably turned in the best long-term performance.
During his stint on the bridge, the fund has outperformed its peer group by
about 1 1/2 per cent a year. Might sound peanuts, but it is the equivalent
of nearly Pounds 20m a year, or about a tenth of Courtaulds' profits. Rather
than a gold watch for 28 years' service, perhaps Courtaulds should reward
Evans with a performance-related pension?

Alan Rothenberg, the ambitious Los Angeles lawyer and chief organiser of
this year's US football World Cup, probably has a few mixed feelings right
now.
While he can glory in the fact that the tournament earned a profit of
Dollars 60m - twice the original estimates and by far the most money ever
generated by a World Cup - and bask in the approval of Fifa, international
football's governing body, not everything is going to plan.
Fifa gave the tournament to the US in the hope that it would spread the
gospel in the last great territory unconquered by the game.
That evangelism has been cast on stony ground. Fifa wanted the US World Cup
to boost a new US professional outdoor football league, known as Major
League Soccer. The MLS is due to kick off in April 1995. But so far only
seven cities have agreed to host an MLS team, leaving five of the spots
unfilled. It seems big investors and corporate sponsors are shying away, and
MLS may not have enough money to make its debut. Rothenberg has hinted that
MLS's opening may be delayed until 1996. He has to make his mind up in the
next 10 days.
If MLS fails to appear in 1995 the US Soccer Federation - president, Alan
Rothenberg - could be covered in embarrassment. Mind you, he can comfort
himself with Dollars 7m in pay and bonuses, awarded to him last week for
organising the 1994 World Cup.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mozambique poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
First Angola, now - it seems - Mozambique. The last-minute decision by Mr
Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the former rebel Renamo movement, to boycott
Mozambique's first multi-party elections is a potentially devastating
setback to hopes for a lasting peace in the country, as well as a blow to
the wider vision of a stable southern Africa.
Mr Dhlakama's claim that 'massive fraud' left him with no other choice is
far from convincing. The presence of a 7,000-strong United Nations
monitoring force, as well as some 2,000 international observers, may not be
enough to guarantee an election entirely free of abuse. But it should be
enough to detect irregularities on a large scale.
Yet the proper response to Mr Dhlakama and his party is not suppression.
Renamo, dismissed by many as no more than a creation of white Rhodesia and
subsequently adopted by minority-ruled South Africa, has proved surprisingly
resilient. Its support cannot simply be explained by intimidation,
notwithstanding its atrocities during the civil war.
It has been able to exploit ethnic and regional differences and, not least,
hark back to the dismal record of the ruling Frelimo party, now led by
President Joaquin Chissano, in its early years in government. Frelimo's
nationalisation programme proved disastrous, its approach to government
authoritarian until it accepted multi-party elections two years ago, and its
own human rights record far from clean.
If pressure from southern African states and western governments can make Mr
Dhlakama change his mind, the election can be put back on track by extending
voting over one or two more days.
The chances of Mr Dhlakama changing his mind seem slim, however. Mr
Chissano, the likely winner even had Renamo participated in the poll, should
seek to defuse Renamo's challenge by making clear that irrespective of the
outcome of the poll he will form a coalition administration.
There is no significant ideological difference betwen the two parties. Any
conceivable government would have to carry on with reconstruction of the
country under the World Bank's structural adjustment programme. Further,
such is the country's acute shortage of skills, it simply does not have the
personnel now to sustain a conventional opposition.
Allocating an appropriate share of government posts to Renamo will be
difficult, especially since Mr Dhlakama has deliberately removed the only
reliable way of gauging his support. Distaste at his tactics should not,
however, deter his opponents and the western donors on whose support
Mozambique depends from seeking some accommodation.
Renamo possesses the capacity to destabilise post-election Mozambique as the
rebel Unita movement did Angola. Accepting it in a government of national
unity would be a small price to pay for averting a renewed civil war.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Leading the WTO
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Regionalism and protectionism are the greatest threats to the multilateral
trading system. Inevitably, they are also creating the chief dangers to
ratification of the Uruguay Round outcome, and to selection of a suitable
first head of the World Trade Organisation.
Ratification has not proved as easy as was hoped when the round was finished
in Marrakesh last April. So far only 30 nations have ratified. The decision
to set December 8 as the date for the formal implementation conference rests
on the assumption that the US, the European Union and Japan at least will
have done so by then.
In the US, however, the lame-duck Congress will have to return for a special
session after November's midterm elections. But Ross Perot, the Texas
billionaire, has already called for delay, while protectionists of left and
right are on the attack. Meanwhile, EU ratification has been delayed by a
dispute over the powers of the European Commission to speak for member
states, to be resolved by the European Court of Justice on November 15.
The US administration believes that a possibly bitter international dispute
over who should lead the WTO could threaten ratification. If so,
ratification must come first, since failure could mark an end to commercial
diplomacy at a global level.
That said, selection of the head of the WTO should ideally happen this year,
if the organisation is to get off to a good start next January.
Unfortunately, however, an inter-regional combat has now emerged between
President Carlos Salinas of Mexico, Mr Renato Ruggiero of Italy and South
Korea's trade minister, Mr Kim Chul-su.
This is a destructive way to proceed, as has been demonstrated by the
stalemate over who should be the next secretary general of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.
One problem with so public a combat is that, in the absence of an accepted
electoral procedure, any one region will find it humiliating to abandon its
own candidate for the candidate of another. Consequently, compromise will
become difficult, if not impossible. More important, however, is the fact
that the regional origin of the new head is quite unimportant. Or do the
combatants fear that Mr Ruggiero would be more sympathetic to the European
Union, Mr Salinas more friendly towards the US, or Mr Kim more supportive of
Japan? If that were indeed so, a quasi-judicial body like the WTO would be
dead.
What is required is a person dedicated to global liberal trade, who also
possesses high intellectual attainments and diplomatic skills. After
ratification, the major players should get together quietly to decide who
would make the best job of the WTO (and they need not restrict themselves to
one of the three candidates). They have the best possible reason for doing
so as objectively as possible. The WTO is their baby. They should want it to
succeed.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Good news from Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit where credit is due. Back in July, the election of a new Ukrainian
president offered a chance, nothing more, that the country's government
might finally start to get things right. President Leonid Kuchma promised a
radical programme of economic reforms to reverse the dismal economic record
of the previous three years. Whereupon, the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries pledged Dollars 4bn to help him. So far, Mr Kuchma is
delivering on his promise: so must the G7.
Mr Kuchma was in Winnipeg yesterday to argue the case for receiving Dollars
900m to fill the gap in Ukraine's fourth-quarter balance of payments. His
claim is that, with the promise of International Monetary Fund support
arranged late last month, the country is now set on a programme of reforms
which will turn it around. But it needs help to ease the pain of this 'shock
therapy'.
Mr Kuchma is not the first leader to make such claims, but a number of steps
taken in the past few weeks provide reasons to take him at his word. Taken
together, these measures begin to tackle the heart of Ukraine's economic
problems: the trade balance.
Yesterday's unification of the exchange rate removes a sizeable tax on all
exporters' activities. At the same time, the announced reform of many
agricultural prices should, if implemented, begin to encourage a recovery in
the area, which is the country's best hope for export success.
Weighing heavily, as ever, on the import side of the ledger is the country's
chronic reliance on imported energy supplies. In the medium term, this will
continue to be a problem, but plans are now in place to bring domestic
energy prices up to world levels by the middle of next year. This will at
least encourage more efficient use of energy, although ultimately the bulk
of improvements in the trade balance will have to come from exports.
For all the encouraging signs, much could still go wrong with the Ukrainian
economy. Many of the recently announced measures still require parliament's
approval if they are to be implemented. So far, however, parliament has been
less obstructive than many feared. The bigger question marks are external.
In the medium term, the country will not be able to stay afloat without help
from Russia. A willingness to help Ukraine, by offering a grace period in
the repayment of its hefty arrears, has rightly been seen as a test of
Russia's acceptance of Ukraine as a truly independent state. On Tuesday,
President Yeltsin expressed himself willing, in principle, to consider a
three-to-seven year grace period.
In truth, it is in Russia's own interest to see success in Ukraine, since an
unstable Ukraine risks destabilising Russian politics. Helping Ukraine is in
the G7's interest too, but it is in a better position to help. The IMF has
decided to bet on Mr Kuchma. The G7 should back it up by pledging to help
Ukraine pay its oil bills now, not merely next year.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Europe looks for southern comfort: Links with N Africa and
the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union leaders are expected to bless a plan to embrace North Africa
and the Middle East in a free trade zone, at their next summit at Essen in
Germany this December.
The EU is tantalised by the prospect of peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbours, and terrified of social and political collapse in Algeria, which
could trigger mass emigration and spread to the rest of the Maghreb. At
last, therefore, the EU is beginning to think strategically about the
southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean.
The ambition - and it certainly is ambitious - is to create a
Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area, helped by more than doubling EU aid to
enable participants to restructure their economies.
The proposal, launched by the European Commission last week, is akin to the
European Economic Area, set up with the European Free Trade Association
(Efta) this year. Over time, Euro-Med would increase the intensity of EU
relations with its southern neighbours to a level approaching that now
reserved for the states of eastern Europe.
The obvious difference is that up to four of the Efta partners (Austria,
Finland, Sweden and Norway) are set to join the Union next year, and the
central Europeans should start coming in around the turn of the century, led
by Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. There is no question of EU entry
for the Union's future Euro-Med partners.
But there is another vital difference: the size of the wealth gap between
the EU and its southern neighbours. According to the Commission, average per
capita income in the Union in 1992 was Dollars 19,942; in the countries of
the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) and Mashraq (Egypt,
Jordan, Lebanon and Syria) it was Dollars 993. This gap is far wider than,
for instance, that between average incomes in the US and Mexico, which were
joined early this year under the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta), the first attempt to yoke developed and developing economies.
Even if output in the Arab Middle East and North Africa doubled between now
and 2010 - the target date for a full Euro-Med free trade zone - the income
gap would have widened much further, and possibly doubled, because of high
population growth, according to the World Bank.
It has taken Europe inordinate time to wake up to this, but now that it has,
it is unsurprising to see the Commission's proposal loaded with adjectives
such as urgent, fast, vital, rapid. 'At present, political, economic and
social conditions in a number of these countries are sources of instability
leading to mass migration, fundamentalist extremism, terrorism, drugs and
organised crime,' says the Commission's document.
Thus, at one level, what is being advocated is a strategy of containment.
In intra-EU terms, a signal is being sent to Mediterranean member states
such as France, Spain and Italy, which will succeed each other in the
rotating presidency of the EU from January. These are the countries most
exposed to migratory pressure, but they are also the countries that most
fear that expansion to the north and east will shift the Union's political
centre of gravity and exacerbate its north-south divide.
'It's important to get something settled now,' argues Mr Manuel Marin, the
EU commissioner behind the Euro-Med initiative, 'otherwise it will be used
as a hostage to block negotiations on enlargement to the east.'
The Union wants putative Euro-Med associates to see an irresistible offer to
modernise and achieve rapid economic take-off leading to sustained growth.
Aid, leaving aside soft loans, would rise to a total of Ecu5.5bn in 1995-99
under the Commission plan, near par with planned outlays for eastern Europe
over the same period of Ecu7bn. Last year, all non-EU Mediterranean
countries got Ecu407m, against Ecu1.04bn for eastern Europe.
In the short term, the Union would quickly conclude 'association agreements'
already under negotiation with Israel, Morocco and Tunisia, analogous to
existing treaties with the east Europeans on everything except eventual EU
membership.
The Commission hopes this will have an exemplary effect, encouraging
Euro-Med nations to deregulate and liberalise their economies as the
Moroccans and Tunisians have done. Domestic reform and greater market access
to the EU helped lift the share of manufactured products in Moroccan exports
to the Union from 24 to 66 per cent between 1979 and 1993, and from 40 to 77
per cent in Tunisia's case, one Brussels study points out.
But the study also reveals that liberalisation has benefited EU exporters
far more than it has benefited Maghreb and Mashraq exporters - something
that Spain, Portugal and the eastern Europeans already know to be a
by-product of drawing close to the Euro-club.
For this reason, the future members of Euro-Med are likely to want to see
not only the colour of Brussels's money, but real commitment to market
access in sensitive areas such as textiles and agriculture, before they
commit themselves to such a scheme.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Debt crunch round the corner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW SHOULER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I hope your readership took the trouble to read Mr Jonathan Ruffer's
article on bond yields in an historical perspective (Personal View, October
25). Otherwise we may have to wait still further until there is a collective
awakening to the peculiarly nasty debt crunch sitting round the corner.
That the 'real yields now on offer may . . . prove completely unsustainable
to service' is not only a pointer towards a tendency to default, but is a
reason to anticipate a vicious circle leading in that direction, as markets
retreat accordingly and real rates rise further.
Moreover, the fear that will produce a self-fulfilling prophecy may do so
also on the further count of inflation, as governments ultimately choose to
reflate out of the deepening hole. The vicious circle may thereby be given
both momentum and durability.
It would be as comical as it is predictable if it were not deadly serious.
Clearly, the dilemma is by no means confined to Canada, spotlighted by your
editorial on the same day. America could be blamed for not hiking short
rates fast enough to protect long rates, but perhaps it can smell the
problem on its way.
No, the most farcical nonsense is that perpetrated for the past five years
in Europe, where the collective public debt/gross domestic product has
reached a staggeringly high 72 per cent. On the manic and indefensible
pretext of trying to convert Europe into a single state, a needless degree
of slump was imposed with mindlessly protracted monetary tightness, and the
error compounded with fiscal indulgence. (When will the UK authorities admit
out loud that the European dream is the most naked of emperors? This idiocy
is something to rebuff outright, not slide towards sullenly.)
This is a self-imposed nightmare. We have been paying a heavy price, and we
will keep paying it until we rid ourselves of the statist, social democratic
vanities of the political elite. Since they cannot see beyond the end of
their noses, truly, we ain't seen nothing yet. Andrew Shouler,

FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good start on cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir NICHOLAS FAIRBAIRN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have received two parliamentary answers, which might interest the
taxpayer.
The first is that Pounds 7m per annum is currently spent on sports
facilities for civil servants, mostly in London.
The second is that the special unit at Barlinnie Prison, which is intended
to redeem recidivist criminal psychopaths was opened on February 5 1973. To
date, 36 prisoners have been located there for varying periods of time.
The staffing costs alone run at about Pounds 300,000 per annum, or Pounds 6m
since its opening, which works out at Pounds 300,000 per prisoner - with
almost nothing to show for it. Could they bring the costs of their little
school a bit closer to the Pounds 5,000 a year at Eton, or half that for a
state pupil.
There, chancellor, is your chance to cut taxes and cut out waste.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Loss of prudence: Canada's big government debt burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time when one of the world's safest investments was a bond
issued by the government of Canada. With a stable political system, a solid,
sophisticated economy and a reputation for prudence, Canada was among a
handful of sovereign borrowers that could boast a triple-A credit rating.
Canadian bonds are no longer such a safe bet. Together with Sweden and
Italy, Canada is now at the top of the list of industrial countries where
public-sector profligacy has reached dangerous proportions. 'We are in hock
up to our eyeballs,' finance minister Paul Martin bluntly told a
parliamentary committee in Ottawa last week.
The federal government's debt will reach CDollars 550bn (Pounds 250bn) early
next year, bringing the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, a common
measure of a country's ability to service its debt, to 74 per cent. More
than a third of Ottawa's revenues is now channelled into interest payments,
up from 11 per cent in 1974.
But this is by no means the full extent of the problem. The 10 provinces and
public utilities, such as Ontario Hydro and Hydro-Quebec, are also heavy
borrowers. Ontario, for example, is among the most active non-sovereign
borrowers in the euromarkets. At the end of the current fiscal year, the
provinces will have a combined debt burden of more than CDollars 200bn, or
28 per cent of GDP.
'The sheer magnitude of Canada's foreign debt in relation to the size of the
economy means that Canada has be-come excessively vulnerable to the volatile
sentiments of global financial markets,' was the warning in a document
distributed by Mr Martin's department last week. 'We have suffered a
tangible loss of economic sovereignty.'
Such warnings do not appear misplaced. The proportion of Canada's total debt
held outside the country is now equivalent to 44 per cent of GDP, with more
than a quarter of the federal government's debt in foreign hands. According
to one senior Toronto banker, it would not take much, in such a finely
balanced situation, to engulf Canada in a full-blown financial crisis.
Investor confidence appears to be holding up, but it is fragile. The gap
between Canadian and US bond yields has recently narrowed, with the 10-year
spread down to 1.27 percentage points from more than 1.6 points in July.
This would normally indicate favourable investor sentiment. However, with
inflation virtually non-existent in Canada, real returns are extraordinarily
high. The real return on Canadian bonds is more than 9 per cent, against
about 5.3 per cent on comparable US treasury bonds.
Some warning shots have been fired across Canada's bows. The triple-A rating
has gone. Moody's, the US credit-rating agency, has downgraded half of
Canada's 10 provinces over the past three years, and upgraded none. The
agency has also warned that 'high public-sector deficits and uncertainties
regarding the new Quebec government's sovereignty goals could further
agitate the debt markets'.
High deficits are certainly agitating Canadian business leaders, who charge
that they constitute the most serious drag on the country's long-term
economic prospects.
The Business Council on National Issues, which represents 150 chief
executives, recently noted that the 'fiscal crisis' had given Canada 'real
interest rates that are among the highest in the industrialised world, a
devalued currency, an alarming amount of foreign indebtedness, declining
confidence among Canadian and foreign investors in the management of
Canada's public finances, the export of capital, and the expectation that
taxes will rise even higher to deal with bloated deficits.'
Canadian politicians' record on fiscal policy is dismal. The former
Progressive Conservative government, which held office in 1984-93, missed
almost every deficit-reduction target, and the budget shortfall in its final
year in office was a record CDollars 42bn.
Making matters worse, Ottawa has little control over the provinces' fiscal
policies or borrowing activities. Yet transfers to the provinces, to help
fund health, welfare and education, consume about 23 per cent of federal
spending, excluding debt-service. The federal government and most of the
provinces have so far avoided spending cuts in social programmes, although
these account for almost 60 per cent of federal spending.
Weary of carrying one of the world's heaviest tax burdens, Canadians appear
willing for the first time in decades to accept public service cutbacks. The
Conservative government in Alberta is one of the most popular in the
country, despite closing schools and hospital beds, and privatising many
public services. Thanks partly to rising oil revenues, Alberta is on track
to achieve a balanced budget in fiscal 1996-97.
Mr Martin has now put his Liberal government's credibility on the line by
promising to chop the federal deficit from CDollars 42bn or 5.4 per cent of
GDP last year to about CDollars 25bn or 3 per cent in 1996-97. 'It is a
target we will meet, come hell or high water,' he said last week.
He plans to outline specific deficit-cutting measures in next February's
budget.
He will be helped by accelerating business activity, which has begun to
boost tax revenues. While federal and provincial deficits were fuelled by
overspending during the 1980s, stagnant revenues have since been the main
reason for the failure to achieve deficit-reduction goals.
However, there will also have to be cuts in social programmes. Mr Lloyd
Axworthy, minister responsible for overhauling the social-security net, has
yet to convince the business community that he is willing, or able, to make
substantial savings.
Fearful of a political backlash, Mr Axworthy published a paper earlier this
month which raised numerous options, but contained no firm proposals.
He aims to introduce legislation next spring. But the timetable could slip
as special interest groups and the provinces resist change. And Mr Axworthy
has avoided the thorny issue of pensions, which the previous Conservative
government tried, but failed, to tackle almost a decade ago.
In February's budget, therefore, Mr Martin is likely to fall back on tax
increases and the closure of tax loopholes to reach his target.
For financial markets, an austere 1995 budget would be no more than a start
in tackling Canada's debt problem. A CDollars 25bn deficit in 1996-97 would
stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio, but not reduce it significantly.
Mr Martin has given no timetable for achieving his long-term aim of a
balanced budget. In view of the broken promises of the past, he and his
provincial counterparts will need to build a track record before holders of
Canadian bonds can relax.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We applaud you for your editorial 'Canada's debt dilemma' (October 25),
which points out that Canada must run a primary budget surplus of 2.6 per
cent of gross domestic product before its debt can begin to stabilise.
Canada's federal and provincial debt totals 100 per cent of GDP and to keep
this from increasing, a budget surplus is now required, even assuming
economic growth of 4.5 per cent.
What most taxpayers here fail to understand is that very large spending cuts
are required now - not tax increases. In a free country, if taxes are
increased, there will be a flight of capital from Canada's high tax regime.
Canadians hope our prime minister and his cabinet have read and taken heed
of your fine editorial - and do not increase taxes.

Sir, Geoffrey Martin, head of the European Commission, London, has strongly
refuted press allegations that Britain's membership of the EU has cost
Pounds 235bn, and added that public debate needs to be based on accurate
information. A 'back of the envelope' calculation (the Common Agricultural
Policy, ERM, handing-over of fishing zones, business losses through
over-regulation, reduction of Commonwealth trade, Brussels' cut of taxes . .
.) suggests that Pounds 200bn may not be far wrong. Does anyone know where
accurate information can be found?

Sir, The media (including the FT) has been reporting gleefully on delays to
the Eurostar Channel tunnel trains ('Channel train delayed again', October
26).
For regular travellers between London and Brussels, occasional delays of 10
minutes, or even an hour, such as those experienced by Eurostar would be
acceptable compared with the discomfort and constant unpunctuality of
travelling by air. London Heathrow now has the added inconvenience of
buildings collapsing into access tunnels. I will be abandoning the airlines
for Eurostar once regular services commence on November 14.
I suppose that one should take some comfort from the fact that these
Eurostar delays have not affected real people - only journalists]

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TERRY ARTHUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Digby Jacks (Letters, October 27) resorts to Newspeak in his
anti-privatisation drive. He attributes pensions mis-selling to 'the
headlong rush to privatise everything, including occupational pension
schemes'.
If my memory serves, occupational pension schemes had already been
'privatised' for many a long year, and it was increasing regulation which
set personal pensions alight. In particular, the regulation of private
employment contracts, including the unilateral voiding of existing
contracts, made it possible for an employee to leave an occupational scheme
without leaving employment.
Sanctity of contract is a sine qua non of private enterprise, and regulation
is a close relative of (indeed it is a form of) nationalisation not
privatisation.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A picture of the UK being
increasingly marginalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr AMORY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Rogaly's column, 'A royal pipe-dream' (October 18), was excellent
in drawing attention to the decline, moral and otherwise, that Britain has
sadly allowed itself to succumb to. As an ex-pat for the last 7 1/2 years in
the US, I have witnessed the UK's increasing marginalisation with growing
anxiety.
While other European countries get widespread coverage in US print and
broadcast media with their trading, industrial and technological
achievements, Britain's coverage seems limited to the latest folly about the
royal family or the government. Meanwhile, UK companies, advertising to US
audiences, seem to perpetuate the stereotype of the British class system.
The full extent to which Britain has failed to get its message across about
the role it can play came home to me the other day. An American friend was
discussing renewed tensions in Kuwait and recalled the Gulf war. 'I think
the best troops, apart from the Americans and the Israelis, were the
Jordanians and the French,' he said. He was unaware of the SAS raids on the
Scuds (although John Major has since commented on them), or of the RAF
low-level strikes against the Iraqi airfields, or, indeed, of any British
participation.
The good things that Britain can do get overshadowed by a whole lot of
absolutely trite, irrelevant imagery that portrays the country as a museum
run by patronising dodderers for the benefit of a few capricious duchesses.
I have noticed, with reference to your comments on the millennium
commission, that many Americans are unsure that Britain truly knows which
century is about to close around its ears. Something must be done - unless
Britain is to return to its pre-industrial status of an insignificant island
somewhere off the north-west coast of Europe.

John Major had to go and mess it up. One minute he was the new John Major,
confident, in command, of well-modulated voice and upright mien; the next he
was the familiar old John Major, improvising in a crisis, fumbling,
blustering, cornered, on the run. The new PM, on display in Belfast last
week, glowed with that special authority that comes from experience,
survival, and, over Ulster, possible success. He looked as if he might well
vanquish Mr Tony Blair, the young man who has come from nowhere to lead the
Labour party. The old PM, back in the House of Commons this week, dangled
and danced on the political stage, once again the puppet of events.
It is enough to bring tears to your eyes. It is not Mr Major's fault that by
the time he became prime minister four years ago his party had already won
too many elections in a row for the country's good. As we have seen in Japan
and Italy, parties that govern for too long turn corrupt. The cases are
different: the known and alleged instances of greedy or careless acceptance
of favours or cash by British elected officials are, by comparison with what
has been reported in Italy, Japan, France and elsewhere, picayune affairs in
which reputations have been lost, and offices forfeited, for the smallest of
small change. Nor is it certain that every would-be purchaser of British
government influence has received value for money.
For honourable as some of them affect to be, not all Britain's Conservatives
accord proper respect to the principles of baksheesh. The word, derived from
the Persian 'to give', implies a return of something to the giver. Some of
our cheapskates take the bribe, but fail to deliver the goods. That appears
to be the essence of Mr Mohamed Fayed's highly publicised series of
complaints against various Tory MPs and ministers. If so, the Egyptian-born
financier is not wholly correct. There is prima facie evidence to suggest
that other large-scale contributors to Conservative funds have received
whatever dividends the discreet use of patronage or influence can provide.
The chairman of Harrods ought to have appreciated that you can always trust
the word of a Tory gentleman, if you have a receipt.
This is not to aver that an absence of probity is a Conservative monopoly.
It was the Liberals under Lloyd George who introduced modern marketing
methods to the sale of peerages and honours. Past Labour governments have
harboured villains of one sort or another. Certain Labour local councils are
notoriously rotten. If the next government to be elected in Britain is a
Labour one, and if it remains in office for two or more terms, then as sure
as Lord Acton walked this earth, the continuous exercise of power will turn
the heads of some of even the saintly Mr Tony Blair's blessed colleagues.
That said, it is the Conservatives who have been running the government
since 1979. The ministers, MPs and party associates who have fallen from
office, or come under suspicion, or squirmed under the pointing fingers of
their accusers are all, to a man, Tories. What the prime minister terms
'public disquiet about standards of public life', is not that; it is public
disquiet about standards of Conservative life. The Tories are perceived to
be the source of connections, influence, trading in favours, the worship of
money - the living embodiment of the excesses of the 1980s. In the report of
Labour's Commission on Social Justice, published on Monday, there is a
reference to a phrase used by an American economist, Robert Kuttner, to wit
'every business relationship is a one night stand'.
So, it would appear, are many contemporary Tory political-business
relationships. Everyone can see that. The accumulation of news about quick
one-night stands, be they at the Ritz in Paris or in a Commons bar, has
severely damaged the government. Nobody trusts the Tories any more. Last
Friday it was argued here, as elsewhere, that if Mr Major is to regain the
confidence of the electorate in the good faith of his government he must
make it his overriding purpose to do so. He must understand the depth of
mistrust, and respond accordingly. In this he has failed.
He has in fact done the minimum possible, and that as camouflage. An
all-party committee that will sit under Lord Nolan will draw up rules for
the future behaviour of holders of public office, but it will not
investigate existing charges; nor will it ever inquire into what individuals
may have done. Some files have been assessed by Sir Robin Butler, the
secretary to the cabinet. Sir Robin has many excellent qualities, but he is
not an inquisitor, and he does his business in private. Hearings will be
held by the parliamentary committee of privileges, but Labour, rightly,
insists that it should sit in public. Mr Major says this would be against
precedent; so is the establishment of the Nolan committee. He says open
inquiries would be contrary to natural justice; as Mr Blair said yesterday,
courts operate in public. Justice must be seen to be done.
In any case, Mr Major's concern for natural justice is limited by political
expediency. He has retained two ministers against whom various allegations
were deemed by Sir Robin to be 'unsubstantiated' but dismissed one, Mr Neil
Hamilton. I hold no brief for Mr Hamilton, but Mr Major's treatment of him
is, to put it politely, inconsistent. Yesterday a new report appeared, in
which Mr Jonathan Aitken was accused by The Guardian newspaper of lying to
Sir Robin about a hotel bill. Mr Aitken has denied this, and Sir Robin has
backed him up.
The denials of such people, it is intimated, must be taken on trust. Very
well. But are we to take on trust the findings of the Nolan committee if it
is not to investigate the finances of political parties? Mr Major has
resisted this; another dodge. Mr Blair, whose sweetly reasonable approach is
not always a match for the prime minister's street-fighting, should not let
this one go. Dubious money flows to parties, and notably the Conservative
party, as well as to individual politicians. If Lord Nolan is as sharp now
as he was on the bench he will interpret his terms of reference to include
the consequences of political donations from suspect sources. Fate continues
to play cat-and-mouse with Mr Major.

There are 39 movies listed on satellite and cable networks today, starting
with The Vengeance Of She on the Movie Channel at 6.00 this morning, and
ending with Apache War Smoke on TNT at 3.25 tomorrow morning. But as
Britain's terrestrial channels still attract more than 93 per cent of
viewing, it seems to make more sense to look at their movie offers. Family
Business is a censored version of a 1989 yarn about three generations of a
New York meat trading firm. A typical Sidney Lumet film: proficient and
concerned with 'Issues' but never engrossing (BBC1 9.30). Body Parts is one
of those modern horror movies about grafted limbs in which the gore quantity
is high (11.20 BBC1). The Living End is a violent road movie about two
California homosexuals, who go on the run after one shoots a policeman
(11.45 C4). The best films are screened latest. Ballad Of A Soldier is
Chukhrai's famous Russian story (1959) about a young conscript who wins a
brief home leave (12.10 BBC2). Monkey Business is the 1931 movie in which
the Marx Brothers stow away on a ship; one of their best (1.20 C4).

FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Hopkins reigns over impressive Chekhov - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When you see Anthony Hopkins on stage, you realise that he has a force of
temperament (also of physique and voice) that is rare in our theatre; and
that this is coupled to a generally surprisingly low level of energy. The
effect makes him seem, much of the time, like a dormant volcano. He does not
come on and electrify or galvanise; what fires he reveals have already been
long smouldering within.
He is currently appearing at Theatr Clwyd as a Welsh Uncle Vanya, or Uncle
Ieuan (pronounced Yuyan, rhyming with Guy-an) in August, Julian Mitchell's
new adaptation of Chekhov's classic; and, though he has assembled an
ex-cellent troupe of co-actors with him, it is easy for him to dominate.
This is not to say Hopkins out-acts the others. Everything he does has
weight and interest; and you can only admire the way he has kept finding new
roles to extend himself.
His Ieuan is a shambolic, tottering study in despair, a generous mind
caustically embittered by unrequited love and unacknowledged toil, a sturdy
type crumbling as he perceives the end of all his hopes. He is always
impressive; entertaining, too; and he can make himself by turns absurd,
pathetic, infuriating. The way his voice combines leonine power and
dolcissimo tenderness is riveting, and the wavering off-balance deportment
he gives to Ieuan acutely sums up the character. He is not, however,
invariably persuasive. The big tirade explosion of Act III is too
blustering, the shambling antics sometimes overdone, and he too frequently
interrupts or undercuts other actors.
This version of Uncle Vanya - Hopkins' first venture as a director - is
connected to one of several (]) Vanya films at present - for example, Louis
Malle's Vanya on 42nd Street. Hopkins has already directed August for
Granada Film, using several of his current cast, filming it near Theatr
Clwyd. Maybe he will seem even more the star of the movie version.
On stage, however, I wish he had cast himself against, in particular, a
stronger Astrov (or, here, Dr Lloyd). Gawn Grainger, who plays this role, is
an excellent actor in the wrong part: he has more elegant detachment and
ironic languor than this virile role needs.
But Hopkins knows that this is an ensemble play. He certainly gives Grainger
full scope to brand Lloyd on our minds, and he has produced sharp character
studies all round. His way with Chekhov is basically in the Stanislavky
tradition: full of realistic detail, and a succession of evocative off-stage
sounds (birdsongs, church bells, piano music).
With the help of handsome designs by Eileen Diss (sets) and Dany Everett
(costumes), he and his adaptor, Mitchell, have placed the action on a large
Welsh estate during the 1890s - to take away bogus Russian mystique.
There are still times when Chekhov's thought remains unalterably Russian,
but mainly the effect is adroit. Especially in the very English moans of
Professor Brathwaite (Serebryakov) against Wales ('Wales] It's like living
in exile . . . I feel as if I've fallen off the earth on to some
undiscovered planet.' 'Wales,' here, is what, in Chekhov, is simply 'the
country'; the Professor will retire to Chelten-ham.
As the urbane, testy, selfish professor, Leslie Philips gives one of the two
sharpest characterisations. The other comes from Hugh Lloyd as a downtrodden
mouth-agape, shuffler. And no one gives a poor performance - however, vocal
projection in general is not strong enough, and several soliloquies were
slightly dull.
Lisa Orgolin is Helen/Yelena, utterly convincing as an American beauty (even
if I am not convinced that any American beauty in 1890s Britain would regard
herself as 'always a minor character'); and Rhian Morgan is touching as
Sian/Sonya.
Everyone reacts to one another with such accord that the stage world
acquires the strange multi-dimensional realism of the best Chekhov. At the
end, while Sian speaks of present work and future peace, Ieuan - seated
beside her - crumbles before our eyes, Prosser plays his mouth organ, and
the two old women - Gwen/Marina (Menna Trussler) and Mair/Marya (Rhoda
Lewis) - sit motionless on either side,in the evening still-ness, like a
pair of Whistler's mothers.
At the Theatr Clwyd, Mold.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Bastille a witness to dancers' pride - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Palais Garnier is closed for refurbishment, and the Paris Opera Ballet
has moved for this season to the Bastille Opera. I think the Bastille a
wonderful house: habitues complain about the constant need to go up and down
stairs, but it is an airy, grand and welcoming place in which to see the
lyric arts, and magnificently planned for its public.
To mark the start of the ballet season in its new home, the first programme
 -Balanchine and Robbins choreographies - begins with a Grand Defile.
Impossible to reproduce that sense of infinity we know with a defile at the
Palais Garnier as the cohorts of school and company process from the
chandeliered and mirrored depths of the Foyer de la Danse - the line may not
stretch to the crack of doom, but it goes back, symbolically speaking,
to the age of Louis XIV, founder of this temple.
But Francoise Seguin has devised a setting which cleverly echoes the
Bastille's architecture to provide a comparable idea of a long tradition. A
curved perspective leads down a ramp on to the stage. There we first see a
petit rat, who takes a simple pose and leads on the girls from the school as
the march from Les Troyens rings out. There follow the female ranks of the
company, each led by an etoile, then the boys of the school, and the men of
the troupe, each grade led by a star.
Masses of applause, and splendidly stellar behaviour from the etoiles as
they reach the front of the stage at slightly hastened pace to greet their
adoring public with smiles and glances imperious or beguiling. It is
irresistible as spectacle, and how revealing about the pride of the dancers
and of the French public - and the French public purse - in the Opera as a
spiffing example of a nation's art. Would we could feel the same about our
national ballet, its funding and its popular image.
The parade over, we had the joys of two Balanchine works - Le Palais de
Cristal and Four Temperaments - and Jerome Robbins' Glass Pieces. Le Palais
de Cristal is the Opera's very own Balanchine, made in 1947 when the
choreographer was resident in Paris. It is known elsewhere as the white and
sparkling Bizet Symphony in C. But at its creation in Paris it had a highly
coloured and complex design by Leonor Fini, and was danced in a manner more
 -shall we say? - temperamental than we know nowadays with New York City
Ballet. (Its
original cast included
Tamara Toumanova in the adagio, Lycette Darsonval, Micheline Bardin,
Madeleine Lafon - each a vivid personality.)
Their example, the Fini costumes and the original Balanchine text, linger
on. At Tuesday night's opening of the season, Monique Loudieres gave a most
beguiling account of the second movement adagio, deploying the complete
ballerina battery of technique, personality and a femininity that coloured
every movement. It was an irresistible and enchanting performance, the
epitome of a particular charm and grace of manner. The piece looked very
good in this Parisian version. The succeeding Four Temperaments was no less
fine on the absolute and uncompromising terms of New York's Balanchine.
As if to prove her versatility, Mlle Loudieres danced the 'Sanguine' duet
with ideal clarity, well partnered by Jean-Yves Lormeau. Kader Belarbi as
Melancholic, Patrick Dupond as Phlegmatic, Carole Arbo as Choleric, caught
the style well. After nearly half a century, Four Temperaments still looked
inevitable and prophetic in this performance.
Robbins' Glass Pieces, which closed the bill, might have been made for the
Bastille stage. The graph-paper setting matches the house's architecture.
The mechanical crossing and re-crossing of the stage that start the piece
are matched by the crowds on the Place de la Bastille or in the Metro. It is
an oddly heartless and urgent work, and Robbins gives the driving
repetitions of Philip Glass' music a human intensity.
It is a ballet I admire rather than like, but the Opera cast are superb,
robot-like or - in the pas de deux well done by Marie-Claude Pietragalla and
Jean-Marie Didiere - hieratically moving. Vaut le voyage.
The Paris Opera Ballet repeats the programme on October 31, November 1,4,6
matinee, 8,10,12,15,18, at the Bastille.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Rambling through history - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Edgar's new play could be a thriller about art and the work of art
historians. It could be about the plight of asylum-seekers in south-eastern
Europe. It might be comedy, satire or melodrama. In fact, Edgar has flung in
a bit of everything.
Pentecost is at times literally a babble of voices, Christian, Moslem,
Jewish, agnostic - a collection of people who have been displaced by the end
of communism in Europe and the hostilities in the former Yugoslavia. Yet the
play does not start like that.
The set, designed by Robert Jones, is an abandoned church near the border of
an unnamed country in the Balkans. The mural behind what must have been the
altar is a slice of socialist realism. It is what lies underneath that
matters. Could it have been Giotto or, even more tantalisingly, a work that
foreshadowed Giotto about a century beforehand?
A female local curator tries with increasing success to convince a visiting
British art expert that it is the latter, though he is careful to say that
his subject is contemporary, not pre-Renaissance. Still, it looks like one
of the biggest art discoveries of all time. Then an American arrives to
dispute the findings.
Meanwhile the local Catholic and Greek Orthodox priests are quarrelling
about repossession of the church. The minister for restoration in the new
regime is suspicious of all foreigners who might want to claim the painting.
All that would be enough for a play in itself, even one - like Pentecost -
lasting three hours. Just before the interval, however, there is an
interruption. In storms a group of refugees, taking hostages and demanding
safe passage to a country that will give them a home. The second half is
largely a vehicle for letting the refugees explain their various origins, as
well as the affinity that can develop between captives and captors. I shall
not say how it ends, though it is with a bang.
The common theme is that in this part of the world populations have shifted
throughout the centuries as invaders came and went. The end of the Soviet
empire is only one more change. Yet the price of all that shifting has been
the lack of a defined identity.
With the collapse of communism and Soviet rule, some of the characters would
like to join the 'European Club', but are not sure what the club is, nor
whether Europe will have them.
In its present form, Pentecost is a slightly rambling piece. Nevertheless,
Edgar writes well, as usual, has some fun with the linguistics and has
clearly done his research on art history as well as the Balkans. He is good,
without being obscure, at having characters discuss ideas on stage.
Sometimes, too, he comes up with a surprise. The most striking character in
Pentecost is the American art academic who enters like a freelance
photographer looking for a war, but turns out to have considerable expertise
 -and humanity. This is an excellent performance by Linal Haft.
I liked Jan Ravens with her funny English as the local curator. On the other
hand, Charles Kay as the British art expert is a little too much stock
Englishman. Direction is by Michael Attenborough; the piece should be cut by
about 20 minutes before it comes to London.
The Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. Pentecost is financially supported by
JBA.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Arts: Clarity and intensity - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No sooner had pianist Mitsuko Uchida begun her South Bank series of solos
juxtaposing Schubert's and Schoenberg's music, than pianist Andras Schiff
and friends launched their little Intimate Letters festival (underwritten by
Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld) at the Barbican Centre in which Schubert was paired
with a composer who seems no more likely a bedfellow, Leos Janacek.
They were born within a few hundred Austro-Hungarian miles of each other,
Schubert in 1797 and Janacek in 1854, but the gentle Landler influence on
the first and wilder Bohemian influence on the second are not very
comparable, just as Janacek's compressed, elliptical, nuggety way of writing
contrasts starkly with Schubert's serene lyrical expansiveness.
Schiff, who tried out the idea at his 1991 chamber music festival in Mondsee
(near Salzburg), believes, however, that the two 'strong individual' voices
'work beautifully together' and he is probably, though indefineably, right.
The concert he gave in Barbican Hall with violinist Yuuko Shiokawa and
cellist Miklos Perenyi interwove Janacek's Pohadka ('Fairy Tale') of 1910
for cello and piano, Schubert's melodious Notturno, D897, for piano trio,
Janacek's violin sonata (1922) and Schubert's E flat piano trio, and was
deeply satisfying. That is almost an understatement: their account of the
great Schubert trio with its vastly sustained finale was a miracle of
ensemble intelligence, a ladder leading straight to musical heaven. The
stray slow movement of D897 was no less of a joy: here, as in the
large-scale work, Schiff perfectly caught that sublime diaphanous quality so
notable in Schubert's writing for piano-with-ensemble. But he showed an
equal sensitivity to the far other idiom - taut, nervous, abrupt, turbulent
 -of Janacek's piano writing: his flurries of notes had a wonderfully
decisive clarity and both his duet partners played with searching intensity.
Schiff took a modest part in the concert given earlier the same evening by
James Wood's admirable New London Chamber Choir and the Guildhall Chamber
Ensemble over the water at St Giles, Cripplegate. We heard Janacek's three
works for female chorus, all composed in 1916 when men had better - or worse
 -things to do than sing.
They proved intriguingly diverse in texture, the grim narrative of The
Wolf's Trail calling not just for the piano obbligato which Schiff supplied
but for a tenor who intermittently shrieks; the gently patriotic Songs of
Hradcany subtly coloured by flute and harp; the pacey ballad of Kaspar Rucky
stirring up a sonorous devil's brew. The best item was the sequence of 19
pithy nursery rhymes, Rikadla (1926), for small mixed chorus and a bright
ensemble including ocarina and child's drum. If the earlier choruses were
unusual, this was oddity running riot, and the result a masterpiece.
Schubert is rarely if ever odd. Two of his piano-accompanied, female-voice
part-songs opened the final concert of the mini-festival last Wednesday at
Barbican Hall. Wood's New London ladies with Schiff's exquisitely weighed
accompaniments found the full measure of limpid classical beauty in Psalm
No. 23 (D706), Gott in der Natur (D757) and, with soloist Sarah Walker, in
Standchen (D920), which was at once repeated.
That relaxed gesture only confirmed the resemblance of this programme -
greatly altered by the indisposition of Ann Murray and Philip Langridge, who
should have been giving Janacek's Diary of One Who Disappeared - to a
Schubertiad.
Schiff offered pellucid performances of two Schubert sonatas, and if he
missed the massy raptness of the G major (D894) - the molto moderato first
movement being taken almost trippingly - he brought to the A minor (D784) a
most moving simplicity and restraint.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): A quicker lease of life for
batteries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A common complaint from users of equipment such as laptop computers is the
time it takes to recharge batteries. Most chargers take several hours, while
those that work more rapidly usually shorten the batteries' life.
DSB Special Batteries, a Sussex-based company formerly owned by Duracell
Batteries, has introduced technology which cuts the charging time for nickel
cadmium or nickel metal hydride battery packs to less than 30 minutes, while
extending the battery life by around 50 per cent.
The DSB system uses a charge control chip, developed by Integrated Circuit
Systems of the US, which avoids shortening the life of the battery by
stopping the process before it is fully charged. It speeds up the charging
process by including a discharge pulse in every charge cycle which prevents
crystalline deposits from forming. The discharge pulse also overcomes the
'memory' effect, whereby batteries that are not fully discharged before
recharging lose their capacity to become fully charged.

Renault, Europe's second largest diesel engine manufacturer, is developing a
filtering system to cut emissions from diesel engines in conjunction with
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company.
The programme will build on work by Rhone-Poulenc, which has developed a
catalyst derived from cerium. When this is added to the fuel, it lowers the
combustion temperature of carbon particles to about 200'C, allowing the
particles to be burned off. Diesel engine emissions of nitrogen dioxide and
carbon particles are highly pollutive.

The risk of developing heart disease can be lowered by eating eggs from hens
fed on a special diet, according to Australian scientists.
The 'HeartSmart' egg tastes like an ordinary egg but is rich in Omega 3, a
group of fatty acids believed to help cut heart disease. It does not,
however, cut the level of cholesterol in the egg, which many scientists
believe is implicated in heart disease. The eggs are being marketed in
Australia by University Partnerships.
The Omega 3 fatty acids, which are found mainly in fish, are thought to be
important in the development of babies, according to David Farrell of the
University of Queensland, who conducted the study. He found that
breast-feeding mothers could raise the Omega 3 content of their milk by
eating the HeartSmart eggs.

The University of East Anglia is building a lecture theatre and office
block, which is designed to consume a fifth of the energy used by a
conventional building.
The 3,000 sq metre building is expected to have the lowest energy
consumption of any comparable building in the UK, when it opens next
January, according to Fulcrum Engineering which designed it with John Miller
&amp; Partners, architects. It is expected to use fewer than 50kW hours per
square metre per year.
The building, which relies on a high standard of insulation, is designed to
require no heating in winter, except for unusually cold periods. It will be
cooled by using the exposed mass of the structure to absorb heat during the
day, while at night the floors will be cooled by circulating air through the
floor slabs.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology: Japan's flight of fantasy - Building an airport
on a man-made island presented special engineering challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Kansai International Airport opened on a man-made island in the middle
of Osaka Bay in central Japan, it was greeted by the typical chorus of
disapproval that attends most large civil engineering projects: it was too
expensive, it was sinking, it was not large enough, it was a white elephant.
It cost more than Y1,500bn (Pounds 9.5bn) to build, 50 per cent more than
projected when work began 10 years ago. Since the first aircraft touched
down on September 4, just 110 arrivals and departures take place a week,
compared with the planned-for 454.
But if there is a success story, it is to be found in the architectural and
technological achievements of the ambitious project. Nearly 2km long and
occupying more than 300,000sq m, it is the world's biggest airport terminal.
It sits, wings outstretched like a great gull, on a 520ha artificial island,
5km offshore, joined to the mainland by a double-deck road and rail
causeway.
A project of that size brought unique challenges to its engineers, a
British-Japanese collaboration of Ove Arup and Nikken Sekkei.
The principal difficulty arose from that scale. The number of flights the
airport would be required to handle meant it would be Japan's first 24-hour
facility. But the Kansai region is a flat, densely populated plain, flanked
by mountains to the north and sea to the south.
A 24-hour airport on such crowded land would require the kind of tolerance
of late-night flights for which the Japanese are not renowned. It was
decided instead to build an island in Osaka Bay and put the airport there.
In normal circumstances that would have presented few unfamiliar problems.
Landfill reclamation is a local speciality in Osaka Bay - there were already
half a dozen sites in the bay reclaimed for port facilities when the project
started. The initial plans involved building the airport 1km out to sea,
like most of the other artificial islands in the area.
But the Osaka Bay's fishing community, which was courted assiduously for
permission to build the airport, objected to the idea of a site so close to
land within their waters. After a prolonged wrangle, it was agreed to build
the island 5km from the shore.
That decision created the principal difficulties for the construction of the
island and the terminal building. As John Batchelor, in charge of Ove Arup's
Japanese operations, puts it: 'The difference between placing something 1km
and 5km from land was enormous. Five kilometres into the bay the water is
much deeper and the soil much softer. The volume of landfill on such soil
meant the island would settle considerably over a period of a few years.'
To minimise the effect of settlement, the subsoils immediately below the
seabed bottom, composed of soft alluvial clay, had to be strengthened. This
involved draining the clay layer by injecting sand, increasing the density
of the soil and hardening it. In total 1m sand drains were installed in the
clay, four times as many as have been used in the past 25 years in Japanese
offshore construction.
The site was then completed with landfill reclamation. The water depth at
the chosen site required soil reclamation of about 33m in depth - a total of
180m cu ft of fill - some 50 per cent more than had ever been used in the
construction of similar islands in Japan. Yet the whole process -
improvement of the foundations and full reclamation - was completed in less
than five years.
But although the strengthening of the foundations had gone a considerable
way towards limiting the settlement, it had not been eliminated completely.
This posed a new problem for the construction of the terminal building
itself. The engineers' calculation was that, following the improvement, the
total settlement would be more than 2m, but would be at an exponential rate,
with rapid sinking at the outset, gradually diminishing towards zero in the
future.
If the settlement occurred to the same degree all over the building, there
would be little structural problem, but the danger was that different parts
of the building would sink at different speeds, threatening to break the
back of the structure.
Ove Arup and Nikken Sekkei opted for a technique that had been tried in
smaller buildings on reclaimed land, but not on the scale of a vast airport
terminal. They built a system of computer-controlled hydraulic jacks that
actually raise and lower the building's 900 columns. Pipes between the
pillars contain advanced spirit levels that measure precise movements of the
building.
Every two months the building's maintenance engineers wheel a vast computer
around the basement of the building and plug it into each pillar. The
computer provides a series of readings of the differential movement of each
of the pillars. They can then calculate precisely which pillars need to be
raised and which lowered. Deep in the foundations, the pillars are then
moved up or down by removing or inserting shims - metal wedges that sit
beneath them.
The more mundane consequences were also tackled. Over the next 10 years the
building is expected to settle by as much as 1m. The jacking system ensures
that only the ground level will actually move, while the rest of the
building remains intact, but the fact that the settlement is differential
means that one side of the building could fall, creating difficulties for
walls, doors and staircases.
As Batchelor explains: 'The roof and outer walls are fixed but the
hydraulics allow the floor to move around like water in a choppy sea. This
could create difficulties such as walls with gaps at the bottom as the
ground moves.'
So, at the ground level all the walls and staircases are longer than they
initially need to be. As the floor descends or rises with each jack movement
the walls slide out of panels and 'stretch'. The staircases contain an extra
two hidden steps to allow for this movement, and the plumbing systems are
all built with flexible pipes. The overall effect is that the passenger does
not notice that one side of the building could be 1m lower than the other.
While in the foundations modern applications of the primitive jack keep the
building secure, in the roof a new concept keeps it comfortable. A problem
that confronted Ove Arup in constructing the interior of the terminal was
that Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who designed the building, was
concerned that the structure should, from both inside and out, maintain the
pure simplicity of its curves, unimpeded by any obtrusions.
Unfortunately the demands of human comfort require most buildings to have
large air conditioning units in their ceiling, involving complex and usually
unprepossessing pipes and boxes which Piano was anxious to avoid.
Ove Arup's solution was the creation of what they call 'open air ducts'.
Seventeen vast blue nozzles pump air at high speed from the ground level of
the international departures floor to the ceiling. The air is then conducted
along Teflon-coated strips of fabric following the curve of the roof, the
shape of which had been determined by the profile that would carry air most
effectively across the space. The conducted air then falls, losing speed and
circulates back along the floor, producing a cool breeze at passenger level.
The design of the roof also helped facilitate the engineers' safety plans.
Japanese regulations require fire-resistant compartments of no more than
500cu m. The Kansai terminal forms a continuous volume of more than 1m cu m.
Ove Arup convinced the regulators the high curved roof would allow smoke to
rise and stay trapped in the ceiling area for long enough to allow
passengers to escape the building.
According to Batchelor, the conjunction of form and content is what makes
the building unique in Japan. 'Buildings form an essentially practical
purpose in Japan,' he says. 'They are simple, they work and they are boring.
This is a building that departs from that tradition. It is a work of grace
and style that uses technology to perform its basic function.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: How old is your boardroom? - National age
differences among executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US tends to have the oldest company directors. Germany's are marginally
more geriatric than the French, while Britain vies with Sweden for the
youngest boardroom blood.
These are the main findings of a survey* by Accord Group, an international
executive search firm, aimed at identifying the age range of those running
top companies in five of the leading western economies.
'If there was a surprise it was that the differences are not actually that
great,' observes David Dumeresque, a partner in London-based Tyzack &amp;
Partners which carried out the UK part of the research and which is a
founder member of Accord.
'The idea was inspired by the fuss about Lord Weinstock's age over the
summer which made us curious as to whether he is old in relation to
directors of companies elsewhere.'
Accord looked at the 100 UK constituents of the FT-SE 100 Index, with the
top 50 scrutinised in France, Germany, Sweden and the US. Based on the most
recent returns or report and accounts individual directors were placed into
one of four categories: non-executives; senior executive directors (that is,
executive chairman, chief executive, managing director); finance director;
and 'other' (all other executive directors whatever their responsibility).
The conclusions by country were as follows:
UK. Senior executives tend to be in their 50s and early 60s with Lord Hanson
(72) the most aged and Archie Norman of Asda (40) the most precocious. UK
finance directors were among the youngest in the sample, with half being
under 50, the oldest 61, and the youngest (BTR's Kathleen O'Donovan) a mere
36.
Only about 10 per cent of UK executive directors remain in post after their
60th birthday, but the majority of non-executives are into their seventh
decade. The oldest non-exec is Lord Forte (84), the youngest is 40-year-old
Louise Patten (Ladbroke).
US. While the average age of boards is relatively high, executive directors
tend to resign earlier than in other countries. The majority of non-execs
are over 64, though the oldest (75-year-old John E Tate of WalMart) is a
stripling by international standards.
The majority of American senior executives are over 60, though the oldest (T
Marshall Hahn Jr of Georgia Pacific) is only 68, younger than in both France
and the UK. US finance directors are also somewhat older than their opposite
numbers in other countries with a mean age
of 60.
France. Most categories of directors are at about the mid-point on Accord's
international scale. Although the oldest non-exec in France is 85 (Gabriel
Mathey of Casino) the majority are in their 60s.
France has the distinction of the oldest senior executive - 76-year-old
Antoine Riboud of Danone. Germany. The country with the oldest non-exec (88)
and oldest executive director (an 87-year-old at Holzmann) in the survey.
Over half the non-execs were in excess of 64 and more than 25 per cent over
68.
Senior executives tend to be in their early 60s, but they also retire early
with only 10 per cent over 65. German finance directors were the oldest in
the survey after the Americans.
Sweden. Directors here are the youngest in every category, with half the
non-execs aged less than 56 and 75 per cent under 62. Ninety per cent of
senior executives are less than 59 with only a quarter more than 56. Fredrik
Sandelin of Ratos is the youngest finance director in the survey at 32.
As for lessons, Dumeresque is dubious. 'There is no right age,' he says.
'You can find someone completely past it and burnt out at 60, but there are
plenty of strong, vibrant 75-year-olds.'
On the other hand, he adds, 'it does help to be called Hanson' (a reference
to the survey finding that the family also boasts the youngest UK executive
director in 33-year-old Robert).

FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: Personnel values - Does the human resource
department have a future?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the late spaghetti western producer Sergio Leone had made a feature film
about personnel management - and the likelihood of that was about as remote
as the planet Pluto - he would probably have billed it The Job With No Name.
Its sheer fuzziness and lack of hard performance measures are a constant
source of frustration in management circles, as well as provoking suspicions
among employees and scepticism among academics. The Trades Union Congress,
for instance, recently wrestled with the meaning of human resource
management - as personnel is sometimes called - describing it as a 'slippery
concept' and questioning the motive behind some HRM practices.
The formation earlier this year of the Institute of Personnel and
Development - the professional body combining the old Institute of Personnel
Management and the Institute of Training and Development - came at a time
when some companies were dispensing with their personnel departments
completely, choosing to assign the responsibility to line managers. Indeed
at this week's annual conference of the IPD in Harrogate, which finishes
today, Sir Brian Pitman, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, told delegates
that removing the central personnel department at Lloyds was one of the most
effective changes the bank had made.
He said: 'Line managers now understand the pains of some of the decisions
that personnel has to take.'
However, in spite of this, there seems a sense among delegates that their
time has finally come.
Mike Bett, the IPD president, summed it up by pointing to a growing
recognition that the survival and success of organisations will increasingly
depend on their ability to build highly skilled workforces and to release
the full potential of employees. 'There should be a professional personnel
and development specialist on all top management teams: in the boardroom and
on the executive committees,' he suggested, adding that personnel should be
involved in developing front-line boardroom strategy.
Bett's confidence in a rosy future, however, is not universally shared.
Earlier in the year a team headed by David Metcalf at the London School of
Economics described personnel specialists as 'big hat, no cattle' with lots
of pretentions and few results. Its research suggested that the presence of
a personnel manager was associated with poorer employee relations.
Drawing from the same body of research as that used by the LSE team - the
third Workplace Industrial Relations Survey - but taking a different
definition of personnel, David Guest, of Birkbeck College in London, and Kim
Hoque, a researcher at the LSE, presented a more positive picture. Their
study concluded that HRM was producing superior performances in the
workplace. The contribution of personnel specialists, said Guest and Hoque,
had been difficult to identify because they often worked by exercising
influence in partnership with line managers. This sometimes created
ambiguity about personnel responsibilities so that when things went wrong it
proved expedient to blame the personnel specialist.
Personnel's influence on strategy is equally a subject of debate and
contradictory research. Guest and Hoque quote earlier research which
suggests that personnel departments often have insufficient responsibility
to influence human resource strategy. They noted another study, however, by
Cranfield School of Management and Price Waterhouse International, which
found that 43 per cent of personnel directors claim to be involved in the
formulation of corporate strategy from the outset.
The IPD's response to personnel's uncertain role has been to place a strong
emphasis on sifting good practice from bad in an effort to position itself
in Bett's words, as 'the pre-eminent professional body influencing and
improving the quality, thinking and practice of people management and
development'.
On the one hand the IPD is promising to extend training and support for
often hard-pressed personnel professionals, on the other it is wedging open
the door, making itself accessible as a consultancy service and provider of
books, reports, seminars and conferences.
Conscious of the jargon, Geoff Armstrong, the IPD's director general, has
also committed the institute to encouraging greater clarity of the personnel
role. 'By removing jargon and barriers to understanding, we must spread the
message that the development and management of people is much more than a
series of fashionable programmes,' he said shortly after the formation of
the institute. He believes personnel is 'a systematically learnable
discipline, with a wide range of explicit competencies which need to be
applied appropriately by everyone who has responsibility for other people'.
The IPD has warned against what Armstrong calls the promotion by gurus of
'the wonders of human resource management' at the expense of collectivism,
industrial relations and some personnel procedures. 'Performance management,
single status and individually tailored payment packages are presented as
the new snake oil which can achieve miracles anywhere', he says. 'Such dogma
is misleading and dangerous.
'Useful tools have been packaged up under the banner of human resource
management and sold as panaceas, to be applied at any time and place.
Without proper regard for the organisation's established culture and
particular needs, most such flavours of the month prove deeply
disappointing.'
The role of the personnel officer or manager, argues Armstrong, is to apply
new practices where they are helpful and where they can be adapted to the
specific needs of organisations. 'We have seen recently the immense problems
which arise when performance-related pay, decentralised bargaining and
commercial imperatives are imposed as though they, in isolation, can provide
all the answers in our schools and hospitals,' he said.
He is distancing the IPD from the concept that HRM should be used as an
exploitative tool of management. What lessons can be drawn from human
resource management? Will it be a distinct learnable discipline at the
cutting edge of organisational and employee development in the 21st century
or will it fade away, remembered only as a brave attempt to bag up an
elusive set of ideas? The challenge for personnel is to maintain its
separate identity in the shifting emphasis within rapidly changing
organisations. Leading that shift could ensure that it has a bright future.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Management: Linking up with schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers wanting to build links with education now have a growing body of
experience to tap for ideas.
Companies based in rural areas, in particular, can use a close link with a
school to improve the skills of children who will later form their main pool
of recruits, as well as to advertise themselves as good employers.
UCB Films, the Belgian-owned packaging manufacturer, has set up a link with
the local secondary school in Wigton, Cumbria, where it is the largest
employer with a workforce of 800. Its three aims are to improve the
attractiveness of careers with the company, to aid understanding of industry
among teachers and, unusually, to share resources and experience.
That means that the school's teachers provide foreign language tuition to
company personnel, and assist with outdoor activities intended to help with
management training and development for graduates, senior managers and
supervisors.
The services UCB provides to the school are tailored to run throughout the
curriculum. It provides work experience, with two weeks guaranteed for every
child in year 10 (14- and 15-year-olds. Staff also help with Young
Enterprise companies - offering children management experience - and with
the Young Engineer of Britain awards - which allowed pupils to help design a
vehicle warning device for use at UCB's site.
More imaginatively, it provides help with the history curriculum for
13-year-olds, with pupils visiting the site to help visualise the impact of
the Industrial Revolution, and with GCSE geography, where pupils are allowed
a perception of the production process, and of the importance of wealth
creation.
The link won this year's Gardner-Merchant/CBI Award for Excellence in
Education Business Partnership, and is now recommended as an example for
other companies to follow.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Property: Idea with big backers - The urban village is
gathering support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK government policy on urban development has come forward in leaps and
bounds over the past two years. The most vivid symbol of the new approach is
planning policy guidance note 6, issued by the Department of the Environment
in July 1993 and subsequently refined by ministerial speeches.
PPG6 marked a new interventionist approach after the market-led years of the
1980s. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has since tried to stimulate
debate about how the man-made environment can be improved.
The latest idea vying for the minister's attention is the urban village:
mixed-use, mixed-tenure developments where people could work as well as
live.
The urban village movement already has friends in high places. The idea was
first promoted by the Prince of Wales at the end of the 1980s. A seminar to
launch a report on the economics of urban villages was held this week at St
James's Palace. The campaign also has allies close to the seat of power. The
report was sponsored by English Partnerships, the government agency set up
to co-ordinate urban regeneration policy.
Many of the tenets behind urban villages seem to be in tune with government
thinking. Planning policy is already moving away from broad, single-use
areas towards a more diverse approach. Urban villages might also cut down on
traffic by allowing residents to work locally.
But turning the urban village blueprint into reality will require more than
warm words. The report makes two main policy recommendations:
the DoE should issue a planning policy guidance note encouraging local
authorities to designate specific sites for urban villages.
Once a site was designated, the hope is that land values would be low enough
to allow a private sector developer to provide all the extras of an urban
village - such as community facilities - and still make a return on
investment.
government funding should be made available where such intervention through
the planning system was not enough.
In cases where urban village sites had negative development value - because
they needed to be cleared or cleaned - up to 10 per cent of the total cost
might have to come from the public purse.
This second proposal is hardly controversial. Government funding for urban
development projects has traditionally been used to 'lever in' private
sector cash. Under the City Challenge programme Pounds 1 of public money
typically attracts about Pounds 4 of private sector funds.
Given the interest of English Partnerships in the urban villages campaign,
it would be the obvious source of funding. Such investment would be in line
with the agency's stated desire to use its Pounds 250m a year budget to take
equity stakes rather than simply disbursing grants. Last week, English
Partnerships announced an Pounds 8m investment in an urban village-style
project at Barking Reach, Essex, promoted by Bellway Homes. This investment
is expected to lever in private-sector funds totalling some Pounds 24m,
suggesting a funding ratio of about 1:3.
If changes in the planning regime allowed this ratio to be raised to 1:9, as
the report suggests, urban villages would become an efficient use of scarce
resources.
Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman of the Urban Villages Forum and former chairman
of Speyhawk, the developer which went into receivership last May, takes the
argument one stage further. 'Society has to decide whether it is getting
social value for money out of its current patterns of urban development,' he
said. 'Areas which display urban village characteristics show lower levels
of crime and deprivation.'
Mr Osborne envisages up to 20 urban villages under development by 2000, at
an average cost each of Pounds 10m. If government support was required for
each, that would imply Pounds 1.8bn of private sector investment and Pounds
200m of public sector support.
But using the planning system to promote a particular style of development
is more controversial. The free-market approach was argued this week by Mr
Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool University, at
a conference run by the National Federation of Housing Associations.
Although he did not say so, Mr Minford might have noted that the grand
estates of London's West End admired by the urban villages movement, such as
Marylebone, were built without planning intervention.
The message of PPG6, though, is that this laisser faire view is no longer
mainstream in government.
The wider danger is that the urban village movement becomes a Trojan horse,
in which volume housebuilders smuggle development into green-belt areas.
The report concedes that urban villages built on edge-of-town or green-field
sites would require little or no public sector financial support. Neither is
it clear how many 100-200 acre inner-city sites would be suitable for urban
village development.

FT  28 OCT 94 / People: Warburgs slims its structures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, smarting from a steep drop in profitability during the first
half of its trading year, has slimmed down its internal management
committees. Warburg insiders say that no fewer than nine internal memos have
been circulating informing staff of new reporting lines and committee
structures.
However, a spokesman says that planning for the changes had begun two months
before the profits warning and are 'completely unrelated to trading
conditions'.
Most significantly, the Investment Banking Management Committee has been
trimmed from 18 to eight. It now consists of Derek Higgs, chairman of SG
Warburg and Co, Nick Verey, chairman of SG Warburg Securities, Simon
Leathes, group finance director, Lord Cairns, chief executive and chairman,
and Piers Von Simson, head of European operations, Michael Gore, chairman of
Warburg Asia/Pacific, Tom Wyman, chairman of SG Warburg and Co in the US and
Rodney Ward, group director in the Hong Kong office.
Gone are Rod Steel, head of information technology, Michael Sargent, head of
equities, Peter Twachtmann, joint head of fixed interest, Penryn Pockney,
head of market-making, John Trueman, head of group risk, David Hobbley and
Mark Nicholls, who were joint heads of corporate finance, and Kent Haeger,
head of equity derivatives.
'The purpose is to sharpen the focus of responsibility and accountability of
individuals,' Warburg explains. 'Things were taking too long to be decided.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / People: David Snedden to chair Trinity International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has not taken long for Trinity International's double act to get back in
harness. David Snedden will take over the non-executive chairmanship of the
Chester-based newspaper group from Simon Mosley on December 1, renewing his
partnership with Philip Graf, the deputy who succeeded him as chief
executive after Snedden's retirement 19 months ago.
Snedden, 62, and Graf, 47, have been working together since the 1970s, when
Graf was Snedden's protege at Thomson Regional Newspapers. Snedden brought
Graf into Trinity two years after he moved to the Liverpool Daily Post &amp;
Echo - as Trinity then was - in 1982. This announcement is no surprise, as
Snedden stayed on the board as a non-executive after retiring and quickly
became deputy chairman.
Trinity - formerly a close company with one management share held by each of
12 directors - enfranchised its shareholders last year. This has encouraged
wider ownership, with new institutional buyers including the Prudential and
M&amp;G. Snedden, Graf and finance director Mike Masters  - the key people in
driving the change - now occupy the three top seats in the boardroom.
Snedden now splits his domicile between Edinburgh and a riverside flat in
Liverpool's Albert Dock complex. Since he also recently became chairman of
Norcor Holdings, the Norwich corrugated packaging company which floated this
year, he will certainly not be under-using his company car: the acquisitive
Trinity's 50-or-so newspaper titles are spread throughout Scotland,
north-west England, North Wales, West Yorkshire and the south-east.

FT  28 OCT 94 / People: Evans to take his own pension
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Evans, 59, one of Britain's most successful pension fund managers, is
stepping down as investment manager of the Pounds 1.2bn Courtaulds Pension
fund.
He hands over to his deputy, David Brief, 41, at the end of the year.
Evans, who once taught finance at London Business School, is not as well
known as his two predecessors, Alastair Ross Goobey, who runs PosTel and
Matthew Oakeshott, who set up Olim, a money management firm.
However, he has been around longer than both of them. He first managed
Courtaulds' pension money in the mid-1970s before joining Oliver Marriott -
author of The Property Boom - in the property business. He returned in 1986.
During his 28 years with Courtaulds, Evans has done several jobs, including
that of chief economist. However, he is best known for providing Courtaulds
pensioners with above average investment returns.
In an industry which worships the average, Courtaulds in-house pension fund
has always been the odd man out. It has prospered by not following the herd
and under Evans has outperformed its peer group by an average of 1 1/2 per
cent per annum. Part of Evans' skill has lain in his knowledge of the
property market.
Evans will be 60 next month when he reaches Courtaulds' normal retirement
age. However, he does not plan to quit the City completely. He is chairman
of one of Foreign and Colonial's smaller investment trusts and also chairs
Quintain, an unquoted property company which he hopes will come to the stock
market at some stage.
David Brief joined Courtaulds pension fund in 1991 from Citibank.

FT  28 OCT 94 / People: Paula Vennells puts on her running shoes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Marketing is a fast-moving business but some marketing directors move faster
than others. Pizza Hut (UK) put out a press release saying that Paula
Vennells, 35, would be joining as marketing director from Dixons, the
retailer, where she was retail marketing director.
Now it turns out that she is not joining Pizza Hut after all, but is instead
going to Sears Sports &amp; Leisurewear, where she is to be general manager for
Sportsworld, the group's out-of-town sports chain.
Pizza Hut this week said they were now looking for her replacement but
otherwise did not want to discuss the matter. 'We are surprised and
disappointed, but these things do happen,' said a Pizza Hut spokesman.
It seems that Vennells was tempted by the offer from Sears, which came along
later in the day on learning that she was scouting round for a move from
Dixons. Sears has contacted Pizza Hut and apart from normal competitive
disappointments, fences appear to have been mended.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Property: Further decline in all-property return rate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The all-property rate of total return continues to decline, recording 0.5
per cent for September, according to Investment Property Database.
Although the published equivalent yield remains at 8.1 per cent for the
month, underlying yield trends show further signs of lengthening, with a
small outward shift of 0.01 points. This resulted in a fall of 0.1 per cent
in capital values, the first time since May 1993 that capital growth has
gone negative across the whole IPD Monthly Index, taking the index down to
128.77. Rental values fell by 0.04 per cent in September, to give an index
value of 136.4 for September, compared with 136.45 the previous month.
For the three-month period of the third quarter, the rates of both total
return and capital values growth continue to show marked decline in
comparison with the first and second quarters.
The rate of all-property total return was 1.8 per cent for the three months
to the end of September, compared with 3.9 per cent for the second quarter,
7.8 per cent for the first quarter and 8.3 per cent for the fourth quarter
of 1993.
Capital value growth for the three months to September was -0.1 per cent
against 1.8 per cent for the quarter to June. However, rental value decline
has continued to slow in the past three months, to record -0.3 per cent
against -0.4 per cent for the second quarter.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Cost of library to be announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Firm projections of the costs of the new British library and its completion
date will be announced before the Budget, the Department of National
Heritage said yesterday.
Controversial sprinkler and cabling provisions will also be announced.
In July the Commons national heritage committee described the new library,
near London's St Pancras station, as 'one of the ugliest buildings in the
world' and said costs had increased to Pounds 450m from an original estimate
of Pounds 116m.
The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, is due to
investigate the delays and expense involved.
Yesterday the department confirmed that Mr Richard Pardey, the project
manager brought in from the private sector to oversee the building seven
years ago, was moving to a new position, liaising with the office's
investigation.
It said Mr Pardey was 'uniquely well-placed to be in charge of our
response'. His contract ends next year, and the department said his
successor would have a reasonable amount of time to do the job.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Minister disputes petrol criticisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday reaffirmed its advice to motorists to use unleaded
petrol in spite of criticism in a report by the Commons transport committee
on air pollution in London, Charles Batchelor writes.
It also said there was no evidence that super-unleaded petrol contributed
significantly to levels of benzene, which can cause cancer, although this
would be kept under review.
This sets the government in conflict with both the select committee and the
Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which reported on Wednesday.
Both urged bans on the use of super-unleaded because it contained high
levels of benzene.
The government and the two reports all draw different conclusions from the
scientific research carried out into the impact on health of the constituent
parts of unleaded fuel.
