FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Continental Airlines head quits

<TEXT>
Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, yesterday said that Mr
Robert Ferguson had resigned as chief executive and vice-chairman.
The move comes as the airline is struggling to correct operational problems
with its low-cost Continental Lite flights. The service, modelled on
Southwest Airlines' successful route system, was launched last year by Mr
Ferguson as part of a strategy to return Continental to profitability.
Yesterday the airline said it was making progress on improving reliability,
but admitted that the service was still not breaking even.
Mr Ferguson's departure was announced as Continental revealed a 9 per cent
downturn in third-quarter operating income to Dollars 82.8m, from Dollars
91m in the 1993 quarter. Revenues were down 6 per cent at Dollars 1.5bn.
Fare-cutting during the quarter was reflected in a 2.6 per cent decline in
the average yield per passenger mile.
However, net income more than doubled to Dollars 30.6m, or Dollars 1.03 a
share, against Dollars 12.4m, or 53 cents a year earlier. But the
improvement was mostly due to a Dollars 11.3m income tax provision taken in
the 1993 period.
Mr Gordon Bethune, the company's president, will assume overall direction of
both strategic and day-to-day operations. Mr Ferguson, 45, will stay on as a
director and consultant on overall strategic planning.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Baxter sales growth to be lower
than expected

<TEXT>
Baxter International, the US medical supplies and healthcare group that
completed a financial restructuring a year ago, said yesterday that future
sales growth would fall short of its earlier expectations, writes Richard
Waters.
The company said the outlook for the US healthcare market meant it would not
reach its forecast of growth 'in the high single digits'. It added, however,
that it would still meet earnings targets by holding down costs.
Baxter, like other hospital suppliers, faces pressure from big private
hospital groups like Columbia/HCA and National Medical to cut prices.

American Express, the US financial services and travel group, said it had
retained investment bankers to explore a possible sale of its Amex Life
Assurance unit, which has been approached by several insurers interested in
acquiring the business, Reuter reports.
American Express said it had recently decided that the Amex Life long-term
care insurance business was 'not a critical element in the company's
long-term financial services strategy'.
Amex Life, with about 400 staff, had Dollars 2bn in assets at the end of
1993. 'The interest we are seeing from potential buyers comes at a good
time,' said Mr Thomas Skiff, Amex Life president. 'These insurers see the
potential of this business and the opportunity to capitalise on our position
as the industry leader.'

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cray Research, the world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, said it
expected lower earnings in the fourth quarter and in 1995, in spite of
higher than expected third-quarter earnings.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 16m, or 62 cents a share, on
revenues of Dollars 220m, compared with Dollars 15.3m, or 58 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 202m in the same period last year. Wall Street analysts
had been projecting earnings of about 30 cents a share.
Cray noted that its quarterly earnings can swing significantly, depending
upon when it ships a single multi-million dollar supercomputer.
It said that it had signed almost as many new orders in the third quarter as
in the first half of the year. However, the average selling prices of Cray's
supercomputers is declining as it expands commercial sales.
'We expect to grow revenues for the full year, but we won't achieve our goal
of 10 per cent revenue growth,' said Mr John Carlson, chairman and chief
executive. The company projected lower revenues and income for 1995.
In the fourth quarter Cray will take a previously-announced restructuring
charge of about Dollars 8.5m, or 25 cents.
For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 46.2m, or Dollars 1.78 a
share, on revenues of Dollars 684.5m. This compares with net earnings of
Dollars 36.5m, or Dollars 1.40, on revenues of Dollars 592.2m in the same
period last year.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'. . . And she is mine for life.' We do not need to be 'of an impressionable
age' - we do not even need to be female - to recognise that, in Miss Jean
Brodie, Muriel Spark created a mythic heroine, absurd and disturbing, who
embodies all the inspiring yet misguided teachers whose attention at school
we once tried to win. On the one hand, this Edinburgh schoolteacher enjoying
her prime in the 1930s, is an icon as camp and transparent and quoteworthy
as EF Benson's Lucia - whom she so closely resembles, with her linguistic
and cultural pretensions. On the other, she is a pathetic martyr -
sacrificing adult love for the sake of her teaching and 'her girls',
intoxicating them with misplaced Romanticism, and wilfully making false
predictions of the glorious futures ahead of them. What are those futures
but projections of the lives she herself might have led?
Between these two extremes, Miss Brodie is 'loveable' - a word that acquires
crucial importance at the very end of the play. Her girls love her, and two
of her male colleagues are in love with her. She herself talks repeatedly of
the importance of love. Yet love is what she has placed on the altar of
teaching. And it is in her prediction that Jenny will be a great lover, a DH
Lawrence heroine, that she most obviously tries to make her students live
her life by proxy. She errs more criminally, however, in stuffing fascistic
propaganda into the girls' heads: which leads to the death of poor, silly
Mary MacGregor.
Indeed, her only true prediction is that Sandy will be a spy. Sandy, the
cleverest girl in the class, becomes the Judas among the Brodie girls,
because she sees that Miss Brodie has really been betraying them. This is
one of the ironies in which Spark's tale abounds. The play which Jay Presson
Allen made of the book catches many of them, though it goes overboard at
first on the Brodie cliches and campery. The role of the heroine was a
famous vehicle in the 1960s for Vanessa Redgrave (onstage) and Maggie Smith
(on film); and in the 1970s Geraldine McEwan starred in an excellent TV
version in which young Lynsey Baxter was a hauntingly acute Sandy.
It was high time for a new Miss Jean Brodie, and it was possible that
Patricia Hodge might be good in the role. She has the bite, the elegance,
the element of frigidity. She is, however, neither loveable nor
intoxicating. And, thanks surely to Alan Strachan's direction, her
performance stays entirely on the surface. I do not mean that she makes
overmuch of the role's camp bravado, but simply that she never really
reveals the woman's nervous system. There are psychosexual connections
between Miss Brodie's repressed love and everything most characteristic
about her teaching, but here no one helps us see them until the words spell
them out late in the proceedings. Hodge has her moments, especially when
speaking or behaving quietly; but moments do not make a role.
The most persuasive performance is given by David Yelland as Teddy Lloyd,
the married art master whom she loved and who loves her, though Strachan has
let Yelland be too dour. Edith Macarthur, as the headmistress Miss Mackay,
lacks gravitas, and Simon Scott, as the music teacher Mr Lowther, gives the
most superficial performance of all. The brief 30-years-later scenes, which
add such resonance to the story, are tepidly played here. Jackie Morrison as
Sandy (somewhat reminiscent of Baxter's TV performance) gives a very fair
account of a tricky role. But Strachan's direction fails most obviously in
his handling of schoolgirl life. He makes it a kind of Mallory Towers;
whereas the life of the Brodie girls, however funny, should be
psychologically sharp and alarmingly real. Miss Brodie needed to be revived,
but here she and her world are too safe, too light, too neat.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Minister quits to party relief and
surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a palpable sense of relief among Conservative MPs yesterday as the
news spread that Mr Neil Hamilton had agreed to resign as corporate affairs
minister.
But there was astonishment when the reason was announced.
Until Mr John Major started his statement to the Commons at 3.30pm it was
widely assumed that Mr Hamilton had been forced to resign because of a
defiant statement issued to local newspapers in Cheshire.
The prime minister's revelation that he had agreed to resign because the
impact of fresh allegations made on Monday 'disables him from carrying out
his responsibilities' stunned MPs on both sides of the House.
Mr Hamilton, a colourful rightwinger, had earlier appeared determined to
fight on against allegations that he asked Commons questions for Mr Mohamed
Fayed, the owner of Harrods, in return for cash and a week at the Paris
Ritz.
Mr Hamilton said in his statement: 'Since my appointment as a DTI minister I
have sought to undertake my responsibilities with scrupulous integrity and I
am dismayed by and resent these wild and false accusations.'
He said he had asked just three parliamentary questions relating to Mr
Fayed's House of Fraser and three relating to Lonrho - which had also sought
to purchase Harrods - after the trip to the Ritz.
The questions were prompted by a long-standing interest in competition
policy and 'my sympathy for House of Fraser's position', he said.
Mr Hamilton said he was advised when he became corporate affairs minister in
1992 that there was no legal reason why he should not perform ministerial
functions in relation to House of Fraser.
But 'in view of my partisan involvement . . . I specifically instructed my
officials that they were not to show me any papers relevant to the House of
Fraser, not to involve me in meetings, and to have any ministerial decisions
made by other ministers', he said.
Mr Hamilton's comments on the allegations were regarded by most Tory MPs as
typically robust. But there was widespread dismay and embarrassment about
his reasons for refusing to leave office to pursue a libel action against
The Guardian.
He said: 'Of course I could resign and fight a libel action from the back
benches. But the same argument could have applied to the prime minister in
respect of his action against the scurrilous Scallywag magazine, or against
other ministers who have fought libel actions.
'There is no reason whatsoever why a minister of the crown should not remain
in office whilst undertaking libel proceedings. Indeed the prime minister
did just that - and quite rightly so,' he said.
'In Britain, it is the established principle that a person is innocent
unless proved guilty. It is for the courts to decide upon these matters, not
the media or indeed anyone else.'
This appeared to have sealed Mr Hamilton's fate as a minister. In
particular, Tory MPs were aghast at his reference to Mr Major's successful
libel action against the New Statesman magazine, which reported unfounded
allegations in Scallywag that the prime minister had had an affair with a
Downing Street caterer, Ms Clare Latimer.
When it emerged in mid-morning that Mr Hamilton had cancelled an engagement
and was returning to London, it was widely assumed that he was about to be
sacked for issuing the statement without government approval.
In fact, Mr Hamilton had been called not to Number 10 but to Number 12
Downing Street, the home of Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip.
He was informed of the fresh allegations and agreed immediately to step
down.

</HEADLINE>

The Lords last night accepted plans by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
for secure training centres for persistent young offenders as peers debated
last week's Commons votes to reverse defeats inflicted by Lords on the
government.
Lord Carr, the Tory former home secretary who led July's revolt against the
proposals in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill, told peers: 'It
seems to me of no value to ask the Commons to think again for a second time.
Indeed I feel that constitutional damage might be done.'
Home Office minister Baroness Blatch insisted there had been concessions on
other aspects of the bill. She said: 'There is absolutely no guarantee that
this will work, but this is a very real and genuine attempt to address the
question of the young persistent offender.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Shorts receives Pounds 50m order from Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace company, has received a Pounds 50m order
for air defence missiles from Kuwait.
The announcement of the order came at the end of a visit to the emirate by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. The order was said to be a surprise
to the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Export Services Organisation and
Shorts.
The company will supply Kuwait with the Starburst shoulder-launched
anti-aircraft missile.
Starburst - the immediate successor to the Javelin system, which Shorts has
sold to more than 10 countries - has been developed to destroy
high-performance low-flying aircraft as well as attack helicopters.
The Starburst is a competitor to the US-made Stinger missile, which was used
by rebels in Afghanistan against Soviet aircraft.
Mr Terry Stone, Shorts Missile Systems chief executive, said: 'We are
delighted that Starburst was selected over its rivals to win this
prestigious multi-million pound contract.
'Its forward hit capability and unjammable laser guidance clearly proved it
is in a class of its own and we value highly the Kuwait government's
endorsement of Starburst's effectiveness.'
Shorts, which has been promoting Starburst in the Middle East, particularly
Kuwait, since 1991, said the contract would not affect plans to cut 240 jobs
at its plant in Belfast.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (20): Tenants look for
office flexibility - Increasing use of technology has presented problems to
developers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Developers came late to the world of high technology. Despite increasingly
frantic urgings from tenants and architects, they have only recently started
producing buildings which can cope with the computer age.
Now, however, they face a barrage of complaints that the pendulum has swung
too far. Many modern office blocks are too sophisticated, say the engineers
that face the task of running them. They also burn a large hole in tenants'
pockets.
Ironically, a groundswell of disdain remains about the poor standards of
most buildings to cope with office technology. Many high-tech companies
complain that they still find it hard to track down suitable premises. Even
non-technical ones groan at the difficulties of fairly simple internal
reorganisation of desks and equipment.
A computer on every desk was considered a Star Wars dream until the mid-80s.
But the 'Big Bang' financial revolution changed all that. Large groups went
wild in the scramble for a share of deregulated markets. Everyone expected
to to win a big slice, which meant grabbing more office space.
This coincided with a switch to computer-based dealing in securities,
currencies and a host of other markets. Big dealing floors became the norm
in new City blocks. But even the most mundane office was filling up with new
technology as equipment prices fell. By the end of the decade, Star Wars was
no longer a dream.
This sea-change in working methods transformed designs of certain buildings.
It was well known that electronics produce heat - but hate high
temperatures. Computer rooms had been sealed and air-conditioned for years.
Now that became the norm for a good deal of general office space, fitted
with false ceilings for ducting, sealed windows to keep in
expensively-cooled air and huge plant rooms on the roof.
Electronics also need miles of cables, and raised floors became the rage. At
one time designers were proposing enough space for a service engineer to
walk through without disturbing the drones above.
But all this costs money. Central London rents doubled during the boom -
partly to pay for the new services. Running costs also soared. Then came the
slump, and profit-strapped tenants began to worry about these high
occupation costs.
By then, however, developers had got into their stride and were offering
more and more sophisticated buildings. Air-conditioning became the norm,
even in buildings well outside the city centres, where it was justifiable to
seal buildings against pollution and noise.
Engineers and surveyors also started to question whether all this expensive
sophistication was really necessary. Peter Hill of the Building Research
Establishment Energy Conservation Support Unit (Brecsu) examined how office
equipment was used in 74 British companies. He found that manufacturers
vastly over-estimated the power demands - and therefore heat output. Staff
also tended to use equipment such as PCs in very different ways, so power
consumption ranged widely from 50 to 250 watts per person.
Developers ensure they can offer speculative buildings to the widest group
of potential tenants, so they made sure power could be provided at the top
of this range. Air-conditioning designed to cope with this higher figure
was, therefore, consistently running below capacity for the average tenant.
Users found themselves paying too much for the original system then extra
for running it inefficiently.
Efforts are now being made to adjust buildings closer to tenant needs by
bringing occupiers into the planning process. The British Council for
Offices, a group of agents and developers, has also produced guidance notes
that will avoid pitfalls.
The potential for savings shows up in a scheme being handled by cost
consultants AYH Partnership, which reduced the power loading for one
proposed London building from 25 to 15 Watts per sq metre. That will cut
future maintenance and running costs by 80,000 a year.
Over-specified buildings will be more appreciated as power consumption rises
to around 300 watts/person by the end of the decade. But this could be a
brief respite, as the move to 'green' PCs will cut that back to 200W in the
following 10 years, according to Brecsu.
Many high-tech businesses, however, are more concerned that buildings fall
below the specifications they need. Quality Software Products, the
recently-floated publisher of accountancy packages, was disappointed to be
forced out of its Leatherhead offices. The company had spent a great deal of
time and money altering the building to cope with computer equipment, but
needed space to grow.
Finding a suitable replacement was not easy, says QSP, although it
eventually tracked one down one at Leatherhead's Regent Park which had been
designed well enough to take the endless cabling, specialised lighting,
security systems and the Lan and Wan technology required.
This was at least an advance on the 1980s when the task proved impossible in
Gateshead, the company's birthplace. QSP had to build its own headquarters
because developers had nothing suitable to offer. Things have not improved
much today, as most of the suitable buildings are concentrated in the
south-east.
One of the main problems is finding a building flexible enough to take the
constant changes demanded by modern businesses, says Richard Hannam of QSP.
'You literally need to be able to shift walls over a weekend as teams are
moved around,' he says.
Cabling is also a big problem for the modern office. Within the first year
of occupation the average business moves half the work positions, according
to Stephen Hill of Oscar Faber Information and Communications. That
continues with an average 'churn' of 30 per cent a year.
More than half these moves require recabling, costing up to 400 per staff
member. Designers are now trying to solve this problem with the introduction
of structured wiring schemes under which a wide variety of power, data and
other cabling can be merged. These schemes pay for themselves within two or
three years by cutting the cost of churns to 20 per person, says Mr Hill.
Companies will need to take a much closer look in future at whether this
kind of scientific approach to fittings has gone into offices they are
seeking. High specifications may appear a godsend for those desperate to
find buildings geared to high technology, but they must be appropriate to
future needs.
The main criterion should be flexibility to change - either up or down the
technology ladder. Whether developers can come up with the goods is another
matter.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (21): Systems are under
scrutiny / a look at the health risks in using office equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mouse, a harmless looking device used by millions of people to control
their computer software, is the latest piece of electronic equipment to come
under scrutiny for health and safety reasons.
It is the subject an international standard covering health and safety for
high-tech offices being drawn up by national standards bodies worldwide, and
it will correlate with EU requirements.
Recent studies have shown that using a mouse can cause injuries, says Bjorn
Malmberg, technical co-ordinator at ICL Personal Systems. Most people place
the mouse to one side of the computer, where they have to extend their arm
to use it. The slight clicking action works muscles further up the arm, even
though most people are not aware of it. The further one has to stretch to
hold the mouse, the more strain is put on those muscles.
'Some applications require you to use the mouse a lot, and you can get
inflamed muscles' said Mr Malmberg. He recommends placing the mouse as close
in to the shoulder as possible to avoid the condition, which is known as
tennis elbow.
Another condition caused by the use of a mouse is carpal tunnel syndrome.
The symptoms are tingling feelings and pain in the thumb, index and middle
fingers and a weakening of the thumb. Carpal tunnel syndrome can happen to
mouse users if they rest their wrist on the desk while holding the mouse for
extended periods. This position pushes the wrist joint back at an angle,
causing pressure on the nerves which transmit signals between the hand and
the brain.
Some mouse products have been designed to allow the hand to rest in a more
natural position. The Dexxa mouse from Logitec, for example, is designed to
raise the wrist position. It costs about Pounds 15. The Microsoft Ergonomic
mouse costs Pounds 39. Mouse mats with a raised surface at one end are also
available, for about Pounds 10.
Similarly, new-style computer keyboards, designed for comfort, are coming on
to the market. Injuries caused by extended use of computer keyboards include
carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries. Mostly they occur
where the user performs repetitive tasks in a position which cramp the
hands, wrists or shoulders. This may be due to poorly designed equipment or
to poor posture, or both.
Software company Microsoft has just launched its Natural Keyboard. Shaped
like a wave with the two halves of the Querty keys sloping away from one
another at a 40 degree angle, it also has a sloping piece of plain plastic
along the front, intended as a palm rest and a pop-up stand underneath to
act as a wrist-rest.
Initially, the keyboard feels strange. But Microsoft claims that the slope
puts the shoulders in a more relaxed position does than the conventional
keyboard. The shoulders are opened out, instead of being hunched up. The
pop-up wrist-rest - Microsoft calls it a wrist leveller - forces the wrist
in a slightly downwards-sloping position for those who like to rest their
wrists while typing.
A rival product from US manufacturer Key Tronic uses a system of mechanical
levers underneath the individual keys to create a softer landing for the
fingers. Hard contact switches used to work the keys create a mechanical
resistance to the finger on conventional keyboards, which also make the
finger press directly down on the key - an unnatural movement.
The Key Tronic Pro Touch keyboard allows the fingers to arch over the
keyboard in a naturally comfortable position.
ICL's ergonomically designed keyboard helps minimise the strain on muscles
in the hands and forearms with a curved, sloping surface. It also
incorporates an anti-static device in the space bar - computers generate a
lot of static, which attracts dust and can result in headaches and
tiredness.
People who type on the keyboard while talking on the telephone are running
an additional risk. This issue has received little attention so far, but it
is known that holding the phone between the head and neck affects the
balance of the vertebrae in the neck, causing a condition called
Torticollis. Wearing a headset with a telephone microphone, could be the
solution because it lets the user have both hands free.
According to Stephen Murphy, of headset manufacturer Plantronics, headsets
are governed by strict regulations on sound quality. But headsets can be
expensive, with starting prices at Pounds 150 from either Plantronics or
rival manufacturer Racal Acoustics.
However, all manufacturers point out that improved equipment alone will not
prevent any of the debilitating medical conditions.
'Our keyboard does not prevent repetitive strain injury. Just as you don't
lose weight by drinking diet Coke,' said Richard Teversham, hardware product
manager at Microsoft. Mr Teversham believes that telling people how to
organise the overall work environment, will help them to help themselves.
For example, a desktop computer should be placed at an appropriate height
for the user. A footrest - costing between Pounds 15 and Pounds 40 - reduces
the strain on legs and feet.
A chair with built-in lumbar support - costing between Pounds 100 and Pounds
150 - supports the back. Lighting should not cause glare or reflections on
the screen. And users need to be educated to take breaks from keyboard or
mouse work and to maintain a good posture.
Alan Cuthbertson, an independent consultant, pointed out that all employers
in the European Union have a legal responsibility to educate their employees
about high-tech health and safety.
This follows the European directive 90/270 which was passed in 1992. Member
states were required to introduce legislation by January 1993, and
organisations have been given until 1996 to bring their offices in line.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (18): Multimedia skills
in demand - The shortage of staff needed for training programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Within four months of implementing an interactive multimedia training
project, the Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst in Germany had saved over
DM14.2m in time and travel costs.
By far the largest multimedia installation in Europe, with more than 2,000
'Learning Stations', the system was custom-built by VideoLogic using digital
video technology to provide a cost-effective solution for the training of a
widely dispersed workforce of more than 360,000 people. The initial
investment had paid for itself after putting just 100,000 staff through the
first two learning programmes.
In the training environment, the integration of personal computers with
digital video, audio and still images makes learning new skills an exciting
and positive experience.
Studies show that pupils learn new skills faster and information retention
rates are higher than they were with traditional aids such as flipcharts and
marker pens.
As a result the future of multimedia, particularly as a training aid, is
assured. According to Alan Binnie, recruitment director of consultants
Recruit Media, the multimedia markets is expected to top Pounds 7bn
worldwide this year.
He says: 'Sales of multimedia PCs with CD-Rom drives grew by over 160 per
cent last year and, if such drives were fitted to just a third of all PCs
expected to be sold in the UK in 1995, the potential market would increase
by 500 per cent to something like 1.5m.' However, he warns that as the rush
to supply the market takes off, so too will the demand for quality staff.
'Multimedia mixes sound, visual images and movement; and the creation of a
single product involves a whole range of new skills from computer
programming to graphic design. Lack of those skills could hold the UK back.'
That view is held by the West London Training &amp; Enterprise Council which
conducted a survey last year and found in the IT field alone a national
backlog of 50-100m man-days of computer skills training. Moreover, it
estimated that catching up though conventional methods would cost Pounds
10bn-20bn. New thinking is called for, the Tec's report concluded.
A growing number of organisations are keen to address the problem using new
technology. Recruit Media says that 60 per cent of companies have said that
they intend to employ multimedia staff within the next 12 months.
Unfortunately, 40 per cent of those already travelling the multimedia route
are experiencing difficulties in finding the right staff.
Mr Binnie says: 'We are getting companies like BP, the Automobile
Association, BBC Enterprises and ICL coming to us for trained, flexible and
creative staff and it is getting increasingly difficult to find them.
'Now that multimedia has progressed from a cottage industry to one of global
significance, we must address that skill shortage.'
Technology itself can help. For example, rather than rely on technical staff
and outside developers to create interactive multimedia training programmes,
British Airways is planning to use AimTech's CBT Express, said to be the
first computer-based training authoring software that makes training course
development fast, simple and accessible to non-technical personnel.
No scripting, flow charting or programming is required. The system uses
pre-built templates and colour backgrounds to simplify and accelerate the
applications development process. If the current trials are successful, BA's
training staff will be able to produce multimedia course material to
supplement the programmes being developed by IT staff who use AimTech's
IconAuthor, a more complex authoring tool that has already proved its worth
in developing interactive training courses for cabin crew.
Video has long been used in the training environment. But it can be
time-consuming winding tape backwards and forwards trying to find a
particularly section. Interactive video is one answer but the need to
implement sophisticated computer controls has, until now, made it an
unrealistic proposition for the mass market.
An interesting development from Japanese electronics giant Pioneer is an
interactive LaserDisc combined with bar code techniques. Each laser disc can
store up to 36 minutes of video or up to 54,000 still frames and photos, or
a combination, with each item or section given a unique barcode for fast
access purposes.
By running the barcode pen over identical supermarket-style barcodes in the
reference book, the relevant section of the programme will appear instantly
on the TV screen, complete with relevant photographs, slides, diagrams and
text.
A growing trend among trainers and lecturers is the use of a PC to create
their own training presentations. The addition of an LCD projection panel
provides the ultimate flexibility, enabling computer presentations to be
prepared in advance then altered quickly and easily up the last minute; an
impossible task if slides or OHPs have to be produced.
Distance learning, whereby individuals can learn new skills at any time at
any location is developing.
The one problem with it is the difficulty of interaction between trainee and
tutor. QData believes its development of the Marc PC-based software program
could be the answer. It enables a tutor to deliver training materials and
exercises to a group of dispersed trainees who can then participate in
one-to-one or group training sessions.
The tutor can take control of all screens on the network, or can ask remote
trainees to take control of the host computer and perform certain tasks
while the rest of the trainees watch. Messages can be sent to all trainees
simultaneously and work completed can be printed out locally or remotely.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (17): EDI traffic
increases - The electronic marketplace is on its way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growth of paperless trading using electronic data interchange (EDI) and
electronic mail is having a profound effect on the way some businesses
operate.
EDI involves the exchange of structured business documents, such as orders
and invoices, directly between computers. It is used mainly for
inter-company communications, where cutting out paper can significantly
speed up the processing and transmission of information.
But 'the most significant application of EDI worldwide is to make reductions
in inventory,' says Brian Dearing, a Europe-based vice-president at US EDI
supplier Sterling Software.
'For example,' says Mr Dearing 'clothes retailers are trying to improve
profitability by cutting down on inventory. Ideally, they only want to
re-order the stuff that sells otherwise they have to make huge markdowns at
the end of the season.
'But each time a garment is re-ordered that's an administrative task. So
unless the process is automated, it isn't practical to keep really low
levels of stock. One solution is to generate an EDI order every time an item
is scanned at the checkout till.'
In addition to improving profitability, a low inventory policy means that no
stockroom is required. Examples are S&amp;K Menswear in the US, which orders
goods in the minimum quantity and then re-orders what has just sold. And
Victoria's Secret, the US lingerie company, which also requires no stockroom
after implementing a low-inventory policy.
Mr Dearing believes that using EDI to improve asset management will
contribute far more to a company's profitability than simply using it to cut
costs in the accounts department.
For those who are planning to use EDI, there are a number of third-party
value-added network services (Vans) to choose from. In essence, these take
computer-generated orders or invoices and send them to trading partners
electronically.
EDI service providers include General Electric Information Services (Geis),
IBM, INS (now wholly-owned by Geis), BT, AT&amp;T and, most recently, Sterling
which has made its US EDI service available in Europe as Commerce: Network.
Some EDI Vans also offer electronic mail and, conversely, some email
suppliers offer EDI-like applications. Mr Dearing says: 'We've seen email
used in EDI communities where a retailer or manufacturer has a number of
suppliers and wants to tell them it has a new purchasing manager, or that
it's going to shut down for a few days.
'It's clear that greater use of email for electronic trading is going to
come, but a lot of the things customers want to do really lend themselves
more to electronic bulletin boards.' These allow information to be 'posted'
in an area of the EDI network where anyone can look at them.
The research consultancy Ovum* predicts that European EDI network service
revenue (including software and support for customer-premises equipment)
will grow at 25 per cent a year from Ecu260m (Dollars 322m) in 1993 to
Ecu588m in 1997.
By then, it expects 90 per cent of European EDI traffic to be based on the
international Edifact standard, as compared with less than 50 per cent last
year.
Ovum also predicts strong growth for electronic mail services, such as the
Internet. It forecasts that total European email revenues will grow at 53
per cent a year from Ecu223m in 1993 to Ecu1,453m in 1997.
A big part of this growth will come from new users signing up to use the
Internet system. Extensively used by the research and academic community on
a not-for-profit basis, the Internet now has at least 15m users around the
world, according to Ovum's estimate, and at most between 25m and 30m.
The sheer size of its user base is attracting commercial interest in spite
of the Internet's uncommercial image. Information provider Pipex points out
that for only a few pounds, a company can put an article on the Internet
system which can reach a potentially large audience.
In addition to email, the Internet provides databases, news discussion
groups (such as those on electronic bulletin boards), long-distance
computing and the ability to transfer data or software programs.
Rose Lockwood of Ovum says: 'Recent reports estimate that over half of
Internet's users are now commercial bodies, yet there are still many
barriers to, and much debate concerning, the commercial use of the
Internet.'
For example, the National Science Foundation Network Internet backbone (the
NFSNet) deems for-profit activities to be unacceptable. But commercial
suppliers are forming groups which can interconnect without such
restrictions.
As a result an increasing number of fee-charging services are appearing.
These include Clarinet - an electronic publishing service, providing news
and information, plus live news from the UPI wire service.
Many major online databases, such as Dialog and Lexis can also be accessed
via the Internet.
The Internet is often mentioned as an early example of the information
highway. As conceived by US president Bill Clinton and vice-president Al
Gore, information highways - national information networks - will carry
information, entertainment, interactive games, and services such as home
banking and shopping into homes and businesses.
The plan is that users will plug into these highways using multimedia
terminals (which combine television, images, sound and computing power) in
the home or office. Alternatively, they will link up via 'smart' boxes used
with their television sets.
But as well as representing a huge business opportunity for all manner of
industries - such as entertainment, publishing, financial services,
telecoms, computers and consumer electronics - information highways also
present a threat to established ways of offering services.
For example, Mel Simon, IBM venture manager for the information
super-highway, points out that the presence of a national information
infrastructure would make it relatively cheap for new direct suppliers (such
as the telephone-based bank First Direct and Directline insurers) to enter
the market and compete for business.
But until computer networks, such as the Internet, become easier for
ordinary mortals to use, both the threats and the commercial opportunities
will be more imagined than real.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (19): Ease and speed top
the list - Monica Horten finds fierce competition in electronic information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's not what you've got, it's how you access it. In the fast expanding
world of electronic information services, that is becoming the rule which
differentiates service offerings.
Business information has been available on-line for many years from service
providers such as Official Airline Guide, Infocheck, Kompass Online, various
newswires, and the Financial Times's Profile news and reports database
service. Most are supplied through third-party network providers such as
Compuserve, as well as by direct connection. But none of the services have
yet achieved the widespread use that they deserve.
One reason is that they have proved difficult to use, often providing users
with very little on-screen assistance. 'Most on-line databases are not
particularly friendly, and by design are geared towards information services
professionals,' said Mike Sullivan, of Reuters business information products
group.
Another issue is charging. Services traditionally charge users by the
minute, making searches expensive. And researchers may have to access more
than one database to conduct a comprehensive search - for example, to find
competitive product information they would check news archives, companies
listings and research reports.
Reuters Business Briefing, a new Reuters service launched last year, has
improved the user interface with new Windows-based software. It lets people
search its 600 sources information by clicking through pull-down menus of
subject codes. It also has a simplified charging structure - a monthly
subscription of 495, for which users get 20 hours free search time.
A Windows interface is becoming de rigeur for all new information services.
According to Mr Sullivan, users today tend to be business executives, who
need to search data for themselves. The executives demand that a system is
easy to use. In the past, the typical user was a librarian - an information
professional - who did the search at the request of an executive.
Users also demand fast data retrieval. Business Briefing claims to pull up
data in less that three seconds. So does a rival service called Tel-Me from
Birkenhead-based start-up company Phone-Link.
Tel-Me's concept is to take a number of commonly used databases and develop
a common interface to make searching simpler. The 10 services offered
include the Automobile Association and BT databases, as well as UK railway
timetables, companies database Infocheck, and news wires. Tel-Me charges
only 300 annual subscription, but adds a fixed charge per data retrieved:
from 12p for a phone number, up to 24p for a company report.
Compuserve, the on-line service based in Columbus, Ohio, not only has a
Windows interface but uses a special interface to third-party databases
which makes them easier to use than the original service provided direct
from the information provider. And it lets users save information to their
hard disk, so they can read it off-line, cutting on-line costs.
Compuserve's philosophy is to offer as much variety of information as
possible. It has more than 2,000 databases, including the Associated Press,
Deutsche Presse Agentur and Press Association newswires and business
services such as Dun and Bradstreet, Kompass Online, Extel Financial. Market
reports from Mintel and US and UK trade marks are also on the system.
Users have to pay each time they access these services - except for the
newswires which are provided free with the Dollars 7.95 monthly
subscription.
The advantage is that there is no need to pay an individual subscription to
each database. So a user can do a credit check, look up a share price, get a
company report and so on, with relative ease.
Compuserve has a great appeal for smaller businesses, which cannot afford
subscriptions to so many services at once. It has made a concerted drive
into European markets in the past two years and has made the greatest
inroads in the UK and Germany, where it has 65,000 subscribers in each
country.
'There are up-market bulletin board services and there are high cost
business services, which sell direct. The wedge is in the middle where
people want a broad service,' said Neil Laver, of Compuserve's UK office.
The most immediate rival to Compuserve is the Internet, which claims to have
30m users worldwide. However, the Internet began as a network for academics
and boffins, and this remains its prime function.
According to UK company Pipex, which supplies Internet connections, the
leading business information suppliers have yet to come on-line. Some, such
as Dow Jones and Dun and Bradstreet are in the process of connecting.
Industry observers point out that searching the Internet can be difficult.
It has no central organisational focus, which means that technical help may
be minimal, depending on the supplier offering the connection. It may also
be complicated to hook up to some of the information suppliers.
Commercial information suppliers will not offer their services free of
charge - as is the academic information - and users may have to contact the
information supplier directly to obtain an account. This is not necessary on
Compuserve.
Neither is it necessary on Maid, a London-based company which claims to
offer a much more intuitive means of searching multiple databases. With
Maid, one can search all the databases on the system - including news wires,
company checks, stock broker reports and research material - just by
entering a single query. Thus, if one enters 'telecommunications in
Thailand', it will provide news cuttings, broker, company and analyst
reports that are relevant.
Maid has also invested in a novel indexing system. Professional indexers
provide links between information which is related even though the actual
word being searched on is not included. For example, if asked to search on
'toothpaste' it would pick up an article on oral hygiene that did not
mention the word 'toothpaste'. But clearly, the article would be relevant
for someone interested in the subject.
According to founder Dan Wagner, customers are switching from other services
to Maid. So far, the company has only targeted large financial institutions
and major companies.
The client list already includes 93 banks, and one third of the UK's largest
companies. However, it will be made available for smaller businesses next
year, when a Windows version of the interface software becomes available.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (16): Making savings all
round - Reduced business travel is not the only benefit of
video-conferencing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a series of false starts, video-conferencing is taking off. Tumbling
prices and smaller systems - including the first desktop systems - mean that
video-conferencing can now provide a real alternative to business travel.
In 1984, a video-conferencing system would have cost Pounds 250,000
according to Phil Simmonds, marketing manager of GPT Communications
Services. 'Today, a professional quality system the size of a television set
can be bought for around 10 per cent of that price,' says Mr Simmonds. And
it is possible to buy systems which are even smaller and cheaper.
There are three main types of video-conferencing system: large systems
designed to equip video-conferencing studios for between Pounds 25,000 and
Pounds 30,000; smaller roll-about (movable) systems for between Pounds
15,000 and Pounds 17,000, and desktop systems. BT, for example, sells a
desktop system the size of a portable television for Pounds 5,999.
A lower cost option than using a dedicated video-conferencing unit is to add
video-conferencing capabilities to a personal computer. Judith Jeffcoate of
the research consultancy Ovum believes that between 1996 and the end of
1998, revenues from PCs equipped for video-conferencing will exceed those
from conventional video-conferencing equipment.
An increasing number of suppliers have developed or are selling systems of
this kind including Canada-based Northern Telecom (with the Visit system
distributed by UK computer dealers P&amp;P), US semiconductor company Intel,
AT&amp;T GIS (Global Information Solutions), BT, IBM, Apple, Picturetel,
Olivetti and Griffin Sight &amp; Sound.
Some computers now come fully equipped for video-conferencing, allowing
users to transmit live video images of themselves to other,
similarly-equipped users, and to see on their PC the person they are talking
to. For example, Sun Microsystems sells a Unix workstation which includes
camera, real-time video capture and compression and a storage disk.
But most users will have to buy a special kit if they want to carry out a
video-conference in a window on their personal computer.
For example, Olivetti, IBM, BT and ICL sell kits which include a small video
camera which sits on top of the PC, a card which slots into the PC and
software (some of the hardware in these kits was developed by BT).
The kit makes it possible for users to transmit still or moving video
images, photographs or sound. In most cases users will also need an ISDN
(digital) phone line to enable them to carry out a phone conversation and
transmit data (such as video images) at the same time.
Many PC-based products allow people engaged in a video-conference to point
to or edit information they can both see on their screens. Intel says that
with its system, users at far-flung sites can edit a report together, both
looking at the same version on their screens. The systems is modular so US
users can either buy the ProShare shared editing software separately or the
full kit.
New products are also coming to the market. In late October, BT plans to
launch Presence, which it describes as the UK's first self-contained desktop
ISDN videophone and the VC6000 roll-about video-conferencing system.
A report from the Economist Intelligence Unit, International Business
Travel: a changing profile, suggests that video-conferencing will gain
popularity. 'Video-conferencing is perceived to have several benefits and it
is perhaps the ability to streamline travel costs that is considered to be
the major one,' says the report.
Benefits can include:
Time savings. Citibank Europe saves 200 man hours of travel time per month
by using video-conferencing for Europe-USA staff meetings and its chairman's
speeches.
Cost savings. ICL, the UK computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, says
it makes 50 per cent savings on travel costs through using
video-conferencing for board meetings and links with Japan.
Faster product development. When Ford of Europe introduced
video-conferencing it helped to cut down product-development times. Staff at
different sites can hold a video-conference to sort out a problem, rather
than travelling for a day.
Greater team spirit. Ford also believes that video-conferencing helps to
hold different groups together.
Shorter meetings. Users of studio-based systems such as pharmaceutical
company SmithKline Beecham, find that video-conferencing promotes regular,
shorter meetings. This is because its video-conferencing suites are booked
in advance, end automatically, and are often charged out to the department
using them.
Better access to experts. UK high-street bank National Westminster has
installed a number of AT&amp;T videolink services at 10 branches. This allows
customers to speak directly from their local branch to NatWest's household
insurance specialists located in Bristol.
But video-conferencing systems have their limitations. Mr Simmonds says:
'They aren't good for the initial meeting with someone - it's better to meet
people first in the flesh.' This is especially true of PC-based systems,
which usually provide video images at 15 frames a second. At this speed,
images will be jerky, so if business contacts make even small movements, it
will look as if they are swaying around wildly.
As well as keeping still, it is also important to try and establish eye
contact by looking into the camera, whether in a one-to-one or a large
video-conferencing meeting. In larger, 'multipoint' video-conferencing
meetings, people should speak one at a time, because it is harder than in
face-to-face meetings to listen to a babble of voices.
Adrian Butcher, BT's general manager for videotelephony, says a number of
factors must be considered when conducting a video-conference, but
'multipoint tends to encourage the disciplines that ought to prevail in a
business meeting. People tend to think about what they are going to say
before they say it, and there is usually a chairman in charge'.
He believes that, unlike many technologies, video-conferencing systems
(especially the smaller ones) can sometimes pay for themselves immediately
through savings in travel costs.
But he does not think that businesses should look at cost savings alone.
'The real power of these systems comes from faster decision-making,' he
says. 'Suddenly, dialogue can proceed at the speed of dialogue, not at the
speed of people's diaries.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (14): Revitalising a
stagnant market - The future for mobile data is in niche applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD HANDFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision this autumn by the Department of Trade and Industry to invite
bids for the UK's fifth mobile data licence caused amazement in an industry
that has had to familiarise itself with unpleasant surprises since its
inception five years ago.
'Anyone applying for a licence now would have to be crazy,' was the reaction
of one industry executive to the DTI decision to increase competition in a
market where customers are today only a tenth of what was predicted three
years ago.
The three existing operators - Ram Mobile Data, Cognito and Paknet - only
have 5,000-10,000 customers between them compared to industry predictions in
1991 that a market of 100,000 would have developed by the end of this year.
The high aims were based on the assumption that mobile data would breach a
huge market of business users. Any traveller away from the office, it was
argued, would want to retrieve information from an office database or
immediately input new data, a successful sale, for example, rather than
waiting to return to the office.
Instead, it appears the future for mobile data is in developing a number of
niche applications, although not all of them popular. For instance, Ram
Mobile Data's terminals are used by traffic wardens in a number of London
councils who issue a total of 5m parking tickets each year. The wardens can
send and receive details about illegally parked vehicles far more
efficiently this way than by using alternatives such as a cellular
telephone.
Other niche applications include emergency organisations such as the fire
and ambulance services, parcel delivery companies and Trafficmaster, the UK
traffic monitoring system which uses the Paknet network to relay signals
containing information about traffic conditions collected from roadside
monitors to the company's control centre.
The system then uses a paging network to carry the same information on to
its subscribers in their cars.
The radio-paging industry is casting around for new approaches to avoid
being superceded by cellular operators who are offering increasingly
competitively-priced handsets and tariff packages.
Aside from initiatives such as Trafficmaster, paging operators are looking
at two ways to revitalise a stagnant market. One is to maintain paging's
price advantage over cellular telephones by introducing new, cheaper tariff
packages. The other is to make the pager a more sophisticated product that
offers similar services to a mobile data network.
This autumn has seen the launch by BT and Mercury - two of the UK's four
paging operators of a new kind of paging service first developed in Sweden.
The market certainly needs this kind of initiative. In the past year the
number of subscribers has grown by only about 780,000. Mercury estimates the
new services will add between 100,000 and 200,000 new subscribers.
The service, known as CPP or Calling Party Pays, is an attempt to widen the
audience for paging services to include consumer as well as the business
user.
CPP services eliminate one-off connection charges and monthly subscription
leaving the user only having to pay the price of the pager.
The operator recoups the revenue lost on connection and rental charges by
charging callers a premium price for leaving a message for the subscriber.
Currently calls to pagers are billed at the standard local rate for calls.
BT has given its service an extra twist by introducing it with a wristwatch
pager - the first in the UK - manufactured by Swatch. It hopes the pager
will deliver the same kind of youthful audience drawn to the One-2-One
cellular service, launched last year.
The second new innovation likely to reach the UK soon is the launch of
services based on a new, digital technology that will enable operators to
offer a service that will deliver longer messages at higher speeds than is
now possible.
In addition, the new service known as Ermes (European radio message system)
enables users to send and access information from office databases while
they are on the move.
Aside from teething problems, such as the discovery that in Germany Ermes
causes interference to television pictures, it is already available in
France and will soon be offered in other European countries. It is likely to
further add to the competition faced by the UK's mobile data operators.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (15): Mechanical voices a
mixed blessing / A look at the increasing use of messaging systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Susie, a New York-based stockbroker working for a European bank, kept
leaving messages on the answerphone of a potential client. After six months,
the client rang her and told her he only dealt with US banks.
Her story shows just how prevalent answerphones and voice mailboxes are
becoming in US business, not only as a means for staff to receive messages
when they are absent from their desks but also as a way of filtering calls.
Voice mail and answerphones are also becoming more common in Europe, where
growing call volumes are turning the telephone into a mixed blessing.
According to UK high street retailer Dixons, among the most popular
answering machines are those which add a date and time to each message (with
a little help from a computer-generated voice). The cheapest of these is a
Pounds 39.99 machine from Betacom. BT's Response 50 goes a step further by
bleeping when any messages have been left.
But it may not be necessary to buy a separate answering machine at all.
Increasingly, answering machines are being included in composite products
such as Amstrad's model which combines one with a fax machine. The latest
multimedia home PC from Compaq includes an answerphone with 12 segments - so
that parents, for instance, do not have to waste time listening to messages
meant for their children.
For the corporate environment, voice messaging systems provide similar
features to answerphones but can do much more. At their simplest, they allow
callers to leave a message if the person they want to talk to is not
available. By dialing the appropriate voice mailbox number (and a code),
users can play messages back or forward them to another mailbox.
But all too often systems are implemented poorly, leading to horror stories
of 'voice mail jail', where the caller is trapped in the system and bounced
from one voice mailbox to another.
However, individual users can be at fault. As a consequence, some US
companies have appointed 'voice mail police'. These are staff tasked with
spying on colleagues to see if they are changing their greetings regularly -
for instance, when they are on holiday - and actually listening to their
messages.
The penalty for breaking the rules is to lose your voice mailbox and once
again be subjected to a barrage of calls.
Another potential problem with voice mail is security. This is because,
depending on how they are set up, PABXs (switchboards) with integrated voice
mail can be vulnerable to hackers.
If special tones are used to operate a voice mailbox, these can sometimes be
used to operate the PABX. In this way, a number of hackers have used US
company switchboards to run up huge bills.
The Voice Messaging Educational Committee (VMEC), whose members include
AT&amp;T, BT Mobile, Octel Communications and VMX will publish a guide to voice
mail security next month.
In spite of security problems, use of voice mail is expanding in the US. A
study there by the voice systems consultancy Vanguard Communications says
that the US voice mail industry grew over 20 per cent last year, with sales
topping Dollars 1.2bn.
Don Van Doren, president of Vanguard, says: 'The bottom line is that voice
mail improves communication, saving time and money.'
In Europe the profile of public voice messaging is increasing, largely
because cellular phone operators provide voice mailboxes linked to users'
mobile phones. The market for voice processing as a whole (including voice
messaging) is growing at 35-40 per cent a year in Europe, according to Robin
Scurlock, head of BIS Strategic Decision's messaging programme.
He says: 'At this year's Voice '94 show much of the technology that had been
promised was on display especially in the area of call centres and voice
integration on the local-area network.'
Call centre systems are designed to capture the three out of every four
calls that the voice messaging industry estimates fail to get through first
time. The systems are designed to allocate calls to the next free person in
a telesales environment and to provide a computer screen full of information
on any customer that has called before. They can also provide a list of
calls which need to be made.
In the area of voice integration, GPT launched a product at Voice '94 which
allows users on a PC network to get a list of all their fax, voice and
electronic mail messages.
They can then use a mouse to click on the ones, they want to see or hear.
Suppliers which have (or are developing) integrated products for the desktop
include VMX, Octel Communications, C3, Applied Technology, Dialogic, Active
Voice, Radish Communications and Converse.
However, Elaine Cascio, a consultant at Vanguard Communications, warns that
no one really knows whether users want to be able to see all their different
types of messages at once.
There are many different types of voice processing (of which voice mail is
one). They go by a confusing array of names and there is some overlap
between them. Audiotex is one of the simplest categories and is used for
0898 recorded information, such as racing results.
Another category is interactive voice response (IVR). This is the type of
technology used in some home banking and home shopping systems. It might,
for example, prompt the use to 'press one to check your bank balance' or
'press two to order a cheque book'.
These systems effectively link a voice interface to a computer database.
They allow customers to input and retrieve information either by using a
touch-tone phone or by using speech recognition technology.
Interest in voice technology is growing as computers and telecommunications
begin to converge. For example, PC software companies like Microsoft and
Novell are muscling in and trying to set competing standards for CTI
(computer telephony integration).
But national character plays a big part in the level of adoption. BIS says
people in the Netherlands and Sweden are less keen to talk to machines than
the English.
Americans are probably the most comfortable with speaking to machines. In
Japan it might be hard to find an executive willing to leave messages on an
answerphone for six months.
Scurlock says: 'In Japan the receptionist often takes the message verbally
and then records it on a machine.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (12): Wireless office
beckons - Prospects for cordless business communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By the end of the decade, market analysts predict that up to a fifth of new
office telecommunications equipment installed will be cordless.
'Wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing in 1993 to
nearly 20 per cent of the market by the year 2000 while wireline-based PABXs
(switchboards) and key systems dip correspondingly,' said Frost &amp; Sullivan,
the US-based market research firm in a recent report.
Systems manufacturers such as GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture
between Germany's Siemens group and Britain's GPT, tend to be more cautious
suggesting that cordless systems could take between 10 and 15 per cent of
the market by the turn of the century.
Either way, the projected growth of cordless business communications systems
is impressive - driven by falling hardware prices and the perceived benefits
in terms of mobility, flexibility and productivity.
The Frost &amp; Sullivan report predicted: 'The wireless office will gain
popularity as the price of systems decline. Prime target end-users include
salespersons, top management, employees in distribution and manufacturing
firms and healthcare personnel.
'The popularity of cellular phones and the emergence of personal
communications systems will stimulate use of wireless handsets for
in-building use as users increasingly seek the same convenience they are
used to outside the office inside buildings.'
Basic cordless telephones have been available for use in the home since the
early 1980s. Generally these systems include a portable handset which
communicates by radio with a single fixed base-station which is then in turn
connected to the public telephone network.
In recent years technical advances, particularly the switch from analogue to
digital radio transmission, has greatly increased the scope of cordless
office systems enabling high-capacity systems using multiple micro-cellular
base stations and capable of serving hundreds or even thousands of business
users to be constructed.
The first large-scale business cordless systems were launched in 1992.
The advantages of cordless business telephone systems are fairly obvious. In
particular, workers are no longer tied to the location of a particular
hard-wired telephone extension and incoming calls have a much better chance
of reaching their intended recipient.
Surveys have shown that up to 70 per cent of all business calls fail to
reach their target on the first attempt often leading to what has been
dubbed 'telephone tag'. Cordless systems can reduce this call failure rate
substantially, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction while cutting
cost by removing the need to return calls.
Ericsson, the European telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims
that cordless business systems can save customers up to 30 per cent of their
bills as a result.
Cordless systems can also save on the costs of rewiring and other
configuration operations which can be around 10 per cent of the capital cost
of the system for organisations running medium-sized or large PABX systems.
In addition, as Multitone, the UK-based pager and cordless telephone system
supplier, points out, cordless systems are extremely cost-effective to run
once installed since there are no airtime charges, internal calls are free
and external calls cost the same as from an ordinary desk telephone.
Multitone's CS500 system connects directly to a PABX and so no expensive
changes need to be made to an existing hard-wired system and the same desk
telephones and extension numbers can continue to be used.
Recognising that many companies cannot justify the cost of covering a whole
site with a cordless system, the CS500 also comes with paging software
enabling handset users to roam outside cordless coverage and still stay in
touch.
However, if cordless business systems are to flourish, there are several
obstacles to overcome. In particular there are two main rival cordless
business system technology standards, CT2 (Cordless Telephony 2) and Dect
(Digital European Cordless telecommunications.)
CT2 was the first digital cordless technology to be developed in the UK
during the 1980s and has been adopted as an interim European standard. It is
the same technology used for Telepoint services in Europe and elsewhere.
GPT Communications Systems and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying
cordless office systems which are based upon CT2 digital technology - BT
also supplies re-badged Northern Telecom systems and Multitone's CS500
cordless system is supplied under an agreement with Northern Telecom.
The Canadian group, which is also developing a Dect system for up to
1,000-users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2
cordless business systems in Europe in March last year and has sold over
1,000 systems in 13 European countries and the Middle East since then and
over 2,000 systems worldwide.
CT2's supporters claim that it is a proven and cost-effective technology
ideally suited to small and medium-sized offices. CT2 handsets currently
cost about a third of the price of their Dect rivals and are likely to
retain a price advantage because of the adoption of the technology outside
Europe - for example, in the Far East.
The rival Dect standard is backed by ETSI (the European Telecoms Standards
Institute) and was designed to solve the problem of providing cordless
phones in high-density business environments such as offices.
Five of Europe's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel,
Ericsson, Nokia, Philips and Siemens - which between them represent nearly
70 per cent of the European PABX market adopted the Dect standard in March
1993 and the first Dect systems begun to appear shortly afterwards.
Ericsson has been one of the most active promotors of Dect systems and
launched its Freeset system in Europe last autumn although it has been
selling similar systems outside Europe for some time.
Freeset systems have already been installed in manufacturing factories,
hospitals and 'offices of the future' such as Digital Equipment's futuristic
headquarters in Stockholm.
In time, telecommunications strategists believe cordless office
telecommunications systems will be integrated with other digital telecoms
services including GSM (global system for mobile) and PCN services, and with
wireless local area networks linking desktop computers, workstations and
other devices.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (13): Widening the
network - Joia Shillingford finds new openings in the switchboard market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for office PABXs (switchboards) is growing so slowly that all the
leading suppliers are scrambling to find new sources of revenue. Bryan Van
Dussen, an analyst at the Yankee Group Europe, says the industry is almost
dead, with only 2-3 per cent growth a year worldwide. However, two new
technologies present opportunities for growth: wireless PABXs and multimedia
(the convergence of sound, image, text and computing).
Wireless PABXs allow users to make and receive calls using cordless
handsets. It makes no difference where abouts they are in the office, so
long as they are within reach of a radio base station. One or more base
stations will be connected to the office PABX, which links users to the
fixed phone network.
The beauty of the technology is that companies do not need to throw out
their old switchboard to use it. It is possible to buy an add-on device
which plugs into a standard PABX and links it to one or more base stations.
It is also possible for fixed-phone and cordless users to co-exist on the
same switchboard.
This is important because not all company workers need cordless handsets,
and because equipping a cordless user will cost more. According to Mr Van
Dussen, the average cost of connecting an office worker to a standard PABX
is Dollars 350 including the handset and infrastructure. The cost of
equipping a cordless user is about three times more expensive at Dollars
1,000, and it can be more if a lot of base stations are required.
High prices help to explain why the wireless PABX market has been relatively
slow to take off. Other inhibitors to growth include conflicting standards
and a limited choice of products.
The development of desktop multimedia applications could also add lustre to
the PABX industry. Two main multimedia applications involve the PABX,
according to Mr Van Dussen. They are:
Desktop video-conferencing and
Collaborative whiteboarding.
The first enables PC users to see a video image of the person they are
talking to on the phone. The moving video image is displayed in a 'window'
on their PC.
The second enables PC users in different places to look at the same image or
text in a window on their PCs.
As with a real whiteboard, they can annotate the image, which could be
anything from a diagram to a spreadsheet. Whiteboarding and desktop
video-conferencing can be used either separately or simultaneously.
Because such applications are now possible, US computer companies such as
Intel, Microsoft and Novell have started to become more interested in voice
technology. This has led software companies such as Microsoft and Novell to
try and set standards for the way PCs instruct PABXs. Each 'standard' has
its own supporters among computer companies.
Microsoft has defined Tapi (Telephony Applications Programming Interface)
and Novell has come up with a rival definition, Tsapi (Telephony Services
Applications Programming Interface).
Novell and Microsoft are each hoping that their standards will be used to
develop CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) applications, where computers
and PABXs work closely together.
Mr Van Dussen describes his dream CTI application as a computer database
linked to a PABX. His phone would be answered automatically and calls routed
according to the phone number of the caller (this will be possible when BT's
calling line identification service is launched).
A software program would determine from the database whether the incoming
call should be routed to his voice mailbox, his secretary or directly to
him. In certain cases, it would just hang up on the caller.
Such call-routing applications are useful to telephone-sales centres. There
is also demand for CTI in many other areas, for example order-taking, where
phone orders go straight into a computer.
The Yankee Group is positive about the opportunities for PABX suppliers to
penetrate some of the new markets created by developments in wireless
technology, multimedia and computer telephone integration.
It believes that Dect will grow rapidly as a wireless PABX application,
rising from less than 0.1m lines installed in 1994 to more than 2.6m in the
year 2000.
In addition, Cordless Dect-based phones, such as those sold by Siemens of
Germany, could one day be used to bypass the local loop (such as BT's local
phone network in the UK) and provide direct connection to long-distance
carriers such as Mercury.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): Cutting the cost of
calling - Mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hollywood would have us believe that mobile phones are the answer to life.
In between the bullets, Keanu Reeves, hero of the high-adrenalin movie
'Speed' spends hours on a mobile. In Harrison Ford's in 'Clear and Present
Danger', mobile phones are used to run a covert mission.
Reality soons parts from fantasy. Mr Reeves' mobile batteries never seem to
wear out. And Harrison Ford is not seen paying any phone bills. But for the
company whose phones aren't running on charisma, paying the bill is a costly
business.
One way of keeping costs down when phoning the office rather is to link the
office PABX (switchboard) directly to a mobile phone network.
Even if a company has only five heavy mobile phone users calling the office
regularly, this approach can cut costs by up to 45 per cent, according to
Mike Short, a spokesman for cellular network operator Cellnet.
To get these savings, a company must rent a telecoms line of up to 30km from
Mercury or BT and sign up for Cellnet's Call Access service or Vodafone's
Vodanet.
The leased line will link the PABX to a switching centre (or a radio base
station), which is part of the mobile phone network. The centre will switch
calls between the PABX and the cellular network.
Call Access and Vodanet can cut the cost of calls to and from the office
because these calls don't have to travel through the BT or Mercury network.
Another advantage is that dialing and call set-up times are faster.
Vodafone spokesman Mike Caldwell says that when he wants to call another
member of staff from his mobile, he simply dials a short code (91 in this
case), followed by the colleague's extension number. The call does not have
to be answered by the receptionist but goes straight to his colleague's
desk.
Incoming calls to staff who are out of the office can also be handled more
conveniently. If they cannot be dealt with by someone who is in the
office,they can be transferred to the mobile user - without the caller
having to dial another number.
Vodanet and Call Access can be used with either analogue (traditional)
mobile services or the newer GSM (Global System for Mobile) services.
But whether a company wants to link its PABX to a mobile phone network, or
simply use mobiles by themselves, it is better to opt for phones based on
digital technology, such as GSM or PCN (Personal Communications Network) - a
variant on GSM.
This is because digital technology has a number of advantages over analogue
technology:
Clearer conversations. Digital technology cuts out background noise on
mobile phones just as it does on compact discs.
Greater security. Digital signals are encrypted electronically before they
are sent and this makes eavesdropping more difficult.
Faster connection. Once the number has been dialed on a digital phone, the
call will be connected immediately. On an analogue phone call set-up times
are about six or seven seconds.
Reduced congestion. GSM networks can cope with eight times as much traffic
as analogue systems. This reduces the possibility of congestion. PCN
networks are also able to handle more traffic than can the analogue systems.
Pan-European coverage. GSM is becoming the standard for new European digital
mobile phone services and has been adopted in many other parts of the world.
Handsets bought in one country can be used to send and receive calls in
another through so-called roaming agreements with national service
providers. Very limited overseas roaming is also possible for users of PCN
services.
Better transmission for mobile data. It is easier to transmit data over
digital mobile phone networks than over their analogue counterparts.
Vodafone will be launching the UK's first GSM data communications service,
Vodafone Data on 19 October.
Market researchers are predicting strong growth for digital mobile networks.
Dataquest forecasts that there will be 8.31m GSM subscribers in Europe by
1996. High growth is also expected for UK PCN networks with Mercury's
One2One gaining over 120,000 subscribers since its launch last autumn.
There are plenty of digital mobile phone services to choose from. In most
European countries including the UK there are two competing GSM networks,
and in a few, PCN networks have also been licensed. The disadvantage is that
the handsets cost more than those for analogue services.
In the UK the main suppliers of GSM networks are Vodafone (with two GSM
tariffs: EuroDigital and MetroDigital) and Cellnet. Registration and monthly
charges for using their GSM services are similar to those for their analogue
services. But UK GSM handsets cost Pounds 100 more than equivalent analogue
handsets and typically range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 500.
Handsets for using either of the UK's two PCN networks: Mercury's One2One or
Orange from Hutchison Telecom are also expensive. Whereas analogue phones
can be had for as little as Pounds 49 and are sometimes given away free, PCN
handsets usually cost between Pounds 149 and Pounds 299 depending on the
model chosen. However, call charges tend to be lower for PCN than for GSM.
Handset prices are not likely to remain high for long. Diana Jones of
service provider Mercury Communications Mobile Services, says: 'By
Christmas, GSM handsets should be the same price as high-quality analogue
phones - ranging from Pounds 99 to Pounds 299.'
One way of getting a cheaper GSM handset before then is to shop around in
Europe. Charges for phones vary from country to country, and depending on
whether they are bought with or without airtime. So it is worth comparing
prices.
But if you plan to use your GSM phone outside the national network you
register with, beware of the huge mark-ups on cross-border calls.
These can add an extra 30-45 per cent to GSM call charges, according to
Bryan Van Dussen, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group Europe.
Despite high call charges when abroad and patchy coverage in some countries,
most early customers feel they get value for money in terms of convenience
and savings on hotel phone bills.
Of course, high handset and call charges do not worry Hollywood mobile
users. As well as hijacking a car before giving chase, they now take the
mobile too.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (10): Documents not yet
dead - Printer sales show a continued appetite for paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paper prices may be rising, business, but our appetite for documentation is
apparently insatiable. Multimedia communications and electronic data storage
may be growth markets, but the paperless office is clearly as far away as
ever.
Almost 9m printers were sold in Europe in 1993, an increase of 8 per cent on
the year, according to Matthew Checkley, printer market analyst at market
research company BIS Strategic Decisions. Some 4m of those units were inkjet
printers (most designed for personal use), 1.5m more than in 1992.
The survival of a mass dot matrix market appears doomed. Just under 3m dot
matrix printers were shipped in 1993, 1.3m fewer than in 1992. Indeed, Mr
Checkley forecasts that by 1998, the dot matrix market will be reduced to a
niche sector with just 5 per cent of total printer sales - for applications
such as high volume multi-part stationery.
But while the Star Micronics factory in Wrexham has collapsed under the
strain, other dot matrix suppliers are optimistic.
Rod Saar, managing director at Mannesmann Tally believes dot matrix will
still represent 20 per cent of the total printer market by 1998.
Eddie Huggins, director of marketing at Citizen, agrees, claiming sales of
the ABC Colour dot matrix printer, at 30 per cent above market expectations,
proves that it is still a viable technology in the SoHo (small office/home
office) market where an occasional colour capability at low cost is a bonus.
However, inkjet is clearly the technology for the masses. According to
Romtec, the total UK printer market in 1993 was worth Pounds 740m of which
inkjet printers commanded a 23.6 per cent share by value, 36 per cent by
units. Of that market, Canon claimed a 41 per cent share in value, 52 per
cent by units.
All four manufacturers of core inkjet technology (Canon, Epson, Hewlett
Packard and, more recently, Olivetti), hope to benefit from the trend
towards colour capable inkjet printing, with Mr Checkley of BIS projecting
sales of 6m such units per year by 1998.
The potential revenues appeal to Amstrad. Just three years after saying that
there was no money in computer peripherals and the only thing to do with
existing stocks was to 'throw them in the River Thames', Amstrad boss Alan
Sugar announced a collaborative agreement with Jarfalla ICC, ABB, a
manufacturer part owned by IBM, to produce a 'a landmark' product in
compact, low cost, high quality inkjet printer technology.
Both Mr Checkley of BIS and Graham Salmons of Printer Europe, Dataquest
point to the rise in the sales of laser/LED printer as an indication that
the days of mono (black only) inkjet are numbered.
More than 1m laser/LED printers were sold during 1993 and volumes are
expected to increase significantly over the next year or two with the advent
of Windows GDI (Graphical Device Interface) laser printers, such as the
Mannesmann Tally T-Win.
The advantages of GDI technology are that it is easier to use, has faster
PC-to-print processing speeds and truer WYSIWYP (What you See is What You
Printer). It also avoids the need for a complex built-in printer control
language and a control panel; hence the low prices.
NEC was the first to introduce a GDI printer and it now hopes to set the
printer world alight with the second generation series of SuperScript
printers bringing GDI advantages to network applications. NEC is not alone,
with others, including Brother, hard on its heels.
The frenetic activity in the low end personal page printer market could
affect the positions of the market leaders. For now though, according to BIS
Strategic Decisions, Hewlett Packard continues to dominate this sector with
a 51 per cent share (up from 39 per cent in 1992), its nearest rival being
Oki with 7 per cent (up from 6 per cent in 1992).
A long-promised Microsoft at Work concept, it is said, will provide users
with a common graphical interface for click-on access to any function
including copying and fax.
Although there are about 75 companies involved, the only evidence of
developments to date is the Lexmark WinWriter 600 (DPI) launched earlier
this year. With no competitors to help drive the market, it could be
something of a hollow victory, although 1995 might change all that.
Development activity in the networked printer market is just as heady; and
no wonder. According to Dataquest, by 1997 more than 70 per cent of European
PCs will be connected to Lans, resulting in a tripling of network printers
within the next five years.
Canon, which has produced 10m laser beam print engines (70 per cent of the
total) in the past 10 years, is targeting small groups with the LPB-4i, a 4
ppm Windows printer priced at the same level as a high specification inkjet.
The price per user is almost at dot matrix levels.
As individuals increasingly run different applications simultaneously,
network printers from suppliers such as Mannesmann Tally, Oce-Printing
Systems and QMS have been obliged to introduce state-of-the-art simultaneous
processing of multiple jobs.
At the high volume end of the market, industry analysts such as the
GartnerGroup, point to the advantageous features of IBM's strategic
architecture (AFP).
Information from any source in any form - plain text, graphics, images, bar
codes or forms with small print - can be printed out on any printer.
Rank Xerox meanwhile has launched a range of network printers featuring
intuitive software, called Document Services for Printing. As well as
allowing systems administrators to track usage and generate charge-backs and
accounting reports for specific departments, it enables users to search the
network for the printer that best suits the needs of the job at the time.
The advance of colour printing in the general office is also gathering pace,
with thermal transfer technology the main contender.
Several product launches over the past few weeks, plus some aggressive price
reductions of anything up to 50 per cent on existing machines, show that
manufacturers such as Kodak, Mitsubishi and Tektronix believe it is a market
worth fighting for.
But most industry analysts look to laser as the colour technology of the
future. BIS Strategic Decisions forecast this sector will grow much faster
than colour copiers, with unit sales rising from 130 units in 1992 to 32,500
in 1997.
It could be higher if the QMS ColourScript Laser 1000 and the Oce 6460
desktop machines are joined by lower cost units from other suppliers.
In September, two months after launching the 4900 colour laser printer, Rank
Xerox was predicting that sales would be 50 per cent ahead of target by the
end of the year, with distributors already ordering over and above original
schedules.
The market should be in full swing next year when Hewlett Packard launches
its Colour LaserJet in the UK. Already available in the US and Canada, it is
interesting to note the use of a Konica colour laser engine.
Nicky Ayres, responsible for network printer marketing at Hewlett Packard in
the UK, said that the engine has 'excellent colour registration with
one-pass (higher speed) printing'.
Such developments mean that 1995 could become an even more interesting year
for the printer industry than 1994

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (9): Faster fax
transmission helps cut the telephone bill - A few seconds makes all the
difference
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One might wonder why it matters if a fax machine transmits a page of text in
two seconds instead of 11. After all, the seven seconds makes little
difference to most people.
But fax machine vendors believe that speed is important, even if most of
their customers do not realise it. Super-fast fax machines, transmitting a
page of A4 in just that amount of time are expected next year from
manufacturers such as NEC.
With prices predicted to be about Pounds 3,000, they will be competitive
against today's heavy-duty, top-of-the range machines.
The real benefit lies in the potential for savings on telecommunications
costs. The two-second transmission time means that three to five pages can
be transmitted in the same time as one today. Most installed fax machines
transmit at 9.6 kilobits per second, averaging 9-11 seconds per page. The
fastest machines transmit at 14.4 kilobits per second, which average six
seconds per page.
Businesses which regularly use fax for long documents such as contracts,
will notice a large reduction in the overall transmission times. If they are
paying high international call charges, that reduction should translate into
a lower telephone bill.
The new machines will conform to the Group 3 technical standard for fax  -
the most common type of fax machine used by businesses today. They will
operate over ISDN lines at 64 kilobits per second.
Similar transmission times are already possible on digital fax machines  -
available from manufacturers such as Canon and Ricoh. Digital fax, also
known as Group 4 fax, has been available for several years.
But it has not proved popular, with less than 1,000 sales a year throughout
Europe, according to figures from the industry consultancy BIS Strategic
Decisions.
The reason is not that users doubt the benefit of the higher speed. It has
more to do with technical standards. Group 4 is incompatible with the
analogue Group 3 faxes. This means that it can only transmit to another
Group 4 machine.
Usually, Group 4 machines are sold in pairs, for a specific purpose. For
example, a law firm with offices in the US and UK.
Ricoh's Chris Wills says the cost can be justified by comparing the cost of
a 1.5-second transmission time with the Group 3 average of 11-15 seconds at
international call rates. 'You can work out a payback in months rather than
years,' Mr Wills explains.
But BIS consultant Bruce Clements, believes the super-fast Group 3 machines
will be a better option than Group 4 because they can talk to any Group 3
fax - they adjust the transmission speed where there is a slower fax at the
other end.
He points out that 1.9m fax machines were sold in western Europe in 1993.
'It is a question of the installed base. The whole point of fax is that you
can talk to someone else,' said Mr Clements.
But speed is not the only area of change for fax technology. Next year's fax
machines will look different, and in many cases will do much more than
faxing. Ricoh's IFS 66, which is now under development, will incorporate
PC-fax and electronic mail facilities. It will also function as a printer
and a document scanner.
The new 'intelligent fax' will allow people to receive faxed information,
add to it and then send it on to someone else as electronic mail. It will
also hold individual phone books for people, which will be able to store
regular fax destinations.
Programming numbers into the machine will be made easier using the new touch
screen controls - a graphic user interface with computer-style screen icons.
To send to regular destinations, people will access their phone book,
highlight the number and send.
The product derives from a development led by software company Microsoft.
Called Microsoft At Work, it aims to produce a common means for connecting
disparate pieces of office equipment, including printers, scanners and
copiers as well as fax machines. Today, all products are proprietary and
linking them together is difficult. Other fax manufacturers working with
Microsoft include NEC, Canon, and Oki.
The At Work interface will mean that fax machines can be attached to local
area networks, and use them to control incoming and outgoing communications.
It should also be possible to use fax machines as linking equipment between
two different local area networks such as Banyan Vines and Novell Netware.
At Work products will become an alternative to the PC-fax and Lan-fax
packages currently available, such as Delrina Winfax and Gamma Fax.
Some industry observers question the need for At Work when these other
products already exist. But At Work proponents claim that many businesses
are familiar with fax, but have difficulty understanding computer
communications. Providing them with a means of linking the fax machine to a
computer network, is a more acceptable solution, they say.
Paul Gibson, sales director at Oki Systems said 'techno-fear' stops many
businesses from buying PC-fax products. The At Work products provide 'the
best of both worlds. And you don't need to know how it works', he said.
Oki has a forerunner product to the At Work concept, which integrates fax
with a printing and copying functions under the control of a PC, for just
below Pounds 3,000.
Ricoh's Chris Jobling points out that the At Work concept more closely
integrates the computer system with the fax, than the traditional PC-fax
products. The At Work concept incorporates the stand-alone fax, with the
PC-fax, the Email, the printer and the scanner, he says. To get the same
functionality without it, would mean exiting one application and going into
another. The operation would not be as smooth.
NEC's forthcoming Nefax-MFD, also based on the At Work interface, will
enable the fax machine to be used as an optical filing system, by attaching
an optical disk drive.
It will also have extra security via an electronic signature. The signature
effectively seals a document so that it cannot be tampered with. It can also
be used to generate an audit trail, showing where the fax had been and who
had looked at it.
The At Work project is also expected to design a standard screen interface
for faxes and other equipment. Screen-based fax controls should mean that
the machines are easier to use than today's unfriendly machines which
provide no guidance.
However, industry observers warn that At Work concept has yet to be proven.
'Just because you develop something, doesn't mean that it will be taken up,'
said Lester Davis, of the British Facimile Industry Consultative Committee.
There is further concern that the development is being led by a single
software vendor. The fax industry traditionally has developed technical
standards by consultation, and by mutual agreement on a common approach.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): Looking for a super
glue - Document management lacks an umbrella system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The paperless office has been an enticing image since the invention of word
processing a few decades ago. The promise was that it would improve
efficiency and profitability by doing away with document duplication, lost
invoices and desktop paper mountains.
But most of business information is still on paper.
'At least 80 per cent of information is in paper form and that's not going
to change in a hurry,' says Andrea Wharton, research director of Wharton
Information Systems in the UK. 'Computers might communicate with each other,
the buffs are communicating on the Internet, but for the majority of us,
we'll still be using paper for at least another five years.'
The human attachment to paper is only partly to blame. For many small
companies, it may not yet be worth the relatively high cost of investment in
document imaging systems, and for larger organisations, the move from paper
is still a 'big conceptual leap', says Ms Wharton.
But the move away from paper has started and it is speeding up. The
financial services sector continues to be the biggest user of document
management systems, followed by the oil and chemicals sector and government
bodies. Electronic document processing and management is one of the
fastest-growing sectors in office automation.
In its latest survey of buying intentions*, International Data Corporation,
the US information technology analyst, predicts that more than a third of
companies and organisations will buy document management systems this year.
The survey, of 300 US-based companies and organisations, indicates that
government bodies are catching up with the financial sector as the biggest
buyers. And while companies are becoming more demanding as the industry
matures, more than 60 per cent of current users say that logging paper in
and out of their document management systems is already saving them time. In
a UK survey** by Wharton information Systems, more than two-thirds of
current users said they planned more spending in the coming year.
But while there is a wide choice of software for specific applications, such
as accounting and loans procedures, the big gap in the market, according to
the Wharton report, is in comprehensive systems that can be used across
organisations regardless of the type of information or where it is stored.
'At the heart of future systems there will have to be a product that can
track and manage all the files in an organisation, no matter where they
reside and no matter what data type they are - voice messages, images, text
files, data file.' In addition, users will need the 'most flexible type of
retrieval possible'. At the moment, organisations are 'using bits of the
ultimate solution, usually the bits that they perceive as having the most
immediate impact on their organisation'.
The report predicts that by the middle of this decade, the point will have
been reached where the disparate elements of document management will have
to be brought together in an umbrella system. 'It is unlikely that any
single organisation will be able to provide that umbrella system plus all of
the elements that operate underneath it. If modern networking systems such
as Novell Netware can be viewed as a sort of organisational glue . . . then
what we are looking for in document management terms is a super glue.'
Organisations currently moving towards providing such a glue include
Interleaf, Saros, Soft Solutions and Excalibur, whose pattern recognition
technology is already being used by other vendors as a building block into
their own systems.
Both the Wharton and IDC studies point to trends already under way that
could lead towards a unified solution, helping buyers to find products that
will easily integrate with their existing systems and that will look after
all their processing needs. IDC says alliances are being formed that will
create standards to make document management possible across disparate
systems.
'The first of these efforts is the Shamrock consortium, initiated by Saros
and IBM, and joined by document managers, user corporations and
infrastructure vendors such as Microsoft, Interleaf, Hewlett-Packard, Adobe
and Frame.' The Wharton report, however, cautions that Shamrock, while
seeking an umbrella system, also intends to preclude development of
incompatible and counter-productive systems.
'While we . . . applaud any action that helps to set standards . . . we are
rather more concerned about the idea of working to 'preclude incompatible
and counter-productive' standards,' says the report. 'Who is to be the
arbiter?' Such statements, it adds 'are more than a little worrying,
especially when such large organisations . . . as IBM, Hewlett-Packard and
Microsoft are members of the coalition'.
The Shamrock alliance has promised to produce integrated architecture that
will bring together enterprise library services, document communication and
generation with business process applications. A first version of the full
system is due to be unveiled early next year.
In the meantime, choosing a document management system continues to be
difficult, especially for smaller companies that cannot afford to employ
specialists. Even for large organisations, the choice can be hit and miss,
particularly at a point in the industry's development when the central
component for successful document management may be still missing.
In the UK, according to the Wharton report, Keyfile led the market last year
among suppliers of software packages, most of which are Dos-based.
Canofile still dominates in turnkey systems costing less than Pounds 50,000,
according to Wharton, which identifies no clear leader among vendors of
client/server systems costing more than Pounds 50,000, with the market
shared by Filenet, Olivetti, Wang, ICL and Trimco. Cimage, Intergraph and
Trimco, lead in large format systems, which the industry is targeting the
oil and utilities markets.
Advice on buying new systems can be sought from industry bodies, such as the
UK Association of Information and Image Management (UK Aim). There are also
specialist books on the market such as the Document Management Yearbook,
along with a raft of specialist magazines.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Nearing a digital
era - Manufacturers have added a number of new features to photocopiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Long past its forecast sell by date, the analogue photocopier market is
alive and well and still growing, albeit at a more modest rate than in
previous years.
According to Jacqueline Hendriks, document management industry analyst at
Dataquest, the market increased by about 7 per cent in 1993, with 1.15m
photocopiers shipped in western Europe and the UK accounting for 135,400
unit placements.
However, while manufacturers are still investing heavily in the technology,
with the main R&amp;D focus being on higher reliability and productivity with
greater ease of use, the industry is working steadily, if quietly and
cautiously, towards the digital era.
Oce van der Grinten, Europe's one remaining indigenous copier manufacturer
acclaimed for its 'clean and green' high volume analogue machines, has
intimated that 1996 will mark the end of the line for further development of
analogue machines, with all R&amp;D investment from then being devoted to
digital technology.
It is not as bold a step as it may sound. As part of a European office
automation initiative in the 1980s, Oce hosted the first ever demonstration
of digital copier-printer technology with connectivity support across
multiple computer platforms.
But the investment required to turn it into a commercial product line was
not sustainable, so the developments were put on the back burner to await a
more digitally aware marketplace.
Developments across the copier industry over the past few years should make
the copier-based printer (as distinct from the printer that has a multiple
copy function) the preferred choice for organisations looking for a directly
connected output device that can produce multiple documents sets, in colour
or black and white, finished ready for distribution.
State-of-the art attributes that should appeal to the computer print world
include:
Multiple copy speeds of up to 100 pages per minute;
100 per cent operation at full rated engine speed for every process,
including double-sided copying, from image input to sorting and stapling;
Robust paper feeding systems that minimise the risk of paper jams;
Longer lasting components that are more environmental friendly; and
Graphical displays with touch-screen controls.
Epitomising the latest trends, the Minolta CS Pro (Customer Satisfaction
through increased Productivity) Series is claimed to be 250 per cent more
reliable than existing machines, with a CPU Watchdog facility which monitors
each operation (feeding, duplex, sorting, stapling).
If a fault develops, the function concerned is isolated so that other copier
functions can continue to be used as normal.
Higher productivity innovations include:
More logical left to right feeding of originals and two-way remote
diagnostics facility (Minolta);
A zoom area indicator which tells the user which area of the original will
be copied, plus a new print engine which only requires servicing once every
100,000 copies (Toshiba); and
An I-ADF (inverting automatic document feeder) which automatically counts,
feeds, copies and returns up to 50 originals in order (Panasonic).
Developments from Ricoh include an auto tandem paper tray with automatic
switching for continuous operation; a dual feeder which allows one job to be
started as another is being completed; a 360,000-copy organic drum; and auto
sensing of operator presence which automatically activates the touch-screen
LCD control panel.
At Sharp, the main focus is on high volume copying with an innovative vacuum
paper feed system which lifts and separates each sheet of copy paper for
trouble-free operation; while at Konica a low-volume copier has a clam-shell
design which opens from the back rather than the side to give service
engineers easier access, plus cross-range compliance with the more stringent
Blue Angel II environmental standards.
Most manufacturers with digital products in the wings, including Infotec,
Konica, Lanier, Minolta and Ricoh, say that the bid for a share of the
copier-printer market will begin in earnest in 1995. The only question is,
how digital will be the products.
Clever tricks offering advanced image manipulation such as 999 per cent zoom
reduction and enlargement may be a talking point, but they are hardly
practical features likely to win over users on a general office computer
network.
More useful is easy access to the document production facilities and
transparent connectivity with good software.
'Digital copiers like the AR-5040 will challenge the way companies think
about the role of the copier in the document production process,' says David
Naylor, general manager for copiers and fax at Sharp UK.
'Features such as duplex (double sided) scanning, mailmerge, anamorphic zoom
and even booklet production, combined with a SCSI interface, will bring a
new level of document finishing at the workgroup level previously only
available on much large, high volume copiers'.
Industry analysts such as Jacqueline Hendriks of Dataquest point to the
Canon GP55 which can now be delivered with a computer interface that turns
it from an expensive copier into a high-speed (30 pages per minute) network
laser printer/copier complete with A3, duplex, sorting and stapling
capabilities.
Unlike commercial concerns, educational establishments have already embraced
the concept of the digital copyprinter, in the form of the upgradeable
electronic duplicator from suppliers such as Alcatel, Gestetner, Infotec,
Ricoh and Riso.
Offering speeds up to 130 copies per minute, a high 400 DPI resolution and
cost per copy of less then 1p in multi-copy mode, 40 per cent of purchasers
say the cost-justification of paying a higher price for a copying facility
was the ability to upgrade it to digital copier-printer at a later date to
allow direct input from a personal computer.
The future of digital colour copying for general office applications is not
quite so certain, however.
Buyers know that access to such a facility would enable them to produce more
eye-catching presentations and improve their chances of winning new
business, but the catalyst of change is usually cost savings.
Nevertheless, the 1994 Kodak Office Imaging survey found that more than a
quarter of organisations in the UK use spot colour for 10-30 per cent of
document colour compared with just 6 per cent a year ago. Moreover, 50 per
cent of companies reported that 10 per cent of their total document output
was colour compared with one in 10 companies in 1993.
Yet, according to Roger Riseley of InfoQuest, a new market research
organisation, just 1,300 colour units were sold last year, with only the
Canon CLC 10 selling in anything like 'real numbers, though far less than in
1992'. Partly responsible for the decline, he suggests, was the arrival of
the Xerox Majestik which 'was beginning to walk away with the colour market
towards the end of 1993'.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (6): Lower production cuts the stockpile
 -Richard Mooney discusses the importance to aluminium of the London Metal
Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium has clearly been the London Metal Exchange's outstanding performer
this year.
At 49 per cent, its price rise since the end of 1993 beats copper into
second place by 13 percentage points; and while it still has to play second
fiddle to that contract in terms of turnover, it has narrowed the gap
appreciably with a 48.5 per cent rise to 10.67m lots in the
January-September period, compared with copper's 11.5 per cent rise to 12.2m
lots.
A less welcome distinction is aluminium's continuing unassailable lead in
the LME warehouse stocks league. Although down by 460,000 tonnes from June's
all-time high, the total, at 2.19m tonnes, is still nearly double that for
zinc, which is itself well clear of lead and copper in the minor placings.
That the size of the stockpile has been a millstone around the neck of the
aluminium market as it has striven to lead the base-metals sector out of
recession is beyond doubt. But it has become a less onerous burden of late,
as concerted efforts by aluminium producers around the world to reduce
excess production have led to a quickening drawdown from this overhanging
reserve of metal.
From the LME's point of view, moreover, the size of the stockpile pays a
compliment to the success of the aluminium contract since its launch in
1978.
'The LME is now performing, with great ease and enthusiasm, the inventory
financing job that was once done for consumers and producers by their own
individual banks,' Mr Ted Arnold, Metals Analyst at Merrill Lynch, told a
Metal Bulletin-sponsored conference in London this year. He said it was
estimated that between 55 and 60 per cent of surplus aluminium stocks in the
western world were now held on the LME, compared with only 14 per cent 12
years ago.
Facilitating this development, Mr Arnold said, had been a change in the
LME's membership structure. There were now far more banks and
financial-services institutions, which had 'easy access to large amounts of
money'.
He quoted a survey produced by Alan Heap, of County NatWest Securities
Australia, which showed that up to 80 per cent of all LME stocks were now
held by financial institutions, rather than by 'traditional' users of the
physical market, such as producers, merchants and consumers.
But the development of a highly liquid LME aluminium contract has also
altered the commercial behaviour of some producers of the metal, suggests
Alcan Aluminum. In a recent issue of Compass, its house journal, the
Canadian producer said that before they had the LME as a 'buyer of last
resort' producers world-wide had been 'quicker to adjust their production to
market needs.
'But today, things are quite different. New types of producers have entered
the market over the past ten years - if they can't find clients for their
metal, they simply sell it to the LME and receive cash.'
Alcan also noted that it was mainly speculators who owned the aluminium in
LME warehouses. 'These investors have nothing to do with the aluminium
industry,' it pointed out. 'For them, buying and selling aluminium is
strictly an investment decision.'
Alcan is not alone in warning of the impact of the new breed of investors
involved in LME trading. Buying by investment funds and banks had increased
metal prices, and the volumes traded and sometimes caused prices to
anticipate improvements in the fundamental supply-demand balances, County
NatWest's Alan Heap told an LME seminar during London Metals Week earlier
this month. But 'later in the cycle short selling by non-trade players may
push prices lower than many market watchers would expect'.
The threat was not immediate, however. Banks held metal in LME warehouses as
collateral against loans, and also as a revenue-earning investment - so it
was not available for immediate delivery. About half the LME stockpile was
tied up as collateral, Mr Heap estimated.
This 'financialisation' of LME stocks was part of the explanation as to how
'physical tightness' could drive aluminium prices higher at a time of
'statistical surplus', according to US industry analyst Stewart Spector. In
addition, there were 'logistical problems' limiting how quickly metal not
tied up in financing programmes could be shipped from the LME warehouses
around the world, Mr Spector pointed out in the latest issue of his Monthly
Aluminium Statistical Review.
All this suggests that, while the market effect of the LME stockpile is not
so heavy as it may at first appear, it is likely to last longer than
producers would hope. At Rotterdam, where the amount of LME aluminium ingot
awaiting shipment was estimated at 400,000 tonnes, and rising 'almost
daily', port facilities were capable of loading no more than 60,000 tonnes a
week and more probably somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes, said the
Spector review. 'At that rate, it could take well into 1995 to empty
Rotterdam warehouses.'
LME dominance of the world aluminium market could be facing a challenge
soon, but not so soon as had been expected.
The newly-merged New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) and New York Commodity
Exchange (Comex) had planned to have a new aluminium contract up and running
early in 1995, but Nymex chairman Daniel Rappaport admitted recently that
that target was 'overly optimistic'. 'But there is still a chance for the
end of 1995,' he added.
One problem, he said, was designing a contract with specifications that met
the market's needs. Another was properly integrating it with the LME's
established contract.
'The Comex and LME contracts now feed on each other,' Mr Rappaport told the
Reuters news agency, adding that Nymex's aim would be to create a similar
'symbiosis' with the aluminium contract.
He noted that LME chairman Raj Bagri had told him that there was not room
for two aluminium contracts. 'But he invited us to find that out for
ourselves,' the Nymex chief added.
One leading US producer, Kaiser Aluminum Corporation, seems to agree with Mr
Bagri. 'Right now the LME has many delivery locations in the US, and it
seems to be working efficiently,' said a company executive earlier this
year. 'I don't see the need for another contract to get our business done.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (7): As value rises, so does theft / A
look at other recent developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The downside to aluminium's high value and recyclability is that it is all
too frequently the target for thieves.
When prices rise, aluminium beer barrels, road signs and bridge rails -
often cut through by power saws - disappear at a growing rate.
This represents a real loss for the industry, because these products are
usually made from high-quality alloys which would normally be recycled as
such. But, after thieves have melted down these products, the alloy is not
immediately recognisable, and the metal is sold as the lowest-priced scrap.
More important, customers - particularly local authorities - are forced to
consider giving up using aluminium and changing to less-tempting materials,
even if those materials do not perform as well as aluminium.
WAYS TO RECYCLE FOIL
Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in electrical
engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium automotive
castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal.
The industry is now turning its attention to recycling aluminium foil - a
tricky business, because a great deal of bulk has to be collected to get any
reasonable weight, and 90 per cent of foil is meant to be in contact with
food which creates hygiene problems.
In the US, Reynolds Metals, the second-largest aluminium group, began
testing foil recycling in 1991. Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' president,
admits that it is not as commercially necessary for the industry to recycle
foil as beverage cans - in the US only 200m lbs (90,700 tonnes) of aluminium
is used annually for consumer foil, plus a similar quantity for food and
other containers, compared with 4bn lbs (1.8m tonnes) used for cans.
'But recycling helps to identify foil as a green product,' he points out.
'It gives foil an edge over plastics.'
In the UK, nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including
beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil
packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year.
To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign
(AFRC) was started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater Foil and
Paper Products, and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium Foil
Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer Products.
AFRC spent Pounds 200,000 over two years on five pilot schemes, from which
it became obvious that foil would not be collected successfully by local
authorities working alone, without help from the industry. So the industry
has drawn up a 10-year plan which will establish national infrastructure and
work towards a 30 per cent recycling target.
Typically, schemes provide local authority 'foil bank' systems serviced by a
single local charity or group of charities. Banks are located on supermarket
or other prime sites. AFRC says the involvement of a local charity provides
motivation for the public to give for their own community - clean foil can
fetch Pounds 350 a tonne. Schools are also be involved in the collection
schemes. The scheme is funded by a voluntary levy of Pounds 10 a tonne from
the rolling mills.
EDUCATING INDUSTRY
Aluminium is a relative newcomer compared with other metals, and
manufacturing industry in general remains woefully ignorant about its uses.
The European aluminium industry is intends to rectify this with a Dollars
1.5m (Pounds 1m) project aimed at educational institutions and industries
that use the metal.
Under a European Commission programme known as Comett II, aluminium
industries in nine EC and European Free Trade Association countries and 25
universities are setting out to put aluminium on the educational map.
The EC is providing about one third of the Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) cost,
while the universities are contributing their time. The industry is footing
the rest of the bill, mainly through the UK's Aluminium Federation,
Germany's Aluminium-Zentrale and SkanAluminium in the Nordic countries.
The Aluminium Training Partnership (ATP) provides the link between the
industry and the universities.
The second, and most important project, is known as Talat, an acronym for
Training for Aluminium Application Technologies.
Its objective is to produce 150 hours of teaching material covering a broad
range of engineering disciplines: material property information on
engineering alloys and products; design and calculation of aluminium alloy
structures; manufacturing of products; joining techniques and surface
technology.
For each subject, one or more groups of university partners have been
formed, each with specialist contacts in the industry. They aim to produce
lectures suitable for courses in nearly all the relevant areas of technical
education.
In the UK, the Department of Trade and Industry has promised Pounds 132,000
over three years, if the industry will match that pound for pound, for
teaching material such as lecture notes and formatted computer disks.
GENCOR'S ACT OF FAITH
No company has more faith in the future of aluminium than Gencor, the South
African resources group, which in July paid Dollars 1.1bn for most of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group's mining and minerals assets. These operate mainly
under the Billiton banner.
About 60 per cent of Billiton's revenues come from its interests in bauxite
and alumina, the raw material and intermediate product needed for aluminium
production. These interests are located in Australia, where Billiton has 30
per cent of the big Worsley deposit, Brazil and Ireland.
Gencor also has a 41 per cent interest in Alusaf, the South African
aluminium producer that is completing a Dollars 2bn expansion to increase
its annual capacity to 646,000 tonnes, a size not seen outside Russia
before.
Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, points out that a combination of
Alusaf and the Billiton upstream bauxite and alumina operations would
produce the fifth-largest integrated aluminium business in the world. Gencor
has in mind floating Billiton or part of the aluminium assets on a stock
exchange at some stage.
Mr Gilbertson admits that when aluminium prices are low the Billiton deal
has little appeal. However, 'at high prices the returns are huge. If our
estimate of the medium-term (aluminium) price trends are anywhere near
correct, then this parcel of assets will prove to be very valuable and the
price we have paid to have been cheap.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): Systems fuel demand
for space / A look at the fast growing market for electronic data storage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Documents can be stored in a heap on the desk, in a filing cabinet or in a
buff folder, but they can get buried or go missing. It takes time to
retrieve data from cabinets and they take up space.
A square inch of magnetic disk space can accommodate as much information as
20 filing cabinets or more. But despite a rise in the use of electronic
storage methods, less than 5 per cent of the world's business information is
stored 'on line' in a computer. 'The rest is on microfilm, microfiche and
plain old paper,' says Paul Wolfstaetter, research analyst with the US
Gartner group.
The demand for electronic storage is growing rapidly - at a rate of 40-50
per cent a year and this is expected to continue. The UK data storage market
alone is likely to be worth more than Dollars 400m this year, rising to
about Dollars 700m by 1997, according to Dataquest, the research group.
Demand is being fuelled by the greater use of computer-based office systems,
the onset of multimedia applications, networks linking computers to
telephone lines and an increasing use of software programs that eat up
storage space.
'Only a few years ago, a 20 megabyte hard disk would have been enough for
most people's needs,' says Trevor Duplock of Micropolis, the US disk drive
manufacturer. 'Today, with the availability of software such as Windows NT
which requires 100Mb of disk space, the typical user needs much more space.'
The market's voracious appetite is forcing average disk and disk drive
capacities ever upwards. According to a recent study* by Disk Trend Report,
the US analyst, demand for 100-200 megabyte disk drives, which led the
market in 1993, will plummet by 50 per cent this year in favour of 200-300m
megabyte drives.
By 1995, 300-500Mb drives will lead the market. The study expects growth in
sales of hard disk drives for personal computers, workstations and network
file servers to boost global revenues to about Dollars 33bn by 1997.
Manufacturers, meanwhile, are responding by providing smaller disks with
ever-increasing capacities.
But as demand rises, the price per megabyte of storage is expected to
continue to fall and storage options to increase.
The way an organisation chooses to store data depends on four main factors.
How much information needs to be stored; how quickly access is needed;
whether the data needs to be processed; and the cost per byte of
information.
There are two main options. Magnetic disks dominate the storage market
because they are rewritable, while optical disks are usually not.
Magneto-optical disks, which form only a tiny portion of the market, are
rewritable, but the cost of equipment is relatively high and retrieval times
are slow - the cost per megabyte, however, is low.
Most PCs are fitted with rewritable magnetic hard disks as well as floppy
disk drives for portable data storage. A high proportion of new PCs are also
now equipped with a CD-Rom (read only memory) drive for multimedia
applications. The CD-Rom has become a popular medium for software
distribution because it is relatively cheap, easy to handle, and capable of
storing large amounts of data, voice and images.
A new generation of storage devices that adhere to PCMCIA (Personal Computer
Memory Card International Association) standards is also beginning to take
hold. These devices, often called memory cards because they are not much
bigger than a credit card, incorporate semiconductor memory chips and
provide data storage capacity approaching that of a magnetic hard disk.
Prices of PCMCIA cards are coming down as the cards become more popular and
manufacturing volumes increase. The advantage of memory cards is that they
are rugged, light weight and portable. This makes them particularly well
suited to notebook PCs and hand-held computing devices.
In the mainframe and mid-range computer arena, another acronym that is
becoming better-known in the market is Raid - redundant array of inexpensive
disks. Standard, smaller disk drives are stacked together to give the sort
of storage capacity offered by a single, more expensive drive.
Linked in an array, they take large amounts of data and access times are
relatively swift. Manufacturers, among them EMC, StorageTek, IBM and
Micropolis, say they offer greater security because the failure of one,
large disk means much more is lost than if one smaller disk in an array
fails.
At the same time, as manufacturers are fitting more data on to smaller
disks, their price is falling, making it cheaper to make back-ups to store
precious data on disks off site. 'The risk for the user is in a single,
expensive disk. If I can buy two small disks with the same dollar and each
with the same capacity, then I buy the two and use one to copy and store
it,' says Mr Wolfstaetter.
For now, magnetic hard disks will continue to dominate, says Mr
Wolfstaetter. 'Magnetic disks have almost pushed optical disks out of the
picture.' But he believes the medium of the future will be holographic
crystal.
Scientists at Stanford University have recently developed a fully automated
digital holographic data storage system with a data capacity of 163,000
bytes. 'By the turn of the decade we will have holographic recording and
we'll be looking at capacities of one terabyte (1,000 gigabytes) in a cubic
centimetre.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): Lack of discipline a
potential disaster - Control of office software needs to be returned to
computing professionals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Staff at entertainment group Polygram International must either use
Wordperfect and Lotus 1-2-3 or be denied access to company networks and even
face a reprimand.
This is the company's way of dealing with an issue which is increasingly
gaining attention as organisations seek to adjust the balance between
end-user software freedom and the central control of standards, contracts,
support and costs.
Office computing is now 'generally out of control', says Robin Bloor, head
of the research firm Butlerbloor, who has just produced a report* on
corporate strategy for office systems. He identifies some reasons.
First, traditional computing departments do not understand office computing
and are not used to supporting distributed systems. Meanwhile, business
departments often include PC enthusiasts who think they know more than they
do and interfere with attempts to introduce controls.
As business users gain budgetary and operational independence from the
computing department, control of computing resources becomes a political
issue.
A new type of conflict is therefore emerging between computing departments
and their end-users. In the past, business people complained that requests
for new software took months to be dealt with. PCs running spreadsheet
software gave them a taste of freedom but the falling cost of software
packages and growing familiarity with PCs mean they are now moving on to
buying and illegally copying software products which are not supported or
approved of by the central computing unit.
'In some offices we have seen a lack of discipline which almost beggars
belief,' Mr Bloor says. 'The horror stories include no back-up, virus
infestations, the spread of illicitly copied games, a complete lack of
training, undeclared and unaudited software development, not to mention the
purchase of non-standard hardware and software.'
Such findings support claims by the Federation Against Software Theft that
half the office software used in the UK is illegally copied. This costs jobs
in the software industry and stifles innovation by cutting development
budgets, the federation says. More than half the software piracy is by
end-users who do not realise they are doing anything wrong.
Other research suggests that lack of training means that only 5 or 10 per
cent of the facilities of office software products are exploited.
Studies of spreadsheet software users have shown that they are in fact
programmers without programming training: one survey by accountancy and
consultancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand found that 90 per cent of spreadsheets
had errors of more than 5 per cent in their results.
Action is needed because, as Mr Bloor puts it, 'the end-user is truly in the
ascendancy'. The office PC is now used for most writing and calculating;
soon it will be the standard for all data storage and communication too, he
says.
Growth of workgroup computing and of client-server systems is also
complicating both local office systems and corporate applications which
combine local and central processing and data storage.
'A major problem is that few organisations have defined sensible boundaries
and responsibilities,' Mr Bloor says. 'It requires senior management
intervention to exert control where it has been lost; it also requires the
formulation of appropriate corporate standards for both user departments and
computing departments to apply.'
He believes the computing department must concede control and ownership of
office systems to the users. 'What is needed is a partnership between users
and the computing department which allows users' enthusiasm and energy to be
capitalised on and properly channelled.'
This partnership must give software purchasing back to the centre, Mr Bloor
says. This will not only produce the biggest discounts but also ensure that
there are corporate standards, bringing savings in support and training.
The computing specialists must be allowed to instil the discipline of
software and data back-up and security in end-users and hammer home the
importance of avoiding software piracy.
If users are allowed to develop their own software, using spreadsheets or
the increasing number of apparently (but not really) simple development
products appearing on the market, the computing department must be allowed
the final say on testing and quality.
Such proposals highlight the changing nature of the computing department and
the need to rethink software support, according to Philip Virgo, head of IT
Strategy Services, who produces an annual study of skills trends. He says
companies need to review their computing department structures and
recruitment policies in the light of the 'fundamental change' in the nature
of the computing community.
Growth in the use of office software means that a new computing staff
category - that of user support - has appeared from nowhere in the past five
years.
He believes most growth in employment in computing will be in user support -
and that office software users themselves could fill these jobs.
Mr Virgo says recruitment traditionally involved taking on graduates as
technicians and promoting them to systems analysts. But today's need is
especially for business analysts and user support people.
'Secretarial and admin staff are now often in charge of routine computing in
user departments,' Mr Virgo says.
'Where computing is critical, the staff increasingly report to a user
manager with solid computing experience, typically gained from a posting to
the computer department for a systems project.'
He argues that such trends mean the demand for computing skills, especially
in user support, could be met increasingly by retraining users.
Mr Bloor agrees that office staff are becoming their own software support
specialists: he says more than 80 per cent of end-user support is done
'unofficially' by end-users who are supposed to be doing other jobs.
This work is not budgeted for. As a result, 'the cost of providing support
is out of control in many large companies'.
Mr Bloor, however, tends to feel that support should be the responsibility
of central computing professionals rather than retrained secretaries.
Whatever the finer points here, companies must either promote the
partnerships between user and computing departments that Mr Bloor talks
about or sooner or later face the 'horror stories' he uncovered. For people
will increasingly use information technology to develop their own working
environments, drawing together different pieces of software.
'Ultimately, end-users will all become developers of a kind,' he says. 'The
trouble is, the typical end-user is blissfully unaware of sensible computing
disciplines.'

On the face of it, you would not expect Mr Leslie Boyd to speak favourably
about aluminium beverage cans.
As a Scot who worked for British Steel Corporation before moving to Highveld
Steel in South Africa some 25 years ago, he would seem an unlikely advocate
of this particular form of packaging which has made a big dent in demand for
steel, at least in one market sector. Yet he speaks enthusiastically about
aluminium beverage cans 'taking over all over the world'. Steel cans can't
compete, he suggests, because the aluminium variety lend themselves much
more to recycling.
Today, Mr Boyd is a director of the Anglo American Corporation of South
Africa and chairman of its industrial group, which now has a vested interest
in the development of aluminium beverage cans in that country. Highveld's
Rheem division started up a new aluminium can plant last year, which
exceeded rated capacity almost from day one, and is expected to make a big
contribution to Highveld's earnings in 1994.
Mr Boyd already is suggesting that Anglo's next big capital investment in
South Africa might be a USDollars 1.5bn aluminium can sheet plant to provide
raw material for can-making.
Significantly, given his views on the subject, aluminium can recycling in
South Africa, which started only nine months ago, has already reached 20 per
cent - a level not yet reached in many more mature markets, and one that the
rest of the global industry finds heartening.
For, in the past 30 years, aluminium beverage cans have elbowed out the
steel variety and taken virtually 100 per cent of the US canned beers and
fizzy drinks market. The industry, dominated by a handful of large groups
operating globally, is now taking lessons learned in the US to other markets
the world over.
In the US, some 95bn cans of beer or fizzy soft drinks are consumed every
year - an aluminium can a day for every man, woman and child - and output
outstrips even the production of nails and paper clips.
Aluminium beverage can-makers exercise the same attention and precision as
do makers of the metal for an aircraft wing, using the highest-powered
computers to design containers that can withstand three times as much
pressure as there is in in a car tyre and also support 250 lbs in weight.
Careful design has enabled the industry to cut the amount of metal needed to
produce aluminium cans. Today's can weighs about 0.48 of an ounce, down from
about 0.66 of an ounce in the 1960s, yet producers expect to reduce that by
another 20 per cent.
The success of the aluminium beverage can has left the aluminium industry
with a problem: about 10 per cent of global demand for its metal comes from
one product in one country. So it is spending heavily to spread the 'gospel'
of the aluminium beverage can around the world.
To promote the use of aluminium beverage cans outside the US, the industry
leans heavily in its 'green' credentials, claiming that aluminium cans may
be recycled on a 'closed loop' system (from cans to scrap and back to cans
again in only a few weeks). The relatively high value of aluminium -
aluminium cans are worth six to 20 times more than any other used packaging
material, and are the most valuable used package found in household waste -
enables the industry to spread the word that can recycling gives collectors
a decent income.
Last year, for example, the US industry is estimated to have paid out about
Dollars 900m for used cans, money that went back into local economies to
benefit individuals, schools, churches'scout troops and other local
organisations.
However, this is not simply altruism on the industry's part - it needs this
recycled metal, because it is cheap. As much as 95 per cent of the energy
needed to produce new aluminium is saved by recycling old metal, because
aluminium 'stores' energy. This is important, because the average smelter
uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people to produce new aluminium. On
top of that, there are capital savings because a re-melting plant costs only
one-tenth as much as a smelter.
Steel producers point out that the high cost of new aluminium means it only
makes economic sense to use aluminium cans if more than 60 per cent of them
are recycled. Not many markets achieve this level. The US recycling rate of
about 66 per cent means that last year roughly 600,000 tonnes of aluminium,
worth about Dollars 900m, escaped from the system, possibly to be thrown
away.
In the US, recycling of used beverage cans (known in the jargon as UBCs) is
facilitated through more than 10,000 recycling centres. There is no shortage
of recycling infrastructure in Europe either. British Alcan in 1991 opened a
Pounds 28m remelt plant dedicated to UBCs at Warrington in the UK; and
others are operated by Granges in Sweden, VAW in Germany, Elval in Greece,
Alcan and Reynolds Metals in Italy, and Pechiney in France. Together they
have an annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes, helping to turn old beverage cans
into new ones. There are also many secondary smelters throughout Europe
remelting UBCs into new ingots for other high-quality aluminium products.
In Europe, several aluminium companies are financially backing an
organisation which promotes aluminium can recycling, Acre (Aluminium Can
Recycling Europe). Acre helped South Africa's equivalent organisation
prepare the groundwork for that country's roaring start to aluminium can
recycling.
According to Acre, Europeans worked their way through 56,050 tonnes of
aluminium beverage cans last year, up from 39,595 in 1992; and at least 29
per cent were recycled, up from 26 per cent.
Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals of the US, now one of the
world's biggest aluminium can producers, says the industry can expect growth
in the US to come by taking share from glass and plastic containers for
products other than beverages. 'Outside the US there are wonderful
opportunities,' he suggests.
Reynolds built its first aluminium can plant with local partners in Brazil
in 1988. It has been expanded three times, and a second plant is under
construction. The Brazilian company is also constructing plants in Argentina
and Chile. Mr Holder says: 'When we've finished we'll have the capacity to
make 5bn cans a year - but that's only 5 to 6 per cent of the market. So if
growth trends follow the US pattern, the market opportunities are obvious
for many years.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (5): Ford and Audi make light of
motoring - The motor industry has joined producers in voicing optimism about
the metal's future
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the world's second largest aluminium
group, let me borrow his car last month. He was prepared to do so because
the car is significantly different - it is one of the first 40 'aluminium
intensive vehicles' (AIVs) built by Ford.
This fleet is based on the Mercury/Sable range, and gives the first clear
indication that aluminium is suitable for the production of high volume,
rather than just low volume 'niche' cars.
Ford, the world's second largest automotive group, and Alcan believe they
have overcome most of the problems associated with producing aluminium cars
from an infrastructure which was set up to make them from steel.
Ford still needs to conduct extensive manufacturing trials and consumer
tests on the new AlV, and Mr Bougie's car is part of that programme. My
half-hour drive from downtown Montreal to Dorval airport and back did not
give much scope for serious testing. But back in May the AIV was given a
much more gruelling try-out when four of the cars were taken to the Saint
Eustache race track, near Montreal, to be put through their paces by some
automotive writers and professional drivers. The drivers were also provided
with equivalent steel-bodied cars - 400 lbs or 47 per cent heavier that the
AIVs - to compare performances.
After this test, Mr Jack Heebler, of Automotive News, reported: 'This car
(the AIV) handles so well it's as if it has sticky tyres to help it hold the
road. The AIV actually seems to carve through the turn without the heavy
feeling of the steel-bodied car.'
Similar favourable reviews greeted the Audi A8, the first production car to
use aluminium as its primary structural material. This was good news for
executives at the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) and at Audi who have
spent the past 12 years in a co-operative research effort, and have invested
a great deal in the project. Audi has spent about DM1bn (Dollars 650m) to
bring the new luxury AS to market, and Alcoa has spent Dollars 70m for a
plant at Soest, in Germany, where it is producing space frame components
which it also hopes to sell to other car makers.
Alcoa and Audi took a different route from Ford and Alcan. As aluminium is
initially much more expensive than steel, they believed it would be too
expensive simply to substitute aluminium components for those traditionally
made of steel. Instead, they designed a car that has many fewer individual
components and structures than are used in a steel vehicle. They developed a
space frame, a skeleton-like body structure, composed of fewer than 100
extrusions and castings, compared with as many as 300 for a stamped steel
body. Like Ford and Alcan, Alcoa and Audi had to develop new manufacturing
processes to produce these space frames, and new aluminium alloys were also
developed.
All this activity has been prompted by increasingly stringent regulations
covering both car fuel economy and emissions. This is a global trend, but is
strongest in developed markets such as the US, western Europe and Japan.
Both requirements can be met by lighter vehicles. And, as customers are
resisting any attempts to make cars much smaller, designers are focusing on
lighter materials to replace steel and plastics. Aluminium used in a typical
US car has grown from 50 lbs in the 1960s to nearly 200 lbs today. Most of
that extra aluminium has been used in components once made of steel or cast
iron.
There is still growth to come from this substitution process. Alcan's Mr
Bougie says that demand growth of about 6.6 per cent a year can be expected
for such things as castings, forgings and some aluminium sheet for cars,
from today's starting point of 4m tonnes.
However, now 'both Alcan and Alcoa have demonstrated the use of aluminium in
car structures, this gives us growth potential for another 20 years. But the
big growth does not come until after the year 2000. Aluminium structures in
high volume models do not come until 2000 to 2005.'
At present, the Audi-Alcoa technology is not economically viable for cars
produced at a rate of more than 100,000 a year. Mr Bougie points out that
Alcan's technology was from the start aimed at high-volume production of
mid-sized cars. 'It is in the mass-produced models that the real volume
market lies, a market we should see developing over the next five to ten
years.'
Mr Donald Macmillan, vice-president and general manager (automotive) for
Alcan Rolled Products, whose job puts him face to face with the US car
companies in Detroit, says the automotive groups are preparing themselves
for even tighter regulations, and that, in order to achieve those new
standards, they will need to hit higher miles per gallon figures with
high-volume, mainstream vehicles.
When a car is designed specifically to be made of aluminium, secondary
weight savings can be incorporated - a lighter body means that engines can
be smaller, braking systems do not have to be so powerful, and so on.
There are still some question-marks over the use of aluminium in cars -
questions about aluminium's reparability and its cost. A recent
Massachusetts Institute of Technology study showed that car-makers were
having to spend an extra Dollars 1.50 a car for every lb saved - not
particularly welcomed by an industry that likes pinching its pennies.
The motor industry is also worried about the volatility of aluminium prices.
Both Alcoa's chairman, Mr Paul 0'Neill, and Mr Macmillan, of Alcan, insist,
however, that 'life of car' stable prices can be offered as long as these
reflect the cost of replacing the smelters used to produce the metal.
The North American groups are not the only ones likely to share in the
potential bonanza. Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest
industrial group and Europe's biggest producer of aluminium extrusions, has
a vested interest in the success of the space-frame concept, which could be
a big user of extrusions. Hydro has been successfully co-operating on car
space-frame concepts since the mid 1980s with various groups, including
Renault in France, Porsche in Germany and Pininfarina in Italy.
Alusuisse-Lonza, of Switzerland, has a virtual monopoly in the supply of
aluminium sheet for the car industry in Europe, because it has developed and
patented an alloy that other companies prefer to use under licence rather
than develop an equivalent material.
There is still a possibility that the avalanche of new business that the
aluminium industry hopes for from the motor industry will not materialise,
and executives remain cautious about some of the more extravagant forecasts
being made. The steel and plastics producers are working hard to ensure
their car business is not further eroded. Already a lightweight cast iron
for automotive components available is available from Sintercast, a
Michigan-based, Swedish-American company.
Nevertheless, Alcan's Mr Bougie can say confidently: 'By the year 2010, the
world automotive industry could be consuming as much as three times the
aluminium it does today. The additional shipments to this market alone could
require the equivalent of the output of 30 to 40 additional world-scale
aluminium smelters, although by that time a growing part of this would come
from recycled aluminium.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Why networks need
managers - How to check software piracy and petty thefts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A City of London bank, which recently conducted an audit of its personal
computer networks, found 50 megabytes of computer memory were missing. The
problem was eventually traced to one of the technical IT staff, who had
taken four megabytes of memory out of each new machine that was purchased,
and put it into his home computer.
With the price of memory running at Pounds 80-100 per megabyte, such petty
thefts can cost the business a significant amount of money. Not to mention
the loss of capacity on the network, for which the business could also
suffer.
The bank's problem is not untypical. According to Adrian Botterill, UK
marketing director of network supplier Azlan, many businesses do not know
how much equipment is connected to their networks. Often equipment is
purchased without any plan or strategy by user departments and the IT
department is not consulted. Even in IT, PCs and PC networks tend to be
small beside the larger mainframe and mid-range systems and few people
bother to keep precise records.
'A lot of companies don't know what networks or systems they have in use.
Individual staff connect PCs to networks with such a degree of freedom that
IT departments often don't know what is happening,' says Mr Botterill.
Only now are user organisations beginning to realise that PC networks need
to be properly managed. Networks are installed to enable staff to be more
productive by improving the flow of information within a department or an
entire organisation. For example, a sales department is given access across
the network to the debtors and creditors list on the accounting system.
Sales reps then know which customers they should target for further sales,
and which are a bad risk.
These organisations not only risk loss of hardware, but could put in
jeopardy those very benefits which they want to achieve, if they fail to
look after the equipment. For example, can the network cope if everyone
wants to access a particular application at the same time? What happens if
more users are added to the network and traffic increases, causing regular
'crashes'?
'Networks are designed to cope with some failures. But you could have a lot
of invisible failures, and if you then load the network up with more data
traffic, you could go too far and hit a brick wall,' says Lee Taylor, of
specialists supplier Logical Networks.
Software is available to deal with each of these issues. But no single
product copes with the lot all at once. The products fall into two
categories: traditional network management software; and a new raft of
products designed to manage desktop applications and hardware.
The former includes Sun Net Manager, Hewlett Packard's Open View or IBM's
Netview. These have evolved since the mid-1980s, beginning as products for
managing distributed mainframe and mid-range computer systems, linked
together over wide area networks. They manage the networking hardware -
routers, bridges and multiplexers.
They also monitor the network traffic and alert the IT staff before a route
becomes overloaded so they have time to take action. For example, if a
network is running at 50 per cent capacity, but previously it was at 20 per
cent rising to 30 per cent, then it is clear that the steady increase in
traffic could pose a problem. The software should automatically sort out
such problems.
All three packages support the international standard for network
management, known as SNMP (simple network management protocol). However,
they can be expensive, especially for small networks. Logical Networks
quotes a minimum of Pounds 5,000 for Sun Net Manager, and Pounds
12,000-Pounds 20,000 for Open View.
Much less expensive are the desktop management products, such as the Norton
Administrator from Symantec at Pounds 350 for a five-user pack, rising to
Pounds 2,900 for 50 users. Lan Desk Manager, from Intel, costs Pounds 715
for a network with just one server up to Pounds 7,000 for one with 20
servers.
The Norton Administrator, for example, maintains an inventory of all PCs on
the network, including the processor power and memory of each machine.
Software upgrades and back-ups are also made easier, because the
Administator can distribute software throughout the network.
This solves a big network administration problem. Back-ups and other
'housekeeping' activities used to be done by a centralised IT department.
With the advent of PC networks, users were expected to do their own. But in
practice, few do so. Instead, IT staff spend most of their time moving
around the organisation, often troubleshooting problems that occur precisely
because housekeeping is done badly or not at all.
According to a recent study by Gartner Group, the market researchers, this
type of administrative activity can represent up to 84 per cent of the total
cost of ownership of a PC network. The initial capital investment comprises
the remaining 16 per cent.
The Administrator also deals with a relatively new problem facing
businesses: that of software piracy. A business can face litigation if found
to be using illegal copies of applications software packages. According to
Mr Taylor, it is easy to copy software, or to load up a package on to
several different machines. 'I don't believe there are many companies in the
UK which know how many copies of Microsoft Word they have,' he says.
The software industry is moving to crack down on such illegal copying. The
Federation Against Software Theft, an industry body set up specifically to
deal with the problem, has the power to demand a software audit. 'It is
easier for companies to do an audit if they have the management software in
place,' says Mr Botterill.
The Administrator, for example, checks every software application on the
hard drives, and monitors the usage of each. It tracks software licences,
and can be made to enforce licensing - for example, if 500 licences are paid
for, it can be asked to refuse to log on the 501st user who tries to access
that particular package.
But all of the desktop management products are proprietary and one package
will not work with another. A new technical standard, known as the desktop
management interface has been agreed. Most manufacturers are now
redeveloping their software to meet this standard, and products should be
available next year.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): Intel against Compaq
in bitter battle - Desktop computers / Paul Taylor tries to evaluate the
conflicting claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, the worldwide personal computer market is in turmoil with
leading PC manufacturers slashing prices to keep volumes moving ahead and a
bitter public power struggle breaking out between Intel, the world's leading
semiconductor manufacturer, and Compaq Computer, its biggest customer.
In mid-August, a new price war erupted in the US personal computer market
when International Business Machines slashed prices on many of its PC
products by up to 27 per cent. The move came in response to similar price
cuts by Compaq, the US market leader.
IBM also cut the prices of its PC network servers to less than those of
equivalent Compaq machines. Compaq is the dominant supplier of PC servers,
used to control office computer networks. This is the most profitable and
fastest growing section of the corporate PC market.
Then last month, in an unprecedented outburst, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's
president and chief executive, lashed out at Intel, accusing the US chip
maker of undermining Compaq's marketing efforts and of not giving his
company due consideration as the biggest seller of PCs in the US and Europe.
Mr Pfeiffer cited Intel's promotion of its own brand name, chip pricing
strategy, and the direct competition posed by Intel's growing PC and circuit
board manufacturing operations.
These battles are taking place against the backdrop of a market which has
been underpinned throughout the recession by the continued shift by business
customers away from mainframe computers to networks of desktop PCs and
mid-range computers (client-server systems).
According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, about 45 per cent
of PCs were connected to networks last year, and this is forecast to rise to
55 per cent this year and 77 per cent by 1997.
The impact of this trend is apparent in PC volume sales. Despite cutbacks,
budget freezes and huge numbers of bankruptcies and redundancies, the
European PC market grew by 12.5 per cent in unit terms in 1992 and by about
14 per cent in 1993, according to an Economist Intelligence Unit research
report. Projections for 1994 are that demand will continue to rise, with
unit growth increasing by a further 20 per cent.
At the same time, there has been a marked resurgence in sales by the large
brand name PC manufacturers over the past two years, reversing the trend
towards the cut-price 'clone' manufacturers apparent since the late 1980s.
The top five PC manufacturers all increased their market shares last year in
terms of worldwide shipments, according to Dataquest. In western Europe,
shipments by the top nine manufacturers rose by 7.3 percentage points to
54.4 per cent of the total market. Compaq, in particular, has achieved a
dramatic turnaround.
Several factors are responsible. First, the old established manufacturers
have hit back at cut-price clone manufacturers with competitively priced
machines of their own. Second, the growth of the local area network has
placed a premium on PC networking compatibility and on support and service.
Finally, customer buying habits for desktop computers have moved back
towards established indirect distribution channels.
Meanwhile, PC prices have continued to tumble. According to London-based
Marketline International, the average price of a PC in the UK fell by 16.8
per cent between 1991 and 1993. At the same time, the specifications
continue to rise, meaning that entry-level business computers now boast
features that were available only on top-level machines a few years ago.
Slim profit margins and shortening product cycles continue to take their
toll - there has been a steady stream of casualties on both sides of the
Atlantic. Nevertheless, volumes are such that no serious contender in the
data processing industry can afford to ignore the PC market.
Fuelling the PC price battle are sharp cuts by Intel in the prices of its
microprocessors. The US chipmaker reduced the prices of its 486 and latest
generation Pentium chips by about 40 per cent in the second quarter.
More recently, Intel has announced an advertising campaign to persuade
business customers and home consumers to buy PCs based on the Pentium chip -
sales of which have been slower than expected. This has annoyed Compaq,
which had large stocks of machines based on lower performance chips at the
end of the second quarter. Compaq sees Intel's attempts to accelerate the
pace of technological advance in the PC industry as an intrusion.
For its part, Intel is thought to be marketing Pentium chips aggressively so
as to maximise its already strong profit margins, and to outflank mounting
competition from rival chip manufacturers which threaten to eat into its 90
per cent market share of world microprocessor sales.
Among the competition, California-based Advanced Micro Devices has already
launched versions of Intel's 486 microprocessors and has promised a Pentium
clone by the end of the year. Other competitors include Nexgen, a
privately-held chip developer in which Compaq has a minority stake, and
Cyrix. Market analysts believe these companies could achieve a 20 per cent
or higher share of the PC microprocessor market over time.
Meanwhile, both Apple Computer and Motorola, the US electronics and
communications manufacturer, have launched PCs based on PowerPC
microprocessor chips, jointly developed by the two companies together with
IBM.
Its advocates claim the PowerPC microprocessor is more powerful than
competing chips from Intel, making them well suited to demanding desktop
applications such as multimedia with sound, video and graphics which are
beginning to appear in the office.
However, the new chips lack the broad software base available for
Intel-based PCs. This is one reason why IBM has delayed the launch of its
own version of the PowerPC until early next year.
Lou Gerstner, who took over as IBM chairman 18 months ago, has said that
some of IBM's customers are concerned about the rapid obsolescence of the
products they buy, and the pace of technological change. However Mr Gerstner
has also acknowledged that IBM has often been slower than its rivals to
bring new products to market - even when it has a technological lead.
Despite the concerns of both Compaq and IBM, it seems unlikely that the pace
of technical innovation will slow. Therefore one of the main challenges
facing corporate PC customers will continue to be to sift through the
competing claims.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (4): Tumbling prices
ignite market / A look at the rapid growth of the portable computer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lightweight 'notebook' personal computers and modem communications devices
have made portable computing a reality for a growing number of mobile
professionals in the past five years.
Advances in semiconductor technology and the miniaturisation of other
components such as hard disc storage devices have enabled PC manufacturers
to pack most of the functions of a desktop PC into an A4-sized notebook
package weighing about 6lb and priced at Pounds 1,500 or less.
Colour notebook PCs using 'dual scan' technology have become more affordable
and easier to use. Most machines are now powered by fast Intel 486
processors, have large 200Mb or bigger hard disks and credit-card sized
PCMICA expansion slots for peripherals such as fax-modems.
Battery life has been extended through the use of low-power chips,
power-saving features and improved battery technology. For example, Dell
Computer's new Latitude range includes a dual Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
battery option which extends battery life to a maximum 17.5 hours.
Other manufacturers have developed machines for niche applications. For
example, Toshiba offers a model that includes a CD-Rom drive, stereo
speakers, detachable keyboard and facilities to make multimedia
presentations while travelling and Cannon has machines which incorporate a
bubble jet printer for those who require paper print-outs but do not want to
carry a separate printer.
Fujitsu is one of several manufacturers which have launched lightweight
'tablet' PCs where data is input on to a flat screen using an electronic pen
pointing device instead of a keyboard. Fujitsu's Stylistic 500, launched
earlier this month, weighs 2.6lb and is designed to appeal to markets such
as insurance, transportation, utilities, consumer packaged goods,
pharmaceuticals and health care.
For engineers and others requiring the power of a workstation while away
from the office, Tadpole Technology has developed a range of high
performance SPARCbook 3 laptop-size portables. Target applications and
markets include computer-aided design, financial services, geographic
information systems, equipment test and maintenance and telecommunications.
Other machines have a modular design, enabling screens and hard discs to be
swapped easily and some, such as AST's range of Ascentia 900, can be easily
hooked up to larger screens or office local area networks using a docking
station or port replicators.
Technical improvements, together with tumbling prices, have turned portable
computers into the fastest-growing segment of the world computer market.
According to Dataquest, the market research organisation, portable computer
sales - mostly of notebook or even smaller sub-notebook machines - were
worth Dollars 3.6bn last year.
In volume terms notebook computer sales in Europe grew by more than 18 per
cent to 1.33m with four vendors - Compaq, Toshiba, IBM and Apple -
accounting for 59.5 per cent of the market. However, portable computer sales
still represented only 17.4 per cent of the total European PC market.
'Although portable computing represents only a minority of the total PC
market, more and more people are adopting it in one form or another,
particularly in a business environment,' says Jeffrey Goldberg, a Dataquest
consultant. 'The notebook computer has replaced the secretary as the
ubiquitous travelling companion.'
Growth of the portable PC market has flattened since the boom years of 1990
to 1992. Nevertheless, Dataquest predicts that between 1993 and 1998
portable computer sales will grow by a compound annual rate of 23.4 per
cent, compared with 8.4 per cent for desktop PCs.
Worldwide sales of mobile computing equipment, peripherals and services are
expected to grow to almost Dollars 45bn by 1997 according to
California-based Market Intelligence Research.
Business use of portable computers is undoubtedly increasing. When Dataquest
asked corporate computer purchasing managers across Europe whether any of
their employees used portable PCs, 70 per cent replied 'yes', with the UK
and Germany showing the highest uptake. The three largest groups of users
were top executives and finance staff, sales and marketing and engineering
and maintenance.
More than 32 per cent also claimed at least some of their employees were
able to use their portable PCs or data terminals for communicating with the
office while travelling. Most of these employees made their connection over
the public switched telephone network although a quarter said they used
cellular telephone connections, 18.5 per cent used private or public mobile
radio and a similar proportion said they used mobile packet data services.
In the study, the most important uses listed for mobile data communications
were sending and receiving electronic mail, sending and receiving
facsimiles, transferring files, accessing purchase and inventory databases
and accessing customer and invoicing databases.
A modem (modulator/de-modulator) enables a computer to exchange digital data
over an older-style analogue telephone line with another machine, typically
a head office computer which is also equipped with a modem and has become
another essential piece of equipment for many travelling professionals.
'Connectivity is becoming a more and more important feature of mobile
computing, especially aimed at making life easier for business users who are
on the move,' says Steve Crawley, AST's product marketing manager. 'The
latest trend shows it will soon become commonplace to bundle communications
add-ons with portable PCs.'
Modems come in a number of shapes and sizes and are getting faster, smarter
and cheaper. Some, usually based on proprietary designs, fit inside the
machine but external modems - including some which fit into PCMCIA card
slots - usually offer faster transmission speeds together with sophisticated
data compression and error correction features. Most also provide the
facility to send and receive faxes direct from the screen.
Currently most portable modems, including PCMCIA card modems, are designed
to be plugged into a wall telephone socket. However, wireless modems have
begun to appear which work either with existing analogue cellular mobile
telephone services or with the new breed of dedicated digital mobile
packet-switched data networks such as the Ram Mobile Data network in the UK.
These modems represent the ultimate in portability since they allow mobile
computer users to transmit or receive data and faxes from virtually
anywhere. Eventually, however, there may be no need for modems at all since,
at least in theory, it should be possible to plug a digital device,
including portable computers, directly into the next generation of mobile
telephones operating on digital cellular networks such as the GSM networks
in Europe.
Eventually, the continued convergence of telephone and computer technologies
is expected to lead to multi-purpose handheld digital devices which will
combine the functions of data processing and voice and data
telecommunications.
Sales of the first generation of so-called personal digital assistants, such
as Apple's Newton, did not live up to expectations, largely because they
lacked sophisticated wireless telecommunications facilities.
According to Dataquest, the European market for handheld computers,
including pen-based machines, actually declined from an estimated 401,000
units in 1992 to 283,000 last year.
'For the future we predict that familiar keyboard-driven handhelds will
comfortably outsell pen handhelds, but these will most likely be hybrid
machines using a pen for drawing and pointing, and the keyboard for text
entry,' says Mr Goldberg.
Dataquest argues that wider acceptance of handheld PCs is highly dependent
on the availability of ubiquitous and cheap connectivity, in particular
wireless networking, and on a rationalisation of the many competing
platforms.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (2): Statistics gap delays plans -
Western groups see opportunities in Russia

When the mayor of Tursunzade fired several pistol shots at the general
manager of Tajikistan's aluminium smelter, the news ricocheted around the
global industry. For the Tursunzade smelter is one of the world's biggest,
and its output was already falling because of civil warfare and shortages of
raw materials and electricity.
For Mr Mikhail Sinani, the man sent from Russia with a team of technicians
to help the Tajiks keep this vital source of foreign earnings up and
running, the murder attempt was the last straw.
Even though the smelter is now being protected by Russian paratroopers, Mr
Sinani decided not to return to Tajikstan when his holiday in Russia ended
recently.
Tursunzade's mayor, Mr Ibodullah Boymatov, had asked for a large consignment
of aluminium for delivery to a foreign trader, but did not have proper
documentation. When Mr Sinani refused to provide the metal, the mayor pulled
out his pistol. Some local reports suggest that Mr Sinani returned his fire.
Fortunately, neither man was hurt but the damage to the future of the
smelter - the largest single enterprise in the southernmost former Soviet
republic - is incalculable.
Without Russian help the smelter's output, already down to only 252,000
tonnes in 1993 compared with its annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes, is
expected to fall steeply - some informed estimates suggest to only 100,000
tonnes.
Whether the former Soviet Union industry will ever supply more than
'informed estimates' remains to be seen. Soviet aluminium production
statistics were a state secret for so long that even a reformed Russia seems
reluctant to give them.
'Now that Russia is being absorbed into the global aluminium industry, we
are desperately trying to get some statistics, some facts, that will let us
get on with some proper planning,' one senior western executive complained
recently.
Russia has agreed to supply production and export statistics to the
International Primary Aluminium Institute, the London-based organisation
which collects data for the western producers. However, the Institute is
still waiting for the go-ahead by for a fact-finding visit to the Russian
smelters to collect necessary background information.
Western executives complain that, since the Russian smelters were
privatised, the situation has become even more chaotic. The central
authorities have no control - and no statistics - while anyone wanting to do
deals with the smelters has no clear idea who to talk to.
The chaos is amply illustrated by the present situation surrounding
Krasnoyarsk, Russia's second-largest smelter. Pechiney, Europe's biggest
aluminium group, announced in July that it had won Russian government
support for a scheme to modernise gradually the Siberian aluminium smelters
 -Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk - which between them account for
about half of Russia's aluminium production capacity, but are among the
world's heaviest polluters.
Mr Bernard Legrand, head of Pechiney's aluminium activities, said that a
start would be made at Krasnoyarsk with a 'module' of 250,000 tonnes of
annual capacity to replace outdated existing equipment. Arranging finance
for this, an estimated USDollars 400m to Dollars 500m, and completing
detailed engineering studies would take 18 months to two years, and
construction another two years.
But at the same time Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminium producer, has been
talking to the Krasnoyarsk smelter management. According to local sources,
Alcoa wants to join forces with the hydro-electric company that supplies
Krasnoyarsk, to take over the entire plant and its production.
Similar ideas are being mulled over by Russian investment companies which,
together with western aluminium producers (Alussuise is rumoured to be among
them), might soon be putting them to the Krasnoyarsk management and the
Russian government.
In the meantime, Trans-World Metals, a London-based international trading
company which has been the biggest supplier of raw materials to Krasnoyarsk
and possibly its biggest customer for aluminium for export, is protecting
its commercial interest. Trans-World has organised consortia to acquire
large shareholdings, at least one-third, in Krasnoyarsk and three other
Russian smelters.
The position of trading houses like Trans-World is less secure following a
recent international trade agreement between some of the big
aluminium-producing nations which promised funds to help modernise the
Russian industry - and reduce its dreadful pollution - if it joined in a
worldwide cut in production.
But all this jockeying for position suggests that some western aluminium
groups see a unique opportunity to move in to a potentially huge new market.
Russia's smelters are being gradually absorbed into the global aluminium
industry. The Russian smelters that survive can also be expected to become
more like their western rivals and develop downstream fabricating
operations, because Russia eventually will consume more of its own
aluminium.
Mr Horst Peters, managing director of VAW Aluminium-Technologie, the German
group that is helping the Novokuznetsk smelter to modernise, suggests that
this battle for ownership of the smelters is one of the most important
issues in Russia today. 'It is a question of who will supply the raw
materials and who will take the metal in future.'
However, in the meantime, says Mr Peters, the physical condition of some of
the smelters is deteriorating rapidly. Consequently production will be down
by 10 to 15 per cent this year from the 1993 level, not because of the trade
agreement but because equipment is breaking and not being repaired. Russian
production is therefore likely to be about 2.5m tonnes compared with the
industry capacity of about 3.3m.
One third of the former Soviet Union's 3.6m tonnes of aluminium-smelting
capacity could be expected to disappear in the next five years, driven out
of production by high costs and obsolete equipment, according to Mr Peters.
He pointed out that, if they are to meet present Russian emission standards,
Russia's aluminium smelters needed total investment of USDollars 3.5bn.
Money for this purpose was presently not available in the former Soviet
Union, nor in the western financial markets, Mr Peters insisted.
So those smelters not worth modernising will be phased out. He suggests that
some heavily-polluting smelters could be modernised gradually. This could be
financed out of cash flows and some help from international financial
institutions or export credits.
Mr Peters insists that the Russian smelters are no longer low-cost
producers. They are having to pay world prices for alumina (an intermediate
material), and electricity and transport costs have been rising rapidly -
including the cost of security to protect the valuable metal on its travels
over vast distances. 'Some smelters say that, if they paid all their bills
they would be bankrupt.'
The projected fall in output should have the effect of stabilising Russia's
aluminium exports, Mr Peters suggests, because 'domestic demand is at
rock-bottom.' Aluminium sales in Russia, which fell to only 600,000 tonnes
in 1993, are now running below an annual rate of 400,000 tonnes. Yet there
is demand for aluminium products there - for example, all the aluminium
windows needed for the damaged parliament building in Moscow were imported
from the west.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (3): Next year may see a shortfall as
stocks decline - The new global deal has cut production. But can it last?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unprecedented international trade agreement signed in February to
encourage aluminium producers to cut production has transformed the market
this year.
Prices have risen to levels where all producers are making profits, and the
huge level of world stocks has started to fall as consumption outstrips
production at last.
The fact that western producers sought an international deal to help curb
the flood of metal from Russia is a measure of their desperation at the
interminable build-up of stocks. By the end of last year, reported stocks
totalled almost 4.5m tonnes, with 2.49m tonnes at the London Metal Exchange
and just over 2m tonnes at the International Primary Aluminium Institute.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) - signed by Australia, Canada, the
European Union, Norway and the US, as well as by Russia - soon started to be
reflected in rising prices on the London exchange. By July, prices were 50
per cent above the eight-year low of last November  - Dollars 1,037 a tonne.
The memorandum called for production cuts of up to 2m tonnes, including
500,000 tonnes in the former Soviet Union. The question now is how long can
it be expected to hold together. As Anthony Bird Associates, a UK
consultancy, pointed out in its annual review of the industry, there are
great difficulties in getting such agreements to work. In addition to the
conflict of interest between high- and low-cost producers, and legal
problems faced by American and Canadian producers, Bird points out that,
when such agreements collapse, 'the results can be devastating' - and he
cites the 1985 tin crisis.
Bird bases his forecasts on the assumption 'that the MOU will be mostly
successful for a limited period.' Bird, in April, suggested that production
and consumption should be roughly in balance this year.
Since then, however, indications are that stocks will fall.
Billiton-Enthoven Metals' analysts are looking for a supply deficit of
400,000 tonnes, with Western world output at 14.15m tonnes, net imports at
1.6m tonnes, and consumption at 16.15m tonnes.
Another recent assessment - the Spector Report of the US - put the estimated
decline in world stocks at 700,000 tonnes this year, in stark contrast to
the 1.5m tonne increase in 1993.
However, the real impact is likely to come next year. Bird suggests that
supplies should be around 1.4m tonnes below output, while Billiton is
predicting a shortfall of 1.18m tonnes.
The prospective fall in stocks is not merely a reflection of production
curbs - consumption is growing strongly, and has been remarkably healthy
throughout the recession.
'We have little reservation in stating that the underlying demand outlook
for aluminium is good, and probably better than for any of the other major
base metals, with the possible exception of nickel,' says Billiton in its
annual Aluminium Market Report. The report points to the underlying growth
rate in non-mature economies, particularly south-east Asia, which increased
its share of western aluminium consumption from 10.4 per cent to 19.1 per
cent between 1979 and 1992. By the end of the decade, the proportion could
be almost 25 per cent.
At the same time, aluminium continues to take market share from other metals
and materials in the industrialised economies. This is particularly true of
the automobile industry. In addition, the packaging sector is continuing to
grow spectacularly, and has proved itself impervious to recession. Billiton
concludes that 'aluminium, mainly in the form of can sheet, will not only
continue to dominate the expanding US beverage can market, but will also
make increasing inroads in the European and Japanese markets where there
remains considerable scope for growth.'
However, it warns that much of the growth in packaging and automobile
sectors is linked with recycling. 'Thus to some extent the growth in primary
consumption will be constrained by competition from its own remelted scrap.'
Nevertheless, Billiton believes an underlying growth rate of between 2.5 and
3 per cent can be achieved to the end of the decade and beyond.
Bird is even more optimistic, predicting growth of 3.4 per cent between 1990
and 2004. It points out that one of the main reasons for the sector's
resilience in the recession was the 'strong competitive position, which we
expect to see maintained in the years ahead. But in addition we think the
aluminium intensity of any given level of industrial activity has risen.'
Ironically, demand for the metal is likely to outstrip production once the
stocks overhanging the market have been drawn down, which will probably take
only three years.
Bird points out that there has been an investment famine in the west,
because of the short-term excess of supply. As the rate of capacity
utilisation is already above 90 per cent, 'it would not take much of a
supply correction to bring the industry back to the point where new capacity
was needed very urgently.'
The only big project due to come on stream before the end of 1996 is the
Alusaf smelter in South Africa. However, Spector believes that, in order to
meet demand in 1997 and 1998, the industry needs a further 1.5m and 2.6m
tonnes respectively of new capacity, 'and that's just not on the cards at
the moment.'
Observers wonder if the Russians will be able to make up the shortfall. Bird
argues that there will be further falls in exports from the former Soviet
Union, not because of the MOU, but because of cost constraints.
In the west, production costs have been falling to an average of Dollars
1,135 a tonne. Russian costs are alreadyhigher at Dollars 1,234 a tonne - a
level at which they can now make money. However, hyperinflation in the
former Soviet Union is clearly evident when comparing the costs in 1990,
which were only 3 per cent of the western world average. Bird thinks the
Russians will 'price themselves out of western markets as a result of this
cost explosion.'
Paradoxically, the MOU, and the consequent rise in market prices, has taken
some of the short-term pressure off the Russians. At the end of August,
Spector suggested that Russian exports had already peaked, and that they
could be down by as much as 100,000 tonnes a month for the last five months
of this year.
Taking all the indications together, it looks as though the remainder of the
decade will prove an exciting time for the industry, with strong growth and
a need for expansion. As Spector puts it: 'The fundamentals look great and
are getting better.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Aluminium (1): Prices bounce back after global
deal - Kenneth Gooding describes how the industry took steps to overcome the
problems caused by the huge increase in aluminium exports from Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Road signs are disappearing again. Thieves know that the signs are probably
made of aluminium, one of the few widely-used materials worth stealing.
There is hardly a better indicator that aluminium prices are going up and
the industry's state of health is improving than this disreputable practice.
If prices go on rising as they have in the past few months, it won't be long
before the thieves become more daring: in the 1989 price boom one night in
Hull, in the north of England, an entire canal footbridge disappeared.
The rise in aluminium prices - by more than 50 per cent since last November
 -was prompted by production cuts, rising demand and investment fund
interest.
Less than a year ago, prices were at an all-time low in real terms, and the
industry was suffering. Producers worldwide were experiencing heavy
financial losses. More than half the west's aluminium smelters were not even
covering their day-to-day operating costs.
'It seemed that, if the end of the world wasn't going to happen tomorrow, it
would certainly come next week,' said Mr Lloyd O'Carroll, economist at
Reynolds Metals, the world's third largest aluminium group.
The industry's woes were not caused by the global recession. Demand for
aluminium continued to reach record levels, as it has every year since 1983.
In any case, the industry had prepared itself to cope with the inevitable
ups and downs that a cyclical commodity has to expect. What took it - and
everybody else - by surprise was a massive rise in aluminium exports from
Russia, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. Russian
aluminium exports to the west tripled in 1991 to 1m tonnes, and rose to an
estimated 2m tonnes in both 1992 and 1993. This was equivalent to about 13
per cent being added to western world supply at incredible speed - usually
the industry gets a three-year warning of new capacity, because it takes
that long for a new smelter to be built and started up.
In January 1989, before the Russian aluminium invasion, stocks in London
Metal Exchange warehouses totalled only 136,000 tonnes, and the LME
aluminium price was Dollars 1 a lb (Dollars 2,204 a tonne). Last November,
as LME stocks climbed towards a record 2.5m tonnes, the price had dropped to
47 cents (Dollars 1,036 a tonne). Yet in recent weeks it has been above 77
cents a lb (Dollars 1,700 a tonne).
The industry itself helped to create this remarkable recovery. Since last
November, it has announced plans to cut 1.25m tonnes of capacity, either
permanently or temporarily - 900,000 tonnes of this in the west.
These cuts were prompted by an unprecedented trade agreement between the
European Union and five of the largest aluminium producing countries -
Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia and the US.
A memorandum of understanding, signed in Brussels in February, identified a
global oversupply of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year, and suggested cuts
of that size should be made for between 18 months and two years, to restore
the balance of supply and demand. Russia agreed that if cuts were made in
the west, it would cut output, by 500,000 tonnes a year.
Although Russia and western producers are unlikely to deliver all the cuts
that were hoped for, the deal laid the groundwork for a recovery in the
market.
This attracted help from an unexpected quarter - the investment funds which
were casting round for something new to invest in at a time of falling bond
prices and weak stock markets. They decided to put some of their cash into
base-metals markets.
'The funds' intervention was unprecedented, incredible in its size and
volume. It was beautifully timed and their analysis that the aluminium
market was due for a swift recovery was spot on,' says Mr Roger
Scott-Taggart, director of research at Alcan, the world's second-largest
aluminium group. 'People in the industry, peering over the rim of the
trenches, didn't believe there would be a serious recovery this year. But
the funds created that recovery on the back of a much better fundamental
market balance.'
The market's underlying strength was clear for anyone to see. Annual growth
in demand did not go into reverse, it merely slowed from 3 per cent to 1.5
per cent.
Partly this was because aluminium has a wide variety of uses. Packaging is
one of its best markets - the metal is easy to sterilise for food and
medical applications; it is an excellent barrier against liquids, vapours
and light; it is non-toxic and imparts no taste or odour. There has also
been good growth in the use of aluminium in electrical wiring, construction
and in the transport sector (aeroplanes, trains and automobiles.)
Global growth in demand for aluminium this year has set a cracking pace, led
by the US where shipments of primary metal rose by a remarkable 11 per cent
in the first half. Reynolds' economist, Mr O'Carroll, suggests western world
consumption will probably rise by 7 per cent this year to 16.7m tonnes. He
adds: 'We are probably at the begining of a three- to five-year up-cycle for
aluminium.' He sees global annual demand rising at between 3 and 5 per cent.
This growth will come from beverage cans and cars in particular.
Nearly every beer and fizzy drink can in the US is made from aluminium,
where once they were tin plated-steel, so any growth there will have to come
from winning business away from glass and plastic containers. However, other
parts of the world offer tremendous opportunities for the aluminium can.
Mr Richard Holder, Reynolds Metals' chairman, is predicting that the global
aluminium can market will grow by 65 per cent by the year 2000.
As if that were not enough, aluminium has another 'avalanche' market
developing after many years of careful preparation - the use of more
aluminium in cars. The amount of aluminium in the average car has doubled
from 32kgs (70 lbs) in the late 1970s to 68kgs (150 lbs), and even the most
conservative industry forecasts see it doubling again by 2010.
In the US, this trend is being driven by ever-tightening fuel economy
targets set by the government. Aluminium's light weight enables car makers
to meet these targets without reducing the size of vehicles. Consequently,
the US Aluminium Association is predicting that aluminium in the average
American car will rise from 210 lbs at present to 350 lbs by 2000.
Reynolds' Mr Holder suggests that next year shipments of aluminium in the US
to the transport industry will reach 5.16bn lbs (2.4m tonnes), and for the
first time will top those to the packaging industry - forecast to be 5.04bn
lbs (2.28m tonnes).
Some analysts suggest that there might even be a shortage of primary
smelting capacity in the late 1990s, because nearly every planned smelter
project was shelved during the recession. Mr O'Carroll at Reynolds says it
would not surprise him if there were one or two years of too little
capacity. But aluminium prices would not stay at extraordinarily high levels
for very long. Most commentators say that prices of between 75 and 65 cents
a lb (Dollars 1,653 and Dollars 1,873 a tonne) would be enough to encourage
banks to put up some of the USDollars 1bn a time needed for new aluminium
smelters.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa),
dismisses the idea that shortages of aluminium and exceptionally high prices
will appear. However, he says that by late in 1995 it will be necessary to
re-start all the smelting capacity recently shut down.
Alcoa drew up forecasts for 13 big aluminium-consuming countries - by no
means a world-embracing list - and this showed potential demand for another
8.9bn lbs (3.8m tonnes) of aluminium by 2004, equivalent to 25 per cent of
last year's primary aluminium. 'And,' insists Mr O'Neill, 'that does not
take into account the potentially large increase of aluminium usage in
automobiles.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (1): System distinctions
begin to vanish -  While the PC has become the leading agent for change,
Paul Taylor finds that office equipment is combining features to become
multi-functional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Digital technology is transforming the way companies do business. This is
most evident in the office where networks of powerful personal computers,
wireless telephony and high-speed communications links are re-shaping the
way we work.
Data processing and digital telecommunications in particular have changed
the way information is collected, manipulated, analysed and stored. Now
these technologies are converging, bringing the integrated digital office
closer.
In the process they are enriching the office environment by bringing new
value-added services, such as video-conferencing, electronic mail,
electronic data interchange (EDI) and multimedia, to the desktop.
The most dramatic change since the early 1980s has been the arrival of the
personal computer and workstation. Today an estimated 100m PCs and
workstations are in use across the globe. Each new microprocessor generation
brings more power to the desktop at the same or lower prices. The
accelerating pace of silicon engineering means that most desktop machines
now have the power and storage capacity of yesterday's mainframe machines.
Such high performance machines are required to handle the sophisticated and
power-hungry software developed by Microsoft and others.
Increasingly these PCs are hooked together using hard-wire and wireless
telecommunications links to form local and wide-area networks (Lans and
Wans) which can share data and peripherals like printers, computer-based fax
machines, scanners and other equipment. This process of computer platform
substitution - from mainframe to desktop PC and mid-range machines called
'servers', has become known as 'downsizing', or 'rightsizing'.
The fact that the PC has become an indispensable business tool and an agent
for change in the workplace is reflected in a study* of the European market
undertaken by Context, an IT research firm, and published recently by the
Economist Intelligence Unit.
The authors note that in spite of recession and cutbacks, the PC market has
grown by 12.5 per cent in unit terms in 1992 and by about 14 per cent in
1993. 'Projections for 1994 are that demand will continue to rise and that
unit growth could increase by more than 20 per cent on 1993,' the report
says.
'The reasons for this sustained growth are simple. Business in the 1990s
cannot compete without the efficiency and technology provided by computers.
The PC best fulfils these requirements in a form that is versatile,
flexible, powerful and, most important of all, affordable. The massive price
reductions of the past two years have played a vital part in promoting
continued growth in the sale of PCs.'
The PC may have improved office productivity, but it has not led to the
creation of the paperless office some had predicted. At least 80 per cent of
information used in the office is still stored on paper, rather than
electronically.
The growing use of electronic trading and EDI in the UK and elsewhere has
begun to cut into the stacks of documentation which business transactions
generate, but progress is slow.
In the US more than a third of companies are expected to buy document
management systems this year and new hardware such as digital optical
scanning, storage and retrieval devices have begun to appear in offices.
But so, too, have new paper generators such as high-volume electronic demand
printers which link directly to computers, digital offset presses and
digital copiers which scan a hard copy once and allow image manipulation
before reproducing multiple copies.
Other digital multi-functional office equipment is also beginning to appear,
blurring of distinctions between individual devices. Most of these devices
combine some or all of the features of a facsimile machine, photocopier,
laser printer and scanner.
Meanwhile, other bottlenecks in the office communications infrastructure
have been attracting attention. In particular the lack of flexibility,
inefficiencies and unnecessary costs imposed by hard-wired
telecommunications links are being challenged by new wireless alternatives -
in much the same way that cellular telephones and mobile data have begun to
change perceptions of telecommunications outside the office.
A growing number of businesses are using digital cellular telephony,
portable computers and mobile data networks to exchange information between
the central office database and mobile employees such as salesmen or
engineers.
Now within the office, several PABX (private automatic branch exchange)
manufactures have launched digital cordless voice systems. Similarly
wireless Lans linking desktop computers, workstations and other devices,
without the need for fixed cabling have begun to appear.
Meanwhile the volume and variety of information requiring delivery to the
desktop is set to grow rapidly as desktop video-conferencing and multimedia
applications become increasingly commonplace.
Some computers now come fully equipped for video-conferencing, allowing
users to transmit live video images of themselves to other, similarly-
equipped users, and to see on their PC the person they are talking to. But
for the moment most PC users will have to buy a special kit if they want to
carry out a video-conference in a window on their screen.
In order to deliver these multimedia services across networks, new high
speed, high capacity packet-switched technologies, such as ATM (Asynchronous
Transfer Mode), have been developed. As they are adopted, the remaining
distinctions between office voice and data lines are likely to vanish.
The rapid pace of change means corporate and other information technology
users are having to spend increasing amounts to remain in step with new
technology. The annual Price Waterhouse information technology review**
published last month and based on a survey of 1,000 information technology
executives, found that IT spending jumped by 15 per cent last year across
the corporate sector - a sharp increase given the low inflation rate and far
above the 0.2 per cent increase that the same organisations had predicted at
the start of of 1993.
The survey found IT spending to be closely tied to restructuring. Two-thirds
of organisations claimed to have programmes in place and 28 per cent of IT
executives said they were themselves the main architect of change in their
organisation.
'This study confirms that managers in major companies are now re-thinking
their operations and re-equipping their IT systems to fit new market
conditions,' says Jane Lucien-Scholle, head of the IT practice of Price
Waterhouse Management.
The survey also highlights the marked trend away from mainframe-based
systems to PC-based client-server networks. Client-server computing was the
most popular of the new and emerging technologies and has been implemented
by 58 per cent of the respondents and was ranked number one in offering the
greatest potential benefit.
Other new technologies popular with the executives included document image
processing and workflow systems which are being used by organisations with
high volumes of paper which need to be stored such as credit card receipts
and cancelled cheques.
'All these findings point in the same direction,' says Ms Lucien-Scholle.
'Management is looking very deeply into the competitive implications of IT.
They want change, but are resisting superficial responses. They are
investing, but they also want value.
'The ways in which they spend these very large sums and adapt their
organisations to exploit new systems are likely to have a critical influence
on competitive performance and profits in the years ahead.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury hints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern that Cadbury-Schweppes might be poised to make a fresh acquisition
were sharpened by an announcement concerning the food and soft drink group's
stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, third biggest soft drinks group in the US.
Cadbury filed an amendment to Schedule 13D - an obligatory requirement for
large holders of stakes in US companies - relating to its investment in Dr
Pepper. The amendment is seen principally as an update but ensures that
Cadbury has the possibility of changing its 25 per cent stake significantly.
There are two likely scenarios, according to the market. First, Cadbury may
make an outright bid for Dr Pepper because it has, so far, been unable to
obtain a seat on the board. However several analysts favour the second
possibility, that Cadbury will wait until the Dr Pepper shares have reached
an acceptable level and sell its stake to fund an acquisition of SmithKline
Beecham's Lucozade and Ribena arm.
Either way, it is likely to increase gearing. Last year the company spent
Pounds 476m last year on acquisitions, raising Pounds 340m of the cost
through a rights issue. Nevertheless, it has said it can finance Pounds 400m
to Pounds 500m of acquisitions without recourse to shareholders. Cadbury
shares fell 10 to 425p. Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up shares were up around 10 per
cent during London trading hours.
The life assurance stocks were easier, but no worse than the wider market,
after the Securities and Investments Board published its review of
mis-selling of personal pensions.
One marketmaker described the SIB news as 'slightly less worrying than the
market had been expecting,' but pointed out that it would 'leave a shadow
over the sector until the mess is sorted out.'
There was heavy trading in Prudential shares, where turnover reached 7.3m,
with the stock price down 4 at 298p, while Legal &amp; General dipped 8 to 428p
on 1.1m traded and Lloyds Abbey Life 4 to 326p.
Dealers pointed out the continuing heavy trade in Standard Chartered, where
turnover reached 5.8m shares, and the outperformance of the shares, steady
at 279p, following further aggressive buying by one of the City's leading
marketmakers.
Abbey National fell 8 to 403p, affected by the stock's inclusion in a
sizeable programme trade with a block of 2m shares said to have been
unloaded on the market at 401p.
Worries about the impact of market turbulence, unsettled SG Warburg, which
dropped 17 to 614p. Kleinwort Benson, on the other hand, edged higher to
467p.
Building and plumbing products group Wolseley delivered excellent
preliminary figures, including profits at thevery top end of the range of
analysts' forecasts and a dividend total only fractionally short of best
expectations, but its shares were hampered by the steep decline in the
market.
At the close the shares were 8 off at 725p, having traded between 72,2p and
730p; turnover was a relatively high 1.5m. Analysts were said to be lifting
1995 estimates from the current figure of around Pounds 230m-Dollars 240m to
around Pounds 250m to Pounds 260m.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca held firm as the group announced third quarter
sales had risen by 8 per cent. The shares were 9 weaker in early trading,
reflecting the weak US currency but rallied to close steady at 838p.
Smith New Court's latest quarterly review of diversified industrial
companies help lift Williams Holdings 4 to 339p against the market with the
shares heading the securities house's best in the sector list.
BTR - the day's most active Footsie stock - dipped 1 1/2 to 301p in turnover
of 14m, of which 5m was a programme trade said to have been executed by
Goldman Sachs.
Food retailer Argyll slipped 8 1/2 to 257p as one securities house had to
work hard to place a block of 2m shares.
Large amounts of stock looking for a home also restrained retailer Next.
Dealers said 1.3m shares were sold at below the current market price and the
shares fell 6 1/2 to 235p.
The recent moves by regional electricity companies to buy back stock and pay
special dividends sharpened old speculation that Great Universal Stores
would try and find a way of distributing part of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile
to shareholders. It holds its annual meeting on Friday - potentially an
ideal time. The shares dropped a penny to 558p.
Up 4 at 534p, Bass stood out in a brewery sector clouded by the failure of
the Lazard Brewers Investment Trust which was to have acquired Whitbread's
share stakes in a number of regional drinks groups.
Wolverhampton and Dudley tumbled 12 to 512p while cider group Bulmer fell 18
to 398p. Greene King closed 3 down at 528p. Whitbread fell 4 to 548p.
GKN shed 8 to 601p in fairly nominal 1.5m turnover following a trade press
report that Lynx helicopters worldwide had been grounded.
The company's subsequent denial of the report had little affect on weak
sentiment among engineering shares.

FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP firm against the trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP was one of only a handful of FT-SE 100 constituents to make progress
yesterday, the shares responding to excellent exploration news from its
latest well in the Foinavon field, west of the Shetland Islands, but also to
better than expected third-quarter figures from a number of US oil majors.
BP is scheduled to announce third-quarter results next Tuesday. Analysts
were sceptical of, but refused to rule out completely, the chances of an
increase in the quarterly dividend.
Another bull point for BP, sector specialists said, was the absence in
recent sessions of any substantial selling from the US. A number of US
funds, who bought into BP around 18 months ago at around the Dollars 50 mark
for each ADR, the equivalent of 12 BP ordinaries, have been persistent
sellers of the stock from Dollars 70 upwards. US holdings are now below the
20 per cent mark, compared with a peak of over 26 per cent.
Analysts were enthusiastic about flow rates averaging 17,000 barrels a day
from well 204/24a-4 in the Foinavon field; 'It suggests the area will be a
major new oil province for both BP and Shell and it could be that the market
has not fully taken on board the financial impact of this,' said one. BP has
an 80 per cent stake in the Foinavon block and Shell 20 per cent. Elsewhere,
west of the Shetlands BP and Shell are mostly 50/50 partners.
BP were marginally higher at 411p. Shell fell 6 1/2 to 694p.

FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE Index struggles to hold the
3,000 mark - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fortunes of the dollar and the US bond markets continued to undermine
equities in London yesterday. The market plunged through the FT-SE 3,000
mark at the opening and although the Index managed to struggle back to this
benchmark at the close, the mood remained depressed.
The recovery in the second half of the session reflected the rally in New
York bonds. The final reading of 3000.9 on the FT-SE Index showed a fall on
the day of 28.2 points, but the Index had been down to 2,985.6.
The weakness in Federal bonds, reflected in the move above 8 per cent in
yield on the key long bond, overwhelmed all other factors in UK equities
yesterday morning. However, the stock market also reacted uncomfortably to
the latest survey of business opinion from members of the Confederation of
British Industry, which referred to expectations of higher prices. This
fuelled fears that the next rise in base rates might come before the end of
the year, especially if US bonds continue to exert similar upward pressures
on global rates.
Although trading volumes remained moderate yesterday, one leading US
investment bank was believed to have lost money heavily after taking on a
very large sell programme which had to be passed on into the market after
share prices had fallen heavily. The programme, displayed on the trading
screens just before the close of dealing, included substantial tranches of
stock in such leading names as BTR, RTZ, Reed International, British Gas and
Abbey National.
The programme also took in a large number of small-capitalised stocks, which
are notably difficult to unload when markets are weak, and are likely to
have cost the US bank dear in yesterday's conditions. Trading programmes
have become high risk operations in a volatile market.
Stock index futures provided the impetus for much of the action in equities.
The FT-SE Index opened nearly 30 points down and gave further ground as
bonds slid lower. Turnover in equities was fairly restrained at first, with
market traders unwilling, to venture into the market.
The Seaq total was swollen later when the sell programme was printed and the
final total of 569.7m shares was nearly 25 per cent up on the previous
session. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of the total
business.
Losses among the dollar-earners played a significant role in depressing the
FT-SE 100 Index; City analysts calculate that that around one fifth of
aggregate profits of the Footsie -listed companies are influenced by the
dollar's fortunes. However, oil shares proved relatively resistant to dollar
pressures and utility stocks strongly outperformed the market on dividend
optimism.
Base rate nervousness showed itself in weakness among the retail and
consumer stocks, where most of the high street store groups gave ground.
There were few beneficiaries, however, from the CBI report's stress on
investment plans among British companies.
Traders stressed that the sharpness of the market's bounce when New York
steadied - the Dow Average was 7 points up in UK hours - implied that London
could open higher today if US bonds extend their recovery.
This afternoon brings the disclosure of the latest monthly US durable goods
figures, which have in the past proved highly significant for US bond
trends. Analysts are predicting a small fall after the 6.1 per cent gain in
the previous monthly data, a trend which could prove helpful for bond
markets. But confidence will be tested later this week when Washington
releases statistics on unemployment claims and third quarter gross domestic
product. Markets are also nervous ahead of tomorrow's meeting at the
Bundesbank.

FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures fell for the third session in a row, moving decisively
down through the 3,000 level at one stage in heavy trading volume, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract swung through an arc of 32 points in what
traders described as hectic activity. There were 18,600 contracts, against
5,523 on Monday and an average for last week of less than 13,000.
At the official 4:0 close, the December contract was 3,009, down 21 points.
At this level the premium to the cash market was around 9 points with fair
value premium at 14 points.
Traders said the upsurge in volume reflected the strong swings in the cash
market rather than any real attempt to provide direction. The low point for
the December contract was just after mid-day at 2,081.
Quality of business improved with plenty of two-way business allowing
traders to deal in amounts larger than has been the norm recently.
Traded options activity mirrored index futures volume, roaring ahead to
49,676 lots from 13,951 on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover accounted
for more than 31,000 lots.
British Airways was far and away the most actively dealt individual stock
option turning over 2,840 lots. Tesco (1,600 lots) and British Gas (1,232
lots) were also actively traded.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico loses 2.1%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mexican stocks closed down 2.1 per cent because of worse-than-expected third
quarter results of market bellwether Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex).
The market's key IPC index closed off 55.24 points at 2,578.38 - a loss of
2.10 per cent. Volume totaled a moderately heavy 1.39m new pesos, on 111.2m
shares traded.
A late technical closing rebound prevented the endex expereiring its worst
decline since the 6.01 per cent fall on April 4. At one stage the market was
off 4.78 per cent on the back of the lackluster earnings report from the
national telephone monopoly.
Telmex announced that its net income rose only 1.5 per cent to 7.145bn new
pesos, less than expected by the consensus of market watchers.
Local analysts said the steep fall in Telmex share prices was largely a
result of foreign players changing positions and at least one foreign
brokerage cutting its 1994 Telmex earnings estimate.
Rumours that Mr Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, top official of the ruling party,
had resigned disturbed the market.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities lower on drift by
bonds, dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Most US share prices finished lower yesterday after stocks paralleled a
uncertain drift by bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.71 at 3,850.59,
but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.69 at 461.52.
Despite its slight gain, declining issues on the NYSE led advances by a
two-to-one margin, on heavy volume of 326m shares.
In the other leading markets, the Nasdaq composite closed down 2.95 at
758.26 and the American SE composite dipped 0.88 to 452.85.
The Dow industrials began with a 16-point deficit, but managed to crawl back
to their starting point by mid-morning thanks to some improvement in the
bond market.
Longer dated Treasuries, which were carrying their highest yields and lowest
prices in more than two years, appreciated on the Conference Board's
announcement that consumer confidence had sagged last month. But the ensuing
bargain-hunting quickly petered out, and concerns over the weak dollar and
monetary policy soon reasserted themselves. The blue chips began to slump
anew, only to claw most of their way back by the close.
Some stocks performed well, however, largely in response to a generally
favourable tranche of earnings news.
The second round of results from the energy group produced a few pleasant
surprises. Texaco, one of the Dow components, gained Dollars 7/8 to Dollars
63 after it posted third-quarter net income of 98 cents, about 25 per cent
better than analysts had forecast. Exxon, another Dow industrial, earned a
late reward for better-than-expected results revealed during the previous
session. The stock climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 .
But it was Mobil, up Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , which fared the best
among the oil companies. Dean Witter Reynolds lifted its rating on the stock
as the company completed a study on ways to cut costs and restructure its
operations.
USX-US Steel was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 3/8 even though its
third quarter net, published after Monday's close, jumped to Dollars 1.11
from 41 cents a year earlier.
By contrast, Eastman Kodak escaped unscathed after it posted earnings of 57
cents, well under forecast. The stock added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48,
though it had fallen by nearly 11 per cent since mid-September on
anticipation of just such a result.
Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, slumped Dollars 1 1/2 3 to
Dollars 33 1/4 after announcing a joint venture with Tele-Communications,
Comcast and Cox Enterprises.
In pharmaceuticals, Baxter International lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 on
news that its third quarter net had fallen short of Wall Street
expectations.
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 on the revelation
of talks over a possible acquisition of the soft-drinks company by Cadbury
Schweppes, whose ADRs receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 on the Nasdaq.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends lower ahead
of Japan Tobacco listing

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Worries over the higher yen and tomorrow's listing of Japan Tobacco eroded
investor confidence and share prices lost ground for the third consecutive
day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 120.22 to close at the day's low of 19,732.15,
after opening at a high of 19,831.87. The market was hit by arbitrage
selling and position closing by dealers ahead of the last trading day for
October settlement today. Buying by financial institutions failed to counter
heavy selling and the index fell just before the close.
Volume was 219m shares against 181m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks fell 6.79 to 1,568.40 and the Nikkei 300 fell 1.18 to 286.82.
Declines led advances by 632 to 301, with 240 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose to 0.21 to 1,288.18.
An official announcement by the Finance Ministry that it would not unload
the unsold Japan Tobacco shares until next fiscal year failed to encourage
investors. Some market participants were worried that institutional
investors who had bought the stocks at the auction prior to the public
offering could sell their holdings.
The rise in the yen to the Y96 level hurt export oriented stocks. Fujitsu
fell Y10 to Y1,070 and Toshiba declined Y12 to Y751. Car makers were also
lower with Nissan Motor down Y18 to Y828 and Honda Motor losing Y30 at
Y1,700.
However, Matsushita Electric Industrial rose Y20 to Y1,600 after it
announced that its interim pre-tax profits had risen by 26 per cent and
revised up its full year forecast.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, snapped out of its eight day losing
streak, and rose Y380 to Y4,830 on bargain hunting, while Nintendo added
Y120 to Y5,170. Tsumura, the drug maker, put on Y80 to Y1,200.
Steels and heavy industry stocks were actively traded. Nippon Steel, the
day's most active issue, rose Y2 to Y390 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
added Y2 to Y766.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.36 to 22,017.55 in volume of 44.4m shares.
Roundup
The overnight fall on Wall Street brought early weakness to the region, but
some markets recovered later. Taiwan was closed for a holiday.
HONG KONG lost 1.25 per cent in low volume, with futures-linked trading
adding a further disincentive. The Hang Seng index fell 117.79 to 9,246.50
in turnover of HKDollars 2.3bn. October Hang Seng futures declined 170 to
9,220 on 21,000 contracts ahead of their expiration this Friday.
Hanny Magnetics, a manufacturer of video cassettes and floppy disks, gained
12 cents to HKDollars 1.05 amid speculation that Hutchison Whampoa would
purchase additional stock to maintain its stake in the group. Hutchison fell
60 cents to HKDollars 34.
SEOUL staged a rebound in blue chips, but brokers said that they expected
the rise to be short-lived as the composite stock index added 9.87 to
1,091.02.
Both Goldstar and Yukong went limit up, gaining Won1,300 and Won1,600 to
close at Won31,700 and Won44,400 respectively.
Brokers said that tax payments due next week, amounting to some Won4,000bn,
and fears of intervention by the Korea Stock Market Stablisation Fund would
limit further rises. Last week the fund sold Won100bn worth of stocks in an
attempt to cool the market which had reached an historic high on October 18
of 1,127.
KUALA LUMPUR's
composite index ended down 6.84 at 1,102.23 after hitting a low of 1,099.79.
Trading remained subdued with volume reaching 196m shares.
Acidchem led the day's activity with the shares rising 50 cents to MDollars
8.40 in volume of 8.2m shares. The company last Friday announced the
acquisition of the Penang bridge concession and a stake in the toll
operator, Metacorp.
SINGAPORE retreated on foreign investor-led selling of blue chips in light
trading, with many buyers sidelined.
The Straits Times Industrial index fell 14.32 to 2,362.54, in volume of 155m
shares.
Among the main losers Cycle and Carriage lost 30 cents to SDollars 13.40,
Keppel Corp 20 cents to SDollars 12.90 and Fraser and Neave 10 cents to
SDollars 17.20.
BANGKOK gave up 1.4 per cent in acknowledgment of negative sentiment in the
region, with the banking sector particularly badly hit.
The SET index lost 20.90 at 1,501.58, most of its losses coming in morning
trade. Turnover was moderate at Bt6.9bn.
Brokers said that foreign institutions were behind most of the selling.
The banks were sold heavily after recent gains, with the sub-index losing
nearly 2 per cent in turnover of Bt1.6bn. Krung Thai Bank was down Bt2 at
Bt86.
SYDNEY followed overseas markets down but it was also disturbed by sales of
futures as the All Ordinaries index fell 15.6 to 2,021.8 in turnover of
ADollars 431.9m.
The December futures contract fell by 31, or 1.5 per cent to 2,003.
Resources stocks fared worse than industrials but major banks finished
weaker, retracing Monday's gains. Dealers expected activity in banks to pick
up ahead of results expected from Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ
early November.
MANILA was led lower by Petron, which took it up on Monday, and the
composite index fell 23.81 to 3,089.34 as turnover rose from 1.81bn pesos to
3.73bn.
Petron fell 1.9 per cent to 25.50 pesos, Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co dipped by 2 per cent to 1,450 pesos and San Miguel B dropped 1.45 per
cent to 136.
BOMBAY extended its gains to a a third consecutive day; volumes remained
low, but brokers said that sentiment was much improved as the BSE 30-share
rose 27.21 to 4,355.58. The brokers said that the recovery was mainly due to
selective buying by Indian mutual funds and local investors.
KARACHI was dominated by bearish sentiment as the KSE 100 index fell 28.55,
or 1.25 per cent to 2,249.68; traders talked of a liquidity crunch, with
investors' money diverted to new issues.
COLOMBO came back to a fall of 2.85 per cent, on political uncertainty
following a day's curfew imposed after the assassination of the opposition
leader Mr Gamini Dissanayake. The all share index fell 31.74 to 1,081.27 and
turnover from Rs175.99m to Rs59.21m.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Johannesburg easier
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange followed international markets
lower. Brokers remarked that golds withstood an early assault from the
stronger financial and commercial rands, but succumbed later in the day
after bullion edged off the Dollars 390 an ounce level.
However, analysts said that they expected current declines, especially in
the industrial sector, to be short-lived; medium-term prospects remained
positive, especially if the recent stream of positive company results
continued.
The overall index lost 50 to 5,701, the industrial index fell 64 to 6,539
and the gold index 18 to 2,302.
Adcock Ingram rose 10 cents to R13.85 ahead of improved results and Edgars
rose R3 to R128 after announcing a 25 per cent increase in interim earnings
a share.
De Beers slipped R1.25 to finish at R99.25.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US indicator rescues bourses
in mid-afternoon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New lows for the dollar, and further weakness in bonds took bourses to falls
averaging 2 per cent in the early afternoon, when a slippage in US consumer
confidence in October seemed to rescue them from their worst fears, writes
Our Markets Staff.
Treasuries and European domestic bonds recovered, the dollar staged a
technical rally and bourses recovered half or more of their earlier losses.
But Mr Nicholas Knight, the Nomura strategist, said that he would want to
see a whole range of US data before he would believe that the US economy was
slowing down.
In the meantime, Mr Knight held to views expressed in a global strategy note
on Monday: 'Our cash allocation is the highest in two years, yet still feels
inadequate.'
FRANKFURT exemplified the European trend. The Dax index dropped 50.75, or
2.5 per cent to 1,974.63 by the end of floor trading and dealers were
prepared for it to test closing lows of around 1,950 for the year in later
trading.
However, bunds led an afternoon recovery after a morning drop of more than a
percentage point in December bund futures. Equities responded with the Ibis
indicated Dax closing 26.79, or 1.3 per cent better over 24 hours at
1,995.85.
Turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM7bn. RWE, Germany's largest electrical
utility with a decline in 1993/94 earnings per share, and MAN, which said
that its big commercial truck and bus division swung to a DM97.4m loss,
might have made an impact on another day; but they made little difference in
a market which left names like Bayer in chemicals, Deutsche Babcock in
engineering and Kaufhof in retailing with falls of 2 per cent or more at the
end of the afternoon.
PARIS fought back from a year's low in the CAC-40 index of 1,796.82 to close
the day with a loss of 17.17 to 1,824.42. The market began to rebuild itself
after Wall Street opened, having collapsed earlier following the sharp
increase in US Treasuries overnight.
The US consumer confidence data later in the day helped to steady nerves, at
least for the time being, although traders warned that, given the fact that
investors were very unsettled at the moment, further weakness was to be
expected.
Turnover was about FFr4bn.
In the corporate sector BNP lost FFr5.20 to FFr244.60 and said that it was
to discuss today a plan to turn its remaining investment certificates - some
800,000 - into ordinary shares, of which there are about 185m.
ZURICH's recovery from its intraday lows left the SMI index down 30.50, or
1.2 per cent at 2,494.7 after 2,472.7. The main loser in blue chips was SMH,
down SFr30 to SFr667 as two banks reduced their earnings forecasts for the
watch manufacturer.
Generally, stocks looked more vulnerable in the second tier. Pharma Vision,
the specialist investment fund, dropped SFr150 to SFr3,780 although Sandoz,
in the sector covered by the fund, lost only SFr9 at SFr641 on a 3 per cent
rise in nine-month sales. In floor and wall coverings, Forbo dropped SFr110
to SFr2,350 on a 10 per cent rise in nine-month profits, and in construction
equipment, Hilti lost SFr40 at SFr980 after it said that it had no plans to
place any of its registered share capital on the bourse.
AMSTERDAM broke away from the session low although investor confidence
remained nervous. The AEX index closed down 3.13 at 398.20, having fallen
earlier to a low of 394.62.
The market's dollar sensitive and heavily capitalised issues reacted
negatively to the US currency's continued weakness, but a few bright spots
were noted.
Nedlloyd, for instance, which had been pressured at the end of last week on
brokers' downgrades and a decision by a decision by the European Commission
blocking pricing and capacity agreements between shipping lines on
transatlantic container routes, added 70 cents to Fl 49.20. The group said
that it did not expect the decision to have an adverse effect on
profitability, and commented that Far East routes were holding up well.
MILAN gave up the gains made at the start of the week in another session
characterised by low volume. The Comit index finished down 8.01 or 1.3 per
cent at 613.78 .
Actinvest, the independent research group, commented that in the present
climate with turnover remaining depressed - an average of L500bn, although
yesterday that figure fell to L450bn - the market was likely to react with
exaggerated volatility to any sort of bearish news. 'It is probable,' said
Actinvest, 'that this stagnant period could last for at least one or two
months, until the budget is finally approved and there is more confidence in
the governing coalition's political capabilities.'
RAS, the insurance company in which Allianz of Germany has a majority stake,
shed 6 per cent to L17,790 after it said that it was to mount a L2,300bn
funding operation to cover its purchase of Elvia from Swiss Reinsurance,
announced earlier in the year.
RAS said that it would raise L1,150bn through a rights issue with warrants
attached and L1,150bn through a bond issue, also with warrants attached. The
capital increase is expected to begin on November 15.
Telecom Italia, which said on Monday that it planned to demerge its mobile
telecommunications division next year, lost L80 to L3,990, in line with the
market trend.
MADRID had a mixed day for headlines. It ended a new low for the year in
spite of an intraday recovery with other bourses, the general index closing
3.94, or 1.3 per cent lower at 289.30. But turnover recovered from Pta11.9bn
to Pta32.2bn, partly reflecting a big block trade by Bolsa Andino in Acesa,
the motorway operator, which fell Pta25 to Pta1,045.
Falls of 2 per cent or more were commonplace in the construction sector,
reasonably so in utilities where Telefonica dropped Pta35 at Pta1,650, but
still unusual in banks, Monday's resilient sector, where Argentaria stood
out with a fall of Pta100 to Pta4,780.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slips to fresh lows against D-Mark
and yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pessimism about the outlook for the US dollar yesterday pushed it to fresh
lows against both the D-Mark and the yen, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar touched a post-World War 2 low of Y96.35 against the yen, and a
two year low of DM1.4845 against the D-Mark, before recovering to finish in
London at Y96.86 and DM1.492.
There was no sign of concerted central bank intervention to support the
dollar, though numerous rumours swept the market.
Sentiment towards the US currency remains resolutely negative. Traders
described the afternoon rally as a technical correction, driven by covering
of short positions, rather than anything more fundamental.
Sterling continued its good run, touching a high for the year of Dollars
1.6405 against the dollar. The trade weighted index closed at 80.7 from
80.4, the highest level since early June. The pound is now 3 per cent higher
than during its recent lows attained last August.
In Europe the Swedish krona continued its advance, rising to SKr4.728 from
SKr4.748 against the D-Mark.
Trade in the dollar was driven more by technical factors, and rumours, than
in response to any comments or new bits of information.
Mr Malcolm Barr, economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the extent to
which the market had moved on rumours about central bank intervention showed
how jittery it was. 'Sentiment towards the dollar remains pretty unanimously
negative,' he said.
The background to this pessimism is the fear that the Fed is not being
sufficiently vigilant in combatting inflation; and concern that there is
little prospect of the US narrowing its trade deficit with Japan.
Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan in London, put
matters in a slightly different light. He said currencies were moved not by
a complex of factors, but by some simple relationship, 'currently in force'.
The dollar, he said, was 'here because of the weight of outbound portfolio
flows and in particular the sale of dollars by domestic investors.'
Mr Persaud said the dollar would turn 'only when the US investor is
comfortable holding US assets and the US bonds - the largest Dollars
denominated market.' A 'minimum condition' for this would be for US real
yields (currently 4.25-4.75 per cent) to rise above German real yields
(above 5 per cent).
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, sought to bolster the dollar
yesterday, saying that the US favoured a strong dollar. He also said that
the Fed and the Administration shared the same growth and inflation view.
Analysts were sceptical about the likely success of his intervention. Mr Ian
Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said there
were three things the US could do to help the dollar: raise interest rates,
intervene, or talk. So far they were only doing the latter, and then without
great conviction.
Mr Alan Blinder, vice-chairman of the Fed, also said that he did not believe
the Fed was 'behind the curve ' in fighting inflation. 'I think we are very
close to riding the curve, so to speak,' said Mr Blinder.
One ray of hope for dollar bulls was the speed with which it bounced back.
Mr Gunner said this was an indication 'that perhaps the market was getting
quite short.' On the other hand, volumes were modest and there was little
sign of follow-through buying.
Mr Gunner said that with the benchmark treasury bond yield having broken
through 8 per cent, it was possible it would sink quite quickly as far as
8.25 per cent. On recent evidence the dollar would follow, perhaps to the
DM1.45 level.
The pound gained support from the stronger than expected CBI industrial
survey, which rekindled talk of another rise in interest rates by the year
end.
This was reflected in double-digit losses in most short sterling contracts.
The December contract closed at 93.43, from 93.50, effectively discounting
another 50 basis point rise in interest rates by the end of the year.
Mr Gunner said with markets focusing on inflation, sterling continued also
to benefit from last month's pre-emptive rise in interest rates.
In its daily operations, the Bank of England provided Pounds 660m of late
assistance to the market after earlier providing Pounds 273m of liquidity at
established rates. Overnight money traded between 4 7/8 per cent and 7 per
cent. In the cash market, three month LIBOR firmed slightly to 6 per cent
from 5 15/16 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tractor import plan draws fire
of Pakistani manufacturers - Cheap eastern European machines are seen
locally as unfair competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large front page advertisement in a local newspaper says it all. 'Please
stop the import of tractors and save Pakistani tractor industry,' it reads.
Pakistan's tractor industry is fighting a populist plan by the government of
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, that would give tractors imported
from Poland and Belarus to farmers at low prices.
The plan, for importing up to 60,000 tractors by next year at a cost of
Rs9bn (USDollars 88.8m), is set to create at least a mini-boom for tractor
producers in the two former communist countries. But in Pakistan, the local
industry strongly resisting the plan, arguing that it would lead to
large-scale losses for the two larger local producers - Fiat and Massey
Ferguson, which together account for up to 90 per cent of the annual sale of
about 16,000 tractors.
These companies, together with smaller factories that manufacture some of
the spares, are also opposing an official decision to set aside all
government loans for the purchase of imported tractors only. They argue that
there would be no government-backed credits left to allow farmers to
purchase their tractors. Up to 90 per cent of the tractors sold in the local
market in recent years have been bought on such loans, which are repayable
over an eight-year period.
'If the government does not allow us to participate in the plan, the entire
tractor industry will receive a severe jolt,' says Mr Sikandar Khan,
chairman of Millat Tractors, the manufacturer of Massey Ferguson machines in
Pakistan. Mr Khan is urging the government to reverse its decision to stop
official credit for the purchase of locally assembled tractors, even if the
price is higher than the imported tractors.
'Farmers must be given a choice,' he insists. 'If they like our tractors,
they will buy them.'
So far, the government has refused to accede to the local industry's demand
unless they can sell their 50 horsepower tractors for under Rs150,000. But
neither Fiat nor Massey Ferguson is willing to sell these machines at under
Rs230,000, arguing that any further cuts would result in huge losses.
'The local industry should also take its profits down,' says Mr Makhdoom
Altaf Hussain, finance minister of the province of Punjab, which absorbs
more than half of the new tractors sold in Pakistan every year. 'They don't
necessarily have to make large profits.'
Privately, senior government officials contest the industry's claim and
argue that there is room for further price cuts. They also say that a
drastic rise in the price of tractors during the past decade has made it
increasingly difficult for farmers to buy new machines and implements.
However, tractor factory executives such as Mr Khan and representatives of
tractor dealers' associations are confident that even if their prices are
higher than Poland's or Belarus's, farmers will prefer to buy their tractors
rather than imported ones, provided there is no discrimination in the
availability of official credit.
This confidence is partly justified by the well established repair and
maintenance network that has sprung up across this country over the past two
decades, which can serve the needs of Fiat and Massey Ferguson tractors.
Some tractor dealers concede that the new tractors may not have a long-term
future in Pakistan, in the absence of similar repair networks. In a country
where literacy is low and few tractor mechanics are properly trained, there
is little prospect that repair shops will be set up as the new tractors
start arriving.
The controversy has also once again exposed the opportunities for the abuse
of tractor credit given by the government. Senior bankers say privately that
up to 60 per cent of the tractor loans have never been fully repaid within
their time limit.
Evidence of that abuse is also visible at dealers' show- rooms across the
country. Private tractor dealers at offices not too far from Millat Tractors
outside Lahore, the capital of Punjab, offer both Fiat and Massey Ferguson
tractors for up to 15 per cent less than the price offered by the local
manufacturers. In all such cases, the only catch is that the tractors
offered were originally bought under a government agricultural loan and not
meant to be resold for up to eight years.
Local businessmen opposed to the government's plan say that the new tractor
scheme will only further encourage the abuse of such credits. In one year
alone, the import of 60,000 tractors, or four times the number sold here
each year, will allow more people to seek government credits. 'The abuse
will only be more because there will be more opportunities to do just that,'
says one.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International plant 'genebanks'
come under UN auspices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An agreement will be signed in Washington today to place some of the world's
most important collections of plant genetic resources under the auspices of
the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation.
The collections, known as 'genebanks', are housed in 12 research centres in
Africa, Asia and Latin America but are funded by the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research, a network of 43 public and private
sector donors.
The centres concentrate their research on the world's most important staple
foods, including rice, wheat, maize and other cereals. Together they hold
500,000 different samples of plants, which are vital for breeding crops of
the future.
This accounts for some 35 per cent of all the world's collection. They
include 80,000 rice samples at the International Rice Research Institute in
the Philippines and 35,000 wheat samples at the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Centre in Mexico.
Following the signing of the Biodiversity Convention at the earth summit in
Rio in 1992 there has been confusion about the legal status of the
genebanks.
Countries that donate samples to the genebanks feared that they might not
benefit from any breeding improvements to their samples. But the new
agreement legally brings the genebanks under the Biodiversity Convention and
puts donors of samples in a position where they could benefit.
Mr Geoffrey Hawtin, director of the International Plant Genetic Resources
Institute, said the agreement 'resolves the status of the collections held
in the centres' genebanks; it will mean they continue to be freely available
for breeding and use.'
The agreement allows the 12 research centres to become legal trustees of the
collections they house and could pave the way for other international and
national collections of plant samples to be placed under a similar
arrangement. It will be signed at the annual meeting of the CGIAR, which is
being held this week, by the group's chairman, Ismail Serageldin, and
Mohamed Zehni, of the FAO.
'These genetic resources will be invaluable in the application of science
for the benefit of the world's poor,' said Mr Serageldin.

Base metals prices were back on their upward track by the end of London
Metal Exchange afternoon trading.
A strong NICKEL market in the after hours 'kerb' session ushered in
impressive rises in the COPPER and ALUMINIUM contracts in the final minutes,
traders said.
'It was all largely technical,' one said. 'A lot of the longs were shaken
out earlier. Once there was no further selling, speculators were happy to
take it on again.'
Nickel's strength followed a successful attempt to hold above Dollars 7,000
a tonne for three months delivery. Covering and stop-loss orders carried it
to Dollars 7,125.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU farm ministers agree to cut
cereals set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European agriculture ministers last night agreed to reduce the amount of
land that arable farmers are obliged to take out of production from 15 per
cent to 12 per cent.
The move to cut set-aside, the single most unpopular aspect of the 1992
common agricultural policy reforms, is expected to please French and British
cereal farmers who have been vociferous in demanding a reduction. French
farmers demonstrated as ministers began their meeting on Monday, urging a
cut of at least 5 per cent.
The National Farmers' Union in England and Wales had warned that EU cereal
producers could have difficulty maintaining their markets if set-aside
remained at 15 per cent.
Mr William Waldegrave, UK agriculture minister, said Britain had accepted
the Luxembourg council decision on the basis that it would be neutral for
the CAP budget.
The European Commission earlier this month proposed a reduction of 2
percentage points following a fall in cereal stocks from 33m tonnes to 14m
tonnes in the past year and two lower harvests in the wake of the MacSharry
reforms.
The 3-point reduction will apply for next year only, and the level of
set-aside will revert to 15 per cent the following year unless member states
decide a further change.
EU cereals output is expected to drop significantly this year to around 162m
tonnes, compared with harvests of about 185m tonnes before the reforms were
implemented.
The reforms were aimed at curbing overproduction through cuts in support
prices of 30 per cent over three years, and through set-aside. This was
designed to go up or down depending on whether output targets were being
reached.
Mr Rene Steichen, farm commissioner, said strong world market prices, plus
the CAP reforms, had left EU cereal prices higher than desired. He forecast
a net increase in grain output of 3.5m tonnes after yesterday's decision.
Commission officials said the decision could be implemented only after the
European Parliament gave its opinion.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian crop gloom deepens
as drought persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Official forecasts for Australian wheat production were lowered again
yesterday, because of the continuing drought, which is crippling key growing
areas on the east coast. The country's overall winter crop production is now
expected to be the smallest for 12 years.
According to the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics,
the government forecasting and research agency total winter crop production
is likely to more than halve from last year's 28.2m tonnes, to just 13.08m
tonnes. Wheat production, meanwhile, is forecast to be a mere 8.3m tonnes.
If the latter prediction proves correct, this will be the smallest harvest
since 1972-73 and a reduction of over 50 per cent on the 1993-94 figure.
Abare had already cut its forecast for winter crop production several times,
as key planting seasons were missed. It said that the latest predictions
reflected the continued deterioration in cropping conditions in all major
Australian regions and an expectation that rainfall would remain below
average until at least autumn next year.
In Queensland, which has been hit hardest by the climatic conditions and
where farmers are now facing their fourth year of drought, the wheat crop
could be as little as 200,000 tonnes, said Abare. The last time production
fell to this sort of level was in 1970-71. The Queensland barley crop,
meanwhile, was estimated at 30,000 - a level not seen since the mid-1930s.
In New South Wales, the other state very seriously affected by the drought,
winter crop production was estimated at only 750,000 tonnes, some 7m tonnes
less than in 1993-94. Wheat production was forecast to fall by 91 per cent,
to 440,000 tonnes - well below levels seen in the 1982-83 drought. NSW
barley production was put at 135,000 tonnes, one of the lowest figures on
record.
Even in Western Australia, which is forecast to provide the lion's share of
1994-95 wheat crop, Abare noted that crops were being stressed by hot
temperatures and below average October rainfall. However, it said that the
predicted 5.4m tonne crop would still be above average.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Early gains in Treasuries quickly
evaporate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds held close to their opening prices yesterday in spite of a
weaker than expected reading on consumer confidence.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1/32 at
93 13/16 , with the yield rising to 8.043 per cent. At the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 99 1/2 , to yield 6.795 per cent.
After a day of heavy losses, the selling pressure on the long end eased on a
mildly favourable piece of economic news. The Conference Board, a trade
group, said its October index of consumer sentiment slipped to 87.6, from
89.5 the previous month. The data were positive for inflation-sensitive
bonds because they suggested less spending by consumers.
The development offset an earlier announcement by the National Association
of Realtors that September sales of existing homes had climbed 1 per cent
from the August level.
The figure was not strong enough to discourage bargain hunting, with the
30-year bond yield at its highest level in more than two years, but the
overall tone of the market was weak, and the early gains quickly evaporated.
Traders remained concerned about an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to
lift short-term interest rates. The prospect of a tightening, considered
likely near the Fed's November 15 policy-making session, discouraged buyers
across the yield curve. Traders were looking ahead to Friday's estimate of
third-quarter growth amid fears that the central bank is allowing the
economy to expand too fast.
More immediately, the market was facing an influx of fresh supply when its
ability to absorb the new securities was in question. The first tranche came
with the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. As
expected, demand was tepid, but bond prices managed to hold steady. The
action did not bode well for today's auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year
notes.
Meanwhile, the dollar showed only vague signs of reversing its recent slide
on the foreign exchange markets. It inched ahead against the D-mark but
receded some more against the yen. The bond market was bracing itself for
further declines by the dollar as the week progressed.
European government bonds fell in another volatile session, with Germany
leading the losses. Most markets opened lower following overnight weakness
in US Treasuries and tumbled further after breaching key technical support
levels in the futures markets. US consumer confidence data helped bonds claw
back some of their losses, but prices slipped again in late trading.
German bunds ended a volatile day sharply lower, depressed by new supply,
investor selling and the breach of key technical support lines on the
December bund future. After breaching support at 89.50 and 89.00, it hit an
intra-day low of 88.50 before ending at 88.76, down 0.71.
The first DM3bn tranche of a new 7 3/4 per cent 10-year bond for Germany's
postal authority also pressured prices as dealers sold futures against it. A
second tranche is to be sold today via a US-style auction. Although the
paper offers an attractive yield pick-up over bunds, it is expected to draw
little foreign demand and go mostly into domestic accounts.
Dealers reported investor sales amid fragile market sentiment. 'There has
been some liquidation by people who got long after the election,' said a
London bund dealer.
UK gilts were dragged over  1/2 point lower by Treasuries and bunds and
depressed further by the CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey.
Most dealers said they expected today's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction to go
relatively well in spite of the market's weakness, calling for a
bid-to-cover ratio of between 1.5 and 2 times and a tail (the difference
between the average and the lowest accepted bid) of no more than 2. They
were expecting demand to be boosted by the paper's status as next year's
five-year benchmark and the absence of a gilt auction in November.
French government bonds fell by more than  1/2 point but out-performed bunds
as investors switched into France from Germany. The stronger franc also
helped, attracting some outright cash buying, dealers said.
While the December OAT future on Matif fell by 0.60 points, the French
10-year benchmark bond's yield premium over bunds narrowed to 67 basis
points from 74 basis points on Tuesday.
Italian government bonds were also supported by spread trades out of bunds
into BTPs; Italy's 10-year yield gap narrowed to 449 basis points from 465
basis points on Tuesday.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Johnson &amp; Johnson in rare appearance
with Dollars 400m offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Johnson &amp; Johnson made a rare appearance in the euromarkets yesterday with a
Dollars 400m unusual two-tranche deal.
The offering, which received praise from other houses, was split into two
Dollars 200m parts. There was a 7 3/8 per cent coupon, three-year maturity
tranche aimed at retail investors and an 8 1/4 per cent coupon, 10-year
maturity tranche targeted at institutional customers.
Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the three-year tranche met very strong
demand and the spread tightened from 15 at issue to around 14 when the bonds
were free to trade. Spreads on the 10-year tranche stayed around 34 to 32
compared with the 33 at issue, said Morgan.
The rest of the dollar sector was dominated by deals from Paribas Capital
Markets, which brought three dollar issues for different borrowers, each for
Dollars 200m and in various short-dated maturities.
Citic Pacific Finance made an offering guaranteed by Citic Pacific, the Hong
Kong-listed arm of Citic, the Beijing foreign investment company. Paribas
Capital Markets and HSBC were selected as joint books on its debut eurobond,
a three-year Dollars 200m floating-rate note issue at 50 basis points over
six-month Libor.
There was general agreement in the market that Paribas had been selected for
its European base and HSBC for its Asian links.
Electricite de France brought a Dollars 200m two-year deal with a 7 per cent
coupon via Paribas, which said the issue had met strong demand in Europe
from investors attracted by the rare appearance of this strong name.
Paribas led a four-year Dollars 200m offering with a 7 1/2 per cent coupon
from SNCF, the AAA rated French railway operator. Paribas fed this into
unsatisfied demand for the Rabobank deal at the same maturity on Monday and
met good demand, much of it from Germany.
The day also saw two L150bn two-year deals with 11 per cent coupons launched
within an hour of each other, the first when Aa1 rated Norddeutsche
Landesbank made its lira euromarket debut via BNL and the other from AAA
rated Bayerische Vereinsbank via Credito Italiano.
Credito Italiano said the lira market went down after the Norddeutsche deal
and the Bayerische deal was launched into a tougher market.
The European Investment Bank brought a Pta20bn, four-year deal with a 10.9
per cent coupon via Banco Santander, with UBS as joint lead. This was the
first move into the primary peseta market by UBS, which recently upgraded
its Madrid office to a full branch.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: CFTC to relax rules on
futures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has agreed to relax some of its
rules governing US futures exchanges on an experimental basis.
The move, which had been expected, came in response to requests by the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to have the same
regulatory relief granted to over-the-counter derivatives traders in 1993.
The agency prescribed a three-year pilot programme with specific
limitations. The proposed regulatory exemptions will not apply to any
existing exchange-listed products, with the exception of the CME's 'rolling
spot' foreign currency products.
Only clearly defined groups of 'professional' traders will be allowed to
participate in the new, exempt markets, and the agency will require all
pilot contracts, which are expected to look like over-the-counter
derivatives, to be cleared through a clearing-house.
Recognising the controversial aspects of the plan, the CFTC is delaying
implementation for 45 days while it seeks public comment. Derivatives
dealers expect the programme to undergo substantial modifications as a
result of the public comment process.
The agency, in an unexpectedly forceful move, also said it would use the
period to determine if the exemptions granted to unlisted derivatives
markets in 1993 went too far.
Ms Mary Schapiro, the CFTC chairwoman, said: 'I believe that removing
necessary and appropriate safeguards and protections is not the answer to
complaints that there is an uneven regulatory playing field between
otherwise comparable OTC and exchange instruments. In this regard,
re-evaluation of the pilot programme should include scrutiny of the current
swaps exemption, in conjunction with other financial regulators.'
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said it needed to study
the CFTC proposal before commenting.
The CBoT said it was 'disappointed' the exemptions were so limited and
threatened to do battle with the CFTC over the issue when the agency's
reauthorisations comes before congress. The CME, in contrast, said it was
'delighted' that much of its exemption request had been granted.

railway.
Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, said he would decide next month
whether to proceed with the privatisation of West Japan Railway (JR West),
one of the six rail groups that were created by the 1987 break-up of
Japanese National Railways.
He said the decisive factor would be the price performance of Japan Tobacco,
the cigarette making monopoly, whose listing tomorrow has been marred by the
fact that many private investors decided not to take up their rights to buy
shares.
The finance ministry managed to sell just under 60 per cent of the shares in
Japan Tobacco, after private investors baulked at the offer price of Y1.438m
a share, which was set through a pre-offer auction to institutions and rich
individuals. It now plans to sell the unwanted shares in the new fiscal
year, though Mr Kamei said yesterday that he still hopes to float JR West in
the current fiscal year, ending in March.
The Japan Tobacco flop has attracted widespread criticism of the method of
pricing new issues via an auction to the richest minority of investors.
This has prompted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, to launch a
review of the method of pricing flotations.
New Oji Paper, Japan's largest paper and pulp manufacturer, yesterday said
parent recurring profits for the six months to September 30 rose 32 per cent
to Y6.58bn (Dollars 68m) from Y5bn in the corresponding period last year.
Sales were 25 per cent higher at Y270.34bn.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hino Motors recovers sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hino Motors, Japan's largest truck maker, yesterday announced a sharp
profits recovery for the first half of the year and forecast more than
doubled earnings for the full 12 months.
It reported a 39.1 per cent rise in recurring profit - before extraordinary
items and tax - to Y2.79bn (Dollars 29m) in the six months to September.
The group, 11 per cent owned by Toyota, attributed the improvement to an
increase in demand from civil engineering companies, carrying out the public
works funded by the Japanese government's economic measures.
Tougher rules against overloading also added to demand for new trucks.
Hino expects the profits improvement to accelerate in the current six
months, this time helped by the steady recovery of the domestic economy, so
that 1994 will mark the end of a three-year profits decline.
Interim turnover rose by 9.1 per cent to Y302bn, within which unit sales to
the domestic market climbed by 20.2 per cent to 69,820 vehicles.
This more than made up for a 14.6 per cent decline in exports to 15,560
units, a mark of the damage inflicted by the yen's strength on Hino's
overseas price competitiveness.
Hino's net profits rose by 58.7 per cent to Y1.62bn, worth Y4.48 a share, up
from earnings of Y2.82 a share in the first six months of last year. Hino
will pay an unchanged dividend of Y3 a share.

63m at nine months

<TEXT>
Placer Pacific, the Australian listed mining company which is controlled by
Canada's Placer Dome, yesterday reported nine-month profits of ADollars
63.7m (USDollars 46.6m) after tax, down from ADollars 72.5m in the
corresponding period of 1993. Net profits in the third quarter alone were
ADollars 22.4m this year.
The lower nine-month result, however, was due to the absence of last time's
abnormal tax adjustment. At the pre-tax level and before outside equity
interests, Placer Pacific made a profit of ADollars 112.9m in the nine
months to end-September, up from ADollars 76.2m in the previous year.
Placer, which has interests in Granny Smith and Kidston goldmines in
Australia and in the Misima and Porgera goldmines in Papua New Guinea, said
the improvement was largely due to lower operating costs and depreciation
charges. Its equity share of gold production during the nine months was
576,564 oz, down from 616,886 oz in the first nine months of 1993. The
average cash production cost for the period was Dollars 262 per oz.
Placer, which manages the large Porgera mine, added that total production
there was 742,083 oz during the nine months, down from 865,995 oz in the
previous year. This was below expections, and full year production estimates
have been revised to 1m oz. The production figure was dented by lower than
anticipated ore production from the East Zone slopes, and the fatal
explosion at the mine in August.
However, Placer said that development of the West Zones was now getting
priority, to supplement mining production in the current quarter.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: NBHP takes 14% stake in Dominion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and equipment group which has
been debt-free since selling its paper manufacturing and merchanting
operations last year, yesterday announced that it had acquired a 14.9 per
cent interest in Dominion Mining, a smaller Western Australian goldminer.
The stake was purchased in two parts. A 4.95 per cent holding was built up
through market purchases 'over recent weeks'. A larger, 9.9 per cent
interest was then bought from Gold Mines of Australia, a small mining
company which earlier this year launched a bid for Dominion.
North said that it had acquired the latter stake at GMA's entry cost of
ADollars 19.4m (Dollars 14.2m), or about 45 cents per Dominion share.
GMA decided not to press ahead with its ADollars 182m bid for Dominion last
July, after the target company granted NBHP an option to take an 80 per cent
interest in Dominion's ADollars 500m Yakabindie nickel project in Western
Australia - a deal which saw Dominion's share price rise significantly.
GMA's bid had been seen as an opportunistic move, which aimed to capitalise
on Dominion's recent management upheavals and disappointing operational and
stock market performance.
Since then, NBHP and Dominion have also announced that they intend to team
up for an interest in the Vasilkovskoye gold project in Kazakhstan.
If a joint venture agreement is reached with the Kazakhstan authorities,
Dominion would retain a minority position, and North would manage the
interests of both companies.
However, NBHP yesterday played down suggestions that a full bid for Dominion
was imminent.
It said that the purchase 'reflects the commonality of interests' between
the two companies and was also designed to remove instability from
Dominion's share register.
Dominion shares closed 2 cents higher at 42 cents on the Australian stock
exchanges yesterday.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kubota refocuses computer side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kubota is to restructure its computer-related business by largely
withdrawing from hardware and putting more emphasis on software.
The Japanese parent company will dissolve Kubota Graphics, its subsidiary in
California which has developed hardware, at the end of the year. This will
result in a special loss of Y15bn (Dollars 155m), but will not affect
Kubota's forecast of parent net profit of Y19bn for the year to March 31
1995, the company said.
Kubota, Japan's leading manufacturer of farm equipment and iron pipes,
diversified into the computer industry in 1986.
Yesterday, it announced a 13 per cent increase in mid-term parent recurring
profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y14.1bn from Y12.4bn in
the corresponding period last year.
Kubota's decision to pull out of workstation development and manufacture
ends its eight-year struggle in an industry characterised by increasingly
fierce competition.
Kubota has been selling three-dimensional computer graphics workstations it
has developed, but only about 3,300 units have been sold in the past eight
years.
The company diversified into three-dimensional graphics workstations at a
time when it was still a niche market, but competition has since intensified
with the spread of open systems.
Kubota has been pursuing a restructuring effort since the new president took
office last year with a particular emphasis on pulling out of loss-making
businesses.
In mainline business, Kubota saw a better-than expected rise in profits on
sales up 4 per cent at Y340.6bn, compared with a previous Y326.7bn.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matsushita rises 26% at halfway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Matsushita, the Japanese consumer electronics maker, reported a 26 per cent
rise in non-consolidated recurring profits in the six months to September
and said that full-year results would be better than it had expected.
Recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax, increased to Y37.4bn
(Dollars 385m) from Y29.7bn a year ago, helped by strong sales of air
conditioners during an unusually hot Japanese summer and buoyant demand in
overseas markets.
The dividend is held at Y6.25.
The profits rise came on higher sales of Y2,204bn, against Y2,148bn last
time, which the company achieved in spite of the sharp rise in the yen and
sluggish economic activity in Japan.
Operating profits nearly doubled to Y23bn, compared with Y11.7bn previously.
Sales for the full year to next March are expected to rise 2 per cent to
Y4,420bn instead of Y4,320bn. Recurring profits are forecast to reach Y85bn,
up 33 per cent, and net profits are expected to be Y50bn, or 16 per cent up.
However, this compares with recurring profits of Y276bn in fiscal 1990.
Most of the company's main product divisions showed a slight increase in
sales in the latest period, with home consumer products - such as air
conditioners, washing machines and refrigerators - recording the biggest
rise of 10 per cent.
The information equipment division also saw stronger demand particularly for
cellular phones, home facsimile machines and CD-Rom drives.
However, Matsushita's traditional audio-visual businesses continued to
suffer a big fall in sales as consumers turned to cheaper televisions,
videos and audio systems, many of which are made overseas.
The group was particularly hurt by sharp declines in audio-visual equipment
prices, Matsushita said. Prices of some products had fallen about 15 per
cent in the video market and 20 per cent in the audio market.
Video sales were down 14 per cent and sales of colour televisions were flat,
in spite of the popularity of wide-screen televisions. Audio equipment sales
fell 4 per cent.
Matsushita continued to suffer the adverse impact of the yen's appreciation
against the US dollar, which trimmed Y12bn off profits.
As a result of the yen's appreciation, cost savings of Y12bn in the
audio-visual divisions were more or less wiped out, the company indicated.
Overall, however, Matsushita was able to make cost savings of Y28bn through
rationalisation efforts.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: HK Futures Exchange plans
contracts on two stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Futures Exchange of Hong Kong yesterday announced plans to introduce
futures contracts on two of the colony's biggest stocks, HSBC Holdings and
Hong Kong Telecommunications.
The announcement sparked an immediate confrontation with the stock exchange,
which had only been informed of the launch the previous day.
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's watchdog, approved
the product and further agreed to honour the futures exchange's request for
confidentiality 'in view of the overriding public interest for ensuring that
Hong Kong remains the primary market for trading Hong Kong-related financial
products.' This meant there was no public consultation.
However, the SFC conceded that as well as competing with markets around the
world, the two Hong Kong exchanges are in competition with each other.
The stock exchange, which itself plans to introduce traded options on
equities in the second half of next year, attacked the decision to do away
with market consultation, especially given the worldwide perception that
equities futures are high risk products.
A spokesman for the stock exchange said: 'We had the experience in 1987 on
futures products and the introduction of such a product (equity futures)
would possibly increase volatility on the underlying stock, so we think the
market should have been consulted.'
Hong Kong has spent much of the post-1987 years rebuilding its international
repute following the crash, which was exacerbated by a run on Hang Seng
Index futures in the run-up to October and which saw brokers default to the
tune of HKDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 233m), compared with a guarantee fund of
HKDollars 22m.
Mr Ivers Riley, chief executive of the futures exchange, played down risk
management fears and said the instruments could decrease volatility because
of their role in hedging. He also dismissed concerns that followed the
launch of similar products in Sydney, saying the row there was essentially
one over the regulatory scheme and who could launch the products.
'Risk management systems here are light years away from 1987; even so, there
will be special provisions such as limiting the size of the position and
position reporting.'
There will also be margin requirements, although these have not yet been
set. Trading in the two new futures is expected to start before the year
end.
The stock exchange is not convinced. 'If you trade an option the liability
is limited by the option price; the futures liability would be the value of
the futures contract, which would be unlimited,' an official said.

Greater reliability of supply led to higher sales and a 567 per cent rise in
net profits for the Philippines' state-run National Power Corporation
(Napocor) in the first nine months of this year.
Last year the country was plagued by regular power cuts of up to 12 hours a
day. But since then there have been far fewer breakdowns as the company has
achieved reliability of supply and much improved power generation.
Yesterday, the company reported net profits of 5.23bn pesos (USDollars 207m)
for the nine months. Revenues were up 31 per cent to 37.8bn pesos.
Napocor, which still owns most of the country's power-plant capacity,
reported an increase of 18 per cent in operating expenses to 28.6bn pesos.

Lever merger plan

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Indian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Hindustan Lever, the Indian
affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, to acquire Tata Oil Mills
Company (Tomco), a soaps and detergents manufacturer which is part of Tata,
India's largest industrial grouping.
The court rejected five petitions asking for special leave to challenge the
merger.
The main petitioner, Hindustan Lever Employees' Union, had taken the case to
the Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court dismissed its plea to block
the merger in May.
Employees' unions of both companies challenged the merger, after workers
feared they would lose their jobs. They claimed the acquisition would allow
Hindustan Lever to control 90 per cent of the Indian soaps and detergents
market.
Hindustan Lever argued the combined output would account for only one-third
of the 3m-tonnes-a-year Indian soaps and detergents market. Hindustan
Lever's output is currently some 700,000 tonnes a year, while Tomco's is
approximately 200,000 tonnes.
Another objection concerned Hindustan Lever's proposal to sell shares to
Unilever at a 'massive discount' in order to let the parent company retain a
majority holding in the Indian unit.
The two companies had agreed an exchange ratio of shares of the merging
companies, 15 Tomco shares for two of Hindustan Lever.
Hindustan Lever shares yesterday advanced Rs12.50 on the news to close in
Bombay at Rs680, while Tomco advanced Rs5 to finish at Rs87.5.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco's earnings bounced in the third quarter, marking a recovery from
the price war that rocked the US tobacco industry a year ago.
The group recorded continuing advances in sales in its international tobacco
business, particularly in Eastern Europe, and in US biscuit sales.
The rebound in earnings, to 11 cents a share from 4 cents a year ago, met
market expectations. It comes as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, an investment
firm, is seeking to use part of its RJR stake to buy Borden, another food
group.
Overall operating profits rose by Dollars 248m to Dollars 835m. US tobacco
operations, which earned Dollars 382m, accounted for Dollars 181m of this
improvement.
The recovery stemmed in part from a 5 per cent increase in sales, as RJR
switched its product mix towards higher-value brands such as Winston, Camel
and Salem.
Sales growth in Russia and eastern Europe was the main factor behind a 12
per cent increase in international tobacco revenues.
Operating earnings in the food businesses reached Dollars 285m, up from
Dollars 230m, as North American earnings were boosted by higher sales at
Nabisco.
Overall net income was Dollars 216m on sales of nearly Dollars 4bn, compared
with Dollars 76m on sales of Dollars 3.6bn a year ago.

The Italian owners of RC Cement, the US cement company, are to place 28 per
cent of the company on the New York Stock Exchange next month, writes Andrew
Hill in Milan.
The company's controlling shareholders - Unicem, the Italian cement business
which is part of the Agnelli family's empire, and Italcementi, Italy's
biggest cement manufacturer - will place 4.125m shares on the market,
raising between Dollars 66m and Dollars 78m.
Unicem owns 66.7 per cent of RC Cement, and Italcementi the rest, but after
the placing, which is being handled by Lazard Freres, the French bank, their
stakes will drop to 48 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.
This year, RC Cement is expected to report turnover of Dollars 160m. In the
first nine months of this year, Unicem said the US company increased sales
by 24 per cent to Dollars 125m, due to a recovery in cement consumption in
the US, generating a net profit of Dollars 12m.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodyear earnings at top end of
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter earnings at Goodyear, the US tyre maker, reached Dollars 1 a
share in spite of a fall in profit margins. The figure was at the top of the
earnings range forecast by the company a fortnight ago, writes Richard
Waters. Operating income in the tyre business fell Dollars 11m from a year
ago, to Dollars 250m, while sales grew from Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 2.7bn.
The company blamed the decline in margins on pressure to hold down prices,
higher rubber costs and the effects of Brazil's new economic adjustment
plan.
After the end of the quarter, Goodyear imposed price increases of between 3
per cent and 4.5 per cent.
Income in the general products segment fell Dollars 16m to Dollars 31.3m,
while oil transportation rebounded from a small loss to a Dollars 7.9m
profit.
However, due to a Dollars 32m fall in overhead and interest costs, overall
net income rose 11 per cent to Dollars 151.3m, on sales up 7 per cent.

Wilhelm Wilhelmsen, the Norwegian shipping group, reported a sharp rise in
eight-month pre-tax profits, before minority interests, to NKr398m (Dollars
61m) from NKr98m, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The group booked a currency
gain of NKr98m, against a loss of NKr38m last year, and benefited from a
NKr180m gain on the disposal of its shareholding in the Polar Pioneer
drilling rig.
Freight income for the period was unchanged at NKr2.39bn but operating
profit, before depreciation, slipped to NKr449m from NKr469m.
Wilhelmsen Lines, in which the group holds a 55 per cent stake, continued to
develop positively but tanker activities suffered from adverse market
conditions. The car transport business, however, strengthened during the
second four-month period.
The shipowner said business activities, other than tankers, would develop
steadily during the remainder of the year but warned that because of
considerable uncertainties over the development of the tanker market it
might be forced to write down the book value of one of its vessels.

A unit of US chip maker Intel signed a co-operation pact with Jitong
Communications, an information and telecom vendor under China's electronics
ministry, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The deal involves Jitong opening an exhibition centre in Beijing this year
to show Intel networking and personal conferencing products. It will later
be contracted as an authorised dealer for those products.
Intel indicated the Jitong pact would lead to lucrative contracts in China's
national data network development. Jitong is seen as an important contractor
with China's so-called Three Goldens - an urban digital network, dubbed
Golden Bridge; a national smart card credit clearing network, called Golden
Card; and a unified customs administration network, called Golden Customs.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: French insurance group to open
Beijing office

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance groups
which was privatised earlier this year, is planning to begin commercial
operations in China over the next few months, writes Andrew Jack in Paris.
Mr Jacques Friedman, chairman, said yesterday he hoped to open a
representative office in Beijing by the end of the year and was interested
in establishing a joint venture in the country.
UAP has just completed the final part of its strategy of building a
comprehensive network across Europe with the acquisition last month of
Provincial, the privately-held UK general insurance company.
The company had chosen Beijing over Shanghai and other larger business
centres because decisions about insurance are still highly centralised in
the capital.
He said UAP was consolidating its many recent acquisitions in other
countries, rather than looking to further international expansion. This,
however, excluded Asia, where there was tremendous potential growth.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, yesterday opened a representative
office in Beijing as part of a widening involvement in China, writes Tony
Walker in Beijing.
The Morgan Stanley Group also convened a meeting in the Chinese capital of
its 'inside board' to discuss business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific
region. This followed an announcement on Monday that Morgan Stanley and the
People's Construction Bank of China had formed China's first investment bank
to facilitate capital raising for Chinese infrastructure.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nortel benefits from
restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, is
starting to see the benefits of its restructuring and growing exposure to
overseas markets.
Highlights of the Toronto-based company's third-quarter earnings included a
2 per cent improvement in margins, and a rising share of the market for
office switchboards (PBXs). Revenues grew by 6 per cent, in spite of the
disposal of several businesses last year and a substantial decline in
revenues from Canada.
Net earnings were USDollars 56m, or 22 cents a share, compared with a loss
of Dollars 35m, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings were boosted
by a Dollars 43m, one-time jump in investment income.
Revenues advanced to just over Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.88bn. Northern
told analysts yesterday that revenues would have risen by 14 per cent if
divested businesses were included.
New orders in the quarter slipped to Dollars 1.95bn from Dollars 2.34bn a
year earlier. 'We don't view this with any alarm,' a Northern official said.
Customers have indicated that their order cycles are shortening. The company
forecast higher orders in the traditionally strong fourth quarter.
The improved margins were ascribed to cost cutting, and to a more profitable
product mix, such as high-margin PBXs.
Northern told analysts that catch-up work on its transmission software was
now a week ahead of schedule. Delays in this area contributed to a slide in
investor confidence early last year. But its share price has recovered
sharply since then.
The shares were down 50 cents at CDollars 48.50 in early trading on the
Toronto stock exchange, compared with last year's low of about CDollars 30.
One analyst said that he was encouraged by Northern's growing emphasis on
broadband 'information highway' products and on fast-growing overseas
markets, such as Latin America, China and Taiwan.

turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buoyant metal, wood pulp and natural gas markets helped propel Noranda, the
Canadian resources group, to a strong third-quarter turnround.
The group, which is controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, had earnings of
CDollars 78m (USDollars 57.7m), or 35 cents a share, compared with an
CDollars 8m loss, or 8 cents. Revenues climbed to CDollars 1.8bn from
CDollars 1.29bn.
The mining and metals division, which includes a 46 per cent stake in
Falconbridge, the nickel producer, earned CDollars 62m, compared with a
CDollars 10m loss. Mine production has returned to 'expected levels', and
refineries and smelters are running close to full capacity.
Earnings at Noranda Forest rose to CDollars 28m from CDollars 10m. Pulp
operations were profitable for the first time in two years, boosted by
strong markets for lumber and panelboard.
Oil and gas income fell to CDollars 11m from CDollars 16m, with higher gas
prices and oil volumes offset by lower oil prices and gas shipments.

<TEXT>
Kemper, the US financial services group which has agreed to a takeover by
life insurance group Conseco, reported third-quarter operating earnings of
Dollars 32.7m on its continuing operations, which before one-off factors
were flat compared with a year ago.
Mr David Mathis, chairman, said the earnings partly reflected the 'unusual
conditions' and 'overall distraction' of the third quarter, when the company
agreed to a deal with Conseco to fend off a hostile bid from GE Capital.
The figures included a Dollars 40m investment loss from the sale of
corporate bonds and collateralised mortgage obligations, derivative-type
securities which have caused losses at several US financial institutions
this year.
Results were also hit by a Dollars 3m loss in the company's broking
business, reflecting lower commissions.
Overall net income was Dollars 17.5m, or 34 cents a share. A year ago, net
income of Dollars 162.4m, or Dollars 3.63, reflected a number of one-off
factors.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Texaco, the US energy group, reported higher operating earnings for the
third quarter as a recovery in its international exploration and production
business more than made up for the industry-wide slip in downstream refining
and marketing profits in recent months.
Chevron, meanwhile, saw operating earnings drop in both upstream and
downstream operations.
Earnings reports from the big US oil groups this week have generally
reflected an increase in earnings from exploration and production on the
back of higher oil prices. Profit margins from refining and marketing,
although below the high levels of a year ago, have caused less damage to
earnings than generally expected, giving a fillip to oil stocks.
Texaco's shares climbed Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 63 while Exxon rose
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 .
Shares in Mobil, meanwhile, jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , following
an announcement that the company was moving ahead with a restructuring
programme to reduce costs.
At Texaco, international exploration and production profits rose to Dollars
83m from Dollars 15m a year ago (before one-off items). This was due to
higher production of both oil and natural gas in the UK sector of the North
Sea, lower exploration expenses and higher oil prices, the company said.
Upstream income in the US slipped to Dollars 127m from Dollars 138m.
Marketing and refining profits, meanwhile, slid to Dollars 167m from Dollars
200m.
After one-off items in both periods, Texaco reported net income of Dollars
281m, down from Dollars 317m in the 1993 period. At 98 cents a share,
earnings were well ahead of most forecasts.
Chevron, meanwhile, said earnings in upstream operations to Dollars 255m in
the latest period fell from Dollars 332m, while downstream businesses
recorded a fall to Dollars 163m from Dollars 243m (all figures are before
one-off items).
Although operating earnings rebounded from the second quarter, benefiting
from higher refined product margins in the US and the absence of refinery
operating problems, overall profit margins fell short of the strong 1993
third quarter, said Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive.
One bright spot was provided by Chevron's chemical business, which reported
earnings of Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 6m a year ago.
Net income overall was Dollars 425m, or 65 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 420m, or 64 cents a share, in the 1993 period.

<TEXT>
The stock price of Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the country's telephone
monopoly and largest private company, fell sharply yesterday morning after
it reported worse than expected net profits of 7.14bn pesos (Dollars 2.09bn)
in the first nine months of the year, an increase of just 1.5 per cent
compared with the same period in 1993. Third-quarter profits rose by 5.5 per
cent to 2.6bn pesos.
Telmex 'L' shares closed 5.2 per cent lower. The poor results, along with
others reported by Mexican companies, led to a 2.1 per cent fall in the
Mexican stock market at close of trading.
The company's profits were dragged down by a 29.2 per cent rise in operating
costs over the nine months, mainly accounted for by the increased cost of
maintenance and the investment in substituting analogue lines with digital
ones. The rise in costs caused the operating margin to fall to 41.7 per
cent.
Financial costs were also up sharply, largely due to the depreciation of
nearly 10 per cent of the peso against the US dollar, which led to a
reported exchange loss of 978m pesos. Overall the company posted a financial
loss of 582.5m pesos in the first nine months of the year.
Revenues reached 21.37bn pesos in the first nine months of the year, an 11.8
per cent rise. The increase was attributed to the 12.4 per cent growth of
lines in service and an increase in volume of long-distance and local
telephone traffic.
Telmex's cellular subsidiary reported another strong quarter, with the
number of users increasing 31.9 per cent.

Cominco, the Vancouver-based metals producer, staged a strong turnround in
the third quarter as zinc, lead and copper prices rose.
Recent performance has also been marked by 'highly encouraging' exploration
results in northern Canada, Turkey and Chile, which could shift the emphasis
of Cominco's operations from lead and zinc towards copper and gold.
Third-quarter earnings reached CDollars 16.7m (USDollars 12.35m), or 20
cents a share, compared with a CDollars 70.2m loss, or 89 cents, a year
earlier. Revenues climbed to CDollars 294.5m from CDollars 214m.
Lead, zinc and copper prices on the London Metal Exchange were respectively
8 per cent, 53 per cent and 28 per cent higher during the third quarter than
a year previously.
Earnings were also boosted by higher production, including a 71 per cent
jump in zinc concentrate output at the Red Dog mine in Alaska. Total
shipments of refined zinc rose by a fifth.
The most encouraging exploration prospect is a wholly owned polymetallic
deposit in south-east Yukon.
Cominco Resources International, its 56 per cent owned subsidiary, has
announced 'promising' results from a low-grade gold deposit in Turkey, and
the discovery of two 'significant' copper-bearing ore bodies in Chile.
Third-quarter exploration expenses were CDollars 5.5m higher than last year.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Operating income climbs at US
Steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US Steel, the country's biggest steelmaker, reported a 40 per cent jump in
underlying operating income in the third quarter as higher steel prices
contributed to its continuing turnround, writes Richard Waters.
The company, part of the USX group, said operating income (before a Dollars
13m gain from the sale of a coal seam) rose to Dollars 93m.
This represented Dollars 36 for each of the 2.6m tons produced, compared
with Dollars 27 a ton on production of 2.5 tons the year before.
Overall, US Steel's net income jumped Dollars 57m, to Dollars 90m.

Strong domestic and export markets for chemicals, oil and natural gas and
sulphur brought a sharp turnround in Shell Canada's third-quarter and
nine-month results.
Net profit in the third quarter was CDollars 89m (USDollars 65.81m), or 79
cents a share, up from CDollars 1m, or 1 cent (after a CDollars 32m special
charge), in the 1993 period. Revenues for the company, a subsidiary of the
Royal Dutch Shell group, were CDollars 1.35bn against CDollars 1.17bn.
Nine months' profit was CDollars 217m, or CDollars 1.93, up from CDollars
13m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 3.7bn against CDollars 3.48bn.
Cash flow from operations was CDollars 561m against CDollars 377m.
The resource sector provided most of the gain, but refining margins
recovered and a sharp rise in contributions from chemicals came mainly from
stronger styrene prices.
Canada's biggest integrated oil company Imperial Oil (70 per cent owned by
Exxon of the US) posted third-quarter net profit of CDollars 171m, or 88
cents a share, up from CDollars 84m, or 43 cents, a year earlier, with
better upstream and downstream contributions. Nine months' profit was
CDollars 258m, or CDollars 1.33, up 15 per cent from a year earlier.
Revenues were CDollars 6.67bn, little changed.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse says profits were
lower in third period
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit Suisse, the flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group,
said its pretax profits in the third quarter were hurt by unfavourable
financial market conditions and 'did not match the extremely good results'
in the same period of last year.
No figures were given, but the comments in a statement indicated a
continuation of the trend experienced in the first half, when the bank's
consolidated profits before taxes and provisions were down 27 per cent to
SFr1.76bn.
Moreover, there was a significant worsening of the bank's commissions
business due to sluggish securities turnover. At the halfway stage,
commission income was up 10 per cent, but in the third quarter there was a
'slight downturn'.
Net interest income was hurt by narrower margins, especially in Switzerland,
while trading income was 'lower than expected'. Credit Suisse Financial
Products, the derivatives subsidiary, maintained its earnings at last year's
'healthy' level.
Loan loss provisions were lower, but remained 'relatively high'.
At September 30, total assets stood at SFr231.9bn, SFr317m less than at the
end of 1993.

Attributable earnings at Edgars, the South African retail clothing group,
grew 25 per cent for the six months to the end of September to R125.6m
(Dollars 35.8m) from R110.3m for the same period last year.
Sales rose 16 per cent to R1.92bn from R1.65bn, an improvement due largely
to the successful launch of new credit lines to consumers.
Trading profit rose 15 per cent to R235.6m from R204.2m, while financing
costs dropped slightly to R27.5m from R28.2m.
All the group's divisions performed well, with flagship Edgars contributing
the bulk of sales. These improved 15 per cent, to R1.27bn from the R1.1bn
reported last year.
Jet, which is targeted at the lower end of the market, had a very good half,
raising sales by 30 per cent to R236.3m from R181.4m.
Sales House, the group's other leading division, raised sales 12 per cent to
R385.3m from R342.5m.
The group attributed the good results to the improved economic climate after
the elections in April, and predicted that sales and profits for the full
year would be broadly in line with the interim results.
The interim dividend was raised 24 per cent to 56 cents, but the group
announced that this would be made in the form of a capitalisation share
award unless shareholders requested cash.

<TEXT>
Sandoz, the Swiss pharma-ceuticals, nutrition and chemicals group, said
consolidated sales rose only 3 per cent in the first nine months of the year
to SFr11.89bn (Dollars 9.53bn), with reported growth restrained by the
strength of the Swiss franc.
Sandoz, which acquired Gerber Products, the leading US baby food supplier,
for Dollars 3.7bn in August, said group sales growth in local currencies was
about 9 per cent. The group expected a 'sound improvement' in operating
income in the full year.
However, because of weaker financial income, it reiterated its earlier
forecast that net income would only be at about last year's SFr1.7bn.
In the third quarter, group sales were up 5.4 per cent at SFr3.67bn, with
all of the increase coming from the inclusion of SFr190m from Gerber since
August 25.
Mr Raymund Breu, finance director, said the cost of the Gerber acquisition
would not dilute earnings either this year or in 1995.
The nutrition division, into which Gerber has been integrated, saw its
third-quarter sales soar 68 per cent to SFr719m. Mr Breu said if Gerber and
two large acquisitions from last year were excluded, the division was still
growing at about a 6 per cent rate.
The pharmaceuticals division suffered a 2.7 per cent drop in sales in the
third quarter to SFr1.79bn. But Mr Breu said the underlying trend was up 3
per cent in local currencies, slightly ahead of the industry average.
Sales in the agrochemicals division dropped 5 per cent in the third quarter
to SFr175m but in the nine months this has been the group's fastest growing
division, with sales up 10 per cent in local currencies.

profit ahead
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the German truck maker, suffered a pre-tax loss of DM80m
(Dollars 53.44m) in the year to the end of June, but the company forecast
yesterday that it would return to profit in the current year.
Its profitability has declined during the past three years, with last year's
loss following pre-tax profits of DM61m in 1992-93 and DM506m in 1991-92.
The group, the second largest German truck maker after Mercedes-Benz, has
been hit by recession in the European truck market. It fell to a net loss in
1993-94 of DM97m from net profits of DM32m a year earlier.
However, the company has restructured and Mr Rudolf Rupprecht, chief
executive, said yesterday that the group had been operating profitably in
recent months.
Mr Rupprecht said that truck prices had dropped dramatically last year,
cutting earnings by DM300m, while the drop in sales volumes cut profits by a
further DM200m.
MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, a subsidiary of MAN, the German engineering group, had
reduced its overhead costs by DM100m last year, said Mr Rupprecht.
Production fell by 10 per cent to 32,500 - it has fallen by 22 per cent from
41,600 in 1991-92 - while group turnover fell by 5 per cent to DM6.9n.
MAN truck sales in west Europe declined by 15 per cent last year to 26,600
from 31,200 a year earlier reducing the group's market share from 14.8 to
13.8 per cent.
MAN is planning to re-establish the production of trucks and buses in Turkey
following the failure of an earlier venture. It is investing DM20m to
acquire a 33 per cent equity stake and take management control of Manas, a
company in which Isbank, the Turkish bank is the majority shareholder.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak declines further
despite sales rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak, the US photographic manufacturer, announced a further decline
in operating profit in the third quarter and said restructuring of the
company might be necessary in the fourth quarter.
Profits from the company's imaging business, which forms almost its sole
activity after an Dollars 8bn disposal programme, were down 25 per cent in
the quarter in spite of a 12 per cent rise in sales.
Net earnings fell 33 per cent to Dollars 193m, or Dollars 0.57 a share,
excluding last year's restructuring charge of Dollars 353m. Kodak said
charges stemming from the write-down of assets - principally stocks - had
cost 12 cents a share in the quarter. First-time consolidation of its Qualex
photo-finishing business had cost a further 6 cents a share. Before Qualex's
contribution, group sales were up 8 per cent.
Kodak's shares, which had largely discounted the news, closed up Dollars
1/8 at Dollars 48 in New York. The shares are about 11 per cent off their
peak in mid-September, when the market was enthusiastic about the rapid
progress being made in asset disposals by Mr George Fisher, the new
chairman.
The company said yesterday that besides its stock problems, it had been
affected by pricing pressures and cost increases in advertising,
administration and employment benefits.
Mr Fisher, who described the results as mixed, said: 'Our cost management
efforts continued during the third quarter and will carry into the fourth
quarter . . . Kodak will not inventory its problems and carry them forward.
We will emerge from 1994 with a strong balance sheet and a solid benchmark
for measuring future performance'.
The commercial imaging division suffered a particularly sharp profits fall
of 39 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 94m, with margins down to 4.9 per
cent from 8.5 per cent. Performance in copiers was hit by sluggish sales,
Kodak said. Profits from consumer imaging were down 19 per cent to Dollars
269m, with margins down to 16.7 per cent from 24.6 per cent.
Kodak said it was 'hard to speculate' on the size of any restructuring
programme, since nothing had yet been decided. Last year's Dollars 353m
restructuring programme came before Mr Fisher's arrival, it pointed out.

Riunione Adriatica Sicurta, the Italian insurer controlled by Allianz of
Germany, is to raise at least L2,300bn (Dollars 1.5bn) with an issue of
shares and bonds at a deep discount to the market price.
The capital increase will pay for its acquisition of Elvia, Switzerland's
fifth-largest insurance company, which should be completed next year.
Allianz, which controls just over 50 per cent of Ras, announced at the end
of last month that the Italian insurer would buy a 60 per cent stake in
Elvia from Swiss Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurer. Swiss Re
is selling its non-core businesses.
Although the capital increase was expected, the timing, with Italian and
world markets depressed, hit the Ras share price. Ordinary shares in the
company fell 5.6 per cent to L17,882, compared with an opening price of
L18,949 and an offer price of L12,000 a share. Allianz has already indicated
it will underwrite its share of the capital increase.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: RWE shakes off losses at waste
unit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ESSEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profits and turnover for RWE, Germany's largest utility group which is
diversifying into telecommunications, increased last year. This was in spite
of losses in its waste management division and a lengthy strike at its
mining subsidiary in the US, Mr Friedhelm Gieske, board chairman said
yesterday.
However, improvements in the chemical, energy and petroleum sectors helped
offset these losses and would allow RWE to increase the annual dividend of
DM12 to DM13, plus a bonus of DM1.
The group's net profit rose DM41m to DM922m (Dollars 594.8m) while external
net sales, which excludes internal sales, increased 5 per cent, or DM2.7bn,
to DM55.8bn. Exports, which account for 18.5 per cent of last year's
turnover, rose 0.7 per cent, from DM9.4bn to DM10.3bn.
The main growth sectors include the mining and raw materials division, which
grew 3.3 per cent to DM2.4bn, the chemicals and petrochemicals division,
where sales increased 8.9 per cent to DM22.8bn, and the mechanical and plant
engineering divisions, which rose 10.6 per cent to DM6.2bn.
In spite of persistent problems in the waste management division, partly
caused by losses incurred at NuKEM, RWE's US subsidiary, Mr Gieske said he
expected this sector to 'come out of the red from 1995-96 onwards'. He said
the ending of a seven-month coal strike at the US-based Consul Energy Inc,
in which RWE holds a 50 per cent stake, and which cut sales by Dollars 21m,
was expected to lift coal output for this year.
It is in the energy, telecommunications and construction sectors that RWE
will target much of its DM32bn investment over the next five years.
RWE has stakes in Laubag, east Germany's largest lignite, or brown coal,
fields, and Veag, the region's main utility and electricity grid. Mr Gieske
said RWE would supply energy to the eastern states that roughly corresponded
to its 40 per cent market share in west Germany.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Stonecipher plays a difficult
hand - The McDonnell Douglas chief knows how to gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harry Stonecipher likes to play cards. 'Poker and gin rummy - gin rummy is a
good game,' he smiles. Unfortunately, poker sessions these days are a little
limited.
'It's difficult to get five or six people together for a game, but a group
of us do tend to play poker in hotel rooms after aerospace association
meetings and conferences.'
Mr Harry Stonecipher, the new chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, will
have less time for cards in smoke-filled convention rooms, but he may still
play several difficult business hands there.
The US defence industry has been consolidating rapidly as military spending
has plummeted. The challenge is to rationalise in the face of far lower
production runs.
Even big companies such as IBM and Ford have sold their defence arms.
General Dynamics has dismembered itself at auction and Lockheed and Martin
Marietta have merged.
McDonnell Douglas had to stand apart from such deals. Its finances were too
weak for the company to become a buyer, while pride prevented sales.
The result is that the once-unrivalled group is steadily being caught. Its
policy of splendid isolation may not be an option for much longer.
McDonnell is constrained by its mix of products. New aircraft are the
lifeblood of the aerospace business, yet McDonnell has no part in the
Dollars 71bn F-22 next generation fighter for the US air force.
Some of its aircraft are getting long in the tooth: the F-15 is the
company's top fighter, but it first flew in the early 1970s. The only new
military aircraft McDonnell has is the C-17 transporter, which is late and
heavily over-budget.
McDonnell has already written off about Dollars 1bn in cost overruns on the
C-17. Production may be stopped at 40 aircraft next year unless deliveries
speed up and the price tag drops from the current Dollars 280m each.
Mr Stonecipher is the first person in the history of the St Louis-based
aerospace company to be chief executive without the benefit of his name over
the door. He is neither a McDonnell nor a Douglas - he is an outsider. He
will have to win the backing of the board and the workforce for changes,
without the benefit of a lifetime of McDonnell Douglas company politics.
However, he is cheerfully upbeat about prospects. 'This company has a great
portfolio of products, the Apache (attack helicopter), the F-15 and F-18
(fighters) and the Delta (rocket), they stand us in good stead. I would
rather have existing products which we can develop and make more affordable,
than very expensive future programmes which stand a good chance of being
being cancelled outright.'
The objective is to persuade the US government and potential overseas buyers
that McDonnell's current technology is a better bet. To do that the company
is evolving its designs and introducing small-batch manufacturing techniques
to cut the cost of each aircraft.
An F-15 costs about Dollars 45m. If that could be cut to Dollars 35m, it
would look very attractive against projections of Dollars 165m for each F-22
 -an estimate that analysts think will rise.
Mr Stonecipher has short-term objectives, or 'must-wins' in the jargon.
'Getting the C-17 right is absolutely my top priority . . . we must make the
aircraft affordable and deliver it on time. I am looking for many more than
40 aircraft for the USAF and if we can get its cost below Dollars 200m each,
then I think there are substantial export opportunities.'
For the C-17, the crunch comes next July when a month-long trial, partly in
simulated war conditions, will determine whether the programme lives or
dies.
The other short-term priority is the civil division, Douglas Aircraft. It is
limping behind Boeing and Airbus, and Mr Stonecipher is looking for
strategic alliances - 'but not for financial reasons like the deal with
Taiwan', a proposed joint venture which eventually fell apart. 'We are
financially stronger now and are looking for partners in Europe and the
Pacific rim who can give us access to markets,' he says.
That increased financial strength may also increase the potential for
acquisitions. But have all of the best opportunities already gone?
Buying Boeing's defence business would make sense. It would give McDonnell a
stake in the F-22 and consolidate two of the players in the splintered
helicopter industry. But Boeing has little reason to sell. Northrop Grumman
may be too large to swallow and faces a similar shortage of new products.
Lockheed has married another.
If McDonnell's board has any worries that it has missed out, Mr Stonecipher
betrays no sign of them. He is a cheerful and engaging character, a trait
which plays well to the workforce. The habit of wandering in to talk to the
5.30am shift also encourages the image of a man of the people.
Mr Stonecipher has the great advantage that much of the worst bloodletting
has already been done at McDonnell.
With the workforce down to 65,000 from 135,000 in three years, and the C-17
and commercial aircraft operations back on an even keel, the new chief
executive can afford to talk of motivation and building the business.
However, the challenge for his tenure, is to bluff his way out of a
strategic problem with a hand which has weakened, against other companies
which have drawn some good cards. It will not be an easy task.

strategy

<TEXT>
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is shifting away
from loan finance to a greater use of equity products, wholesale banking and
trade finance, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank president said yesterday.
The restructured bank was becoming more of a wholesale banker by lending and
investing large sums of capital in local banks and training staff, he added
at a meeting organised by the Royal Institute for International Affairs but
hosted by the Bank of England.
Since 1991 the bank has approved lending and investments of more than
Ecu750m (Dollars 922.5m) to 40 banks in 14 countries and approved an
additional Ecu225m of equity to 21 investment funds. These two activities
accounted for more than 20 per cent of the bank's committed portfolio of 221
board-approved projects in 21 countries at end-September, Mr de Larosiere
added.
The EBRD began by taking a 28.5 per cent equity stake in Poland's
Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy for Dollars 12.7m in April last year. Its most
recent banking foray was last month's Dollars 35m investment for 14 per cent
of Russia's Tokobank.
Since the resignation of Mr Jacques Attali last year the new president has
pushed through cost-cutting and organisational changes which created a
banking group organised into specific country teams. Over 40 bankers have
been relocated from the London head office to 14 resident offices.
The EBRD annual meeting in St Petersburg in April committed it to projects
in all 25 of the states emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire.
'This means smaller loans, more risk and a greater use of credit lines,
bank-to-bank loans, equity funds and direct equity investment in financial
intermediaries,' Mr de Larosiere said.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: McKechnie rises 44% and seeks acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McKechnie yesterday main-tained its dividend at the same level for the sixth
consecutive year despite announcing a 44 per cent annual profits increase.
The plastics and metals components group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
35.3m for the year to end-July, compared with Pounds 24.5m, and declared its
intention of making acquisitions in the Pacific area, Europe and North
America.
'The business needs to be developed globally,' said Mr Michael Ost, chief
executive. Sharp increases in domestic sales have meant that 48 per cent of
turnover comes from the UK.
Profits were swollen by Pounds 3.07m of exceptional items, the net gain from
the acquisition of five companies, the disposal of three and the accounting
treatment of goodwill. But the underlying Pounds 32.2m was at the top end of
City expectations.
Earnings per share were 27.1p on headline profits and 24.7p on an underlying
basis, against 21.4p. The final dividend is 9.75p, maintaining the total at
14.75p. McKechnie intends to secure dividend cover of 2 before increasing
payments. Cover provided by underlying earnings is 1.7.
Turnover rose to Pounds 420m (Pounds 314.4m), producing operating profits of
Pounds 31.6m, against Pounds 21.7m. It was, said McKechnie, 'a good year'.
This was especially the case in the second six months, when profits before
interest were 44 per cent higher than in the first half. That trend appears
to be continuing.
'The new financial year has shown a very satisfactory and encouraging
trading situation,' the company said.
The profits increase came from a combination of factors: the successful
integration into its consumer products division of Savage, which produced
Pounds 6.5m of operating profits, the strength of the Australian market and
the elimination of plastics losses in the US during the second half.
COMMENT
The wind is now behind McKechnie. With the exception of the UK housing
products market, it is finding trading conditions more congenial across the
globe. There is the expectation of further recovery in continental Europe,
plus a full year's contribution from Linread, its latest significant buy. It
is also obtaining the benefits of productivity drives. So the short term
outlook is bright enough to contemplate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds
42m for the current year. That would produce earnings of 30p, opening the
way for patient shareholders to have a modest dividend rise. The shares are
on a prospective multiple of 14.4 at yesterday's closing price of 433p. This
is not particularly demanding if, in the longer term, McKechnie can build
the muscle to make itself a global supplier in such sectors as automotive,
aerospace and telecoms.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bradford Property down 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bradford Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted property company,
reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.3m, against Pounds 17.5m,
due to lower dealing profits.
The company raised Pounds 8.7m from property sales in the six months to
October 5, against Pounds 19.3m.
Bradford specialises in buying residential properties let at low rents under
regulated tenancies, usually at a discount to reflect the sitting rights of
the tenant. When vacant possession is achieved, the properties are either
sold or re-let at market rents.
The company said that decisions to sell or re-let when properties became
vacant were driven by the quality of properties available. This results in
fluctuations in the level of dealing profits.
Gross rental income increased from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 10.4m. Costs of
sales, including repairs, refurbishment and the cost of properties sold were
Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 10.7m).
Interest charges dropped to Pounds 188,000 (Pounds 641,000). The interim
dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 3.2p, payable from earnings of 5.75p
(8.11p).
Mr Philip Warner, chairman, said that quality residential investment
properties were realising higher prices in the market than earlier in the
year and that the company was accelerating its purchasing programme as a
result.
In common with most other property groups, Bradford does not revalue its
portfolio at the half-year. At the full year it owned properties with a
market value of Pounds 287m, some 60 per cent of which are in London.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Wolseley shows rise of 67%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing equipment,
lifted annual profits 67 per cent after a strong performance from all
divisions and good contributions from acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 were at the top end of analysts'
expectations at Pounds 202.3m, up from Pounds 121.1m. Turnover rose by 31
per cent from Pounds 2.49bn to Pounds 3.25bn.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said the results from
the divisions across Europe and the US had an element of Alice in Wonderland
 -'everyone has won and everyone deserves prizes'.
The biggest gain came from the US, where profits from building distribution
leapt from Pounds 47m to Pounds 86.8m on turnover up from Pounds 1.21bn to
Pounds 1.72bn. The first full contribution from Erb Lumber, acquired last
September, was Pounds 13.5m.
Mr Lancaster said Erb and Carolina Builders, both lumber distributors, had
been 'on a roll for two years' with 30 per cent annual sales growth, but the
rate would slow this year.
In Europe, profits from building distribution improved from Pounds 57.1m to
Pounds 81m on sales up from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.14bn.
The UK, where the group has 444 outlets, performed strongly, but Wolseley
warned that the British recovery was fragile, and that it was impossible to
predict the housing market.
The manufacturing division lifted profits from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 36.6m
on turnover up from Pounds 278.5m to Pounds 390.3m including a good first
full contribution from Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner
manufacturer.
Net debt at the end of the year fell from Pounds 62.3m to Pounds 56.3m,
leaving gearing at 10.1 per cent (14.7 per cent). Net interest payable fell
from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 2.1m. Earnings per share rose from 33.60p to
50.77p.
Wolseley proposes to raise the final dividend from 9.75p to 12p a share, to
take the total for the year to 16.72p (13.30p).
The board, which is offering a scrip alternative for the first time, is also
proposing a one-for-one scrip issue.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Voting plan fuels family feud -
Richard Wolffe explains the upheaval at Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Nicholas and Robert Barr asked their uncle, Malcolm Barr, to stand down
as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the company's fate seemed to
hang on the outcome of a family feud.
Like all family rows, the Barrs' brawl over the leisure and motor group has
its roots in the past. But both camps say they want to modernise the company
with a new corporate strategy and enfranchisement of non-voting A shares,
held almost entirely by institutions.
The brothers, who speak for 30 per cent of the ordinary shares, which enjoy
voting rights, have played havoc with the retirement plans of their
67-year-old uncle.
Malcolm Barr, who is also chairman of the Leeds Permanent building society,
had overhauled his management team and planned to rid the company of its
anachronistic two-tier share structure.
'The whole exercise is very much part of a management plan and obviously I
am a part of that. I am 68 in December and, at some stage, am looking
forward to retirement. 'I think enfranchisement will do a lot for the
company and a lot for the family. I do not think that good professional
management like to be locked into companies with the two-tier structure
because they cannot expand the company properly.'
In May, Malcolm Barr, who speaks for 16 per cent of the ordinary shares,
appointed an outsider, John Parker, as chief executive. Mr Parker in turn
appointed a new finance director, Brian Small.
Last month Barr &amp; Wallace reported a 40 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 928,000 for the first half of 1994 on turnover 15 per cent up at
Pounds 124m.
Two weeks ago the brothers called an EGM to unseat both Mr Parker and Mr
Small. They claimed majority support among voting shareholders, including
the backing of Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman who owns 16 per
cent of the ordinary shares.
The board countered by calling a second EGM to discuss enfranchisement of
the A shares. A document, including proposals for a 1-for-1 scrip issue for
ordinary shareholders, is imminent.
At present there are 2.45m ordinary shares and 9.95m A shares. The plan
would reduce family control - albeit warring - from about 55 to 18 per cent.
While the brothers say they support enfranchisement, they have pledged to
vote against the plans while the present board remains intact.
Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold was founded in 1908 by Malcolm Barr's father. For
years Malcolm ran the company with his brother Stuart, who was managing
director.
However, the balance of family power changed two years ago when Stuart,
father of Nicholas and Robert, died. His sister, Margaret Hook, left the
board through ill-health.
Within a year Nicholas Barr had resigned as development director of the
motor division which his father had built.
In July, the group sold its leasing wing, Trust Leasing, for Pounds 2.15m to
Robert Barr, its managing director. The brothers now run the leasing
company, renamed Barr &amp; Barr. 'To some degree we were suppressed in the
company, probably by the fact that it was a family company and the senior
generation was intact until my father died two years ago,' said Nicholas
Barr.
The brothers' strategy is to split the leisure operation from the motor
division, Trust Motors, and run them as stand-alone companies.
Nicholas Barr would be chief executive of the group, with responsibility for
the motor business, while his brother would run the leisure company.
'We saw the motor distribution business grow in the 1970s into the tenth
largest in the UK and now it stands at about thirtieth,' said Nicholas Barr.
'There is a lot of opportunity, but our feeling is that Trust Motors will
not have a chance to benefit while the holiday business uses capital to
acquire hotels.'
The board, however, says the divisions are complementary. In terms of
cashflow, the deposits on leisure bookings help to fund stocks at the motor
division.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Flotation likely to place Pounds 80m tag on
Ashbourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashbourne Holdings, the nursing home operator acquired last year in a Pounds
50m management buy-out from Stakis, the hotels and casino group, yesterday
said its forthcoming flotation would value the company at more than Pounds
80m.
The management buy-out team, which admitted it had purchased the business
'at a very good price', aims to raise about Pounds 50m from the placing and
open offer.
Funds raised will be used to wipe out the group's Pounds 47.8m borrowings,
enabling it to build new homes and buy development sites with Pounds 25m of
fresh borrowing.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, showed operating profits
from the existing 19-home portfolio increased from Pounds 5.49m to Pounds
6.12m during the 12 months to October 2.
Interest payments of Pounds 5.19m (Pounds 3.05m), however, led to a sharp
fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 1.19m, on turnover up 9
per cent at Pounds 23.5m.
At the operating level, the group enjoyed profit margins of 26 per cent and
Mr Tom Hamilton, chief executive, said its high proportion of private
patients promised further growth.
He and fellow directors - who invested Pounds 200,000 at the buy-out stage -
should see the value of their holding increase to between Pounds 2m and
Pounds 2.4m if the issue is fully taken up.
'It looks a big ratio increase, but the existing shareholders will not be
selling their stakes,' said Mr Lawrence Guthrie of Charterhouse Bank,
sponsors to the float.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: JJB chief to net Pounds 13.5m from stock
market debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Whelan, chairman of JJB Sports, the retailing group due to come to
the market next month, will make around Pounds 13.5m from the flotation.
JJB, which Mr Whelan founded in 1971, is the UK's largest independent sports
retailer, operating 115 branches. The float will involve the issue of some
30m new shares and the placing of about 35 per cent, which should raise
approximately Pounds 22m, Pounds 8.5m of which will be new money. Mr Whelan
and his family interests will retain 63.4 per cent.
According to the pathfinder prospectus published yesterday, the board is
forecasting operating profits on continuing operations for the year ending
January 31 1995 of not less than Pounds 6.5m. Last year the group achieved
Pounds 4.71m on turnover of Pounds 41.2m. For the six months to July 31,
profits were Pounds 2.54m on turnover of Pounds 24.8m. Historic earnings per
share for the year to January 31 1993 were 12.4p.
JJB - which has a key-man insurance policy on Mr Whelan worth Pounds 1m -
will use the cash injection to pay for its recent move to new premises and
look for acquisitive opportunities in the sports retailing market.
Mr Whelan said he would use the proceeds of the sale to invest in other
areas of the stock market.
Remuneration for Mr Whelan and his five fellow directors will amount to a
basic salary of Pounds 50,000 each plus 0.5 per cent of profits before tax.
Impact day, when the shares will be priced, is scheduled for November 11,
with dealings beginning one week later.

In the year to July 31, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds

Mr Mike Wright, chairman, said the improvement reflected savings achieved by
a redundancy programme and renewed emphasis on higher margin products,
especially in the colour imaging services.
Earnings per share rose by 32 per cent to 11.85p (8.99p), and the proposed
final dividend of 5.78p makes a total of 8p (7.2p), up 11 per cent.

<TEXT>
Sunset + Vine, the television production company, reported a jump in pre-tax
profits from a restated Pounds 108,000 to Pounds 1.02m for the year to June
30.
The company said the accounts had been prepared on a revised basis
reflecting changes in the nature of the business from contracted long-term
projects to other areas of television. The underlying performance would have
produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 932,000 (Pounds 505,000) under the
previous accounting policy.
During 1994-95 sponsored programming would represent less than 50 per cent
of turnover for the first time, it said.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 5.96m (Pounds 3.71m) including Pounds 791,000
from acquisitions which also contributed Pounds 167,000 to operating profits
of Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 27,000). In May the company acquired Mobile Image,
the outside broadcast facilities company, for Pounds 2m.
Sunset also announced yesterday the acquisition of Walker-Smith Events
Licensing and Sponsorship for a nominal amount.
Earnings per share came through at 12.1p (1.3p) and a final dividend of 2.5p
(2p) is proposed for a 4p (3.5p) total.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Blacks Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blacks Leisure Group, the camping, sports and fashion group, lapsed back
into the red at the half year stage.
Although still in the black at the operating line with profits of Pounds
339,000 (Pounds 499,000 from continuing operations), interest charges and a
Pounds 95,000 provision for reorganisation pushed the group into a pre-tax
deficit of Pounds 53,000 in the six months to August 27, against profits of
Pounds 638,000.
Nevertheless, Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, was reasonably
upbeat on prospects: 'I do not believe the results fully reflect the
progress made in the last six months,' he said. Accordingly, the interim
dividend is maintained at 0.75p; losses per share were 0.62p (earnings of
1.86p).
However, the second half had started well, Mr Bentley said. New stores had
opened in Chester and Glasgow with others set to open in Worcester and
Kingston by the year-end.
The shares fell 3p to 31p, valuing the company at just under Pounds 10m.

Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, has become a substantial
preference shareholder in Attwoods, the waste management company fighting
off a Pounds 364m bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US.
After buying an initial 1m preference shares at 88 1/2 p last week, Salomon
disclosed yesterday that it had paid a further Pounds 3.2m for 3.64m prefs,
at 88p, bringing the its total stake to 7.3 per cent. This is 3p higher than
the price offered by BFI's offer. and has left many dealers puzzled as to
the bank's motives. Salomon bought some of the prefs from Fidelity
Investments, which remains a substantial ordinary shareholder.
Yet Under the offer, A successful BFI has would have the right in certain
circumstances to demand early conversion of the prefs, or redemption at
100p. once it controlled 75 per cent of the preference shares. While Laidlaw
of Canada has already agreed to sell its 73 per cent pref stake to BFI. at
85p. there is no guarantee that BFI would demand redemption.

<TEXT>
Stakis, the Glasgow-based hotel group, has bought Renthotel (UK) for Pounds
6.1m cash. Renthotel's only asset is the 92 bedroom Harewood Hotel, opposite
Marylebone Station in central London.
Some Pounds 5m of the consideration is repayment of debt. A further Pounds
200,000 is payable in respect of working capital.
The hotel, to be known as the Stakis London Harewood, brings the group's
total to 37 hotels and 22 casinos throughout the UK. The group announced a
Pounds 10.4m pre-tax profit at the beginning of the year, turning round from
losses of Pounds 47.7m after two years of restructuring and disposing of

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: IAWS exceeds expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IAWS, the Irish animal feed and fertiliser group, yesterday reported a 27
per cent improvement in annual profits.
The pre-tax line rose from IPounds 10.1m to IPounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.6m) on
turnover up 19 per cent to IPounds 479.5m. The figures, which exceeded most
brokers' forecasts, reflected good performances by key operations in Ireland
and contributions from recent UK acquisitions.
The group, 64 per cent-owned by the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society
co-operative, had turnover of IPounds 156m in Britain, which included the
first full year contribution from Pertwee and Parson, two fertiliser
businesses bought in 1992. There was also a half year contribution from
Nordos, a fishmeal company purchased in February for IPounds 2m.
The Irish operations, which include the manufacture of food ingredients,
animal feed and fertiliser blending and distribution, all performed well,
according to Mr David Martin, finance director.
Cash flow from operating activities was IPounds 23.5m, allowing the group to
reduce borrowings from IPounds 9.5m to IPounds 1.9m, bringing interest
charges down from IPounds 5.9m to IPounds 4.56m. Gearing stands at 4 per
cent.
Both the Nordos purchase and a IPounds 3.2m acquisition in July of the
Malting Company of Ireland were funded out of cash flow and further bolt-on
acquisitions in Britain, funded in the same way, are being considered, Mr
Martin added.
IAWS is carrying out due diligence on United Fish Products in Scotland, for
which it has bid IPounds 11.8m.
Earnings per share were up 16 per cent to 8.7p; a proposed final dividend of
1.265p lifts the total by 15 per cent to 2.415p.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: EIT net assets fall 4.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edinburgh Investment Trust, one of the largest UK investment trusts,
reported a fall of 4.5 per cent to 326.6p in net asset value per share in
the half year to September 30.
The fall exceeded the decline of 3.3 per cent in the FT-SE-A All-Share Index
over the period and meant that the trust did not achieve one of its
regularly stated objectives.
However, EIT, managed by Dunedin Fund Managers, achieved its other stated
objective of producing dividend growth ahead of UK inflation. It declared an
interim dividend of 3.05p (2.95p) - a 3.4 per cent increase compared with a
rise in retail prices of 2.2 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 5.77p to 5.35p, as a result of switching part
of the gilts portfolio into lower yielding equities in the latter part of
last year, as well as the timing of some dividend receipts.
However, dividend growth from underlying investments exceeded expectations
and the directors are confident of being able to increase the final
dividend.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lep acts to cut Pounds 340m debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lep Group, the lossmaking freight forwarding and security company, has begun
intensive talks with its lenders in a bid to reduce its Pounds 340m debt.
The group - restructured in 1992 in one of the UK's largest debt -
for-equity swaps - admitted yesterday that its core businesses could no
longer service interest payments, which totalled Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 17.5m)
in the six months to June 30.
Mr David James, the company doctor appointed chairman by the banks two and a
half years ago, said the company was anxious both to reduce Pounds 169m of
'dead debts' from discontinued businesses and to refinance National Guardian
Corporation (NGC), its US security business.
'The company is addressing these problems with our banks but it could be a
year before the discussions are completed.'
Lep's bankers currently hold 85 per cent of the equity, which they exchanged
for Pounds 180m of debt two years ago when group borrowings stood at Pounds
630m.
Although the group has reduced borrowings through a series of disposals,
including the Pounds 89m sale earlier this year of Swiss Bank House in
London, Mr James said the core businesses could only afford interest
payments on the Pounds 149m portion of the debt which they used for working
capital.
Their ability even to meet those payments was hampered in the first half by
Pounds 2.92m of exceptional charges covering restructuring, litigation costs
and the security division's withdrawal from its special engineering
business.
Those charges helped cut operating profits from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds
9.95m. Interest payments, a Pounds 2.57m provision for loss on the disposals
and a Pounds 1m loss on the closure of Lep Industrial Holdings together
contributed to increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.66m (Pounds 5.05m).
Turnover was up at Pounds 723m (Pounds 703m).
Mr James said the core security and freight forwarding businesses remained
profitable, but their performance had been undermined by a series of
'disastrous' acquisitions in the 1980s.
'Our strategy has been to get rid of anything which is not fundamental to
our two main activities,' he added.
The group said it would sell its distribution business, supplying mainly
automotive components, 'within a few weeks' and was determined to further
restructure its freight forwarding businesses.
It also predicted that it would agree a refinancing package for NGC in the
first quarter of next year.
Losses per share increased from 0.7p to 1.1p, and with no funds to pay a
dividend, Mr James warned: 'There can be no expectation of a dividend
payment in the foreseeable future'.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Euclidian unveils Pounds 20m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Euclidian, one of the latest batch of corporate vehicles planning to invest
in the Lloyd's of London insurance market, yesterday announced details of
its proposed Pounds 20m stock market placing.
It hopes to attract investors with its high gearing and by participating in
a wide spread of syndicates in 1995. Impact day has been set for November
15.
Euclidian has agreed a gearing and risk-sharing agreement with Centre Re,
the Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary of Zurich Insurance. Under the deal,
Centre Re will make available Pounds 28m in funds at Lloyd's.
That will allow Euclidian to underwrite insurance policies paying premiums
of Pounds 80m, four times the gross capital raised.
Centre Re will buy 5 per cent of Euclidian's ordinary shares.
Euclidian plans to place funds with up to 65 Lloyd's syndicates, selected by
Indemnity Insurance Services, the broker and Lloyd's adviser.
Mr James Truscott and Mr James Stuart, joint managing directors of IIS, are
directors of Euclidian.
Efforts by Lloyd's to inject corporate capital into the insurance market
have not proved easy this year: shares in most of the 12 quoted corporate
investment companies underwriting this year are trading below the level at
listing.
Wellington Underwriting, another planned Lloyd's corporate investor, has
rescheduled its placing pending Lloyd's regulatory board approval of
proposals to allow existing corporate vehicles to invest in others. Impact
day, originally scheduled for this week, is now November 11 with dealings
starting on November 17.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Heart drug buoys sales at Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zeneca, the agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals group, reported an 8 per cent
increase in turnover from Pounds 3.2bn to Pounds 3.45bn in the first nine
months of this year.
Demand for Zestril, its best-selling heart treatment, helped lift turnover
in the pharmaceutical division from Pounds 1.36bn to Pounds 1.48bn.
Sales growth in the final quarter is expected to fall back slightly as the
benefits of the Zestril Incentive Patient Programme - its response to
aggressive pricing by rival drug companies - starts to wane. The programme
prompted a wave of purchases in July and August.
Reporting its first nine-month sales figures since its demerger from ICI in
June last year, the group said the agrochemicals division enjoyed increased
turnover of Pounds 1.21bn (Pounds 1.12bn) following strong sales in North
America and 'an encouraging start' to the season in Latin America.
The group lost Pounds 92m in contributions from businesses sold off during
the past year, mainly in the specialities division which manufactures
coatings and resins.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Guardian Media shows 45% advance to Pounds
16.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Guardian Media group, publishers of The Guardian, The Observer and the
Manchester Evening News, yesterday announced a 45 per cent increase in
interim pre-tax profits.
The increase for the six months to October 1 - from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds
16.7m - exceeded pre-tax profits for the last full year.
Turnover was up from Pounds 122m to Pounds 143m.
Mr Harry Roche, chairman and chief executive of the Guardian Media Group,
conceded that the results reflected the decision to take the full costs of
redundancy and integration of The Observer purchase in last year's figures.
All the company's operations - including broadcasting, publishing and local
newspapers - were showing strong growth.
'We are very happy to have maintained the sale of our national newspapers
without having to resort to cover price reductions,' said Mr Roche.
'But we take a cautious view of the future, given the costs of competing in
the market and the projected increases in newsprint costs,' he added.
In the six months to September, The Guardian averaged daily sales of
398,566.
This was a drop of 1.5 per cent, but sales bounced back in September and
rose to 410,886, representing an increase of some 8.39 per cent.
The Observer's circulation averaged 487,800 for the six months, representing
a drop of 1.88 per cent.
Mr Roche said yesterday the group's balance sheet remained 'exceptionally
strong'.
Further acquisitions were likely as opportunities arose.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: LMS buys shopping arcades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Merchant Securities, the property and investment company, has
acquired Arcadia, a private company with a portfolio of Victorian shopping
arcades.
LMS acquired an 80 per cent stake in Arcadia by providing Pounds 14.5m of
five year redeemable loan stock. The capital will clear Arcadia's bank
borrowings of about Pounds 10m and enable the purchase of further shopping
centres.
In exchange, Arcadia has taken over a Pounds 2m portfolio of four LMS retail
properties across the UK which are expected to be sold on.
Mr Robert Spier, LMS finance director, said: 'We were looking to expand our
retail interests, which are very much larger. Arcadia is going to stick to
this type of business, rather than going into big shopping centres.'
Arcadia was formed in 1988 to manage arcade properties in Cardiff, Walsall
and Stirling, with its revenue mainly deriving from independent retailers on
short-term leases or licences.
The remaining 20 per cent of Arcadia shares will be held by Mr Peter Smith,
who founded the company, and Mr Rod Pearson, former managing director of
Raglan Property Trust. Mr Nicholas Driver and Mr Robert Rayne, directors of
LMS, will join Arcadia's board.
LMS reported a 20 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 22.3m last
year. Its properties were valued at Pounds 379.8m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Metropolitan, Scotland's largest property company, yesterday
announced a turnround to pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.3m for the year to
August 15, against losses of Pounds 1.78m.
The recovery was underpinned by a 44 per cent reduction in interest costs
from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 9m and a Pounds 5.56m gain on the sale of
investment properties.
Operating profits shrunk to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 17.6m) as net revenue from
properties fell to Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 19m) after a Pounds 35.9m net
disposal of properties.
Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, said the company would improve net
revenue by reducing its level of vacant properties.
'We are still running with higher than average voids in the sector,' he
said. 'We do not expect a lot of help from the letting market in the next 12
months, but we still expect to reduce the level of vacant properties.'
The company also aims to increase its portfolio of Scottish property,
particularly in the industrial sector, and further reduce its office
property.
Gearing fell from 181 per cent to 61 per cent as borrowings were cut from
Pounds 144.9m to Pounds 79.2m by the year-end.
During the period a rights issue raised Pounds 26.8m net of expenses. A
Pounds 13.8m surplus on valuation of investment properties also helped to
lift net asset value per share from 81.7p to 99.3p.
Earnings per share stood at 8.82p after 2.13p losses last year. A
recommended final dividend of 1.5p makes a total of 2p (1.5p).

FT  26 OCT 94 / Sprint in deal with US cable companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The race to create alliances in US telecommunications quickened yesterday
with the announcement of a partnership between Sprint, the third largest US
long-distance phone company, and three leading US cable companies.
The partnership will aim to provide local, long-distance and mobile
telephony, and multi-media entertainment and information services. 'We will
revolutionise what comes in over your telephone, your cable TV and your
computer,' said Mr William Esrey, Sprint chairman.
Sprint is to link with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest US cable
company, Comcast, the fourth largest, and Cox Cable Communications, the
sixth largest. The partners, which claim their cable networks run past one
third of US homes, said they would seek to affiliate with other cable
companies in areas where they were not represented. All phone services would
go under the Sprint brand name.
The new venture will bid for personal communication service licences in the
government auction this December. The auction, which it is thought may raise
more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn), has prompted other bidding alliances
such as that announced last week by the regional telephone companies Bell
Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch.
The Sprint partners refused to give details on the scale of the investment.
Mr James Kennedy, chairman of Cox, said the investment was not a lot of
money given the venture's scope. Sprint will own 40 per cent of the venture,
TCI 30 per cent and the other two 15 per cent each.
The alliance is also a response to the recent merger of AT&amp;T and McCaw,
respectively the biggest long-distance and mobile phone companies in the US.
Unlike that merger, it has to overcome the rules against cable companies
competing in local phone services.
Mr Brian Roberts, Comcast president, said: 'The timing (of the venture)
depends on how well our government acts to put the essential rules in
place.' Legislation to allow cable and local phone companies to compete in
each others' markets collapsed last month in Congress.
Mr Esrey said: 'We feel optimistic that we will get national legislation
this year, or if not, the year after.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / There's no such thing as a free risk model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Other people's disasters make excellent reading, and the financial press has
scented plenty of interesting copy in the derivatives markets. Troubles have
afflicted both the financial institutions which originate derivatives - most
notably Kidder Peabody - and a range of hapless clients ranging from Procter
&amp; Gamble to Glaxo Holdings and from Metallgesellschaft to Gibson Greetings.
Writing off the odd Dollars 100m to experience can be painful, but the more
important question is whether there is a serious risk to the stability of
the financial system as a whole. The subject was explored in depth at a
conference on financial fragility which I attended in Maastricht, the
Netherlands, last month. The general conclusion of the conference, which was
organised by the Limburg Institute of Financial Economics (part of the
University of Limburg) in collaboration with Ernst &amp; Young, was inevitably
open-ended: no, but . . .
A positive view, for instance, was expressed by Jerry Jordan, president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Risks are fundamental to the
financial system, and derivatives are used to redistribute them. If the
overall effect is to reallocate risks to those market participants best
placed to handle them, the result should be a more robust system.
Significantly, newspapers which headline spectacular losers never inquire
about the corresponding winners - of which there must be some, given that
the derivatives business is a zero sum game. Often, of course, the gains
will be thinly spread across many direct and indirect counterparties. But
the point is that such profits serve to strengthen the rest of the system.
Such arguments are damaged if too many corporate treasurers blunder into
half-understood contracts, under heavy selling pressure. There is an
expensive learning curve here. We have seen evidence, too, of
over-concentration of risk, among hedge funds, so that market risk may be
transformed into credit risk.
*something in here (HP) *
The banks have responded to the growth of derivatives by developing highly
complex risk models, designed to minimise the levels of prudential capital,
while satisfying the regulators about their security.
Curiously, JP Morgan, an industry leader, decided two weeks ago to issue a
version of its proprietary risk management model Risk-Metrics free of
charge.
At the Maastricht conference Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank
for International Settlements in Basle, was especially cautious about the
impact of shocks. He pointed out Frank Knight's 1921 distinction between
risk and uncertainty. Risk relates to events which, although not
individually forecastable, follow a probability distribution and can
therefore be modelled and provided for. However, uncertainty is
unpredictable and undiversifiable.
Although Crockett did not say so, this might be a reason for worrying about
the robustness of the banks' risk models, which depend upon historical
correlations and volatilities. That doomster, Henry Kaufman, dwelt on this
very theme in a speech in Florida on Monday, warning that such models were
untested in any number of difficult scenarios, 'most importantly a period of
extreme monetary policy stringency'.
Crockett says past examples of financial fragility have often related to
mispriced risk, producing bandwagon effects in Third World debt or real
estate lending. At least it is possible to learn from such mistakes. It is
more tricky to assess the necessary safeguards against truly uncertain
events such as political upheavals or natural disasters.
This year's global bond market crash has been the worst for many years. The
turbulence has not strictly speaking been the result of uncertainty, since
the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates last
February was scarcely unpredictable. But the implication is that market
participants have been able to take ever-larger bets on future trends. The
vulnerability to external shocks may have been increased by the wider use of
derivatives.
Andrew Crockett did not wish to cry wolf. But he was reluctant to assume
that the next crisis would be just one more 1987-style near miss.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Tenneco to buy Germancar exhaust producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, is expected to announce
today that it will buy Gillet, a German automotive components manufacturer,
for cash and assumed debt in a deal valued at Dollars 113m (Pounds 71m).
The acquisition will boost Tenneco's European presence in the original
equipment sector of the components market and give the company a foothold in
emerging markets where Gillet is already supplying customers.
Gillet, based in Edencoben, is Europe's largest maker of exhaust systems for
new cars. It supplies parts to all of Europe's major carmakers. With 2,000
employees at 14 plants, including three in the UK, Gillet had sales of
Dollars 275m last year.
Tenneco is expected to merge family-owned Gillet into its Walker
Manufacturing subsidiary, which produces exhaust systems as replacement
parts in the US and Europe. Walker had sales of about Dollars 900m in 1993,
including Dollars 219m from its European operations.
Walker and Gillet combined will give Tenneco a leading position in Europe's
original and replacement equipment markets.
The purchase will be the third in a series of acquisitions aimed at
bolstering Tenneco's three core businesses - natural gas, packaging and
automotive components. It agreed last month to buy a US power generating and
natural gas development company for Dollars 60m and said it would spend
Dollars 73m to upgrade a US containerboard plant.
Analysts expect Tenneco to report third-quarter earnings of about 74 cents
per share today.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Old row entangles Rowland and Fayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The complicated relationship between Mr Mohamed Fayed and Mr Tiny Rowland -
once friends, then enemies, now allegedly buddies - took an extraordinary
twist yesterday when it emerged that they are in effect suing each other
again.
They find themselves at opposite ends of a court case because of an
indemnity which Mr Rowland's company, Lonrho, gave to Mr Graham Jones, a
former employee of Mr Fayed who defected to Lonrho.
Because of this indemnity, a potentially substantial liability may have been
created for Lonrho by legal proceedings which Mr Fayed initiated at the
beginning of the year for breach of confidence against Mr Jones, former
finance director of House of Fraser, the stores group acquired by the Fayed
brothers in 1985. Mr Jones is defending the action.
Mr Rowland last night confirmed the existence of the indemnity, but said
that he did not believe Mr Fayed would do anything to damage him.
Mr Royston Webb, Mr Fayed's legal adviser, said that in the forthcoming case
he would be contesting the validity of the indemnity. He said that there was
precedent that such an indemnity was void if wrongdoing was proved.
Mr Michael Cole, a colleague of Mr Fayed, said Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland
'currently love each other', so he did not believe Mr Fayed would pursue the
case if it hurt Mr Rowland.
Until peace broke out last October, Lonrho and the Fayeds had been warring
in and out of court for eight years, because of Mr Rowland's fury that the
Fayeds had snatched House of Fraser from under his nose.
As part of his campaign to destabilise the Fayeds, Mr Rowland had allegedly
secretly recruited Mr Jones in the spring of 1990. Mr Jones had left House
of Fraser in January of that year and had allegedly undertaken not to
divulge confidential information. Mr Jones allegedly received payments of
Pounds 555,000 from Lonrho between April 1990 and June 1991. During that
period, he allegedly supplied information to the Bank of England alleging
that the Fayeds were not fit to own Harrods Bank.
The Bank took action against the Fayeds and in June 1991 it forced them to
surrender their management control of Harrods Bank to an independent
trustee. Mr Fayed was furious. He had long suspected that Mr Jones had
worked with Lonrho but could not prove it.
After Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland agreed to drop their court cases against each
other, he asked Mr Rowland for documentary evidence on Lonrho's relationship
with Mr Jones. An associate of Mr Rowland said he could not imagine why he
passed on the documents: 'He must have forgotten the existence of the
indemnity.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Dizzy at 8% but now up or down? - Patrick Harverson explains
why the long bond yield rattled markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Wall Street had been expecting it for some time, when the yield on
the 30-year US government bond closed above 8 per cent for the first time in
2 1/2 years on Monday night, it still sent a shudder through financial
markets. Analysts throughout the US attested to the significance of the bond
yield breaking through that barrier.
Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, said.
'Psychologically, this is kind of chilling to people - it tends to make them
pessimistic.' Mr Lincoln Anderson, director of global research at Fidelity,
the big US mutual funds group based in Boston, agreed: 'It's an important
level - you get through 8 per cent, and suddenly you start thinking about 9
per cent.'
Bond prices have been falling - and correspondingly, yields rising - since
late last year, when the yield on the long bond hit a 30-year low of 5.79
per cent. At first, the market's decline was prompted by expectations that
rising economic growth would lead to higher inflation, which undermines the
value of fixed-income investments such as bonds.
The sell-off in the bond market, however, did not really begin to pick up
until February, when the Federal Reserve engineered the first of a string of
interest rate increases aimed at subduing economic growth and inflation. The
tightening of monetary policy by the Fed, which has raised to 4.75 per cent
short-term interest rates from below 3 per cent in January, was partly
intended to reassure investors the Fed had inflation under control.
The bond market was not reassured. To many investors, the Fed's decision to
raise interest rates five times in seven months signalled that the central
bank was worried that inflationary pressures were building up in an
overheating economy.
At the same time, the markets have had to cope with a steady slide in the
value of the dollar against the German mark and Japanese yen, which has
raised the possibility that the Fed would have to raise interest rates even
more to support an ailing currency. So, when the bond yield closed above 8
per cent in New York on Monday, no one was particularly surprised.
Yet, if an 8 per cent bond yield is some sort of watershed, what are the
implications for US financial markets?
Mr Anderson of Fidelity believes the biggest problem in the markets is not
high bond yields, but the uncertainty surrounding Fed policy, which is
diverting global money flows away from the US. The question everyone wants
to know, he says, is how much higher will the Fed raise rates? 'It's all
about capital flows. No one wants to be in a market where the central bank's
tightening.' Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, agrees.
'There's little reason to expect a turnround in international investor
attitudes any time soon.'
At some stage, however, yields will reach a point where they are high enough
to start luring money away from stocks and into bonds - reversing the
process which saw billions of dollars flow out of secure but poorly-yielding
government securities and into stocks during the low-interest environment of
1990-1993.
While this is bad news for stocks, it bodes well for short-term government
bonds, and short-term yields.
There are also grounds for optimism over long-term yields. Essentially, an 8
per cent bond yield reflects the market's fears of higher inflation. Those
fears, however, may never be realised if the Fed's rate increases begin to
slow down the economy, and with it the rate of inflation. At some point,
investors will realise that with inflation less threatening than feared,
yields are not going any higher.
Mr Brusca of Nikko Securities believes the worst may be over for the bond
market. 'I don't think yields are going much higher from where they are
right now. There are things in the works that are slowing this economy
down.' Consequently, he believes it is time for investors to buy bonds. 'If
you have any kind of longer term perspective, these are world-class interest
rates. This is a point where an economic pragmatist has to say: 'You've got
to buy bonds.''

FT  26 OCT 94 / MPs spark row over risk from 'green' fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An all-party committee of MPs and the UK oil industry became embroiled in a
fierce argument yesterday over whether unleaded petrol poses more of a
threat to health than the leaded petrol it set out to replace.
The row broke out after the Commons transport committee called for a ban on
the sale of super unleaded petrol, and a government review of 'premium'
unleaded, after scientific evidence showed it to be more likely to cause
cancer than leaded fuel.
The MPs' findings, contained in a report into air pollution in London,
overturn many popular assumptions about the use of 'green' petrol. Their
report came on the eve of the publication of a detailed study of the impact
of the car on the environment by the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution.
A principal issue identified by the inquiry was the use of additional
'aromatics', an important component of petrol, in the blending of unleaded
fuels. Aromatics such as benzene have been linked with cancer.
Many motorists using unleaded petrol 'are chucking out greater quantities of
pollutants than an old banger', the transport committee said.
The UK Petroleum Industry Association, representing 15 large oil companies,
denied there was any justification for banning super unleaded petrol.
Apart from the lead, there was no significant difference between unleaded
petrol and four-star leaded petrol. Additional aromatics had not been added
to replace the lead, it said.
The MPs urged that super unleaded, used in high-performance engines, should
be phased out by the end of 1996.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, and Mr John Gummer, environment
secretary, expressed surprise at the criticisms in the report.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Cabinet set to abandon radical council reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government appeared set yesterday to abandon plans for radical reform of
English local government after it rejected proposals to abolish North
Yorkshire and Somerset county councils.
That climbdown, prompted by intense pressure from Conservative backbench
MPs, is likely to be followed today by the withdrawal of proposals from the
Local Government Commission to abolish a further six counties.
The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, had recommended that North
Yorkshire and Somerset should be replaced with all-purpose unitary councils
combining the powers held by districts and counties.
However, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, who announced the
decisions, told parliament that Avon and Humberside, both created in the
last reorganisation of 1974, were to be abolished. It now seems clear that
the local government review, begun in 1991, will be restricted mainly to
undoing the work done in 1974.
Last year, Mr Gummer had said he wanted the retention of the present system
to be the 'exception', and expected the commission to recommend unitary
councils even if in some cases that involved extra expense. But opposition
to the proposals for Somerset and North Yorkshire proved fierce.
In Somerset, all the county's Conservative MPs, including Mr Tom King, the
former cabinet minister, had threatened to vote against the proposals in
parliament. One of them, Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the paymaster-general,
had threatened to resign as a minister over the issue.
The cross-party Association of District Councils had dubbed the proposal to
create a unitary North Riding of Yorkshire 'Shambleshire', while Mr Robert
Banks, the Conservative MP for Harrogate, described the plans as 'a complete
load of rubbish'.
Sir John said yesterday that views of residents in the two counties 'were
not clear cut', and that the proposals had been 'finely balanced'.
While there was majority support for unitary councils in both counties, he
said, 'there was no consensus for any particular solution'.
He added: 'The commission's pioneering work in measuring public opinion and
people's feelings of community has revealed in many other places substantial
bodies of opinion wanting local government left as it is.'
That would be considered in the final proposals made to Mr Gummer today, he
said.

FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley's profits weathered the recession much better than the rest of the
building materials sector so it was only to be expected that its recovery
would be less dramatic. Only to be expected, but wrong. While few other
companies are anywhere near matching their previous peak profits Wolseley's
earnings per share have now topped the 1990 record by more than a third.
The achievement is all the more impressive given that two-thirds of
Wolseley's UK distribution sales go into the still depressed repair and
maintenance market. In the US it has been been boosted by a building boom in
the Carolinas. But the success of Brossette in the difficult French market
proves once again what a successful and highly exportable formula Wolseley
has developed.
Fooled too often by the management's cautious statements, the City is
looking for healthy growth for the next couple of years. Apart from France,
it would be optimistic to look for significant further improvements in its
main markets. The US may have a little way to go and Wolseley could hope for
some upturn in the UK, but margins are already near the peak achieved in
easier inflationary times.
However, Wolseley has shown it can thrive in low growth conditions and there
is no reason to suppose the flow of acquisitions will dry up. Given its
muscular balance sheet and buoyant cash flow, the group may step up the pace
and scale of its deals. But it would be wrong to expect anything
spectacular. That would not be Wolseley's style.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The main problem with the European Commission's rationalisation plans for
the steel industry was timing. The moment to cut capacity is when an
industry heads into recession, not when it is clambering back to
profitability. No management will cut capacity when its plants, however
inefficient, are set to generate cash.
Even so, the Commission's failure to tackle the industry's structural
overcapacity will have a long-term cost. The pain during the next trough is
likely to be that much worse. Continuing excess capacity will once again
drive prices so low that steelmakers will be unable to cover their fixed
costs. But next time the sector will find it more difficult to export its
way out of trouble, particularly to the US where manufacturers appear
increasingly competitive. It will also need to cope with imports from
eastern European suppliers which should have sorted out their difficulties
by then.
If Europe's industry is ever to become self-supporting and provide a decent
return on capital, the Commission will have to reject demands for state
subsidies next time round. Aid may preserve politically sensitive jobs, but
it perpetuates inefficient production and costs huge sums to the tax-payers.
Most importantly, subsidies threaten free trade. If Europe's steel industry
is to prosper it must export, especially to Asia where growth is strong and
capacity shortages exist. Asian doors will be justifiably barred to a
subsidised European steel sector.

<TEXT>
The scale of the UK's personal pensions scandal continues to shock. It now
looks as though about 850,000 people were persuaded to take out personal
pensions instead of staying with or joining company pension schemes.
Compensation for such 'opt-outs' could exceed that for those who stopped
working for a company and then transferred a lump sum out of its scheme.
Nobody knows how big the total compensation bill will be. But the figures of
Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn being bandied around do not look ridiculous.
Many life companies will be able to shield their shareholders from the worst
of the damage. The bulk of the compensation may be paid from 'with-profit'
funds, meaning policy-holders will bear the pain. Unit-linked groups could
be more at risk, as it is harder to see how they could dip into some of
their investors' funds to pay compensation to others.
The cost of compensation will be only part of the industry's agony. It will
face an administrative nightmare sorting out which policy-holders qualify
for compensation. Each case will require detailed individual investigation.
Disputes involving lawyers cannot be ruled out. There will also be long-term
damage to the industry's reputation. Sales of pensions and other life
policies have already fallen sharply. In future, sales people will need to
put in much greater effort if they are not to fall foul of the regulator's
'best advice' rules. With full commission disclosure due next year, the
industry may be unable to pass on the costs of good advice.

FT  26 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint's triple jump
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time since the break-up of AT&amp;T, US consumers will be able to
choose the same brand for local, long-distance and mobile phone calls. That,
at any rate, is the objective of Sprint's alliance with three of the largest
US cable television groups. Actually achieving this aspiration will not be
easy. Massive investment and regulatory changes will be needed before the
cable television companies' networks can provide local telephone services.
Similarly, the partners have only a small role in mobile communications,
though this could change if they are successful in winning licences in the
US government's forthcoming auction.
Sprint's alliance is a ground-breaking event in the fast-changing US
communications landscape. The Baby Bells, the dominant forces in the local
telephone market, are the most vulnerable. Not only could they lose local
customers to Sprint's venture; their high margins for providing local access
to long-distance operators will be under threat. The Bells are likely to
respond by redoubling their efforts to be allowed to enter the television
and long-distance markets, while building their own alliances in mobile
communications.
Sprint's long-distance rivals may be under pressure to respond too. Much
depends on whether consumers would really prefer to buy packages of local,
long-distance and mobile services from a single source. If Sprint is right,
AT&amp;T will need to add a local offering to its existing long-distance and
mobile services. MCI, whose attempts to knit together mobile alliances have
so far floundered, will have even further to go.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Rooting out corruption
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not before time, Mr John Major has perceived the need for a comprehensive
inquiry into standards in British public life. The prime minister's
announcement in the House of Commons yesterday is welcome, but it might
better have been made sooner. Over the past few days two of his junior
ministers have been obliged to resign, following allegations that they
received payments in return for political favours. If that was the whole
story, Mr Major might be said to have acted both decisively and swiftly.
In terms of public disquiet, however, these falls from grace were merely the
latest in a long series of incidents, some of them similar, some of a
different nature. Conservative politicians in particular have been put under
the spotlight, and too often found wanting, since the 'back to basics'
campaign of a year ago, and indeed before that. There has been a growing
perception, fed by media inquiries and opposition statements, that after 15
years in office some prominent members of the governing party are behaving
with less care or good sense than they should.
This must be seen in perspective. The British inclination is to believe that
corrupt behaviour happens in other countries, but not at home. A more
accurate proposition is that malfeasance uncovered elsewhere is often on a
far larger scale than in Britain, but that the trade-off of cash for favours
has become universal.
Relatively small
The corruption revealed in Italy was systemic. It led to the overthrow of
the long-established parties, and the election of Mr Berlusconi. Large sums
of money, and large banks, are implicated in tales of corruption in Spain.
The allegations of malpractice that recently forced two French ministers to
resign involve greater sums, and more obvious departures from probity, than
anything said in the recent British cases. Mr Edouard Balladur has had to
contend with allegations that his ministers took serious money; Mr Major
that junior members of his government dabbled in peanuts.
The prime minister has been forced to take action because of an accumulation
of relatively small incidents of corruption, most of it rather petty and
some of it involving the exercise of political patronage rather than the
receipt of cash. Questionable individuals donate money to Conservative
funds. Appointments to public bodies are not listed; the suspicion grows
that they are politically motivated. The Scott inquiry has yet to report on
the exercise of ministerial and official discretion in the matter of arms
sales to Iraq.
Independent scrutiny
Mr Major's announcement yesterday addresses some, but not all, of the many
such issues that have arisen over the past few years. The standing committee
he is to set up will 'examine current concerns about standards of conduct of
all holders of public office, including arrangements relating to financial
and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in
present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards
in public life'.
To judge from his remarks in the House, Mr Major does not envisage that the
new committee, to be chaired by Lord Nolan, will examine the sources of
payments to political parties. It should. Mr Major said nothing about
publishing a list of members of quangos, or subjecting their appointments to
independent scrutiny. He should do so now.
Lord Nolan is not to examine the charges against individual ministers; that
inquisition will take place, in camera, in a parliamentary committee. It
should be held in public, even though some of the evidence may come from Mr
Mohamed Fayed, an Egyptian-born financier, whose motives were put in
question yesterday by both the prime minister and the leader of the
opposition.
Otherwise, as Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said, 'there will be
justifiable public concern that the general inquiry is being used to sweep
the particular allegations from public view, when it is these allegations
that have given rise to the public concern'.
Mr Major's announcement may take some of the heat off the government. The
inclusion of local authorities in its remit makes it likely that some Labour
councils will be shown to be corrupt. But he needs to do more if he is to
restore public confidence.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Peace prospects frayed at the edges: Palestinian grievances
are increasing tensions again in the Middle East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, will be
conspicuous by his absence at today's triumphant signing of the
Israel-Jordan peace treaty in the presence of US President Bill Clinton.
Jordan, which is at loggerheads with the PLO over rival claims to the
Islamic sites in Arab East Jerusalem, did not include the Palestinian leader
among the 5,000 guests. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, went
further, telling Mr Arafat, officially and publicly, that he was 'not
welcome'.
The landmark accord signed by Israel and the PLO last September marked a
turning point in Middle East peace. Since then, Israeli peace with Syria and
Lebanon has moved within grasp; Morocco and Tunisia have established formal
ties with the Jewish state; the Arab economic boycott of Israel has been
eroded; and, on Sunday, political and business leaders from Israel, the Arab
world, the US, Europe and Japan will meet in Casablanca to take the first
step towards creating a Middle East common market.
But the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that made all this possible is
in serious trouble.
Against the backdrop of economic deterioration in the Gaza Strip and delays
in the peace negotiations, Palestinian discontent is rising, and there has
been a series of horrific attacks on Israelis by Palestinian Islamic
guerrillas.
Indeed, Mr Arafat's advisers are now openly questioning the feasibility of
the peace process. 'The situation is very fragile and sensitive at the
moment in terms of stability. Anything could happen,' said Mr Nabil Abu
Irdainah, a senior official in Mr Arafat's office. 'We still hope it will
work, but it could fail.'
Israel and the PLO knew that their peace agreement was a risky venture. In
return for Israeli recognition of the PLO and a commitment to a five-year
process of negotiations, Mr Arafat settled for limited autonomy in a tiny,
impoverished part of the land claimed by Palestinians. He hoped he could
eventually win the state the Palestinians want, in all of the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank including Arab East Jerusalem.
Palestinians were sceptical about Mr Arafat's deal, which seemed to
surrender the three burning causes that have sustained the Palestinian
struggle since 1948: the return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees; the
recovery of all land occupied by Israel; and a Palestinian state with
Jerusalem as its capital. But a slim majority gave the veteran PLO leader
the benefit of the doubt.
The signatories to the deal hoped that this fragile Palestinian support
would be consolidated as the peace process gained momentum, with Mr Arafat
gradually expanding his rule across the West Bank and holding elections to
pave the way for discussions on statehood, Jerusalem and refugees. Support
would also grow, they believed, as Palestinians experienced a speedy change
in their economic situation.
However, 13 months after the signing of the agreement, ordinary Palestinians
have seen little evidence of the fruits of peace. The peace process is six
to nine months behind schedule. Israel has reneged on promises to release
thousands of Palestinian prisoners and appears reluctant to take the next
big step in the process: redeployment of Israeli troops in the occupied West
Bank to allow Palestinian elections.
Israel is also insisting on complex security arrangements to protect the
120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and pushing the PLO to bar the
Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement from participating in the elections. The
poll should have been held last July, but now seems unlikely before
mid-1995.
Israeli control over the pace of the peace negotiations and the nature of
any concessions to the PLO is fuelling support for Mr Arafat's opponents,
who maintain that Israel never intended to hand over the West Bank. 'The
delay in the application of the agreement only helps to inflame the
situation, and will help extremists to explode the peace process,' said Mr
Yassir Abed-rabbo, who holds the Palestinian portfolio for culture.
And on the economic front, the chaotic transition from Israeli to PLO rule
in the Gaza Strip may even have caused a downturn.
In an economy with 50 per cent unemployment and years of infrastructure
neglect, only a fraction of the Dollars 720m of emergency aid promised by
international donors and the World Bank for 1994 has been released. The UN
Works and Relief Agency has spent Dollars 52m on projects since September
last year, but the only other large project under way is a Gaza clean-up
campaign, funded by Japan and the European Union, which has created just
3,000 jobs. A Dollars 128m emergency housing project is slowly taking shape.
As a recent UN internal memorandum observed: 'Despite its significance,
almost no significant investment activity has occurred in the Gaza Strip
since (Israeli) redeployment.' The private sector remains unwilling to
inject capital, the UN says, 'into an economy where the political situation
remains unstable and no regulatory framework yet exists'.
Recent evidence of irregular business deals in cement, petroleum and
telecommunications, negotiated by a coterie around Mr Arafat without open
public bidding, has also deterred the private sector.
The World Bank blames the PLO's lack of accountability and Mr Arafat's
refusal to delegate economic decision-making for these problems. There has
been political infighting in the PLO, as four senior officials have competed
for control over economic policy, with Mr Arafat as the only court of
appeal.
The PLO blames the World Bank and other donors for bureaucracy and failure
to see the political imperatives of speedy disbursement of aid. 'We are
suffering from donor fatigue, donor myopia and donor arterial sclerosis,'
said Mr Nabil Shaath, one of the Palestinians responsible for aid
negotiations. 'Unless you burn yourself completely, like Rwanda or Somalia,
it seems donors are not interested.'
Some bilateral donors believe the truth lies in the middle. While they
support the World Bank in its criticisms of the PLO, they say the bank has
concentrated too much on long-term projects and has proved incapable of
finding alternative ways to release aid and to work with the PLO.
Mr Terje Roed Larsen, UN under-secretary general co-ordinating aid to the
Palestinians, said: 'The UN and World Bank agree that it is now acutely
necessary to have both a short-term and long-term focus and to put in motion
high-impact job-creating projects, because if there is no significant
improvement of living conditions in the next six to eight months, the
support and legitimacy for the process and the Palestinian authority will
evaporate.'
Matters have been made worse by Israel sealing the borders with the Gaza
Strip and West Bank at least four times since September last year. The most
recent closure, imposed last Wednesday after the Hamas suicide bombing of a
Tel Aviv bus, which killed 22 Israelis, is still in place.
The closure has put 65,000 Palestinian migrant labourers, whose income forms
the backbone of the dependent Palestinian economy, out of work. It will also
hit Palestinian exports to Israel and Palestinian Treasury revenue, as well
as deterring investors and tourists.
These costs, together with the continuing economic hardship, appear to be
strengthening the hand of Hamas. Mr Mahmoud Zohar, the organisation's
leading Gaza spokesman, welcomed the return of Mr Arafat and the PLO to Gaza
because their failures, he said, would encourage Palestinians to turn to
Hamas. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he said.
Many Palestinians refuse to condemn the recent Hamas attacks, in view of the
continuing Israeli occupation and Mr Arafat's apparent weakness. The
simmering tension between the two rival Palestinian groups has moved into
open confrontation, with Hamas challenging the PLO for the political
leadership of the Palestinian cause.
Mr Arafat dares not move against Hamas while he has so few political and
economic gains from the peace process and fears the eruption of civil war.
'We did not make peace with Israel to make a civil war among our own
people,' said Mr Shaath. 'Hamas cannot be defeated by security alone. We
need a judicious mixture of political and economic change.'
But Israel, backed by the US, is insisting that Mr Arafat deal a severe blow
to Hamas, and implying that further progress in the peace talks will depend
on a crackdown on Islamic guerrillas.
Mr Arafat's dilemma, and the possibility of a break-down in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process, could yet derail progress towards peace
in the Middle East. Despite today's signing with Jordan, many Arab states
are holding back or making further ties with Israel conditional on progress
on the Palestinian issue. Until that happens, hopes of wide-ranging peace in
the region look far-fetched.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Personal View: Treasury reform - low on culture shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TYRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Treasury, Whitehall's most powerful civil service department, has
gone back to first principles to justify its existence or, more accurately,
its running costs. A penetrating report published last week recommends
refocusing the department's work and a radical shake-up in its organisation.
The report should be judged on whether it leads to a stronger Treasury. A
strong central department is needed to fend off ever more powerful special
pleading by vested interest groups, often articulated by other parts of
Whitehall.
There is certainly some modernising to cheer in the report. For the first
time the Treasury has set itself objectives. It will concentrate on core
activities and get out of others, such as checking on diplomats'
cost-of-living allowances in Bogota or running civil service pensions.
The report recommends removing much duplication of work done by others. It
will reduce senior staff numbers by more than a quarter.
Not bad. But a key test of this report is how far it enables the Treasury to
change its culture. Does it address the common criticisms of the department
that it is short-termist in outlook and insular in making decisions?
To deal with short-termism, the report recommends the creation of a strategy
group. I am not sure this is the answer. In my experience, there was no
shortage of willingness or capacity among senior staff to think longer term,
particularly when ministers demanded it. The problem was that so many were
engaged in dealing with short-term crises that they rarely had time to take
the longer view.
Time will tell whether those advised by the strategy group will find
themselves swamped by events, leaving the group's elegant reports to
languish in their pending trays. The report distinguishes more clearly the
roles of senior grades, and this may leave scope for long-term thinking by
the top layers, who currently spend too much time second-guessing
subordinates.
Insularity is a bigger problem. I was astonished to discover that the
Treasury often worked out important reforms (on pensions deregulation, for
example) with little input from those with significant working experience of
the field.
Here the culture needs a fundamental change, with more people brought in
from outside. Far more cross-fertilisation is needed between the Treasury
and other professions.
Ultimately that could mean differential pay for the same work to attract
suitable outsiders. Providing posts for them would also erode the
presumption that civil servants can expect a lifetime career.
This is a bridge too far for the Treasury. True, the seven new 'directors'
created by the report will be given enormous freedom, including power to
recruit on short-term contracts. But the commitment to a lifetime service
wins out: the report makes clear that short-term contracts are 'unlikely in
our view to be a significant feature of a restructured Treasury'. It seems
particularly odd to cling to the lifetime principle when the slimming at the
top sends such a clear message to younger staff that there will be far fewer
slots for them later on.
Nonetheless, there are hopeful signs of greater openness in Treasury work,
with far more secondments to industry. There is also a long overdue proposal
that senior Treasury mandarins should have more experience of the areas of
public expenditure they are responsible for (whether it is industry,
schools, hospitals or whatever).
Although the system of controlling public expenditure looks at risk from the
proposals to reduce Treasury interference in departments and agencies, it is
probably safe. The present system is certainly due for an overhaul: it
requires the Treasury to approve minutiae such as the amount spent on
leaving-gifts and 'novel' office parties. A little devolution on this close
monitoring might leave the Treasury with more time to weigh up the
short-term cost of spending against its long-term economic benefits.
The report sensibly makes clear that the Treasury is going to give up these
nit-picking powers only when departments demonstrate a greater willingness
to share management and financial information with them. That is an
essential safeguard. Departments are not like business profit centres, and
decentralisation could all too easily lead to loss of spending control.
The jury is out on these reforms. In some ways they do not go far enough.
They may not be implemented. But at least they may prompt cuts in the upper
echelons elsewhere in the civil service. A good place to start would be
Whitehall's other ivory tower: the Foreign Office.

Lawson and John Major

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hercules cleaned the Augean stables by diverting a river through them.
Sadly, there is no comparable short cut for Britain's Securities and
Investments Board (SIB) in dealing with the mis-selling of personal
pensions. Moreover the potential scale of this extraordinary regulatory
disaster continues to increase.
The SIB's initial assumption was that the problem was primarily concerned
with poor pensions advice being given to people on leaving their jobs or on
being made redundant. Many were transferring into personal pensions when
they would have been better off taking deferred benefits from more generous
occupational schemes. It has since become increasingly apparent that the
biggest problem may be to do with two different groups: those who were
advised to opt out of occupational schemes while remaining in the same
employment, or who took out personal pensions instead of joining more
generous occupational schemes for which they were eligible.
Given that personal pensions are a much more expensive form of provision
than defined benefit occupational schemes and offer an uncertain future
return, the circumstances in which they are likely to be the best choice for
those other than the self-employed are limited. Yet consulting actuary Bacon
and Woodrow estimates that there were more than 850,000 employed people who
made such a choice on the advice of personal pensions salesmen. It is hard
to believe that a majority of them will not have suffered actual or
potential loss as a result.
Inevitable pressure
To its credit, the SIB shows no sign of backsliding in its detailed
proposals to provide redress, despite inevitable pressure from elements of
the financial services industry. Clearly it will be helped if occupational
pension schemes are prepared to take back those who have been ill-advised.
The National Association of Pension Funds is sensibly urging this course on
its members and some public sector schemes have already accepted the
argument. Yet the SIB has no jurisdiction over pension fund trustees. And
even where they are prepared to act, companies responsible for mis-selling
will have to meet the 'fair' cost of reinstatement. Where no reinstatement
is possible, redress will be offered direct to the investor.
Compensation will only be required where there are actual or potential
losses and poor advice can be seen to have played a causal role. It will not
be given in the case of losses where the investor understood the character
and size of the risks being run.
Calculating redress
The SIB's specific methods of calculating redress inevitably involve big
assumptions in valuing benefits - for example, in relation to future salary
increases, discretionary benefits and so forth. But these have been reviewed
by the government actuary and do not look unreasonable overall. Since part
of the object of the exercise is anyway to minimise the need for the victims
to go to court, the SIB has had an incentive to ensure that the redress is
adequate.
There are questions about the adequacy of the coverage of the review of
personal pension sales. There will, for example, be no automatic requirement
for a review of advice to those who had the option to join occupational
schemes but chose personal pensions instead. The larger worries concern,
first, the thoroughness with which companies will go about the monumental
task of reviewing their own mis-selling; and, second, the quality of
monitoring and enforcement by self-regulatory organisations such as the
newly formed Personal Investment Authority.
The cost for the banking and insurance sectors will be huge. The bill, for
which outside estimates range as high as Pounds 2bn, anyway results from
clear breaches of the regulatory standards in force at the time by the
industry at large. For those with efficient systems the problem will be
readily manageable within the SIB's timetable, which aims for a full
solution by the end of 1996. For the weaker insurance companies, that
deadline looks pious. The coincidence of this review with the SIB's new
disclosure rules looks like one more nail in their coffin.

Picture the scene. A bunch of central bankers and finance ministers shooting
the rapids on Wyoming's Snake River last summer, when certain members of the
party start to go adrift.
A whiff of panic spreads among the remaining members of the world's
financial community, as they realise that they may not be able to walk on
water after all. Cue Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, who turns to his
fellow paddler, Nigel Lawson, Britain's ex-chancellor of the exchequer, with
the ultimate reassurance: 'The Bundesbank is with you.' Panic over.
Well, that's Tietmeyer's version.

'Persistence pays off' might be the new school motto for St Aidan's high
school in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire. Increasingly strapped for cash, the
school scouted round for sponsors. Alan Leeson, the headmaster, approached
Canatxx Energy Ventures, a Houston-based company that is building a
gas-fired power station in nearby Fleetwood.
It took 21 transatlantic phone calls before the enterprising head, who is
also an Anglican priest, got through to Dennis Volter, the company's
president. 'He came after me and didn't give up. That impressed me,' says
Volter, who eventually stumped up Pounds 50,000, matching a similar amount
from British Aerospace.
Though maybe Volter was also swayed by family history - he was born in
Liverpool and still has relatives in Lancashire.

Religion is not a growth business. The Federation of Synagogues is following
the Church of England's lead in shedding under-used assets. Two synagogues
in the East End of London are up for sale as second and third- generation
Jewish immigrants desert the area for the suburbs. While the federation is
willing to sell to other faiths, it also has a duty to accept the highest
bid - so God might be outbid by Mammon.
'Twas ever thus. The first Methodist chapel, used by John Wesley from 1743,
is about to be turned into Covent Garden offices; previous tenants include
the London City Ballet and the Tiller Girls, the high-stepping entourage of

The dangers of drinking on duty, continued. The CNPF, the French employers'

financial information to the market. A very worthy tome, indeed - nestling
within the comments on relations with analysts and the press is 'A risk
often ignored: cocktails'.
Les cocktails, it seems, offer pitfalls for the unwary, and not just for
purists guarding the language. Apparently there is a risk of divulging
sensitive information when having a drink after a press conference. Sacre

Lord Howe may be the last of the Thatcher government's troika to publish his
memoirs, but he could be the first to stage a political comeback - if you
listen to Sir Robin Day, the veteran TV interviewer. Sir Robin, attending
the launch of Lord Howe's book, confidently predicted that Howe would soon
be back in government as Lord Chancellor, giving it some 'much-needed
bottom'.
Then again, Sir Robin might be a bit biased. The two of them go back a long
way. Both were called to the Bar on the same evening in 1952 and both stood
for Parliament in 1959. Sir Robin and Geoffrey Howe failed, but it was at
that election that Maggie Thatcher first became an MP. 'I disappeared into
the obscurity of the TV studios . . . such is the way the destiny of great
nations is decided,' joked Sir Robin.

Finland's imminent entry into the European Union has got off to a flying
start with the choice of Erkki Liikanen as the country's first European
commissioner. Not only is he one of the most assiduous party-throwers in
Brussels, where he currently serves as EU ambassador, but he knows his way
around the organisation - which is more than can be said for many new
commissioners.
However, it was touch and go whether Liikanen, 44, would get the job. Early
yesterday morning, Prime Minister Esko Aho was still balking at sending
Liikanen, a member of the opposition Social Democrats. Aho, who leads the
agrarian-based centre party, wanted Ekso Ollila, a Bank of Finland director;
others favoured Pertti Salolainen, the foreign trade minister who led
Finland's negotiations to enter the Union. Failure to agree allowed
President Martti Ahtisaari to push the job Liikanen's way.
Liikanen's reputation is certainly higher in Brussels than in Finland where
voters still remember him quitting as finance minister in the previous
government just before the economy crashed. Will he be as lucky when Jacques
Santer hands out the portfolios?
Insiders tip the Flying Finn for the personnel portfolio - not particularly
exciting but one which will leave other commissioners looking for favours.
But why not the more high-powered internal market portfolio, which remains
in search of a political heavyweight?

FT  26 OCT 94 / French blood sport: Mitterrand must be amused by the
conservatives' back-stabbing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The frenzied struggle be-tween rival rightwing politicians in France, ahead
of next year's presidential election, has now reached a pitch of ferocity
that would be hilarious if it were not so murderous.
Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR Gaullist party, is desperately trying
to shove himself ahead of Mr Edouard Balladur, the Gaullist prime minister;
Mr Balladur is equally desperately trying to shoulder aside Mr Chirac; and
former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF
grouping, is trying to outmanoeuvre both of them.
None of these rivals is yet an official candidate. But the struggle has gone
so far between the two Gaullists, that their henchmen are already rounding
up rival supporters among the Gaullists in the National Assembly. In one
camp are those who support Mr Chirac because, as leader of the party, he has
a legitimate claim on the candidacy; in the other are those who support Mr
Balladur because they think he has a better chance of winning.
Last week Mr Balladur invited Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard d'Estaing to meet him
at the prime minister's office. His declared object was to negotiate an end
to mutual backbiting; but his purpose was also to assert his political
ascendancy as leader of the government.
Of course, his invitation was turned down. Mr Giscard d'Estaing issued a
chilling communique: he would think about it. Mr Chirac tried to turn the
tables, by issuing a counter-invitation of his own, calling on Mr Balladur
to pay him a visit in his capacity as party leader. Mr Balladur studiously
ignored this invitation.
The confrontation recalls a medieval face-off between king and pope, with Mr
Balladur representing the temporal power, and Mr Chirac the spiritual. It is
the peculiar consequence of a political and a party system which does not
have a recognised method of choosing between rival presidential candidates.
President Francois Mitterrand said last week that he is more 'interested'
than 'amused' by the back-stabbing on the right. One must assume that
advancing age has robbed him of what used to be a mordant sense of humour.
It is only 18 months since the forces of the right inflicted a crushing
defeat on his Socialist party, and swept to a majority in parliament. It is
hard to believe that Mr Mitterrand has not been enjoying some cackles at the
spectacle of the conservatives tearing themselves apart in the struggle for
the presidential succession.
This struggle is increasing the pressure on Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, to enter the contest as the candidate of the left.
Until recently, opinion polls showed him winning against Mr Chirac but
losing against Mr Balladur. But now Mr Balladur's rating has tumbled,
probably as a result of the corruption scandals affecting members or former
members of his government. So it now looks as if Mr Delors could have a good
chance of defeating either Mr Chirac or Mr Balladur, or both.
Officially, Mr Delors is non-committal. He has said repeatedly that he is
far too involved with his job in Brussels to start getting agitated about
running for another job in France, when success is uncertain and there is in
any case still plenty of time to make a decision. But many people in France,
especially on the left, are starting to believe that he will be unable to
resist the pressure to stand.
Mr Delors is no doubt flattered to be solicited, especially by those
socialists who always despised him for being too right wing; after 10 years
in Brussels he has become a grand international figure; and to come home to
the presidency would be the ultimate accolade of a public career. And yet I
just wonder if he will really go for the prize.
Last weekend, in Leiden in the Netherlands, he was presiding over a seminar
about the future of Europe, attended by some 120 European intellectuals -
professors, doctors, lawyers, sociologists, philosophers and the like. They
were talking about such large subjects as identity, democracy and work.
In practical terms, it was hard to say what it all added up to. On the other
hand, the event was a revealing symbol of Mr Delors's attitude to politics
and Europe. He believes politicians should hear what the intellectuals have
to say; and just as important, should mobilise the intellectuals in the
European cause. On Europe, Mr Delors is a conviction politician; he believes
that the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference must face the fundamental
political questions of Europe's ultimate destination.
His convictions must be urging him to stand for president; that way he could
press forward the European enterprise from Paris, as he has done from
Brussels over the past 10 years.
The problem is that Mr Delors apparently believes that France today is 55
per cent conservative. If he were to be elected president, precedent
suggests he would dissolve the National Assembly, in the hope that his own
election would help swing the voters behind the Socialist party. But if he
is right that France is 55 per cent conservative, he would still be faced
with a hostile conservative majority. And that would be a hard prospect for
a man embarking on the presidency at the age of 69.
If Mr Delors did not stand, he would remove the chief incentive for the
conservatives to unite behind a single candidate; by staying aloof, he would
maximise the odds that the Gaullists would split themselves asunder on the
rock of personal ambition.
But perhaps next spring the polls will persuade him that France is only 49
per cent conservative.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Steel back in the melting pot: The collapse of the EU rescue
plan for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Critics of the European Commission's two-year attempt to forge a rescue plan
for the European Union's steel industry had their chance to say 'I told you
so' yesterday.
Since 1992, the Commission has tried to persuade private and public sector
steelmakers to restructure and close down excess capacity.
But yesterday, the plan's two chief architects, Mr Karel Van Miert,
competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner,
finally recognised that the plan was dead and proposed abandoning it.
The Commission has succeeded in preventing a free-for-all on state aid to
ailing steelmakers and in achieving some capacity reduction. But it has
fallen well short of the minimum 19m tonne target that most observers
believe is necessary to avoid overcapacity when the industry next moves into
a downturn, a problem that has plagued the industry over the past 20 years.
The EU's big steelmakers first approached the Commission two years ago for
help in tackling the problems of recession, including competition from cheap
east European imports and their own manufacturing overcapacity.
Losses in the industry were piling up with some of the best-known
steelmakers - such as Krupp and Thyssen of Germany and Ilva of Italy - in
deep financial trouble.
A previous attempt by Brussels to organise the steel market in the early
1980s had involved direct intervention in the steel market. The so-called
Davignon plan, named after Mr Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner,
allowed the Commission to dictate individual companies' production quotas,
impose protectionist trade measures, and endorse subsidies and price
cartels.
This time, Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann adopted a different approach. The
Commission offered market supervision through quarterly guidance on
production and delivery volumes to encourage reduction in capacity. It
encouraged privatisation of publicly owned steelmakers to reduce capacity.
The plan also involved approval of industry levies to finance closures;
limited protection from cheap imports; and Ecu240m of social aid to
redundant steelworkers.
In the winter of 1992, Mr Fernand Braun, the Commission's special steel
envoy, elicited promises of 'potential' and 'probable' cuts in capacity of
about 17m tonnes in crude steel and some 11m tonnes in rolled products
during a series of negotiations with steel companies.
Yet it was clear from the outset that private steel companies were reluctant
to make real capacity cuts. State-owned steelmakers were also reluctant to
reduce capacity, and continued to lobby for state aid with the backing of
national governments or powerful regional lobbies.
'Too many steelmakers thought their competitors were more likely to go
under, or that it made more sense to wait for an upturn in prices,' says one
official.
The first significant blow to the rescue plan occurred last year when a
powerful local campaign prevented the closure of the loss-making Klockner
works near Bremen in Germany. Closing Klockner would have given an early
push toward the 19m tonne target; instead its survival encouraged others to
resist.
A second blow came last June when Mr Van Miert unexpectedly lost a battle in
the Commission over steel closures in the Bresciani region of northern
Italy. He wanted approval for Ecu415m of aid to help eliminate an estimated
5m tonnes in capacity.
When this was denied, Mr Van Miert promptly declared the steel plan 'dead'.
Weeks later, the full Commission approved a new version of the plan which
showed that the state aid to the Bresciani did not, in fact, violate EU
rules.
The Bresciani deal brought the cuts being pledged or carried out to about
15.5m of capacity and seemed to revive the rescue plan. But with steel
prices steadily improving, further capacity cuts could not be made as steel
companies found demand rising.
Messrs Van Miert and Bangemann tried another round of expensive dinners and
loud table-banging to persuade the steelmakers to find more cuts, with no
success.
'We just knew we were never going to get the extra capacity cuts,' said one
official, 'so we could no longer in good faith continue with the plan.'
Critics of the rescue plan have long feared that steelmakers would use a
short-term increase in demand to avoid or postpone painful decisions on
capacity cuts. Now, with the recession over, their fears have been
vindicated.
Late last month, German steelmakers said they were prepared to forgo the
Brussels aid package and wait for the next recession before trying once
again to agree on cuts.
The collapse comes as no surprise to industry analysts. Mr Rod Beddows of
Beddows &amp; Co, a steel consultancy, says overcapacity is not spread evenly
across the EU steel industry. The German industry, for example, is already
working at full capacity producing flat products, although the economic
recovery has yet to reach full swing.
More seriously, he questions the approach of trying to reduce overcapacity
as a solution to the industry's ills. Overcapacity, Mr Beddows believes, is
only a symptom of the real problem, state intervention via subsidies that
prop up uneconomic steelmakers.
'The Commission's plan was a non-solution to a non-problem,' he says. 'Until
the notion of state intervention in all its forms is removed, you won't get
a healthy industry.'
With the ending of the Commission's rescue plan, two issues remain
unresolved. First, there is concern that further painful attempts to cut
capacity will have to be made when the industry enters its next downturn, as
the task remains unfinished.
Second, non-subsidised producers continue to worry about subsidies to
loss-making competitors that threaten their own profitability. 'Subsidies
are still supporting capacity, and that nettle has to be grasped,' says
British Steel, one of the most profitable non-aided producers.
Even with the market picking up, some steelmakers continue to demand
subsidies. This week, Germany's economics ministry and the Treuhand
privatisation agency asked the Commission to back a rescue package for Eko
Stahl, the east German producer, worth DM890m (Pounds 365m).
Subsidies could re-emerge as a serious problem when the steel market begins
to fall again, with member countries coming under further pressure to
support loss-making producers.
However, the industry has learnt some vital lessons about how to survive in
a recession that might make the problems less serious in the future. These
include the need to be flexible as demand fluctuates.
'The decisive thing that we have learnt is to reduce the level of raw steel
production - to shut blast furnaces which in the past kept producing, no
matter what happened - and to base all our calculations on those reduced
levels,' says one German producer.
The steel companies are also learning to seek market solutions rather than
wait for Brussels to sort out the problems. Innovative transnational
alliances, reciprocal equity stakes and investments are beginning to create
a less nationally-based industry. That raises the prospect, albeit not
immediately, of an industry that can prosper without subsidies.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Attraction of locked currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER JACKSON MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last year the European Parliament's Economic Committee, of which I was
a member, interviewed Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy for 1 1/2 hours prior to his
appointment as president of the European Monetary Institute. Like you
('Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief', October 24), I
formed a very positive view of his expertise, pragmatism and commitment.
Given adequate convergence, the idea of irrevocable locking of member
currencies at an earlier stage than domestic use of the Ecu seems
increasingly attractive. The banks warn us of huge costs, difficulties and
lead times in introducing Ecu notes and coinage. On the other hand
irrevocable locking of currencies gives business most of the advantages with
few of the costs.
The approach to stage three of Emu would thus be 'a European currency with
local manifestations' in the form of existing domestic notes and coinage in
each member state involved. It is quite right that this has great advantages
in terms of public opinion as well.
However, I also advocate early consideration of the issue of perhaps two Ecu
notes (say Ecu50 and Ecu20, worth today the awkward sums of Pounds 39 and
Pounds 15.60 respectively) which would be legal tender as a parallel
currency in all Emu states, giving travellers some relief from the cost and
fuss of changing currencies, and showing an everyday benefit from a European
currency.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Food irradiation little more than an
expensive quick fix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms MARIA ELENA HURTADO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Proposing food irradiation as a solution to poisoning and death from
contaminated foods is a dangerous and expensive distraction ('Backing for
food process', October 19). In developing countries, where the problem is
most severe, it is not contaminated milk in need of irradiation that causes
child diarrhoea; it is diluting powdered milk with polluted water or using
unclean recipients. In developed countries, food handling and poor hygienic
conditions are also leading sources of food-borne diseases.
Furthermore, this expensive technology is suited only to a very small range
of foods. One of the prime uses for which it is being promoted is for
treating grains that have been infested during storage. Irradiating them
will leave grain full of dead insects or mice. Surely, it is better and
cheaper to improve storage facilities. Also, it is disingenuous to argue
that the loss of nutrients during irradiation - for example, vitamin E
levels can be reduced by 25 per cent - is 'really minimal' compared with the
loss through cooking. The fact of the matter is that irradiation only
compounds the problem of nutrient loss.
And while it is true that studies have shown that irradiated food at the
dosage levels recommended is safe to eat, few studies have been done on
humans for any length of time. Little is known, for example, about what
happens to pesticide and other chemical residues during irradiation. The
fear is that, as with many other subtle chemical changes, the impact will
not show up for many years.
It is one thing to monitor carefully administered doses in a laboratory;
quite another to do it for large quantities in an industrial plant.
Consumers have no independent means of assessing the validity of the
manufacturers' claims: as yet there is no cheap and reliable test for
inspecting the safeness of irradiated food.
What food irradiation does offer is an expensive quick fix. So instead of
ridding chickens of salmonella, as the Swedes have done, you irradiate them.
The priority of governments and international aid agencies must be to deal
with food contamination by improving harvesting, storage and manufacturing.
In the third world, spending scarce resources in providing clean water would
do much more for people's health than investing in expensive food
irradiation plants.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Iraq should export oil to aid
civilians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FAISAL AL-SABAH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Blackmail and mass hostage-taking are instruments of policy used by
Saddam Hussein, not only internally but also externally.
During the occupation of Kuwait, he held foreign civilians hostage: if
foreign aircraft bomb my installations, they will bomb their own citizens
also. He is now holding the Iraqi people hostage: if the sanctions hurt my
regime, they will hurt the Iraqi people also. In both cases he has used
large numbers of human beings as an object of blackmail.
Back in 1991, UN Resolutions 706 and 712 provided for oil sales by Iraq  -
equivalent to Dollars 1.6bn - to finance supplies for essential civilian
needs. This sum was to be reviewed according to those needs.
However, Saddam Hussein refuses to export oil so that he can use the
suffering of the Iraqi people as a means of blackmailing the world into
removing the sanctions completely, thus freeing his regime to regain its
former power.
Well-intentioned people who call for the end of the sanctions should not be
deceived by Saddam Hussein, but put pressure on him to export oil for
essential civilian needs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MILNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Inward &amp; upward' (October 18), makes the point that one
of the reasons Samsung is investing in Cleveland is the UK's membership of
the European Union. That is true as far as it goes. But, as you reported on
the front page the same day, the real EU-related factor in Samsung's
decision, according to Mr Chan Bea, UK managing director, was to counter
'possible anti-dumping measures by the EU'. The decision therefore seems to
be another triumph for proponents of 'fortress Europe'.
The question your leader did not address is how much damage to Europe and,
indeed, the world economy - and therefore to UK interests - the fortress
Europe doctrine is causing.

ITV launches a new drama series called Ellington (starring Chris Ellison in
the title role, just to be thoroughly confusing) with a 90-minute pilot. We
are told that Ellington is a sports promoter and personal manager who
'maintains his integrity and sense of fair play as he battles his way
through the corruption'. We are assured that, although he was raised in 'the
tough and shady environment of smoke-filled snooker halls and dingy boxing
gymnasia' Ellington is 'a survivor'. Well well. Presumably it will be, you
know, gritty? (8.30). Yet another documentary about yet another nasty small
group on the extreme right wing of British politics: Dispatches investigates
an organisation which it says has been linked to the British National Party,
'Combat 18', whose members, it is asserted, make threatening phone calls,
smash windows, make death threats, tamper with cars and put offensive
material through letter boxes (9.00 C4). The acting in Between The Lines is
still good, the writing is competent, but the series has lost its edge since
Tony and Harry left the Met (9.30 BBC1).

FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: Reflections on the sleaze factor - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many months ago it was suggested in this column that Between The Lines
on BBC1 might be the best police series to appear on British television
since Z Cars. How quickly things change. Today, Between The Lines is not
only not the best police series, it is not even second best: ITV's Cracker
is clearly superior, and even The Bill, also on ITV, is better.
That 'even' is probably not quite fair, since The Bill has always been
excellent, but as a half-hour programme with three episodes a week you would
not normally expect it to bear comparison with a series such as Between The
Lines which is made in limited runs, on bigger budgets, with episodes
lasting 55 minutes.
Yet The Bill is, at present (excluding its 10th-anniversary double-length
special which, as so often in these cases, was an inferior episode) doing
considerably better than Between The Lines. Whatever happened?
It is probable that Between The Lines was not planned from the outset as a
long-running series in the way that, say, The Sweeney was, but when the
first batch was so well received it must have seemed almost imperative to
make more. The BBC is not so flush with good middlebrow drama that it can
afford to ignore a success like that.
For some reason, however, it was decided for this new series to remove the
central characters from the police corruption squad in which they had been
working and bring them out into the private sector. This has proved
disastrous. Previously we had tight, intricate plots which cleverly explored
the way in which bureaucracies operate and also vividly illustrated the
'sleaze factor' that has become such a feature of British public life.
Now the scripts have become slack, banal and familiar. Tony Clark takes a
job in, for instance, Tunisia, so that we get expenses-paid foreign trips
just like all those other series, or he takes a job in hotel security and,
ho hum, there is the statutory chase through a busy kitchen. How are the
mighty fallen.
At the peak of its achievement Between The Lines had a modicum of home-life
interest which added a lot to the formula because Mo (Siobhan Redmond)
proved to be a lesbian, Tony (Neil Pearson) suffered from something
approaching satyriasis, and Harry (Tom Georgeson, who so often steals these
programmes with his fag-puffing sergeant) went home to a wife who was dying.
None of this affected the meat of the scripts, until Tony's great affair
with the Francesca Annis character, and since she was in government security
that was legitimate. But now home life is being used in what looks like an
attempt to make up for lack of interest in the job, and it feels a bit
desperate.
Of course, there is no law saying that a series about police personnel
cannot be centrally interested in the private lives of its characters -
think of Juliet Bravo. But it is best to set out in that direction from the
start, as Cracker did. In the first episode of Z Cars in January 1962 in a
conversation about a murdered colleague, Sergeant John Watt, talking to
Inspector Charlie Barlow about the likelihood of the killer being suitably
punished, referred bitterly to the police psychiatrist as a 'trick cyclist'.
Three decades later the trick cyclist has become the hero, albeit a deeply
flawed hero, of the latest police series.
Here home life is just as important to the scripts as police work, sometimes
more so. Furthermore, it is the relationships and conversations in the
private life of our hero, Fitz, so splendidly embodied by Robbie Coltrane,
which provide much of the entertainment.
Fitz is a rogue and a bastard, but a witty rogue and a cunning bastard. It
is impossible not to laugh when you watch him in next Monday's episode, in
front of the bathroom mirror, rehearsing the argument he will use on his
poor wife, Judith (Barbara Flynn, appealing and fanciable as ever), then
promptly going downstairs and repeating it word for word, even though you
recognise how self-serving and manipulative he is being.
In Britain in 1994 television police series serve much the same function as
cinema westerns did in the US in the 1940s and 1950s. Though popular because
they offer the audience such a familiar formula, they allow within that
formula immense scope for writers and directors to deal with almost anything
they wish.
As with westerns, police series can reflect changes in the nation's
perception of its own image. In The Bill last week there was a startlingly
grim and honest admission from a high-ranking officer: 'The war on drugs is
already lost . . . all we can do is go on pushing people through the
revolving doors . . .'
Above all, series of this kind provide a place for dealing with changes in
public morality in a way that many viewers seem to feel is less forbidding
than that found in so many current affairs programmes.
Unsurprisingly, British television is not alone in this. NYPD Blue on
Channel 4 proves that much the same thing happens in the US and Le Cop II on
BBC2 last week gave an idea of what you might see in France. If we accept
that these productions provide more or less accurate reflections of the
mores in the countries concerned, the eye-opening fact is that Britain, for
all its supposed moral turpitude, is not as far down the road as those other
countries.
Both productions highlighted a relativism which is frightening for anyone
who believes that maintenance of the rule of law is the foundation of any
civilised society. In these dramas the police are better than the bad guys,
but only just.
In Le Cop II the rascally old pair of buddies in the Montmartre district are
presented as superior to their go-getting modern replacements because they
take smaller kickbacks. In NYPD Blue you would often have difficulty
slipping a razor blade between the morals of the police and those of the
crooks.
It is scant comfort, perhaps, but judging from these police dramas, Britain
has not yet slipped so far down the vortex as some other countries . . . or
are we just better at covering it up?

FT  26 OCT 94 / Arts: Semi-comic King Kong takes powerful grip - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is as though an ancient Greek tragedian has completed his trilogy and is
turning his hand to lighter things. Harrison Birtwistle, who dealt so
massively with myth and ritual in The Mask of Orpheus and Gawain, has
returned to cast a wry backward glance over similar material for his new
semi-comic opera.
A year ago it looked as if The Second Mrs Kong might not reach the stage as
intended. The Arts Council had singled out Glyndebourne Touring Opera to
lose its subsidy, but after much argument the company won a reprieve - an
outcome which is starting to look as much of a ritual as anything in
Birtwistle's operas. This autumn's GTO tour includes revivals of Yevgeny
Onegin and Il barbiere di Siviglia, with this Birtwistle premiere in pride
of place.
The idea of King Kong came from the opera's librettist, Russell Hoban. He
had always loved the film and found that the composer had, too. As a
scenario, they envisaged souls meeting in the world of shadows, each
choosing characters according to his own partiality. Hoban was obsessed by
Vermeer's 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Birtwistle - true to form - wanted
Orpheus and Eurydice. Goebbels was going to put in an appearance at one
point, but then they decided against it. Other sundry dead souls include a
Texan film producer and an Indian spiritualist.
There is no logic to the story. Characters from different times and places
are thrown together, merely because their creators want to amuse themselves
seeing what might happen. The girl with the pearl earring from Vermeer's
portrait is soon reclining in a 21st-century living-room, zapping the
channels on her wall-sized television, watching repeats of old films like
Brief Encounter, a British Rail documentary and - yes - King Kong.
At first it seems that Birtwistle, tongue-in-cheek, is going to parody
himself. (The scene of the shooting, repeated over and over, satirizes the
ritualistic repetitions of The Mask of Orpheus.) Then the tone falters.
Dense mists of sound build up in the orchestra, submerging any sharpness of
mind and obscuring the words, despite the authoritative presence of Elgar
Howarth in the pit. A scene involving a computer search for King Kong is
overlong and woefully heavy-handed. A fight scene sinks to the weakest
knockabout humour.
By the interval it looks as though the opera is lost, but come the second
act, composer and librettist unexpectedly nail the right style - mythic
pretension played up one moment, brought down to earth with a comic bump the
next. Setting out in search of the girl with the pearl, Kong and Orpheus
encounter first a sphinx with a sharp ear for one-liners and then a
character called the Death of Kong, leading to a superhuman struggle of
ideas where the issues slug it out on stage. All this is more entertaining.
It helps, crucially, that now the words can be heard. Philip Langridge is
clarity itself as Kong, a bizarre addition to his gallery of operatic
portrayals. Nuala Willis is amusingly dead-pan as the Sphinx. Michael Chance
sings beautifully as the counter-tenor Orpheus, especially after he has been
beheaded (shades of Gawain). Helen Field reaches tirelessly for the top
notes as Vermeer's Pearl. Among some magical sights in Tom Cairns'
production are two haunting scenes in which Anubis rows the souls back and
forth across the waters of the underworld.
Above all, the music finds its sense of direction in the second act.
Birtwistle shapes the act in a single arc, starting Ring-like from a few
ideas swirling in deep soundwaves, through the comedy of the central scenes,
to a peroration of primeval power underpinning what I take to be the opera's
serious message: that ideas live on, even though people may die. Like so
many new operas, it asks to be seen half a dozen times, but its very
complexity means it is unlikely to get the chance. That is the tragic irony
of the modern opera composer.
Sponsored by The Baring Foundation and the John S Cohen Foundation. GTO at
Glyndebourne until October 29, then on tour to Oxford, Norwich, Plymouth,
Woking and Manchester.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Mahogany controls loom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Europe's biggest importers of hardwoods is backing a Dutch government
initiative to control the trade in Brazilian mahogany under a United Nations
convention.
Timbmet, of Oxford, has surprised environmentalists by going against its
trade association and supporting a proposal to declare officially that
Brazilian mahogany is an endangered species.
The UK is the second biggest consumer of the wood, importing about 35 per
cent of Brazil's production. Forty per cent goes to the US. The Worldwide
Fund for Nature (WWF) says the trees, which grow slowly, are on the verge of
extinction.
'Brazilian mahogany will become a thing of the past if the trade continues
extracting logs at present volumes in the way that it does,' says Francis
Sullivan, forestry conservation officer at WWF UK.
Daniel Kemp, chairman of Timbmet, says the proposed listing will not hamper
trade. 'But we feel there will be more control and in the long term that
will be good for business.'
The Dutch government will propose the listing at next month's meeting of the
Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in
Florida.
Cites has a two-tier list of endangered species. Appendix I includes those
which are virtually extinct and in which all trade is banned, such as ivory,
some rare birds and Brazilian rosewood. Species listed on Appendix II can be
traded but under restrictions. If the Dutch succeed and Brazilian mahogany
joins this list, it would compel the Brazilian government to ensure that the
trade does not harm the species. Importers would have to obtain export
permits from Brazil.
The UK Timber Trade Federation is against a listing. It says there is not
enough scientific evidence to justify it and Brazil does not support the
initiative. Timbmet remains a member of the federation.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: High hopes for hemp -
Producers are hoping to tap a growing market for natural fibres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the untrained eye they look like bales of straw. But the bundles of long,
greyish fibre drying in the late autumn sunshine on 40 farms across
south-east England are attracting an unusually high degree of excitement.
The fibre is hemp, part of the cannabis family, a centuries-old crop which
is making a comeback in Europe and the US as an ecologically friendly raw
material for clothing and paper.
The association with the dope-smoking 1970s meant that not only farmers'
hopes for the crop were riding high when the first commercial plants
appeared in the UK last year. But the youngsters who raided a field and
filled dustbin bags with plant tops were disappointed. 'This is a low
narcotic variety,' explains Ian Low, a director of Hemcore, the UK's only
hemp merchant. 'You'd have to smoke 50 acres to get high.'
Hemcore, set up 18 months ago by an Essex farmer and a group of agricultural
merchants, persuaded the Home Office to license its first 1,500 acres of
hemp last year. It hopes this will give it a lead in the growing market for
natural fibres - particularly in the US and Germany. Neither country permits
domestic production because of the association with drugs.
Yet hemp's roots go back to the Middle Ages, when it was grown widely in
East Anglia. It was used in Europe for ropes, sails and sacking until early
this century, when it was ousted by imported cotton and jute.
Hemcore is hoping to turn the wheel full circle, reaping capital from the
fact that the first jeans were made of hemp in early 19th-century America.
It has contacted Levi Strauss, the leading US jeans manufacturer, which is
'very interested' in the fibre, says Low.
He admits Hemcore has some way to go in developing the technology to make
hemp soft and stretchy. It is collaborating with flax processors in Northern
Ireland on refining the coarse fibres.
Some textile agreements are already under way, however. Esprit, an
international fashion business based in San Francisco, plans to launch bags,
jackets, shirts and skirts made of hemp and hemp-and-wool mixtures next year
as part of its 'Ecollection'. One of its suppliers is Evergreen, a Yorkshire
textile company which buys its hemp from Hemcore.
'Hemp fits in with our environmental objectives,' says Lynda Grose, research
director for the Ecollection. 'It is grown with minimal watering and no
pesticides and herbicides. It is also very durable.'
The crop, planted in late spring, surges to about 10ft in three months.
Before planting, the soil has to be prepared with fertiliser because hemp
takes up a lot of nutrients. But no chemical sprays are needed as the plants
are hardy and grow quickly enough to outsmart weeds.
The powerful roots break up the soil, leaving it fertile for the next crop.
Experience in east Europe, where hemp was an important industrial crop
before the break-up of the Soviet Union, suggests that yields of wheat grown
in fields where hemp has previously been cultivated are 0.7 tonnes a hectare
higher than those achieved following any other rotational crop. Hemp roots
are also rapidly biodegradable, making ploughing easy.
The revival of interest in fibre crops in the European Union springs both
from growing consumer demand for 'natural' clothes and from farm policy
reforms. In France, Italy and Spain, hemp survived the onslaught of imported
fibres earlier this century and continued to be grown for paper pulp
production.
But the introduction two years ago of set-aside, the policy which obliges EU
farmers to take land out of food production, has boosted the search for new
markets for industrial crops such as hemp.
The European Commission provides generous subsidies of Pounds 245 an acre
for fibre crops and exempts such crops from set-aside rules. Cereal farmers
who grow flax or hemp can thus reduce the overall amount of land they have
to leave idle.
If 'green' textiles look like being the most immediately lucrative market
for hemp, paper-making is likely to absorb the biggest volumes. The long
fibres are particularly suited to thin or open-textured paper, such as
cigarette paper, teabags or coffee filters. They can also be used to
strengthen recycled paper.
A Fl 10m (Pounds 3.7m) four-year project funded by the Dutch government
recently concluded that hemp was an economically viable crop for making
anything from bank notes to newsprint.
A novel mechanical processing technique developed by the Dutch Land
Organisation, which carried out the research, is attracting interest from
paper producers in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden and the UK.
Thea van Kemenade, project co-ordinator, said hemp could also be used for
building materials and as a reinforcing agent in plastic car components. 'I
would expect hemp to make a big comeback,' she said.
Earlier this month, the UK government announced a Pounds 100,000 three-year
grant to develop new markets for natural fibres such as hemp and flax.
Silsoe, the government-funded agricultural research station, has developed a
machine to strip the bark off the stem and extract the fibre from these
crops. Its aim is to enable individual farms to process their own hemp into
crude fibre, which could then be turned into padding and stuffing for the
furniture industry.
'If we can make full use of all the material from the plant, it will be in
the top league,' said Harry Gilbertson, natural-fibres expert at Silsoe.
Hemcore itself is investigating uses for other parts of the plant such as
the seeds, whose oil is suitable for cosmetics.
'If we look into the next century, I think it will be very big,' says Low.
'There could be tens or hundreds of thousands of hectares of hemp.'
But when vision threatens to overcome reality, Low points out that one of
the company's best markets today is decidedly down-to-earth.
Hemp, being highly absorbent, is increasingly popular in Germany and Britain
as bedding for horses.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: A rumbling in the waterworks -
Jane Martinson on attracting tourists to a sewage plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Managers of a sewage treatment plant in south-east Australia are considering
plans to turn it into a tourist attraction.
The 10,851 ha plant - which produces more beef than any farm in the region -
treats 55 per cent of the wastewater generated by the city of Melbourne.
Natural purification methods rather than chemical treatment are used to
produce effluent, which is deposited in Port Phillip Bay. Some 16,000 cattle
graze the grass fertilised by raw sewage; livestock generated just over
ADollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m) in income last year.
Much of the sewage is treated in lagoons, which cover 1,667 ha at the
Werribee site, 35 km south-west of Melbourne. Three large lagoons built in
the past six years have been designed to control odour and produce biogas.
Mechanical aerators speed up the process of digestion and reduce odour,
while covers are being installed to capture methane and other odorous gases.
The methane will eventually be burnt off to generate power.
The plan to create an 'eco-tourist park' focuses on 600 ha of older lagoons.
Over 250 species of birds are found around them. Many rare species have been
recorded, including up to 50 per cent of the world's total of the
orange-bellied parrot.
The area is listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
as a wetland of international importance.
A study conducted this summer by Melbourne Parks and Waterways claimed the
sewage plant could attract up to 160,000 tourists a year if developed as an
eco-tourist park. The organisation manages a funding programme which aims to
encourage community use of open spaces and the preservation of wildlife.
Last year it allocated ADollars 6.2m to such schemes.
Melbourne Water, the state-owned authority which manages Werribee, says
there is 'definite commercial potential there' and has commissioned a full
economic analysis of the project.
There are a number of advantages to the plan, not least enhanced public
relations. Melbourne's sewers, with their network of old brick tunnels,
suffered three serious collapses two years ago. Sewage spilled into a local
river and it took more than three months to stem the flow.
More recently the Environmental Protection Agency, the government watchdog,
has decreed that checks on effluent discharges into Port Phillip Bay are to
be made much more stringent by 2004. Melbourne Water has committed itself to
complying with the regulations by 1997. It has also earmarked ADollars 32m
for upgrading its two major treatment plants.
The impact on wildlife of a significant increase in visitor numbers is
causing some concern, however. Alex Sandles, the wastewater treatment
manager at Werribee, says birds are attracted by the food, security and calm
of the plant. 'The lakes near here tend to be full of waterskiers and other
noise.'
The plan has some support among environment groups. Karri Giles, water
catchment manager for Friends of the Earth in Australia, says: 'We are
positive as long as it is done sensitively.'
However, the proposal may be delayed by the shake-up planned for Melbourne
Water by a state government keen on privatisation. It was to appear before
the authority's board in November.
Nonetheless, Sandles feels the plan will be implemented. Werribee treatment
plant could become part of a 'complete weekend package' for Melbourne's
tourists, he says.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Open to suggestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company suggestion schemes can pay handsome dividends if the arrangements
are well packaged and backed by attractive rewards for employees.
A study carried out by the Industrial Society* found that companies which
have taken dusty suggestions boxes down from the walls and revamped their
schemes are benefiting from a stream of new ideas.
The society has produced an information pack for employers which includes
guidance and examples of successful schemes from 12 organisations. Some of
the more productive schemes include:
Land Rover's relaunched scheme. This reaped suggestions worth Pounds 2m in
its first year. One suggestion that less fuel should be put in the tanks to
drive cars from the production line saved Pounds 25,000 a year and earned
Pounds 5,000 for the employee who suggested it.
In the Rover parent company a suggestion that industrial gloves could be
recycled saved the group more than Pounds 100,000 a year. The staff member
who made the suggestion received Pounds 5,000.
Another Pounds 5,000 was awarded to a woman who suggested an alternative
printing process to replace the need to laminate the covers of car
handbooks. That saved Pounds 30,000 a year.
Midland Bank's Bright Ideas scheme. Subsequent proposals saved more than
Pounds 250,000.
East Midland's Eureka scheme. This helped save Pounds 22,000. Some Pounds
5,000 has been paid out in rewards to staff.
'Suggestion schemes are vital because they encourage innovation, quality and
cost savings,' says the Industrial Society's Georgina Tate. 'Good schemes
promote employee involvement and commitment.'
*The suggestions scheme information pack is available, price Pounds 35, from
the Industrial Society information service. Tel 071 262 2401.

FT  26 OCT 94 / People: Campbell shows his colours at Courtaulds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Campbell, 48, who has been running Courtaulds' fibres and chemicals
business, has been appointed deputy chief executive (operations) and made
responsible for the group's three main businesses. The directors responsible
for these areas will, in future, report to him.
Since the demerger in 1990, Courtaulds has reorganised its business from
five divisions into three and Campbell's promotion is one of several changes
as the international chemicals group completes the reorganisation of its
management structure which began in February.
Under the old regime, executives had been responsible for various parts of
the world as well as various products. Under the new structure
responsibilities for operations and development are being separated with a
deputy chief executive responsible for each, and with geographic and
business lines clarified.
Eryl Morris, 51, who was responsible for coating and the Far East until
earlier this year, has been appointed deputy chief executive (development)
with responsibility for corporate development, planning and research. His
brief includes responsibilities for all regions with opportunities for
expansion - Far East, East Europe and Latin America.
Neville Petersen, 54, who had been chief executive of Courtaulds' European
coatings business, becomes responsible for the group's worldwide coatings
operations and will have reporting to him the chief executives of the
various overseas coatings businesses.
David Wilkinson, 55, who joined Courtaulds in 1961, has been put in charge
of the fibres business and will join the main Courtaulds board at the start
of next year.
Courtaulds has also made several changes to its senior management team below
board level. Peter Fearn takes over as chief executive of the European
coatings business next April and Bill McPherson is moving to Singapore to be
chief executive of the Asia Pacific coatings business.
Peter Rodgers is appointed chief executive of Courtaulds Chemicals from
January 1 and will report to Gordon Campbell. Colin Welford is to take over
as chief executive of Novaceta.

FT  26 OCT 94 / People: De Villiers - the man to decide whether Disney will
beam up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Etienne de Villiers, managing director of The Walt Disney Company in the UK,
has been promoted to the newly-created post of president, international
television for Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications.
De Villiers, a qualified civil engineer and Rhodes scholar who was once
responsible for running South Africa's largest cinema chain, is at the
moment mainly in charge of international sales, marketing and distribution
of Disney programming to broadcasters.
The job at the head of the newly created division will involve
responsibility for television production and a number of international
television businesses previously managed as separate entities, such as
pay-TV, satellite television and cable.
One of the important tasks of the new division will be to concentrate on the
establishment of Disney family channels throughout Europe and in other parts
of the world.
In August, Disney announced its first significant new media investment in
Europe - a plan to launch a German satellite television channel in January
in partnership with CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcaster. It
was made clear at the time that the deal could be a model for other
satellite channels based on family entertainment.
De Villiers said yesterday that he hoped to decide by Christmas whether or
not to launch a Disney-backed satellite channel in the UK.
'We have finished the qualitative research and are now working on the
quantitative research,' said de Villiers, who first joined Disney in 1988 as
president of Buena Vista International, the main programme sales arm.
The company wants to try to establish how many people would watch and what
they would pay for a Disney channel on satellite and cable. Apart from
deciding whether or not to go ahead, de Villiers is also considering whether
such a UK channel should be launched by Disney alone or with partners.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Animator at work - Dominique Damon explains to
Ian Rodger her business version of 'explication de texte'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may sound unlikely, but the management approach of Dominique Damon,
recently appointed chief operating officer of Alusuisse-Lonza, the Swiss
aluminium, chemicals and packaging group, bears a striking resemblance to
the great French discipline of 'explication de texte'.
The idea behind explication de texte is not to make grand assessments from
an overview of a whole novel, play or poem, but to focus on a small, but
significant, text, and thereby to achieve a new enlightenment about the
whole.
The 47-year-old Damon, who is French, tries to do just that, travelling
nearly constantly to visit the group's subsidiaries in Europe and the US and
examine with the managers very specific problems.
On a recent visit to a subsidiary in Basle, for example, she devoted the day
to working capital. 'What could be more banal, you may say, and it would be
banal if I just walked in and looked at the figures and said, 'right, you
have to do better,' and walked out,' she explains.
Instead, she sat down with the managers of the subsidiary and probed into
the finest details until they all understood what was really wrong and could
come up with ideas for improvements.
'I am not interested in them making presentations for me. I want an exchange
of ideas at every level,' she says. 'People are stressed if there are
problems, and you can make it worse if you do not help. It is not for me to
find solutions, but I cannot leave people in anguish.'
She uses the French word 'animation' to describe her approach - roughly a
combination of motivating and stimulating - and she is convinced that it can
conquer most management problems.
She recalled visiting a company in the Netherlands - in pre-Alusuisse days -
where an absenteeism rate of 16 per cent was destroying its competitiveness.
She was told nothing could be done because that was a national pattern. She
refused to accept it, meeting again and again with the managers and
employees until ways were found to bring it down.
Is it easier for a woman to win the confidence of employees than for a man?
'I don't think so, except in extreme situations.' She recalls an occasion at
the beginning of her career at the Boussois flat glass company in Paris.
A particularly rowdy union was staging a sit-in and her superiors were so
frightened that they sent her in to deal with the leaders. 'They were
shouting loudly. My only tactic was to talk very quietly. Gradually, things
calmed down until only one man was shouting, and I said calmly that either
he had to go or that I would go.'
Damon's most noteworthy achievement in her six years at Alusuisse has been
to make nine acquisitions - including the big Canadian Lawson Mardon
packaging group early this year - in five years, without a disaster and
without losing the companies' top managers.
She says she is careful when looking at acquisition candidates to pick those
whose natural development has been artificially blocked - perhaps by a
nervous owner or excessive debt or the lack of critical mass. Then from the
day of the purchase, she moves in, sets goals and gets people 'animated'.
Within a week of the takeover of Lawson Mardon, every line executive was
given clear targets to achieve.
Damon has a doctorate in experimental psychology but has never been to
business school. She reads books on management but has no favourites among
the gurus. 'They all add something, but they tend to repeat themselves after
a few years,' she says.
Now that she is chief operating officer and soon to be group chief
executive, should she not be sitting back, contemplating the big picture and
leaving the nitty gritty to others? 'I hope not,' she replies without
hesitation. Questions such as whether Alusuisse should have three legs or
five, or whether packaging should make up 50 per cent or 75 per cent of the
whole in 10 years do not seem to interest her.
'Of course, we have a very strong strategic team in Zurich that analyses
every project and every company's business plan. We use a three-year rolling
plan and we have worked very hard on the accuracy of our forecasts. But I do
not see any need for a longer-term plan. We know our markets well enough
that we should not go wrong.'

Andrew Cracknell, who was appointed worldwide executive creative director of
the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi-owned Bates (formerly BSB) advertising agency network
less than a year ago, has left the company. Bates says Cracknell, 48, had
left 'due to an as yet unresolved contractual dispute'.
Cracknell has been part of the New York-based team, headed by Michael
Bungey, chief executive, which has been attempting to inject new life into
the flagging US part of the network. Bungey says he views Cracknell's
departure, after seven years with the agency, with 'deep regret'.

Robert Maxted is on the lookout for a new company following his decision to
step down from the board of Pillar, the property investment company he built
during the early 1990s and which was floated earlier this year.
Maxted's departure follows the arrival in the summer of Raymond Mould and
Patrick Vaughan, the high-profile duo who led the buy-out of Arlington
Securities from British Aerospace in 1989 and who are now chairman and chief
executive of Pillar.
Maxted stepped aside to become property director, but having been in the
chief executive's shoes since the company's formation in 1991 found the new
role too constricting.
Maxted has a long history in the property business. In 1987 he sold his
private company Mount Row to Speyhawk, the developer which went into
receivership last May.
However, he left Speyhawk three years before its collapse and set up Pillar,
which was originally conceived as a vulture fund picking up
institutional-quality assets as the property market crumbled.
'I'm looking for another vehicle, preferably in the public sector,' comments
Maxted. 'I want to be more of my own boss again.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Management: Competition keeps the wheels rolling - Charles
Batchelor continues a series on public services with a look at Plymouth
Citybus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Waiting alongside Plymouth Citybus' smart red, grey and white buses in the
city's Royal Parade are a couple of plain grey buses which provide the
city's park-and-ride service. 'You can see that livery was decided by a
committee,' says Brian Fisher, managing director of Citybus, ruefully.
Subsidised by the local authority but operated by Citybus, the park-and-ride
fleet does indeed sport a livery chosen by the city council. But the colour
of these buses apart, Fisher says he has a relaxed relationship with the
town hall, following the hiving-off of its bus operations into a separate
company nearly seven years ago.
Fisher and his three-man team of senior managers are widely regarded in the
bus industry as running one of the best-managed companies still in municipal
ownership. They have improved the frequency and quality of services and
converted a public subsidy into a healthy profit.
Before the 1985 Transport Act forced councils to establish separately
managed bus companies, Plymouth City Transport received an annual subsidy of
Pounds 400,000. Losses continued for the first three years after separation
but the company has since achieved steadily rising profits reaching Pounds
1.28m on turnover of Pounds 9.6m in 1993.
As well as achieving a healthy profit and loss account, the company improved
the quality of services after carrying out a review of fares, service
frequency and passenger numbers. Minibuses replaced most of the expensive,
cumbersome double deckers to provide a faster, more frequent service to
outlying housing estates.
Passenger numbers rose, but not sufficiently to meet the nationally
negotiated wage levels Plymouth Citybus inherited. An attempt to force down
costs by reducing holidays and overtime payments led to a drivers' strike,
but after 10 days the strikers backed down and accepted the terms.
While Citybus' vehicles were off the road, Western National, a rival
operator, applied to run on its routes. A nine-month bus war ensued before
the two companies called a truce.
The bus war was undeniably a setback, but Fisher, who is 48, says it was
also a period of rapid learning. He joined the buses at the age of 18 after
a brief spell of working for a road haulage company. During his career he
has spent time on local government management courses, though most of his
experience has been acquired 'as I went along. A lot of it is common sense,
balancing income and costs'.
The financial management of a bus company is certainly helped by its
positive cash flow - you don't buy bus tickets on credit. But the strategy
adopted by Fisher and his senior managers has several elements. They are:
To rid buses of their reputation as a downmarket means of transport.
Plymouth Citybus has invested heavily in new vehicles and insists on a smart
dress code for its drivers.
To improve the frequency and reliability of its service 'so that passengers
can throw away the timetable'. Many outlying parts of Plymouth now have up
to seven services an hour.
To tighten management controls. Under the council, accounts took three
months to prepare. Now the board receives a weekly report on bus
availability, staff sickness, wages costs and the like. Monthly management
accounts are available within five working days of the month end.
To make use of facilities needed to support the bus operations to earn
outside revenues. Citybus has successfully bid for maintenance work from the
Ministry of Defence, British Rail and Devon County Council. These contracts
bring in Pounds 700,000 of turnover.
To expand profitable sidelines of the main bus business. It has increased
its coach tour activities five-fold since independence and now generates
turnover of Pounds 1m.
To improve relations with staff. Brian Vincent, a driver and the employee
representative on the board, confirms a change from the council days when
managers appeared intent on distancing themselves from the workforce. Yet
discipline has been tightened.
Competition from private companies may have provided the spur for
municipally owned operators to improve standards - but even so industry
observers agree that Plymouth Citybus has achieved a remarkable
transformation.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Hothouse treatment or a spell in overalls? -
Fast-track development programmes for high-flyers may need some rethinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Are managements doing enough to identify and develop the people who may end
up leading their organisations? A new study suggests that fast-track
programmes for high-flyers could benefit from a little more thought.
What GHN, the career management consultant, calls a future top manager
appears from the research to be typically something of an idealistic beast
who, rather than needing hothouse treatment, would benefit far more from a
bit of corporate 'national service' in overalls on the production line.
The report compared the views of 204 personnel directors and managers with
those of 103 men and women, aged between 27 and 35, identified by management
or their peers as high-flyers. All worked in companies with annual turnovers
of more than Pounds 80m.
The report concluded that high-flyers needed to be brought down to earth.
They understood little of what was needed of them and their self-image
differed markedly from how they were perceived by personnel directors.
Both groups agreed that three important qualities for potential top managers
were leadership, communications skills and strategic thinking. However, the
personnel directors rated several other skills or qualities as equally
important such as intelligence, entrepreneurial ability and presentational
skills. The high-flyers did not mark these highly.
The groups disagreed widely over how much help or guidance the high-flyers
needed, particularly in interpersonal skills. More than two-thirds of the
personnel directors said that young managers needed to develop their skills
in managing teams or subordinates, interpersonal relationships,
communication and achieving flexibility in management style.
In contrast, less than half of the future top managers said they needed help
in managing people and the proportions admitting they needed guidance in
developing other skills were lower still - fewer than a third were worried
about communication and only a fifth thought they needed to develop more
flexible management styles or interpersonal relationships.
The high-flyers appeared more motivated by pay than their personnel chiefs
thought they should be, although both groups agreed that job satisfaction
was important for retaining loyalty and maintaining performance. Another
finding was that women appeared to be getting a raw deal. Those questioned
were not getting the breadth of training opportunities given to their male
counterparts.
One problem with the fast-track or hothouse approach is that inevitably some
people will fall by the wayside. Equally there will be people in an
organisation - the quiet workers who started as secretaries or clerical
assistants on the assembly line - who are not identified in the selection
process.
What then happens when the high-flyer gets to the top of the tree aged 39
3/4 ? How long will he or she stay there and what will they do when they
leave? GHN says the high-flyers should be shown how to take responsibility
for their own careers and to protect their future employment prospects.
Rover, the car maker, seems to have understood the danger of promoting
ill-prepared managers. Each graduate must work for a time on the assembly
line to help them understand the production process.
The GHN report concludes that development of high-flyers needs greater
preparation and scope. 'MBAs and traditional training techniques have their
place, but they only represent one aspect of a person's development,' said
Susan Bloch, a GHN consultant.
'Much greater emphasis is needed on broader management skills, including
communications and interpersonal relationships which the survey asserts are
positively received when delivered through coaching and mentoring.'
A copy of the full report is available from GHN, price Pounds 30 plus VAT.

Employment Conditions Abroad, the trade association which provides
international pay and cost-of-living statistics to help its member companies
fix local and expatriate pay packages in different parts of the world, has
just published its annual executive pay comparison.
The graph on the right shows that, in terms of what a salary can buy, Hong
Kong has leap-frogged Switzerland and Germany in the past year to head the
league. The big movers have been Hong Kong and Singapore, reflecting
executive pay awards in both countries which have moved upwards well ahead
of inflation rates.
Hong Kong companies are finding they have to pay high salaries to retain
their best managers who may be tempted to leave for countries such as Canada
to try to obtain a second passport. High pay is also needed to lure back
those who have already acquired dual citizenship.
Singapore's pay rates have been responding to the knock-on effect of
companies seeking to expand their operations in response to pressures in
Hong Kong.
As well as earning high gross salaries, Hong Kong executives also have the
benefits of a marginal tax rate of 15 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Report says PM ruled out any deal
with Fayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister yesterday published a report by Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary, after an investigation into allegations of impropriety
against members of the government brought by Mr Mohamed Fayed.
In the report Sir Robin said that he was asked to investigate the
allegations on September 30, one day after they had been brought to Mr John
Major by an informant.
According to Sir Robin the informant said that the Harrods chief had sought
a meeting with the prime minister 'principally because of Mr Fayed's wish to
have the Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report on the takeover
of the House of Fraser revised or withdrawn'.
The report said: 'He had made a number of allegations against government
ministers and was contemplating passing them to others.'
The prime minister told Sir Robin that it would be impossible for him to
meet Mr Fayed. Mr Major added that he would not make any deal with the
Harrods chief - 'regardless of the cost to the government's reputation'.
On October 3 the prime minister instructed Sir Robin to follow up all the
allegations with the ministers concerned.
Sir Robin had conversations with the ministers the week before the
Conservative party conference. On Monday October 17, after his return from
Bournemouth, Mr Major concluded that he should accept the resignation of Mr
Tim Smith, the junior Northern Ireland minister.
Before this happened, however, allegations that Mr Smith and Mr Neil
Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, were paid to raise questions in
the Commons on Mr Fayed's behalf were published in The Guardian newspaper.
Mr Smith told Sir Robin that he received payments from Mr Fayed between 1987
and 1989 without declaring the information in the Register of Members
Interests until just before the end of that period. The report said: 'He
acknowledged that he should have done so earlier.'
According to Sir Robin Mr Hamilton emphatically denied throughout his
inquiries that he had received any payments deriving from Mr Fayed. 'I have
found no evidence which controverts Mr Hamilton's assurances on these
matters,' Sir Robin wrote.
Mr Hamilton confirmed that he had received hospitality from Mr Fayed 'as a
private guest, as he believed' before entering the government. He had,
however, not thought it necessary to declare it in the register of
interests.
The report said that when Mr Hamilton became a DTI minister he declared his
previous interest in matters concerning Mr Fayed and stood aside from any
involvement as a minister in issues concerning the House of Fraser store
group, which includes Harrods.
Concerning the other allegations made by the informant, Sir Robin said he
had looked at them 'so far as I am able' and had put them to the ministers
concerned. 'In some of them there are patent inaccuracies and all have been
denied explicitly, unequivocally and in writing,' Sir Robin wrote.
He added: 'The fact that there is reason to think that these allegations too
have now been made available to others who have so far chosen not to publish
them suggests that they too may have found that there is a lack of evidence
to establish their validity.'
Sir Robin does not list the names of all the ministers concerned, nor the
allegations made against them. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary,
confirmed yesterday that he was one of the ministers. He said he had 'never
been guilty of any impropriety' as a minister or MP.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Inquiry puts MPs' little earners in
the spotlight - The remit of the latest investigation of standards in public
life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that his proposed
committee of inquiry was the 'widest-ranging inquiry into standards in
public life since the second world war'.
This is a dubious claim. A royal commission sat for two years in the 1970s
to investigate standards of conduct in public life.
As with Mr Major's inquiry, it was chaired by a law lord, Lord Salmon,
included nominees of the main political parties and non-party experts, and
had a remit incorporating central government, local government and other
public bodies.
The background to the Salmon commission was the Poulson affair - a
long-running case of sleaze far more serious than any yet alleged in public
by Mr Mohamed Fayed, or by those critical of the activities of unelected
quangos.
For nearly 20 years Mr John Poulson's architecture and construction empire
manipulated a web of corrupt officials in local government, the police and
the National Health Service, which was revealed when he went bankrupt in
1972. Mr Poulson and several local councillors and officials were convicted
of corruption.
The Salmon commission was concerned mainly with corruption in local
government. It recommended a range of reforms, notably declarations and
registers of interest, which have since been instituted.
It is the breach of the rules governing one such register of interests -
that for MPs - which is a key issue in the present controversy.
The Salmon report had little to say about central government and the
Commons, which were only incidental to the Poulson affair, or about the way
appointments were made to public bodies. It accepted implicitly that
parliament should regulate itself.
Lord Nolan's committee will not start with the same assumptions. It faces
calls from across the political spectrum for MPs to be subject to some form
of code of conduct, and growing unease about the way appointments are made
to public bodies.
Lord Nolan said last night that he supported hearings that were in public.
He said: 'I've grown up doing my work in open court in public and that is
how I would prefer to go forward.'
As Lord Justice Nolan he assisted in the Appeal Court decision which found
Mr Kenneth Baker, then home secretary, guilty of contempt after he failed to
respond to an order to return an unlawfully deported asylum-seeker to
Britain.
Lord Nolan's committee has six months to grapple with a range of issues. The
most important are:
MPs and outside interests. Until recently few questioned the right of MPs to
accept paid work outside the Commons. Indeed the practice is widely defended
as desirable to give MPs a feel for the 'outside world' and to supplement a
salary - now Pounds 31,687 - below that which many enjoyed before they were
elected. The question has been the disclosure of outside payments.
There are now calls for tighter rules to be placed on outside interests. Mr
Vernon Bogdanor, reader in government at Oxford University, said: 'The Nolan
committee needs to look carefully at whether MPs should have outside
incomes. Their job is to serve their constituents, and it is a bogus
argument to claim that they can only learn about the 'outside world' by
being a paid consultant.'
The implications are stark. More than than 200 MPs out of the 651 are
employed as parliamentary consultants to lobbying companies and other
commercial organisations - often at a fee of Pounds 10,000 or more per
consultancy per year.
The appointment of members of public bodies. Ministers have largely
unfettered discretion over appointments they make to public bodies. Until
1979, however, ministers generally offered fair representation to the main
opposition party.
The breakdown of this tacit agreement accounts for much of the current
acrimony. Entrenched in office, the governments of Mrs Thatcher and Mr Major
have paid less regard to the claims of opposition parties for appointments.
The resentment has been exacerbated by the growth of quangos, such as NHS
trusts, strongly opposed by Labour.
Options for change include placing obligations on ministers to offer a
certain proportion of appointments to opposition parties, or the
establishment of a vetting body to ensure the quality and fairness of
appointments.
Complaints against MPs. Members of the public aggrieved with their local
council - or with many other public bodies - can appeal to an ombudsman.
There is no such recourse for those dissatisfied with the service given to
them by their MP - or for those who believe that their MP is not declaring
his or her interests.
One reform which has attracted support would be to establish an ombudsman to
oversee the work of MPs - perhaps in conjunction with a formal code of
conduct.
Any such move would probably be opposed by MPs. Since King Charles I's
attempts to arrest five MPs in 1642 they have fought tenaciously against any
form of outside interference.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tories accused on health trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow health secretary, last night accused the
government of packing hospital trusts with supporters of the Conservative
party and privatising the National Health Service by stealth.
She said 66 of the self-governing trusts were chaired either by a Tory or by
someone connected with a company which had made donations to the
Conservative party.
The charges were strongly rebutted in the Commons by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, who confirmed that the trusts could be examined by the new
committee which was to scrutinise the standards of conduct of all holders of
public office.
Mrs Bottomley said that the outcome would be a recognition that the new
management bodies established in the NHS were 'models to follow'.
Mrs Beckett called for a central register of quangos and a register listing
every NHS trust board member and their qualifications.
The shadow health secretary, who branded Mrs Bottomley the 'Madame Mao' of
the health service, said trust boards were overwhelmingly packed with
'representatives of Conservative interests'.
One third of the places were held by directors of private companies, while
others were filled by solicitors and accountants. Only 4 per cent to 6 per
cent of those appointed had experience of the NHS.
The government won a majority of 34 (297-263) to defeat a Labour motion
endorsing 'public alarm' at the creeping privatisation of the NHS.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Committee set up to combat sleaze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday tried to staunch the continuing allegations of
sleaze against Conservative MPs by announcing that an independent law lord
is to head a new committee to examine standards of conduct in public life.
Amid continuing allegations that MPs were paid by companies to ask
parliamentary questions, the prime minister said the committee, to be headed
by Lord Nolan, would contain nominees from the three main political parties
and would produce its first report within six months.
Mr Major said in a statement to the Commons that Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary, had completed an investigation into specific allegations
made by Mr Mohammed Fayed, the chairman of Harrods, that ministers were paid
to ask questions on his behalf.
He said Sir Robin had found 'no evidence' that Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior
minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, had been guilty of such
actions.
However, he told MPs that other allegations had been made since Sir Robin
had completed his report, and that he had to consider whether they prevented
Mr Hamilton from carrying out his responsibilities as a minister. 'I believe
they do,' Mr Major said, 'and he agrees and has resigned from the
government.'
In announcing the creation of the committee Mr Major said there was public
disquiet about standards in public life and that action to deal with the
problem was now 'imperative'.
He had therefore decided to set up a body whose terms of reference would be
to 'examine current concerns about standards of conduct in public office,
including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and
make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might
be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety.'
Mr Major added: 'This country has an international reputation for the
integrity and honour of its public institutions. That reputation must be
maintained and seen to be maintained.'
The prime minister said the committee would look at the responsibility of a
range of public office holders, including:
Ministers, civil servants and their advisers.
MPs and members of the European parliament.
Members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies and NHS
bodies and non-ministerial office holders.
Non-ministerial office holders.
Members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly
funded functions.
Elected members and senior officers of local authorities.
He gave an assurance that the committee would examine whether cabinet
ministers could take up directorships in companies with which they had been
connected while in office, and that it would examine the privileges and
perks of appointees to quangos.
Mr Major admitted that he had considered creating several types of body to
carry out the investigation, including a royal commission, a committee of
privy counsellors and a Speaker's conference.
None of these had been deemed suitable, and he had chosen 'standing
machinery'. Apart from Lord Nolan, the committee would include the nominees
of the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders and other representatives.
Mr Major said it would be open to the committee to take evidence in public
or private, and that it would probably want to deliberate in private.
He added: 'I hope the committee will be able to produce at least a first
report covering the main areas of current concern within six months - and
then stay in being as a standing body to advise the government of the day.'
But he also made clear that he did not expect the body to replace the
Commons' own machinery, in particular the committee of privileges, which he
regarded as the 'the proper way to consider issues affecting individual
members of this house'.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, welcomed the creation of the new standing
committee, saying it was 'plainly sensible and necessary'.
He warned Mr Major, however, that the new body must investigate the
individual cases against ministers and MPs in the cash-for-questions affair.
Otherwise, he said, the Commons privileges committee, which is due to
investigate the allegations, should conduct its hearings in public.
He said: 'There will be justifiable public concern that the general inquiry
is being used to sweep the particular allegations from public view, when it
is these allegations that have given rise to the public concern.'
Mr Major failed to give Mr Blair this assurance. He said that Lord Nolan's
committee would 'restore confidence where confidence may have been lacking'
and that the privileges committee should continue to meet in private.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Hamilton forced out by 'foul rumour'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, said last night
that he had been forced to quit the government by 'foully motivated rumour
and a media witchhunt'.
Mr Hamilton said in a bitter letter to Mr John Major that the events
surrounding the prime minister's demand that he leave the government were
'sad and deeply disturbing'.
He said he had conducted himself with 'integrity and due regard for
propriety and probity' and had received no payments from Mr Mohamed Fayed,
the owner of Harrods.
Mr Hamilton thanked Mr Major for confirming in the Commons that allegations
of impropriety made against him were unsubstantiated. He said he would clear
his name.
In his response Mr Major said he was sorry for the way Mr Hamilton's
ministerial career had ended and praised his work at the Department of Trade
and Industry. He said: 'I am grateful to you for the readiness with which
you recognised that it was impossible for you to continue in government in
the circumstances.'
The letters were released amid a mixture of relief among mainstream
Conservatives and anger among rightwingers. MPs on all sides were confused
by the day's events.
Initially it was assumed Mr Hamilton had been forced to quit because of a
defiant statement issued to newspapers in his Cheshire constituency.
The prime minister's disclosure to the Commons that he had agreed to resign
because of the impact of fresh allegations made on Monday stunned MPs.
At no time yesterday did Mr Major detail the new allegations against Mr
Hamilton, but senior government sources confirmed they did not relate to Mr
Hamilton's connection with Mr Fayed.
Mr John Carlisle, the MP for Luton North, said: 'The prime minister is
attempting to resurrect a situation which has gone a bit out of control, but
I don't agree with the way he has gone about it.'
Mr Alan Duncan, another rightwinger, said: 'He was a colourful and a
competent minister. There is a sad irony that he has gone on the day that
the spotlight has moved to the questionable conduct of the man who accused
him.'
Mr Hamilton, a witty rightwinger, had earlier appeared determined to fight
on against allegations that he asked Commons questions for Mr Fayed in
return for cash and a week at the Paris Ritz.
In a statement issued in his constituency he said he was dismayed by the
'wild and false accusations' against him - comments regarded by most Tory
MPs as typically robust.
But there was widespread dismay and embarrassment about his reasons for
refusing to leave office to pursue a libel action against The Guardian.
He said: 'Of course I could resign and fight a libel action from the back
benches. But the same argument could have applied to the prime minister in
respect of his action against the scurrilous Scallywag magazine, or against
other ministers who have fought libel actions.
'There is no reason whatsoever why a minister of the crown should not remain
in office whilst undertaking libel proceedings. Indeed the prime minister
did just that - and quite rightly so,' he said.
Many Tory MPs were aghast at his reference to Mr Major's successful libel
action against the New Statesman magazine, which reported unfounded
allegations in Scallywag that the prime minister had had an extra-marital
affair.
When it emerged in mid-morning that Mr Hamilton had cancelled an engagement
and was returning to London it was widely assumed that he was about to be
sacked for issuing the statement without government approval.
In fact, Mr Hamilton was summoned by Mr Richard Ryder, government chief
whip. He was informed of the fresh allegations and agreed to quit.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Most life groups welcome watchdog's plan to help victims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several leading life companies yesterday offered a cautious welcome to SIB's
two-year plan to help victims of pension mis-selling.
But Legal &amp; General, one of the largest, attacked the plan. Mr David
Prosser, chief executive, said: 'We believe that SIB is unfairly putting too
great a burden of the costs of resolving the issue on the life assurance
industry.'
In a reference to the role of occupational pension schemes, he added: 'This
is a pensions-industry problem which should have been funded by the whole of
the pensions industry.'
Mr Prosser said Legal &amp; General would make additional provisions to take
account of administrative costs and possible liabilities for compensating
customers of independent advisers which had gone out of business.
Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society,
warned that many smaller independent financial advisers might be forced out
of business. Last year the society set aside Pounds 5m as provision against
past errors, and is to commit a similar amount this year.
Mr Lister also focused on the responsibilities of occupational schemes,
calling on them to support SIB's hope that they 'will be reasonable in their
demands when it comes to reinstating transfers and opt-outs'. He added:
'Otherwise I fear the IFA sector will become solely the preserve of larger
organisations like ourselves.'
NPI, a mutual insurer which specialises in pensions, was similarly concerned
that smaller advisers could be forced out of business by the administrative
costs of the plan and hoped that the larger insurers would help. However, it
said the overall compensation figure was likely to be 'not terribly
significant' in terms of the size of the sector.
Mr David Davies of Pearl Assurance said: 'The guidelines appear to strike a
sensible balance between the need to resolve priority cases quickly and to
recognise that other clients may need their situations reviewed later.'
Pearl had started work a year ago to identify its share of cases, he said,
and had conducted 7,000 interviews out of a total of 38,000 customers who
took an opt-out.
But the timescale for SIB's review was attacked by the Consumers'
Association, which said that too many people advised to take out personal
pensions faced financial uncertainty for too long. Some of the unions whose
members may have been affected, including the GMB general union and the
Association of Lecturers and Teachers, expressed similar concerns.
Prudential, which has insisted that it does not have a problem with opt-outs
or transfers, reiterated that sales staff were forbidden to sell opt-outs
and that it did not need to make provision in its accounts against possible
compensation claims.
TSB, the banking and insurance group, said the report would 'help in
rebuilding customer confidence'.
Mr Kevin Wesbroom, a partner with consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said
several factors might have produced the high estimates of potential opt-out
and transfer cases, including general concern about pensions after the
Maxwell affair, the withdrawal from pension schemes of those made redundant,
and an exodus from the pension funds of declining industries.
Asked if life companies would comply with the proposal he said: 'I don't
think they have any choice - although a few will squeal.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Pension claimants face complicated procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The process set out yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's chief regulator, for compensating people who bought personal pensions
on poor advice is as complex as the transactions it deals with.
It involves detailed procedures and complicated calculations. This is how it
should work.
Deciding which opt-out cases should be reviewed, and when.
SIB has identified priorities among the estimated 800,000 people who have
opted out or not joined an employers' scheme, and has set dates by which
most of the 250,000 cases in these categories should have been reviewed.
The priorities are:
Retired or dead investors, and people who were 35 or more when they opted
out and are still with the same employer. Target date: end-1995.
People who opted out when they were under 35, are still in the same job and
making personal pension contributions. People who did not join an employer's
scheme and were 35 or more when they bought a personal pension, and are
still in the same job and making personal pension contributions. Target
date: mid-1996.
People who opted out when they were 35 or more and are no longer with the
same employer. Target date: end-1996.
Deciding which pension transfer cases should be reviewed.
SIB says that because there are circumstances in which transferring a lump
sum from a pension scheme will not have caused harm to the investor, only
about 100,000 of these 600,000 investors automatically need to be contacted.
The priorities are:
Retired or dead investors, and men 55-plus and women 50-plus at the time of
the transaction. Target date: end-1995.
Men aged 50 to 54 and women aged 45 to 49 at the time of the transaction.
Target date: end-1996.
Any non-priority investor can also ask their life company or adviser to
review their case within two years.
Identifying cases where people took out personal pensions and opted out or
did not join their employers' schemes.
With some understatement, SIB calls this a 'major administrative task'.
Each life insurance company or independent adviser should send a simple
questionnaire, devised by SIB, to every employed person to whom it sold a
personal pension. If a company has gone out of business then the pensions
unit set up by the Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect
the private investor, will take on the task.
Getting the information on both opt-outs and transfers.
SIB says companies and advisers must get the facts, even where records have
not been kept. This will often mean they should get in touch directly with
the investor and with the occupational pension schemes.
Small firms of independent advisers can ask the PIA pensions unit to carry
out its administration, in return for a fee.
Deciding whether the investor should get compensation.
SIB says that without using hindsight the question here is whether the sales
agent or adviser failed to meet regulators' requirements in a way which
affected the investor's decision, causing actual or potential loss. An
example might be whether the customer did not have enough information to
make an informed decision.
Providing compensation.
SIB urges occupational schemes to take back people who have opted out, and
to allow readmission of those who decided on poor advice not to join.
Several schemes sound sympathetic. Where they are not, the life company or
adviser would top up the personal pension so that, at retirement, the
benefits that the occupational scheme would have offered can be replicated.
In transfers, where occupational schemes are much less likely to allow
investors back in, a top-up would also be SIB's preferred method of
compensation.
Only where someone has already retired would compensation be an immediate
cash sum.
Those companies that sold the personal pensions will have to pay for
compensating their own customers where necessary. If - in the case of small
independent advisers - this proves beyond them, or they have already gone
out of business, the bill will be paid from the Investors' Compensation
Scheme, up to a maximum of Pounds 48,000 in any one case. The ICS is funded
by the financial services industry.
Deciding whether compensation is fair.
The regulators are issuing guidelines about how the compensation should be
calculated. In offering compensation to investors a life company or adviser
will have to say whether its offer was calculated on that basis and, if not,
why not.
They will also have to remind investors that they should consider their
position very carefully if they are in any doubt, and tell them about the
company complaints procedure.
In practice, where disputes arise and customers do not want to go to court,
they will have access to the PIA ombudsman scheme.
Monitoring the process.
Life companies and advisers will have their case reviews checked by their
regulators - primarily the PIA. They could be disciplined if they are
misleading or incompetent.
The SIB leaflet for investors is available from libraries and Citizens
Advice Bureaux or by sending a large stamped, addressed envelope to:
Pensions Factsheet, PO Box 701, Basildon, Essex SS14 3FD. The PIA pensions
unit can be contacted on 071 417 7001, fax 071 417 8100.

<TEXT>
International investment banks and advisers to the pension schemes formerly
controlled by the late Robert Maxwell have been given until November 4 to
make an offer of restitution, Norma Cohen writes.
Sir Peter Webster, the former High Court judge appointed to help find a
'global solution' to the shortfall in Maxwell pension scheme assets, met
trustees and advisers to most of the schemes yesterday. Sir Peter said he
hoped the plan would raise enough for each scheme to meet its liabilities in
full.
Sir Peter has been working since last spring to find ways of allowing
investment banks and advisers to make restitution without implicitly
admitting wrongdoing.
Those which do not make reasonable offers by November 4 risk legal action by
the pension schemes. It is understood that several schemes have prepared
writs, which have not yet been served, seeking millions of pounds.
Sir Peter is understood to have told trustees that participants in the
solution are likely to set conditions on their contributions. In particular,
they will seek confidentiality and a guarantee that no further claims be
made against them.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Information groups warned on multimedia hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications and computer companies which have formed alliances and
invested heavily in anticipation of a booming market for multimedia in the
home may have been ill-advised, a research organisation has warned.
Inteco says that the revenues from domestic multi-media services in Europe
will not flow appreciably until the turn of the century. Organisations such
as the telephone and cable companies now investing in new services such as
video-on-demand and the infrastructure to support them will suffer losses,
it says.
It concludes that assumptions about European acceptance of multimedia based
on US experience are dangerously misguided. Mr Miles Thistlethwaite, who
co-ordinated the study for Inteco, said: 'The US model does not work for any
of the European countries.'
He added: 'There are fundamental differences in the cable and satellite
landscape as well as in patterns of behaviour.' He did not believe those
patterns could easily be changed.
Multimedia implies the integration of telecommunications with computer
technology to deliver interactive services. This includes video-on-demand,
home shopping and on-line information.
The study involved 11,500 interviews with households in France, Germany,
Italy and the UK. Its principal conclusions echo the views of many who have
questioned the commercial feasibility of the multi-media revolution. It is
the first survey on such a scale, however, to cast doubt on the potential
profitability of the information superhighway.
Mr Thistlethwaite said that the object had been to identify patterns of
behaviour which could be used to predict the acceptability and
attractiveness of various aspects of multimedia.
It found big differences between the US and Europe and equally big
differences between the main European countries in their attitude to
multimedia.
In the US, for example, two-thirds of households with video recorders rented
a video tape at least once a month, almost invariably from the 'top 10'
movies on offer. In Europe the comparable figure was 22 per cent and the
tape was rarely chosen from the top 10.
A significant conclusion is that the personal computer rather than the
television is likely to be the focus for multimedia services. The study
says: 'Those services that people will be most ready to pay hard cash for
are likely to be those centred on the PC.'
These include interactive compact discs, especially those with educational
content, which Inteco sees as important in the better-off homes with
children of school age. 'Video-on-demand, on-line information and home
shopping interest consumers and could bring in additional revenues but by
themselves are unlikely to prompt people into subscribing in the first
place,' it says.
Inteco says the UK is the best test-bed for multimedia products and services
because it is most deregulated.

FT  26 OCT 94 / London-wide co-ordination of buses urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some central control of London's buses will still be needed after
privatisation to ensure that they continue to provide an efficient service,
the Chartered Institute of Transport said yesterday.
The institute, which represents people working in the transport sector, said
in a report that priority measures such as special bus lanes would need to
be co-ordinated on a London-wide basis by local authorities and the bus
companies.
There would also be a pivotal role for London Transport in setting standards
for infrastructure such as stations, stops and shelters, in providing
passenger information, and supervising ticketing arrangements which allow
passengers to make journeys on buses owned by different companies.
Six of the 10 companies which make up London Buses have been sold in the
past two months. Completion of privatisation is expected before the end of
the year.
The institute said local authorities should adopt traffic schemes which gave
priority to buses. This would increase bus use, reduce congestion and cut
environmental pollution.
It urged the government to modify the system of tendering for bus contracts.
When an existing operator lost a contract it could face large redundancy
costs. The institute suggested that 'some marginal preference' for existing
operators could provide for greater continuity without discouraging
competitive bids for routes.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Scientists predict tiny processors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers yesterday announced a breakthrough in electronic miniaturisation
which could lead to computer memories and microprocessors 500 times faster
than today's silicon chips and one-five hundredth the size.
Scientists at Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre and Cambridge University
have developed the world's first process for making 'quantum effect
integrated circuits'. These devices consist of millions of microscopically
small components on a chip the size of a fingernail.
Professor Michael Pepper, managing director of the research centre, said
that the achievement was of comparable significance to the discovery in 1958
of the technology for making integrated circuits on silicon instead of
connecting together individual transistors. That breakthrough led to the
information technology revolution which started in the early 1970s and is
still gathering pace.
Many electronics laboratories have made such microscopic components,
including 'quantum wires' one-hundred thousandth the thickness of human
hair. But their individual production is painstakingly slow and expensive.
The microscopic components - no more than 10 atoms across - are so small
that the electrons in them behave both as particles and waves, in accordance
with the bizarre predictions of quantum theory. This allows the circuits to
switch far faster than those in conventional chips.
The Toshiba process makes it possible to mass produce them on integrated
circuits like conventional chips. The process has several stages and is
technically complex, but Prof Pepper said it was 'highly manufacturable and
could readily be transferred to a production environment' at reasonable
cost.
The main technical barrier to overcome is that the quantum devices can only
operate when cooled in liquid helium to temperatures close to absolute zero.
Scientists can, however, foresee them being developed to work at room
temperature.
Chips based on the technology could reach the market in about 10 years.
There are many possible applications, including super-fast memory and logic
circuits for computers and more precisely controllable lasers.
Mr Sei-Ichi Takayanagi, Toshiba's senior adviser on research, said the
technology was still too far from the market to transfer to the company's
Japanese research and development laboratories. It would be developed in
Cambridge for about five years - and licensed to any other companies that
wanted to use it.
Prof Pepper predicted that many new applications would emerge which no one
had yet thought of. He said: 'Think of all the changes in computing and
communications in the last 25 years, and try to extrapolate those 25 years
ahead.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Unpopular counties killed off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avon and Humberside county councils, two creations of the 1974
reorganisation, will be abolished in 1996 as part of the local government
review.
The announcement, made yesterday by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary,
had been widely predicted, as the 1974 counties were thought to be
unpopular.
Unitary authorities, combining the powers now held by county and district
councils, will be formed in their place. In Avon, Bristol will become a
unitary council, while Bath will merge with the surrounding Wandsdyke
district, and Northavon with Kingswood, to form new merged unitaries.
Woodspring district, centred on Weston-super-Mare, will become a unitary on
its current boundaries.
In Humberside Mr Gummer has slightly altered the proposals made by the Local
Government Commission. Hull will become a unitary council, as seems likely
to happen with most of England's provincial cities, but Mr Gummer suggests
that its present boundaries should be extended, a provision not made by the
commission.
The remainder of Humberside north of the Humber will become one large
unitary, to be known as East Yorkshire.
South of the Humber the towns of Scunthorpe and Grimsby will merge with the
more rural district councils that surround them to form two new unitaries.
In North Yorkshire Mr Gummer has made significant changes to the blueprint
presented to him by the commission. York will be given extended boundaries
and become a unitary, in line with the commission's propo-sals.
But the proposal to amalgamate all the other districts of North Yorkshire
into two unitary 'ridings' has been dropped, after fierce opposition from
local MPs. Instead, North Yorkshire outside York will continue with two
tiers as at present. Proposals to merge Goole with Yorkshire have also been
dropped.
In Somerset the commission's proposal to create three unitary authorities
has been abandoned, while Mr Gummer did not to ask the commission to
reconsider its proposal that Lincolnshire should remain untouched, with two
tiers of local government.
Nine unitary authorities will be created, with a total population of
slightly more than 1.9m. The commission said that the counties of Avon and
Humberside had 'never been supported generally by local residents, who
clearly wanted change'.
Mr Gummer defended the decision to create unitaries in some areas but to
leave two tiers intact elsewhere.
Compulsory competitive tendering of English local authorities' information
technology services has been postponed by a year and will not now start
until October 1997, the Department of the Environment announced yesterday.
At that point metropolitan authorities and councils which avoid
reorganisation in the local government review must expose 70 per cent by
value of their information technology work to competition.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Elected 'senate' to unite engineering profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 13-year-old Engineering Council is to be replaced with an elected
'senate', creating a united engineering profession.
Yesterday's announcement is an important breakthrough in a three-year battle
by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council.
Sir John announced a proposal that would create a body to bring together the
views of the institutions, industry and academia and provide a single voice
for the profession.
The plan was warmly welcomed last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary.
Mr Heseltine said: 'A unified body will give the engineering profession the
single influential voice it badly needs.'
The council is the umbrella body for 41 professional institutions, but many
engineers believe it has failed to provide an effective voice for the
profession. Bigger institutions have been wary of conceding too much power
to it.
After several months of discussions in a policy group set up in September
last year the breakthrough came with the development of a proposal for a
democratically elected 'senate' to be the focal point for the profession.
The senate would have two boards, one for the regulation of the profession
and the other for its promotion. Board members would be selected from the
54-strong senate, 24 of whose members would be elected by institution
councils from their past and present council members, 24 by engineers and
technicians, and six appointed by the Privy Council.
The proposals have been unanimously endorsed by the policy group, and by a
meeting of the council of institution presidents. Sir John said yesterday:
'I am very optimistic.' He hopes that all the institutions will sign a
declaration supporting the proposal by the end of January, allowing the new
arrangements to be in place by the middle of next year.
It will have to appoint a director-general. Mr Denis Filer, the council's
director-general, who is due to have retired, is to see the council through
its transition.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Unit trust sales fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of unit trusts fell sharply last month to a net Pounds 470.7m, the
second-lowest figure this year and almost 40 per cent down on August's net
sales of Pounds 767.1m.
Sales for the third quarter were also down, to Pounds 1.88bn from Pounds
2.81bn the previous quarter. The third quarter is traditionally one of the
weakest for sales but the figure was also substantially lower than the
corresponding period last year when net sales totalled Pounds 2.61bn.
However, net sales of unit trusts for the year are still higher than for the
same period last year.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Call to delay new Forth road bridge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was urged yesterday to postpone for five years a decision on
building a second Forth road bridge. Instead, said Lothian Regional Council,
it should raise tolls on the existing road bridge to finance transport
improvements which might make a second bridge unnecessary.
The council, which covers the area on the south side of the Firth of Forth,
was replying to feasibility studies published by the Scottish Office that
present a strong case for a second Forth road bridge.
The government is expected to announce before the end of the year that it
wants to go ahead with the project, which would be financed by the private
sector.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Atlantic Computers collapse probed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An investigation is to be held into the conduct of certain accountants and
companies connected with the collapse of Atlantic Computers in 1990.
The probe follows the report into the collapse by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
In 1988 Atlantic was acquired by British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings. Both later
collapsed, with Atlantic owing Pounds 279m.
If counsel for the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary Scheme finds
grounds for a complaint a tribunal will be set up to hear evidence and
publish a report - only then would members or companies be named.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Consumer bad debt problems reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad debt problems among consumers are receding, says a survey by credit
information group Equifax Europe, Philip Coggan writes.
The survey found that 7.1 per cent of instalment credit accounts were in
arrears in the third quarter, down from 9 per cent in the same period last
year.
There was a smaller fall in accounts significantly in arrears - defined as
those three or more months behind in payments - to 3.5 per cent in the third
quarter from 3.7 per cent in the same period last year.
Equifax's figures cover instalment credit, including credit cards, from
finance houses, banks, building societies and other businesses such as the
motor trade.
According to the survey Northern Ireland is the region with the lowest level
of bad debt, with only 5.6 per cent of consumers in arrears.
Scotland has the highest bad-debt level, with 8.4 per cent of consumers
behind with payments.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Coal licensing body launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Coal Authority, which will take over the ownership and licensing of
coal from British Coal, was launched yesterday as a further step to
privatisation of the industry.
Mr Charles Wardle, the junior energy minister, described it as 'the start of
a new era for coalmining'.
The new authority, based in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, has the task of
encouraging 'viable coalmining and coal-bed methane operations' and
providing safeguards for the public. It will also license mining operations,
ensuring that mining companies make adequate provision to cover possible
subsidence claims.
The licences of mine owners will be reviewed annually by the authority and
it will cancel those of any private operators which fail to meet required
standards.
The authority will be responsible for subsidence claims outside areas of
current mining. It is estimated that there are as many as 200,000 abandoned
mine shafts in the UK.
The authority will have a staff of about 100 and an annual budget of about
Pounds 50m, which will come in the form of grant-in-aid from the Department
of Trade and Industry.
The authority will be expected to recoup its costs wherever it can, and to
earn revenue through licence fees on a scale which will be announced later
this week.
Sir David White, the chairman, said he wanted 'to create an authority that
is responsive to those who want to mine'. He said much of its work would be
outsourced to private contractors.
The authority's chief executive is Mr Neville Washington, a former army
officer.
The authority takes over British Coal's duties next Monday, although British
Coal will survive as an entity until all its liabilities have been settled.
The government hopes to complete the privatisation by Christmas day.

FT  26 OCT 94 / BT3 share sale methods backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, yesterday endorsed
the methods used by investment bank SG Warburg to co-ordinate the sale of
the government's remaining stake in British Telecommunications last year.
The tactics attracted strong criticism from institutions. They objected to
Warburg's efforts to prevent the sale of new shares to those who disposed of
shares or sold shares they did not own immediately before the BT3 global
offering.
Warburg had used a variation of the so-called global bookbuilding technique,
in which the price at which the new shares are sold reflects market demand
on the day of the offering. There have been suggestions that in similar
bookbuilding operations in London investors manipulated share prices by
dumping stock or selling short immediately before pricing. This would have
allowed them to buy the new shares more cheaply.
Warburg tried to ensure that those who had recently sold BT shares were not
allocated new shares.
The study found that Warburg won 36 per cent of the Pounds 20m of
commissions from the international portion of the offering, down from 41 per
cent of commissions on BT2.
The watchdog praised the techniques used in the BT3 offering, and said that
77 of 78 institutional investors interviewed regarded the sale as a success.
Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, said the sale had raised
Pounds 5.2bn, in line with Treasury expectations.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Telecoms union supports pay test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications plans to introduce team-based performance-related
pay for nearly 30,000 engineers if an experiment in the Nottingham/Derby
area succeeds.
The company hopes that between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of an engineer's
pay will be based on performance appraisal. The main BT union, the National
Communications Union, is cautious about performance pay but has backed the
experiment involving 100 of its members.
The experiment is linked to other changes in working time and introduces the
idea of engineers acting as part of the salesforce, with commission paid for
any new business that they pass on from a customer.
During the trial individuals will receive a Pounds 100-a-month bonus in lieu
of overtime.
The experiment comes at a difficult time for the union, which has faced
criticism from activists over the acceptance of a new system of flexible
working time.
BT's experience with performance pay for managerial grades has been an
uncomfortable one. After various experiments since the late 1980s a new
system was introduced in May last year, only to be abandoned this year when
it threatened to become too expensive.
A provisional system introduced for managers paid about 80 per cent of them
an unconsolidated bonus.

FT  26 OCT 94 / First oil produced west of Shetland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP and Shell said yesterday that they had produced the first oil from the
Atlantic west of Shetland.
In a six-week extended test of their new Foinaven field the well flowed at
up to 20,000 barrels a day, with an average flow of 17,800 barrels.
On completion of the test a cargo of oil was taken to BP's refinery in
Rotterdam.
In addition to being the first oil produced and saved from the area, it was
the first production from 500m under water, and the highest flow rate
achieved in the area.
Foinaven and its neighbouring Schiehallion field are among the biggest new
oil and gas discoveries in UK waters. The two wells could account for 30 per
cent of the UK's known reserves, with production amounting to a similar
proportion of the UK's total output when they are fully developed.
In August Shell and BP placed contracts with a consortium of
McDermott/Golar-Nor for a floating production system for the first phase of
Foinaven development.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Warning on threat to peace in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hardline extremists could try to derail the Northern Ireland peace process,
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, warned yesterday.
In comments made in Northern Ireland within hours of the reported abduction
of the son of an ex-Sinn Fein councillor, Sir Patrick called for 'the
greatest restraint and self-discipline' from all concerned. Those trying to
provoke a return to violence 'must not succeed', he said.
Sir Patrick said: 'I don't know if it's the case in this instance, but we
must expect there will be people who don't wish to see an end to violence
and who will be trying to provoke a return to violence.
'Whenever peace comes after a long period of conflict there is a risk
hardline extremists will try and provoke a return to violence.'
The disappearance of Mr Paul Carroll was the first apparently politically
motivated incident in Northern Ireland since the declaration of a loyalist
ceasefire two weeks ago.
Last night the mystery surrounding Mr Carroll deepened when his father said
that his son was 'in safe hands' and was in hiding from the police because
he was an informer.
Mr Tommy Carroll contradicted an earlier statement by members of his family
that his son had been abducted from his home against his will by masked men.
Police sources in Armagh City said that Mr Carroll had no terrorist
convictions and was not known to be linked with any terrorist organisation.
However, because of the staunchly republican credentials of members of his
family, police were working on the theory that he may have been abducted as
part of an internal feud possibly linked to the IRA.
Two of Mr Carroll's uncles were shot in separate terrorist-related incidents
in the 1980s. Roddy Carroll, a member of the INLA, an extremist group that
split from the IRA, was shot by police allegedly involved in a shoot-to-kill
policy. A second uncle, Adrian, was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries.
Loyalist politicians representing Protestant paramilitaries were in New York
yesterday. They were expected to meet low-ranking administration officials.
The loyalists, led by Mr Gusty Spence, a former paramilitary and a convicted
murderer, and Mr David Ervine, who has also been in prison on bomb-related
offences, said they were prepared to meet with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing.
The loyalist groups, unlike constitutional unionist parties, have no
misgivings about Dublin's proposed cross-border institutions, as long as it
is not a 'Trojan horse leading to a united Ireland'.
Yesterday's events came as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
told the Dail that the framework document with which the two governments
hope to inject momentum into talks involving Ulster's main political parties
on the province's future had to strike a 'very fine balance'.
Meanwhile, Ms Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, Irish justice minister, told the Dail
the government would act soon to scrap the republic's state of emergency,
effectively available as an anti-IRA measure for more than half a century.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Heathrow tunnel collapse delays work a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work on the collapsed section of tunnel under Terminal Three at Heathrow
airport, London, is unlikely to resume for at least a month, BAA, the
airport operator said yesterday.
A preliminary investigation into the causes of the collapse, which has
brought traffic chaos around the airport, is expected to take 10 days.
Balfour Beatty, and BAA, will take up to three more weeks to decide what
action can be taken.
BAA said that although travellers might have difficulties getting to
Heathrow, the tunnel workings posed no threat to the operations of the
airport or the airlines using it.
The controversial 'new Austrian tunnelling method' is being used on only two
short sections, where stations are being built at the two terminal
complexes. Conventional boring methods are being used under runways and for
the rest of the 4 1/2 -mile tunnel.
The problems at Heathrow started on Friday when earth began slipping into
the tunnel near the Terminal Three car park during construction of the
Pounds 300m Heathrow express rail link to Paddington station.
Work has also been suspended on parts of the Jubilee Line extension to
London Underground where the Austrian method was being used. The
suspensions, at London Bridge and Waterloo, are likely to continue at least
until the findings of the preliminary investigation at Heathrow are known.
Concrete has been pumped into the collapsed section of the tunnel to
stabilise the ground and the office building above it, which was being used
as project headquarters for the tunnelling. BAA said the area was '95 per
cent stable'. Most of the multi-storey car park at Terminal Three, closed on
Friday, reopened yesterday.
The investigation team will be led by Mr David Williams, technical director
of BAA, and will involve three groups of consultants, Mott MacDonald,
Geoconsult and Ove Arup. BAA said: 'We won't be starting work for another
month on the site but work is continuing elsewhere,' Work at Heathrow
started in April. Tunnelling is still in its early stages with 180 metres
dug in the central area and work just starting north of the airport.
Work is due to be carried out from four sites at the airport but has yet to
start at the Terminal Four station, where the Austrian method will also be
used.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Westminster official lied, court told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former chief executive of Westminster city council was accused of lying
yesterday at the public hearings into alleged vote-rigging.
Mr Andrew Arden QC, representing the group of residents who have been
levelling the accusations, described prolonged correspondence between Mr
Bill Phillips, the council's managing director between 1987 and 1991, and Mr
Paul Dimoldenberg, then leader of the Labour group on the council.
Mr Arden said Mr Dimoldenberg was trying to find out why council money
appeared to be targeted at marginal wards at the expense of other areas.
But Mr Phillips denied that this was the case in a letter on May 24 1988.
He wrote: 'In short I have seen no evidence to support your assertions and I
will take this opportunity to tell you that I do not purvey 'clear untruths'
to anybody.'
Mr Arden said Mr Phillips was the council official who knew most about
secret vote-rigging plans.
He added that Mr Phillips' epitaph 'might be that he was a purveyor of fine
lies'.
Mr Phillips is one of 10 council officials and councillors named in the
district auditor's provisional report for wasting Pounds 21m on selling off
council homes in marginal wards before the 1990 local elections.
In a legal dispute yesterday Mr Anthony Scrivener, the QC retained by former
council leader Dame Shirley Porter, applied to call Mr Neale Coleman, one of
the objectors and former Labour housing spokesman on the council, as a
witness.
But Mr Arden said that Mr Coleman would not be able to shed any useful light
on the allegations since they concerned decisions taken in secret by
Conservative councillors.
He added that if Mr Coleman was called he might consider challenging a
previous ruling by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, that none of the 10
accused should be forced to give evidence at the hearing.
The hearing will not sit today.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Kuwait orders missiles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shorts, the Belfast-based aerospace company, has received a Pounds 50m order
for air defence missiles from Kuwait.
The announcement of the order came at the end of a visit to the emirate by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary.
Shorts said the contract would not affect plans to cut 240 jobs at its plant
in Belfast.
The order - for the Starburst shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missile - was
said to be a surprise to the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Export
Services Organisation and Shorts.
Starburst - the immediate successor to the Javelin system, which Shorts has
sold to more than 10 countries - has been developed to destroy
high-performance low-flying aircraft as well as helicopters.

FT  26 OCT 94 / EU fails to limit animal journeys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European agriculture ministers in Luxembourg were again locked in stalemate
last night on the plan to limit journey times for animals being transported
for slaughter.
A compromise proposal from Germany, current EU president, to leave maximum
journey times at the discretion of member states met widespread
disagreement.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the deadlock
meant that 'millions of animals will continue to suffer long, unnecessary,
stressful journeys'.
The issue is extremely emotive with the British public, 56,000 of whom rang
the RSPCA supporting its recent full-page newspaper advertisements calling
for an eight-hour journey limit.
Ferry companies have introduced bans or restrictions on transporting live
animals to the Continent in response to a campaign by animal welfare groups.
They will maintain their bans unless European-wide agreement is reached.
Northern member states, which favour journey limits of between eight and 15
hours before animals are rested, remain at loggerheads with southern states,
which prefer a 22-hour limit.

<TEXT>
The 125 participants in the Uruguay Round of trade talks yesterday
reaffirmed their intention to establish the World Trade Organisation on
January 1 next year by setting a December date for the formal implementation
conference that must give the go-ahead.
The decision, by the WTO preparatory committee in Geneva, rests on the
assumption that the leading traders - the US, the European Union and Japan -
will ratify by the time of the implementation conference on December 8. Only
30 nations have ratified so far but 50 more are pledged to do so by the end
of the year.
Ratification has been held up partly because many countries are waiting for
the US, EU and Japan to do so.
In the US, the lame-duck Congress will return for a special session to vote
on the Uruguay Round implementing legislation after the November 8 mid-term
elections.
In the EU, ratification has been delayed by a dispute over the powers of the
European Commission to speak for member states on all WTO matters. The
European Court of Justice is due to pronounce on the issue on November 15.
Stephanie Flanders adds: The world's main trading nations should rise above
politics in picking a leader for the World Trade Organisation, Professor
Jagdish Bhagwati of New York's Columbia University said in London last night
at a memorial lecture for Harold Wincott, a former Financial Times
journalist.
Prof Bhagwati, a trade economist and former economic policy adviser to Gatt,
said the WTO would require 'intellectual leadership, not the skills of
political fixmanship.' Instead, 'we observe the main trading nations battle
to put their man in Geneva. It seems their chief desire is to pursue their
narrow political advantage and advance their preferred economic agenda.'

China

<TEXT>
The rivalry among industrial countries to promote commercial ties with China
will reach a new pitch next month when Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime
minister, leads a mission of almost 400 business leaders, politicians and
officials to Beijing.
The mission's ambitious scope is partly designed to deflect business
criticism that Ottawa has been slower than many other western governments to
recognise China's commercial potential. Canadian exports to China, totalling
CDollars 1.7bn (Dollars 1.25bn) in 1993, have stagnated in recent years. But
imports have risen rapidly, reaching CDollars 3.1bn last year.
Companies represented on the mission range from banks, law firms and
securities dealers, to metal producers, retailers and power utilities.
Besides Mr Chretien, the mission will include the premiers of nine of
Canada's ten provinces. The only absentee will be Mr Jacques Parizeau, who
heads the newly elected separatist government in Quebec.
The group will be in Beijing and Shanghai from November 6 to 10. It will
also visit Hong Kong and Vietnam. According to one organiser, the mission
will be used to announce 35-40 trade and investment deals worth about
CDollars 1bn, all at an 'advanced' stage of negotiations.
The two governments are expected to sign a nuclear co-operation agreement.
Atomic Energy of Canada hopes the accord will be a 'door-opener' for sales
of its Candu heavy-water reactors.
There is also to be a progress report on a venture between American Barrick
Resources, the Toronto-based gold producer, Power Corporation, the Montreal
investment holding company, and the China National Gold Corporation to
accelerate development of the gold-mining industry. The Barrick-Power
partnership has begun a pre-feasibility study of a deposit in Liaoning
province, and is discussing further projects.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Perot group in pledge drive against Gatt
deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
United We Stand, the network of activist citizens groups established by Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has launched a far-reaching drive to get
House and Senate candidates to sign a pledge to delay passage of the Uruguay
Round implementing legislation.
They are claiming two successes thus far: Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New
Jersey democrat, and Senator Harris Wofford, a Democrat for Pennsylvania.
Both have in their states large numbers of blue collar voters, who are
inclined to view trade liberalisation with suspicion.
Administration vote counters believe they have the votes to pass the
legislation this year. But they are nervous about the anti-Gatt efforts and
are urging US businesses to intensify their lobbying efforts as the mid-term
elections approaches. One official, who has been on the campaign trail, said
the anti-Nafta forces - populists on the left and right - have now
'coalesced' behind the Gatt.
United We Stand headquarters in Dallas, Texas, has recommended that local
groups urge consideration of the legislation in January 'to allow for a full
and open debate of Gatt/WTO's impact on jobs and sovereignty'.
This would make impossible the proposed launch of the World Trade
Organisation by January 1, 1995.
Mr Perot ran as an independent candidate for president in 1992 and is
expected to run again. He took the lead against the North American Free
Trade Agreement, debating Vice President Al Gore and in a performance widely
seen as hurting his cause.
In this battle, Mr Perot has thrown the thousands of citizen activists who
still flock to his banner. Although he has recommended that they vote for
Republicans, Democrats in tight races might well be inclined to take up the
anti-Gatt pledge in the hope of gaining - or at least neutralising -
opponents' advantages.
The 'Perotistas'' pledge does not ask for outright opposition to the Gatt
deal. Instead opponents are asking that Congress 'honour its own budget
responsibilities and provide full funding for any law it passes' a feat
which has been deemed politically impossible.
The administration was unable to raise the Dollars 40bn in programme cuts or
tax increases, required under Senate budget rules, to pay for lost tariff
revenue over 10 years. It found funding for the first five years but it is
being forced to ask for a waiver of the Senate rule, which would require 60
votes.

Spain and Germany have begun talks on equipping the Spanish army with
Leopard 2 tanks, potentially worth several hundred million dollars. Defence
officials in Madrid emphasised yesterday, however, that the choice of a new
tank to succeed US and French models was 'not closed'. Proposals under
discussion between the two defence ministries would involve assembly in
Spain and use of locally made components. This would require an agreement
with the Leopard's manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei. The German company,
controlled by the Mannesmann group, won a deal worth almost Dollars 800m
with Sweden earlier this year to supply 120 Leopard 2 tanks, with an option
for 80 more.

Foreign banks that will be allowed into the Philippines under the country's
liberalisation programme will be chosen from among the world's top 150 banks
only, according to newly issued guidelines from the monetary authorities. A
total of 31 foreign banks have signified interest in setting up shop in the
country. Only 10 will be allowed to open full-service branches, although
others may acquire up to 60 per cent of existing banks.
Mr Gabriel Singson, head of the central bank and its policy-setting Monetary
Board, says the selection should be completed in early 1995. Under the law,
six of the 10 banks will be selected by the Monetary Board, while the other
four will be picked by the Philippine president. The full-service banks will
be required to put up a minimum permanently assigned capital of 210m pesos
(Dollars 5.1m). They can open up to three branches in any location, and
another three in areas to be designated by the Monetary Board. The
guidelines provide that the home country of the applicant bank should extend
'reciprocity rights' to Philippine banks.

FT  26 OCT 94 / World Trade News: EU's export credit rules seen as threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brussels' plans to harmonise export credit within the European Union risk
imposing extra delay and red tape on European exporters just when they face
fiercer competition from the US, the leading French credit agency warned
yesterday.
Mr Francois David, president of Coface, the newly privatised agency which
underwrites a quarter of French exports, said it was 'not absurd to have a
common export credit policy'. This, he said, was particularly the case when
some of Europe's leading exporters were transnational companies, such as the
four-nation Airbus consortium, or the Franco-British venture of GEC-Alsthom,
and where in the absence of harmonisation the risk appreciation of different
EU insurers was very different.
'But exporters often already find it difficult to get a credit at the
national level,' Mr David said, predicting that harmonisation at the EU
level would create further delay with credit offers evaluated by 'people (in
Brussels) who might not be experienced and who might introduce political
arbitrage among the Twelve (member states)'. The US and Japan 'would be
happy to see Europe put itself into another straitjacket', he said.
In July the European Commission proposed 'common principles for guarantees
and premiums in the area of state-supported medium and long term credit
insurance' with greater transparency in the geographic coverage of different
EU credit policies.
At the time, the Commission denied that the plan would impose 'a
straitjacket on the member states and their agencies', saying it would allow
assurers 'considerable leeway to diverge from the principles laid down,
provided they inform the Commission and other member states'.
A senior Commission official said yesterday that the plan, which still has
to win approval by the Council of Ministers, emerged out of guidelines
prepared by a group of national officials from the Twelve.
A former head of Aerospatiale's international division, Mr David complained
that Washington was mounting a 'diplomatico-commercial offensive without
precedent' in support of its aerospace, military and agriculture exports.
He cited a recent seven-year credit on a US wheat sale to Morocco, noting
that credits were supposed to match the lifetime of a product or project,
and President Bill Clinton's overt involvement in last February's Dollars
6bn worth of Boeing aircraft to Saudi Arabia.
This newly aggressive policy meant that the US now accounted for 30 per cent
of the world total of export credit of more than five years maturity,
compared to only 15 per cent three years ago, Mr David said.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Consumer confidence shows fresh dip in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence weakened again this month while new data on employment
costs showed wage inflation still very subdued, helping to offset the
impression created by economic statistics last week that the US economy was
about to accelerate again.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business organisation whose survey of
consumer confidence is widely watched, said its index dropped this month by
two points to 87.6 per cent. This is the fourth monthly drop in succession,
but the board said the index had still fallen by a total of less than 5
points from its peak in June.
Mr Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research
centre, said the survey suggested 'continued economic growth in the months
ahead. Respondents to the survey said they were more worried about job
prospects and less optimistic about their own financial situation than in
previous months.'
Although the decline in the confidence index has been modest, it was much
larger than economic forecasters had anticipated, and served to dampen
concern that the economy might again be showing signs of overheating. That
concern was fuelled last week by strong housing starts data.
Data on sales of existing homes published yesterday showed more weakness,
though sales still rose 1 per cent in September.
The Labour Department said its employment cost index rose by just 0.7 per
cent in the July to September quarter, after rising 0.9 per cent in the
second quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first. This left the annual rate of
increase in employment costs stable at 3.2 per cent, the slowest rate since
the index began in 1982 and arguably the slowest in the last 30 years.
Wages and salaries rose by 0.8 per cent in the third quarter, producing an
annual increase of 2.9 per cent, but benefits, including health insurance,
rose by 1.1 per cent in the quarter for an annual increase of 4.0 per cent.
The Labour Department said wage increases in major collective bargaining
agreements signed in private industry during the July to September period
averaged 1.9 per cent a year.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Sanctions prove a thorny issue in US-Cuba talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Punitive sanctions slapped on Cuba by Washington in August have emerged as a
point of contention in US-Cuban talks which opened in Havana on Monday.
The talks, which end today, are intended to review a 45-day-old bilateral
immigration accord under which the US agreed to increase the number of US
entry visas granted to Cubans each year to a minimum of 20,000. This is to
be done through accelerated visa processing, expanded criteria for refugee
status and a visa lottery to begin November 1.
Mr Dennis Hays, the US delegation leader, said restrictions on flights and
dollar cash remittances to Cuba announced by President Clinton on August 20
were not part of the immigration issue. 'They will not be dealt with at this
time,' he said.
Cuba took the opposite tack arguing that the August package of sanctions
contravened the spirit of the bilateral immigration accord signed on
September 9 in New York.
The US sanctions 'have as much to do with the accord and immigration as the
air that we breathe,' said Mr Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator. 'If
you want normal, orderly immigration, you should not create obstacles to
it,' said Mr Alarcon, president of Cuba's national assembly.
Havana had hoped the immigration accord might lead to a wider dialogue on
ways of solving the US-Cuban conflict.
Mr Clinton introduced the latest sanctions against Cuba in August after
Cuba's President, Mr Fidel Castro, temporarily lifted restrictions on Cubans
fleeing illegally in boats and flimsy rafts to the US.
Some 32,000 refugees, barred access to the US in a sudden change of policy
by Washington, were sent to US bases in Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and
in Panama.

FT  26 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Enemy camp aids Hamlet of the Hudson
 -Cuomo's battle to win a fourth term as New York state's governor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no patented single method of rising to the top of politics in New
York, city and state. Name and money help (FDR, Harriman and Rockefeller
were all governors) as do sheer chutzpah (exemplified by La Guardia and Koch
as mayors) and brains (Senator Daniel Moynihan). But most of the time there
is no substitute for a sheer sense of larger-than-life drama. Not for
nothing is Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor in pursuit of a fourth
term, known as the Hamlet of the Hudson for his musings on the meaning of
life and his own career.
There is now, indisputably, a pretender to that title and a new leading man
on the state stage. The only question is whether Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the
popular Republican mayor of New York City who endorsed the unpopular Mr
Cuomo on Monday afternoon, will come to be seen as a Fortinbras, who
inherited Denmark after Hamlet, or as a scheming Iago with his own agenda.
There are two important sub-plots in Mr Giuliani's decision. The most
obvious centres on the bitter emnity between the mayor and Mr Al D'Amato,
the Republican senator from New York whose hand-picked candidate, the
hitherto obscure Mr George Pataki, is ahead of Mr Cuomo in the governor's
race. In 1989, Mr Guiliani blamed his narrow defeat for mayor by Mr David
Dinkins on the senator's backing of another conservative candidate.
Stemming from that, and advanced both by Mr Giuliani and by a relieved New
York Times editorial yesterday, is the mayor's calculation his perennially
financially strapped city would receive more sympathetic treatment from Mr
Cuomo than it would from a Governor Pataki whose campaign message is to
lower both taxes and spending.
The Giuliani assessment was concisely expressed. He said Mr Cuomo, who has
increased state funding for the city, loved and understood it and did not
make promises he could not fulfil. In contrast Mr Pataki had 'almost
uniformly voted against the interests of the city and often the metropolitan
region.' But most telling, and most aimed at Senator D'Amato and Mr Pataki,
sometimes scathingly labelled Gepetto and Pinocchio, were the words: 'Mario
Cuomo is his own man. I prefer dealing with someone who is his own man, even
if we disagree on some important issues.'
Democratic joy at the Giuliani endorsement knew no bounds. Mr Cuomo
described his decision, naturally, as 'extremely intelligent and
courageous.' President Bill Clinton called the mayor from Cleveland to
express his appreciation. Republican fury, replete with allegations of
treachery, was of a comparable scale. Mr D'Amato declared: 'Rudy Giuliani is
wrong.'
Clearly, much depends on whether or not the Giuliani seal of approval
rescues Mr Cuomo. The New York Post poll yesterday gave Mr Pataki a 44-36
point lead, with 11 per cent undecided and nearly 7 per cent going for Mr
Thomas Golisano, a conservative pro-life independent candidate.
The rough rule of thumb is the governor needs about two-thirds of the city
vote to offset the Pataki advantage in conservative upstate areas. Mr
Giuliani's popularity in his bailiwick should help. One poll found 11 per
cent of the city inclined to follow his recommendation.
The mayor has seemed for some time to be edging towards a Cuomo endorsement,
frequently appearing with him at notionally non-political events. He had met
the Republican candidate only once in the campaign, and reported coolly on
their discussion, yet he was more complimentary after longer sessions with
Mr Golisano, who is competing for the same votes on the right as Mr Pataki.
On the other hand, Mr Cuomo, along with Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachussetts the nation's most prominent liberal Democrat, has appeared
very vulnerable. Not only was the conservative anti-incumbent tide washing
against him, but the length of his tenure and his persistent refusal to take
a national job on the Supreme Court or in the Clinton cabinet left many New
Yorkers with the impression he would have to be winkled out of office.
But the inevitable, though not necessarily accurate, talk of the town
yesterday was as much on the mayor's ambitions beyond his city. With Senator
Moynihan certain of re-election on November 8, the next state-wide openings
are 4 years away in the next governorship race and Mr D'Amato's seat.
It would be easier for the mayor to succeed Mr Cuomo after 16 years than Mr
Pataki after four. A race against Mr D'Amato would whet every appetite for
political blood, but the Senator's control of the state Republican party is
such that challenging him in a primary would be tough. But the trend of the
times favours independent candidates and the mayor has, at a stroke, shown
independence from his own party.
No mayor of New York this century has won higher elective office, though
several have tried. Thus Mr Giuliani's statement on Monday can also be taken
at face value - that he was not thinking about himself but following his own
intuitions and sense of what was best for New York.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Bolivia's way to shed state sector: Local version of
privatisation planned in wake of stabilisation success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In government offices in the centre of La Paz, the lights are burning late.
Fifteen months into the four-year presidency of Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de
Losada, officials are working furiously on the details of a project they
hope will change the shape of the Bolivian economy.
The project aims at transferring to the private sector state enterprises
together responsible for about one-eighth of economic activity.
The process is not being called privatisation. Opinion polls, says Mr Edgar
Saravia, a senior government official, showed that Bolivians associate
privatisation with a loss of national sovereignty and corruption.
The Bolivian version - called capitalisation - aims to skirt these perceived
objections. It proposes bringing in foreign investors to take a strategic
equity stake in the six enterprises, and then a distribution of up to 50 per
cent of the remaining shares to the estimated 3.8m adult Bolivians. These
shares will be placed in special pension accounts to be drawn on an annuity
basis when the holders turn 60.
For a country where only 350,000 people - 5 per cent of the population  -
have bank accounts, this is an ambitious undertaking. But the government
believes it necessary to lift economic growth to levels which will start to
have an impact on poverty. The country is the poorest in the western
hemisphere after Haiti and, according to the World Bank, about 70 per cent
of the population are poor - living on less than a dollar a day.
Bolivia was one of the first countries in Latin America to introduce a
successful economic stabilisation plan to bring down inflation. In 1985,
while planning minister, Mr Sanchez de Losada introduced the programme to
attack annual inflation of over 23,000 per cent. Inflation has come down -
to a forecast 6.8-7.3 per cent this year from 9.1 per cent last. But growth,
while mostly positive - it should reach 4.5 per cent this year - has not
been enough to affect poverty levels.
Unlike most of its regional neighbours, Bolivia failed to follow its
stabilisation plan with privatisations and other reforms of its economic
structure.
This has meant, the government reasons, inadequate investment and therefore
slow growth. Public sector investment at 9 per cent of GDP has been higher
than in most Latin American economies. But according to a World Bank report
completed this month: 'For the most part, these public resources have been
misallocated and invested inefficiently.' Private sector investment has been
running at a weak 5 per cent of GDP.
The aim is to use capitalisation to develop the productive and export
potential, particularly of the energy and mining sectors, and to triple
private sector investment. With public investment falling to around 5 per
cent, the overall investment rate of 20 per cent or more should help to
accelerate growth.
There are difficulties with the capitalisation approach. Unlike in a
privatisation where government revenues are boosted in the initial years,
capitalisation implies short-term costs for the government, because it
receives no revenues. This and other reforms will boost the budget deficit
next year and in 1996.
According to an agreement signed in Washington last week with the
International Monetary Fund, the deficit will widen to 4.4 per cent of GDP
next year, from an estimated 3.3 per cent this year, and in 1996 it will
widen further.
The government hopes that the sales of the stakes to strategic investors
will be completed by July next year. To be capitalised are:
YPFB, the state oil company, which accounts for about 9 per cent of GDP. Its
greatest resources are gas rather than oil, output of which has been falling
slowly since the 1970s. The company's valuation will be boosted
substantially - perhaps by two to three times - if potential investors
perceive that preliminary agreements to export gas to northern Chile and
Brazil will come to fruition soon. It could receive a capital injection of
more than Dollars 1bn, according to some private estimates.
Entel, the long-distance telephone carrier. It connects 260,000 telephone
lines - most run by regionally-based co-operatives. This could, the
government estimates, rise to more than 1m by the year 2003. Revenues have
grown 70 per cent in the past five years to Dollars 101m last year.
ENDE, the state electricity company, and the first to be capitalised. It
generates more than a half of Bolivia's electricity. The country's market is
small - currently there is 760MW of installed capacity - but it is hoped
that the possibility of generating electricity to the country's neighbours
will entice investors.
ENFE, the state railway company. It could be split into three or left as a
single entity. The government may leave it open to allow bidders for one,
two or three entities. The lines are likely to remain formally in state
hands and handed over in 99-year concessions to the operating companies.
LAB, the state-run airline. This is not going to be the easiest
capitalisation: a seminar to orientate potential investors was cancelled
when only three showed interest in turning up.
ENAF, smelters and associated mines. This is essentially what is left of the
Bolivian state mining operations that once dominated the economy. The aim is
to capitalise the smelters and offer leases on associated mines, which
cannot be sold without changing the constitution.
After promising an early start to capitalisation, Mr Sanchez de Losada got
bogged down with other legislation. An overall capitalisation law was
passed, but six more important pieces of legislation are needed for
privatisation, including a law establishing a regulatory system for the
companies, electricity, telecommunications, and hydrocarbons laws, a tax
reform law, and a revised mining code.
Despite trouble this month with his governing coalition, the US-educated
president appears to have secured for himself the necessary majority in both
houses of Congress to pass the legislation. There is a lot riding on
capitalisation, and the president knows it. 'All my bets are placed on it.
I'm a goner if it doesn't work,' he said in an interview last week.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Mexico warning over California
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, has warned that approval by the
state of California of a proposal to curb illegal immigrants' access to
education and healthcare would damage US-Mexican relations.
Mr Manuel Tello urged that proposition 187 - known as save our state - be
rejected when it comes up for vote in the state on November 8. He indicated
Mexico would back a constitutional challenge to the proposition were it
approved by Californian voters.
The proposition, which appears from opinion polls to enjoy the support of a
majority of Californians, would deny education and non-emergency healthcare
to illegal immigrants and their families. It has caused a furore in Mexico,
the main source of illegal immigration to the US. Some border cities have
sought to boycott US goods in protest at the measure.
Mr Tello said the proposition would 'contaminate' bi-lateral relations along
the border. He said trying to deny basic services to the children of
undocumented immigrants would create the figure of a 'big brother that is
watching over you.'
Mexico's ambassador to the US, Mr Jorge Montano, voiced similar concerns.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and
Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton
and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing
their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this
week.
The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will
determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades,
secure peace.
Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400
years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are
taking place.
It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers
Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was
to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack,
for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for
Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority
regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase
of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and
the end of superpower rivalries.
In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the
country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the
country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and
external aggression.
In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within
reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations
secretary-general.
Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the
1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo
dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated
over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of
the regional settlement falls into place.
And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the
critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by
newly democratic South Africa.
Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and
accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market
driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to
develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine
resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of
fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves.
But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go
wrong before the edifice is finally complete.
In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party
and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo
party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat
at the polls.
Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the
optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said
that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'.
The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of
the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique
since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr
Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms,
unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies.
The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but
stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries.
'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no
preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have
opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not
an opposition in ideological terms.'
Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to
the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate
electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls.
Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and
the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola
contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers.
Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have
kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a
coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of
colonialism and 30 years of war.
Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the
people in Luanda.
'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues
can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and
urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by
October 31.
Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991
accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new
hatreds.
The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of
Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups
hunted down and killed Unita supporters.
The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under
the new peace plan, a difficult exercise.
The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to
oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful,
however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale
and provide the manpower required.
Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is
likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside
ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds.
Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from
more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore
oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of
diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main
diamond producing areas.
Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is
unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know
they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for
peace.
Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by
using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part
in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern
Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to
political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent.
Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract
will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for
business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia,
Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment
 -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to
government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether.
For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of
racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological
differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to
harness the power of South Africa.
If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy,
the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as
the start of a new and more prosperous era.
 --------------------------------------------------------
      THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA
 --------------------------------------------------------
1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including
      Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began
      in early 1960s.  Portuguese flee, and civil wars
      break out.  South African troops invade Angola;
      Cuba begins troop build-up.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1976  Mozambique closes border with Rhodesia, where white
      minority had unilaterally declared independence
      from Britain in 1965.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1976  Guerrilla war in Rhodesia escalates as forces led
      by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo infiltrate from
      bases in Mozambique and Zambia.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1979  Lancaster House settlement on Rhodesia paves way
      for the independent state of Zimbabwe; elections
      in 1980 won by Mugabe's Zanu party.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1988  US-brokered deal secures independence for Namibia
      from South Africa in return for Cuban troop
      withdrawal from neighbouring Angola.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1989  Sam Nujoma, leader of South West Africa People's
      Organisation, wins Namibia's independence election.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1990  South Africa releases long-imprisoned black
      nationalist leader Nelson Mandela
 --------------------------------------------------------
1991  Ceasefire in Angola civil war.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1992  Angolan elections confirm President Eduardo dos
      Santos' MPLA in power, but opposition Unita leader
      Jonas Savimbi refuses to accept outcome.  Civil
      war resumes.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1992  Ceasefire in Mozambique civil war.
 --------------------------------------------------------
1994  Mandela's African National Congress wins first
      all-race elections in South Africa.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                         ANGOLA
 --------------------------------------------------------
The 1974 military takeover in Portugal brought Angolan
independence the following year but not peace.  Civil
war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions
and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted
in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating
the opposing Unita movement.  Unita refused to accept
the outcome; war resumed.  Now, peace talks may be
close to success.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                        NAMIBIA
 --------------------------------------------------------
A 1988, US-brokered settlement saw the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African
acceptance of multi-party elections in Namibia.  These
took place in the following year and were won by the
South West Africa People's Organisation, which is still
in power.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                       ZIMBABWE
 --------------------------------------------------------
Once the fiefdom of the British South Africa Company,
the territory (then Rhodesia) became a British colony
at the turn of this century.  The settlers won self
government in 1923, unilaterally declared independence
in 1965, but bowed to sanctions and guerrilla war in 1979.
In 1980 elections, the Zanu party came to power, where
it stays today in partnership with the Zapu party.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                      MOZAMBIQUE
 --------------------------------------------------------
As in Angola, independence in 1975 was traumatic, marked
by the exodus of more than 200,000 settlers of Portuguese
origin and a civil war encouraged first by white
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and then by white South Africa.
A 1992 peace pact brought the war to an end.  This
Thursday and Friday, 6.5m voters go to the polls in the
country's first multi-party elections.
 --------------------------------------------------------
                    SOUTH AFRICA
 --------------------------------------------------------
More than 350 years after Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck
founded a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, white rule
and its apartheid racial policies finally gave way in the
face of sanctions and domestic opposition with the
release from prison in 1990 of Nelson Mandela.  He was
elected president of South Africa this year in the
country's first all-race elections.

telecommunications network from the Israeli state-owned telecom company to
Patelco, comes amid growing international controversy about the award of the
contract. Mr Lawrence Kodacovi, senior vice-president of MCI, said Patelco
would run and operate the telecommunications system in all Palestinian areas
and MCI would provide the network capacity to link the Palestinian areas

FT  26 OCT 94 / Vietnam enters tougher phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam's economic adjustment programme is entering a more demanding phase
now that relatively easy price reforms have been accomplished, the World
Bank said yesterday. Announcing the approval of a Dollars 150m (Pounds
94.9m), 40-year structural adjustment loan, its fourth to Vietnam since
lending resumed last year, the bank said restructuring of state banks,
privatisation of public companies and trade reform had still to be tackled.
Vietnam should also provide a basic civil and commercial law code and
simplify investment rules to facilitate business activity. The reform
programme had produced 'impressive results', but 'some weaknesses are
evident.' Weak infrastructure and an inefficient financial system hindered
investment. International donors could provide finance for development, but
the government would need effective institutions to take most advantage of
development aid. The trade system should be reformed to abolish import
permits and introduce a simplified tariff structure.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Auto electronics market to double: Tougher laws trigger
increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for automotive electronics is forecast to double from Dollars
40bn (Pounds 25.3bn) to Dollars 80bn a year between 1993 and 2000, according
to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The study suggests that the biggest increases will come in the value of
navigation equipment, while the installation of airbags will continue to
rise rapidly. Electronic systems are forecast to account for 30 per cent of
the production cost of a car by 2000.
The value of the electronics content of the average car has already
quadrupled from Dollars 300 in 1980 to Dollars 1,200 in 1990. According to
the report, this is set to increase to Dollars 1,600-Dollars 1,800 per car
in 1995 and to rise further to Dollars 2,200-Dollars 2,500 in 2000.
The EIU study claims that the rise in the use of electronics in cars is
being driven by the introduction of tougher legislation on safety, emission
controls and vehicle security, as well as by technological developments in
the electronics industry and the need by car makers to gain a competitive
advantage.
The value of the car electronics market worldwide is forecast to rise to
Dollars 69bn-Dollars 93bn in 2000 from Dollars 43bn-Dollars 58bn in 1995 and
Dollars 29.7bn in 1990.
Electronic systems for engines, transmissions and chassis will remain the
single most important market sector, with sales forecast to rise from
Dollars 13bn in 1990 to Dollars 23bn in 2000.
The biggest increase will come in driver information systems, however, where
the value of the market is expected to jump from only Dollars 2bn in 1990 to
Dollars 18bn by 2000. Navigation systems will be able to give routes and
update them to take account of changes in traffic.

Sri Lanka's United National party, the main opposition grouping, last night
chose the widow of Mr Gamini Dissanayake to be his successor as its
candidate for next month's presidential election. On Monday, along with 50
others, he was killed by a suicide bomber.
The UNP, which held power for 17 years until its August election defeat, had
been widely expected to pick Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, 45, the former
premier. He led the UNP until the election, but was ousted as its leader by
Mr Dissanayake.
Despite her lack of political experience, Mrs Shrima Dissanayake, a lawyer,
will be a popular choice to run against Mrs Kumaratunga, the ruling People
Alliance's candidate for the presidency. A curfew imposed in Colombo on
Monday was lifted yesterday. The streets were calm. Police fear that the
funerals of the bomb victims could prompt demonstrations.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Sri Lanka fears passions will erupt: Peace hopes are in
doubt during run-up to poll for president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colombo, where Mr Gamini Dissanayake, Sri Lanka's opposition leader, and 50
other people were killed by a suicide bomber on Monday, returned to normal
with almost unseemly haste yesterday.
The curfew imposed immediately after the blast was lifted and banks, shops
and offices were open. It appeared that after living through two political
assassinations last year, Sri Lankans have grown used to the murder of their
leaders.
Yet deep concern exists on the island about the lasting effects of Mr
Dissanayake's death. The fear is that the passions aroused by the murder of
such a popular leader will sooner or later come into the open. They might
erupt into street violence as early as the funerals which begin today and
end with Mr Dissanayake's state funeral on Saturday.
Or they could linger and affect politics and society in more subtle but
equally disruptive ways. 'People may not show it, but they are very
distressed,' Mr Neelan Tiruchelvam, a Colombo lawyer, says.
The public distress is acute because it has come at a time of unprecedented
hope about Sri Lanka's future, engendered by the efforts of Mrs Chandrika
Kumaratuna, the newly elected prime minister, to end the island's civil war.
Mrs Kumaratunga, who took power in August after 17 years' rule by Mr
Dissanayake's United National party, started talks with the Tamil 'Tigers',
fighting for an independent Tamil homeland. As Mr Tiruchelvam, a Tamil,
says: 'In Sri Lanka we swing quickly from optimism to despair. Now we are in
despair'.
The key question is the impact of the assassinations on the peace effort.
Even though the police have little evidence linking the attack to the
'Tigers', the general assumption in Colombo is that they carried it out.
The 'Tigers' have denied responsibility for the assassinations, but their
denials carry little weight in Colombo. The security forces believe that
only the 'Tigers' command the fierce loyalty and access to high-quality
explosives needed to organise a suicide bombing.
The 'Tigers' have been linked to two deadly suicide attacks, on Mr Rajiv
Gandhi, the then Indian prime minister, in 1991, and Mr Ranasinghe
Premadasa, the Sri Lankan president killed last year.
In the weeks since her election victory, Mrs Kumaratunga had built
broad-based support among the majority Sinhalese in favour of peace talks,
but it seems certain this week's assassinations will undermine this
consensus, though it is difficult to say by how much.
'The conditions for the peace talks were favourable. Now there will be great
suspicion about the guerrillas' good faith. This is one of the worst
consequences of the act,' a Colombo-based diplomat says.
Mrs Kumaratunga has prudently postponed talks between government and Tamil
representatives which started two weeks ago and were in progress near
Jaffna, the Tamil stronghold in the north. She will now face calls for a
long delay and for outright cancellation. Army officers, who claimed the
government had made too many concessions, will now find it easier to
criticise her.
A crucial test of public opinion will come in the presidential election due
to be held on November 9 in which Mr Dissanayake was challenging Mrs
Kumaratunga. Mrs Kumaratunga had been expected to win, despite a strong
campaign by Mr Dissanayake. His death should generate some sympathy votes
for his party and votes from those wanting to protest at talks with the
rebels.
But the UNP could lose the support of Mr S. Thondaman, the powerful and
politically volatile leader of the tea estate workers' union, wooed away
from Mrs Kumaratunga by Mr Dissanayake but who could now swing his support
back to the premier.
On balance, Mrs Kumaratunga is still expected to win because the UNP lacks
another candidate of Mr Dissanayake's stature. An unemphatic victory could
stall the talks. Mr Desmond Fernando, a lawyer, says: 'I fear there could be
a swing against compromise'.
Sri Lanka has learned to live with political violence, especially in the
past 18 months, which have seen three assassination attacks. Neither the
death of President Premadasa, nor of Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, an opposition
leader, provoked civil unrest or much social or economic disruption. Western
tourists, sensitive to political violence, have continued to come to Sri
Lanka.
This time too, expectations are that little damage will be done to the
economy. The Colombo Stock Exchange's all-share index fell by 31.74 points,
2.85 per cent, yesterday to 1,081.27, but stockbrokers said this was a
reflex reaction. The economy remains strong and likely to meet the
government's target of 6 per cent growth in gross domestic product this
year, after a 6.9 per cent increase in 1993.
Mr Kishan Vairawanathan, a manager at the Colombo office of Crosby
Securities, the Hong Kong investment broker, says: 'A feeling of optimism
has been shattered. That accounts for the fall. But I think the market will
now stabilise'. But much will depend on the run-up to the presidential
election and its outcome. If Mrs Kumaratunga fares badly, the hopes of peace
vested in her may fade too.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Chinese gear up for huge rise in cars by 2010
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

China's cars are projected to rise in numbers to 22m by the year 2010, with
individual ownership increasing sharply to 60 per cent of all vehicles on
the country's roads, against less than 5 per cent at present, an
authoritative study says.
This predicted increase of car ownership and production in China will
clearly have enormous implications for the automotive sector
internationally.
The study, by a group within the Chinese bureaucracy called the Strategic
Development Research Team of China's Family Car, forecast that by 2010 China
will build 3.5m cars a year, with two-thirds of them being sold to private
motorists. Total production value of the automotive sector will reach
Yn420bn (Pounds 31.6bn) a year, with an extra Yn1,052bn being generated by
associated industries.
The study estimated the automotive sector would be generating Yn80bn
annually in tax revenue by 2010 and would have created 15m new jobs. 'Having
a family car will signal that a Chinese citizen's life has turned from a
moderately well-to-do to a rich one,' the study reported.
Publication this week in the Economic Daily of the study coincides with a
debate within the Chinese bureaucracy about the desirability of increased
private car ownership. Mr He Guangyuan, minister of machinery industry
warned this week against the danger of 'old attitudes' to car ownership
hindering development. 'If we can't see how necessary it is for
car-ownership to become widespread and don't actively support a private car
market, it would be hard for car-making to become a pillar industry,' he
told the China Business Times newspaper.
Rapid development of the automotive sector is meeting opposition from
bureaucrats who see car ownership as bourgeois. Sections of government fear
China's infrastructure would be unable to cope with so many cars on an
over-taxed road system.
China recently unveiled a new car industry policy that envisages the
establishment of three or four car manufacturing conglomerates by 2000,
engaged in the mass production of family sedans. The policy instituted a
freeze on new manufacturers entering China until 1996 to enable present
operators to build up strength.
Volkswagen, in partnership with the Shanghai Automotive Industry
Corporation, is China's biggest maker of passenger cars. In 1993 it built
100,000 Santanas, a medium-sized family car, out of a total of 234,000
sedans made throughout China, which plans to be producing 1.35m passenger
cars a year by 2000, with 90 per cent of the market supplied from local
production. Output would rise to 3.5m-4m units by the year 2010.
From 1979 to 1993 the number of cars in China grew from 150,000 to 1.4m, of
which 50,000 are privately owned. Cars owned by individuals or families will
amount to about 20 per cent of total cars on the road in China in 2000.
Percentages of individual car ownership would rise to 40 per cent in 2005
and 60 per cent in 2010.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Japan index recovers to 7-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's official index of current business conditions hit a seven-year high
in August, suggesting the recovery may be becoming more broadly based.
The government Economic Planning Agency's coincident indicator, a basket of
11 economic and business measures, rose above the 50 per cent dividing line
between growth and decline in August for the first time in three months. It
hit 90 per cent, the highest since July 1987.
This eases pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, when the yen
is strengthening again, and reduces strain on the government in the middle
of a difficult parliamentary session.
The EPA's leading indicator, a measure of the three-to-six-month outlook,
was even stronger, at 100 per cent, the eighth month at which it has stood
above economic equilibrium. Within this, 10 of the leading index's 13
components were pointing upwards. This suggests the current upturn has more
depth than the economic revival of spring 1993, which turned out to be a
false start, Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel Pacific, said.
Four components of the leading index shifted from decline to growth between
July and August: graduates' job prospects, the amount of floorspace used by
companies, money supply, and manufacturing industry profitability. Most of
the other components continued a regular improvement.
Evidence that patches of weakness still exist in important parts of the
Japanese economy emerged yesterday with poor results from the vehicle and
department stores sectors.
Vehicle production fell 7.2 per cent to 5.1m units in the six months to
September, from the same period last year - the third-sharpest six-monthly
fall in 20 years, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
Department stores, a victim of discount retailing, recorded a 2.1 per cent
sales decline in the year to September, the 31st monthly decline running.
But it was an improvement on the 3.6 per cent decline shown in August.
Stores' business continues to crawl, the Japan Department Stores Association
said.
The cabinet yesterday adopted a plan to spend Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) to
prepare rice farmers for the gradual opening of their market.
The package, prepared by the three parties of the ruling coalition, clears
the way for parliament to ratify the trade liberalisation bills needed to
comply with the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Market in auto electronics set to double
</HEADLINE>

The market for automotive electronics is forecast to double from Dollars
40bn (Pounds 25.3bn) to Dollars 80bn a year between 1993 and 2000, according
to a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The study suggests that the biggest increases will come in the value of
navigation equipment, while the installation of airbags will continue to

the production cost of a car by 2000.
The value of the electronics content of the average car has already

The biggest increase will come in driver information systems, however, where
the value of the market is expected to jump from only Dollars 2bn in 1990 to
Dollars 18bn by 2000. Navigation systems will be able to give routes and
update them to take account of changes in traffic.
Car radio/cassette players will play an important role in receiving and
storing traffic information as well as details of hotels, restaurants and
service stations in an area.
Several companies are already developing components which will increase
safety in poor light and in dense traffic, including radar, fog sensors,
infra-red cameras, navigation systems and intelligent cruise control.
The development of inexpensive radar, which is seen as critical to the
development of intelligent cruise control, is claimed to be better than
infra-red technology for use in collision avoidance sensors. Smart cards are
expected to replace ignition/door keys, as they will be able to be used as
driving licences, to actuate roadside emergency telephones, and to allow the
driver to adjust seat and mirror positions.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Jordan 'needs help to ease burden of debt'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jordan needs relief from its heavy foreign debt burden if it is to reach the
kind of growth rates necessary to bring a real peace dividend to its
population, the World Bank has warned in a new study of the impact of peace
on the Jordanian economy.
Jordan's economic reform programme could bring growth of up to 4 per cent a
year, but the World Bank calculates the country needs to achieve a higher
growth rate.
'To really make a difference to high unemployment rates, to really cement
the peace, Jordan needs around 6 per cent growth per year,' says Mr Caio
Koch-Weser, the World Bank's vice-president in charge of the Middle East and
North Africa.
That would require private investment rates of about 20 per cent of gross
domestic product, the report says, a rate which will be impossible to
achieve so long as Jordan is struggling under the burden of more than
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) of foreign debt, roughly 1.5 times its GDP.
'For the man in the street, the question is what has peace done for me, and
that is where you see the urgency of doing something about the debt to make
the leap from 4 to 6 per cent growth,' Mr John Page, the World Bank's chief
economist for the region, says.
To reduce Jordan's debt burden to about 75 per cent of GDP by 1998, the
World Bank calculates that about Dollars 1.7bn of debt reduction would be
needed. Full debt forgiveness of about Dollars 3.3bn in 1994 would greatly
improve Jordan's macroeconomic outlook and 'significantly enhance the
prospects of strong popular support for the peace process,' the report says.
The report warns that the economic impact of peace will probably be felt
more slowly than many hope. Among the most important longer-term gains will
be improved co-operation on water issues. Mr Koch-Weser warns that without
action, all the countries of the region face water shortages in the next
15-20 years, but Jordan's water crisis is perhaps the most imminent.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Saudi payment delays upset export cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The availability of short-term export credit insurance for British companies
doing business in Saudi Arabia has been sharply reduced because of the
kingdom's 'very grave' financial situation and lengthening payments delays.
NCM Credit Insurance, the Dutch-controlled company which accounts for 80 per
cent of short-term export credit cover in the UK, has told customers it is
cancelling open account credit limit approvals and will only reinstate them
if strict criteria are met. This means that cover to regular exporters will
no longer be automatically available.
The company added: 'We recognise the seriousness of these measures and their
likely impact on the business of many of our customers. However, the
situation in Saudi is very grave and continues to deteriorate. It is
therefore vital that we take action to protect not only our own position
but, in the final analysis, that of our customers'.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said yesterday that Saudi
Arabia was facing some 'credit problems', but added that the kingdom did not
have any serious financial difficulties. Mr Bentsen, who visited Saudi
Arabia earlier this month, added that the government was taking steps to
bring down the budget deficit.
International concern about Saudi Arabia's financial health has increased
since the 1991 Gulf War, which cost the kingdom some Dollars 60bn (Pounds
40bn), and because of the continuing weakness in the price of oil. In an
effort to answer International Monetary Fund concerns over the size of the
budget deficit, the Saudi government announced at the start of the year that
it would cut spending by 20 per cent. In part this is being achieved by
delaying payments to customers.
A western diplomat in Riyadh conceded yesterday that many Saudi businessmen
were pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook, but stressed that
Saudi Arabia's ability to pump 8m barrels of oil a day for the next century
guaranteed its long-term economic viability.
NCM warned more than two months ago of its concern over lengthening payments
delays and said amounts outstanding were 'significant'. It added that the
payments delays by the Saudi government were affecting all areas of the
economy, particularly construction and agriculture, and were having an
impact on the ability of Saudi buyers to meet their commitments to overseas
suppliers.
Since then, according to NCM, 'the position has steadily deteriorated and
the impact on the market has become ever more apparent'. In a report to
customers, NCM added: 'Repeated promises of payment from senior Saudi
officials, including promises made directly to UK trade ministers, have not
been fulfilled and there is no suggestion of an early improvement in the
situation'.
NCM, which recently sent a team to Saudi Arabia to study the situation, also
claims that Saudi companies which had borrowed in order to sustain their
cash flow and payments performance, had now reached the limit of their
borrowing capacity. This, in turn, would 'seriously undermine the
reliability of current payment performance as an indicator of a continuing
ability to pay'.

<TEXT>
China's spending on infrastructure would be about Dollars 500bn (Pounds
316bn) over the next decade, Mr Liu Zhongli, the country's finance minister,
told an Asian Development Bank-sponsored conference in Beijing, writes Tony
Walker. Mr Liu said that to meet China's huge requirements more funds would
be raised internationally, either through bond issues or from loans provided
by international financial institutions and foreign governments.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Balladur-Chirac duel descends into farce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Such is now the intensity of political rivalry inside France's ruling
Gaullist RPR party that every move by the prime minister, Mr Edouard
Balladur, or by Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader, is automatically
interpreted as part of their deadly duel to win the Elysee.
The fact that Mr Balladur cancelled a meeting yesterday with RPR deputies
was widely interpreted as a move to dodge confrontation with backbench MPs
complaining at his criticism of Mr Chirac.
Mr Balladur himself explained that he had found time to meet RPR senators
yesterday, but not the deputies, because, though he was pressed for time, he
had a long-standing appointment to meet the former group.
But his side-stepping of the deputies may have also had something to do with
the fact the latter included Mr Chirac, an MP for the Correze region as well
as mayor of Paris, and who had decided to delay a trip to Tokyo for several
hours to attend the meeting. This prompted speculation about whether it was
Mr Balladur who cancelled, on learning Mr Chirac had altered his travel
plans, or vice versa.
All that this farce can be safely held to illustrate is the extraordinary
allergy that has developed between France's prime minister and the leader of
his own party.
Despite all the calls by themselves and their party for unity, the two men
seem to like being as far apart as possible. These days, for instance, Mr
Chirac likes to be out of Paris on Tuesdays when Mr Balladur hosts a weekly
meeting of the conservative coalition's leaders.
One possible way of settling the Balladur-Chirac rivalry would be to hold
US-style primary elections, as urged by Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior
minister. But acceptance of this proposal is unlikely.
The former French president, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said yesterday
that rivalries on the right were no obstacle to winning the presidency. He
noted that the right had three times fielded two rival candidates since 1958
and won.
Meanwhile, Mr Alain Carignon, who resigned from the Balladur government to
fight corruption allegations, was yesterday remanded in custody at least
until October 28, while at the same time a former close associate of his at
the Grenoble city hall made fresh accusations in yesterday's Liberation
newspaper that Mr Carignon had promised the city's water concession to
Lyonnaise des Eaux.

The Council of Europe said yesterday that Russia's human rights record was
still not good enough to allow it to join. 'Russia has made considerable
progress for satisfying the Council of Europe's standards. But the country
still has a long way to go,' said Mr David Atkinson, chairman of the
committee which decides membership questions. Russia applied to join the
32-nation pan-European body, which promotes democracy and human rights, in
1992. But its application was dealt a blow earlier this month when a panel
of European experts delivered a damning indictment of its legal system and
its protection of human and minority rights.

Turkey could 'whip Greece' if the two Nato allies fight over rights in the
Aegean Sea, the Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, said on Turkish
television on Monday night. 'We don't want a reckoning. We know who will win
if there is one. We can whip Greece,' Mr Soysal said. He added that Turkey
was making military preparations but did not elaborate. 'If you want peace
you must be prepared for war,' he said quoting a Turkish saying. Greece
maintains it has a right to double its territorial waters to 12 nautical
miles but has no plans to do so. Turkey has said Greece's enforcement of a
12-mile limit would be reason for war. Many Greek islands are close to the
Turkish mainland and extension of Greek waters would effectively deny
Turkish boats access to the sea. The two countries backed down from the
brink of war over mineral rights in the Aegean Sea in 1987.
US assistant secretary of state John Shattuck yesterday voiced his 'greatly
heightened concern about the growing cycle of violence' in Turkey. During a
visit, he condemned the 'terror' of the Kurdish insurgency in the south-east
of the country but called on Turkey to seek a political, rather than
military, solution to the conflict.

Hungary's new Socialist-led administration yesterday sacked most of the
directors of two large state companies and is expected to announce similar
changes at its oil and electricity monopolies shortly. Mr Laszlo Pal, trade
and industry minister, said the head of MVM, the electricity monopoly, had
used company revenues to support the previous conservative government's
electoral campaign and that several MVM board members were not qualified for
their jobs. He said eight of the 11 board members would be removed next
week. AV Rt, the state holding company, said it had dismissed the general
director of Antenna Rt, the radio and television transmission operator, from
its board for failing to notify it and co-directors of a Ft1bn (Pounds 5.8m)
contract. It said it had dismissed five of the nine directors of TVK, the
country's largest chemical company, in order to facilitate privatisation.
Western observers in Budapest welcomed some of the changes, which had been
expected for some time, and said that overall the new appointees were well
qualified.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, chief rival to Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign
minister and head of the Free Democrats (FDP), yesterday resigned from his
party post in protest against being excluded from coalition talks with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Mollemann, who went so far as to blame Mr Kinkel
for the FDP's poor showing in the recent federal elections, quit as party
leader in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. The FDP saw its share of the
vote reduced from 11 per cent in 1990 to 6.9 per cent two weeks ago.
Officials in Bonn said Mr Mollemann's resignation was unlikely to heal the
policy rifts in the FDP. The party is sharply divided between those who want
a return to libertarian values and greater deregulation of the market, and
those who have compromised the party's old traditions in favour of remaining
as a junior partner in Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic-led coalition. The
future strategy of the party will be debated at a special meeting in
December. Mr Mollemann, a former economics minister who was forced to resign
his cabinet post in late 1992 for abuse of office, would not discuss his
future plans.

The European Commission yesterday challenged member states to speed up the
liberalisation of Europe's telecommunications industry. The Commission
decided to adopt the first part of its green paper on infrastructures, which
is aimed at opening those that are currently only authorised to carry
specific services - for example rail and energy networks - to other
liberalised services. This would cover video-on-demand and distance
learning, for example, but not basic voice telephone services, which will
not be liberalised until 1998. Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible
for competition, said the Commission had also backed in principle the aim of
liberalising basic telephone infrastructures - which remain largely under
monopoly control - by January 1 1998, at the same time that voice services
are opened up to competition. The Commission also intends to present member
states with proposals, at a meeting of telecoms ministers next month, for
liberalising cable television networks. The Commission's decision yesterday
should allow the council of ministers to establish a clear timetable for
liberalisation before the Essen summit in December.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Austrian industrial output rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Zurich
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Austria's industrial output rose 4 per cent year-on-year in August following
a 5 per cent rise in July. The figures confirm the strength of the economic
recovery following the country's short and shallow recession last year.
Economists have recently raised their forecasts of real GDP growth this year
to nearly 3 per cent after a 0.5 per cent fall last year. Industrial
production is being supported by buoyant exports, a housing construction
boom and undented consumer confidence. Inflation remains a concern, but the
annual rate eased to 3.1 per cent in September from 3.2 per cent in August.
Economists hope that pressure on consumer prices will grow when the country
joins the European Union at the beginning of next year. The other worry, the
public sector deficit, is more likely to be aggravated by EU entry as well
as by the less stable political situation following national elections
earlier this month.
Wholesale prices in Denmark rose by 0.1 per cent from August to September,
and were 1.7 per cent higher than in the same month last year. This supports
government claims that despite a predicted GDP growth rate of 4.6 per cent
this year there are no signs that inflationary pressures are increasing.
Swedish producer prices rose 0.4 per cent in September from August, when
they rose 0.8 per cent. Year-on-year, producer prices rose 5.5 per cent.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Anglo-French ties to grow despite 'teasing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and France are edging towards closer co-operation, particularly in
defence and security, despite the two countries' history of ill-tempered
spats and sharply contrasting rhetoric over the future of Europe.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, told an Anglo-French audience in
London this week that 'there are really no two substantial countries more
similar than France and Britain'. 'We differ occasionally, though almost
always only by a degree or two, in our response to particular world events,'
he added. 'But when it comes to the point . . . we are side by side.'
While acknowledging the existence of 'mutual teasing and aggravation'
between the British and French media, he stressed the two nations' virtual
identity of views over Bosnia and argued that their ideas on the European
Union were not far apart. 'Neither for Britain nor for France is there
attraction in a vision of Europe which erodes national identity,' the
foreign secretary told the Franco-British council.
He stressed that for now, Britain and France were the only two European
countries which had extensive global interests, and therefore maintained a
defence capability that was well adapted to overseas deployment.
Germany, prevented until recently by political and constitutional barriers
from sending troops into combat overseas, is preparing at least one division
for global deployment. However, this is not expected to be ready until the
year 2000. Mr Hurd confirmed that the UK and France were engaged in
discussions about closer co-operation in military aviation, which were
expected to come to a head at the Anglo-French summit in Chartres next
month.
British officials say these discussions are focusing on relatively technical
questions, such as common procedures for sharing air space, which would make
it easier for the UK and French air forces to co-operate in humanitarian or
peace-keeping missions overseas. French press reports have suggested that a
joint headquarters, or even a joint intervention force, could be
established. But one British official insisted that at this stage, such
speculation amounted to 'adding two and two and making eight'.
Setting aside the intense Anglo-French wrangling which has often marred
discussions about European security, Mr Hurd said both countries were
committed to closer integration of the continent's defence effort. 'The
contribution of both Britain and France will be indispensable,' he said.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Italian budget faces big hurdles: MPs' amendments may hit
revenue measures and pension reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is struggling to retain the identity and objectives
of the 1995 budget amidst a vast quantity of amendments being tabled by the
right-wing coalition and the opposition alike.
The latest and most important amendment has been introduced by the
government to offset a poor response to one of the main revenue raising
measures. The move concerns a loosening of the rules regarding the amnesty
on illegal construction and property development to encourage more taxpayers
to take advantage of the concession. The amnesty, based on encouraging
persons to register construction carried out without proper permission
through the payment of a small fine, has failed to prove attractive. The
measure was introduced before the summer and is due to yield L2,500bn
(Pounds 1bn) this year and close to L10,000bn next year.
But so far only L61bn has been paid in and the initial closing date for
registrations is October 31. Thus, the government is further reducing the
scope of sanctions applied to illicit buildings, especially on first homes.
The opposition has already challenged the original measure and a number of
regional administrations have challenged the decree on environmental grounds
in the constitutional court, adding further to the confusion over the likely
revenue yield.
More than 1,000 amendments have been tabled to the budget - in almost equal
proportion between the government members and the opposition. The bulk of
the changes relate to the controversial pensions reform, following the
government's decision to try to eliminate the many anomalies and hardship
cases created by the proposals submitted on September 30.
According to latest estimates, the changes will add an extra L1,000bn to the
pensions bill in 1995 and even more in the following two years. The treasury
is adamant the budget deficit target of L138,000bn, equivalent to 8 per cent
of GDP, cannot be altered. However, the more the original measures are
altered to satisfy different interest groups, the harder it will be to
maintain this target.
Yesterday the trade unions announced they were going ahead with plans to
organise a 1m strong demonstration in Rome on November 12 to protest against
the budget and pension reform. This is a follow-up to the general strike two
weeks ago.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Brussels warns of future steel industry crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's steel industry risks another crisis in the future because of its
failure to deliver crucial capacity cuts, warned Mr Karel Van Miert,
European commissioner responsible for competition. He was announcing the
death of the Commission's steel restructuring plan, created two years ago to
help restore the beleaguered industry to health during Europe's deep
recession.
Mr Van Miert said industry's failure to stick to the plan had left it with
overcapacity in the EU of some 20m tonnes. 'It is unfortunate that in this
plan not all the actors did what needed to be done,' he said.
Under the plan, Europe's steelmakers were required to make minimum cuts in
capacity of 19m tonnes, but fell short of this target by around 3.5m tonnes.
Enthusiasm for the capacity cuts wore off as international steel prices
began to recover steadily.
Disbandment of the plan means that there will be no more discussion between
the commission and industry over the state of the market, with the
Commission dropping its quarterly guidelines for production and delivery
volumes. In addition, measures to restrict imports from eastern Europe - in
particular from Slovakia and the Czech Republic - will be dropped. 'Normal
competitive conditions will apply,' said Mr Van Miert.
The German Steel Federation criticised the decision, saying that its members
had done their part to cut capacity, 'trusting that the European Commission
would continue its efforts for market stabilisation until a successful
conclusion'. Since 1992 German companies had made decisions to cut 6m tonnes
of crude steel and almost 3m tonnes of hot-rolled products, it said.
Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann has said the EU industry was wrong to
put off needed restructuring because of a temporary recovery in the market.
'They'll be knocking (on the door) again in three years time,' said a
Commission official.
The recovery is in part due to increased exports to the US and Asia, said Mr
Alan Coats, a steel analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. He said
the industry cannot depend on exports for continued health, especially since
imports from eastern Europe and Russia were likely to grow.
Despite the collapse of the rescue plan, a package of social subsidies,
designed to ease the impact of steel plant closures, will continue to apply
until the end of 1995, the Commission said yesterday.
The Commission has also decided to recommend to member states that they
accept the German government's bid to rescue Eko Stahl, east Germany's
largest steel mill, through a hefty state subsidy.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Bosnia politicians call for removal of Rose: Relations
between UN force chief and government at new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Diplomatic Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between Bosnia's Moslem-led government and the United Nations
plunged to a new low yesterday as Sarajevo politicians demanded the removal
of General Sir Michael Rose, UN force commander.
Bosnian officials and the UN also exchanged harsh words over the origin of
an unprecedented fire-fight between government soldiers and French
peacekeepers on the slopes of Mount Igman outside Sarajevo.
Eight Bosnian political parties supported a demand that 'Rose must go'
published in Sarajevo's daily newspaper, Oslobodenje.
They accused the British commander, whose year-long tour of duty ends in
January, of having 'done everything to water down the decisiveness of the
free world in punishing crime and fascism'. He was more interested in
protecting British interests than implementing UN resolutions, they claimed.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, sprang to Gen Rose's
defence, expressing 'full confidence' in him and voicing 'gratitude' for his
'wonderful work'.
UN spokesman Colonel Tim Spicer said Gen Rose was not concerned about the
Bosnian criticism and there was no question of his leaving before his
assignment ended. 'The job of a peacekeeper as opposed to a peace enforcer
is a difficult path to walk and there is no question that Gen Rose has
walked a central line in furtherance of the mission given to him.'
The general's reputation among Sarajevo residents soared last February when
his tough diplomacy helped end the siege of the city and restore relative
normality to daily life. His standing sagged two months later when Moslems
thought him too soft in responding to the Serb assault on the Gorazde
enclave, and it fell further in August, when the UN failed to stop the Serbs
from reimposing a partial blockade of Sarajevo.
UN officials stress, however, that from the start his efforts to ensure a
normal life for as many Bosnian civilians as possible have met with far from
universal co-operation from Bosnian officials and generals. The February
ceasefire in Sarajevo required some very tough talking to Bosnia's Moslem
leaders as well as to the besieging Serbs.
Two bursts of machine-gun fire raked a Sarajevo tram yesterday, wounding
nine people, one of them seriously, Bosnian police and hospital officials
told Reuter. 'It was the sower of death,' said a Bosnian policeman,
referring to a heavy machine-gun with a distinctive sound much feared by
residents because it is often loaded with exploding bullets. 'This was the
worst single incident our hospital has handled since February,' a doctor
said.

to Frankfurt as the site for Europe's future central bank, according to a
confidential Dutch government memorandum.
The memorandum is the first evidence that Chancellor Helmut Kohl linked the
location of the future central bank to who should succeed Mr Jacques Delors.
It also explains Mr Kohl's resolute opposition to Mr Lubbers, recently
retired as the longest serving prime minister in Dutch history.
But the document confirms, too, how Mr Kohl saw the location of the European
Monetary Institute in Frankfurt as the absolute minimum needed to assuage
the German public's fears about giving up the D-Mark in a future European
monetary union. This is despite European allies' worries about strengthening
Frankfurt as a financial centre in charge of a de facto D-Mark zone.
In an interview yesterday, Mr Piet Dankert, the former Dutch minister for
European affairs and current member of the European parliament, confirmed
the authenticity of the memo, first disclosed at the weekend by the Dutch
KRO public television service.
Mr Dankert singled out a high-level diplomatic exchange in Bonn on October
21, 1993, in which Mr Joachim Bitterlich, the Chancellor's top foreign
affairs adviser, attacked Mr Lubbers' opposition to Frankfurt as the
appropriate location for the EMI.
Mr Bitterlich warned Mr Dankert that this opposition would have
'consequences', with Mr Kohl turning to another candidate for the top
Commission post.
Mr Kohl's private office yesterday denied any connection between the
location of the EMI and the Delors succession, or that Mr Bitterlich had
raised the matter during Mr Dankert's visit to Bonn.
However, Mr Dankert said he recalled receiving a veiled warning about the
EMI connection from Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, a senior German official, which
was then delivered more forcibly by Mr Bitterlich.
Mr Dankert said: 'There is not the slightest doubt that the conversation
took place. Because of its explosive nature, I asked for an immediate note
to be taken down.'
He relayed the German threat to Mr Lubbers at a meeting early the following
morning. Mr Lubbers then sought a meeting with Mr Bitterlich two days later
in which a second veiled threat was made, according to the KRO broadcast.
Senior German officials familiar with the meeting argued that it made no
sense for the Bonn government to issue a direct threat to Mr Lubbers
because, at that time, he had failed to announce his candidature to succeed
Mr Delors.
But the officials conceded that the strongest representations had been made
to the Dutch government to drop their campaign to locate the EMI in
Amsterdam or, as a second best choice, Bonn. The officials said the matter
turned on German's sovereign right to choose where it wished to place the
future central bank.
European Union leaders finally agreed to Frankfurt at a summit in Brussels
on October 29, 1993. Mr Kohl subsequently asked Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the
Belgian prime minister, to become a candidate to succeed Mr Delors. France
later backed the Dehaene candidacy, despite President Francois Mitterrand's
preference for Mr Lubbers.
However, the UK, with tacit Dutch support, objected to the Franco-German
plan and vetoed Mr Dehaene at the European summit in Corfu last June. Mr
Kohl called a second summit in mid-July in which he secured a consensus in
favour of Mr Jacques Santer, prime minister of Luxembourg.
Many MEPs objected to Mr Santer and raised questions about the procedure for
selecting the president of the Commission, a post which Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, described as one of the most important in the
world.

FT  26 OCT 94 / US hails Moscow reform effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The rouble's recent fall has served as a 'wake-up' call for the Russian
government, creating an important opportunity for a serious stabilisation
programme next year, Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs, said in Moscow yesterday.
After talks with Russian officials about the reform process and 1995 budget
proposals, Mr Summers said he would take an encouraging report back to
Washington.
'It is clear that Russian economic reform is at an important crossroads and
it is clear that the government is charting a course forward,' he said. 'I
welcome the clear intentions from all the government officials I met with of
a commitment to serious stabilisation.'
He warned, however, that the erosion of the tax collection system and the
growth of organised crime posed serious threats.
Mr Summers said tax revenues were 4 per cent of gross national product less
than they were a year ago. 'Reversal of that kind of erosion will be central
to the stabilisation effort,' he said, suggesting what was needed was to
collect more tax money at lower rates from a broader base.
The austere budget proposals for 1995 envisage that further monetary
tightening will reduce inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of the
year. The federal budget deficit would also be kept within 8.3 per cent of
gross domestic product.
One Group of Seven official said: 'What is under discussion is the prospect
of a real stabilisation not just a slowing down of inflation. That means
more reform and potentially more direct financial support than has come from
the IMF so far.'
But some western economists warn that the government has talked tough before
and bowed to the pressures of the industrial lobby to issue more credits.
The 1995 budget is also expected to have a rough passage through parliament
and the ability to implement the current proposals is far from certain.
Mr Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said yesterday that
the government also had to change the 'oil export structure' and revise the
taxation system to achieve financial stabilisation.
Mr Summers said the recent currency volatility had been a stark warning of
the dangers of loosening the economic levers.
'I do not think that there is any question that their monetary and credit
policies in late summer were an important contributing factor in the fall of
the rouble,' Mr Summers said.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Report hails 'lively' Germany recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government was quick to claim yesterday that its policies had
been vindicated by a report from the country's six leading economic
institutes predicting that the economy would grow by 2.5 per cent this year
and by a further 3 per cent next year.
Presenting their twice yearly study, the most comprehensive check-up on the
health of the German economy, the institutes said the recovery had been
'surprisingly early and lively'. In April they had predicted that German
gross domestic product would rise by 1.5 per cent.
'Now we can see that the government's economic assumptions were not just
calculated optimism but based on the improved conditions for growth which
have been achieved,' Finance Minister Theo Waigel said.
For the third time running, however, the left wing Berlin-based German
Institute for Economic Research (DIW) disagreed with the other five
institutes, arguing that the rise in long-term interest rates posed a threat
to economic recovery. The institute said GDP would grow by 1.5 per cent next
year.
The report says Germany's recovery had initially been driven by exports but
there was now evidence that capital investment had become the driving force
of the recovery. Responding to the report, however, the influential
Federation of German Industry (BDI) said there were fewer grounds for
optimism because companies were still not earning enough to make substantial
investments.
Inflation, which has failed to fall below 3 per cent in August and
September, is forecast to dip to 2.5 per cent next year, the report said.
Continuing inflationary pressure caused by the growth of the M3 money
supply, the key indicator used by the Bundesbank, suggested there was no
need for the central bank to make any substantial cuts in its leading
interest rates, the report said.
The institutes also recommended the government increase the budget deficit
in order to relieve companies and consumers of 'massive tax increases'. But
the association which represents Germany's largest private banks, said it
would be wrong to raise the budget deficit in order simply to cut
expenditure. 'A strict reduction of spending and the reduction of the amount
of taxes levied should go hand in hand,' the Federation of German Banks
said.
The report coincides with figures which show that Germany's trade surplus
rose sharply in August to DM7.1bn (Pounds 2.9bn), double the July level.
Exports were 14 per cent up on the previous year while imports rose 6 per
cent.
The trade surplus for the first eight months of this year totalled DM47bn,
25 per cent higher than for the same period a year earlier. The current
account deficit, however, almost doubled to DM36.5bn, partly because of the
high level of payments by German tourists abroad.
Meanwhile the public sector financing deficit confirmed the positive trends,
falling by DM23bn to DM63bn for the first half of this year, better than the
1994 budget plan had indicated according to a statement from the Federal
Statistics Office.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Dollar hits 2-year low against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar slipped to fresh lows against the D-Mark and the yen yesterday
amid pessimism about the outlook for US financial markets.
The US currency touched a postwar low of Y96.35 and a two-year low of
DM1.4845, before recovering to close in New York at Y96.86 and DM1.4972.
Most analysts believe the dollar will fall further, and said the rally from
yesterday's lows was the result of technical factors rather than any shift
in investors' view of economic fundamentals.
Traders have blamed the recent weakness in the dollar and the US Treasury
bond market on the belief that the US Federal Reserve was acting too slowly
to combat inflation. On Monday, the long US Treasury bond yield closed above
8 per cent for the first time since 1992, leading to weakness in European
bond and equity markets yesterday.
European markets finished above their lowest levels for the day.
Nevertheless, German government bunds and UK gilts dropped about
three-quarters of a point.
In New York, the 30-year Treasury bond had receded a further  1/32 of a
point by late yesterday and was yielding 8.043 per cent, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average finished 4.71 lower at 3,850.59.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Major orders probe into rules for public life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major ordered a sweeping investigation into standards in public life
yesterday after the mounting allegations of sleaze in his government forced
the second ministerial resignation within a week.
During a day of high drama at Westminster, Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry
minister named last week as the recipient of hospitality from the Harrods
owner Mr Mohamed Fayed, was forced by Mr Major to quit the government.
But Mr Major's attempt to regain the initiative failed to dispel the
political controversy engulfing his government and brought charges from Mr
Tony Blair, the Labour leader, that he was in the thrall of events outside
of his control.
In a bitter resignation letter to the prime minister Mr Hamilton left no
doubt that he had left the government unwillingly. He said: 'I think it is
sad and deeply disturbing that I have been forced to leave office because of
foully motivated rumour and a media witch hunt.'
Mr Hamilton's dismissal also provoked unconcealed rage among his supporters
on the Tory right. They accused Mr Major of caving in to media pressure.
Despite an expression of support for the government in his resignation
letter, his friends said Mr Hamilton would prove a dangerous enemy on the
backbenches.
Mr Major said that, while he accepted the allegations were unsubstantiated,
as prime minister 'I must be concerned at the general perception of the
government and the capacity of ministers to carry out their work without
damaging distractions'. The resignation came 90 minutes before Mr Major told
MPs he had set up an independent commission chaired by Lord Nolan, a leading
judge, to review fundamentally the rules applying to holders of public
office.
Ministers, MPs, civil servants, council members and officers, and appointees
to quangos will all be subject to a review of their financial arrangements
and commercial relationships.
Mr Major told the Commons that he considered Mr Hamilton, who has insisted
throughout that he is innocent of any impropriety, was no longer able
effectively to carry out his ministerial duties. Earlier Mr Hamilton had
expressed regret that he had not declared details of a free stay at the
Ritz, the Paris hotel owned by Mr Fayed, in the Commons registry of members'
interests.
Last week Mr Tim Smith, a junior minister at the Northern Ireland office,
was forced to leave the government after admitting accepting payment from Mr
Fayed to table questions in the House of Commons.
The prime minister disclosed that fresh, unspecified allegations had been
levelled at Mr Hamilton since the completion yesterday of an investigation
by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, into the charges made by Mr
Fayed.
Downing Street refused to comment on the new allegations, which were
presented to Mr Hamilton during a meeting with Mr Richard Ryder, the chief
whip, in the presence of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary. However Tory party managers said they did not relate to Mr Fayed.
Mr Major was said also to have been furious at a statement released by Mr
Hamilton comparing his dilemma with that faced two years ago by the prime
minister over false allegations about an extra-marital affair. Amid an
astonishing series of charges and counter-charges between Mr Fayed and the
government, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, acknowledged that he had
been one of the subjects of the investigation carried out by Sir Robin.
Mr Howard said Sir Robin's report made clear he had committed no
impropriety. He said: 'I have never been guilty of any impropriety in the
conduct of any of my responsibilities as a minister or member of
parliament.'
The report, however, did little to suppress Westminster rumours about the
past links of other Conservatives with Mr Fayed.
It said that other ministers had been questioned as a result of the
allegations first passed to Mr Major three weeks ago. Sir Robin concludes
that the allegations were either 'demonstrably false' or 'so far as I have
been able to establish are entirely unsubstantiated'.
Mr Major was attacked by Mr Blair for insisting that investigations by the
Commons privileges committee be held in private. Mr Blair accused the prime
minister of using the wider investigation to 'sweep from public view'
charges against individual MPs government members.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Life groups may face Pounds 2bn bill on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurers must review hundreds of thousands of personal pensions sold
since 1988 and compensate those investors who were wrongly advised to buy
them, the Securities and Investments Board said yesterday.
Estimates of the potential bill for compensation are now put at up to Pounds
2bn by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants.
The SIB announcement came after a detailed study of the scale of poor advice
in selling personal pensions. It concluded that this was far greater than
had been thought.
'It is now clear that too many personal pensions were improperly sold in the
past,' said Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman.
The SIB, the City's chief regulator, has told life companies and independent
advisers to review the cases of at least 350,000 customers - those most
likely to have been damaged by bad advice - before the end of 1996.
Most life companies, including Prudential, the largest, reserved judgment on
the report. Some welcomed it, including Pearl Assurance and Bradford and
Bingley Building Society, the largest organisation to offer independent
advice.
Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life insurers, voiced dissent. Mr
David Prosser, chief executive, said the SIB had put too great a burden on
the life industry.
The Consumers' Association condemned the SIB report as 'wholly unacceptable'
because many people who did not join occupational schemes would not have
their cases reviewed.
Since 1988, some 600,000 personal pensions have been sold to people
transferring lump sums from occupational schemes. Separately, a survey for
the SIB by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow has also estimated that in some 850,000
cases, people were advised to opt out of employers' schemes or not to join.
Mr Large said the SIB's programme was intended to minimise the need for
investors to go to court to get compensation. It was keen to ensure that the
greatest number of cases where people had suffered were remedied in the
shortest time possible.

FT  26 OCT 94 / PM asks DPP to examine notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The director of public prosecutions has been asked by Mr John Major to
examine notes of a meeting between the prime minister and an intermediary,
who was allegedly acting on behalf of Mr Mohamed Fayed and supplied
allegations about payments to MPs.
Mr Major disclosed the involvement of the DPP in response to suggestions
from Sir Peter Tapsell, a Conservative backbencher, that Mr Fayed should be
prosecuted for blackmail.
Mr Major told MPs that the unnamed intermediary had made allegations against
several ministers, and requested a meeting between the prime minister and Mr
Fayed to discuss the Trade and Industry department's critical report into
the acquisition of House of Fraser, Harrods' parent company, by Mr Fayed and
his brother Ali.
The allegations were dismissed by Mr Fayed: 'In my life, I have never
authorised anyone to issue an ultimatum on my behalf,' he said. Mr Fayed
threatened to sue Sir Peter if he 'repeats his suggestion outside of the
Palace of Westminster'.
However, he said that in a meeting on September 22 with Mr Ian Greer, the
lobbyist who is said to have arranged the payments to MPs on Mr Fayed's
behalf, Mr Greer had 'said he could arrange a meeting with the prime
minister and offered to do so'. Mr Fayed said he had 'rejected his offer'.
Mr Greer last night denied having made such an offer and did not know why Mr
Fayed was seeking to implicate him.
Quoting from a report by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, Mr Major told
MPs: 'The informant said that Mr Al-Fayed wanted a meeting with the prime
minister, principally because of Mr Al-Fayed's wish to have the DTI
inspector's report on the takeover of the House of Fraser revised or
withdrawn.'
Mr Major said it had been impossible for him to see Mr Fayed in such
circumstances. 'If ministers had been guilty of wrongdoing, as Mr Al-Fayed
alleged, I was not going to make any sort of deal, regardless of the cost to
the government's reputation,' he said.
Mr Fayed said he was acutely aware that the DTI report could not be
withdrawn or publicly disavowed by the government.
Officials said the note of the meeting between Mr Major and the intermediary
had been passed to Mrs Barbara Mills, the DPP, 'pretty recently'.
Mr Fayed said he had wanted Mr Major to 'know of my experiences (in paying
MPs) in order that he could take action against malpractice wherever it
exists'.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Russian oil spill threatens disaster in Arctic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, JOHN THORNHILL and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A burning oil slick spilling from a pipeline in the northern Russian
province of Komi is threatening to create an environmental disaster in the
fragile Arctic.
Komi officials asked Moscow for help in dealing with the spill yesterday,
estimating that 200,000 barrels of oil had escaped. But Mr Bill White, the
US deputy energy secretary, said a US company at the site had estimated the
spill at 2m barrels, nearly eight times the size of the Exxon Valdez
disaster in Alaska.
Another western company had measured the slick at 1 metre deep and 12 metres
wide, stretching for 6-7 miles.
'It is a significant spill, whether it be 100,000 barrels or 2m or somewhere
in between. The fact is the Arctic environment heals a lot more slowly than
other environments,' Mr White said.
The oil slick is reported to have built up from leaks in a 47km pipeline run
by Komineft, a Russian oil production association. The leak is believed to
have begun in February, but had been retained by an earth dam.
After heavy rains early this month, the dam burst, spilling oil into the
Kolva River, which runs indirectly into the Pechora River and thence to the
Barents Sea. US officials say the slick was probably set on fire in an
attempt to contain it.
The US Department of Energy yesterday released a video of the leak showing
furiously flaming oil flowing down a river with snowy banks.
The Komi Republic is one of the richest of Russia's oil provinces, but its
government only advised the Moscow disaster centre yesterday, after news of
the spill was published in the US.
Russian government officials said last night the spill was under control and
that environmentalists' claims were alarmist. The pipeline breach had been
repaired and a team of experts had been flown out to complete the clean-up.
But the delay in releasing information about the accident is reminiscent of
Soviet-era secrecy, when details about disasters were regularly suppressed.
The region is of interest to western oil companies seeking to exploit the
nearby Timan-Pechora basin.
Vast areas of ecologically fragile Russian tundra have been churned up by
decades of exploration or turned into polluted bogs by oil from leaking
pipes and production platforms.
The latest accident is not an isolated incident in a country where
production at all costs has been the rule for decades. Much of the oil will
probably spread into the surrounding marshlands sodden with heavy autumn
rains.

<TEXT>
The US Justice Department's anti-trust division is 'looking at' Microsoft's
planned Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Intuit, a personal finance software
publisher.
The department routinely reviews takeover and merger plans to ensure they do
not create anti-competitive monopolies. However, it declined to characterise
its interest in the Microsoft-Intuit transaction, saying only that it had
not undertaken 'a review'.
Microsoft said the action was routine and not related to an anti-trust
consent decree signed by the company earlier this year, or to Justice
Department monitoring of the company's activities that stems from the
consent decree.
Microsoft critics have called for the department to undertake a broad
investigation of the implications of the acquisition of Intuit. 'This deal
concentrates too much power in one company,' said Mr David Coursey, editor
of PC Letter, an industry newsletter.
'Microsoft already dominates the PC operating system market and the PC
applications software market, now they want to control the on-line service
that provides financial services. It is the aggregation of all these
interests that should cause the Justice Department to take a second look at
Microsoft.'

<TEXT>
A planned Dollars 1.6bn merger between the US railroads Illinois Central and
Kansas City Southern has been abandoned after the two sides failed to reach
agreement, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Neither company would comment, but analysts speculated that a recent drop in
Illinois Central's share price scuppered the deal.
Under the terms of the original deal unveiled in July, Illinois Central, the
10th largest US railway system, was to have paid approximately Dollars 700m
in stock for Kansas City Southern, the country's 11th largest railway, and
assumed Dollars 929m in debt from the railway's parent, Kansas City Southern
Industries.
The union would have created a network spanning 14 midwestern and southern
states.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher card revenues lift
American Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After-tax profits from the continuing businesses of American Express climbed
18 per cent in the third quarter, due to higher revenues in its cards and
travel businesses and lower costs at IDS, its financial services subsidiary.
Net income of Dollars 369m, or 71 cents a share, compared with income on
continuing businesses of Dollars 313m, or 61 cents a share, a year ago.
Including profits from the Shearson broking firm, which has since been sold,
and Lehman Brothers, the investment bank spun off earlier this year, overall
net income in the 1993 third quarter was Dollars 420m, or 83 cents a share.
Revenues in American Express's core travel-related services area rose nearly
10 per cent, to Dollars 2.36bn.
About half the increase stemmed from an 11 per cent jump in discount
revenues from merchants, which reflected higher spending on the company's
cards.
An increase in the company's travel business, resulting partly from
acquisitions, accounted for the rest of the revenue growth. Overall, the
travel-related services businesses reported net income of Dollars 264m, up
13 per cent.
IDS had after-tax profits of Dollars 114m, up from Dollars 96m, on broadly
flat revenues of Dollars 822m. The earnings advance was partly attributable
to a Dollars 35m fall in operating costs, which the company said was due to
an absence of one-time factors which affected the 1993 period.

on higher prices

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Steel, the country's biggest steelmaker, reported a 40 per cent jump in
underlying operating income in the third quarter as higher steel prices
contributed to its continuing turnround.
The company, part of the USX group, said operating income (before a Dollars
13m gain from the sale of a coal seam) rose to Dollars 93m.
This represented Dollars 36 for each of the 2.6m tons produced, compared
with Dollars 27 a ton on production of 2.5m tons the year before.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman, said that 'ongoing price improvement and
efficient operating levels throughout our plants' meant that the company was
positioned to improve its results further.
Overall, US Steel's net income jumped Dollars 57m, to Dollars 90m. The
latest period was lifted by one-off credits of Dollars 32m, compared with
Dollars 11m in the year-ago quarter.
US Steel, like Marathon and Delhi, other subsidiaries of USX, has a separate
quote on the New York Stock Exchange. Its earnings per share reached Dollars
1.11, up from 41 cents.
Marathon, meanwhile, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 102m on sales of
Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 30m on sales of Dollars 3bn the year
before.
The results were lifted by a net Dollars 48m from asset disposals, after
deducting a charge for an inventory valuation adjustment and reorganisation
costs.
A higher oil price helped the company to report exploration and production
profits of Dollars 73m, compared with a loss of Dollars 9m the year before.
Operating income from refining and marketing slipped to Dollars 123m from
Dollars 146m, reflecting the lower profit margins on refined products being
achieved by all energy groups.
Marathon's earnings per share rose to 35 cents, from 10 cents the year
before.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Gruesome Gaucho - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the two most remarkable features of Doug Lucie's new play, Gaucho, is
the role of the protagonist, Declan Moss. A working-class Englishman, 40
this year, educated at Oxford, he has become the world's pre-eminent drug
baron, is reputed to have given money to the IRA, and currently lives safely
on a little island in the Aegean. And yet money is not his goal. He is a
perpetual outsider, a Utopian, who attacks middle-class values and 'the
system' and who hopes for the day when a new generation will reorder
society. When attacked about the damage done by drugs, he replies that
'drugs are a symptom, not the cause', and he takes them plentifully himself.
They are part of his entry into an alternative system, and into his greatest
goal: freedom.
All kinds of awkward tensions must exist within and around such a character,
and Lucie's play investigates a number of them. During the play, he and his
beautiful Romanian wife Yana are joined in their idyllic island retreat by
three of his old Oxford cronies - one of whom, Stephanie, is a journalist,
accompanied by her photographer, Marsh. They help, by accident and by
design, to pose questions about their host. How serious can Declan's
Utopianism really be? Are his exploitations really less selfish or less
cruel than those of the system he loathes?
Questions, however, arise about the rest of them too. How come they, unlike
Declan, are so hooked on Oxford nostalgia? They are far from exemplary
themselves, and indeed Lucie loads the dice rather too heavily against two
of them. Stephanie is a selfish money-worried middle-class Tory voter;
another of the cronies, Spencer, is a failed Tory candidate (among his other
failures); and both are alcoholics. Tories are always easy targets for a
good joke and a good hate, and it is not hard for Declan to look morally
pretty serious by contrast.
In the first scene, before the others arrive, we understand that Yana
sometimes chains him as part of love-
making. 'One day,' she tells him, 'you will find yourself chained up and I
won't be there any more.' At the time it seems she means she might simply
chain and abandon him. But, as the play develops, other interpretations
emerge. Yet - skilful of Lucie - we do not realise how her words prepare us
for the play's end.
It is also soon apparent that their idyll is threatened. And first one, then
another, of their visitors proves duplicitous. (Lucie never really convinces
us, actually, that Declan - who insists that he trusts nobody - would invite
this questionable bunch of ex-chums to his island.) This leads to the other
extraordinary feature of the play - in which, during one of those 10-minute
gunpoint climaxes that make me thrash around in my seat in terror, Declan
and Yana punish the first traitor by means so original and grotesque that
the audience gasps.
Lucie directs, and Tim McInnerny is excellent as Declan, catching both
violence and calm, rebellion and idealism, cynicism and sexuality, plus a
hint of the trapped animal. Only one of his big speeches sounds like the set
piece it is, amid a performance that is otherwise a model of complex,
assured naturalism. In the performances of the five actors who support him
(Julia Lane, Phyllis Logan, Dominic Jephcott, Kate Fahy, Grant Masters) it
is slightly easier to be reminded of the theatrical artifice of the whole
set-up. But the play is full of suspense. Even when you guess what may
happen next - there are clues to prepare you for Act One's gruesome climax -
you want to see how it will happen.
At the Hampstead Theatre, NW3.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Design of new houses attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A poll of homebuyers has found widespread dissatisfaction with the design of
the 180,000 homes built in the UK each year, Simon London writes.
The poll, by Gallup for Riba Journal, the architectural magazine, found that
60 per cent of housebuyers were dissatisfied with the design of new houses.
A similar percentage doubted whether they offered value for money and more
than 40 per cent questioned construction quality.
Other criticisms centred on the degree of choice and flexibility offered.
Nine out of ten people said housebuilders were not providing enough choice
in terms of design and more than 75 per cent wanted greater flexibility over
the layout of rooms.
The poll found that 3 per cent of the housebuying public would prefer to
live in an ultra-modern home. This suggests that there is a market for about
45,000 high-tech units each year.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Tory MP failed to declare interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Conservative MP last night expressed 'regret' that he had failed to record
in the Commons register of members' interest his relationship with a
consultancy company which had employed Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and
industry minister.
Mr Michael Colvin, the MP for Romsey and Waterside, said last night that he
had worked for a brief period for Strategy Network International.
He took up the post after Mr Hamilton, at the centre of a separate political
row over so-called 'cash for questions' allegations, joined the government
in mid-1990 and severed his connections with the consultancy.
Mr Colvin told the Financial Times that he had a 'trial run' with the
consultancy in 1991 but added: 'The relationship with the company did not
last.' The company represented a number of South African companies. Mr
Colvin had a long-standing interest in the country since he first visited it
in the 1950s and opposed the imposition of trade sanctions against the then
apartheid regime.
He said last night that his entry in the members' register for the year at
issue had been extremely detailed, including, for example, a free day's
fishing, courtesy of an industrial company.
Asked why the relationship had not been mentioned, Mr Colvin said: 'I am a
very assiduous declarer. The fact that SNI was not mentioned in that year
was an oversight that I regret.'
Mr Colvin declined, however, to comment on the size of the payment he
received, stressing that it was an 'absolute point of principle' that MPs
were not obliged to disclose such details.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Ownership of pension surplus is questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A comprehensive biennial review of UK accounting, published this week,
questions whether pension-fund surpluses really belong to employers.
The report, by Ernst and Young, the accountants, is based on detailed
examination of the accounts of 500 leading companies.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which reviews in 1,600 pages
company compliance with reporting standards, calls on the Accounting
Standards Board to reform the present code on pension funds.
The report says: 'It is not evident, as a matter of either law or economic
reality, that employers can regard pension fund surpluses as their own
unfettered property.'
Mr Ron Paterson, a technical partner with Ernst and Young, and one of the
authors, said: 'It is a difficult legal and moral question as to who owns
the surplus on a pension fund.'
At present a company is entitled to show the surplus on a pension fund as an
asset on the balance sheet but the report insists that in practice the
scheme members can generally exert a claim over the surpluses 'to some
degree'.
The report concludes that in the light of the Maxwell affair, and the review
of the legal framework for pensions following the Goode Report, the code for
accounting for pensions, known as SSAP 24, should be reviewed.
The authors say: 'The ASB should reassess whether the standard really fits
the legal and economic relationships which it is intended to portray.'
The report contains criticisms of some of the ASB's other standards. Mr
Paterson said: 'The board has grasped some nettles with vigour - but it is
not always as efficient as it might be. However, the general standard of
accounting is improving because of their efforts.'
The report adds, however: 'We are afraid that the ASB may be outrunning the
capacity of the accounting profession to absorb and apply these new and
often difficult rules.
'Both the content of future standards and the pace of their development need
to be less ambitious, or else a gulf might develop between theory and
practice, particularly in relation to small companies.'
The report criticises the ASB over - Financial Reporting Standard 7, on fair
values following an acquisition. While acknowledging that this will reduce
significant abuses it says the standard was produced in haste and 'a number
of issues have been ducked'.
The authors also attack FRS 5, on representing the substance of a business
in the accounts rather than following the legal form, as 'daunting' and
'elaborate'. It says the standard may encourage lawyers and merchant banks
to search for gaps in the standard to justify their accounts.
Mr Allan Cooke, technical director at the ASB, said that a discussion paper
on the future of SSAP 24 was due to appear in the first quarter of next
year.
He said that while there were valid concerns about abuses of SSAP 24 the
essence of many pensions schemes was that the employer took the balance of
the costs and there-fore had a claim on any surplus.
He added that during the preparation of FRS 5 extensive consultation had
taken place, including with the 'big six' accountancy firms, and that the
consensus had been for the inclusion of complex 'application notes'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / PIA hints at review of heavy fine tactic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shift away from the use of heavy fines for financial organisations which
fail to meet regulatory standards was signalled yesterday by Ms Colette
Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority.
Speaking at the Chartered Insurance Institute, Ms Bowe said that one task
facing the PIA, the watchdog to protect the private investor, was to develop
its own approach to discipline.
'My own personal view is that massive fines which, in the case of a mutual,
end up being paid by existing policyholders are not always the most
appropriate form of discipline,' she said.
Her comments appeared to contrast with the view taken by Lautro, the PIA's
predecessor in regulating life insurance companies.
The record penalty imposed by Lautro rose sharply this year from Pounds
180,000 levied on Legal &amp; General in February - to Pounds 300,000 - exacted
from Premium Life and Norwich Union in April.
Ms Bowe seemed to favour a clearer focus on individual responsibilities in
errant organisations - an approach which would require the PIA to introduce
a system of registering individuals as well as companies.
The regulator plans to issue consultation papers on both registration and
discipline early next year.
This will include the prospect of individual penalties not only for 'rogue'
sales agents but also for individual board members, including non-executive
directors.
One concern for regulators in considering discipline is that they value as a
deterrent the bad publicity a heavy fine attracts.

Miners at British Coal raised their output to an average of over 13 tonnes
per shift in the first six months of the company's financial year, compared
with 8 tonnes in the same period last year. But the sharp increase reflected
the closure of less productive pits.
Sales of coal outside the power-generation business rose 6.4 per cent to

FT  25 OCT 94 / Army scales down patrols in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The army has scaled down patrols in parts of Northern Ireland. Troops have
been withdrawn from the streets of Londonderry and in Strabane and Omagh,
County Tyrone.
The return to barracks by members of the King's Own Royal Border Regiment
and the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment was confirmed yesterday.
Army Headquarters at Lisburn, County Antrim, stressed that there had been no
troop withdrawal from the province. There are just less than 18,500
soldiers, the same as before the IRA ceasefire announcement.
Soldiers have been taken off security checkpoints on the Londonderry-Donegal
border. Four checkpoints were removed at the weekend from border crossing
points in County Donegal, and another lifted in County Leitrim.
Meanwhile, nationwide raids by Irish police on terrorist targets at the
weekend provided the first evidence of opposition in republican circles to
the IRA ceasefire and the peace process.
The raids by Gardai officers in four counties near the Ulster border
resulted in the seizure of guns, ammunition, hand grenades and detonators
belonging to a previously unknown group called the Irish National Republican
Army.
The operation will underscore the Irish desire to accelerate the peace
process and harness Sinn Fein and the broader republican movement to the
peace process. The operation follows a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, last Thursday.
A Gardai statement said the raids were directed against 'breakaway factions
such as Republican Sinn Fein and the Irish National Republican Army' which
were involved in 'criminal and subversive activity'.
Republican Sinn Fein is a splinter group established after a break with Sinn
Fein in 1986, when Mr Adams abandoned the movement's policy of boycotting
elections in the republic in a bid to raise local support.
The RSF, with the more extremist IRA offshoot, the Irish National Liberation
Army, has refused to endorse the August 31 decision to call a ceasefire.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Portillo claims Jobseeker's Allowance will save Pounds 200m
a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled details of its new Jobseeker's Allowance,
describing it as 'a major step forward in the reform of the benefit system
and in the help given to the jobless'.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, said the government estimated the
scheme would mean a Pounds 100m net cut in its spending on unemployment in
its first financial year 1996-1997, followed by reductions of Pounds 200m
for every succeeding year. But he was unable to say what impact the
allowance would have in reducing the number of registered unemployed.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said an estimated 150,000
unemployed people a year should benefit from the introduction of the
back-to-work bonus, an accumulated credit of up to Pounds 1,000 for
part-time work done while unemployed, paid after moving into full-time
employment.
He told the Commons the allowance would 'help Britain generate more jobs and
give better value for taxpayers' money'.
Mr John Monks, the Trades Union Congress general secretary, condemned the
allowance as 'mean-spirited and irrelevant'. Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's new
shadow employment secretary, said the allowance would 'not help a single
person back into work and is simply a new penalty against the unemployed'.
Since 1986 gradual steps have been taken to tighten up the benefit system to
stamp out false claims and increase pressure on the jobless to find work.
The allowance will introduce a simpler way of assisting the unemployed than
before.
It will be paid instead of unemployment benefit and income support to any
eligible person without work for six months or less, and dealt with through
a single office - the existing Jobcentre. The complex system run by the
employment and social security departments with different rules, locations
and bureaucracies will be swept away.
The allowance, based on current income support levels, will not be
means-tested for the first six months of receipt. At present unemployment
benefit is paid automatically for the first 12 months a person is without
work.
The unemployed will have to sign an agreement to receive the allowance. This
will require a jobseeker 'to be available for any work which they can
reasonably be expected to do', in line with the current benefit requirement
requiring a claimant to be actively seeking work.
The employment service will - as now - be able to insist on allowance
claimants participating - if asked - in its many programmes designed to help
the jobless back to work. After six months only a jobless person with no
money or only a small amount will qualify automatically for the allowance.
Everybody else will be means-tested. Anybody with capital resources
amounting to more than Pounds 8,000 will be ineligible.
The government estimates that 90,000 claimants will lose their benefit
entitlement in the first year of the allowance with a further 150,000 having
to switch to means-tested benefits, often at reduced rates. Mr Portillo may
be keen to make the incentive for the jobless to find work more attractive
but his white paper falls far short of doing this.
At present an unemployed person can keep only Pounds 5 a week of any money
earned while receiving the allowance. After that benefit is reduced by a
pound for every pound of earnings.
This provision has not been uprated for six years - nor will it be under the
new allowance. But the government is introducing a 'back to work bonus' for
anybody unemployed for three months or more, built up as a lump sum
entitlement based on part-time earnings. As now, they can still keep the
first Pounds 5 a week of any part-time earnings while a couple retains the
first Pounds 10.
In addition, for every pound earned over that level they will build up a 50p
credit entitlement paid out as a bonus only when the jobseeker secures a
full-time job. The maximum bonus amount accumulated at any one time can be
Pounds 1,000. But this means a jobseeker will receive no extra money
immediately for part-time work - hardly an incentive.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: German growth forecasts soar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's six leading economic institutes have doubled their growth
forecasts for the country's economy this year and next, but believe
unemployment will remain high. According to excerpts of a report, to be
released today but obtained by Reuters and reported by Die Welt newspaper,
gross domestic product in the west will grow by 2 per cent this year and 2.5
per cent in 1995; in the east 8.5 per cent is forecast for both years.
Pan-German economic growth will reach 2.5 per cent this year and 3 per cent
in 1995. Their forecasts coincide with federal economics ministry figures
showing increased orders for east German manufacturers in August spurred by
a sharp rise in consumer spending. At the same time, the Bundesbank's
September report showed that real gross domestic product in east Germany
rose by 9 per cent in the first half of this year over the previous year.
According to the ministry, on a month-to-month basis manufacturing orders in
August rose 4.5 per cent and increased on a year-to-year basis by 25.5 per
cent. Judy Dempsey, Berlin
European Union industrial production rose by 5.4 per cent in July compared
to a year earlier. The Eurostat statistics agency said this was the sixth
consecutive monthly rise. Seasonally adjusted production from May to July
was 1.8 per cent higher than in the preceding three months.
IMF approved a Dollars 201m loan for Lithuania to help it reform its economy
and ease inflation. Economic growth of 6.75 per cent is projected next year
after 1.5 per cent this year, with inflation being cut to 20 per cent after
71 per cent this year.

<TEXT>
Adia, the Swiss temporary employment group controlled by Mr Klaus Jacobs,
has reported net income of SFr25.1m (Dollars 19.4m) in the first nine months
of 1994 compared with a loss of SFr112.2m in the same period of 1993.
Mr John Bowmer, chief executive, forecast that net income in the full year
would exceed SFr30m, a large increase on the SFr20m forecast he made in
July.
Revenues were up 11.3 per cent to SFr2.59bn, or 18 per cent in local
currencies. Adia attributed almost all of the growth to a higher volume of
temporary hours sold.
Mr Bowmer said the gathering pace of recovery in continental Europe had
fuelled 'our excellent results'. The French operations had performed well in
spite of extensive restructuring.
Swiss business was running over 50 per cent ahead of last year in hours
sold. Revenues in Germany and the Benelux countries were well ahead in the
third quarter.
Business growth was strong in the US, the UK and Australia, but growth in
these markets was slowing as the economic recovery matured.
Mr Bowmer said Adia had reached an agreement in principle for the settlement
of litigation challenging the terms under which it has agreed to acquire the
19 per cent of Adia Services, its US subsidiary, that it does not own.

<TEXT>
ICF Kaiser, a US engineering group, is to head an international consortium
to prepare project financing for the construction of a Dollars 250m
mini-mill for Nova Hut, the Czech steel producer.
The consortium, which includes Tippins, a US steel producer, and Samsung
Heavy Industries of South Korea, may also take a 49 per cent stake in a
joint venture with the state-owned Czech group.
A consortium of international banks, possibly including the International
Finance Corporation, a private affiliate of the World Bank, will provide
Dollars 150m for the project. The remaining Dollars 100m is likely to come
in paid-in capital from a joint venture between Nova Hut and the ICF-led
consortium, with the Czech company contributing Dollars 51m and the foreign
group, Dollars 49m.
Mr Adrian Basora, the US ambassador in Prague, called the deal the biggest
US greenfield investment to date in the Czech Republic. The mini-mill will
provide 200 jobs and produce an annual 1m tonnes of steel. Construction work
is expected to start in early 1998.
Nova Hut is 67 per cent state owned and employs 17,000. Last year it posted
profits of Kcs1.05bn (Dollars 37m) on turnover of Kcs21.32bn, down 50.8 per
cent and 5.4 per cent respectively on 1992.

FT  25 OCT 94 / US offers Cuba small hope for dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Cuba and the US renewed talks on immigration issues in Havana yesterday
there was little sign the meeting would satisfy initial Cuban hopes for a
wider dialogue on the longstanding US-Cuban conflict.
The talks were scheduled to review progress of an immigration accord signed
on September 9 that will sharply increase the number of Cubans allowed to
migrate legally to the US each year. The September agreement halted an
exodus by sea of thousands of Cubans trying to reach the US without entry
visas.
Both sides have have expressed a willingness to make the immigration deal
work, but Washington has resisted Cuban pressure for full-scale negotiations
on bigger issues such as the US trade and financial embargo against the
island.
Cuba's foreign minister Roberto Robaina admitted to a parliamentary foreign
affairs committee on Saturday there were 'no new elements' to suggest the
mere continuation of the immigration talks would lead to immediate
significant improvements in relations.
The US even appeared to have downgraded the importance of its delegation to
the Havana talks. Instead of Mr Michael Skol, deputy assistant secretary of
state, who took part in the September negotiations, the US team in Havana
was led by a lower-ranking official, the head of the State Department's Cuba
desk. Cuba is keeping its same chief negotiator, Mr Ricardo Alarcon,
president of Cuba's National Assembly and a member of the Communist party
politburo.
While the latest talks have no fixed agenda, Cuba was was thought likely to
press for a quick start to the expanded US visa programme. The increased
visa processing has been delayed because additional consular staff had to be
sent to the US Interests Section in Havana to help cope with the extra work.
US officials say between 26,000 and 27,000 Cubans are expected to be granted
visas to migrate legally over the next year, through accelerated processing
procedures, expanded criteria for refugee status and an immigration lottery
to start on November 1.

Germany's parliament speaker yesterday urged parliaments to play a stronger

Sussmuth told a meeting of MPs from the Twelve and from prospective EU
members that legislatures, especially national ones but also the European
parliament, had to join in debate ahead of a 1996 summit conference on
strengthening the Union. 'The negotiations by governments must never again
take place out of view of the public, as happened with the Maastricht
treaty,' she said according to an advance copy of her speech. 'The best
understanding of democracy is that public interest is best represented by
the participation of parliaments, which are elected for this purpose.' The
Maastricht accords on political and monetary union will be reviewed at the
1996 summit of EU leaders, who will have to decide on possible institutional
reforms to bolster integration.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Australia raises rates to counter threat of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Reserve Bank of Australia yesterday raised its official money market
interest rates by 1 percentage point to 6.5 per cent. It was the second rise
in less than two months even though the annual inflation rate is only 1.7
per cent.
The move adds Australia to the list of countries, including the UK and the
US, which have tried to tighten policy early in an effort to ward off rises
in inflation.
Financial markets had been expecting a move, but were surprised at the size
of the increase. The equity market responded with a rise of 2.8 points in
the Sydney All Ordinaries Index to 2,037, while the yield on 10-year
government bonds eased 13 basis points to 10 per cent.
The Australian dollar gained half a US cent in European trading to 73.66
cents. but it failed to break the 74 cent barrier. London dealers said there
was concern that inflation data for the quarter to the end of September, due
to be published tomorrow, might show price rises accelerating.
'The decision was taken to keep inflation low in the context of continuing
evidence of strong economic growth and because buoyant conditions are likely
to continue through the current year and 1995-96,' said Mr Ralph Willis, the
Australian treasurer.
The move has echoes of the UK's decision to raise base rates by a half point
in September, and its size contrasts with the quarter-point moves adopted by
the US Federal Reserve when it started raising rates in February this year.
Australia's economy is growing at over 4 per cent. Mr Willis said government
forecasts of a growth rate of 4.25 per cent in gross domestic product in the
year to June 1995 now looked 'a little bit pessimistic'.
There would be 'real problems in terms of maintaining low inflation' if the
growth rate moved over 5 per cent, he added.
The increase was announced yesterday morning by Mr Bernie Fraser, the
Reserve Bank governor, who said it was a response to a faster-than-expected
increase in both retail spending and investment.
Interest rates were last raised by three-quarters of a point on August 17,
the first increase for five years.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Germany begins coalition talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and leader of the liberal Free
Democratic party, arrives for a meeting of his party's leadership yesterday
to finalise demands for coalition talks with Chancellor Helmut kohl.
Negotiations to form Germany's next government seemed likely to be smoother
than expected after members of the FDP, which has kept the coalition in
power since 1982, emerged from the talks much more united than before they
began.
Mr Kohl's party, the Christian Democratic Union, has said it wants
negotiations completed quickly so that parliament can re-elect Mr Kohl as
chancellor in the week beginning November 14.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Making a meal of a dog's dinner: The world petfood market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pampered pooches and pussies support large petfood industries on both sides
of the Atlantic - but the markets in the US and Europe are as different as
cats and dogs.
The idea of making and selling food for pets was American, although English
dogs can claim the inspiration. Mr James Spratt of Cincinnati, Ohio, created
the dog biscuit industry a century ago after watching dogs scavenging for
biscuits on an English dock.
Canned dog food quickly followed, and soon fortunes were being made. Fans of
PG Wodehouse novels will remember how keen the English aristocracy was to
marry its sons to US dog biscuit heiresses.
In the mature US and UK markets, where growth has stagnated, consolidation
and rationalisation appear to be the ways forward for petfood manufacturers,
but there seems plenty of scope for growth in the rest of Europe. Spain, for
example, spent just Pounds 200m on petfood last year compared with Pounds
1.2bn in the UK.
The contrast between the two markets reflects differences in living habits
and retail structure. Many more Britons give their pets prepared food bought
from supermarkets, while in southern Europe, pets are fed more on kitchen
scraps.
The different outlooks for the Anglo-Saxon and continental markets were
highlighted by two recent deals. Nestle, the world's largest foods group,
paid Dollars 510m (Pounds 323m) to Grand Metropolitan, the UK food and
drinks group, for Alpo, its US petfoods business. The purchase took Nestle
to second place in the US, behind market leader Ralston Purina, which has
about 19 per cent.
Dalgety, the UK food and agribusiness group, bought two privately owned
Spanish petfood companies to expand its continental business.
Nestle believes its purchase could make it market leader in canned dog food
in the US. A recent study by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, showed
Nestle had 14 per cent of this market and 4 per cent in the EU; it also has
39 per cent of the US canned cat food market and 10 per cent in the EU.
Figures from the Washington-based Pet Food Institute show that US pet owners
spent Dollars 4.99bn on dog food and Dollars 3.44bn on cat food last year.
Nestle competes with Mars and Quaker Oats on both sides of the Atlantic.
Mars is clear market leader in Europe with a 47.3 per cent share in 1993
grocery store sales, while Nestle languishes in fourth place.
Dalgety is thought to have paid about Pounds 17m for the two Spanish
companies - Nido Industrial and Pet-Bon - which have combined assets of
Pounds 11m. The move takes it into Spain for the first time.
The deal follows Dalgety's Pounds 42m acquisition last November of Paragon
Petcare from British Petroleum, which gave it access to the French, German,
Dutch and Belgian markets. Dalgety now considers itself second to Mars in
the European market in volume terms, although just below Quaker by value.
It is difficult to get an overall picture of the market, as it can be
divided by country; between cat and dog; 'wet' (canned) and dry; and grocery
and non-grocery. But Dalgety's best estimates suggest plenty of scope for
higher sales in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium.
In Italy, for example, 82 per cent of the calorific value required to
support the 7m cats comes from commercial petfood, with 89 per cent for a
dog population of 6m. Italy's prepared petfood market, comprising 102,000
tonnes of cat food and 120,000 tonnes of dog food, was worth only Pounds
479,000 last year. In the UK a comparable 7m cats put away 549,000 tonnes,
while 6.8m dogs consumed 619,000 tonnes.
While Europe remains a collection of local markets, Mars has started to
unify it through the strong brand presence of Pedigree Chum and Whiskas.
Mr Richard Clothier, Dalgety's chief executive, argues that cats in Italy
and Scotland should like the same food - unlike the human population.

FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Airways lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways tumbled 7 to 370p following news that USAir, in which BA has
a 25 per cent stake, had run up another big loss for its third quarter and
was downbeat about trading in the final three months of 1994.
BA paid Dollars 400m for its stake in USAir. Yesterday's losses - Dollars 3
a share, or possibly a full dollar above analysts' projections - led the
market to speculate on the possibility of BA writing off all, or part of,
its investment.
The combination of a weak US dollar and bearish comments from one US
investment bank ensured that Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, was one of
the FT-SE 100's principal casualties yesterday.
The shares were down 18 in early trading and against the trend. Goldman
Sachs published a research overview reiterating its negative stance on the
stock and voicing concern over the long-term prospects for Wellcome's herpes
franchise. Then, as it was noted that the dollar was continuing its weak
trend, the shares slid further with the market to close 24 lower at 627p on
desultory turnover.
Elsewhere in the sector SmithKline Beecham was affected by a Sunday
newspaper report that the US Food and Drug Administration was launching an
inquiry into its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager DPS. The shares
fell 8 1/2 to 411p.
The share buy-back story, including talk of special one-off dividend
payments, spilled over into the banks arena, driving stocks such as Barclays
and TSB sharply higher.
Barclays raced up to 585p early in the session, as the stories took hold,
but later fell sharply to close unchanged on balance at 572p after the bank
poured cold water on the suggestions. The bank said it would require
shareholder authority for such a move. Turnover in Barclays reached a hefty
8.1m shares.
TSB, which already has shareholder authority to buy in its own shares, edged
up 3 1/2 to 224 1/2 p.
Life assurance stocks marked time ahead of an announcement from the
Securities and Investment Board, expected this afternoon, regarding
compensation for the victims of miss-selling of policies by life assurance
salesmen.
Scottish and Newcastle and Whitbread stood out in a dull market, although
the failure of the Lazard Brewers Investment Trust new issue came too late
to affect sentiment in the sector. The merchant bank said applications for
less than 10m units had been received - out of 215m on offer - and the
issue, aimed at investment in UK regional brewers, will not go ahead.
Bass ended 4 lower at 530p. In low activity, S&amp;N and Whitbread, the two
brewers felt to be at the forefront of any industry rationalisation, rose 6
to 521p and 5 to 552p.
Stores group Marks &amp; Spencer added 4 1/2 at 425 1/2 p after Hoare Govett
underlined its enthusiastic stance at its morning meeting. It believes
interim profits in early November will show an increase of around 9 per cent
from last year's Pounds 312.7m and pointed out the bottom line benefits of
M&amp;S trading on the four Sundays before Christmas.
Rank Organisation edged up 2 to 415p ahead of expected good third quarter
results from Xerox Corporation on Thursday and market confidence in a
favourable trading statement from the UK's leading leisure group on Friday.
Filtronic Comtek, which designs and manufactures components for mobile
telephones, put up a good performance on its stockmarket debut, the shares,
offered for sale at 105p, opened at 108p and progressed to 119p before
settling at 113p.

FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Low for APV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV fell 6 1/2 to to a new low for the year of 61 1/2 p after the food
processing equipment specialist denied a weekend report that it was in
danger of breaching banking covenants. Turnover was heavy at 2.6m shares.
The group, which last month cut the interim dividend and said profits
margins were under increasing pressure, last week ousted its chief executive
and warned of an unspecified charge to cover further restructuring at its
liquid foods division.
APV said that on current projections, it expected to stay within its
covenants, but declined to detail what they were. Analysts' estimates of the
restructuring charge range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m.
Market talk suggested that a number of potential industry bidders were
beginning to run their eye over the shares which were 138p earlier this
year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Channel tunnel group Eurotunnel had another active day with 2.6m shares
changing hands and the shares recovering 12 to 221p as rumours of
institutional muscle-flexing buzzed through the market.
There was a strong suggestion that a number of institutions were seeking
compensation for losses suffered on shares taken up at the 265p rights issue
last May.
Sentiment was also helped as tickets for the service from London to the
Continent went on sale for the first time and sales agents were swamped with
demand.

FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs on dividend alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday's rumours of a one-off special dividend of 85p from East
Midlands Electricity were confirmed at the outset of trading yesterday and
produced a flurry of heavy buying across the sector as analysts told their
institutional clients to expect more of the same from other regional
electricity companies, or Recs. And East Midlands is also expected to offer
another special dividend to shareholders in the event of a successful
sell-off of the National Grid, in which the Recs hold substantial stakes.
Dealers said the market focused its attention on those Recs that have
authority to buy in their own shares but have not not yet done so. The
favourite to launch a similar move to that undertaken by East Midlands was
Southern, closely followed by Yorkshire and Eastern.
East Midlands shares were adjusted at the outset and quoted ex the special
payment, eventually closing at 666p.
Yorkshire gave the best performance in the sector, closing 29 higher at 715p
followed by Southern, 25 higher at 751p and Eastern, up 19 at 756p. Norweb
put on 18 at 780p and South West 15 at 743p.
Specialists said the the odds were that the Treasury would move in next
month's budget to close what is viewed as a loophole regarding share buy
backs.

FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFERY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved lower with turnover slumping to one of its lowest
levels of the year, writes Jeffery Brown.
At times the market traded at a discount to cash equities but with volume
tailing away to little more than a third of Friday's level there was never
any real weight of selling.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,030 at the official 4:10 close, down
12 points. At this level there was a one point premium to the cash market
while the fair value premium was around 15 points.
Traders said the low level of activity - there were 5,523 contracts, against
13,340 on Friday - was a clear reflection of the absence of directional
leads.
They pointed to the low status of the economic data due this week, and said
that a number of the larger traders had decided to stay away for the schools
half-term holiday.
One trader described both stock index and option volume as 'wickedly low'.
Activity in traded options was just 13,951 lots, down from 48,235 lots on
Friday. Of this, FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just under 8,000
lots.
The most active individual stock option was the Prudential with 757 lots
followed by HSBC with 642 lots.

FT  25 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Currency factors reverse early gains
in shares - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once again, weakness in the US dollar undermined a firm start on the UK
stock market yesterday and although trading volumes were low, share prices
were turning easier at the end of the session. Traders commented that it was
uncertainty over official US policy towards the dollar that was upsetting
London stocks rather than any precise analysis of the implications for
profits at the blue chip companies.
The market opened firmly as London responded to the dollar's rally late on
Friday, which followed suggestions from Washington that the US authorities
would intervene to support the currency. Helped also by a rebound in stock
index futures, the FT-SE 100 Share Index jumped by 20 points to 3,052.9 in
early deals.
Trading volume was painfully thin, however, and gains melted as the dollar
failed to live up to its early promise and UK government bonds shaded lower.
Confidence also cooled when bonds softened following regional consumer price
data from Germany.
But the market held the line when Wall Street opened higher, and it was not
until dollar weakness had turned the Dow Average downwards and bond markets
had extended their falls that the Footsie slipped into negative territory.
The Dow was 6 points off in UK hours.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a net fall of 3.7 at 3,029.1 and
dealers looked with some concern at the approach of the 3,000 level. The
FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 2.2 to 3,500.2 as buyers continued to back away
across the broad range of the market.
A more revealing picture of the day's trading came from the official
business volume figures. Turnover through Seaq, the market's electronic
trading network, fell by nearly 12 per cent from Friday's figure, returning
a total of only 456.3m shares. This is well below what are generally agreed
to be profitable levels from the point of view of the London-based
securities industry. About 60 per cent of the day's trade was in non-Footsie
stocks.
The fall in market indices would have been greater but for sharp rise in
shares in the regional electricity companies after East Midlands Electricity
had announced a Pounds 186.5m special dividend payment to shareholders.
Other electricity companies have returned cash to shareholders by way of
share buy-backs but this policy has become frustrated by the strong share
prices in the sector. The market now looks for other electricity companies
to follow the East Midlands lead, although there were signs yesterday of
political objections.
Although the focus was on the dollar-orientated stocks, losses among these
issues were not large. Wellcome was a weak spot but this was ascribed to
negative comments from a US investment bank known to be bearish on the stock
rather than to currency factors. Other pharmaceutical issues also gave
ground, but Glaxo managed to hold steady in spite of currency influences.
Currency nerves benefited stocks seen as domestically-focused and therefore
likely to attract investors seeking to avoid dollar risk. Some store and
retail issues gained ground, although buyers were very selective and backed
away when the market turned sour.
The uncertainty in the London stock market is likely to focus on the next
round of data on the US economy, due at the end of the week. On Friday, US
gross domestic product statistics for the third quarter will be accompanied
by the deflator figure which has been identified as a key factor in the
inflation watch maintained by the US Federal Reserve Board.
The economic schedule in the UK is quiet this week, and dealers doubt if the
latest survey of industrial trends by the Confederation of British Industry
will bring any strong response from the stock market.

FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as long bond
yield climbs
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US share prices tumbled yesterday as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
breached the 8.00 per cent mark and held firm, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 36.00 lower at 3,855.30, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 4.06 at 460.83.
On the NYSE, declining issues led advances by more than two to one, on
moderate volume of 282m shares.
Other leading indices were also weaker. The Nasdaq composite was off 4.17 at
761.21 and the American SE composite was down 2.62 at 453.73.
There was no fresh economic news released during the morning, allowing
stocks to open on a positive note. Sentiment was bolstered by news of a
better-than-expected third-quarter performance by Caterpillar, a bellwether
cyclical issue.
The stock closed up Dollars 2 at Dollars 58 1/4 , but the early optimism
inspired by the company had petered out by mid-morning as investors turned
their attention to developments in the bond market.
Before midday, stocks reversed course as the yield on the benchmark long
bond climbed up to above 8.00 per cent, a level at which it had flirted for
the past fortnight. When there was no retrenchment during the afternoon, the
damage to share prices grew worse.
The action in both markets reflected the weakened value of the dollar and
heightened expectations of an early boost in short-term interest rates by
the Federal Reserve.
Among the Dow components, Alcoa dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 86 1/4 ,
IBM lost Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 73 and Eastman Kodak shed Dollars 1 7/8 to
Dollars 47 7/8.
In transport, Airborne Freight said its earnings had fallen to 38 cents a
share, from 53 cents a year earlier. The stock plunged 24 per cent to
Dollars 19 1/8 on the news.
Elsewhere, USAir was marked down Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 4 1/4 on
disappointing results, while AMR, parent of American Airlines, shed Dollars
1 5/8 to Dollars 5 3/8.
Exxon was one of four oil groups reporting third-quarter results. The
company exceeded analysts' forecasts by posting net income of 92 cent a
share, but the stock dipped Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 59 1/2.

FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness of the dollar exerted its influence over the world's equity
markets last week, with heavy falls seen among senior bourses. The two high
spots were Australia and South Africa which, measured by the FT-Actuaries
World index series, managed respective rises of nearly 2 per cent and 3 per
cent in local currency terms.
South Africa has been attracting investment interest following the election
of the country's first ever multi-racial democratic government earlier this
year. Lehman Brothers notes that the future direction of the country's
financial markets jwill depend on whether the government can carry out
necessary economic and social reforms. However, the broker concludes,
'barring any adverse political or external factors, the downside for the
market remains limited, as valuations are supported by the stronger earnings
momentum coming from the global recovery and strengthening commodity
prices.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late-closing bourses lose
their early inspiration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar's inability to hold on to hard-won gains in Europe yesterday
afternoon, and Wall Street's weak midsession after an encouraging start left
late-closing bourses bereft of inspiration, writes Our Markets Staff.
Most indications were that bourse turnover was low, or very low. It was
described as 'pathetic' in some quarters.
PARIS started the new account firmer but by the close had lost all the early
gains as Wall Street and the dollar weakened. The CAC-40 index closed down
0.50 at 1,841.59, after a session high of 1,865.00. Turnover was about
FFr2bn.
Bollore Technologies rose FFr25.80 to FFr452.80 after a year's high, during
the session, of FFr457.90. The diversified industrial group registered one
of the day's best performances following news that it was to make a further
round of asset sales worth FFr2bn, while some brokers moved to raise their
recommendations on the stock.
Hoare Govett noted that the group had been a beneficiary of a strong
exposure to the economic recovery, while other brokers expected further
outperformance as the company took firm restructuring measures in an effort
to reduce its debt burden to some FFr4bn by the end of the year.
Docks de France, the retail group, moved up FFr13 to FFr709 after announcing
a gain in nine month sales to the end of September while, on the opposite
tack, Accor dipped FFr21 to FFr509 ahead of today's first half figures which
are expected to show a sharp fall. Axa, which is due to release its six
month results tomorrow, slipped 50 centimes to FFr239.
FRANKFURT steadied after last week's 4 per cent decline, the Dax index
easing 3.16 higher to 2,025.38 in turnover down from DM7bn to DM4.7bn. The
recovery was minimal compared with the session fall of 47.73, or 2.3 per
cent last Friday, and it almost disappeared after hours; the Ibis-indicated
Dax closed the afternoon at 2,022.64.
Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf noted that the dollar was
relatively stable, that the bond market had traded in a narrow range and
that inflation statistics from Baden Wurtemnberg and North Rhine Westphalia
were regarded as good news.
However, there was nothing really to enliven the market, and the main
feature in blue chips was a selection including the big three chemicals,
Deutsche and Bayernhypo in banks, and Linde and Preussag in engineers
recovering some of last week's sector rotation losses with gains of 1 per
cent and upwards.
There was a bigger recovery in Weru, the window frame manufacturer, which
rose DM45 to DM870; this followed a slide on broker downgrades from DM1130
last Tuesday.
AMSTERDAM maintained its composure and the Aex index finished with a rise of
1.48 at 401.33.
There was interest in DSM, up Fl 2.20 at Fl 144.00, ahead of third quarter
results due next Monday. Reviewing the group's prospects, Goldman Sachs said
that it had raised its nine month forecast for the company to Fl 290m,
compared with a loss of Fl 24m in the same 1993 period.
Another chemical group, Akzo Nobel, due to report on November 2, added 10
cents to Fl 202.70. Goldman commented that the shares had been
underperforming the market recently on worries that a major shareholder
might sell stock after November 7 when a 'standstill agreement' expires.
Nedlloyd remained unsettled following Friday's 4 per cent fall with the
shares rising to Fl 49.80 before closing off 40 cents at Fl 48.50.
ZURICH, closing earlier than Paris, or Frankfurt's Ibis system, was lifted
by renewed interest in dollar-sensitive shares and the SMI index closed 16.6
higher at 2,625.2.
Among chemical shares, Ciba-Geigy rose SFr17 to SFr737; brokers called this
a technical rebound and pointed, too, to support from SBC's launch of a new
series of covered warrants on Ciba registered stock.
Union Bank led active stocks with a rise of SFr11 to SFr1,250 while, in
insurers, Winterthur rose SFr17 to SFr644 and Swiss Re by SFr13 to SFr748.
MILAN made modest forward progress, but traders suggested that the gains
were mainly due to technical trading and volume remained low. The Comit
index closed up 4.30 at 621.79.
Fiat, depressed by speculative selling last Friday, recovered L105 to
L6,135.
Brokers saw buying among telecommunications stocks, with Telecom Italia
rising L155 to L4,070 and Stet L115 to L4,495.
RAS, the insurance group, lost L180 to L18,910 ahead of a press conference
today.
MADRID's heavy weighting in banks and utility stocks stood it in good stead
for once, the general index closing 0.10 higher at 293.24; but turnover was
only Pta11.9bn, one of the lowest figures this year, and brokers said that
the day's performance was no measure of sentiment in a market which is still
generally bearish.
Santander led banks with a rise of Pta60 to Pta4,980 while the obviously
weak links were in construction where Cubiertas fell Pta320 to Pta7,900 and
Uralita Pta25 to Pta1,285.
ISTANBUL fell 3.6 per cent, the composite index losing 898.38 at 23,905.07
as expectations for a rate rise in today's three-month T-bill auction, and
fears of higher foreign currency prices ahead of Wednesday's L29,000bn bond
maturity discouraged buyers.
WARSAW's recent pessimism was strengthened by Friday's decision by the lower
house of parliament to introduce a 0.3 per cent stock transaction tax from
January. The Wig index fell 341.2, or 3.8 per cent to 8,637.8.

FT  25 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Chinese fund project
boosts Shanghai A shares

<TEXT>
Activity eased on continued worries over the movement of the yen, and the
Nikkei average closed marginally lower on selling by dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index lost 46.71 to 19,852.37 after a high of 19,952.89 in
the morning and a low of 19,830.57 in the afternoon. Some foreigners were
seen selling export linked stocks and buying domestic demand related stocks.
Volume was 180m shares against 238m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks declined 3.75 to 1,575.19 and the Nikkei 300 fell 0.93 to 288.00.
Losers led gainers by 538 to 400 with 235 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.53 to 1,295.28.
Investors were awaiting the listing of Japan Tobacco on Thursday. Although
worries have receded about a wave of selling similar to that seen when East
Japan Railway was listed last year traders said that price fluctuations in
the stock would still affect investor confidence.
Nikko Securities reported that the market was approaching a 'high risk zone'
because of the high number of new equity issues which have been made amid
the current low trading volumes.
Japan Telecom, the benchmark for former state owned companies, fell Y50,000
to Y3.75bn. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y5,000 to Y890,000, while
East Japan Railway was unchanged at Y483,000.
Electricals were mixed - Hitachi rose Y7 to Y997 and Toshiba added Y12 to
Y763, but Sony fell Y40 to Y5,770. Car makers were lower with Nissan Motor
down Y6 to Y846 and Toyota Motor losing Y30 to Y2,080.
Steels were actively traded but closed lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel
down Y2 to Y388, and Kawasaki Steel off Y6 to Y442.
Tsumura, a Chinese herb medicine maker, failed to trade following last
week's reports alleging that the company had been involved in fictitious
deals to boost revenue. Although the company denied the reports, the stock
closed at an offered price of Y1,120, down by its daily limit of Y200.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 45.03 to 22,096.91 in volume of 33m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y120 to Y5,180.
Roundup
Chinese initiatives moved equities in Hong Kong and, more obviously, on the
mainland.
The Shanghai Securities News quoted an official in the Securities Commission
of the State Council as saying that urgent measures must be taken to
stabilise share prices, and that one avenue would be to explore and
establish stock investment funds 'as soon as possible.'
In Hong Kong, meanwhile, sentiment was boosted by the Chinese negotiator,
Guo Fengmin, who hoped that a financing arrangement could be worked out for
the airport by early November.
Wellington and Bangkok were closed for holidays, as well as Colombo on
account of an island-wide curfew imposed after the assassination of Sri
Lanka's opposition leader, Mr Gamini Dissanayake.
HONG KONG's renewal of airport financing hopes took the Hang Seng index up
from an intraday drop of 128 points to close 25.70 higher at 9,364.29.
Guo told reporters that differences between the Chinese and British sides
were now very small. China-incorporated shares led the general rebound, with
buyers active throughout the day, and the H-share index rising 16.50, or
about 1.25 per cent to 1,353.78.
Champion Technology gained 20 cents to HKDollars 2.575 on hopes it can
benefit from a possible opening of China's telecommunications market.
SHANGHAI's A share index closed 78.56, or 10.75 per cent higher at 809.34 as
turnover climbed to 5.70 billion yuan.
The fund project was first proposed by China's securities authorities at the
end of July but was not mentioned again, triggering fears that Beijing might
have changed its mind.
The A share index lost around 40 per cent of its value in the three weeks
starting at the end of September.
SYDNEY closed slightly higher after the Reserve Bankof Australia raised its
official cash rate by a percentage point to 6.50 per cent, the All
Ordinaries index rising 2.8 to 2,037.4 in turnover of ADollars 348.4m.
Resource issues finished slightly higher but industrials, particularly banks
and financials, were steady. Golds had a stronger session after bullion gold
added to gains in New York on Friday.
MANILA featured a Petron rise of 7.2 per cent to 26 pesos after stock
dividend rumours, and the composite index rose 28.35 to 3,113.15.
Property issues remained upbeat - Filinvest Land rose 2.5 per cent to 10.25
pesos while Ayala Land B rose 1.3 per cent to 40 pesos.
SEOUL saw active institutional selling take the composite index down 7.75 to
1,081.55. The Seoul bridge collapse, which killed 32 people last week,
continued to depress construction stocks and the sub-index lost 11.58 at
567.43.
Kepco fell Won300 to Won32,300 ahead of a scheduled listing on Friday of its
ADRs on the New York stock exchange.
TAIPEI's weighted index fell 28.57 to 6,742.39 after late profit-taking

FT  25 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Rate rise lends support to Australian dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian dollar was yesterday firmer after the central bank's decision
to raise short term interest rates by 100 basis points, writes Philip
Gawith.
Although higher rates had been expected, the decision to lift cash rates to
6.5 per cent came earlier, and was larger, than the market had expected.
The Australian dollar closed in London at Dollars 0.7366 from Dollars 0.7316
on Friday. Traders said its inability to break through the Dollars 0.74
barrier left the Australian dollar vulnerable to a correction.
Elsewhere, the US dollar traded in a narrow range. It gained some support
from good German inflation data which renewed market speculation that the
Bundesbank council might lower German interest rates when it meets this
week. The dollar closed at DM1.497, from DM1.4954, and at Y97.215 from
Y96.995.
The sterling index was unchanged at 80.4. After a firmer start, with the
pound rising above DM2.44, it later lost ground to close at DM2.437, from DM
2.4345. Against the dollar it was unchanged at Dollars 1.628.
In Europe, the Swedish krona was the star performer on the back of a
successful bond auction. The krona finished at SKr4.748 against the D-Mark,
from SKr4.758.
The Australian dollar has risen from around Dollars 0.65 at the end of last
year to its present level, buoyed by rising commodity prices and the
prospect of higher interest rates. Some observers see this trend continuing,
but others believe a correction may be in order.
Mr Joe Prendergast, analyst at Paribas Capital Markets, commented: 'From
here, given that commodity prices may weaken, with the increasing focus on
the balance of payments, and the CPI out this week, I would not be surprised
if we saw the 'Ozzie' fall to Dollars 0.73 this week. It is not going
through the technical levels, so the market is looking to the downside in
the short term.'
The focus is on the release tomorrow of the second quarter CPI figures.
There is some concern that these figures will show why the RBA tightened
policy as much as it did. If these suggest that the RBA is playing
'catch-up' in combatting inflation, there is a risk of the 'Ozzie' going the
same way as the US dollar.
The broad market consensus is that the US dollar will remain weak until at
least some further tightening of monetary policy is seen. In the absence of
this, it remains vulnerable to a sell-off on the publication of strong
economic data. In this regard, both the employment cost index today, and the
durable goods orders tomorrow, will be closely watched.
Although the dollar remains very weak, it appears that the absence of
central bank intervention may actually have helped. Commenting on the
dollar's very narrow trading range, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at
the Bank of America in London, said: 'It may be more effective letting the
market worry about potential intervention than actually buying dollars
publicly.'
Mr Hawkins said he believed the market was also 'pretty short' of dollars
now, and this accounted for the slow trade, in the absence of new
information to trade on.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at Abn-Amro, said the loss of
liquidity in financial markets this year was another factor explaining the
subdued trading volumes. 'There are not that many big investors prepared to
take a bet and go with it,' he said.
The catalyst for the firmer krona was a successful bond auction which was
more than two times oversubscribed. Weakness in the bond market has
occasionally undermined the currency in recent months.
The Finnish markka ended at FM3.046 to the D-Mark, from FM3.0525. Dealers
reported the Bank of Finland had earlier bought small amounts of D-Mark for
markkas. Mr Prendergast commented: 'The Bank of Finland has in the past
month been on both sides of the market. The bank is not protesting against
particular levels of the markka; it is just seeking to calm some sharp
market moves.'
He said he was sceptical of whether the trend that has seen the markka rise
by 21.5 per cent against the dollar this year, could continue.
The overnight rate traded between 5 1/4 and 7 per cent as the Bank of
England provided UK money markets with Pounds 251m assistance - Pounds 175m
in the form of late assistance - after forecasting a Pounds 450m shortage.
Three month LIBOR was unchanged at 5 15/16 per cent.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (8): Black-out
fuels the debate - Case study, Enel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Southern Italians were reminded of their dependence on electricity one
morning at the end of August. The grid in central Italy had tripped,
blacking out the south for several hours. Trains were stuck between
stations, passengers trapped in lifts and, in the middle of a heat wave,
refrigerators ceased functioning. It is easy to understand why angry users
demanded that privatisation of the state electricity corporation, Enel,
should be speeded up.
At the same time, however, opponents of privatisation were quick to use the
black-out for justifying their position. They claimed that the absence of
state control over the electricity industry would lead to poorer service,
with higher risk of more and longer power cuts. While the black-out
seriously inconvenienced about 18m users, it did provide ammunition in the
privatisation debate.
Enel's reaction to the black-out and the relatively prompt return of the
grid has also been exploited by those prepared to accept privatisation
provided Enel is retained as a unified, vertically integrated electricity
corporation. They say that restoring supplies in southern Italy would have
been much harder with a fragmented industry.
Whether Enel should be split into separate production, transmission and
distribution companies, or left alone, has been an issue dividing
privatisers and partners of the governing coalition. Alleanza Nazionale (AN)
is firmly against break-up, partly because of its centralist and corporatist
fascist roots and partly because its electoral base is concentrated in the
south. If Enel were split, southern users might suffer in terms of poorer
service and higher tariffs.
Lega Nord has different ideas to its AN coalition partner. Favouring a
federal political structure, it is not surprising that it leads calls for
splitting Enel. Mr Vito Gnutti, Lega Nord industry minister, says that
selling Enel as a unified, vertically integrated utility would only create a
private sector monopoly.
Support for splitting Enel came in a document from the anti-trust authority
at the end of June. The authority considers that promotion of competition in
the electricity sector requires that Enel's privatisation should be directed
towards market liberalisation.
British experience should provide the guide, suggests the anti-trust
authority. It proposes: separating ownership and management of the
production, transmission and distribution phases; selling off production
plant; maintaining the single and centralised management of the transmission
system; and reorganising distribution on a regional basis with the creation
of separate companies.
Such proposals have met vigorous opposition from Enel's senior management.
They argue that a unified and vertically integrated structure offers
advantages of better plant co-ordination and security and service
guarantees, economies of scale in production, distribution economies,
negotiating muscle with international fuel suppliers and homogeneous tariff
structures.
Enel says that there is also financial advantage in privatising the
corporation as it stands. In a brief prepared for a hearing by a Senate
commission in September, the corporation's board noted that splitting Enel
would damage the image and credit rating that it presently enjoys in
international financial markets.
'The sale of shares in a large corporation like Enel, that is well known and
has good standing in national and international markets, would certainly be
more successful than stock market quotation of several smaller, and unknown,
companies derived from break-up.'
Break-up would need time, and would probably necessitate the appointment of
new management given the opposition expressed by Mr Franco Viezzoli,
chairman, and Mr Alfonso Limbruno, managing director. So if the government's
schedule for privatisation in the first half of next year is to be met, Enel
will have to be sold as it stands.
Enel became a joint stock corporation in July 1992 and London merchant bank
Kleinwort Benson was appointed the Treasury's advisers on privatisation in
August last year. There has since been continuous co-operation aimed at
preparing Enel for stock market quotation, the corporation's officers told
the Senate commission. Indeed, Enel is ready for the market.
'Preparatory measures for share quotation that are Enel's responsibility
have been completed. Kleinwort Benson's work is finished. Other measures
that need to be taken are those connected with the quotation which can only
be commenced when the quotation itself is decided,' the commission was
informed.
Two crucial political decisions have been under discussion for some time.
These are the stipulation of an operating concession and the establishment
of a regulatory authority for the electricity industry.
The operating concession has been a controversial issue since reports that
it would give Enel a 99-year deal. Free marketeers, municipal utilities and
vehicle producers reacted immediately. So did the anti-trust authority,
which suggested that the concession's duration should be 20 years. The
anti-trust authority recommended: 'The concession should indicate clearly
and unequivocally that there should be no guarantee of economic
indemnification in the event that exclusive rights should be removed as a
result of changes in national or Community law.'
The concession is a critical piece in the privatisation puzzle, shaping the
structure of Italy's electricity industry through the conditions it
establishes and the roles that it defines for a privatised Enel and other
operators.
With enactment of legislation at the end of July, establishment of the
regulatory authority became critical. The law requires that sale of state
shareholdings in energy companies must be subordinate to the creation of an
independent body for regulating tariffs and overseeing service quality. Enel
cannot be privatised until there is a regulatory authority.
With the coalition parties haggling over the number of its members, and with
uncertainty about its role and that of the industry ministry in tariff
setting, establishing the regulatory authority has not been straightforward.
At least Enel's financial indebtedness, often described as needing attention
before privatisation, is no longer considered an obstacle. Medium and
long-term debt was L34,504bn at the end of last year and the net short-term
bank position showed borrowings of L2,003bn on net equity of L20,000bn.
However, net indebtedness fell by L1,448bn in the first half this year, with
internally generated finance increasing to L5,235bn from L4,005bn in
first-half 1993.
Profits have also improved. The post-tax result was L344bn last year, 47 per
cent up on 1992. Enel's board considers that the operating margin in the
first half, 29 per cent higher than last year, and continuing
rationalisation allow expectations of a full-year outturn better than 1993.
Potential investors will be looking closely at profits and will want to see
further substantial increases. Despite the improvement, last year's result
would have been insufficient for satisfactory shareholder remuneration.
Says Mr Paolo Azzoni of Milan securities house Gamba &amp; Azzoni, the Paribas
Capital Markets subsidiary: 'As an electricity utility, investors will be
looking for dividends from Enel. Profit is crucial.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (7): Rolling back
the boundaries of the state - Privatisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation will contribute to creating an economic democracy that is more
solid and, above all, free from political abuse,' Mr Carlo Azeglo Ciampi
wrote at the end of last year in a pamphlet explaining the benefits of
selling state assets.
Mr Ciampi, who headed the government between April 1993 and May this year,
had been a firm privatisation supporter when governor of the Bank of Italy.
'The nature and size of the public sector's presence in the economy need to
be changed drastically,' he told the central bank's annual meeting in May
1991.
Mr Ciampi noted that the sale of public assets is not simply a means of
resolving the problem of debt and debt servicing. He said: 'Disposals must
relieve the state of the burden of activities that are not its proper
concern.'
When Mr Ciampi became prime minister, the process of shedding this burden
had already been started by Mr Giuliano Amato, his predecessor. A decree
issued by Mr Amato's government in July 1992 was the first serious step in
rolling back the boundaries of the state, which in Italy had encroached
deeply into many areas of the economy.
The highly diversified business empire that Mr Amato's government inherited
included ice cream and confectionery making, hotels, bars and supermarkets,
as well as machinery manufacture, chemicals, steelmaking, banking and
insurance.
The decree transformed the large holding corporations, IRI and ENI, the
electricity corporation Enel, and the state insurer INA into joint stock
corporations, with share capital owned by the Treasury. Transformation
brought the state corporations into line with the form of private sector
companies.
Under pressure to demonstrate privatising credentials, from financial
markets that had watched the lira's enforced exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism, Mr Amato did not wait long. Two months after the decree, in
mid-September 1992, he announced that the controlling interests of IRI in
Credito Italiano and ENI in turbine and pump maker Nuovo Pignone would be
sold. Italian privatisation was under way.
Since then there have been numerous plans, programmes, administrative and
legislative steps, formal opinions and directives dealing with
privatisation. Conference organisers have been kept busy. Volumes have been
written and spoken.
What results have been achieved since September 1992? On the financial side,
the figures show that IRI has received a little over L6,000bn from disposals
of shareholdings and ENI about L3,200bn. In addition, the Treasury has
received about L7,000bn from sales of shareholdings owned directly.
Although he got privatisation underway, Mr Amato was no longer prime
minister when the first important operation was completed. Mr Ciampi's
government oversaw the transfer of Credito Italiano from IRI to wider
ownership last December. Investor enthusiasm was such that the operation, in
which IRI sold its 64 per cent stake of ordinary stock, was more than eight
times over-subscribed.
The public offering in Credito Italiano, a bank already enjoying stock
market quotation, was quickly followed by the initial public offer of shares
in IMI, the Rome banking and financial services group. In this operation,
also heavily over-subscribed, the Treasury halved its direct and indirect
stake of 59 per cent. IRI's Banca Commerciale Italiana completed last
winter's trio of banking privatisations when the state holding corporation
sold its 54 per cent interest at the end of February.
This spring brought a pause in privatisation operations of interest to the
general public. It was broken by the first privatisation under Silvio
Berlusconi's right-wing government, which also made its mark as Italy's
biggest privatisation so far. At the end of June, the Treasury sold 53 per
cent of wholly-owned INA, thereby raising L4,800bn.
Italian privatisations that have created, or broadened, wide share ownership
amount to just four. All are financial institutions and the shares of two
were already well-known and traded on the stock market before the share
offerings were made. Progress might be described as modest.
Mr Pietro Ciucci, IRI's finance manager, says, however, that the achievement
of disposing of large shareholdings in two leading banks in a period of only
three months should not be underestimated. 'The timetable was tight. There
was a lot of scepticism. Only with the benefit of hindsight can we say it
was easy,' commented Mr Ciucci.
He rejects suggestions that IRI has been slow in privatising its industrial
activities. Three trade sale operations have been completed over the past
two years. Break-up of the SME food and retailing group has allowed IRI to
dispose of two divisions. The Italgel ice cream, frozen food and
confectionery business was bought by Nestle in August 1993 for L437bn and
the Cirio Bertolli De Rica canned vegetables and olive oil business was sold
two months later for L311bn.
Mr Ciucci is pleased at the out-turn of SME's break-up. He expects that
revenues from the sale of the final division, GS-Autogrill food retailing
and motorway catering, will be banked by the end of the year. 'The break-up
will have allowed IRI to obtain a higher price per share than SME's shares
ever reached.'
IRI's finance manager also hopes that the sale of the Ilva Laminati Piani
steel company will be completed before year-end, thereby registering a
second successful withdrawal from steel in six months. The corporation's
third industrial trade sale in the past two years was the disposal of Acciai
Speciali Terni special steels for L600bn in July.
Trade sales have predominated so far in privatisations at the ENI
hydrocarbons holding. The principal operation was the disposal of Nuovo
Pignone to the US General Electric for L1,100bn, finalised last December.
ENI has completed about 60 sales in the past two years. Its Enirisorse
sub-holding has shed coal activities in the US and South Africa, as well as
copper alloy tubes and secondary aluminium businesses in Italy. The Agip oil
subsidiary has sold minority stakes in fields in the US and rights in the
North Sea, while the downstream Agip Petroli subsidiary has sold liquefied
gas distribution activities in Italy and its Argentinian operations.
The Agip hotel-motel chain was an early operation in a deal with the UK's
Forte group. In concentrating on its core businesses, ENI has also sold
textile machinery makers Matec and Cognetex and a manufacturer of domestic
gas heating systems, Caldaie Murali a Gas.
Many of Enichem's chemicals activities have been identified as non-core and
sold or put up for sale as a result of corporate restructuring. Businesses
making rubber and latex synthetics, additives for plastics and auxiliaries
for rubber have been sold. So also has the Isagro agricultural
pharmaceuticals and seeds subsidiary, in a management buy-out.
Trade sales do not contribute to stimulating the stock market or broadening
the shareholder base, however. Some 2 1/2 years ago Mr Ciampi said:
'Privatisation of public sector companies will strengthen the market and
spread share ownership among savers and institutional investors.' So far,
ENI's privatisation operations have done nothing to encourage wider
shareholdings.
ENI does, however, control a group of companies that are among Italy's most
attractive privatisation candidates: Agip (upstream oil and gas), Agip
Petroli refining and distribution, and Snam gas trading, transport and
distribution. While it is planned that these will be offered to the public,
there is disagreement over how they should be offered.
Should they be presented as an energy conglomerate, the SuperAgip solution,
in a package that would also include the Saipem drilling and pipeline laying
business and the Snamprogetti engineering company? Or should they be quoted
and sold separately?
A plan prepared two years ago proposed that ENI itself should be quoted and
sold, after disposal of non-core activities such as Nuovo Pignone, coal,
media interests and chemicals. Subsequently the Amato government instructed
ENI to present plans for the stock market quotation of Snam, Agip and other
candidates for listing, with March 31 1993 as the deadline for completing
the task.
With the fall of the Amato government, the problem was faced by Mr Ciampi's
administration. A directive issued at the beginning of July 1993 required
that procedures for selling Agip should be got underway within 30 days.
Mr Franco Bernabe', managing director, says that the corporation awaits
instructions from the government. Stockbrokers and merchant bankers are not
unanimous about how to maximise revenues. Politicians are divided. But
whatever the decision, the initial public offering of shares in ENI's energy
companies will be an important event for investors, in Italy and outside.
So also will be IRI's offering of shares in its quoted telecommunications
sub-holding, Stet. As with ENI's energy business, the Stet offering is
contentious, with politicians, bankers and industrialists elbowing for
advantage. There is more than IRI's L12,000bn interest at stake.
Although there are further INA and IMI tranches to come, and Mr Mario
Sarcinelli, the new chairman of Treasury-controlled Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, hopes for privatisation within two years, attention is now focused
on Italy's infrastructure and industrial privatisations.
IRI expects to make an offering of shares in quoted Autostrade, the motorway
operator, next year, as well as an initial public offering of shares in
Aeroporti di Roma, the Rome airport company. Much more time will be needed
to sort out struggling Alitalia, the quoted state airline in which IRI has a
90 per cent stake. 'On Alitalia we will need a convincing story for the
market,' remarked Mr Ciucci.
Privatisation has been slow. Restrictive conditions on sales, aimed at job
preservation, and a deeply ingrained anti-market mentality among many staff
whose companies are threatened by privatisation have not helped.
On a political level, continuity and unity of purpose have been lacking.
Disagreements in the Berlusconi government do little to encourage
expectations that a coherent, determined and all-embracing programme will be
implemented rapidly.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (6): Years of
painful negotiation - The steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When European Union industry ministers agreed last December on a package of
aid and capacity cuts for Europe's subsidised steel companies it looked like
years of painful negotiation, in which the Italian authorities had played a
leading role, had come to an end.
In Brussels, Italy - and in particular the heavily subsidised state-owned
producer, Ilva - had been painted as the villain of the piece, accused of
prevarication, stubborn refusal to reduce capacity and, at one point, of
having deliberately concealed a blast furnace from European Commission
inspectors.
Rival producers warned they would be unable to subscribe to the EU plan to
reduce capacity and rescue the whole European industry from a slump in
demand, if the Italians did not fall into line.
But Mr Paolo Savona, then Italy's industry minister, managed to win what
looked at the time like a surprisingly good deal from his European
counterparts. This envisaged a reduction of 2m tonnes in overall steel
production in Italy. Under the original calculations, some 1.2m tonnes of
capacity would be lost at Ilva's Taranto plant in southern Italy; 500,000
tonnes at plants owned by the eventual buyer of the Taranto flat products
division; and a further 300,000 was accounted for by the dismantling of
Ilva's Bagnoli plant, a hot rolled steel mill which was already lying
dormant.
Strict Commission surveillance was supposed to ensure that the terms of the
package were observed. The Commission was particularly pleased with Rome's
commitment to privatise Ilva by the end of 1994, meaning that the Ecu2.6bn
subsidy allowed under the December agreement would be the last state aid for
Ilva. Mr Savona estimated that the break-up and sale of Ilva could raise
some L4,100bn for the state.
Part of the privatisation process has already been completed, most notably
with the sale of the more attractive special steels division of Ilva -
Acciai Speciali Terni (AST) - at the end of June, bought by a German-Italian
consortium for L600bn.
But with the December deadline fast approaching the most important part of
the Ilva privatisation - the sale of the flat products division, Ilva
Laminati Piani (ILP), centred on Taranto - has yet to be carried out.
Mr Vito Gnutti, who has been industry minister since Mr Silvio Berlusconi's
government took office in May, is still confident that a sale will be made,
but he admits that the pressure is increasing. 'It's clear that if there is
only one buyer, and he knows we have to sell before December 31, this buyer
will hold on until December hoping to put pressure on the seller,' he says.
Other observers are even more pessimistic about the prospects for ILP. Mr
Hayao Nakamura is the former representative of Nippon Steel in Italy, who
took over as chief executive of Ilva in February last year. He inherited an
extraordinary range of problems - debt was at the same level as turnover,
for example, with interest rates at 13.5 per cent - and believes that the
Italian state-owned steel industry was badly treated by Brussels.
'We're closing the Bagnoli hot steel mill - the latest hot steel mill
constructed in Europe. From the point of view of rationalisation in Europe
we should be closing the older ones, but Italy is closing the newest, which
was built at a cost of L1,000bn,' points out Mr Nakamura, now an adviser to
what remains of Ilva. He adds that Italy is having to import more than 50
per cent of its flat products from Germany and France, two of the countries
which pressed hard for Italy to close down capacity.
Mr Nakamura is also sceptical about the feasibility of offers made so far
for the ILP division. G William Miller, the US merchant bank, is supposed to
be linking up with a consortium of steelmakers and local enterprises in one
offer, while Lucchini, the private Italian steel producer, is also said to
be interested. Recent reports suggest that Riva, another private producer
which was also part of the victorious consortium to buy AST, has come under
pressure to join the bidding.
But Mr Nakamura believes there is a risk that these offers will be too low,
or based on the future sale of attractive parts of the business, and closure
of the rest - an option which would lead to further job losses in some of
Italy's most depressed regions. Mr Gnutti says, however, that strict
conditions will be imposed on any buyers, preventing them from simply
stripping the best ILP assets.
Further job losses in the industry would only add to the suffering of the
past few years of restructuring. In 1987, for example, Finsider, the state
steelmaker which was Ilva's predecessor, produced a job reduction plan which
would cut the workforce from 79,000 to about 55,000 in three years.
Subsequently, some jobs have been transferred to the private sector, but Mr
Nakamura believes that ILP will have to cut its workforce by a further
10,000 or more to 18,000 before 1996.
There is perhaps even greater concern in Italy's private steel industry,
which is also the subject of EU plans for capacity reduction.
In June, the Commission agreed to allow capacity cuts of 5m and 6m tonnes in
the so-called 'Bresciani' mills in northern Italy, backed by state aid, even
though some of the cuts will be achieved through partial closure of plants
rather than a complete shutdown as required under a strict interpretation of
EU rules. The cuts are considered vital to the success of the EU's plan for
overall capacity reductions in the European industry.
The industry federation, Federacciai, has estimated that more than a quarter
of the 25,000 jobs in the private sector would be lost as a result of the
capacity cuts. More than 80 separate plans for closure have been submitted,
and a formal decree has been passed by the Italian government, but the
process of capacity reduction has not yet got under way. Mr Gnutti, himself
a native of Brescia, is likely to discuss the detail of the plan with fellow
EU industry ministers in Brussels next month.
Unfortunately for these fragmented Italian companies, there is no sign of
the improvement in demand which has made larger competitors - for example,
in Germany - wonder aloud whether there is any longer a need for an EU-wide
steel industry rescue plan. Mr Enrico Badiali, director of Federacciai, says
demand, particularly among clients in the Italian building sector, has yet
to pick up. 'There are still problems for those private companies which are
committed to closure,' he says.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (4): Remarkable
resilience - Prato textile industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting round the table with the leading representatives of the Prato
textile industry, one can feel a palpable sense of relief. The worst of the
recession is behind.
Prato has come through a long, lean patch, beginning with a brutally
enforced structural adjustment of the industry in the mid-1980s, which was
then capped by recession - first in the main markets abroad and then at
home. The experience has proved the remarkable resilience and adaptability
of the 8,500 companies in the Prato area near Florence.
This is the single biggest agglomeration of textile manufacturing facilities
in Europe with a turnover close to L6,500bn (including textile machinery).
The health of Prato is an important symbol of the way Italy's myriad small
and medium-sized companies can cope with fast-changing industrial
conditions.
'The secret of our survival and success is above all owed to our enormous
flexibility,' says Mr Lamberto Cecchi, chairman of the Prato Industrialists
Union, the co-ordinating body for the local textile business. 'We also rely
on the speed of our responses; our closeness to clients; the high degree of
specialisation among our own companies, plus our permanent search for
innovation,' he adds.
Mr Cecchi and his colleagues speak with infectious self-confidence about
their ability to face challenges. The business is in their blood with a
tradition of cloth production that dates back to the 12th century. But all
this does not conceal the traumatic upheavals caused by a combination of
increased third country competition and recession in the main markets.
Over the past 15 years employment has fallen by one third, the worst
casualties being in the 'artisan' sector - very small companies with limited
technology and where the workforce is non-unionised. On average, some 550
companies disappeared every year during the 1980s. The sector now employs
42,000 people of whom 33,000 are directly linked to textile production that
covers wool, cloth, linen, silks and knitwear.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign is precisely on the employment front. 'We
think at last that employment has stabilised, and there could even be a
slight upswing ahead,' says Mr Cecchi.
According to the Industrial Union's research department, the recovery can be
traced back to latter part of 1992. In 1993, the value of production grew 11
per cent, while exports increased 20 per cent to L4,100bn. However, only in
the past six months has the recovery extended across the board. Exports are
up 24 per cent on the same period in 1993.
Prato caters essentially to the fashion business, and mainly at
the-ready-to-wear end. This involves ephemeral tastes in fabrics and the
constant search for something new, the latest being washed silk. In any one
year, Prato companies turn out 70,000 different materials. These are usually
small runs in specialised market niches.
'We cannot now compete with countries like China - nor do we try - in
producing large quantities of cloth. Our competitive edge comes in our being
able to find new combinations of materials, of understanding and
anticipating what the fashion designers might want,' says Mr Cecchi.
But the real strength of what is often called 'the Prato system' is more
complex. Within a relatively compact geographical area, a complete
integrated industry has grown up in a dynamic but organic way. Thousands of
mostly small family companies exist side-by-side, each specialising in one
particular activity - whether it be special dyeing facilities, techniques of
blending artificial fibres or packaging machinery. Facilities such as
industrial water recycling are shared and backed by a sympathetic local
council.
Though competing, these companies also exchange ideas and frequently turn to
each other to help with orders.
During the difficult years, a few of the medium-sized groups bought up
rivals or sought to establish more integrated operations. But integrated
operations covering several aspects of textile production are still rare.
Takeovers are complicated and the tax legislation remains punitive on
mergers.
'In Prato, the companies are people; their energy and their ideas. You risk
getting a factory shell if you buy a company. . . and it wouldn't be easy
for an outsider to buy in. The Japanese tried and withdrew perplexed several
years ago,' observed Mr Roberto Cenni who runs Gomtex, one of the bigger
companies in Prato.
Another tendency has been for companies to reduce their operational size.
This was motivated both by the need to cut costs and to reduce the hold of
the unions over work practices.
A company employing fewer than 15 people, for example, manages to avoid
nearly all the tough norms imposed by the Ministry of Labour. Once a company
employs more than 25 people, it has to begin recruiting 10 per cent from the
handicapped.
According to the latest figures, 47 per cent of all companies employ fewer
than 10 people, while a further 40 per cent employ fewer than 50 people.
Less than 4 per cent of the textile workforce is employed in companies with
more than 100 people on the payroll. And two thirds of Prato companies are
still classified as 'artisan'.
The businesses that have survived have investing heavily in new machinery
and R&amp;D. Many factories have been completely re-equipped during the past
five years. Roughly 5 per cent of Prato's turnover is devoted to research
and development.
Coupled with this upgrading, the Prato producers established closer ties
with their markets, ensuring they offered the right kind of product. In the
fast-moving ready-to-wear business, product lines are short. This accounts
for Prato's enormous flexibility - but it also means that the companies face
extra costs in frequently setting up new production lines.
To narrow the gap with customers, Prato has begun to move away from a rigid
two-season production for winter and summer - with consequent irregularities
in the rhythm of production. Instead, Prato now offers two mid-season ranges
which are a refining or a 'second edition' of what has already been produced
for the start of the winter-summer range.
The manufacturers are concerned that the recovery will push up raw material
costs. Already this year, cotton, wool and linen prices have risen almost 15
per cent. In the first six months of the year, a combination of greater
demand and higher prices saw the cost of imported raw materials and
semi-finished goods increase from L338bn to L653bn.
As companies come to terms with the recovery, they will have to focus more
on the problems created by their under-capitalisation. The capital structure
of the majority of companies is weak, companies are underfunded and
accounting procedures are particularly poor among the smaller businesses.
The other problem worrying the managers is that of labour. Skilled workers
with a priceless knowledge stretching back over three decades are beginning
to retire and it is hard to find replacements.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (2): Restructuring
and innovation - Lessons from the recession / Half-year results from Italy's
industrial giants provided the first clear signals of a recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first six months of 1994 certainly marked a political turning point for
Italy, but they were also significant for Italy's big industrial companies.
After two to three years struggling against a global recession, a costly and
inflexible labour market, an overvalued currency and, in certain cases,
endemic corruption, Italian industry is returning to profit.
The recent crop of half-year results from Italy's industrial giants provided
the first clear signals of a recovery, as already hinted by official
statistics and trumpeted by the new, ostensibly pro-business government of
Mr Silvio Berlusconi.
Montedison, the energy, chemical and agro-industrial company which perhaps
more than any other enterprise has symbolised the recent trend in Italian
industry, was the first of the large quoted companies to report half-year
results. The group, brought to its knees last year by alleged mismanagement
and corruption, returned to pre-tax profits for the first time since 1991.
Its parent, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), also reported a return to the
black.
Another symbol, Fiat, the industrial and automotive group, revealed a profit
before tax of L727bn for the first six months, compared with interim losses
in the equivalent period of L982bn before tax; the first sign of the scale
of the convulsion which the automotive market was suffering. Mr Gianni
Agnelli forecast that the group's record losses of 1993 could be converted
into a gross consolidated profit for 1994 of as much as Dollars 1bn.
Pirelli, the cables and tyres group, also returned to the black in the first
half, and although Olivetti, the computer manufacturer, disappointed
investors with extraordinary losses on its investment portfolio, it cut its
first-half operating loss to only L6.2bn and said it was still on course to
break even at operating level for the full year, after three years in the
red.
The large industrial companies have finally begun to benefit from the
momentous changes in their operating environment instituted over the past
two years.
In particular, the September 1992 devaluation of the lira and the loosening
of a rigid labour market have begun to have an impact on group results.
Protected by a weak currency, Fiat, for example, managed to increase its
exports and push up its share of the depressed Italian market by 1.3
percentage points to 46 per cent in the first half. Marzotto, Italy's
largest textile manufacturer which makes 62 per cent of its sales outside
its home market, forecast a 'considerable increase' in full-year profits as
it finally began to benefit from the devaluation.
Most entrepreneurs believe the lira is now slightly undervalued, but they
dismiss accusations that for the past two years they have been operating at
an unfair advantage compared with European and international competitors.
Mr Gian Carlo Vaccari, chief executive of Sasib, the railway equipment and
machinery manufacturer which is part of Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir group,
says: 'In the 1980s we had to operate with a loss of competitivity - fixed
exchange rates and an increasing cost of labour. Now the lira has returned
to its true value.'
But it would be wrong to assume that Italian industry has waited passively
for a change in the economic environment. Analysts agree that most large
Italian companies have worked hard to cut costs and restructure.
Olivetti, for example, which has had to cope with the special pressures on
the world computer market, had some 59,000 employees in 1989, and expects to
have reduced this number to 33,000 by the middle of next year. That is a net
decrease, but the company has also taken on staff from outside to introduce
new blood into the group as it seeks to manoeuvre itself into the related
areas of multimedia and telecommunications.
Fiat has cut staff from 300,000 in 1990, to 260,000 in 1993; Pirelli from
50,000 to 40,000 in the past two years.
All three companies have also attacked costs, and pursued innovation.
Analysts were impressed by Olivetti's claim at the half-year stage to have
reduced sales, general and administrative costs from 28 per cent in 1992, to
20.5 per cent. The target is to reach 18 per cent in 1995.
Fiat, meanwhile, is 'outsourcing' some of its automotive business and has
just decided to merge Magneti Marelli and Gilardini, its two automotive
components subsidiaries, as rationalisation continues.
Fiat Auto, the main subsidiary, is half way through the programme of
renewing its range, beginning last year with the successful Fiat Punto.
Pirelli is laying the emphasis on new cables, using high technology fibre
optics, for the multimedia market, and has increased the pace of new product
development in both the cable and tyre divisions.
Ferruzzi-Montedison's restructuring has been more hectic, as it has picked
itself up following last year's near-collapse. In his letter to shareholders
earlier this year, Mr Guido Rossi, chairman of both Ferfin and Montedison,
described the rescue plan instituted with the co-operation of the banks as
'the largest out-of-court financial restructuring in history, in terms of
the scale of the indebtedness rescheduled, its geographic dimensions and the
number of parties involved'.
But even under pressure, Montedison has managed to raise L1,100bn since last
year by selling off non-core businesses while Ferfin has cut its debt in the
first half by nearly 30 per cent.
It has not been an easy task: the Ferruzzi-Montedison structure contains
some 1,800 different companies, many dormant investment vehicles set up by
the now discredited previous management which must be ditched or wound up.
It would be unwise, however, to overstate the strength of Italian industry,
and particularly the big companies, at this early stage in the recovery.
Restructuring of Italy's public sector, through privatisation, has slowed
down under the Berlusconi government, particularly in industrial sectors
such as telecoms (Stet), energy and chemicals (Eni), and electricity (Enel).
This is not only a disappointment to analysts, but could prove a handicap if
these companies want to take advantage of the improved climate to make
international alliances.
And once they have shaken off recession, rinsed out the bad taste left by
corruption, and completed the process of restructuring, international
competition is still intense for Italian companies already in the private
sector. They are not the only industrial companies to have undergone
substantial restructuring during the downturn. In addition, they are still
underweight compared with companies from other similar sized and even
smaller economies.
Generali, the Italian insurer, is the only Italian group to make it into the
list of the world's 100 largest public companies.
This need not matter for the overall Italian economy, which draws strength
from the performance of its small and medium-sized enterprises, often
family-owned, but it must worry the bigger Italian players.
It would be better to conclude, then, with a note of caution struck by the
director-general of Fiat, Mr Giorgio Garuzzo. Asked if there was a risk of
complacency setting in at Fiat as the economic situation improved, he
replied: 'I think we're still a long way away from that.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (3): Pragmatism
may prevail - Robert Graham examines labour relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian trades union movement finds itself increasingly in the role of
chief opponent of the Berlusconi government's economic and financial policy.
The general strike called on October 14 to protest against cuts in pensions
and the general content of the 1995 budget, could mark a turning point in
relations between the government and the unions. Unless the trades union
leadership sees the government willing to make some concessions on pensions
and health service cuts, street protest is likely to continue.
There could be a spill-over effect on relations between the unions and the
employers. This then risks undermining one of the most remarkable
achievements of recent years - the July 1993 tripartite agreement between
the government, unions and employers that ended wage indexation (the
pernicious scala mobile) and linked wage rises to productivity.
Pragmatism may well prevail; but such a scenario is disturbing
industrialists who had hoped to be able to rely on stable industrial
relations as a central building block of the economic recovery.
Since 1992, the level of industrial unrest has been decreasing. The three
main trades union confederations have preferred negotiation to
confrontation. The number of hours lost through strikes in the first half of
this year was a 25-year low.
In part this reflects a decline in the influence of the unions and lower
membership. Perhaps more importantly the traditional bastions of trades
union power - the workforce in the big engineering-manufacturing groups -
have been weakened by job losses in the industrial restructuring of the past
five years.
As a consequence, job security has been put before pay rises, or even work
conditions, as the unions recognise that some of the privileges they have
acquired over the years will have to go. It was significant that the
engineering workers broke with their confrontational tradition and agreed to
renew their national contract in July without even a token protest strike.
The wage element has been the simplest aspect of negotiations in the past
two years. Since 1992, wages have declined in real terms. Last year, wages
on average rose 3 per cent, a good percentage point below inflation (with
public sector pay rising marginally behind the private sector). This year,
there has been no suggestion that wage levels will be able to recover lost
earning power. Indeed, with inflation slightly higher than projected in the
official figures, the decline in real earnings will continue.
The huge improvement in the climate of industrial relations, at least until
this autumn, has undoubtedly been helped by the 1993 tripartite agreement.
The agreement ended the old system whereby wages in the private sector were
based upon three elements - an agreed industry-wide rate, specific company
related payments and an indexation payment. Now, nominal wages are
renegotiated every two years within a four-year nationwide framework. The
increases in pay cannot exceed projected inflation, while company payments
above the norm must be linked to productivity.
Beyond this, the government is committed to stimulate spending on research
and development, improve job training and address the problems of industry
in depressed areas. In conjunction, the unions accepted that further reforms
were necessary in the labour market, including the need to tackle the issue
of temporary employment.
The unions feel they have played their part in terms of job sacrifices and
wage restraint. They are now awaiting the government to deliver on its part
of the bargain. However, they suspect the government is far more interested
in first securing a greater liberalisation of the labour market - as are the
employers.
The Berlusconi government made the first, albeit timid, steps to liberalise
the labour market in July. The measures introduce the principle of temporary
employment but then circumscribe it with a series of rules. For example,
employers can only resort to temporary work contracts where jobs are being
added to the company payroll - but not in substitution of existing jobs or
where jobs have already been shed.
Companies are also limited in the number of temporary employees. At the same
time, temporary employment cannot last longer than 12 months. As a
corollary, companies were also given tax breaks for hiring either long-time
unemployed or new job-seekers.
This falls short of an easy hire-and-fire policy, and does not address many
of the employers' complaints of the high non-wage cost of employment.
Nevertheless, an environment is emerging in which more flexible rules can be
applied to employment. As a result, there should be a gradual change in the
structure of employment, reducing the unacceptably high levels of youth
unemployment and the high degree of exclusion of women from formal jobs.
Female unemployment at 17 per cent is almost double the average for males
and the gap is even wider in the south.
Another anomaly being eroded is the national minimum wage applied regardless
of the differing conditions in the north and south. This has been a big
disincentive to investors, reluctant to pay the same wages in the south
where productivity has been historically lower and the cost of elements such
as housing are well below those in the north.
The north-south wage differential is now being encouraged indirectly by the
European Union. Brussels is forcing Italy to stop fiscal rebates on the wage
and social security bills of companies operating in the south - breaks which
allowed wages to be roughly the same nationwide.
Against this background - with reform of the labour market half complete and
wage agreements based on a finely-balanced sense of give-and-take between
the government, employers and the unions - it suits neither side to provoke
a 'hot autumn'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (1): Dynamism
versus deadweight - There is a remarkable contradiction between the strength
of the 'real' economy and the difficulties caused by political instability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian cartoonists invariably have the sharpest eye for summing up what is
going on.
A recent newspaper cartoon depicted a businessman scratching his head.
Behind him a smoking factory, humanised with face, arms and legs, is running
at full speed. The man comments: 'If everything is going so well, why is
everything going so badly?'
This pinpoints a remarkable apparent contradiction between the strength of
the 'real' economy and the continuing difficulties caused by political
instability and the weakness of Italy's public finances: the dynamism, on
the one hand, of private initiative and the resilience of the thousands of
small companies that are the lifeblood of Italian industry - and, on the
other, the continued deadweight of the public sector and the burden of debt
that has reached 125 per cent of gross domestic product.
The industrial recovery is now well under way after three bleak years. Order
books are swelling, utilisation of capacity is increasing, energy
consumption is up and profits are returning. The big private industrial
groups such as Fiat and Pirelli, which have gone through painful and costly
restructuring programmes, are signalling that the worst is over.
'The recovery is very strong and everywhere one goes there is a tremendous
sense of confidence among industrialists,' says Mr Stefano Miscossi, head of
research at Confindustria, the industrialists' association. He is shortly to
take over the directorate of industry in the Brussels Commission.
The converse of this picture is the serious weakness of the Berlusconi
government and the high interest rates which are needed to attract buyers of
Italian debt. Industrialists thus lack a stable political and financial
environment in which to plan investments.
Despite these negative considerations, Confindustria is convinced that
official GDP growth projections of 2.7 per cent in 1995 are too
conservative. Figures released earlier this month showed that the economy
had grown 2.3 per cent during the second quarter compared with the same
period last year.
Industrial activity in the period to the end of July had registered 12
consecutive months of growth. It is up 6.4 per cent on July 1993. Order
books initially lagged behind the growth in production but have begun to
pick up more quickly. Industrial orders increased almost 16 per cent in the
12 months ending July this year.
Export orders have provided the drive behind the growth in production. The
export element in industrial turnover was up 12 per cent in the year to the
end of July, compared with 4.2 per cent in the case of the domestic market.
And although exports were undoubtedly given a big boost by the September
1992 devaluation of the lira, the exchange rate is by no means the sole
explanation for the extraordinary success of Italian exports over the past
two years.
In this context, it is significant that Italian exports have increased at
more than twice the rate of Britain's even though both countries devalued at
the same time and by a similar amount.
Those who gained most from the devaluation have been large-scale industries
such as chemicals and steel, as well as the vehicle industry. But in
general, the commerce ministry claims that Italian companies are winning
orders because they have pruned their production costs and raised
productivity through shedding labour and by investment in new plant.
Since 1992, wages have been rising more slowly than inflation and last year
in large industrial groups the rise was less than 2 per cent - half the rate
of inflation.
Just as importantly in ensuring costs are competitive, Italian companies are
providing quality products with good customer service. This has been
especially true in the highly competitive emerging market of China where
Italian machine tools and engineering products have done well against tough
competition. More generally, Italian companies have benefited from the
strength of emerging economies in Asia and Latin America. Here too,
traditional industries such as shoe-making, textiles, clothing and leather
goods have done well.
Without their exports, the clothing and leather goods industries would have
fared far more badly in the domestic recession. Indeed, there have been
cases of factories switching their export orientation from 40 per cent to 80
per cent of total production. However, the balance is beginning to be
redressed.
In the 12 months to July, domestic orders increased by 17.6 per cent and
stronger domestic demand is clearly in evidence both for capital goods and
consumer items.
There are still considerable variations within individual sectors. The
vehicle industry has picked up strongly, thanks in good measure to an
enthusiastic response to Fiat's new Punto saloon produced at the greenfield
Melfi plant in southern Italy. At the weaker end is the foodstuffs industry
which remains stagnant, reflecting a combination of intense competition and
cutbacks in domestic household spending.
The construction sector is in worst shape. As a result of the recession and
the effects of corruption scandals, the construction business and the market
for construction equipment and materials has been deeply depressed.
Construction activity fell by almost one third in 1993.
The Berlusconi government revoked a freeze on public works contracts,
imposed in late 1992 to prevent bribes, pending the framing of new tendering
rules. The effects of the new government's move should begin to be felt in
the final quarter.
The problem areas of industry now tend to be those where the state still
continues to play an important role - chemicals, defence industries, mining,
steel and ship-building. ENI, the state oil concern, has being carrying out
a costly restructuring of its chemicals and fertiliser operations. The main
financial cost is over but rationalisation of some plant in the south still
has to be carried out.
Defence industries, badly affected by three years of reduced sales and high
costs, look likely to be a big casualty of cuts in the 1995 budget. As much
as L1,000bn has been taken out of planned spending and 1995 investments will
be L3,100bn against L3,340bn this year. This cutback could affect the merger
between the defence interests of Efim, the state holding in liquidation, and
Finmeccanica, the state-run defence and high-technology group.
Finmeccanica agreed to take on the defence side of Efim, provided the
government guaranteed orders from the armed services to sustain production
lines. At the same time Fincantieri, the ship-building subsidiary of IRI,
the state holding company, could lose one of its two remaining naval
shipyards as a result of the cuts.
In the case of steel, the saga of the break-up of Ilva, the state steel
company, is not fully resolved. Although the government is committed to
complete privatisation of Ilva by the end of the year, the fate of the huge
flat products factory in Taranto is not clear. Nor is it certain that Italy
will comply with European Union agreements on cuts in overall steel
production capacity, especially as demand is picking up.
The Berlusconi government is committed to continue the retreat of the state
from its dominant economic role. But the process is extremely complex and
politically sensitive since the state apparatus has long been a source of
patronage and jobs, especially in the south.
The termination of state subsidies to industry has forced the pace of the
privatisation process but IRI, the giant state holding company which still
controls more than 3 per cent of GDP, has yet to define its future role. It
could wind itself up as its assets are divested. Alternatively, it could
become the instrument of continued state influence through minority
ownership and 'golden share' control.
Some members of the government want to see the state retain a strong
presence in areas of high technology and strategic interest. The majority
are wary of foreign penetration in such sectors as telecoms and energy.
These considerations will play an important part in the forthcoming
privatisation of Stet (telecoms), ENI and Enel, the electricity authority.

<TEXT>
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures tumbled yesterday following reports
of rain in Brazilian growing areas.
The January contract ended Dollars 133 down at Dollars 3,530 a tonne after
dipping below Dollars 3,500.
As speculative selling pushed the market lower the Brazilian weather reports
'had buyers holding off until the full effect. . . on the (1995-96) crop is
known', one trader explained.
Buyers were also on the sidelines during a sluggish session at the London
Metal Exchange. Dealers said nearly all metals opted to consolidate,
absorbing speculative profit-taking and selling. They added that the
underlying trend remained upwards in most cases.
The three months COPPER price closed just 50 cents down at Dollars 2,556 a
tonne, but ALUMINIUM added Dollars 12.75 to Friday's Dollars 21.25 setback
to close at Dollars 1.740.50 a tonne.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Landowners urge environmental
farm policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price support to European farmers is bound to fall further but it must be
replaced by environmental and social funding if rural areas are to survive
and prosper, according to a report by one of Britain's leading farm
organisations.
The Country Landowners Association, with 50,000 members from small farmers
to large estate owners, calls for the Common Agricultural Policy to be
transformed into a European Rural Policy.
The CLA proposals, which will be discussed by its council next week, will
fuel the debate on the need for further CAP reform in the light of the Gatt
agreement and EU enlargement to encompass the farm-intensive countries of
eastern Europe.
Its contribution draws similar conclusions to a study by a group of
independent agricultural experts for the European Commission last month,
which recommended scrapping production quotas and payments to arable farmers
for set-aside.
But Mr George Dunn, CLA economist, said the organisation did not agree with
that report's conclusion that member states, not the EU, should be
responsible for future support for rural areas.
'We don't believe our Treasury would wear any such policy if they were
allowed discretion over whether to implement it,' he said.
The CLA report says agriculture remains significant to the economy and
communities of rural areas and vital to environmental conservation, even if
its contribution to GDP in some member states is falling.
'The context of any future CAP debate must therefore be the countryside as a
whole.'
Public pressure is mounting for cuts in support to agriculture, 'the last
core industry to receive such a large amount of state support'. Continued
support is increasingly being justified by - but confused with - other
objectives such as the environment, which are targeted indirectly through
agricultural payments.
Yet current levels of funding for agri-environment programmes 'represent a
missed opportunity.' In the UK, spending on these is only about 1 per cent
of total farm support.
The CLA calls for support payments to be based on the size of a farm,
decoupling them from production. It says the existing system of production
controls reduces farmers' flexibility to respond to changing circumstances,
holds back new entrants and protects inefficient producers. It cites a
recent study of the EU cereals sector by two commission officials showing
that the CAP has lost Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.73bn) a year by keeping inefficient
farmers in production.
Hectarage payments should be reduced gradually, it argues, in step with the
growth in voluntary countryside management schemes and in non-government
sources of income.
Further funding for forestry and non-food crops and for start-up for small
businesses would be needed to help diversify the rural economy. Regional
social aid would also have to be maintained in areas where an exodus from
the land would create social and environmental problems.
The CLA acknowledges the difficulty of selling such a policy shift.
'But it is clear that the EU is set on a course of reducing support prices.
The debate has moved from 'if' there is to be a move to market prices to
'how' this will be achieved,' it says.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cereals deficit 'could be 700m
tonnes in 2025'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world could be 700m tonnes short of its annual cereal requirement by the
year 2025, according to a report published today.
Demand for cereals in developing countries is expected to double to 2bn
tonnes by that year, with another 400m tonnes required for the 'hidden' poor
who are priced out of the market, says Prof Gordon Conway, an agricultural
ecologist and vice-chancellor of Britain's Sussex University.
But growth in cereal yields in some regions is slowing and total production
in developing countries could reach only 1.7bn tonnes, he says in a paper to
be discussed in Washington this week by the Consultative Group on
International Agricultural Research.
'The shortfall could be even greater if the agricultural environment further
deteriorates,' he says. About 17 per cent of the vegetated area is degraded,
forests are being lost at an annual rate of about 16m hectares and the
global fisheries catch is stagnant or declining.
Prof Conway says western donors have cut their funding of the CGIAR - which
pays for agricultural research to help developing countries - in the belief
that population and environment are higher priorities.
Arguing that substantial investment in research is needed, Prof Conway calls
for a 'super-green revolution' to create food security and sustainable
livelihoods for the poor. 'It will not be enough to rely on the simple
transfer of technologies,' he says. 'The research institutions of
industrialised and developing countries will need to be linked in new
partnerships that reflect the opportunities created by the revolution in
modern biology.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium price rise too fast
for comfort, say analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sharply rising aluminium prices are putting intense pressure on companies to
re-start production capacity that was shut down following the international
trade agreement reached in February, analysts suggest.
Some trade delegates at their next meeting to monitor the trade deal - in
November - will be arguing that capacity should be re-started, suggests Mr
Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. He adds,
however, 'this does not mean that the (arrangement) is about to collapse.
But it does suggest to us that it is starting to crumble well before its
end-1995 deadline'.
Mr Tony Bird, of the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy organisation, also
warns: 'If (aluminium) prices continue to rise inexorably in the short term
the (trade agreement) would collapse quickly and chaotically; there would be
no easing at all of the flow of Russian metal (to the west); consumers would
be deterred from using aluminium; London Metal Exchange stocks would begin
to rise again. Put another way, the higher prices go, the harder they will
fall'.
Both analysts suggest that aluminium companies are unhappy about the recent
surge, which has taken prices to levels they did not expect until the middle
or end of 1995. Mr Arnold says, in Merrill's latest monthly metals report:
'Although most consumers, merchants and dealers are that we speak to are
looking for Dollars 1,800 a tonne in early 1995, some producers will tell
you, strictly off the record, that they don't want to see prices go that
high. The higher prices go above the Dollars 1,800 a tonne level, the more
uncompetitive the aluminium can becomes against plastic in the US and steel
in Europe'.
In his latest 'Aluminium Analysis' publication, Mr Bird suggests that
aluminium companies 'are not showing any great confidence in current price
levels'. Prices will have to fall, he adds. In the 1984-87 metals boom
aluminium prices rose too quickly in the early days and then fell by 30 per
cent over three years, he points out.
'The correction this time is most likely to take the form of a decline to
about 67 cents a pound (Dollars 1,477 a tonne) by the fourth quarter of
1995, followed by a steadier and more sustainable price rally in 1996 and
1997.' Mr Bird suggests that the 'cost justified' price today is 64 to 66
cents a pound (Dollars 1,410 to Dollars 1,455), rising to 74 cents (Dollars
1,631) in today's money in the medium term.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): A season
of mists and mellow fruitfulness - Autumn conditions across Europe have been
ideal for ploughing and planting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a difference a month makes] Four weeks ago the planting of autumn wheat
and barley on our Norfolk farm had only just begun. Activity was somewhat
feverish because we had no way of knowing when wet weather would force us
off the land. Delays would be costly and erode prospects for useful yields
next harvest.
During the previous three weeks there had been close to eight inches of
rain. The land was saturated and the season had all the makings of another
1993, when autumn sowings were not completed until near Christmas in almost
impossible conditions.
But it did not rain. Fine weather continued day after day. Those foggy
mornings that disrupted road travel were just what farmers needed and very
soon we settled into a regular routine of ploughing and planting every day
into soil that had dried to an ideal moisture content for making good seed
beds. Even very heavy clay land pulled down into a tilth better than it had
for years.
Wild mushrooms could be cut by the capful from the farms' horse meadows  - a
sure sign of a benign autumn. Green shoots sprang from the brown earth as
the newly planted seeds germinated and emerged. The leaves on the trees and
in the hedgerows turned variously to yellow and gold, brown and red; a
profusion of pastel shades to delight the eye of even the most
unappreciative countryman.
By the time the clocks changed the planting on most of the winter cereals
scheduled for this autumn had been completed. Only a few fields remain to be
done, mainly after growing crops of sugar beet and potatoes have been lifted
and cleared - work which has also progressed well in the fine weather.
It has not been an entirely trouble-free season, of course. In farming that
is not expected.
Emergence of some cereal crops has been slower than usual, probably because
of the long absence of rain. Slug damage has been severe enough in some
areas to cause a few fields, or parts of fields, to be replanted. There have
been several reports of sightings of cereal aphids on newly-planted crops,
vectors of a debilitating disease called barley yellow dwarf virus, which
may cause loss of yield and quality next harvest. In some areas in the
south-east of England that did not get the September storms farmers were
last week complaining their land was so hard and dry that they were having
to delay the completion of their plantings. The weekend rain will have
pleased them greatly. Indeed it pleased me too; for it will ensure the
germination of seeds in the fields we planted last week.
So, in dramatic contrast to last year at this time, a feelgood factor is
abroad in the British countryside. It is being enhanced by the memory of a
harvest that was better than expected in many parts of the UK; and it is
being reinforced by prices for grain that are several pounds a tonne higher
than most farmers budgeted.
Moreover a substantial portion of the grain harvested just a few weeks ago
has already been sold - although not necessarily moved from farms. Much is
the subject of forward contracts for movement some time during the winter or
spring at locked-in prices that also reflect the cost of storage.
Furthermore, the most forward-looking farmers are now considering the
possibility of locking in some sales during autumn and winter of 1995-96 for
the crops they have just planted. Forward prices, which are currently riding
on the back of the brisk current demand, are significantly above anticipated
nominal support levels for that time.
Given the ideal soil conditions into which most of this year's autumn
cereals have been planted - which, incidentally, have been repeated across
northern Europe - some farmers and traders are beginning to think yields and
the area sown in the EU may both rise and that this combination will lead to
a fall in values. Added to that is speculation that, because of the present
shortening in supplies, the European Commission may cut Set-Aside for
harvest 1995 by 2 to 3 per cent - again increasing potential production. It
is probable, therefore, that a small proportion, at least, of the 1995
harvest has already been sold at fixed prices.
It would be misleading if I did not mention the fact that the prosperity and
good times I have described as affecting arable farmers is far from
universal. The growers of apples and some vegetables and the producers of
pigs, in particular, are experiencing severe and in some cases possibly
terminal problems. Returns in those sectors are well below costs and none of
them benefit from area payments and the like from Brussels. Indeed it may be
salutary that the produce of such holdings receives little or no aid from
Brussels. Further, it is intended that market forces shall rule for all
commodities in due course.
Arable farmers should, perhaps, enjoy their unexpected good fortune while
they may.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasury long bond yield holds above 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The yield on the benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond held above the 8.00 per
cent mark yesterday, after flirting with that psychological barrier for the
past two weeks.
Late in the session, the long bond was  23/32 lower at 93 27/32 , with the
yield rising to 8.04 per cent, its highest level in about 2 1/2 years. At
the short end, the two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 1/2 , to yield 6.795
per cent.
There was no fresh economic news to influence sentiment, but concerns over
monetary policy, a weak dollar and the imminent influx of fresh supply meant
that the bearish tone established last week would not budge.
In light of last week's data, the market was convinced the Federal Reserve
would lift short-term interest rates at its November 15 policy-making
session, and they were trying to gauge how that would affect their
commitments.
Those calculations had a negative impact on trading on the day before the
Treasury is to auction Dollars 17.25bn in new two-year notes. The auction
will be followed by the sale tomorrow of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes.
The new issues may prove difficult for the market to absorb. Some analysts
were betting that the Fed will decide to lift rates aggressively in the
coming weeks, a development which would undercut the value of the new
securities. A fresh decline in the dollar against the D-Mark and yen
reinforced the pessimism.
The selling yesterday came across the board, not just at the short end. As
the long bond's prices fell, the yield climbed back over the 8.00 per cent
mark, where it has attracted buying interest in the past. But yesterday, the
higher levels prevailed.
Shrugging off encouraging inflation data in Germany, European government
bonds were depressed by continued weakness in US Treasuries and ended a
listless session weaker across the board.
In addition to the bearish sentiment spreading from across the Atlantic, the
prospect of fresh supply this week in the German, UK, Japanese, Italian, Ecu
and US markets, and continued investor abstinence, put a damper on prices.
German government bonds ended the day about 1/3 point weaker, unimpressed by
reports that consumer prices in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wurttemberg
rose by only 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-October. Although the news
gave bunds a brief lift, the gains were not sustainable.
'When you get good news and prices don't rise, that usually indicates that a
market wants to go down,' said a Frankfurt bund dealer.
In after-hours trading, the December bund future on Liffe breached key
technical support at 89.50, which does not bode well for the near term, a
dealer said. It ended at 89.46, down 0.36 points on the day.
In spite of their unimpressive performance, bunds are still the best bet in
current bond market conditions, said Mr Adrian James, bond strategist at
NatWest Markets. 'Bunds may not necessarily do well in absolute terms, but
they still tend to outperform in this environment,' he said.
Sweden was one of the few markets which managed to out-shine bunds, lifted
by the unexpected success of the government's latest bond auction, where all
the paper in both tranches offered was snapped up by a single buyer.
This sparked another sharp rise in prices, pushing the yield on the
benchmark nine-year bond down 16 basis points to 10.71 per cent.
The yield gap over bunds narrowed 22 basis points to 316 basis points. It
was as wide as 360 basis points in the middle of last week, but has been
sharply eroded by the Swedish market's strong performance in recent days.
After its speedy contraction, the spread looks 'dangerous,' warned Mr Graham
McDevitt, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets.
'We have entered the red zone,' he said, pointing to the risks facing the
Swedish market: the European Union referendum on November 13, another
increase in interest rates, and continued uncertainty on the fiscal front.
UK gilts fell by more than  1/2 point, dragged lower by the US market and
weighed down further by the prospect of Pounds 2.5bn of new supply at
tomorrow's gilt auction. However, dealers said they expected the issue to
meet solid demand since it was next year's new five-year benchmark.
The December long gilt futures contract slipped by points to 101 15/32.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Guinea in telecoms sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to the African republic of Guinea are this week studying proposals
submitted by foreign investors to privatise the national telecommunications
company.
Foreign companies had until last week to submit proposals for the state-run
international and domestic telecommunications company (Sotelgui). The
privatisation is part of the Guinean government's sell-off programme, which
also involves the energy sector and hotels.
Mr Arnaud Casalis, of Arthur Andersen Paris, the international accounting
and consulting group brought in to advise the government, said: 'We have
convinced the government that it would be better to use the funds to develop
the company rather than bring in money for the government.'
The deal involves the sale of a minority stake of up to 49 per cent. Mr
Casalis said a later tranche of up to 51 per cent would be aimed at Guinean
nationals. A decision on the foreign proposals would be made in late
December.
Belgium granted a BFr100m loan to Guinea in 1993 to enable the country to
set up a 300-line digital telephone exchange.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Short-dated dollar deals aimed at
retail investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market was yesterday dominated by short-dated dollar deals
aimed at retail investors.
The World Bank announced it was planning a Y200bn global deal. Co-leads were
named as Merrill Lynch, Nikko and Nomura.
Sources in the market not connected with the deal said the World Bank bond
would probably be in the 10-year maturity, and be priced at 8 basis points
over the No 174 Japanese government bond.
One syndicate manager said that although the bond would be a global
offering, much of the demand would be in Japan. 'There is no demand for yen
bonds in the US and Europe now,' he said.
A long-dated Spanish peseta deal is also rumoured to be in the offing.
In the dollar sector, Peregrine Capital created an unusual structure for a
Dollars 250m bond with a 7 per cent coupon due 2001 for Hutchison Delta
Finance.
The bonds will be exchangeable into ordinary shares of Hutchison Delta
Ports, which has said it will seek a listing within seven years, Peregrine
said. If no initial public offering has taken place by the redemption date
the issuer is required to redeem the bonds at 124.078 per cent of the
principal plus accrued interest.
Peregrine said that demand had come from the US and Europe for the bonds,
which are guaranteed by Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate.
Also in the dollar sector, SBC brought its third issue this year for
Rabobank Nederland, a four-year Dollars 250m offering with a 7.5 per cent
coupon. This deal saw good demand from its target of Swiss retail and small
institutions. SBC said spreads on the two other deals for Rabobank this year
have tightened since issue.
IBJ's Dollars 150m offering from Swedish Export Credit was aimed at European
retail customers, mostly in the Benelux region and Switzerland, and as is
usual with issues of this type was expected to take a few days to clear.
Goldman Sachs brought a Y15bn floating-rate note issue for J-Cars and
reported good demand for the first securitisation of car loan receivables
from Japan. When freed to trade the spread tightened by 2 basis points,
Goldman said.
Deutsche Bank took advantage of unsatisfied demand for the recent World Bank
offering and brought a L200bn deal for the Republic of Austria. Sales were
mainly outside Italy.
A four-year DM200m deal for Export Development Corp of Canada, brought by
Merrill Lynch Frankfurt, was targeted at European retail and Canadian
institutional investors and met good demand.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Italian
index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International investors should enjoy easier access to the Italian equities
market following the launch of two new derivatives products. NatWest Markets
will today launch a series of call warrants related to each constituent
share of Italy's MIB-30 index, while Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank,
yesterday issued warrants on the MIB index itself.
Both developments come ahead of the expected launch in November of stock
index futures on the Milan exchange. They should help further improve market
liquidity.
NatWest has launched warrants exercisable into several Italian stocks,
including Fiat and Olivetti, over the past 18 months. It will create a
liquid secondary market in the warrants by publishing 'live' two-way prices
on Reuters. 'This will give investors flexibility, choice and guaranteed
liquidity,' said Mr Nick Conington, a director of derivatives at NatWest
Securities.
The new warrants will be offered with a one-year maturity to fill a
'perceived gap' in the market, explained Mr Conington. 'Options quoted on
the Milan bourse, known as premi, typically have a life of just one or two
months,' he said.
Morgan Stanley's warrants are on the MIB-30 index, which has been chosen as
the official index of the Italian stock exchange. The bank said the issues
are 'intended to provide investors with similar exposures to those that
would be obtained on a traditional traded option market.'
Maturities coincide with anticipated futures expiry dates. Morgan Stanley is
issuing calls and puts at each strike and maturity to allow investors to
choose the warrant most suited to their needs.
The bank launched warrants on Italy's BCI-30 index in July last year and
remains an active player in that market.
Trading is expected to start in the stock index future on November 28 on
Milan's 'telematico' screen-based system.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amex aims to win back market
share - The US exchange's new chairman is seeking a turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The American Stock Exchange, once the US's second stock exchange, is seeking
to reverse its flagging fortunes, according to its new chairman and chief
executive, Mr Richard Syron. 'We are changing the direction of the
exchange,' he says.
The Amex badly needs such a change. It has slipped in the past 10 to 15
years and now seriously lags Nasdaq, a rival market which also specialises
in listing shares of smaller, growth-oriented companies, and which has been
so successful that it is now the world's second largest stock market.
In 1980, both Nasdaq and the Amex had average daily turnover of under
Dollars 50m. By 1993, the value of daily turnover on the Amex had risen less
than five-fold to Dollars 225m, while turnover on Nasdaq had soared to
Dollars 1.2bn, 24 times its 1980 total.
The disappointing growth in turnover has forced the Amex to turn to
non-traditional equity products, such as stock and currency options and
other derivative products.
These now account for about half of all products listed on the exchange, and
while trades in these are less profitable for the Amex itself, they are more
profitable for the exchange's member firms who trade them.
Mr Syron hopes to promote the Amex first through the virtues of its trading
system, which is more transparent and less expensive for investors than
Nasdaq - a decentralised system of dealers trading via computers. The US
Justice Department's investigation into alleged price fixing on Nasdaq
should help to underscore the merits of alternative trading systems, he
says.
The Amex, like the much larger New York Stock Exchange, operates an auction
market in which investors' buy and sell orders are matched in a central
market place where prices are determined by supply and demand. In most
cases, trades are completed without the intervention of an intermediary, but
where one side of a order remains unmatched, Amex specialists, or
marketmakers, stand ready to complete every trade.
The Amex says the auction system ensures spreads between the best price bid
and offered for a given stock are as narrow as possible - in the exchange's
case, they average 22 cents per bargain. In contrast, it says the average
spread for a Nasdaq stock is 56 cents per bargain. Mr Syron claims that had
Nasdaq stocks traded at the same spreads available in Amex-listed stocks, it
would have saved investors some Dollars 4bn last year.
The Amex argues that its trading system is also better for companies because
it reduces volatility in prices.
The exchange is also trying to revamp its image by flexing its regulatory
muscles - an exercise it has practised infrequently over the past decade.
Just two weeks ago, it delisted two companies for regulatory reasons, the
first time it has done so since 1971.
Beta Wells Inc and Conversion Industries, had allegedly failed to comply
with the Amex's disclosure rules, which require companies to make timely and
accurate statements about trading conditions.
For the Amex voluntarily to surrender two companies when it is fighting
desperately to attract new business from its far more successful competitors
may seem counter-productive. But Mr Syron, a former president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, says the move is a sign of the direction the
exchange must take to preserve its future.
'We are and we want to be perceived more as a quality exchange which is fair
to investors,' Mr Syron said, adding: 'That is completely compatible with
our commercial interests.' He says investors will increasingly expect
exchanges to protect them and their assets from abuse.
The fact that individuals will have to make greater provision for retirement
means US investors will want to achieve higher returns for their savings, he
says. That will require shifting out of the low-yielding fixed income
securities for pension investment into higher-yielding, but potentially
riskier, equities.
'The whole issue of investor protection is going to be very important from a
political perspective,' Mr Syron says.
An exchange which is perceived as a tough regulator will have a competitive
edge over one that is not, he argues.
To that end, the Amex has appointed a committee of its non-executive board
members to examine the rigour with which the exchange applies its own
listing standards.
'There are pressures for us to obtain listings,' he concedes. Also, the
exchange is reviewing its listing requirements to consider whether they
should be made more, or less, tough.
Other measures aimed at encouraging companies to list their shares include
the creation of an investor relations department to help develop
communication strategies - seen as particularly important for non-US
companies listing American Depositary Shares.
In seeking niche businesses for itself, the Amex has targeted the ADS market
of foreign companies. The UK conglomerate BAT, for instance, has listed its
American Depositary Shares on the Amex.
Meanwhile, the exchange is also planning its first print media advertising
campaign and has hired its first marketing professional to put in place a
formal strategy.
The Amex is also examining the potential for new products, including one
aimed at retail investors who wish to buy odd-lots of older US government
bonds.
Mr Syron concedes that the Amex, whose slogan is 'fair trade, fair practice,
fair play', has some way to go to win back some of the market share it lost
to Nasdaq since 1980, but he believes it is making a start. 'You have to
deal with image from the inside out,' he says.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa issue increased to
meet demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Strong demand by investors for shares in Lufthansa, the German airline, has
led to the placing of a further 1m shares by Dresdner Bank to bring the
total raised by the privatisation issue up to nearly DM1.1bn (Dollars 730m).
Dresdner, which co-ordinated the issue, said it had placed these extra
shares, initially held back under the so-called 'green-shoe' option, to meet
excess demand and stabilise the share price.
This was the first German privatisation to use the book-building method of
collecting investors' bids, which is designed to help set the most
appropriate selling price and pinpoint long-term investors.
The Lufthansa issue, which the green-shoe allocation brings up to 6m shares,
was heavily oversubscribed and seen in the market as a precursor to the much
bigger Deutsche Telekom issue, expected early in 1996.
The Lufthansa shares - priced at DM182, a small discount to the market level
at end-September - were made available by the Bonn government, which waived
its allocation under the recent rights issue. This brought its share in the
airline down to about 40 per cent from just over 50 per cent. Yesterday, the
shares closed at DM186.
The partial sell-off of government shares in Deutsche Telekom, the German
telephone monopoly, is likely to raise more than DM10bn when the first
tranche is issued. Details still have to be worked out, including the choice
of banks to manage the issue.
More than 20 foreign banks have recently been putting their case in Bonn to
try to win the mandate of global co-ordinator. The German placing is
expected to be shared between Dresdner and Deutsche Bank.

Canadian forest products companies have reported big improvements in
third-quarter performance stemming from strong demand, higher prices and the
lower Canadian dollar.
The price rises cover most paper and packaging products, from newsprint to
containerboard. North American timber prices, however, moderated as the
threat of strikes in British Columbia waned.
Japanese markets for specialised Canadian wood products turned higher.
Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, sharply cut its
third-quarter loss to CDollars 5.7m (USDollars 4.2m), or 6 cents a common
share, from CDollars 26.8m, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Operating profit
more than doubled to CDollars 8.7m, while sales rose 18.5 per cent to
CDollars 552.6m.
North American newsprint producers have raised prices twice so far this
year, and have announced a third increase, equivalent to a 7 per cent cut in
discounts.
Abitibi said that 'the fundamental drivers of the newsprint business
continue to improve', with newsprint consumption at US daily newspapers up
4.9 per cent last year. In the first nine months of 1994, newsprint
shipments to overseas markets jumped 43 per cent.
Noranda Forest, now solely an eastern producer, posted a third-quarter net
profit of CDollars 28m, or 18 cents a share, against CDollars 6m, or 2 cents
a share, a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 457m, against CDollars 381m. Nine-month profit was
CDollars 82m, or 55 cents, against a loss of CDollars 42m, or 38 cents,
(including a CDollars 66m loss on the sale of 49 per cent of MacMillan
Bloedel).
Doman, a western timber and pulp producer, had third-quarter net profit of
CDollars 7.4m, or 17 cents a share, against CDollars 11.1m, or 30 cents, on
revenues of CDollars 193m against CDollars 155m.
Primex, a big exporter to Japan, had third-quarter net of CDollars 4.8m, or
56 cents, against CDollars 1.47m, or 17 cents, on sales of CDollars 63m
against CDollars 41m.
West Fraser Timber, an integrated producer, earned CDollars 29.6m, or
CDollars 1.30 a share, up from CDollars 10.1m, or 53 cents, on sales of
CDollars 339m against CDollars 228m.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Samsung drives on towards
globalisation - The Korean group is in the throes of a management revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision by Samsung to build a large electronics complex in the
Cleveland region of north-east England is the latest move by South Korea's
largest chaebol (conglomerate) to transform itself into one of the world's
leading multinational corporations.
In the past few weeks, Samsung has also announced the establishment of large
manufacturing facilities in China, Thailand and Mexico.
The drive toward globalisation is causing a management revolution at
Samsung, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor memory chips and
one of Korea's leading producers of consumer electronics, ships, machinery
and petrochemicals.
Mr Lee Kun-hee, chairman, is deeply concerned that the group, which his
father founded in 1938 as a rice-trading and textile business, remains
psychologically ill-prepared to compete in the global market.
The 52-year-old Mr Lee, who was educated in Japan and the US, last year
introduced management reforms that emphasise individual initiative in a
group that was known for its rigid hierarchical structure and was heavily
influenced by Japanese corporate practices.
Announcing the changes, the normally reclusive Mr Lee distributed videotapes
of lectures to senior management that engaged in masochistic corporate
self-criticism. He warned that Samsung was in danger of becoming a
second-rate international business unless the group rapidly shifted its
focus from quantity to quality and overhauled its cumbersome bureaucracy.
'Despite the enormous changes in the world, Samsung has yet to comprehend
how far behind we are in these rapidly changing and competitive times,' he
wrote in a group pamphlet that has become mandatory reading for employees.
Mr Lee's diatribe was sparked after a trip to the US, where retailers told
him that Samsung consumer electronics suffered from a poor image because of
high defect rates.
As part of its new approach, Samsung's 180,000 employees in Korea work a
shorter and earlier schedule of 7am to 4pm to encourage them to be more
productive.
Senior executives must spend four days out of their six-day week at
factories and meet customers and suppliers instead of remaining behind their
desks. Workers are instructed to stop assembly line operations when they
spot a production defect and fix the problem. Managers are sent on trips
abroad, ranging from three months to one year, to study local market
conditions and improve their understanding of different cultures.
It is too early to say whether these management practices are cosmetic or
will have a significant effect on corporate performance. But there has been
resistance among employees to changes, which are considered 'too radical',
according to one Samsung executive. An internal survey revealed that a
majority of workers disliked the new working hours.
Samsung has no plans to export these management practices to its overseas
facilities. Moreover, the group seems torn between its traditional
commitment to growth and Mr Lee's goal of promoting quality at the expense
of quantity, even if it means loss of market share.
Samsung and other chaebol are increasingly aware that rampant
diversification is hindering global competitiveness. The groups need to
concentrate on a few core industries to achieve success abroad, but Samsung
is still finding it difficult to wean itself away from empire-building.
The most controversial aspect of Samsung's corporate strategy is its plan to
enter the passenger car business by 1997 at a cost of at least Dollars 5bn.
The government, and some analysts, warn that the move is risky because Korea
could face a production glut in the next few years, as the country's four
existing carmakers expand capacity to as much as 6m vehicles a year.
'We need to develop car manufacturing if our engineering operations are to
be competitive in the early 21st century, while remaining one of Samsung's
main business areas,' said Mr Kim Moo, vice-president of Samsung Heavy
Industries, which is managing the car project.
Samsung needs to develop other industries that will match the success of its
electronics business, which accounted for 55 per cent of the group's net
profits of Won418bn (Dollars 524m) in 1993, but only a quarter of its total
sales of Won41,365bn. Other Samsung businesses are much less profitable.
But one problem with the car project is that it will divert financial
resources from the electronics business, when the group needs to spend vast
sums on the development and production of a new-generation 256-megabit
memory chip and other costly programmes to strengthen its position as one of
the world's leading electronics companies.
Whether Samsung can achieve balanced growth, without encouraging excessive
diversification, may prove to be the true test of Mr Lee's management
reforms.

The combined pre-tax profits of South Korea's 32 securities houses during
the first half of fiscal 1994, to end-September, rose by 21 per cent to
Won329.6bn (Dollars 413.2m), according to the securities supervisory board.
The increase reflected growth in commission fees resulting from the recovery
of the Seoul bourse, with total securities transactions rising by 37 per
cent.
Brokerage firms also benefited from increased income from stock investments
and lower financial costs.
Daewoo Securities, South Korea's largest brokerage firm, reported a 26.6 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits to Won50.4bn, while net profits grew by 26.7
per cent to Won31.2bn. Sales climbed by 23.5 per cent to Won211.4bn.
Daewoo forecast that pre-tax profits would reach Won135bn for the full year.
Among other houses reporting pre-tax profits, Hanshin Securities rose by 105
per cent to Won47.3bn; Ssangyong Investment &amp; Securities advanced 35 per
cent to Won25.2bn; Lucky Securities's profits fell by 22 per cent to
Won21.7bn; and Daishin Securities declined 39.6 per cent to Won20.1bn.
At Shin Young Securities, pre-tax profits grew by 30 per cent to Won17.6bn;
Dongsuh Securities reported a 34.8 per cent fall to Won14.2bn; Hyundai
Securities' profits rose by 11.9 per cent to Won13.1bn; and Sangup
Securities had a 26.5 per cent increase in profits to Won11.9bn.
Two houses reported losses, Hanyang having a deficit of Won2.8bn and Dongbu
Securities a loss of Won165m.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Malbak benefits from consumer
spending upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Malbak, the South African industrial group, benefited from an improvement in
consumer spending in the final quarter to increase after-tax earnings to
R545m (Dollars 83.8m) for the year to August, up from R479m a year ago.
Turnover rose 15 per cent to R12.6bn from R11bn previously. However,
Malbak's operating margin fell to 6.9 per cent from 7.5 per cent, although
the group attributed this to expansion in branded consumer products, which
are subject to lower margins.
Pharmaceuticals group SA Druggists boosted its contribution to earnings to
17 per cent from 14 per cent on the back of improved productivity.
Branded consumer products, including furniture group Ellerines and
electronics manufacturer Tedelex, also did well, raising combined earnings
to R88m from R59m.
Packaging group Holdains kept earnings steady at R65m in spite of having to
restructure its plastics division, but food processor Foodcorp was hurt by
weak trading conditions and could manage only a 5 per cent rise in income to
R78m from R73m.
Mr Grant Thomas, group executive chairman, said that although conditions had
improved, the recovery in spending remained fragile.
Most of the group's companies have elected to award capitalisation share
issues in place of dividends to help fund new capital expenditure.
Malbak will take up its shares in each case, but has increased its own final
dividend to 24.5 cents from 22.5 cents, raising the total for the year to
38.5 cents from 35 cents previously.
Malbak is to acquire Defy, a big domestic manufacturer of white goods, from
TEK for R130m.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia prepares to
demerge mobile phone arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications operating
company, yesterday gave the go-ahead for the demerger of its mobile
telephone operations in the first half of next year.
Telecom Italia's shareholders should approve the operation in late April or
early May next year, and shares in the new cellular phone company will
immediately be quoted on the Italian stock exchange.
Investors will receive shares in the new company in proportion to their
existing holdings in Telecom Italia. That means that about 60 per cent of
the mobile phone operation will be owned by Stet, Telecom Italia's
state-controlled parent company, which should itself be privatised later in
1995.
The remainder of the mobile phone company's shares will go to Telecom
Italia's existing minority shareholders.
Analysts estimate that Telecom Italia's mobile phone business could be worth
as much as L9,000bn (Dollars 5.8bn).
The demerger is the latest step in the restructuring of Italy's
state-controlled telecoms sector, which began earlier this year with the
merger between five telecoms operating companies - including Sip, the main
domestic operator - to form Telecom Italia.
Telecom Italia's mobile telephone business will soon face competition from
the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium, headed by Olivetti, the Italian
computer group, which won Italy's second cellular phone licence in March.
Both companies hope to capitalise on the extraordinary popularity of mobile
telephones in Italy, where they are known colloquially as 'telefonini'. So
widespread is their use that Telecom Italia recently distributed a booklet
on telefonino etiquette.
Yesterday, Telecom Italia's directors also agreed that from the beginning of
next year, the group's satellite communication activities would be
transferred into a new unquoted company, jointly owned by Stet and Telecom
Italia.
Both operations meet the requirements of European Union directives on the
continuing liberalisation of the telecoms sector. In sectors already open to
competition - such as satellite services, and mobile telephony - the
companies responsible for those activities must be managed separately from
the main state-controlled monopoly.

Mr Pierre Desjardins, president and chief executive of Domtar, the Canadian
paper, packaging and building materials group, has been ousted after a
boardroom dispute over policy and management style.
Domtar's part-time board chairman, Mr Paul Gobeil, has also been removed.
Domtar confirmed the contracts of both executives were ended as of Sunday.
Insiders estimate that under the terms of their contracts, Mr Desjardins
stands to collect about CDollars 1.7m (USDollars 1.2m) and Mr Gobeil nearly
CDollars 500,000 as golden handshakes.
Mr Desjardins became head of Domtar in 1990 when profits were tumbling with
the North American recession. He had been head of John Labatt's Canadian
brewing operation. Former Liberal cabinet minister Mr Gobeil joined Domtar
in 1993.
Mr Stephen Larson, who joined Domtar as president in 1991 from Boise
Cascade, the US group, but who left last July following disagreements, has
been named Domtar's president and chief operating officer. He is also a
director.

Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest stock-listed company, yesterday reported a
rise in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr4.75bn (Dollars 730m) from NKr4.62bn
in the same period last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The result was
helped by higher prices for most of its products in spite of a weaker
third-quarter performance by the oil and gas division.
Group nine-month sales rose NKr5.1bn to NKr51.14bn as operating profit rose
NKr2bn to NKr5.35bn. Hydro said that it had virtually completed a
far-reaching restructuring programme launched three years ago for its
magnesium and agriculture business.

Maytag, the US home-appliance company that makes Hoover products, reported a
surge in net income, to Dollars 61m from Dollars 23m, for the three months
to September, on revenues up 10 per cent at Dollars 848.9m, writes Richard
Tomkins in New York. It said it was the company's best third-quarter
performance in five years.
Part of the increase was attributable to a one-time tax benefit of Dollars
20m resulting from prior operating losses and reorganisation costs in
Europe, but Maytag said that even setting this aside, net profits were up 78
per cent.
In North America, the home appliance operations were having an 'outstanding'
year, and in floor care, Hoover was having its best year since joining the
company in 1989.

Japan's ministry of finance has decided to wait until the next fiscal year,
starting on April 1, before attempting to sell the large number of Japan
Tobacco shares left over after an initial offer that failed to attract
widespread investor demand, agencies report from Tokyo.
The ministry said yesterday that 272,390 of the 666,666 shares offered in
the partial privatisation were left unsold.
The public offering price had been set at Y1.438m for JT shares which have a
face value of Y50,000 (Dollars 500). In the first round of the share offer
lottery, 145,302 winners exercised their rights to buy JT shares out of a
total of 429,339 successful bidders. In the second round, 278,000 applicants
won the right to buy shares, but only 12,054 of these actually bought the
shares, the ministry said.
The ministry was attempting to sell 436,666 JT shares through offerings
ahead of the company's listing on October 27. Of these, 7,000 have been sold
to the JT employees shareholders' group. Apart from this, the ministry had
sold 230,000 shares to investors in an auction in August.

<TEXT>
French market regulators yesterday approved the terms of a revised offer for
the restructuring of Mr Bernard Arnault's French luxury goods and retailing
empire, writes Andrew Jack in Paris. The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs
(CBV) said the offer to shareholders from Arnault &amp; Associates would be open
from today until November 23, under improved terms made public on Wednesday
last week.
Arnault initially offered minority shareholders of Financiere Agache one
share in LVMH and one share in Dior, the fashion group. It offered Au Bon
Marche shareholders five Dior shares and two LVMH shares for each four
shares they held.
Agache and Au Bon Marche are part of the LVMH empire, which spans luggage,
Cognac and champagne. Arnault &amp; Associates, an LVMH subsidiary, is one
company through which Mr Arnault controls the group.
Its revised offer changed the terms for Agache shareholders, proposing nine
Dior and nine LVMH shares for every eight shares they held. The Au Bon
Marche offer is unchanged.
Separately, LVMH confirmed it had paid FFr120m (Dollars 22m) for a 19.8 per
cent stake in Fininfo, a subsidiary of Altus Finance, the loss-making
financial group controlled by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank.

<TEXT>
Capital Cities/ABC, the US entertainment and media group, yesterday reported
a 71 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 133.7m, or 87
cents a share.
The strong results were achieved in the wake of another impressive
performance from its network and cable television businesses, and a
still-favourable advertising environment. Net revenues in the period
totalled Dollars 1.46bn, up from Dollars 1.3bn in 1993.
However, the group's profits failed to match the previous quarter, when
Capital Cities earned Dollars 189.5m on revenues of Dollars 1.54bn. Also,
earnings per share in the latest period were lifted by a 1993-94 stock
repurchase programme which reduced the number of shares outstanding by
almost 11m, to 154m.
Capital Cities' television operations once again performed well in the
quarter, with broadcasting revenues climbing 13 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn
and operating income soaring 67 per cent to Dollars 212.8m. The latter
figure was aided by the group's emphasis on keeping costs under control.
Yesterday's results were broadly in line with Wall Street forecasts, and the
shares rose Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 77 5/8.

Domtar is 20 per cent held by Caisse de Depot, Quebec's public pension fund

Domtar has spun off its newsprint operations but withdrawn a USDollars 400m

<TEXT>
Caterpillar, the world's largest producer of construction equipment, aims to
become the industry's leading force in eastern Europe, said Mr Vito
Baumgartner, chairman of Geneva-based Caterpillar Overseas.
'We are very bullish long-term about eastern Europe. Short-term, these
countries have very important challenges to overcome. But they will succeed,
and that will bring opportunities,' Mr Baumgartner said.
Caterpillar does not give turnover figures for eastern Europe, but Dollars
200m of its Dollars 1.6bn European sales last year came from direct sales to
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
It has no immediate plans to set up construction equipment plants in the
region. Mr Baumgartner said that would depend on how sales developed.
However, several of its independent dealers in western countries had already
established dealerships in the east, with the US company's encouragement.
As a result, Caterpillar had dealerships in every eastern European country,
except Latvia, and that would be 'taken care of', he said.
'Business has been very good,' said Mr Baumgartner, 'but the Czech Republic
was out of the blocks the quickest. Hungary has also done well and we have
high hopes for Poland.'
Caterpillar's position had been bolstered by Dollars 340m spent streamlining
and upgrading European manufacturing facilities - part of the Dollars 1.8bn
'Plant with a Future' programme completed last year.

Asarco, the US copper mining company, reported a Dollars 16.1m net loss in
the third quarter, in spite of rising metals prices, writes Laurie Morse.
The loss, which amounted to 39 cents a share, was the result of a previously
announced charge of Dollars 45.5m to clean up a closed smelter site in
Tacoma, Washington.
Without the charge, Asarco would have earned Dollars 14.6m, or 35 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 513m, compared with last year's third-quarter
loss of Dollars 3m, or 8 cents, on sales of Dollars 425m.
For the first nine months of the year, Asarco reported net earnings of
Dollars 15.8m, or 38 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1.4bn.
This compares with last year's loss of Dollars 58m, or Dollars 1.40 a share,
on sales of Dollars 1.3bn.

Caterpillar, the US producer of construction machinery, reported record
sales and profits in the third quarter, in spite of a continuing strike by
its United Autoworkers' union employees.
The company said earnings jumped on a 19 per cent increase in sales of
engines and machinery, and that the strike had no significant impact on its
bottom line.
Caterpillar earned Dollars 244m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in the quarter, up
from Dollars 142m, or 72 cents, in the corresponding 1993 quarter. Sales
were Dollars 3.51bn, compared with Dollars 2.81bn in the third quarter last
year.
News of the results drove Caterpillar's share price up Dollars 2 to close at
Dollars 58 1/4 on Wall Street, where analysts had expected the company to
return 85 cents a share.
For the first nine months the company earned Dollars 676m, or Dollars 3.32 a
share, on sales of Dollars 10.4bn, compared with last year's Dollars 533m,
or Dollars 2.64 a share, on sales of Dollars 8.4bn.
The strike, which began on June 21 and covers 14,000 employees at eight
Caterpillar plants in the Midwest, left nearly 6,000 salaried and management
employees to man the assembly lines during the quarter. The company also
brought in contract workers, called back retirees and hired new full-time
employees to meet production schedules.
The costs of alternative labour offset any savings garnered from not paying
striking employees, the company said.
Mr James Owens, Caterpillar's chief financial officer, said the company was
prepared to continue to operate in this mode indefinitely. Mr Owens said the
company was not asking customers to delay deliveries, but that shipments of
many products were being made based on the urgency of customer needs.
Caterpillar said that it expected a strong fourth quarter and forecast
higher worldwide sales in 1995.
