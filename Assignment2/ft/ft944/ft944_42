FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amdahl back in the black after
shake-up

<TEXT>
Amdahl, one of International Business Machines' largest competitors in the
mainframe computer market, continued its recovery in the third quarter,
after a broad restructuring last year.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 14.3m, or 12 cents a share. This
compares with a net loss of Dollars 275.7m, or Dollars 2.41 a share, in the
same period last year when the company took a Dollars 235m restructuring
charge. Revenues declined by about 7 per cent to Dollars 364m from Dollars
393m.
Demand for mainframe computers was 'relatively strong' during the quarter,
Amdahl said, with seasonal softness in Europe largely offset by strength in
all other geographic regions. Mainframe prices, which fell precipitously
over the past two years, are now 'reasonably stable'.
Amdahl blamed its revenue decline on lower sales of data storage systems
because of a product transition. The company introduced new storage products
late in the quarter.
'We've accomplished many of the goals established during last year's
restructuring,' said Mr Joseph Zemke, president and chief executive.
For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 33.9m, or 29 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 1.14bn. In the same period last year, the company
lost Dollars 539m, or Dollars 4.74 a share, on revenues of Dollars 1.24bn.
The 1993 losses included restructuring charges of Dollars 478m.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Nickel recovery helps Inco to
improve operating performance
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher metals prices helped Inco, the western world's biggest nickel
producer, to report a sharp improvement in third-quarter operating
performance.
But the Toronto-based company's bottom line was dented by an accident at one
of its Manitoba mines, which forced it to cut production by 8m lbs during
the quarter, and spend USDollars 5m on repairs.
The shortfall in deliveries was made up by purchases from other producers,
on which there was little, if any, profit.
Net earnings were USDollars 2.6m, or two cents a share, down from Dollars
91.2m, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Last year's figure included a
Dollars 127.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, gain from the sale of Inco's
controlling stake in TVX Gold, a medium-sized gold producer.
Third-quarter earnings were also hurt by a Dollars 7m payout resulting from
the early redemption of a series of Swiss franc debentures.
Sales climbed to Dollars 603.2m from Dollars 468m. Operating earnings were
Dollars 47m, compared with a Dollars 13m loss. Total debt at the end of the
quarter stood at Dollars 1.01bn, down from Dollars 1.06bn last December.
Finished nickel inventories fell to 46m lbs from from 75m lbs three months
earlier. The drop was largely attributable to summer holiday shutdowns at
the Ontario and Manitoba Divisions during the third quarter.
However, the recent recovery in the nickel market has led Inco to consider
reducing next year's holidays. The company said it may shorten the summer
shutdown from four to two weeks. Discussions with trade unions are due to be
held in the first week of December.
Total nickel deliveries rose to 125m lbs from 111m lbs. Copper shipments
were 51m lbs, up from 42m lbs.
Inco also reported an improvement in its alloys business because of higher
deliveries and reduced costs.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pfizer claims success for
rheumatoid arthritis drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The first significant successes in slowing the progression of rheumatoid
arthritis were claimed yesterday by Pfizer, the US drugs group.
The company said that clinical tests of Enablex, a drug currently awaiting
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, showed it had achieved 'a
statistically significant decrease' in the rate of joint deterioration in
patients.
The results of the tests 'presage a major therapeutic advance in the
management of the crippling disease of arthritis,' claimed Dr John Niblack,
the company's head of research and development. Full results of the trial
will be presented at the annual meeting of the American College of
Rheumatology this week.
Pfizer also yesterday said that it expected to have 14 different drugs in
late-stage trials by next year, setting the stage for a series of drug
launches that would stretch beyond the end of the decade. Dr Niblack warned
that some products might prove disappointments, but added: 'With this many
shots, there are going to be a few goals.'
The up-beat news, made at an analysts' meeting in New York, lifted Pfizer's
share price by Dollars 1 1/4 during morning trading, to Dollars 74 3/4 . The
company already trades at a higher price/earnings multiple than most
competitors, reflecting its strong pipeline of potential new drugs and a
series of successful product launches in recent years. In the latest
quarter, to the end of September, more than half Pfizer's sales came from
drugs launched this decade.
Among other products with good potential singled out by Pfizer yesterday
were Zithromax, an antibiotic whose approval the company is seeking to
extend for paediatric use.
Clinical trials had shown 'outstanding efficacy and safety data superior to
competing products,' Dr Niblack said.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Scott Paper sells energy complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Scott Paper yesterday announced the sale of its Alabama energy facility for
Dollars 350m to the Southern Company, a holding company for utilities based
in the southern states, and provided the first specific details of its plan
to sell off non-core assets and focus on the paper tissue business.
The announcement comes less than two weeks after Scott Paper agreed to sell
its SD Warren glossy paper unit for Dollars 1.6bn to an investment group
headed by Sappi, the South African paper company.
The Warren transaction, and the sale of the energy complex in Mobile,
Alabama, are the first steps in a divestment programme launched by Scott
Paper's new chairman, Mr Al Dunlap. The plan should raise about Dollars 3bn.
Scott Paper said among the assets considered for sale are the group's US and
UK food service business, its global pulp operations, another energy complex
(in Pennsylvania), about 1.5m acres of timberland, and real estate,
including the corporate headquarters in Philadelphia.
The money from the divestments will be used to reduce Scott Paper's debt,
which will stand at Dollars 1bn after the Warren deal is concluded but which
should be reduced to zero once the restructuring is finished.
Mr Dunlap, the business turnround specialist and former right-hand man to
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, came out of retirement in April
to run Scott Paper.
He said of yesterday's deal: 'This marks the completion of another key phase
of my plans for Scott. The Mobile energy complex is one of a number of
assets where we can free up capital to invest in our core business.'
The ultimate aim, said Mr Dunlap, was to reposition Scott Paper as a pure
consumer products company. The asset sales at Scott Paper are part of a
wider restructuring instituted earlier this year by Mr Dunlap. In August,
four months after joining the group, he announced that 10,500 jobs, or
almost one-third of Scott Paper's workforce, would be eliminated by the end
of the year.
Scott Paper's restructuring has been generally well-received on Wall Street,
where the group's share price has risen more than 60 per cent since Mr
Dunlap took over as chairman.
Yesterday, the stock rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 in early trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Steel traders rekindle interest
in Ilva operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two Italian steel traders have reignited interest in the sale of the flat
steels activities of Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel manufacturer, with
their attempt to assemble an international consortium to acquire the
company.
A spokesman for Mr Bruno Bolfo and Mr Vitorio Malacalza yesterday said their
consortium could propose an offer for Ilva Laminati Piani (ILP) in the next
few days.
IRI, the Italian state holding company which owns Ilva, is trying to meet a
European Commission deadline of the end of this year for the break-up and
sale of the company. In June it agreed the sale of Ilva's special steels
business, AST, to a German-Italian consortium for L600bn (Dollars 392m), but
no firm offers have been put forward for the much larger flat steels
operation.
Industry analysts expressed doubt yesterday about the viability of a
Bolfo-Malacalza offer, but the appearance of a new potential bidder could
accelerate the sale process, just when it seemed becalmed for lack of
interest. For example, Lucchini, the private Italian steel manufacturer, is
understood to be stepping up discussions with Usinor Sacilor of France about
ILP, after Mr Bolfo approached Mr Francis Mer, Usinor's chairman, with his
plans last week.
Mr Bolfo, who used to work for the export arm of Ilva's predecessor
Finsider, and Mr Malacalza claim already to have the support from CSN, the
Brazilian steel producer, and the US securities house Smith Barney, which
they say would put together funding for a minority stake in ILP. Apart from
Usinor, they are also courting Bethlehem Steel of the US and Dofasco of
Canada. Press reports suggest an offer could be worth about Dollars 900m.
Bethlehem has expressed caution about its involvement with Mr Bolfo, who
founded Duferco, an international steel trading company, in 1977.
Lucchini has said it would offer industrial backing to ILP, if required. IRI
has also been approached by a consortium organised by the Washington-based
merchant bank G William Miller, and including local Italian entrepreneurs.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: EVC sees flotation value of up
to Fl 1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVC, Europe's leading manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), yesterday
forecast its forthcoming flotation on the Amsterdam stock exchange would
value the group at between Fl 1bn and Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 595m-Dollars 718m),
although losses this year could reach Fl 500.1m.
The Dutch-based Anglo-Italian joint venture, owned by ICI of the UK and
Enichem of Italy, blamed the likely losses on extraordinary items totalling
Fl 477.4m - mainly due to a Fl 243.5m write-down on fixed assets and Fl
76.3m of rationalisation costs.
On a pro-forma basis the company said it expected to make operating profits
of Fl 88.3m, reversing three successive years of losses.
Mr Peter Hollins, director of EVC's polymers division, said the improvement
at the operating level had been driven by increased demand for PVC and cost
savings at its manufacturing plants.
While predicting further rationalisation benefits, he warned that
increasingly strict environmental regulations could slow growth in demand.
The group's preliminary prospectus, published yesterday, shows that demand
for PVC has been flat or falling in the past four years, although it expects
it to increase 1.8 per cent this year.
Mr Hollins said there had been a positive response from institutional
investors, which will be offered 7.2m of the 9m shares being issued.
The company predicted the offer price would be between Fl 70 and Fl 80 a
share. The offer is expected to raise up to Fl 720m, which will be used to
reduce group borrowing to Fl 296.2m - equivalent to gearing of 28 per cent.
ICI and Enichem will each retain 19.24 per cent of the newly floated group,
and both have undertaken not to sell their stakes before 1996.
EVC, meanwhile, will be locked into supply contracts with its parent
companies for more than 80 per cent of its raw materials.

<TEXT>
DSC Communications Corporation, a fast-growing Dallas-based
telecommunications equipment supplier, has agreed to acquire NKT Elektronik,
a Danish manufacturer of fibre-optic transmission equipment.
The consideration is Dollars 145m to be paid in cash. The deal, signed last
week, is subject to due diligence on the part of DSC.
Mr James Donald, DSC chairman, said the purchase was evidence of DSC's
commitment to being a leader in the world-wide telecommunications market.
'The acquired technology, products and employee knowledge will be
complementary to DSC's existing market position in areas of switching,
access systems and transmission systems,' he said.
NKTE's technological expertise is respected in the telecommunications
industry. It is a leader in a form of optical transmission called
synchronous digital hierarchy, which offers high gross profit margins.
Publicly quoted DSC is a 20-year-old company which specialises in
high-growth, high added-value areas of the telecommunications systems
market.
It turned over about Dollars 750m last year and is expected to have sales of
just under Dollars 1bn this year. Last year it made profits before tax of
Dollars 109m.
It has 4,500 employees in the US and currently about 250 in Europe. The NKTE
acquisition will bring DSC's European workforce up to just under 1,000.
It sells to all the leading telecommunications carriers. It is working, for
example, with British Telecommunication on a wireless system to replace
traditional copper wires in rural areas.
NKTE is a subsidiary of NKT, a manufacturer of electro-technical equipment
and industrial vacuum cleaners which is quoted on the Copenhagen stock
exchange.
NKT Elektronik last year had sales of DKr700m (Dollars 119m) and made
pre-tax profits of DKr37m.
DCS said yesterday that NKTE would become the centre for the company's
European optical transmission business and a bridgehead for the company's
expansion in other European markets.
Following the disposal of NKTE, NKT's main activities will be in cables and
the Nilfisk industrial vacuum cleaning company, which earlier this year
concluded a DKr650m deal to buy one of its main US competitors, Advanced
Machine Company of Minnesota.

unit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bollore Technologies, the diversified French industrial group, is selling a
plastics company for FFr1.2bn (Dollars 233m) and plans a further FFr2bn in
asset sales over the next year to bolster the group's financial position.
Mr Vincent Bollore, the group's head, said the sale of Frans-Bonhomme,
France's leading supplier of plastic tubes and joints, and that of a stake
in a Normandy energy distribution company, would together bring in FFr1.4bn.
However, Mr Bollore said that the group's restructuring was not over. Debt
had been reduced to FFr5.6bn by the end of September, from FFr8.3bn in
mid-1993, but this was still FFr1.6bn more than shareholders' capital, Mr
Bollore complained.
'Our debts must be brought back to the level of our own funds,' he said.
He indicated that the group's remaining energy and paper activities might be
for sale, saying that the group planned to refocus on its three core areas
of plastic film, cigarettes and shipping transport between Europe and
Africa.
Bollore is thought likely to be the main bidder for Seita, the French
state's tobacco-making monopoly, when the latter comes up for privatisation.
But Mr Bollore made clear that, for the moment, retrenchment still took
precedence over acquisitions and alliances.
He predicted that pre-tax operating profits in the second half would be
similar to the FFr193m recorded in the first half of this year.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc applies for
Renault stake
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday
said it had applied to become one of a group of stable shareholders in
Renault, the vehicles group which is being partially privatised.
According to Rhone-Poulenc, which was sold off last year, its decision to
seek an investment in Renault reflects an agreement to develop new engine
emission technologies with the motor group.
Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will work on ways to
reduce emissions from diesel engines. The aim is to equip vehicles with new
emission systems by 2000.
As part of Renault's partial privatisation, which will see the state's
shareholding reduced to just over 50 per cent from 80 per cent, the
government is seeking to form a group of long-term stable shareholders which
will hold about 5 per cent of Renault's shares between them.
In addition to Rhone-Poulenc, potential candidates include Elf-Aquitaine,
the oil group; Axa, the insurance company; Lagardere group, the
communications and defence company; and Banque Nationale de Paris. The
decision on the composition of the shareholding group will be taken by the
economy ministry in consultation with the privatisation commission, an
independent body which advises the government on privatisation issues.
Those companies selected as so-called 'partner shareholders' will buy their
shares through a private placement and will be required to hold their shares
for a specified period of time, expected to be about 18 months.
The formation of a group of stable shareholders is a common element of
French privatisations and flotations involving public-sector companies. It
has resulted in a series of cross-shareholdings between some of France's
largest industrial groups.
Elf Aquitaine and Banque Nationale de Paris, for example, took stakes in
each other at the time of their privatisations.
'It is a way of guaranteeing some stability in the shareholding structure
following the reduced participation of the state,' said one industry
observer in Paris. 'There is sometimes an industrial logic to the
investment, but it is often a case of mutual support between French business
groups.'

Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, Germany's national telephone operator, and
Microsoft of the US, the world's largest supplier of computer software, have
agreed to work together to develop multimedia products and services.
The memorandum of understanding, signed last week between Mr Bill Gates,
Microsoft chairman and Mr Horst Gellert, Telekom board member, provides for
Microsoft's Windows architecture to be used as the basis for Telekom's
developments in multimedia.
Mr Thomas Koll of Microsoft Germany said yesterday that Telekom would have
access to Microsoft's unpublished Windows95 software. He said it was
significant that Europe's largest telecommunications operator should have
chosen Microsoft's technology as the basis of their services.
However, the partnership was at a very early stage and few firm decisions
had been made. There were at this stage no financial implications, he said.
Within six months, he expected that Telekom could say how it intended to use
Windows software, which substitutes pictures on the screen for textual
instructions.
Mr Koll said no decision had been made on whether Telekom would use Tiger
Microsoft software, which is claimed to be able to use networks of
inexpensive micro computers to provide services such as video-on-demand.
Other companies are using supercomputers to provide the processing power.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portsmouth Water, the subsidiary of Brockhampton Holdings, yesterday
explained its reasons for seeking a referral last month to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission of the Director General of Water Services' proposals
for regulation of its charges.
It said the K factor, which determines prices over the next 10 years, was
lower for Portsmouth than for any of the 10 privatised water companies and
harsher than all but two of the 31 companies involved in the periodic
review. The K factor of minus 1.5 per cent compared with an average of plus
0.6 per cent for all water companies and plus 1.4 per cent for the industry
as a whole. It was therefore seeking a redetermination of its K factor from
the MMC.

<TEXT>
Abacus, the electronic components distributor, has acquired a 75 per cent
stake in Promax, which distributes Philips' products in Denmark and Sweden.
The purchase price is DKr23.6m (Pounds 2.5m), satisfied by the proceeds of a
placing of 1.58m new ordinary shares at 158p. In the event that not all the
shares are placed, the shortfall will be paid in cash.
In addition, a further 1.39m new shares have been conditionally placed at
158p to raise about Pounds 2.1m net of expenses to provide additional
working capital for Promax.
Of the extra money raised, some Pounds 700,000 will be used to acquire the
freehold premises in Jutland which the company occupies.
Promax made pre-tax profits of DKr5.5m on turnover of DKr151m in 1993, and
in the six months to June 30 achieved a profit of DKr3.9m on turnover of
DKr86.8m. Net assets at that date amounted to some DKr8.6m.

Cost controls and sales growth at its Neighbourhood Food Stores were behind
a further recovery at Cullen's Holdings, the convenience retailer.
On turnover of Pounds 3.74m (Pounds 2.37m), profits before tax for the six
months to August 28 improved to Pounds 114,000 (Pounds 18,000).
Mr Robert Rayne, chairman, said a changed product range and increased
promotional activities helped sales in the Neighbourhood stores rise by some
5 per cent, more than offsetting a small reduction in gross margins. Future
growth would be concentrated on opening new outlets, he added.
Net cash inflow from operating activities amounted to Pounds 613,000;
gearing had dropped to just under 16 per cent at the period-end.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.53p (0.07p).

EFG, the Oxford-based garden centre and horticultural products group, saw
pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 615,000 in the six months to July 31,
against Pounds 804,000.
The fall, struck despite a turnround to interest receivable of Pounds 56,000
(payable Pounds 148,000), came on turnover of Pounds 6.49m (Pounds 10m).
Stripping out discontinued activities, turnover showed an increase, the
company said.
Mr Robin Garland, chief executive, said that the main operations had
remained profitable in difficult market conditions. 'Strong cash flow and
proceeds from our rationalisation programme have considerably improved the
cash position and further strengthened the balance sheet.'
Earnings per share, on capital increased by last year's rights issue,
dropped from 3.02p to 1.31p.

FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Russian acquisition for Bula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bula Resources (Holdings), the Dublin-based oil exploration and production
company, is proceeding with its acquisition of an option to purchase a 51
per cent interest in Aki-Otyr, a Russian oil joint stock company, from the
Russian Corporation, as announced in May.
Bula has undertaken over the past few months an extensive due diligence on
Aki-Otyr. The directors said it was the first time a fully listed company
had acquired for paper a controlling interest in a Russian joint stock
company in the oil sector.
Bula proposes initially to acquire an option over the 51 per cent interest
in Aki-Otyr and at the same time to enter into a management agreement to
establish western financial controls. It said it would exercise the option
once the controls were operating satisfactorily.
The consideration for the option is Dollars 5.57m (Pounds 3.5m) and the
issue of fully paid new ordinary shares representing 8 per cent of Bula's
enlarged share capital.
Bula believes a minimum IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.9m) will be required to fund
the acquisition and provide working capital. Accordingly a placing of not
less than IPounds 2m and an offer to shareholders to raise about IPounds 12m
is being made.
Following exercise of the option, the Russian Corporation will control 26
per cent of Bula's enlarged capital.
It is proposed that Mr Alexander Marichev and Ms Tatyana Kirillova,
president and finance director respectively of the Russian Corporation, and
Mr Vladimir Krasilya, president of Aki-Otyr, will join Bula's board.
Bula also announced reduced losses of IPounds 1.95m (IPounds 2.57m), after
tax of IPounds 3,000 (IPounds 2,000), for 1993. The result includes an
exceptional loss of IPounds 1.34m on disposal of its UK operations,
including IPounds 1.19m goodwill previously written off.
Turnover was IPounds 1.29m (IPounds 1.58m) including IPounds 99,000 (IPounds
438,000) from discontinued operations.
Losses per share were cut to 0.29p (0.48p).
Bula's shares resumed trading yesterday at 3 1/2 p.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Border and CLT in radio licence link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Border Television, one of the smallest of the ITV companies, has teamed up
with CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcasting group, to acquire
radio licences in the UK.
CLT is the main shareholder in Atlantic 252, the pop music station that
broadcasts into the UK from Ireland. It recently bought a stake in Country
1035 and also operates 12 radio stations throughout mainland Europe.
The two companies have set up a 50-50 joint venture. Mr Peter Brownlow,
finance director of Border, said it was exciting that 'a tiny minnow like
Border has managed to reach this agreement with CLT'.
Over the past four years Border, which is too small to play in the ITV
takeover battles, has been gradually building up radio expertise with small
stakes in local stations. However, it was recently involved in two of five
new large regional stations which went on the air last month.
Border, whose chairman is Mr Melvyn Bragg, the writer and broadcaster, owns
Century Radio, the new commercial broadcaster in north-east England. It is
also a partner with Grampian Television in Scot FM, the new regional
broadcaster for central Scotland.
A new company, called Investors in Radio, will be headed by Mr Ron Coles,
former managing director of Midland Radio.
The plan is to apply for new radio licences and possibly even acquire
existing ones.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tourists lose their taste for Pollards
Cornish ice cream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Britain's last independent manufacturers of Cornish ice cream, the
traditional seaside treat, has gone into receivership, blaming tourists'
lack of appetite.
Pollards Cornish Ice Cream has been churning out the high fat product -
estimated calories 100 per cone - for more than 50 years, but it called in
KPMG Peat Marwick after seeing demand melt away.
'It's not been a good ice cream year despite the hot summer weather,'
according to one of the directors at the St Blazey plant in Cornwall.
'Tourist numbers in the south-west have fallen and they're spending less.'
The failure of the company, which produced 150,000 litres of ice cream a
week in the peak summer season, follows a shake-out across the industry.
Mr Geoffrey Molloy, chairman of the Ice Cream Federation, said: 'It's a very
difficult business. Manufacturers with limited resources will find it
difficult to survive because it is so weather-dependent, and the best of the
summer came before the school holidays.'
The federation, representing companies supplying 80 per cent of the market,
warned that unless Pollards can be sold as a going concern, there would be
only one large ice cream manufacturer left in Cornwall - Jeffrey's, the
Allied Foods subsidiary.
The St Blazey company is no stranger to financial upset. Pollards
Confections, its former parent, went into liquidation last year with
borrowings of Pounds 1.6m. Mr Trevor Pollard, a former director of the
family business, blamed its collapse on lenders who encouraged it to
over-expand ahead of a possible stock market flotation.
'We sold the ice cream business to a management buy-out team, but they have
obviously had a difficult time. It's a very sorry state of affairs,' he
said.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rheumatoid arthritis drug from Celltech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Celltech rose 5p to 214p yesterday after the biotechnology company
claimed it had made a breakthrough in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The group, which floated last year, said phase two clinical studies using
its new anti-arthritis drug - CDP571 - had shown 'considerable improvements'
in the symptoms suffered by patients.
'The drug has all the anti-inflammatory benefits of steroid treatment with
none of the side-effects,' said Mr Peter Fellner, chief executive.
If further trials prove successful, the company aims to sell the drug for
use in the treatment of up to 1m rheumatoid arthritis sufferers in the UK
and US. The treatment would cost 'several thousand dollars a year for each
patient', Mr Fellner added.
Although a similar drug is being developed by Centocor, the US biotechnology
company, Celltech said it could rely on strong patents to protect its
product. The patents are held jointly with Bayer, its German marketing and
R&amp;D partner.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: East Midlands warms shareholders - Why the
rec announced a special dividend and share consolidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only six months ago East Midlands Electricity was in a state of shock. Its
chairman had left, it had written off Pounds 130m of losses, and it was
forced to adopt less ambitious strategies. But yesterday, the
Nottingham-based company was able to regale its 250,000 shareholders with an
early Pounds 186m Christmas present.
There could be no clearer sign of the basic strength of the UK electricity
distribution business now that the uncertainties of the recent price review
are out of the way. But rather than follow other regional electricity
companies and pass surplus cash back to shareholders through a share
buy-back, East Midlands yesterday broke new ground by paying a special
interim dividend.
'This opens up a new front,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at
Hoare Govett.
According to Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, the dividend is fairer than a buy-back
because it enables small shareholders to benefit through a general
distribution of cash.
In a buy-back, only a limited number of shares are acquired, and these
usually belong to the big institutions who can muscle their way to the front
of the queue.
In East Midlands' case, many of its 250,000 shareholders have small numbers
of shares bought at the time of privatisation. The average holding is 200
shares, which means that the typical investor will receive a cheque for
Pounds 170. Many small shareholders are also employees, who may become more
motivated if they can share directly in the company's fortunes.
The pay-out, however, is only half the equation. East Midlands also
announced yesterday that it was consolidating its shares on a 22-for-25
basis, which will reduce the numbers of shares outstanding by about an
eighth. This is to offset the impact of the 85p dividend on the share price.
Technically, the shares should remain unchanged as a result of the exercise.
However, East Midlands will become more highly geared through the pay-out
because it will treat the Pounds 186m as if it were borrowed money. The
gearing of the balance sheet will rise from about zero to about 20 per cent,
and in the long run, this should enhance the company's earnings by a few
pence per share because the assets are made to work harder.
The consolidation will also benefit East Midlands employees who are saving
up to buy shares in a Sharesave scheme. Although they are not yet owners of
these shares, they have options to buy them at a pre-set price, and the
consolidation will ensure that they share in the upside of yesterday's
proposed transactions.
East Midlands' move also has to be seen in a wider context. If there was a
surprise about yesterday's announcement it was that it came while there is
still uncertainty about the regional electricity companies' plans to sell
off the jointly owned National Grid company, which could be worth up to
Pounds 5bn.
Mr Norman Askew, East Midlands' chief executive, declined to comment on
sell-off plans yesterday, but he said the special dividend indicated that
his company, which owns 8.4 per cent of the Grid, was keen to pass benefits
on to shareholders rather than sit on them or use them for acquisition
purposes.
The regional companies may also be worried that the controversy over soaring
electricity profits and bonuses will trigger some kind of windfall profits
tax in next month's Budget. By acting now, they can cushion any blow. Also,
the less cash they have on their balance sheets, the less attractive they
are as takeover candidates.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Singaporeans buy BS stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotts Holdings, the Singapore-based property group, has bought the Kerman
family's stake in BS Group, the property and leisure company formerly known
as Bristol Scotts.
Its acquisition of 26.97 per cent of the share capital is the culmination of
a long and acrimonious attempt by non-family shareholders to oust the
Kermans from BS. In August, Mr Anthony Kerman was deposed as chairman and
replaced by Sir Ian Rankin.
Mr Kerman, his brother Nicholas and their father Isidore, who has had a
large stake in the company since before the second world war, remain
directors. But Mr Bryan Burletson, representing Scotts Holdings, said
yesterday an agreement of the acquisition was that the Kermans would stand
down. He said Scotts would seek board representation.
Sir Ian was not involved in Scotts' negotiations with the Kermans. He
previously made it clear he would not welcome a transfer of the entire
Kerman stake to Scotts because he sought a wider and institutional
shareholding.
Scotts is quoted on the Singapore stock exchange but is controlled by the
Jumabhoy family. Mr Burletson, former chairman and chief executive of
Clayform Properties, said he was a friend and business partner of the
Jumabhoys. For the past two years they had been looking for a UK company in
which to invest. 'We alighted on BS as an interesting company. It had a very
good base from which it could expand rapidly.'
Scotts is buying 24.88 per cent of the voting shares and all of the
non-voting shares in BS. The consideration is 188p a share or Pounds 3.1m.
In addition, Mr Burletson said a legal dispute over the ownership of a
further 11 per cent of the shares had been settled. Part of these would go
to Scotts which, together with other shares it had agreed to buy, would
bring its holding to 29.9 per cent.
'We are not interested in making a full bid,' Mr Burletson said. 'We will
bring expertise and funding which can only be of enormous benefit to BS,
bearing in mind there has been an internal dispute which has completely
stultified the company.'
BS returned to the black this year for the first time since 1988, with a
pre-tax profit of Pounds 429,000 for the six months to June 30.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Moss Bros pleases City with jump to Pounds
1.92m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Moss Bros Group, the specialist men's wear retailer, outstripped City
expectations for the second time this year by trebling pre-tax profits in
the six months to July 30.
The shares jumped 37p to 375p yesterday after the company reported pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.92m (Pounds 625,000) on turnover up 18 per cent to
Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 25.5m). Analysts had forecast profits of between Pounds
1m and Pounds 1.3m.
Operating profits increased fivefold to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 304,000) as the
group maintained gross margins of about 50 per cent.
Mr Rowland Gee, managing director, said the group would expand organically,
adding six new shops to its current total of 100.
'We are not in the business of running off to buy other people's failed
brands,' he said. 'Our expansion will be careful. We will not be signing
idiotic leases.'
Moss Bros claims to have increased its share of the suit market from 6.5 per
cent to 7 per cent as competitors have withdrawn from suit sales to
concentrate on casual clothes.
The group's stores include Savoy Taylors Guild, serving the classic suit
market; The Suit Company, serving the mainstream market; and Cecil Gee, the
fashion chain. Its target customers are aged between 25 and 64.
The group remains cautious but 'confident' about the Christmas period, which
dominates its earnings. It also expects the second half to be affected by
the cost of opening two new shops in January.
Although capital expenditure increased by 43 per cent to Pounds 1.7m, net
cash also grew, from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 13.6m.
The interim dividend is doubled to 3p (1.5p) to reduce disparity. Earnings
per share trebled from 2.5p to 7.6p.
COMMENT
Moss Bros prides itself on a cautious strategy: waiting for the right shop
lease to come along in the right location, keeping cash in the bank and
targeting a mature customer, who can give the business a decent margin.
Predicting Christmas trading is notoriously difficult, but the group is
expected to show a 12 per cent increase in like-for-like sales in the second
half. According to the company, this is comfortably outstripping growth in
the men's wear market of 4 to 5 per cent this year. Analysts yesterday
raised forecasts for full-year pre-tax profits from roughly Pounds 5.3m to
Pounds 6m, giving a p/e of 16 on yesterday's closing price. This is on a par
with the sector, while Moss Bros deserves a premium. Optimists about
consumer spending may see an additional reason to buy the shares.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: The mother of kitchen sink dramas - The row
brewing over continuing losses at Pentos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A group of former senior managers at Pentos, the specialist retailer, have
accused Mr Bill McGrath, the new chief executive, of making things worse at
the lossmaking company with mistaken strategies and trading policies.
The managers were stung into comment by the worse than expected half-year
results, announced earlier this month, which showed pre-tax losses of Pounds
36m, including a further Pounds 10.5m of charges.
None of the managers would speak attributably, but they expressed concern
that the future of Pentos might be in doubt unless current policies were
changed.
One of the factors worrying them most was that there should be further
charges. Last year's losses of Pounds 70m had included large provisions.
In his recent book 'Against My Better Judgment', Mr Terry Maher, the ousted
chairman of Pentos, claimed that a small profit envisaged at the September
board meeting had been turned into the Pounds 70m loss by 'the mother and
father of 'kitchen sink' jobs' in terms of taking provisions.
One former manager said the total provisions had been so large that 'my
grandchild could now run Pentos at a profit'.
The complaints included that destocking at Dillons, the booksellers, had
been too extreme; price-cutting at Rymans, the stationers, had been too
vigorous; the group was planning to spend too much on a new centralised
computer system; and it was not listening to staff who knew how to run the
business.
'It's got far worse because of what's been done, not what Terry (Maher)
did,' said one. However, another dismissed manager said he thought the
former management team at Pentos bore much greater responsibility for the
company's problems than anything Mr McGrath was responsible for.
Mr McGrath, who once ran Wickes, the DIY chain, made it clear he was
irritated at having to defend himself against anonymous former 'disaffected
management'. But he then went through the state of Pentos, which he believes
would not have survived without the Pounds 45m rights issue which became
available in May.
'The business had bank debts of over Pounds 90m and owed suppliers nearly
Pounds 55m, and this is a company with a turnover of Pounds 245m. I think
that might put into perspective how the business had been managed up until
then,' said Mr McGrath.
The new provisions, he said, ranged from rent so far behind that it was paid
at the end of the year rather than the beginning, uncertainty over how many
gift vouchers had been issued or redeemed, unmatched invoices and overdue
personal debts on books.
'The first write-offs were not the kitchen sink. This was cleaning up what
had been a badly run administrative process. We are now improving our market
share,' Mr McGrath said.
At Dillons, he found that for 40 per cent of the stock, not a single title
had been sold in six months. The company still stocks 200,000 titles - but
these were books people wanted to buy, he added.
'We have sales parity with last year, with stocks a third lower,' he added.
Efforts have also been made to improve relationships with suppliers. Some
small publishers had in the past not been paid for up to nine months.
Mr McGrath said that when he looked into the direct mail order book business
he found teenage staff on the first floor of the company's Kensington store
sorting out cheques lined up on the carpet.
The company has now produced separate catalogues for Dillons and Hatchards,
and the business is handled by a third party supplier.
Mr McGrath believes that Rymans was 'way out of line on price', a perception
backed up by market research. Rymans was now selling at a 5 to 7 per cent
premium to out-of-town operators, a fair difference for convenience, he
said.
Athena was trying to sell picture frames at prices 40 per cent above
anything comparable. 'We are now selling picture frames 60 per cent cheaper
than a year ago with a margin that is better.'
Mr McGrath said Pentos was trading within its bank borrowing limit of Pounds
69m. The company had reached its annual peak at Pounds 63m to Pounds 64m,
and Mr McGrath was feeling positive about the Christmas period.
'We are through the worst. We have addressed the fundamentals, cleared out
the stables,' said Mr McGrath, who accepts that the previous management had
never acted with anything other than the best of intentions.
The centralised computer system is also going ahead, under the eye of an
internal committee - chaired by Mr Tony Maher, son of the former chairman.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VW absorbs Seat UK to complete British
revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the leading European vehicle maker, is to consolidate all its
vehicle importer/distributor operations in the UK through the takeover of
Seat UK by VAG (UK), which already controls the VW, Audi and Skoda brands.
Seat UK, a subsidiary of the VW group's Spanish subsidiary, is to become a
fourth franchise division of VAG (UK). It will continue to operate as a
separate franchise with an independent dealer network, and a distinct
product range and marketing and pricing structure.
The aim was to achieve 'operating efficiencies in all the central support
functions' of the different franchises, Seat UK said.
Mr Stan Cholaj, managing director, said it was expected that the Seat
operations would be transferred 'within a year' from Crawley to Milton
Keynes, where VAG UK has its headquarters.
The takeover of Seat UK by VAG (UK) will be the final step in the
consolidation of the VW group's UK operations, which have undergone a
far-reaching restructuring in the past two years.
Volkswagen acquired VAG UK, the British importer of VW and Audi vehicles,
from Lonrho, the international trading group, early last year. VAG (UK) took
over the management of Skoda Automobile UK, which imports cars from VW's
Czech subsidiary, in January.
Financial services for the four franchises have been merged under the
management of Volkswagen Financial Services (UK), and parts distribution has
also been brought under central management.
VAG (UK) has also set about separating dealer franchises, with sales and
marketing groups for each brand.
Mr Richard Ide, managing director of VAG UK, said this process would be
completed by early 1997, by which time there would be some 170 Audi
dealerships with separate showroom facilities from the VW brand. The VW
dealer network will total about 300.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: All-round growth takes John Swire to Pounds
299m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Swire, owner of Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 299m on turnover of Pounds 2.11bn for the six
months to June 30. The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 234m on
turnover of Pounds 1.9bn last time.
The bulk of the group's profits came from Swire Pacific, its listed,
partly-owned subsidiary undertaking in Hong Kong.
Trading profits of the wholly-owned businesses were slightly lower but there
was a surplus on the 1994 disposal of an office property in Japan.
Cathay Pacific experienced modest growth in profits, despite pressure on
margins and higher net charges following a fall in returns from funds under
management. The Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company turned in only a
marginal increase.
The property and industries divisions showed good growth and the insurance
arm showed a slight improvement.
Business at the Taiwan motor vehicle distribution arm was buoyant. Marine
services had good results from container terminal and dockyard operations in
Hong Kong.
John Swire has requested that the London Stock Exchange cancel the listing
of its 6.3 per cent cumulative preference shares as from December 30. It
also intends to seek shareholder approval to amend its articles of
association and for authority to purchase its preference shares. The
company's ordinary shares are unlisted.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Name change for Abbey Panels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey Panels Investments, the Coventry-based engineering company, has
changed its name to Loades following an extraordinary meeting yesterday.
The company designs and manufactures components for the motor, aerospace,
and defence industries and has reported losses for the past three years.
The name change comes after cuts in orders from large customers in the
aerospace and defence sectors and a round of redundancies as the company has
moved to cut costs.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Tony Loades, chairman, said that the new
name would be used to help promote the company. He said the original name
'implies a limited range of activities and can give an understated
impression of our capabilities'.
In the year to September 1993, the group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds
1.38m on turnover of Pounds 12.3m.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Lazard Brothers withdraws Brewers Investment Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lazard Brothers yesterday withdrew its Brewers Investment Trust, launched
late last month to invest mainly in quoted regional brewers.
The withdrawal calls time on a conditional sale to the trust by Whitbread,
the brewing and leisure group, which was to have received Pounds 27m for its
remaining shares in the regional companies.
Mr Peter Rintoul, Lazard's director of investment trusts, blamed market
conditions generally, but particularly the new issues market, which had
proved 'very difficult'. The trust was aiming to raise at least Pounds 50m.
Whitbread said the trust had potentially been a convenient route for
disposing of its regional brewery portfolio. But the collapse of the Pounds
27m deal would be no more than 'an irritant'. The sale would have ended the
'Whitbread umbrella', a 40-year-old portfolio of stocks in regional brewers
designed to protect them from takeover. Most of its shares were sold in
March for Pounds 225m in a 'bought deal' with Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
The remainder of the portfolio - including shares in HP Bulmer, the cider
maker, and brewers WH Brakspear, Hardys and Hansons and Joseph Holt - had
been deemed to be harder to sell. The price paid by the trust attracted some
criticism. Analysts suggested that instead of buying the shares at a
discount typical in such transactions, the trust had paid a very full price.
Mr Rintoul denied this. 'The portfolio was worth more today than it was when
we contracted to buy it.' He was convinced that the basis of the trust had
been correct. 'We remain very positive on the regional brewers,' he said.
The trust was to have been managed by Mr Billy Whitbread, investment manager
of Whitbread Investment Company for five years.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Chemicals lift Exxon and other US oil groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A cyclical rebound in earnings from their chemicals businesses helped Exxon
and other big US oil groups to report solid gains in underlying operating
profits for the third quarter.
The overall earnings picture was complicated by one-off factors in both the
latest and 1993 periods, however. As a result, net income at both Exxon and
Amoco fell, while Arco reported a strong rebound in profits.
The US oil majors' latest results come against the backdrop of a rise in oil
prices from a year ago. This has lifted upstream exploration and production
earnings, despite a fall in natural gas prices. Meanwhile, profit margins in
downstream refining and marketing operations were well below the levels hit
in the buoyant 1993 quarter, when the groups benefited from a sliding oil
price.
The improvements in chemical earnings at the three companies in the three
months to the end of September showed that the industry's cyclical recovery
remained on track.
Overall, the US petrochemicals industry has experienced volume growth of 7
per cent over the past year, said Mr Paul Raman, a chemicals analyst at SG
Warburg in New York. European growth in the latest period, at some 3 per
cent, continued the recovery which had lifted earnings during the second
quarter.
Higher US prices in the petrochemical products in which the energy groups
specialise - principally ethylene, polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl
chloride - were supported by a fire at an Exxon plant in Texas during the
summer. By limiting capacity, this helped to underpin price rises in the
industry.
Despite this, Exxon said its chemicals businesses earned Dollars 198m
(Pounds 125m) in the latest period, up from Dollars 46m a year before (which
was struck after a one-off tax charge of Dollars 26m.) 'Chemical product
sales were the highest in over two years, and margins also improved,' said
Mr Lee Raymond, chairman.
Mr Laurance Fuller, Amoco's chairman and chief executive, also pointed to
'higher sales volumes and margins for most (chemicals) products.' The
company reported earnings in this sector of Dollars 154m, compared with
Dollars 60m in the 1993 period. Analysts expect the bounce in petrochemical
earnings to continue in coming quarters. 'We're about halfway through the
cycle,' Mr Raman said.
Exxon reported net income of Dollars 1.15bn, down from Dollars 1.36bn after
Dollars 306m of one-off benefits a year ago. Earnings per share were 92
cents, some 10 cents ahead of expectations.
Amoco's net income of Dollars 445m after a Dollars 32m charge for
environmental clean-up compared with Dollars 520m a year before, when it
benefited from a Dollars 70m gain from asset disposals. It earned 89 cents a
share, which was also ahead of market forecasts. Arco's after-tax profits
were Dollars 435m, up from Dollars 68m, while earnings per share were
Dollars 2.67.

FT  25 OCT 94 / East Midlands to pay out Pounds 186m: Special interim
dividend of 85p is largest distribution to investors by cash-rich regional
electricity groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
East Midlands Electricity is to give Pounds 186m back to its shareholders in
a special interim dividend payment. The pay-out, which brings to nearly
Pounds 1bn the amounts returned to shareholders by privatised electricity
companies this year, drew a call from Labour for a government inquiry into
'profiteering'.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'East
Midlands consumers have been forced to pay 20 per cent more for their
electricity since privatisation and the government and the regulator have
done nothing about it.'
The Nottingham-based regional distributor is to pay 85p net per share to
shareholders who owned their shares before trading started yesterday
morning. To offset the effects of this cash outlay - the largest in the
sector so far - the company will also consolidate every 25 shares into 22
new ones. East Midlands will retain the right to buy up to 10 per cent of
its shares.
The plan, which will be put to shareholders on November 18, marks a new
departure in the industry's efforts to distribute surplus cash to
shareholders.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said the payment was more fair than share buy-backs
announced by other regional electricity companies. All investors would
benefit, he said, rather than just large ones. The special dividend and the
share consolidation will also benefit employees who are either outright
shareholders or members of savings schemes which confer options to buy
shares at a set price in the future.
The dividend will carry a tax credit, which means gross funds will be able
to reclaim tax, bringing their total receipts to more than Pounds 1 a share.
East Midlands' decision was influenced by the new strategy it adopted
earlier this year of concentrating on its core business and returning
surplus cash directly to shareholders. This followed serious losses on
diversification ventures and a top level management upheaval. Mr Rudd said
yesterday that the underlying business was strong and generating good cash
flows.
East Midlands shares fell sharply as the shares immediately went ex-special
dividend, closing down 45p at 666p, although analysts said the overall
impact should be neutral. But the electricity sector as a whole gained on
hopes of pay-outs by other companies.
Attention focused particularly on Yorkshire Electricity and Southern
Electric, the only two distributors which have not so far bought back
shares. Another candidate was Eastern Electricity which completed its
buy-back early this year, before the August review by Prof. Stephen
Littlechild, the industry regulator, which set a new price formula for the
next five years.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Pentos considers disposals to focus on Dillons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new management of Pentos, the loss-making specialist retailer, is
considering selling off most of its businesses and concentrating growth on
Dillons, the booksellers.
Mr Bill McGrath, who took over as chief executive in January, said in an
interview that Dillons had the potential to be 'tremendously profitable'.
Mr McGrath outlined his future strategy in response to complaints from a
group of former senior managers of Pentos to the Financial Times about the
running of the company. The complaints followed worse than expected pre-tax
losses of Pounds 36m in the first half to July 2.
Mr McGrath implied that the three other businesses - Ryman, the stationer;
Athena Galleries, the cards and poster chain, and Pentos Office Furniture
would be for sale at the right price.
He said the aim was to maximise shareholder value, return the company to
profit and dividend payment without going back to shareholders for further
funds.
'None of the companies is being marketed but if an offer was to be presented
to us that would expedite that process (a return to profit) we would give it
obviously serious consideration,' Mr McGrath said.
The Pentos chief executive said he was not talking about 'fire-sales'
although he conceded that with Athena, the 'most problematic' of the
companies he might take a more radical view.
He expects a cash outflow from Athena for the next two years.
The Pentos chief executive implied that he might he prepared to sell Athena
for a relatively low price.
'I think the best thing we can have for shareholders, staff and customers is
a vibrant, healthy, profitable bookselling business,' said Mr McGrath.
Analysts believe that Dillons could make profits of Pounds 5m in the second
half on 1994 compared with a trading loss of Pounds 13m in the first half.
Mr McGrath rejected all the complaints from former managers about his
strategies.
'I think I could have moved on some of the people changes quicker, but it is
always a balance. You are always wiser with 20:20 hindsight,' the Pentos
chief executive said.

FT  25 OCT 94 / USAir's loss grows to Dollars 180m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USAir, the struggling US carrier partly owned by British Airways, suffered a
net loss of Dollars 180.1m (Pounds 114m) in the third quarter, as two
crashes and increased competition contributed a decline in passenger
traffic.
The loss compares with a Dollars 177. m deficit in the corresponding three
months of 1993. On a per share basis, it works through at Dollars 3.32,
against Dollars 3.33. The results surprised most analysts, who thought USAir
would narrow its losses to Dollars 2.22 a share.
The reported figure included an unexpected one-time charge of Dollars 67.7m,
mostly to cover the cost of realigning the airline's west coast route
structure. USAir, which is plagued with the highest costs in the industry,
is struggling to bring efficiencies to its flight system.
Despite the disappointing performance, USAir's share price held fairly
steady in early trading. By midday, it was down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 4
1/4 . ADRs in British Airways, which holds a 24.7 per cent stake in USAir,
were marked down Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 60 5/8. BA has already threatened to
write off all or part of its Dollars 400.7m investment in the US carrier,
the country's sixth largest.
Revenues for the period were slightly ahead at Dollars 1.8bn, against
Dollars 1.7bn, but yields - or revenue per passenger mile - slumped nearly
10 per cent to 14.53 cents. The decline reflected a fresh round of
fare-cutting by carriers operating on USAir's east coast routes.
USAir's image has been damaged by two accidents during the quarter. Two
months after a crash in North Carolina killed 37 people, a flight with 132
people aboard went down near Pittsburgh - the carrier's fifth fatal crash in
as many years.
For the nine months, USAir's net loss was Dollars 362.9m on revenue of
Dollars 5.3bn.

Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said it would 'help Britain

FT  25 OCT 94 / London and Dublin plans for talks make progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London and Dublin yesterday acknowledged that they still had differences
over a proposed framework document for talks on Northern Ireland's future
but said they had made progress on a co-ordinated approach to dismantling
terrorist arsenals.
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds met at Chequers yesterday, accompanied
by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, Irish
foreign minister
After the meeting, the two prime ministers said they had made 'steady
progress' in the framework document intended to promote talks involving
Ulster's main constitutional parties.
But the two men acknowledged that sticking-points remained and declined to
set a date for the document's completion.
'There are still some very important issues that remain to be resolved,' Mr
Major said.
Mr Reynolds said: 'You can take it that the gap (between the two sides) is
narrower after today's meeting than it was yesterday.'
Officials will continue talks today on what Mr Major described as the
'logistics and mechanics' of arranging for weapons in the hands of
paramilitaries to be handed over.
Acknowledging that there were 'self-evident difficulties' in the process,
partly because weapons were hidden in Ulster and the Irish Republic, Mr
Major said: 'Clearly it is desirable to have a co-ordinated approach.'
He declined to say whether the handing over of weapons was likely to begin
in advance of talks between the government and Sinn Fein before the end of
the year.
The IRA has not yet agreed to hand over any weapons.
Questioned on his remarks last week, which appeared to irritate Dublin, that
plans for an Ulster assembly were separate from the framework document, Mr
Major said it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one
from the other.
The process is seen as falling into three 'strands'. One covers the
assembly; strand two concerns north and south relations; and strand three
covers relations between London and Dublin.
Mr Major said on Friday that the framework document would cover strands two
and three.
Mr Reynolds declined to say whether he would push for changes in the Irish
constitution, which enshrines Dublin's territorial claim to Ulster.
Mr Major is thought to have told his Irish counterpart that hopes for a
settlement depended on a revision of this claim.
Moderate unionists, whose support is vital to efforts to forge a settlement,
are expected to insist on such a move.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Blair backs aims of radical proposal for welfare policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party's social justice commission yesterday sought to distance
the party from its 'tax and spend' reputation in welfare policy by setting
out a 15-year strategy for reforming the UK's welfare state.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's leader, seized on the long-awaited report of the
commission chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie to signal the party's intention to
ditch its long-standing commitments to across-the-board increases in social
benefits.
Backing many of the planks of the report prepared by the commission - an
independent group set up by the party two years ago - Mr Blair flatly
rejected the emphasis placed by the 'old left' on alleviating poverty by
raising benefit levels across the board.
Instead he insisted that Labour would craft a manifesto for a
second-generation welfare state designed to spur self-improvement rather
than increase dependency. Mr Blair's backing for integrating tax and
benefits for the elderly to concentrate resources on the poorest, and the
possible taxing of the child benefit paid to the affluent, undercut two
pledges given by Labour at the 1992 election.
Those pledges - to re-establish the link between pensions and child benefit
and average earnings - committed Labour to spending an additional Pounds
3.5bn a year on higher benefits.
The commission's report proposes to continue the government's policy of
raising the basic state pension only in line with prices. A new 'pension
guarantee' will ensure higher payments to poorer pensioners on an
income-related basis.
Speaking at the launch of the report, Mr Blair signalled that it would not
be a blueprint for Labour's manifesto. But he indicated that many of its
main proposals - on nursery education and on welfare-to-work benefits as
well as pensions and child benefits - would help form the basis of Labour's
own plans.
Sir Gordon, a former director-general of fair trading, presented the report
as a strategy of renewal without serious tax implications for middle-income
earners.
The report proposes a 'maximum tax bill' to limit to 'no more than 50 per
cent' the proportion of any individual's total income which could be paid in
income tax and national insurance contributions combined.
It also proposes a national minimum wage, projects to help lone parents find
childcare and wage subsidies to encourage employers to hire long-term
unemployed.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Brussels poised to scrap rescue plan for steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER, ANDREW BAXTER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission is expected to abandon its rescue plan for the steel
industry today.
That would represent belated recognition that steelmakers in the European
Union are unwilling to make the minimum 19m-tonne capacity cuts to keep the
plan alive.
The move - backed by the plan's two chief architects, Mr Karel Van Miert,
competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner -
would remove the loose framework for curbing state aid to the steel sector.
But the impact of Brussels' withdrawal is likely to be softened by the
steady recovery in steel prices and the fact that most private and
state-owned steelmakers have increasingly sought market solutions to the
industry's troubles.
Commission officials last night defended the two-year effort to conclude the
steel rescue plan, which involved financial incentives and import relief for
Europe's steelmakers in return for cuts of between 19m and 26m tonnes in
their steelmaking capacity. Overall effective capacity is about 150m tonnes.
The first stage of the plan was agreed last December when industry ministers
approved subsidies for state-owned producers in Spain, Italy and Germany in
return for capacity cuts.
'Without the political framework of this plan, we risked having a
free-for-all on state aid in a very fragile steel market,' said one
official.
If the rescue plan is abandoned today, the December subsidies agreement will
remain in place, but the Commission would drop its quarterly guidelines for
production and delivery volumes; withdraw approval of private companies
using industry levies to finance closures; and claw back relief offered
against cheap imports.
However, some Ecu240m (Pounds 189m) aid offered to redundant steelworkers
under the EU's social plan is not expected to be affected.
Also, the Commission intends to monitor each case where it has approved
state aid in return for plant closures before judging whether to continue, a
Brussels official said. That would apply to current restructuring packages
such as the effort to eliminate steel mills in the northern Bresciani region
in Italy.
Meanwhile, Germany's economics ministry and the Treuhand privatisation
agency said they would reduce their DM1.2bn rescue for Eko Stahl, eastern
Germany's largest steel mill.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: EVC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's bottom line at EVC, the PVC business being floated by Enichem
and Imperial Chemical Industries, will not make pretty reading. On a
pro-forma basis, losses of Fl 22.6m will be exacerbated by a Fl 477.5m
extraordinary charge. But investors should not be dismayed. Profitability,
at least in the short term, should be robust as a result of rationalisation
and the cyclical upturn. The potential for cost-cutting is large: though EVC
is Europe's largest PVC maker, it has a long way to go before it is the most
efficient. If the management can reduce costs, particularly in politically
charged and unionised Italy, the benefits will fall quickly to earnings.
It is hard to gauge where EVC's earnings will peak in this cycle. That is
not just because yesterday's prospectus failed to include earnings at the
last peak. The main concern is that additional environmental legislation may
curb demand, while the return of East European imports could increase
supply. Another concern is that EVC has not spelt out how buying its raw
materials from companies which will no longer be its parents could affect
its cost base.
Investors also need to take account of the fact that EVC's tax charge will
rise rapidly after 1997, as the tax benefit of recent losses comes to an
end. All this means that earnings are likely to move ahead strongly in the
short term but the long-term prospects are probably dull. For those who buy
in the float, the timing of profit taking will prove critical.

Given the level of concern about the huge growth in derivatives, it is
hardly surprising that the Chicago futures exchanges have had a hard job
persuading their regulator to relax some of their trading rules. With
international financial authorities still feeling their way through the
fast-growing jungle, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission is right to
tread carefully.
The requirements from which the Chicago exchanges are asking for partial
exemption would not protect users of derivatives from the sort of losses
which have hit the headlines over the past few months. Most of these have
anyway stemmed from deals conducted on the over-the-counter markets where
banks provide customers with tailor-made products. The banks then frequently
use the standard products traded on the exchanges to hedge their positions.
The exchanges argue that such institutions do not need some of the
regulations originally designed to protect private investors. More to the
point, the associated costs put the exchanges at a disadvantage to the
lightly regulated OTC markets. Yet the exchanges have failed to show that
they are losing significant business to the OTC markets, over which they
provide many advantages, or to overseas exchanges. The worry for the
regulators is that changes that threaten the integrity of the exchanges
could have unforeseen consequences elsewhere. Until the dangers are better
understood, it would be advisable for playing fields to be levelled up
rather than down.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Tokyo stocks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Chartered's and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce's decision to
delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange should come as little surprise. Their
announcement yesterday brings the number of foreign groups abandoning the
exchange this year to 18. The exodus underlines the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
lack of competitiveness. The costs of a Tokyo listing are three to four
times higher than those of other international markets. Yet trading volumes
in foreign stocks are minuscule. That is partly because Japanese
institutions currently have little interest in acquiring overseas assets
while the yen continues to appreciate. But it is also because transaction
costs in Tokyo are up to eight times higher than in other markets. Japanese
investors can trade more cheaply in foreign companies' domestic markets.
They can also trade Japanese shares at less expense, which explains why 50
per cent of trading volumes in certain Japanese stocks is sometimes
transacted on London's Seaq.
Yesterday's call for further deregulation by the Keidanren, the Japanese
business federation, could not be more timely. Its proposals for
liberalising brokerage commissions and revising the securities trading tax
should be accepted by the ministry of finance. If not, Japan's financial
industry risks ending up with as much of its core based overseas as its
manufacturing counterpart.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Distribution surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a mechanism for returning cash to shareholders, East Midlands
Electricity's special dividend will attract maximum political flak. The
Pounds 186m pay-out is more visible than the share buy-backs espoused by
other electricity companies and so more susceptible to attack by Labour
politicians. But shareholders will be unworried by political sniping,
provided that the mega-dividend is a fairer and more tax-efficient way of
returning cash than share buy-backs - as East Midlands claims.
There is little in the fairness argument. It is not true, as some suggest,
that everybody benefits from dividends while only institutions which tender
their shares gain from buy-backs. Ordinary shareholders benefit too because
a share buy-back gears up a company's balance sheet, boosting earnings per
share - although the gain is not as obvious as with a mega-dividend. The tax
benefit of the special dividend is the more powerful argument. Tax-exempt
investors will definitely receive a tax credit. The best that can be said of
share-backs is that, in those which used a tender, there may be a tax
credit. In those where the company merely bought shares from a market maker,
there will certainly be no tax credit.
There is, of course, more to mega-dividends and buy-backs than tax. The
underlying aim is to leverage the balance sheet. Given the predictability of
the electricity distribution business, gearing of 50 per cent or more would
seem appropriate. By that yardstick, East Midlands - with gearing after the
dividend of 20 per cent - has much further to go. Once the uncertainty over
the flotation of the National Grid is resolved, more special dividends are
likely. Other electricity companies will come under pressure to follow suit.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Labour's new social justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A plan for modernising the welfare state, or a plan for modernising the
Labour party's vision of the welfare state? The Commission on Social Justice
may have thought it could deliver both of these things. But the missions are
distinct. The commission's final report has strengths on both counts, but
ultimately delivers only on the second.
Two years of preparation may have raised expectations unrealistically high,
but they have not been in vain. At a minimum, the 400-page document
published yesterday is a valuable compendium of suggestions for improving
the functioning of the country's out-dated system of tax and benefits.
There is little in the report that is fundamentally surprising. It is
well-known that social and economic change over the past 50 years has far
outpaced reform of the structure of the country's welfare state, with
lamentable consequences. Employment, for example, is now less likely to be
full time or long term, and more likely to be female than it was in 1945.
Yet the current benefit system does not take this sufficiently into account.
The commission's report contains a variety of sensible proposals - both
short term and long term - for reforms which would improve things. Some
could be adopted by the current government without much difficulty, and are
even similar in outline to government pilot projects now under way. Many of
the detailed training proposals in the report, for example, fall under this
head.
Starting points
Unsurprisingly, many more of the commission's solutions require a political
and financial commitment which the current government, at least, would not
be likely to contemplate. Yet in suggesting ways of regularising the
treatment of the self-employed or the creation of a new part-time
unemployment benefit, the report is helpful. It provides sensible starting
points towards answering questions which any administration must pose, in
light of recent labour market trends.
The question which the report resolutely refuses to answer is how much it
will all cost. Viewed as a Labour manifesto-in-waiting, it is perhaps
inevitable that the report shies away from explicit expenditure commitments
which could be used as ammunition in the lead-up to the next election.
Welfare state
Yet the commission has long claimed a somewhat higher, less partisan,
mission: a fundamental re-formulation of both the purpose and structure of
the welfare state. Judged in that light, the failure to cost any of its
proposals is a serious failing. Vision is one thing, but informing a truly
cross-party debate on future reforms must involve putting a price tag on the
wish-list.
In the past, public debate on the subject has tended to travel along two
separate paths: the desire for a better welfare system, on the one hand, and
the difficulties of paying for them, on the other. The commission might have
distinguished itself by bridging that divide. By and large, it chose not to.
The Labour party has been the beneficiary of this caution. By implicitly
accepting a narrower, more partisan, role for itself, the commission has
provided Mr Tony Blair with something few Labour leaders have had in the
past: that is, a well-considered volume of ideas for left-leaning social and
economic policies which spells out the interconnections between the two.
It remains to be seen whether this will be enough. On the question of
pensions, for example, the commission has provided the Labour party with a
way to means-test the support given the elderly, in all but name. As with
the taxation of child benefits for higher-rate taxpayers, the 'principle' of
universal benefits has been retained, in such a way as to mitigate their
biggest financial shortcomings. What has been missed is the opportunity for
a more radical rethink of the benefits and taxes which a modern Labour party
might embrace.
These and other examples of political fudge cloud the more visionary
elements of the report, such as the proposals for community development
trusts and for a Clinton-style 'Citizen's Service' for young people. The
Labour party will doubtless embrace both the vision, and the fudge. The
country will have to look elsewhere for the cost.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Personal View: High bond yields: too good to be true
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN RUFFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hindsight gives commentators an-swers to yesterday's conundrums, but it has
been remarkably silent as to why bond markets have fallen this year. Do the
resulting high real yields foretell inflation? Do they reflect a shortage of
capital? Or have the activities of hedge funds created a technical
distortion?
A dip into the history books suggests that the markets demand a premium to
lend to countries which they feel might default. Such a premium has not been
widely required since the 1920s and 1930s.
If it is needed today, it is because western governments are running
deficits that have built up unprecedentedly high absolute levels of debt.
These levels continue to rise in most countries.
The capital flows which will fund such debt levels are now international,
seeking out the best return. Countries with unattractive credit credentials
find it hard to attract money; they can no longer rely on the inertia of
local investors who know no better, or who have been bribed by fiscal
incentives.
The real yields now on offer may, though, prove completely unsustainable to
service. Yet even at current levels, they are still not high enough to
protect investors from the adverse currency movements that can occur.
Investing in some of these countries is unattractive on any yield basis.
Japanese investors have been learning that for the last decade and are, late
in the day, voting with their feet and refusing to buy those countries'
bonds.
It is instructive to see from the precedent of the 1920s how dangerous a
situation is thus created.
Then it was the dollar surplus that dominated the capital flows and,
uniquely, the dollar's freedom of movement around the world at that time
compares with today's. Any US investor who had obligingly lent other
nations' governments his dollars in 1918 had by 1930 lost all his money in
six leading currencies, including the D-Mark. He had also lost 86 per cent
of his currency investment in France, 93 per cent in Portugal, 70 per cent
in Italy and 50 per cent in Spain.
The exchange rate had held its own only in the Nordic currencies, sterling,
the Swiss franc, the Dutch guilder and - incredibly in the light of postwar
experience - the Argentine peso.
So it is hardly surprising that, by the early 1930s, real yields on bonds
were as high as they are today.
The ingredients in today's high bond yields are slightly different - but
only slightly. Deflationary pressures have not led to falling retail prices
as they did then, thus guaranteeing high real yields whatever the nominal
rate.
Against this, two factors are worse today. The first is the absolute burden
of debt. The other is that nominal yields are much higher. In the worst of
the 1930s, UK government stocks never yielded more than 6.1 per cent. If
inflation were to disappear today, the cost of servicing bonds at present
rates could destroy even sound finances.
One consequence of the 1920s was that governments stopped spending. John
Maynard Keynes, the economist, famously pointed out that, when citizens are
frightened to spend and corporations cannot spend, governments have a duty
to spend. Today we gaze in wonder at the naivety of the governments of the
time in struggling to balance their books in the teeth of de-flation. Seen
in context, though, it was arguably the only thing to do.
The 1920s taught a harsh lesson: take the single example of Portugal in 1919
and 1920. Its government ran a deficit of about 15 per cent of gross
national product in each of those years. The money supply went from Es273m
to Es611m, and the exchange rate against the pound from 7 to 36.6. This was
not inflation - exactly the opposite. In real terms, less money was
circulating, as is always the case when a currency collapses. This can
easily be seen in Russia today.
When markets go on strike, government spending stops. As recently as 1976 in
the UK, the International Monetary Fund halted the spending programme of a
socialist Labour government. Between the wars, it took the destruction of
most of the world's currencies to persuade governments to stop spending.
The moral is deeply deflationary. The bond markets will be as wonderful as
they were in the 15 years from 1920 for countries whose currency survives.
For others, however, the promise to deliver on real yields that have
recently been as high as 9 per cent (the going rate in Sweden, Canada, Italy
and Australia) for decades to come will be like the cheque for Pounds 2m
given by a drunken reveller to the carol singers: too good to be true.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The appeal of foreign climes: A weak domestic market is
forcing Japanese banks to increase their overseas lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the boardrooms of New York to the shopfloors of Kuala Lumpur, a
forgotten sound is rippling around the world. It is the murmur of Japanese
bankers striking deals with foreign clients.
Four years ago, the Japanese global lending explosion disintegrated amid
recession, bad debts and regulatory restraint. But Tokyo's banks are now
returning to the world's markets - awakening the fears of European and
American bankers, who remember the bruising experience of being undercut by
the Japanese on lending rates.
'After several years of declining lending overseas, we are at last starting
to see signs of a sustained increase in most markets,' said Sanwa Bank's Mr
Masateru Nakamura, deputy general manager of the international division.
In Asia, foreign lending by the main Japanese commercial banks has jumped by
12 per cent, or Y1,000bn, in the past year, with all the banks opening new
offices in Thailand, China, Malaysia and even Vietnam. In the past six
months, the banks have seen the first increase for four years in lending
volumes in America. Only European markets remain subdued, but even there
most banks expect an increase in the next year.
However, the motivation for this lending recovery is different from a decade
ago. In the 1980s, Japanese banks, bloated by the country's huge current
account and savings surpluses, became the world's leading lenders. Now,
feeling the pinch at home, these same banks have been forced to look
offshore for business to maintain growth in their balance sheets.
Domestic lending by Japan's 11 leading city banks has fallen by Y3,000bn, or
more than 1 per cent, in the last year, the first drop in decades, as
corporations continue to adjust to the over-accumulation of capital in the
1980s, and banks remain wary of repeating the mistakes that led to their bad
debt problems. In the longer term, the domestic outlook is even worse, with
companies turning away from bank lending to bond issuance as a source of
finance.
'The domestic market is so weak, we made a decision earlier this year to
step up foreign lending to fill the gap,' said Mr Tomoyuki Shoji, of
Sakura's International Planning Division. 'This is not a temporary shift,'
adds Mr Kazuaki Kitabatake at Fuji Bank's international division. 'We are
seeing a long-term structural change in our operations towards more foreign
lending.'
This view is causing alarm among foreign bankers. The last surge in Japanese
lending overseas brought claims of unfair competition. European and US
bankers argued Japanese banks could offer cheap loans because of the low
cost of funds in Japan, held down by a system of regulated deposit interest
rates.
Even more troubling was the apparently easy availability of capital which
enabled banks to expand their lending. Under Japanese rules, unrealised
gains on equity holdings could be counted as capital, a benefit that
mushroomed in significance as the Japanese stock market took off in the late
1980s.
In 1988 the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) attempted to rein in
the Japanese by imposing stricter rules on the treatment of equities as
capital. Recession at home and a mountain of bad debts around the world also
forced Japan's banks to cut their lending overseas, which peaked in 1991.
New lending has been stagnant until this year.
Eager to defuse concerns over their return to the international market, the
banks say there are important differences today. The new capital adequacy
rules require them to have much higher capital ratios than before - so
increases in lending will require larger increases in capital than
previously.
This month, the final remaining regulations capping interest rates were
removed by the Ministry of Finance, limiting the availability of cheap
funds. And the bad debt crisis of the past four years has radically altered
the creditworthiness of Japanese banks - increasing the cost of raising
funds.
But the pressure on banks to expand their overseas business in the absence
of lending growth at home will put pressure on them to keep margins thin.
More important, the apparent disappearance of some of the favourable
conditions for Japanese banks is largely illusory.
Capital adequacy ratio requirements may be tougher, but the ease with which
banks managed to replenish their capital in the early 1990s, despite falling
stock markets, mean that ratios are now well above minimum BIS levels, even
if they are below those of US and European banks. The average ratio of
capital - including share capital, convertible debt and discounted equity
holdings - to assets, for the six largest Japanese banks is more than 9.5
per cent - comfortably above the minimum 8 per cent BIS guidelines and
leaving plenty of room for expansion. Those ratios have also been helped by
the strong yen, which has cut the value of overseas loans, while leaving the
value of capital (in yen) unchanged.
Though interest rates have been deregulated, relatively relaxed monetary
conditions mean they remain much lower than in other countries. The average
deposit rate in Japan is about 3 per cent, against 5-6 per cent in Europe
and the US. Japanese banks hold a higher share of their liabilities in the
form of short-term demand deposits - which carry low interest rates - than
their US and European counterparts.
Furthermore, Japanese banks have traditionally accepted a smaller return on
assets than US and European banks. Average net interest as a proportion of
total income at the leading Japanese banks is just over 1 per cent, against
2.5 per cent in the UK and 2.9 per cent in the US. According to Mr David
Marshall at the bank credit rating agency, IBCA, this is largely due to the
way the banks were set up by government fiat after the second world war.
They were meant to channel funding at the cheapest rate from savers to
industry, to finance Japan's industrial reconstruction. Shareholders'
interests were not paramount, and the spreads the banks were prepared to
take were much lower.
For these reasons, the scope for cheap lending remains. According to Ms
Alicia Ogawa, analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo: 'Japanese banks continue
to have a significant competitive advantage over their foreign rivals. It's
just that nobody has noticed it for the past few years because they've been
cutting back.'
Now they are returning, the Japanese banks are pressing their advantage by
paring lending rates.
US and European bankers argue that loans to 'investment grade' companies
must have margins of at least 0.8 per cent over their cost of funds to cover
costs and make a return on capital. But Sanwa officials say that they are
prepared to see margins as low as 0.5-0.75 per cent. According to Sakura's
Mr Shoji, the bank will go 'no lower' than 0.25 per cent. Most other
Japanese banks are within this range.
The Japanese respond to criticism that these margins are suicidally
unprofitable by saying they are simply responding to competitive pressures
in a market where demand for capital is still relatively weak. The
Industrial Bank of Japan's senior international manager Mr Yasuharu Yoneda,
says: 'Other banks are cutting their margins, so we have to be prepared to
go lower.'
If, as seems probable, the Japanese banks start to recover their market
share in overseas lending, US and European banks may yet persuade the
regulators to take a closer look at one aspect of their business - their
treatment of bad debts. Under Japanese rules, banks have to declare as
non-performing only those loans to bankrupt companies or those on which no
interest has been paid for six months or more. Typically, US and European
bank regulators have stricter criteria, usually requiring banks to declare
loans on which interest has been cut sharply.
Since non-performing loans are offset against capital, this enables the
Japanese to increase their lending much more sharply than other banks. Mr
Marshall estimates that under US rules, the capital adequacy ratios of many
Japanese banks would be below BIS minima, prompting an even more serious
retrenchment than four years ago.
Seven years ago, there was pressure on the Japanese to adjust to the rules
of that market-place. In the end, they were forced by other factors to pull
in their horns. As they return to the fray, they can expect more hostility
from their international competitors this time.

Be sure to keep your eyes peeled next time you visit the Lord Mayor of
London's residence. When property tycoon Lord (Harold) Samuel died in 1987,
his widow offered the City of London his remarkable collection of Dutch 17th
century masters, some 80 plus paintings which now hang together in the
Mansion House. During the two-year refurbishment of the Lord Mayor's
residence, however, they were returned to Lady Samuel, who became so
attached to four of them that she became disinclined to return them on its
completion.
Which is why sharp-eyed guests of the Lord Mayor will find, in the less
well-lit corners of the now avocado and lime green walls, four
expertly-framed photographs in place of the originals.

Fresh signs of unrest in Russia where the current regime has maintained many
of the perks and privileges of former Kremlin leaders - much to the
irritation of Moscow's long-suffering residents.
In Soviet times, a special lane was reserved in the centre of major roads
enabling Politburo members to speed to and from their dachas; even now
underpasses are cordoned off when a ministerial cavalcade passes through.
However, there are heart-warming signs that the public is tiring of such
practices. Drivers on Kutuzovsky Prospect yesterday grew increasingly
frustrated at yet another ministerially-inspired traffic jam and started
honking their hooters in protest. And then - horror of horrors - the cars at
the front of the queue pushed through the red traffic lights blocking the
way for the ministerial motors. How Brezhnev's eyebrows would have curled at
such impudence.

Why did Derek Keys resign as South Africa's finance minister after such a
short time? His departure was botched and damaged investor confidence in
South Africa at a particularly sensitive time.
Keys says he stood down for 'personal reasons', but beyond that the question
has never been adequately answered. There was speculation that he did it
partly because he wanted to spend more time with a wife who did not like
politics. Any suggestion that he quit because he was fed up with South
Africa's new political regime has been stoutly denied.
Hence the news that Keys is to move to London as executive chairman of
Billiton, a subsidiary of the South African mining house he used to chair,
only adds to the mystery over the real reasons for his departure. The sight
of a respected former finance minister going back to work for one of his
former employees and basing himself mainly overseas is not the most
reassuring message for foreign investors in the new South Africa.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Canada's debt dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's publication of the Canadian government's document outlining a
new framework for economic policy was accompanied by much plain talking from
finance minister Mr Paul Martin. 'We are,' he declared, 'in hock up to our
eyeballs.' Current policy, he added, was unsustainable; and further spending
cuts or tax increases would be needed to put it back on course.
The good news for Mr Martin was that the bond markets did not take fright at
his diagnosis. But nor were they cheered by his protestations of fiscal
austerity to come. Despite the modest improvement in market sentiment since
the narrow victory for the separatist Parti Quebecois in the recent Quebec
election, the yield on 10-year government bonds remains at over 9 per cent.
Even assuming an increase in Canada's inflation rate to 2 per cent - the
midpoint of the official inflation target - the real yield would still be a
phenomenal 7 per cent. That is more than 2 1/4 percentage points above the
real yield on US Treasury bonds.
Unflattering though the comparison may be, it does not point to market fears
of a direct Canadian default. Real yields on US dollar-denominated Canadian
government bonds are closer to those on US government debt than Canadian.
Nor is inflation set to take off in the short to medium term. The question
is how far other factors can justify such a differential.
Capital importer
Part of the gap is attributable to Canada's role as a capital importer.
Despite running a consistent trade surplus, the country has had a current
account deficit in all but three of the past 20 years, largely because of
interest payments on a huge stock of external debt. Much of that foreign
debt, amounting to 44 per cent of GDP, has been used to finance current
consumption. The result is that the current account deficit this year will
be equivalent to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP at a point where Canada's chief
trading partner, the US, is close to the peak of the economic cycle.
Nor has the political worry entirely gone away, despite evidence in recent
polls that there is no great appetite in Quebec for separation. Yet by far
the most important factor in the bond market is the risk premium relating to
a spiralling debt stock which stands at 100 per cent of GDP. Canada is in
the vicious circle where deficits lead to higher interest rates, which in
turn create further budgetary problems. Such is the compounding effect of
interest on the outstanding debt that despite federal spending now being
lower today as a proportion of GDP than in the mid-1970s, fiscal deficits
have become endemic.
Faster growth
With growth of 4 1/2 per cent the federal government calculates that it will
need to run a primary budget surplus (which excludes interest) of more than
2.6 per cent before its debt to GDP ratio can begin to stabilise. Yet the
primary surplus this year will fall well short of that level; and the
federal government has always had difficulty in restraining provincial
government spending. While faster growth has offset the impact of the rise
in interest rates this year, the increase will become more damaging over
time as existing long-term debt matures.
There are two obvious policy responses. The least desirable is to monetise
the debt by borrowing from the banking system, a form of internal default by
inflation which will lead to overvaluation of the real exchange rate and
subsequent devaluation. That is what the bond markets fear. While
superficially attractive, it is no real solution because it increases the
cost of servicing the mountain of foreign denominated debt.
The alternative, which the Liberal government rightly prefers, is fiscal
adjustment. But while the government talks of root and branch social
security reform and proposes to reduce the deficit from 5.4 per cent last
year to 3 per cent by 1996-97, the markets are suspending judgment until
they see real action. Mr Martin claims that the government can deliver
predominantly through spending cuts. That hope looks pious in the light of
many previous failed attempts to cut the deficit. Without significant tax
increases, Mr Martin's next budget is unlikely to receive the endorsement
that will pave the way for lower real interest rates.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Gerstner bytes back: The IBM chief has won some respite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lou Gerstner is becoming a Wall Street hero. Since taking over at the
helm of International Business Machines 18 months ago, Mr Gerstner has
engineered a remarkable turnaround in the financial performance of the
world's largest computer company, after three years of heavy losses.
The upward trend was confirmed last week when IBM reported net profits of
Dollars 689m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, for the third quarter - well above
expectations. Revenues increased to Dollars 15.4bn, up 8.6 per cent from the
same period last year, after adjustments for the sale of a business unit and
accounting changes. For the year to date, expenses are down by Dollars 2.8bn
following 24,000 job cuts and other cost reductions.
After four consecutive quarters of profit, it appears that IBM has turned a
corner. The company's shares are trading at around Dollars 74, the highest
level in two years, reflecting growing investor confidence.
Yet IBM's new-found strength could be short-lived. Some important segments
of IBM's business are still operating at a loss and the company's improved
financial performance is at least in part the result of good luck, rather
than good management or foresight.
The paradox for IBM is that the restoration of its revenues and profits over
the last three quarters has been on the back of unexpectedly strong demand
for its mainframe computers, its flagship - and most profitable - products.
For years, IBM's business strategy centred on its mainframes as the
workhorses of corporate data processing. The company's recent difficulties
have come from its failure to respond to mounting competition from networks
of personal computers and servers.
Failing to respond to the technology shift was 'the single most important
mistake that IBM made,' Mr Gerstner said earlier this year. He ordered 'a
massive redeployment of development money' away from mainframes into new
products for networked computing.
Mr Gerstner may be tempted to believe that the mainframe resurgence signals
another sea-change in computer technology trends. IBM is currently renewing
its mainframe marketing efforts and postponing consolidation of mainframe
manufacturing operations.
'We have been listening to customers' needs and meeting them,' says Linda
Sanford, general manager for IBM's System 390 mainframe products. 'Customers
are adamant that they are not willing to abandon their investments in
mainframe software, which total over a trillion dollars worldwide,' she
says.
The mainframe is also gaining new respect as corporate computer users become
less enamoured with 'alternative solutions' based on networks. 'For
reliability and robustness you cannot beat a mainframe,' says Jerry York,
IBM chief financial officer. 'The alternatives are not yet bullet-proof
enough.'
Yet many industry observers believe that the role of central 'host'
mainframes will decline as distributed computing takes hold. The temporary
comeback of the mainframe may reflect nothing more than the economic
recovery in the US and Europe which has created a surge in new orders after
three years of depressed spending.
If so, IBM's mainframe 'bubble' will not last, leaving the company
vulnerable to the problems of some of its other businesses which are
critical to future revenue growth.
In the PC sector, for example, IBM is struggling to achieve profitability.
'Our PC problem continues,' Mr York said last week. '(It) will probably take
us until the end of 1995 to see progress that we will feel really good
about.'
Over the last year, IBM has lost market share in PCs to competitors
including Compaq Computer, which has overtaken IBM to become the market
leader. Struggling to regain its momentum, IBM has restructured its PC
operations, cut jobs and simplified overlapping product lines.
But it seems that IBM keeps bungling opportunities in the PC market. Last
month it launched a new line of 'Aptiva' consumer desktop multimedia PCs to
very positive reviews. But the IBM PC unit underestimated demand and already
has orders for all of the Aptiva PCs it can build by the end of the year.
Uncertainties surrounding the future of IBM's PC business are increased by
the company's efforts to establish the 'PowerPC' microprocessor, the heart
of a new generation of PCs, jointly developed with Motorola and Apple
Computer. But in the absence of suitable software, the project could take
years to bear fruit.
Data storage products represent another weak point for IBM. Revenues
declined by a 'double digit' percentage in the third quarter against the
same period last year, said Mr York. Although sales of disk drives for PCs
grew strongly, IBM has been losing ground in the market for high capacity
data storage systems.
Mr Gerstner said last week that he was encouraged by IBM's progress in
moving new technology 'from lab to manufacturing to market much faster'. But
data storage is an example of IBM's failure to keep pace with competitors in
exploiting new technology.
IBM is also playing catch-up in the market for PC software, which is
currently dominated by Microsoft. The recent launch of OS/2 Warp, a new PC
operating system to rival Microsoft's Windows, could give IBM a boost. But
its investments in software development currently outstrip revenues from
this important growth sector.
There are some bright spots for IBM. Sales of its AS/400 mid-range computers
increased by about 25 per cent in the third quarter, following the launch of
models earlier this year. It is also making rapid progress in the sale of
semiconductor chips to outside customers, with sales of Dollars 2.2bn to
date this year, from next to nothing two years ago.
Yet as IBM continues to pare back its spending on research and development -
down by 23 per cent in the third quarter to just over Dollars 1bn - the
company will face a crisis if revenues from older product lines, in
particular its mainframe computers, decline more quickly than growth in
other sectors.
Financial analysts expect IBM's performance to continue to improve through
1995. Mr Gerstner has also silenced the industry pundits who just two years
ago said that the only way to 'save' IBM was to break it up into smaller,
more agile businesses.
But the longer term outlook is far less certain. Even as he continues to cut
costs, the more difficult challenge facing Mr Gerstner is to generate
revenue growth on a sustained basis. So far he has not demonstrated how IBM
will achieve this goal, although as Mr York puts it, 'a huge amount of our
energies are focused on that issue'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Choice for domestic gas consumers
essential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN LOCKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Heseltine is right (Survey of the UK Gas Market: 'Support for
liberalisation gathers pace', October 20). As the president of the board of
trade points out, it is indeed high time that the 18m domestic consumers
currently served by British Gas were offered a choice of supplier.
Recent debate on the effects of competition has focused on potential moves
towards differential pricing - both from region to region and between the
high and low-volume gas users.
The links which are being made between the introduction of competition and
tariff rebalancing are, however, misplaced. It is true that re-balancing may
well take place in the near future. But adjustments would inevitably happen
anyway, regardless of competition.
Under the Gas Act 1986, the regulator, Claire Spottiswoode, must ensure that
British Gas does not discriminate in its pricing and, indeed, a review of
tariffs to ensure that they more closely reflect true costs is sorely
needed.
What is clear is that, without competition, consumers faced with higher
prices would have no choice but to pay them.
With competition, they could up sticks and buy elsewhere.
There must, of course, be vigorous public scrutiny of proposals to adjust
tariffs, to reassure domestic consumers that British Gas is not trying to
load the dice as competition looms.
Some proposed adjustments may need to be challenged; British Gas may, for
instance, have to be pressurised to reduce any inefficiencies rather than
pass costs to consumers.
As the Gas Consumers Council illustrated, in its evidence to the House of
Commons trade and industry committee on October 19, there is an overwhelming
consumer argument in favour of dismantling British Gas's monopoly.
As long as basic ground rules for competition, particularly on obligation to
supply, are established and guaranteed, and costs to market entrants are set
fairly, there is no reason why domestic consumers should not enjoy the
significant benefits promised by competition.
With the Queen's speech in the offing, the initiative lies with the
government.
It must use its leg-islative clout to promote its competitive convictions.
Gas competition is long overdue.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Hefty tax increases on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, When is a tax increase not a tax increase? Many financial commentators
 -yourselves included - give the impression that the forthcoming Budget will
be neutral. 'Mr Clarke has already ruled out significant tax cuts for this
year, while the good performance of the economy this year rules out any
further tax increases' (Editorial, 'Mr Clarke's Budget task', October 21).
It is not surprising that the chancellor has ruled out tax cuts, given that
he plans exactly the opposite - a further Pounds 6.5bn increase, announced
in the last Budget. (The main measures are, of course, the imposition of VAT
on fuel at the full rate, sharp rises in excise duties and further
restriction of Miras and the married couple's allowance relief.)
While the chancellor's desire to gloss over the fact that personal taxes
will rise sharply again in 1995-96 is understandable, it is less clear why
commentators should wish to do the same. When Mr Clarke confirms the rise,
will the Financial Times report that the Budget contained no tax increases?

FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: IMF code of economic conduct required
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WALTER GREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Despite a tendency, outside as well as within the European exchange
rate mechanism, for exchange rate fluctuations to lessen in recent years,
Peter Norman (Economics Notebook: 'Problems with exchange rates', October
17) noted a strong desire for greater exchange rate stability at the recent
IMF annual meeting - which, since few positively desire the reverse, is
hardly surprising.
However, such stability, which requires two or more countries to move in
step with each other, has to grow from the grassroots up and cannot be
imposed from above. So the IMF would be best employed using its unrivalled
experience, as well as all available publicity resources, in helping to
frame and to monitor an agreed international code of economic (fiscal as
well as monetary) conduct. Observance of this would be a passport to sound
economic management, and hence stable exchange rates, across the globe.
Given this accent on the maintenance of economic law and order at national
and later regional level, the rest, including the hitherto elusive goal of
currency stability, will follow almost automatically. Meanwhile, the IMF,
though arguably the best world central bank we have yet had with the
possible exception of the Bank of England in its heyday, still has some way
to go before it grows fully into that role.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improve state aids controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From C M PURVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article on state aids in Europe ('Controlling state aids',
October 19) rightly highlights the distortion they cause to competition and
the threat they pose to the single market.
In no case is the danger of inadequate regulation of state aids greater than
in sectors which already have excess capacity, and where growth in demand is
inadequate to restore equilibrium between demand and capacity. That is why
the European synthetic fibres industry has consistently supported the
European Union guidelines which prohibit subsidies for creation of new
capacity in our sector. Such guidelines may, as you point out, lead to
inconsistency between sectors. However, the way to deal with such
inconsistency must be to improve the standards of monitoring and control of
state aids to the best possible level - not to reduce the level of
safeguards, where they exist in a relatively effective form, to a low common
denominator.

FT  25 OCT 94 / A diluted Beveridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The overriding reason why capitalism is regarded with such moral distaste
is, 'quite simply, the inequality to which it leads, which is widely felt to
be unjust and intolerable'. The author of that observation is not some
raving Leftie. It is not even yours truly. It is Lord Lawson, in a
commentary on a recent pamphlet1. I remember visiting the former chancellor
following some of his Budgets and being struck by his seemingly puzzled
response to the simple question: 'What do your measures do for the least
well-off?' We know the answer: since 1979 successive Conservative
governments have engineered a huge redistribution of wealth and income from
the poor to the rich.
Much of the familiar evidence to this effect is rehearsed in Social Justice,
the report2 of a commission set up by the late Mr John Smith in 1992, after
he became leader of the Labour party. The Tories' principal engine for
widening inequalities is the tax mechanism. Top rates of personal income tax
were cut, most dramatically by Lawson, N, in 1988. Taxes on consumption have
more than doubled. In consequence, the net disposable income of the least
affluent tenth of the population was squeezed, certainly in relative terms
and in many instances absolutely. 'Today,' says the social justice
commission, whose chairman is Sir Gordon Borrie, 'the gap between the
earnings of the highest-paid and those of the lowest-paid workers is greater
than at any time since records were first kept in 1886.'
So we can take it, can we not, that the advice given by Sir Gordon and his
colleagues is that the evil work of the 1980s must be undone the minute a
Labour government takes office? Presumably the scaffold beckons, or the
tumbrils; surely at the very least the dungeons? Well, actually, no. The
suggestion is that there be a 'maximum tax bill', which would limit the
proportion of any individual's total income which could be paid in income
tax and national insurance contributions combined to 50 per cent. Half. The
multiest of millionaires can keep the other half. Whew] Admit it. You, I,
Nigel Lawson and King Midas would settle for that. In case Labour's putative
chancellor misses it, the page, Mr Gordon Brown, is 390.
There are many such nuggets in this thought-provoking report, some of them
similarly flavoured. A minimum wage? Yes, but, er, not too much. Say Pounds
3.50 an hour. Workfare? No - but, instead, what are called in the United
States 'welfare to work' schemes. 'Of course, someone who unreasonably turns
down a job or training offer cannot expect to continue claiming full
benefit,' says the commission. Means-tested benefits? No, never - well, yes,
for the affluent. Top-rate taxpayers might be taxed on child benefit (within
the 50 per cent ceiling?), while pensioners of ample means would be
ineligible for the proposed new higher-rate top-up state pensions.
In short Social Justice is the very model of a modern moderniser's manual.
It might help the new Labour leader to capture his party. It castigates the
unregulated free market, yet declines to return to the socialist nonsense of
earlier years. It implicitly regrets the errors of the 1970s, when Labour
was last in charge, yet says of the 1980s that 'the neo-liberals' medicine
has proved worse than the disease'. We'll leave that debatable judgment to
the historians. The question is, what about the present decade, and the one
to follow?
It would be nice to say that Sir Gordon and his happy band have provided us
with a satisfactory answer. Alas, they haven't. They have set out the pieces
of a puzzle that some of us have been reading about and sometimes even
writing about for years. The welfare state that evolved from Sir William
Beveridge's report of November 1942 is certainly in need of revision.
Beveridge could assume full employment; we can at best aspire to it. He took
it for granted that wives would return to stove and hearth after the war; we
are blessed with 1990s womanhood. He saw social insurance as a safety net of
manageable proportions; we know it to be an unstoppable, money-guzzling
leviathan. Then Britain was the mother of an empire; now it is the unruly
stepchild of the European Union.
Sir Gordon's commission calls enticingly for a readjustment, a renewal of
British economic and social policy. To that end, it provides a bran-tub full
of ideas, many of them Clintonesque, from which Labour may draw. These beads
are drawn together on a string labelled 'investors' Britain', a concept
combining 'the ethics of community with the dynamics of a market economy'.
This turns out to mean goodies like universal nursery schooling, a 'learning
bank' to ensure the availability of education and training during breaks in
employment; an 'intelligent welfare state' whose purpose is to encourage
people off the dole and into jobs, fair taxation, and a great many other
improvements to life, the universe and everything.
Such promised delights are not to be sneezed at, but can we believe that
Labour could deliver them, even in the 15 years allowed for? 'We are not . .
. a commission of economists,' say Sir Gordon &amp; Co, and thank heavens for
that. It would help, though, if they confessed to just a little numeracy.
The Beveridge report is filled with sums. They all turned out wrong in the
end, but precise columns giving totals in and totals out do add
verisimilitude to even the most alluring social blueprints. To say this is
not the same as supporting the inevitable Conservative sneer about what
taxes go up or what service is cut to pay for this or that. It is just that
the days when you could plausibly offer broad sweeps of history without the
backing of narrow calculations are long gone.
Labour will doubtless address such quibbles in its election manifesto, a
document that may be influenced by but is not likely to be congruent with
the social justice report. The party knows that it must support free trade,
low, albeit 'fair' personal taxation, minimal inflation, and the market
economy. What we will get is an undertaking by sensible politicians of
moderate persuasion to iron out the rough edges of capitalism, to make it
less red in tooth and claw. Perhaps that will ease Lord Lawson's mind.

<TEXT>
Sir, While I much appreciated your support for our cross-border credit
transfers initiative, a misunderstanding has crept into your editorial
('Paying the price', October 20).
You claim that 'there may be cases where customers are happy to split
charges' and suggest our proposed directive is 'too prescriptive' by banning
double-charging altogether.
Our proposal is that double-charging is banned only in those specific cases
where the customer has instructed the banks not to levy a charge on the
receiver.
Customers would remain entirely free to split the charges if they wished.

D'outre-Manche, not quite 'Across', as we have it, but 'Beyond the Channel',

fascinating and even shocking exhibition.
Here is no full and scholarly study of its subject and period - British art
up to the time of Queen Victoria - drawn from the wealth of French public
taste and connoisseurship. But, rather, a parade of historic French
attitudes and assumptions upon the art of our fog-shrouded and barbarous
land, that amounts to a confession.
If that wealth is not drawn upon, it is because that wealth is not there.
The French have never bothered to acquire the art of the British school  -
the distinction between the English, the Irish and the Scots is seldom made,
and ecole Anglais usually stands for all - in any substantial or
comprehensive fashion, for they have never taken our visual culture
seriously. And what they do not take seriously, they do not choose to
understand.
The contrast between our own National Gallery and the Louvre in generosity
of interest and critical even-handedness, could hardly be greater.
In Trafalgar Square we find an account of the post-Renaissance European
tradition that gives each national school its due, the French along with the
Italian, the Spanish, the Dutch and, yes, the British. What gaps there are,
as in the German and northern schools, they are admitted and, as far as
limited resources allow, addressed.
Never so, it would seem, along the quai du Louvre. 'How did I find the
show?' asked my friend in the Louvre's service presse, a little anxiously,
and gave at once her own pre-emptive answer: 'il y a beaucoup des trous.'
The show does contain some lovely things, with the magnificent Gainsborough
full-length of Lady Alston, green silk and grey shawl against a darkly
romantic setting, the best of all.
There are some good Reynolds, a decent Stubbs of Lord Curzon and his horse,
the splendid 'Captain Hay of Spott' by Raeburn and any number of Lawrences -
Lawrence after all was the painter of Europe's grandees in the
post-Napoleonic dispensation and was for a generation the best-known English
painter of them all.
But we know, and at heart the French know, that there is more to the British
School than the brief flourish of the late-Georgian swagger portrait.
So where do we begin? Neither with Holbein nor yet with Van Dyck, for they
are foreigners, so a fine full-length of Edward VI by William Scrots, a
Dutchman, will do.
What then of the Elizabethan miniaturists, Hilliard perhaps? But there is,
it seems, no Hilliard in France, and a single, exquisite portrait of the
fated Earl of Essex by Isaac Oliver, a Frenchman, must do. Into the 17th
century we go, and to the Cavaliers and the Restoration, so with no Van
Dyck, what about Dobson? No Dobson, but a little later there is Lely. Wasn't
he a foreigner, too?
Never mind. The 18th century will sort things out. Philippe Mercier and
Heinrich Fussli (Fuseli to us) are in, I see. Odd that. But we shall really
get going with Hogarth, shan't we, surely the first great painter of the
truly English school. Shan't we?
But the French, we find, have this funny idea that Hogarth wasn't really a
painter at all, but an engraver - and indeed this show reveals the curious
fixed idea that it was in the general commercial development of print-making
that our peculiarly English talents were declared.
So there is not a single Hogarth painting in the show, but only the engraved
version of the 'Marriage a la Mode'. Thomas Girtin is represented by a
single acquatint of the 'Porte Saint Denis', Rowlandson by three satirical
etchings among a group by Gillray and Cruikshank. That group is at least
included, bitterly anti-French as its satires are.
What else? A few good water-colours by Bonington, Constable, Boys and Cox,
miscellaneous drawings, some good oils including a Bonington 'Doges'
Palace', Constable's 'Weymouth Bay' and 'Helmingham Dell', and a late
unfinished Turner landscape, vaporous and magical.
And that, of any substance, is it. This is, indeed, a show which gives us
rather more to think about than actually to see.
The smaller show at the Musee Carnavalet is a wonderful corrective, if only
because the prejudice is openly celebrated in terms that are often as hugely
enjoyable as they are grotesque.
A run of post-Napoleonic jokes about French girls finding any excuse to peer
up the kilts of Scottish soldiers gets us off to a good start and there is
no looking back, or down.
Randy rost-bifs and their prim, boot-faced wives on the one hand, seductive
girls and effete 'frogs' on the other, the ancient mutual stereotypes are
funny still.
But jokes apart, the show does make the serious point that the English love
affair with France had its cultural aspect, and bore real fruit in the work
of our tourist painters. Thus represented here are not only the better-known
figures of Turner, Cox, Bonington, Girtin and Boys, but also such
comparatively minor, but still accomplished, artists as Holland, Wyld,
Callow, Chalon . . . and we think on to Whistler, Sickert, Nicholson . . .
France to us, and Paris above all, has always been irresistible.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Mixed-up Risen People - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Sheridan, the award-winning writer/director of such films as In The Name
of the Father and My Left Foot, has returned to his theatrical roots with
The Risen People, the story of the 1913 Irish labour lockout which he has
co-adapted and co-directed with his brother Peter at Dublin's Gaiety
Theatre.
Sheridan has said that he took on the project, his first play in nearly a
decade, as an experiment to incorporate the grand gestures of opera into
theatre.
And indeed there is much that is operatic about The Risen People: from the
size of the cast - 15 principals, four singers and 21 supernumeraries - to
the look and scale of the production. On a massive, elegant set of receding
angled frames, a state-of-the-art lighting system projects scenes - from
Dublin life to sung scenes from Aida - that mingle with the action on stage.
But the medium The Risen People most brings to mind is film, not opera, as
it appears to bring cinematic storytelling techniques to the stage.
Scenes overlap in a series of montages, plots and subplots mingle and
accumulate, character is revealed less through dialogue or symbolic action
than through behaviour.
The crucial element the Sheridans fail to provide is the camera, or its
stage equivalent. There is no dramatic focus to the action, no cues given to
the viewer on where to look or how to absorb the goings-on, and no gradation
between the intimate and grand-scale.
The Risen People tells the true story of the first organised labour uprising
in Ireland, in which 400 employers, led by William Martin Murphy, banded
together against a nascent union movement headed by the Englishman 'Big' Jim
Larkin.
Starvation and violence plagued the striking workers and their families, and
they were on the verge of admitting defeat when the conflict was
overshadowed by the outbreak of the first world war.
The Sheridan brothers first directed The Risen People, based on James
Plunkett's 1958 play of the same name on which he also based his
best-selling novel Strumpet City, in 1977 during their stint as artistic
directors of Dublin's Project Arts
Centre.
This production features some of the leading talents in Irish theatre -
Donal Donnelly and Johnny Murphy are in wizened good form, though Tom Hickey
looks to be marking time - as well as less seasoned performers.
David Herlihy makes a strong showing as Fitz, the young labour organiser,
but Lorraine Pilkington is out of her depth as his wife, Annie. It is her
Aida-like struggle between her love for Fitz
and her allegiance to her privileged father which is the ostensible reason
for the distracting and faintly ridiculous inclusion of portions of that
opera in the show.
The Risen People is the most expensive production in Irish theatre history,
with a budget estimated at IPounds 300,000 (Pounds 297,000)-IPounds 500,000.
Jim Sheridan is listed as producer as well as adaptor/director, so we can
assume that he has provided at least part of the funds from his film-making
profits.
Such reinvestment of film money back into theatre is an enlightened idea
that has taken hold in the US. It would be churlish not to applaud the
establishment of such a precedent in Ireland, but lax to do anything but
chide an artistic effort as sloppy as The Risen People.
The Risen People is playing at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, through November.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Intimacy in Festival Hall - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC Symphony Orchestra's concert on Saturday night was given as part of
the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik festival and under that rubric was
remarkable for turning the Festival Hall into a recording studio for radio
drama, notably Byron's Manfred as fitted out with music by Schumann.
But the second half seemed to round off the BBC's own 'Reinventing the
Orchestra' Berlioz series, comprising the romantisme of Berlioz's Harold in
Italy symphony in which the superb soloist was the Japanese viola player
Nobuko Imai. Two Romanticisms for the price of one, and that price the very
economical BBC tenner giving free access to the hall's main floor.
Thanks to this pricing policy, the BBC Symphony winter concerts are at last
gaining sensible audiences, and in more than one meaning of the word, for
those who turned up on Saturday were rewarded with very fine playing. The
Manfred overture and incidental music Op. 115 (1848) is a late work of
Schumann's seldom heard in its entirety, though the overture is familiar
enough. Given that Byron did not intend his verse drama to be staged - it is
typically Romantic theatre of the mind - and that Schumann's recension of it
is not obviously designed for performance whether as accompanied play,
dramatic cantata or opera manque, it is hard to see how Op. 115 can be
properly presented at all, still less establish itself.
For this performance Jeremy Sams arranged Schumann's reduction of Byron's
text as a telling sequence of gobbets spoken by three actors (whom he
directed) at the front of the platform, with the orchestra behind, the BBC
Symphony Chorus behind the players, and to stage-left a quartet of vocal
soloists representing the Four Spirits whom Manfred with his occult powers
invokes.
Philip Franks took the role of Manfred, the quasi-Faustian,
proto-Nietzschean restless spiritual voyager, with a passion and aplomb  -
the verse-line weighed with the most exacting care and given, where apt, a
ringing vehemence that never once seemed hollow - which threatened to
upstage the music. With his fellow actors David Firth and Maria Friedman, he
created a vivid dramatic immediacy remarkable in so large a hall.
Schumann wrote no more music for the play than would probably have been
commissioned by a radio producer, but his score contains some delightful
inventions. The overture holds a gentle air of mystery and foreboding and
was skilfully balanced by conductor Andrew Davis, whose placing of the
double basses at the rear opposite him had a subtly beneficial effect here
and throughout the concert.
The orchestral accompaniment to Manfred's speech hailing the Witch of the
Alps has a quicksilver quality rare in Schumann, more common in Mendelssohn;
while in the bleakly unwinding violin melody for the invocation of Astarte's
ghost was a distinct if unlikely pre-echo of Shostakovich.
After such an enterprising event the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra's Festival
Hall concert under its colourfully gestural chief conductor Kazushi Ono the
following night seemed a routine affair.
Strauss's Don Juan and Ravel's Daphnis and Chloe second suite showed that
this orchestra can do the big banging tutti with the best of them, and show
off the feathery delicacy too; but the crucial middle range of textural and
dynamic gradation was scamped.
Prokofiev's second violin concerto got an unenlivening performance from
soloist Raphael Oleg; and Masataka Matsuo's Phonosphere 1 for Kifu
Mitsuhashi's shakuhachi (bamboo flute) and orchestra (1993) was a highly
accomplished exercise in cultural synthesis that left me cold.

Three cheers for Channel 4 and television's best culture commentary series,
Without Walls, which begins a new run with a programme I would have said was
impossible on today's politically correct television in Britain: Sun TV
critic Gary Bushell, who is nobody's fool but decidedly right wing, argues
in favour of Alf Garnett, the monstrous working class Tory bigot who made
Till Death Us Do Part such a huge success in the 1960s. Bushell extends the
argument to criticise the stranglehold achieved by Islington trendies over
so much of television these days (9.00). We shall need our VCRs since the
fifth episode in BBC2's odd but endearing, and wholly engrossing, drama
series, Takin' Over The Asylum, also begins at 9.00. I still think the
attitude towards mental patients is sentimental, but perhaps that was
necessary. BBC1 begins a new series of 'factual dramas', Against All Odds,
containing testimony from the real protagonists woven into the scripts.
Today's story tells how Linda McNeill went to Turkish Cyprus to snatch her
three children from her violent husband (9.30).

FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Youthful expertise discovered - Wexford Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many leading composers have written journeyman operas which we never hear -
youthful efforts, or tame, ineffectual ones, or unstageable mistakes. The
intrepid Wexford Festival has tried on perhaps two or three of those, but it
wisely prefers obscure operas with some dramatic spark worth fanning.
Young Wagner's Das Liebesverbot ('The ban on love') is another case
altogether: a sparky, vital piece which happened to be composed before
Wagner had learned to be Wagner.
Had it been by, say, Goetz, it might have had a secure little niche in the
repertoire these many years. Wagner wrote it at 21; it had a single, ruinous
performance and no other in his lifetime. His successes with Rienzi and The
Flying Dutchman were soon to come, and after that a revival of his juvenile
comedy would have been beside the point. (He did later make a gift of the
score to King Ludwig, deprecating it as a 'Jugendsunde', a youthful sin.)
The fact is that hardly anything in Das Liebesverbot betrays the mature
composer; and yet it has the expertise, the pace and even the artful
characterisations of a thorough professional. Lessons from Meyerbeer and
Auber had been well learned.
The piece is drawn from Shakespeare's Measure from Measure: brashly, for
everything problematic or disturbing in that 'dark comedy' has been
heedlessly jettisoned. Das Liebesverbot simply waves a banner for youthful
love and lust against hypocritical moralising - especially Teutonic
moralising, as Wagner stressed by transferring the action to a hedonistic
Sicily, and turning Shakespeare's baneful Angelo into Friedrich, the German
Regent.
At Wexford the conductor Yves Abel strikes sparks from the start, with a
crackling operetta-dash. In no time at all Luzio, Antonio and Angelo (a
different one]) are embattled with the Bill, who want to tear down the
carnival decorations. Soon we recognise Claudio and his pious sister
Isabella (Peter Svensson and Marie Plette - both excellent), the one
threatened with death for the crime of falling in love (or something like
that) and the other - secretly - with having to grant Friedrich her favours
to save her brother.
In due course Friedrich himself appears, in the properly heavy, brooding
person of Robert Holzer.
In his dark music lie almost the only hints of the Wagner to come - a touch
of Tannhauser, to add to the simple pre-echoes of Lohengrin. But he has
strong competition from the comics: an exuberant, stentorian Police Chief
(Gidon Saks), a pert maid Dorella (Majella Cullagh), the eccentric Pontio
Pilato (Valentin Jar).
And the climax of the piece is the wild carnival, thriftily staged by Dieter
Kaegi with everybody in their underwear and some exiguous masks, at the end
of which they all - even Isabella, and a contrite Friedrich  - find somebody
to marry at once.
I must also mention the cool, attractive mezzo Marit Sauramo as Friedrich's
forsaken wife Mariana, who holds the key to the denouement. Even then, there
are other singers who deserve warm notice; but it will have to suffice to
insist that this bright, fleet comedy (judiciously trimmed to make it
swifter still) is another clear Wexford hit, well-aimed and irresistibly
carried through.
Perhaps after all, Das Liebesverbot may now come to slip into the repertoire
as a rewarding Wagnerian sport, with the hearty welcome it deserves.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: French monopolies in insemination
approved - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court has ruled that regulations governing bovine insemination
centres in France do not infringe Treaty of Rome competition or free
movement of goods rules.
The Court said that rules applicable to monopolies permit approved
insemination centres to be granted certain exclusive rights within a defined
geographical area. Charging customers for the additional costs actually
incurred when insemination centres were requested to supply semen from other
member countries did not constitute abuse of their dominant position.
Moreover, the free movement rules and stock-breeding directives did not
preclude national rules requiring EC semen importers to deliver imports to
an approved centre.
The rulings were given in response to two questions referred by the French
Court of Cassation in proceedings between the Crespelle insemination centre
and the Mayenne production and insemination co-operative.
The Crespelle centre had operated bovine semen storage units and carried out
insemination in part of the Mayenne Department since 1961. The Mayenne
co-operative, which had exclusive rights under French rules since 1970 in
the Mayenne Department, brought proceedings to enforce its exclusive rights
against Crespelle.
Artificial insemination in France is regulated by a 1966 law on stock
breeding which requires insemination centres to be authorised and to operate
in a defined area with a local geographical monopoly. Any breeder within the
area may request the local insemination centre to supply semen from
production centres of their choice, but must pay the additional costs
thereby incurred.
French rules require an importer from another EC country to deliver the
semen to an approved centre, but he may build up a stock in a centre of his
choice. EC directives cover insemination regulation but not yet the storage
or use of semen in the country of import.
The ECJ first referred to the treaty rule which subjects businesses granted
exclusive rights by member countries to the Rome treaty rules, including the
competition rules. The Court said that the French rules granted exclusive
rights to the insemination centres and created a dominant position by
establishing a contiguous series of local monopolies covering France.
However, the Court confirmed that such national rules are prohibited only
if, in merely exercising the exclusive right granted, the insemination
centre cannot avoid abusing its dominant position. Since the alleged abuse
in the present case was the charging of exorbitant prices by the centres,
and that was not the direct consequence of national law, the law alone did
not lead the centres to charge disproportionate costs and abuse their
dominant position.
Where a business has an administrative monopoly, it will abuse its dominant
position itself if it charges for its services fees which are
disproportionate to the economic value of the service provided. According to
the ECJ, there was no abuse provided the additional costs charged by the
centres were actually incurred in meeting their customers' requests to
supply imported semen.
The ECJ went on to find that the French storage rules for imported semen
were a barrier to imports. The treaty, however, allows restrictions if
justified on grounds of protection of the health and life of humans and
animals.
Although EC directives cover certain aspects of insemination regulation,
France argued that its rules were justified on public health grounds
relating to the need to improve bovine stock geneticity. The Court found
that the storage or use of semen in the country of import was not covered by
the directives. Member countries, therefore, could rely on health grounds to
restrict the free movement of bovine semen, provided the restrictive effects
on intra-Community trade did not exceed what was necessary to achieve the
aim in view.
The obligation to store semen in approved centres was found to apply without
distinction to domestic and imported goods. However, the ECJ said it could
not be ruled out that the restrictive effects on imports impeded the
marketing of imported semen more than national products. Since there were no
provisions preventing the centres applying unreasonable conditions or prices
for storage, it was a question of fact for the national court to decide
whether the operation of the approved centres amounted in practice to
discrimination against imports.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Long arm of US regulations - Terry
Calvani on draft guidelines for the application of antitrust laws abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY CALVANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The application of American antitrust, or competition, laws outside the US
has long been a source of friction between the US and its trading partners.
The international business community has suffered from not knowing how far
US regulators will go in asserting jurisdiction over anti-competitive
conduct outside US borders.
In spite of guidelines issued by previous US administrations, and several
attempts to clarify the issue in the US Supreme Court, that uncertainty not
only remains but appears to have increased.
Ten days ago, the Clinton administration at long last published its draft
Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations. The new
guidelines should be of interest to business executives, trade associations
and their lawyers as an indication of the current administration's
intentions to enforce US antitrust laws abroad.
Since this raises the prospect of foreign nationals being prosecuted by US
authorities for anti-competitive conduct that takes place outside the US and
that is legal in their home country, it involves delicate questions of law
and public policy. Though the guidelines are only in draft form, they are
important.
Although the guidelines address numerous issues, the extraterritorial
application of US antitrust law is the centrepiece.
Assertion of US antitrust laws abroad has had a tortuous and controversial
history. In 1909, the US Supreme Court ruled that the legality of conduct
must be determined by the law of the place where it occurred. This
'presumption of territoriality' was relied on by US courts to determine the
reach of Federal legislation until 1945 when, in the Aluminum Co of America
(Alcoa) case, the Supreme Court adopted what became known as the 'effects
test'. The justices ruled the US may impose liability on persons not within
its allegiance for conduct that took place outside its borders if it has an
effect within the US.
This statement of the law was adopted by the US courts and ultimately
refined into the principle that any conduct having a direct, substantial and
reasonably foreseeable effect on US commerce is subject to US jurisdiction.
The 'effects test' is now embraced by many governments and the European
Union.
The new guidelines assert US jurisdiction over foreign cartels (two or more
companies which collude to fix prices or divide markets) that make
substantial sales into the US. It does not matter if the cartel is wholly
located outside the US, administered by foreign nationals and is legal in
its home country. It does not matter if the cartel does not sell directly
into the US, but through intermediaries, or if the price of its goods into
the US is lower than the 'competitive price', which would benefit US
consumers. And it does not matter if it is a buyer cartel seeking lower
prices.
In keeping with recent cases against Japanese companies, the guidelines
assert jurisdiction over wholly foreign cartels where there is not even a
price effect within the US, but where the US government substantially funds
the purchase of goods or services consumed abroad. Thus foreign cartel
activity associated, for example, with a US Agency for International
Development project abroad may be subject to US antitrust jurisdiction.
Embracing a change of policy made under the Bush administration, the new
guidelines also assert jurisdiction over cartels that restrict US export
opportunities. This would capture combinations of foreign companies
(including trade associations) that adopt standards that hinder the ability
of US companies to export their products.
In the context of mergers, the guidelines assert jurisdiction over the
merger of two foreign companies, neither of which has a subsidiary or
productive assets in the US, but which make sales into the US. While the
prospect of dealing with several merger authorities may warm the hearts of
competition lawyers, business executives may be less enthusiastic.
The guidelines are also important for what they do not say.
Previous international guidelines were an excellent repository of guidance
on, for example, how the US government would assess the competitive
consequences of joint ventures - domestic as well as foreign. Similarly,
they contained the best analysis of the government's views on assessing
concentration among competitors at auctions.
While it is arguable that these provisions were not unique to transnational
issues and belonged elsewhere, their absence from the new international
guidelines leaves business executives and their lawyers without guidance.
Does the rescission of the previous guidelines and the failure of the new
ones to address these issues signal a change of policy on joint venture
analysis?
The curious thing about the guidelines is not their content. On the issue of
the extraterritorial application of antitrust laws, the guidance is simply
the 'effects test' writ large. The puzzle is why the US wants to convey the
message at all.
Under US law it is permissible to abduct foreign nationals from their own
countries, take them back to the US and put them on trial for offences under
US law which took place abroad. Assuming that such a law is appropriate and
generally would not be found offensive, it would be curious to see the US
government trumpeting the virtues of such a policy. Such laws, it might be
expected, would be employed sparingly and only where there was a strong
national interest at stake that warranted the compromise of another nation's
sovereignty.
While there is nothing within the new guidelines that is at odds with an
aggressive application of the 'effects test', one might question whether the
prominent proclamation of the guidelines is consistent with a friction-free
system of international antitrust co-operation.
The timing of the new guidelines is also curious. It is no secret that the
Clinton administration would like to see more international agreements that
facilitate US antitrust investigations abroad. The recently enacted
International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act 1994 would further that
objective. These guidelines would seem to undermine that effort. It is
unlikely that foreign trade departments will view them as an early Christmas
present.
Indeed, many may wonder whether the new US guidelines signal a renewed
interest in the jingoistic application of US antitrust abroad, and should be
met with opposition rather than co-operation. The draft guidelines should
provoke interesting responses.

Edward Pickard, who was finance director of Invergordon Distillers until
soon after it was taken over a year ago by Whyte &amp; Mackay, has become a
non-executive director of Macallan-Glenlivet, the quoted company which
produces the Macallan, one of the better known single malt whiskies.
Invergordon drew its success from own label brands for supermarkets. In
April, Chris Greig, who was Invergordon's chief executive, became a
non-executive director of William Grant &amp; Sons, the family-owned producer of
Glenfiddich, the UK's leading single malt.
Pickard, 49, came to the whisky industry after spells as finance director of
Wiggins Teape and as finance manager with John Menzies. At Invergordon he
was involved in floating the company in 1990, and then in holding off Whyte
&amp; Mackay (part of American Brands) in 1991, before it succumbed last year.

FT  25 OCT 94 / People: Bayfield takes a seat on British Bus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Bayfield, 40, a partner in accountants Robson Rhodes, has decided to
jump aboard British Bus to help Britain's biggest privately-owned bus
company acquire even more bus companies.
Bayfield, who works in Robson Rhodes' corporate finance team, has been
advising British Bus on aspects of corporate strategy and finance since
plans were mooted to separate British Bus from National Express in 1992.
Gordon Watt, 41, British Bus's deputy chief executive, is also a former
partner in Robson Rhodes and was keen to recruit another finance man.
British Bus, whose interests range from Derby City Transport to Midland Fox
and Crosville Wales, has more than doubled in size since its management
buy-out in December 1992. It has 4,300 buses, a staff of 9,000 and turnover
of Pounds 250m a year. It raised Pounds 35m of equity from Charterhouse and
CINVen in May and has also increased its bank borrowings substantially to
finance a steady stream of acquisitions.
Watt's formula for successful acquisitions is 'to buy the revenue and cut
costs'. He believes that the combination of predictable cash flows,
substantial capital investment and small need for working capital, means
that bus companies can be much more highly geared and should start being
regarded as akin to utilities. Although Watt says that the City does not
'fully appreciate the cash-generative nature of the bus business', British
Bus has been able to finance a hectic acquisition spree and its appetite
shows no sign of abating.
Whether British Bus will turn into the modern-day equivalent of the old
British Electric Traction company which once dominated Britain's bus
industry, will depend partly on Bayfield, who will be responsible for group
and acquisitions strategy. One of his first tasks will be to help decide
when the time is ripe for British Bus to seek a stock market listing for its
shares.

CRH, the Irish building materials group, has appointed Liam O'Mahony as
chief executive of Oldcastle Inc, the group's US operations. The move is
part of a number of top management changes forced on the company following
the death of chairman Des Traynor in June.
O'Mahony, 48, is currently managing director of CRH's Irish and UK
operations. A civil engineer by background, he should be 'well acquainted',
according to a CRH director, with the US operations; he worked as chief
operating officer of Oldcastle in the 1980s, when Don Godson, CRH's new
chief executive, was running the US subsidiary.
O'Mahony's old job has been split, with Brian Griffin appointed managing
director of the Irish operations, and Les Tench managing director of CRH
Britain.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Survival mission / A look
at the rescue service provided by a large practice of company doctors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Miller family set up Prestwick Holdings in 1969, it had a simple
strategy - to be among the leading mass producers of printed circuit boards
for electronics assemblers in Europe.
The company prospered for most of the years leading up to flotation in 1985.
But since then Prestwick has stumbled though management changes, a boardroom
coup and a collapse in profits that has left its shares languishing at less
than half the issue price.
It might have been worse, however, without the intervention of Postern, the
UK's only specialist corporate rescue service that brings a number of
company doctors together in one organisation.
Headed by chairman Sir Lewis Robertson, a respected administrator and a
chairman of several companies which have been rescued, Postern attempts to
be fireman, resuscitation unit and convalescent home rolled into one.
Its work at Prestwick bore fruit in July when, seven months after being
appointed by the Millers and other shareholders, new management seconded
from Postern orchestrated a Pounds 4.5m rights issue that patched up a
battered balance sheet.
But the bruising year spent appeasing mercurial banks and lurching from
crisis to crisis vividly illustrates how company rescues rarely progress in
a predictable fashion.
'Most of our companies are absolutely at death's door and facing closure
when we start,' says Archie Coulson, the Postern director who heads the
rescue team and is now chairman at Prestwick. 'But recovery is not a
straight line, it's a very jagged path.'
Normally Postern is called in by banks trying to prevent a company they have
backed from going down in flames. But in the case of Prestwick - which is
slightly smaller than the two largest UK independents, Exacta and ISL, both
unquoted companies with sales of about Pounds 40m each - it was the Miller
family that appealed for help.
The family's action was prompted by disquiet about the diversification
strategy adopted by the then management in 1992, by which time no Millers
were on the board despite their 25 per cent shareholding.
The move that upset Eric Miller, brother of the co-founder and former
director, was Prestwick's Pounds 2m investment in Electroconnect, a designer
of PCB prototypes bought the previous year.
'Prestwick had negligible profits and the balance sheet was very stretched
with 100 per cent gearing,' says Miller. 'Debt was not being whittled down.
It was suggested we talk to Lewis Robertson at Postern.'
With the support of another shareholder bloc, Postern was appointed in early
January this year and three Prestwick directors left the board.
As always when Postern goes into a company, its first almost obsessional
interest is with cash. 'We sit with the internal cash manager and produce a
schedule that says line by line what the facility position is,' says
Coulson. The focus is the cash book and how much 'headroom' there is between
this and the banks' facility limits.
Very soon after he got his feet under the table Coulson had his first shock.
Understandably, one of Coulson's first calls was on the regional manager of
the Royal Bank of Scotland, Prestwick's main lenders. Coulson says this
manager was 'pleased to see the cavalry coming over the hill' and welcomed
Postern on board.
It was therefore a surprise to Coulson in early February when at a routine
meeting with the Royal Bank he was met by three executives from the special
lending service - a euphemism for the loan recovery unit. Concerned with the
security on its Pounds 3.8m facility, the Royal Bank dropped the bombshell
that it would be appointing investigating accountants, Ernst &amp; Young, at
Prestwick. Coulson was aware these reports often lead to accountants
recommending receivership.
'We went in thinking they (the Royal Bank) would be happy to support this
restructuring,' says Coulson. Suddenly that support was in doubt. It
reinforces one of Coulson's rules of restructuring: 'The trick is not to
allow yourself, or more importantly the banks, to have any nasty surprises.'
In the event, Ernst &amp; Young produced a report that said the operational
management could build a future for Prestwick and that Postern was
addressing the issues.
One of the next significant problems was the rights issue. It was clear the
company needed to be recapitalised and that Prestwick had a poor track
record. To make matters worse, Coulson was bereft of advisers. Prestwick's
brokers, Glasgow-based Speirs and Jeffrey, decided it could not back the
rights issue; Prestwick was in arrears on dividend payments for a preference
share issue the broker supported.
At the same time, and quite coincidentally, Prestwick's lawyer moved from
his firm, McGrigor Donald, leaving the company deciding whether to follow
him or bring a new partner quickly up to speed at the old firm.
Finally, Noble Grossart, the investment bank which as Prestwick's long-time
adviser had been associated with the old management and failed strategy, was
still evaluating the Postern management. 'How was I to do a rights issue?'
asked Coulson. 'In terms of advisers I was a bit thin on the ground.'
Meanwhile, Prestwick was facing ordinary operational problems. In
particular, one large customer had started questioning the quality of PCBs
it was receiving.
What seemed like a 'king-size' problem at a critical juncture of the
restructuring, however, turned out to be a financial issue. After checking
on the quality, Coulson realised the customer was as concerned about
Prestwick's finances as its ability to deliver quality products.
'The important thing in a recovery is you have to make sure you fire fight
those issues on time before the customer says 'we don't know what these
people are doing, we will get another supplier',' Coulson says.
Postern finally persuaded brokers Allied Provincial Services to support the
rights issue. But in a chaotic eight weeks Prestwick first had to sell a
subsidiary, appoint Paul Woodley as new finance director, develop a new
business plan, produce acceptable interim figures and appoint a new board.
By the time Prestwick produced preliminary figures in the year to August 1,
which showed the company had returned to operating profits in the second
half, Postern had won the time to consider its future.
Coulson believes there are a number of options, including vertical
integration through the forging of links with a raw material supplier or
equipment manufacturer. With the renewed shareholder support, merger with or
acquisition of another PCB manufacturer is also likely to be carefully
studied.
Routine operational problems nevertheless persist. The latest, alluded to in
the interim results statement, concerns a shortfall in capacity utilisation
in the multi-layer PCB plant. 'The underlying problem is the operational
gearing ratio of these big plants,' Coulson says. 'It does not take a big
swing in orders to go from profits to losses.'
Postern meets similar problems at each of the companies it works with -
about half of which are private. The lessons learned in such situations are
discussed extensively at regular meetings of Postern's six-member executive
committee.
This committee not only includes Coulson and Sir Lewis, but Ken Scobie,
former chief executive of Brent Walker, Stan Carslake, former head of
Barclays Bank Intensive Care Unit, and Trevor Swete, former head of
corporate finance at Hill Samuel.
These meetings will rake over issues ranging from capacity utilisation
problems, such as those at Prestwick, to pricing and brand strategy and how
to deal with banks.
'We have gathered together a load of information on how we crack issues in
the field,' says Coulson. 'A lot is to do with good basic management. But by
making Postern a company, we systematically put together the cumulative
experience of all these guys. That is our real value.'

The value of company voluntary arrangements as a rescue tool is not fully
understood by a large number of accountants, bankers and solicitors,
according to accountants Levy Gee.
Lack of familiarity with the procedures means many businesses are failing
that could actually be saved, the firm says.
Levy Gee draws these conclusions from a survey of 700 bankers, solicitors
and accountants which was conducted in the south of England.
CVAs are an arrangement between a company and its creditors to rehabilitate
a company and enable it to attract new money.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): GLE back in black with
Pounds 1.9m profit - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater London Enterprise, the development agency owned by 13 London
boroughs which has been restructuring for two years, last week reported
profits of Pounds 1.9m in the year to 31 March, compared with a loss of
Pounds 2m the previous year.
Nearly half the operating profit came from the investments made by its
venture capital arm, GLE Development Capital, using the group's own funds.
These investments are slowly being liquidated.
But GLE Development Capital earlier this year raised Pounds 3.5m from the
pension fund of the London Borough of Newham to bring funds under management
to Pounds 13.5m.
Mark Wignall, GLE Development Capital managing director, says the fund will
invest as little as Pounds 100,000, although companies backed at this level
will have to accept that up to a quarter of the money raised could be
swallowed up in fees.
The group remains one of the few sources of small amounts of equity for
London-based companies, according to Wignall.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): High-tech firms should
get support - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is being urged to formulate a policy that will encourage the
start-up of high-technology and knowledge-based companies, following
research into the fortunes of such businesses over a six-year period.
Professor David Storey, director of the small- and medium-sized enterprise
centre at Warwick University, says there is clear evidence that high-tech
companies grow more quickly than other start-ups.
More surprisingly, says Storey, their survival rate is significantly higher
than that of typical small businesses.
The findings emerge from a study* of the performance of high-tech companies
within and outside the UK's science parks between 1986 and 1992, co-authored
by Storey. It shows that knowledge-based companies attached to science parks
grew slightly more quickly than similar companies elsewhere.
The on-park companies also grew more quickly in terms of the number of
people employed. However, being based on or off the park makes no difference
to a company's chances of survival.
Storey says the study suggests the government must make a more robust effort
to support high-tech start-ups. 'I am normally strongly opposed to
supporting start-ups,' he says. 'But high-tech start-ups are very important
for the long-term development of the British economy.'
According to the report, the government should also consider how to
encourage the development of more science-based entrepreneurs. It shows that
nearly half the founders of high-tech companies had a higher degree in a
science-based subject.
'The single most important issue is that the supply of these potential
entrepreneurs has to be supplemented,' the report says.
The UK Science Park Association estimates nearly 412 companies employed
5,300 staff on UK science parks in 1986, when the study started. Seven years
later there were 1,188 science park companies which between them employed
nearly 20,000 people.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: An eye on the crops
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Satellite technology is being harnessed to help farmers plant crops, but
satellites are also being employed by governments as their spy in the sky to
check what producers have planted and whether they are cheating on their
claims for European Union subsidies.
All EU governments, except Luxembourg, are using satellite imagery to ensure
that producers' claim forms for farm support match up with what is on the
ground. With more than Pounds 28bn in subsidies at stake, remote sensing has
become an integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Interpreting satellite imagery to distinguish which crops have been planted
and the extent of farmers' holdings has improved rapidly over the years.
Four years ago, it was used on a purely experimental basis, but this year
most EU members have harnessed it as a vital tool in tracking fraud.
Neil Pattie at the National Remote Sensing Centre in Farnborough, which has
the contract for checking UK producers, says each crop has its own
'fingerprint' on an infra-red image. A computer interprets these
'fingerprints' to produce a map marked with different colours. Oilseed rape,
for example, is pink, in contrast to its bright yellow hue in the field.
'Our job is to flag up discrepancies between the information included on
farmers' claim forms and the crop on the ground,' he says. Producers will
not be penalised on satellite imagery alone - the Ministry of Agriculture
will send a local inspector to look at farms where anomalies appear.
Pattie is not allowed to reveal how much fraud his system uncovers but cites
a 'small but significant number of discrepancies'.
An official from the National Farmers' Union in Brussels points out that
some of the satellite images have been so good they have shown up farm
management details. For example, one farmer had not applied herbicide to
rape crops and the images showed the spread of poppies in the field.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: Farmers from outer space / A look at the role
satellites can play in predicting crop yields
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Fenton, an arable farmer in north Humberside, can pinpoint which parts
of his 400-hectare holding make him the most money. He could be accurate in
his predictions of crop yields down to a metre but mostly he measures the
amount of grain harvested every rsix metres.
He can achieve this precision by using US navigational satellites in orbit
12,000 miles above the earth, which beam down to mark his exact location in
a particular field. From the data collected on his fields, Fenton can build
up a yield map of his entire farm.
'We've all known there are variations in crop yields across the field in the
past, but this allows you to be much more specific about what you're doing,'
he says.
The satellite technology used by Fenton is not new, but its application to
agriculture is being pioneered by Massey Ferguson, the agriculture machinery
makers.
'It's a massive breakthrough to apply this to farming because it means you
can manage different parts of the field differently and adapt your inputs of
chemicals, seed and fertilisers accordingly,' says Chris Dawson, a
consultant who has worked with farmers applying the technique.
Massey Ferguson is combining its yield meter in a combine harvester, which
measures the amount of grain harvested in each part of the field, with a
Global Positioning System which uses satellites to tell the machine exactly
where it is. Data collected in this way over several years can highlight
vast differences in productivity between areas in the same field.
Dawson says that yields may vary by 50 per cent above or below the average
across a field. This means farmers could see a yield of 3 1/2 tonnes of
grain per hectare in one section of the field and as much as 10 tonnes in
another part.
By pinpointing areas of the field with low yields, producers can take a
closer look at them, for example analysing soil samples to see if the pH
needs adjusting. They can also vary applications of chemicals and
fertilisers.
'Some of the variability in yield will be attributable to factors such as
acidity or poor drainage over which we have control,' says Dawson.
'But some of it might relate to depth of the soil or just the nature of the
soil itself.'
At this point, the farmer has to take a management decision about whether
the poorer parts of his land will respond to increased use of fertilisers or
chemicals or whether they just have intrinsically lower potential.
'There are parts of our fields that will never ever yield as much as 10
tonnes per hectare - our target yield. If you cut back on applications to
those parts of the field, you can save a lot of money,' Fenton explains.
Fenton is farming on extremely fertile soil which makes his target yield a
lot higher than average.
Using computer programs, a farmer can draw up a map for applying chemicals
or seeds. That map can be fed on disk or smart card into a control unit on a
conventional tractor or sprayer so that the machine automatically applies
more or less seed or spray depending on where it is in the field.
Brian Welti, farm manager at Shuttleworth College Farm in Bedfordshire,
planted Britain's first field of winter wheat earlier this month using a
seed map developed from the yield mapping system. The navigational
satellites told the machine exactly where the more productive areas in the
field were and it automatically varied seed applications depending on its
location.
By applying fewer seeds, chemicals or fertilisers to poor parts of the land,
the farmer can make considerable savings as well as farm in a more
environmentally friendly way.
'The environmental benefits are very very substantial. Before, we applied
everything in a blanket fashion, and now we can target applications,' says
Fenton.
He has reduced the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil by 30 per cent and
managed to cut the amount of nitrogen leaching from the soil by 60 per cent
without losing yield. He targets the positioning of phosphate and potash
fertilisers in direct proportion to the higher-yielding parts of the land.
In some respects, this technology is enabling farmers to produce in the same
way as they did 30 years ago when their land was divided into much smaller
fields. All of the fields had different characteristics and were dealt with
individually.
But the drive for more efficient, large-scale farming, led to many farmers
ripping out hedges in the 1970s and creating fields covering tens of
hectares which would then be treated as one unit.
Fenton and Welti are two of 30 farmers currently using Massey Ferguson's
equipment in the UK, but trials are also under way in Germany and Denmark as
well as the US. Fenton believes the technology could be suitable for any
arable farmer who wants to manage his business in a more precise way but, at
the moment, the cost of the equipment could put off some producers.
The Global Positioning System, which can be moved into any piece of
machinery, costs Pounds 11,500, but farmers need to have yield meters in
their combine harvesters and computers for producing the maps.
Fenton believes that the savings offered by using the equipment can quickly
repay its cost. For example, he has changed the way he cultivates oilseed
rape as a result of the yield map and has subsequently reduced his costs
from Pounds 26 a tonne to Pounds 9 a tonne.
'It has given me a wealth of information I wouldn't otherwise have had and
has totally changed my farming technique,' he says.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: Coming up with the write stuff - A new product
which reads handwriting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A software package that dramatically improves the ability of computers to
recognise handwritten characters has been devised by California-based Palm
Computing.
Called Graffiti, the package takes a different approach to earlier attempts
at handwriting recognition by teaching users to write characters in a unique
way. The software recognises them and translates them into computer text.
Palm says Graffiti achieves 100 per cent character recognition - a feat
other systems cannot come close to matching - after a short time spent by
the user learning the required characters.
The software could boost sales of small, hand-held computers, called
personal digital assistants. PDA sales have so far failed to meet the levels
predicted by market analysts a year ago. They have floundered partly because
of their disappointing performance in recognising handwritten text, which
users enter using a special stylus instead of a keyboard.
Producing PDAs that can recognise handwritten characters has proved a
punishing challenge. Apple Computer promised that its Newton MessagePad
could recognise complete words. But it took users considerable time and
effort to teach the Newton to recognise their handwriting, and even then the
device often misread the text.
Graffiti presents users with a box measuring 1 sq in on the computer display
screen, into which they write single letters one after another; each new
letter overwrites the last, and appears in computer text on the PDA screen.
Most characters are written in a way very similar to that in which most
people write already, but seven characters, including the letters 'k' and
'a' are written slightly differently to minimise confusion between letters
and numbers.
According to Kimball Brown, analyst at market research firm Dataquest: 'It
basically teaches people how to write so that the PDA will recognise their
characters, instead of trying to teach the PDA how to recognise a wide
variety of different handwriting.'
The software also allows users to enter large blocks of text, such as
commonly used phrases, by writing a two-character abbreviation.
Ed Colligan, vice-president of marketing at Palm Computing, says the time it
takes to learn the system will be 'more than compensated for by the
increased capabilities Graffiti provides'.
Palm is encouraged by the results of focus groups involving 80 users, in
which more than 90 per cent of Newton and Tandy Zoomer PDA owners who tried
Graffiti said they would buy it.
The company claims several leading computer manufacturers plan to include
Graffiti with new PDAs and hand-held computers. But it says it will not sell
an exclusive licence to any single manufacturer. 'We see Graffiti as an
enabling technology. If it helps boost sales of PDAs and hand-held devices
everybody will benefit, and we can sell more of our other applications,'
explains Colligan.
Graffiti is also likely to be used in new types of pager. Since its screen
requirement is so small, leading pager manufacturers such as Motorola plan
to introduce products that will allow users to send short messages quickly
by writing on a small screen with a special stylus.
'Graffiti is a significant technology breakthrough which enables development
of pocket-sized devices with robust data input capabilities,' says Doug
Brackbill, vice-president at US-based wireless communications firm Mobile
Telecommunication Technologies.
Graffiti recognises all Roman-alphabet characters and Greek mathematical
symbols. Palm is working on a Japanese version, and hopes Graffiti will
become an industry standard.
In the US Graffiti costs Dollars 79 (Pounds 50) and is available in versions
for the Apple Newton, Tandy Zoomer and AST GridPad. A version for PDAs based
on General Magic's Magic Cap and Microsoft WinPad systems is forthcoming.
The product will be available from European suppliers in the next few weeks.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Aquittal: Bloodied but unbowed and heading
home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bloodied, bruised, but back in business - that was how Mr George Walker
described himself after his acquittal yesterday.
At a hastily-arranged press conference opposite the courtroom where he has
spent the last 4 1/2 months he was too exhausted to be in celebratory mood.
The former head of Brent Walker said: 'I am relieved, but I don't feel like
celebrating. There has been too much tension, particularly for my family.'
He made it clear, however, that he did not see a quiet retirement ahead.
Although 65 years old and with 18 months of a bankruptcy order to serve, he
said that he still had friends in business prepared to make offers.
'I haven't thought a lot about it, but I have had a lot of support from
friends in the business community. I do think I have something to give. I
know my business - the leisure sector,' he said.
Mr Walker still feels deeply angry about losing the company he built up from
a modest chain of petrol stations in the 1950s.
The history of Brent Walker has been written many times. From managing the
boxing career of his brother Billy, to opening 'Billy's Baked Potato' shops
in the 1960s, Mr George Walker moved into the leisure sector, running clubs
and restaurants.
Property deals were to follow - notably the development of the Brent Cross
shopping centre after which the company's name was coined.
Throughout its history Brent Walker was always synonymous with Mr Walker.
His tough management style became a City byword.
It was in the boom years of the 1980s that the company made the big time.
The development of Brighton Marina and the Trocadero centre in London's West
End were two of the projects which put Mr Walker at centre stage.
The company was always heavily borrowed and this was to prove his downfall
after the Pounds 685m purchase of the William Hill chain of bookmaking shops
in 1990.
The markets turned against him and, unable to raise money by selling
property in a falling market, Mr Walker had to arrange a Pounds 100m bond
issue to save the company. He put Pounds 30m of his own and his family's
money into the issue. This was not enough to satisfy his bankers, however.
The condition of their further financial support was for him to leave the
company.
Mr Walker yesterday repeated his criticisms of the banks. They had, he said,
reneged on promises of support for him by engineering his removal.
Everything from his removal to bankruptcy and prosecution was brought about
by the banks panicking.
'Their performance on this question needs a lot of thought. I hope somebody
will be looking at their way of acting,' he said.
He has started legal proceedings for unfair dismissal against Brent Walker.
These, he said, would continue.
Mr Walker may have put the criminal proceedings behind him, but he must
still deal with the consequences of being made bankrupt with debts totalling
some Pounds 180m.
At the time the High Court judge who ordered his bankruptcy questioned the
arrangements made with Mr Walker's wife Jean, which have left significant
sums out of the reach of creditors. He said Mr Walker's attitude to his
creditors had been 'cavalier'.
Mr Walker's only business at the moment is his Russian trading operation
which is involved in exporting cigarettes. The acquittal means he can now
rebuild a business career. Yesterday, however, he was not thinking beyond a
quiet family celebration. 'I am going to go home with my family, have dinner
and go to bed.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Acquittal: Debt-laden group with questions
to answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brent Walker's struggles against its mountain of debt have been dominant
since Mr George Walker's departure.
Lord Kindersley, appointed chairman in January 1991, expected a brief but
arduous tenure while the group was refinanced. But untangling Pounds 1.65bn
of debt owed to more than 50 banks occupied him seven days a week until
March 31 1992 - the last day agreed for a solution.
For more than a year the group was perilously poised between rescue and
receivership. The rescue was the biggest in UK corporate history, clocking
up fees of Pounds 53.8m.
To reach a settlement the group had to find a way around a Pounds 50m
payment due to Grand Metropolitan, the leisure group, which is the final
instalment of the Pounds 685m purchase price of bookmaker William Hill. That
matter has not been settled, with Brent Walker claiming a Pounds 200m refund
on the purchase price.
The group was left with two core businesses, its Pubmaster chain and William
Hill. With masterly understatement Lord Kindersley, announcing losses of
Pounds 411m for 1991, described the year as 'by any standard a most trying
year for the group'.
He left in July 1992 but it was not until January last year that a new
chairman was found - Sir Keith Bright.
The summer of 1993 saw the group breaching some of the terms of its
refinancing. It also faced the problem of refinancing the Pounds 350m
ringfenced loan on William Hill, which became the subject of a bid battle
between a consortium led by merchant bank SG Warburg and another led by
CinVEN and Legal and General.
Last December the banks agreed refinancing for William Hill. The deal left
borrowings at Pounds 1.4bn.
The 1993 loss, announced in May, was Pounds 319.1m. Mr John Leach, the
finance director, said the two core businesses were at last able to cover
interest.
Sir Keith quit as chairman in September, warning that turnover in the core
operations had shown 'little sign of an upturn'. He has been replaced by Sir
Brian Goswell, a non-executive director and a senior partner in Healey &amp;
Baker, estate agents and surveyors.
Meanwhile William Hill has become the main engine of the group, with
operating profits for the first half of Pounds 30.8m. But questions remain
over the bookmaker. Mr Leach said in September that flotation was still an
option, 'but not necessarily the only one'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / The George Walker Acquittal: Heavy blow for Serious Fraud
Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The acquittal of Mr George Walker, the former head of the Brent Walker
group, is a heavy blow for the Serious Fraud Office that has come at a
particularly sensitive time.
Its entire future is under consideration. The attorney general, Sir Nicholas
Lyell, will soon decide whether to wrap up the office in its current guise
and merge it into the Crown Prosecution Service - or to expand its size and
operations. His decision is expected within two months.
The perception of the office inside and outside the City will be crucial to
the politics of Sir Nicholas' decision. To expand the office would require
an expression of ministerial confidence. To place it under CPS control would
be seen by some as an admission that the original thinking behind the office
was misconceived.
Within the SFO there is common agreement that the forthcoming Maxwell trial
will be the ultimate test of its credibility. However, the failure of such a
high-profile case as Mr Walker's will undoubtedly make it more difficult for
Sir Nicholas to endorse the SFO's operations.
So after Blue Arrow and Mr Roger Levitt, what went wrong for the SFO this
time? Some defence lawyers complained the case was too large and, lasting 4
1/2 months, too long. However, at no stage in the trial did the prosecution
suffer any disastrous collapse of parts of its case. No witness gave
evidence which left its case fatally flawed.
The case was very dependent upon the jury following complicated flow-charts
which outlined the transfers of money. However, lawyers involved felt the
issues were put across clearly to the jury. The jury was told not to
consider one theft charge brought against Mr Walker, but this was considered
a minor setback. The prosecution's case appeared intact and the SFO's
lawyers were reasonably confident to the end.
The SFO's allegations were that Mr Walker had orchestrated the fraudulent
boosting of profits by some Pounds 19m between 1984 and 1989. He had done
this, it claimed, through bogus film rights transactions handled by the
Brent Walker film division.
The office alleged that effectively, Brent Walker was funding its own
profits and to cover this up the money transfers were disguised through a
complex laundering operation involving off-shore companies and family trusts
in the Bahamas and the Isle of Man.
The prosecution said this took place at a critical time - when the Brent
Walker group was expanding from being a medium-size company in the property
and leisure sector to becoming a big-time organisation. The fraud was
necessary, the prosecution claimed, to attract the support of investors and
banks which was necessary for the expansion.
Mr Walker's defence was robust. Giving evidence from the witness box for
more than a week, he repeatedly insisted he was innocent.
He denied the prosecution was correct in its insistence that the profits had
been inflated at all. Confronted with evidence of the money transfers, Mr
Walker maintained he had little or no personal involvement.
Mr Walker stressed repeatedly to the jury that he was the chairman and chief
executive of an extremely large and busy company. The transactions
complained of amounted to a mere fraction of his daily workload, he said.
Although he was involved in the principles of decision-taking about deals,
he left the detailed work to senior executives he trusted. If they brought
him documents to sign, he would do so without question, he said.
Two such executives featured largely in the trial - Mr John Quested, a
former managing director of the film division, and Mr Donald Anderson, the
subsidiary's former finance director. Both men had been accused by the
prosecution of being part of the conspiracy to falsify accounts. Mr Anderson
left the UK shortly before a warrant was issued for his arrest. His
whereabouts are still unknown.
Mr Walker himself expressed his trust and faith in the integrity of both
men. However, his lawyers, while still disputing that anything illegal had
taken place, nevertheless pointed the finger of any blame firmly in the
direction of Mr Quested and Mr Anderson.
One piece of evidence may have worked in Mr Walker's favour and helped
convince the jury of his innocence. One of the documents relating to the
alleged money laundering bore Mr Walker's signature. Mr Walker had
maintained from the start of the inquiry that this was a forgery. This was
confirmed during the trial by a hand-writing expert.
Those at the SFO involved will now re-examine their handling of the case to
try to establish where they might have gone wrong. The SFO was yesterday
making no official comment on the outcome, but those inside the office were
bracing themselves for another dousing in the cold water of bad publicity.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Tour group woos stay-at-homes: Thomson is promoting its
cottage industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Majorca, Florida and Tunisia are among the usual destinations promoted by
Thomson, the UK's largest holiday group. Last week, however, the company
launched its brochures for holidays in Ramsgate, Skipton and Blairgowrie.
While 23.5m Britons went abroad last year 32.5m took holidays in the UK.
Thomson, which owns the UK's largest overseas tour operator, charter airline
and travel agency, decided this summer that it could no longer ignore the
holidaymakers who stay at home.
In August it bought Country Holidays, the largest UK holiday cottage letting
company, for about Pounds 34m. The purchase could transform the holiday
industry, bringing sharper marketing and better distribution to a sector
that has traditionally been fragmented and poorly organised.
The overseas package holiday industry is dominated by three large companies,
Thomson, Airtours and First Choice. Statistics abound on who goes abroad,
where they stay and how much they spend.
In contrast, Mr Geoff Cowley, marketing manager of Country Holidays, says no
one can be sure of the size of the market for UK self-catering
accommodation. He estimates that about 4m people a year take holidays in
what the industry calls 'cottages', which can be anything from converted
barns to Scottish castles.
Country Holidays has 5,600 properties on its books. English Country
Cottages, the second largest company, has 2,800. Mr Cowley says Country
Holidays, which was founded in 1979, has not grown dramatically in recent
years, preferring to weed out poorer quality cottages and add better ones.
Mr Tim Fullam, English Country Cottages' marketing director, says, however,
that his company has grown rapidly, reflecting an increase in demand for
high-quality self-catering accommodation.
Founded in Norfolk in the mid-1970s to rent out a handful of cottages, the
company grew from 353 properties in 1980 to 1,329 in 1985. Since then it has
more than doubled in size.
Neither Country Holidays nor English Country Cottages owns any properties.
All the cottages on its books are owned by people who want to rent them out,
but do not have the time or experience to do their own marketing or
administration.
Instead the companies, for a small administration charge and a commission of
between 21 per cent and 25 per cent, include pictures and descriptions of
the properties in their brochures. The companies take the bookings and
collect the bills.
Mr Fullam said some cottage owners bought their properties as a second home
and wanted to rent them out in the weeks they were not using them. Others
bought them as an investment or as an eventual retirement home.
Some owners have several homes as part of a more substantial business. One
owner on the company's books has 20. Many are farmers who have converted
some of their buildings into holiday accommodation. One owner in Scotland
lives in a caravan and rents out his own home. Mr Fullam says many of the
properties, which are inspected at least once a year, have indoor heated
swimming pools - making unreliable weather less of a deterrent to those
thinking of taking UK holidays.
Although both companies say that English Country Cottages is the more
upmarket brand, their customer profiles are similar. The typical customer
for both companies is an ABC1 holidaymaker with children. The cost of a
Country Holidays cottage for six in Devon in August is Pounds 563 a week or
Pounds 93.83 a person.
Both companies say their customers do not generally take a UK holiday in
preference to a trip abroad. Many take two holidays, one at home and one
overseas.
Customers from abroad account for only 5 per cent of the two companies'
business. However, with a record 20m overseas visitors expected in the UK
this year, both companies are now actively marketing their cottages
overseas.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Howard hits at claims on Fayeds: Home secretary denies
intervention in citizenship application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, last night rejected claims that he
intervened in applications for British citizenship by Mr Mohamed Fayed and
his brother Ali, the owners of Harrods.
Mr Howard issued a statement after conferring with senior advisers to decide
whether to respond to press reports which suggested that he advised Mr
Charles Wardle, then the immigration minister, on how to handle Mr Ali
Fayed's application.
Labour said the statement failed to explain how the application came to Mr
Howard's attention, and suggested that it was in any case inappropriate for
Mr Wardle to have been the minister in charge.
Downing Street refused to comment on reports that Mr Howard's role had been
reviewed in an inquiry carried out by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary.
Mr Howard's statement did not say when he was made aware of Mr Ali Fayed's
application, and by whom. But it said he 'had made it clear from the outset'
that Mr Wardle should decide whether it was approved.
The statement followed pressure from opposition MPs for a Commons debate on
Mr Howard's role in processing the brothers' applications.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, said that Mr Howard's 'long-delayed
statement' raised fresh questions about the role of Mr Wardle, who had
previously criticised the Fayed brothers' acquisition of Harrods.
Mr Straw drew attention to a Commons speech by Mr Wardle in March 1990 which
was highly critical of the Department of Trade and Industry's failure to bar
the Fayeds from acting as company directors.
He said: 'Mr Howard says that the application was referred by officials to
his junior minister. How did he know this and what led him to make it clear
from the outset that the matter should be handled by Mr Wardle?'
Mr Straw added: 'In view of Mr Wardle's plain hostility to the Al-Fayeds,
has it ever been put to Mr Howard that it was inappropriate for Mr Wardle to
make a quasi-judicial decision in this case? That is the question I shall be
asking tomorrow in the Commons.'
The Liberal Democrats wrote to the government asking whether Mr Howard, then
corporate affairs minister, was involved in the DTI's 1987 decision to
examine the Fayeds' acquisition of Harrods.
Mr Howard yesterday obtained an extension of the interim high court
injunction he gained against the Financial Times on Friday preventing the
newspaper publishing 'certain allegations' about him.
Mr Andrew Gowers, the FT's deputy editor, said that the injunction
'apparently results from a misunderstanding of the line of inquiries the
paper was following on Friday. Its terms do not relate to any story we are
currently researching.'
The Home Office said Mr Howard had initiated the court action privately and
was responsible for his own legal fees.
Mr Mohamed Fayed last night accused the Home Office of 'slipping standards'
and 'discourtesy' by discussing his application with the media before
telling him its decision.

FT  25 OCT 94 / 'The extent of my personal involvement'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard last night issued this statement on the Fayed brothers'
naturalisation:
'In view of certain allegations concerning the handling of the
naturalisation applications by Mr Ali Al-Fayed and Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed, I
should like to put on record the extent of my personal involvement with
these applications.
'Naturalisation applications are normally decided by officials in the
nationality division of the Home Office, but especially difficult or
sensitive cases are referred to ministers, when they are usually dealt with
by the junior minister responsible for immigration and nationality.
Exceptionally cases are referred to the Home secretary.
'The application was referred by the head of the nationality division on
December 23 1993, to my then junior minister Charles Wardle. I had made it
clear from the outset to Mr Wardle that I wished the application of Mr Ali
Al-Fayed to be decided by him. Subsequently, on January 13, Mr Wardle's
office referred the papers to my office and indicated that he wished to
discuss the case with me and I saw him on January 21. I confirmed to Mr
Wardle that the decision on this application should be taken by him.
'The case next came to my attention on April 27 when Mr Wardle's office
referred to me his intended decision on the application of Mr Ali Al-Fayed.
I made it clear that the decision was to be taken by Mr Wardle, but
suggested further inquiries should be made before a final decision was
reached.
'Following the ministerial changes at the end of July, Nicholas Baker became
the minister responsible for immigration and nationality. On August 29 his
office passed to mine a further submission from the head of the nationality
division containing proposals for taking the case forward, which I saw in
early September after my return from Latin America.
'I subsequently briefly spoke to Mr Baker to confirm that I wanted him to
deal with the applications.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Westminster 'was told policy was unlawful'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading QC warned high-ranking Westminster Council officials that selling
homes to increase the Conservative vote in marginal wards was unlawful, the
public inquiry into alleged vote-rigging has heard.
Mr Andrew Arden, the barrister representing the Labour councillors and local
residents who objected to Westminster's housing policy, said conflicting
accounts existed of a crucial meeting between Mr Jeremy Sullivan QC and
three of the council's senior officials - Mr Graham England, the director of
housing, Mr Paul Hayler, a divisional director of housing, and Mr Robert
Lewis, deputy chief solicitor between 1986 and 1988.
All three are accused of vote-rigging in the provisional report published by
the district auditor, Mr John Magill, after a four-year investigation.
Mr Arden said there were three records of what was said at a meeting on May
5 1987.
Mr Lewis told the district auditor that the three officials were very open
with Mr Sullivan and explained that the 'hidden agenda' of Conservative
councillors was to boost the Tory vote by concentrating the sales of the
homes in marginal wards. Mr Sullivan replied that this was unlawful, the
inquiry was told.
On the same day, Mr Arden said, Mr England wrote to councillors saying that
Mr Sullivan had advised that the homes should be sold in both marginal and
non-marginal wards 'to protect the council'.
Mr England noted that councillors had set a target of 'at least' 250 sales a
year.
He added that councillors would have to decide whether this target applied
only to the marginal wards. He said if that was the case 'somewhere in the
region of 300 to 350 properties' would have to be sold.
In the event, councillors decided in July of that year on an annual target
of 500.
With only a limited number of homes becoming empty each year, the council
had to put half of its housing stock into the scheme in order to reach the
sales target.
The inquiry has heard that Mr England repeatedly warned councillors that
such a high number of sales would inevitably mean that the council would not
be able to meet its statutory obligations to house the homeless. Documents
circulated on August 3 1987 set out the targets for new residents - referred
to as 'new electors' - needed in each of eight marginal wards.
Mr Arden said that Mr Matthew Ives, the council's chief solicitor between
1985 and 1993 and now director of professional conduct at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, had written at the top of the
document: 'This paper should not have been produced by an officer. Much more
subtle approach required. This paper shows officers working for a Tory
victory.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Harrods boss puts stress on his patriotism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed said last night that in disclosing that he has made
payments to MPs - disclosures which have sent the government into a state of
turmoil - he is acting as a good British patriot.
'I am carrying the flag', he said. 'My fight against sleaze is a fight for
the country.'
However, for all this patriotic fervour, Mr Fayed is not a British citizen,
although he and his brother Ali - both Egyptians by birth - have applied for
citizenship.
Indeed the story of their applications sheds light on their complicated
relationship with the British government.
It was two years ago that Mr Ali Fayed first started to consider applying
for citizenship. As co-owner of Harrods with his brother he had lived in the
UK for well over a decade and has English children.
Through his solicitor soundings were taken from a senior cabinet minister.
'We were told there would not be a problem,' said one of Mr Fayed's close
friends.
The application was made in February 1993. In the following 12 months the
nationality division of the Home Office in Liverpool processed it.
The friend said: 'We then rang the top banana at Liverpool who told us that
'everything was in order'. We took that as meaning it had gone well.' As a
result Mr Mohamed Fayed put in his application for citizenship.
The brothers say their references came from 'very distinguished British
figures'. One was Lord Bramall, the former chief of the defence staff. This
spring, however they discovered that 'the application had stalled at
ministerial level'.
The Home Office said that there was nothing sinister about that. Although
decisions on citizenship were normally taken by officials of the nationality
division, more difficult cases were passed to ministers. The Fayed brothers
fell into that category automatically because they had been criticised in a
DTI report on their takeover of House of Fraser - which owned Harrods and
other department stores.
The minister responsible for taking the decision was Mr Charles Wardle, a
junior Home Office minister responsible for immigration.
This was of concern to the Fayeds, because they feared that he faced a
potential conflict of interest. They are acutely aware that in March 1990,
after the publication of the DTI report into their takeover, Mr Wardle had
made a speech which was implicitly critical of them.
They were also aware that from 1987 to 1990 he had been an adviser to the
leading firm of accountants, Peat Marwick. This firm had for years audited
the accounts of their longstanding corporate opponent, Lonrho, which had
lobbied for the DTI to investigate their House of Fraser purchase.
Mr Jim Butler, the senior partner of Peats at the time, was the 'client
partner' of Lonrho, the accounting firm said yesterday, and had a
longstanding relationship with the group. As senior partner, the firm said,
he was also in theory the man who hired Mr Wardle.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is thought to have suggested that Mr
Wardle ask the Bank of England if it had any views on the Fayeds, since the
Bank investigated their suitability as owners of Harrods Bank.
An official said, however, that the Bank had received no approach from the
Home Office and that it would have been futile, because it was a criminal
offence to pass on such information.
As of yesterday, no decision had been taken on the Fayeds' citizenship.

Consumer confidence about the economy dipped slightly in October, says a
Gallup survey conducted on behalf of the European Commission.
Thirty-two per cent of those polled expect the economic situation to
deteriorate over the next 12 months, compared with 25 per cent who expect it
to improve. The negative balance of 7 percentage points compares with a
negative balance of 3 in September.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Investors pledge Pounds 12m for Crest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sixty-nine City institutions, including the London Stock Exchange, have
subscribed for shares worth Pounds 12m in CrestCo, the holding company which
will own the new electronic share settlement system under development by the
Bank of England.
The funds are intended to finance the development of the system which is
expected to become operational late in 1996. However, none of the
shareholders will have voting rights in CrestCo during the build phase.
These will be held by the Bank of England and will only pass to shareholders
just before the start of live operations.
The Bank of England had been under pressure from the Treasury to ensure that
the costs of developing Crest were not incurred by taxpayers and had
therefore been anxious to obtain financing from the investment community
early in the project's develop-ment.
No shareholder will have a stake larger than 3 per cent and the biggest
investors, so-called Tier 1 organisations, will have subscribed for shares
worth Pounds 375,000 or Pounds 390,000. The Bank said the wide ownership
base was to ensure that Crest's pricing policy, operating regime or
development plans gave no undue advantage to any one commercial interest or
to any one community.
Tier-2 investors will subscribe for shares worth either Pounds 200,000 or
Pounds 210,000, while those in Tier 3 will have committed Pounds 100,000 per
organisation. Tier-4 shareholders will have committed Pounds 30,000 each.
Participants are subscribing for redeemable fixed dividend shares with a
nominal value of Pounds 250. They will give investors a return of 4
percentage points above the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury stock yield as at
October 25. The first dividend will be payable no later than 18 months after
the start of live operations.
Shareholders will first have the opportunity to sell their stakes two years
after the start when there will be a 'rebalancing' to adjust shareholdings
in relation to usage of the system.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Rebels stall Mail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's plan to sell 51 per cent of Royal Mail was put on
hold by senior ministers yesterday amid growing anxieties about a rebellion
by backbench Tories.
Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, sought to persuade the
cabinet's industrial affairs committee to include a privatisation bill in
the Queen's Speech at the opening of the next session of parliament on
November 16.
But the committee failed to agree after warnings from the government's
business managers that enough Conservative MPs may be prepared to vote with
the opposition to defeat the bill.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, is believed to have warned that
eight Tories who last week signed a Commons motion supporting public
ownership were likely to be joined by at least two previously uncommitted
backbench MPs.
That would be enough to defeat the government by a majority of six if all
MPs voted, leaving the government dependent on assistance from the Ulster
Unionist party to force the bill through.
Downing Street said that 'more ministerial consideration' was needed before
the cabinet took a final decision on the bill, probably next week. Officials
said, however, that a cabinet vote could be put off until shortly before the
Queen's Speech.
The delay is a blow to Mr Heseltine, who believes that the government must
press ahead with legislation or risk being seen as a lame-duck
administration. He is supported by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who
believes that enough Tory rebels could be persuaded to abstain for the
government to push the bill through.
Mr Clarke is refusing to countenance compromise proposals floated by the
rebels which would allow the Post Office to remain in the public sector with
significantly greater commercial freedom.
Mr Heseltine has the support of several rightwing committee members,
including Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary.
The cabinet is believed to be fairly evenly split, although some influential
senior ministers who were initially sceptical now believe the bill should go
ahead, including Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
MPs said the final decision might depend on a judgment by Mr Richard Ryder,
the government chief whip, on whether Ulster Unionists MPs, who are formally
opposed to the sell-off, can be expected to abstain.

FT  25 OCT 94 / TUC official raps profit-related pay as 'tax dodge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-related pay schemes are an unfair tax dodge for employers, a Trades
Union Congress official said yesterday.
Mr Bill Callaghan, head of the TUC's Economic and Social Affairs Department,
said that the TUC would be calling for an end to profit-related pay. 'I
don't think the rest of us should be subsidising companies in that way.'
The TUC said such schemes would cost the taxpayer about Pounds 500m this
year. Union leaders are suspicious that profit-related pay schemes approved
by the Inland Revenue, which involve payments of a tax-free bonus which is
not consolidated into incremental earnings, may be used as a method of
getting away from annual pay bargaining.
Mr Callaghan told a London conference on employee financial participation
that such schemes were no substitute for industrial democracy.
He said: 'If workers are to share some of the entrepreneurial risks of a
business then they should have the opportunity to influence strategic
decisions.'
A report on employee financial participation in companies, published by the
Confederation of British Industry, the employers' organisation, and Cable
and Wireless, the telecommunications group, showed a big growth in
profit-sharing schemes in the past four years.
The report found that almost two-thirds of nearly 300 organisations
questioned were operating some form of financial participation scheme.
Executive share options were the most popular form of schemes approved by
the Inland Revenue used by 37 per cent of the companies, while 29 per cent
operated save-as-you-earn schemes and 28 per cent used profit-related pay.
Nearly a fifth said they used such schemes to replace some existing pay and
12 per cent said they used them in place of a future pay increase.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Architects unveil new blueprint for benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jobseeker's Allowance reflects continuity in government's labour market
policy rather than a radical move forward.
The grand claims made for it yesterday by the scheme's architects, Mr
Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the social
security secretary, may be overstated.
Since 1986 steps have been taken to to stamp out false benefit claims and
increase pressure on the jobless to find work. The allowance may introduce a
simpler way of assisting the unemployed.
The allowance will replace unemployment benefit and income support for any
eligible person without work for six months or less, and dealt with through
a single office - the Jobcentre. The complex system run by the employment
and social security departments with different rules, locations and
bureaucracies will be swept away.
The allowance will not be means-tested for the first six months. At present
unemployment benefit is paid automatically for the first 12 months that a
person is without work.
The unemployed will have to sign an agreement to receive the allowance. This
will require the recipient 'to be available for any work which they can
reasonably be expected to do', very much in line with the present obligation
on a claimant to be actively seeking work.
The employment service will - as now - be able to insist on claimants
participating in programmes designed to help the jobless back to work. After
six months an unemployed person with no money or only a small amount will
qualify automatically for the allowance, but everybody else will be
means-tested, while those with capital resources of more than Pounds 8,000
will not be eligible.
The government estimates that 90,000 claimants will lose benefit entitlement
in the first year of the allowance, with a further 150,000 having to switch
to means-tested benefits, often at reduced rates. Mr Portillo may be keen to
increase the incentive for the jobless to find work but his white paper
falls short of this.
At present, an unemployed person can keep just Pounds 5 a week of any money
earned while receiving benefits, after which they are cut on a
pound-for-pound basis of earnings.
This provision has not been changed for six years nor will it be under the
new allowance. The white paper says: 'Such limits on earnings are necessary
to ensure people do not receive income from benefit and part-time work to
the point where there is no incentive for them to move off benefit and into
full-time work if the opportunity arises.'
But the government is introducing a 'back-to-work bonus' for anybody
unemployed for three months or more, built up as a lump-sum entitlement
based on part-time earnings. As now, they can still keep the first Pounds 5
a week of any part-time earnings while a couple retains the first Pounds 10.
In addition, for every pound earned over that level they will build up a 50p
credit entitlement paid as a bonus only when the jobseeker secures a
full-time job.
But this means a jobseeker will receive no extra money immediately for
part-time work, hardly an incentive. The punitive element in the new
allowance also reflects a continuation of the existing policy, although the
white paper recognises that only 'a small minority seek to abuse the benefit
system'.
The allowance will not be paid to those who fail to attend an employment
service interview. Those who leave work voluntarily or through misconduct or
who refuse a job will be disqualified from benefit for up to 26 weeks.
How the allowance will operate depends on how the employment service
administers it. There will need to be room for local discretion if hardship
is to be avoided.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Jobseeker's Allowance prompts Labour attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday unveiled details of its Jobseeker's Allowance,
describing it as 'a major step forward in the reform of the benefit system
and in the help given to the jobless'.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, said the government estimated
the scheme would mean a Pounds 100m net cut in its spending on unemployment
in 1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m every following
year. But he was unable to say what impact the allowance would have in
reducing the number of registered unemployed.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said an estimated 150,000
unemployed people a year should benefit from the introduction of the
back-to-work bonus, an accumulated credit of up to Pounds 1,000 for
part-time work done while unemployed, paid after moving into full-time
employment.
He told the Commons the allowance would 'help Britain generate more jobs and
give better value for taxpayers' money'.
Labour attacked the proposal to impose a cut on those who have paid National
Insurance contributions by limiting the period of their entitlement to the
new allowance to a maximum of six months.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, stressed that people in
this category were now entitled to unemployment benefit for 12 months.
He accused the government of seeking to make a unilateral departure from its
obligations, and asked: 'What insurance company would get away with an
increase in premiums and a reduction in benefit of this kind?'
The allowance was also attacked by Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress
general secretary, who said it was 'mean-spirited and irrelevant'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Horror tax video set to terrify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You've had the nightmare, now see the video.
The Investigators, a 20-minute film produced by accountants Pannell Kerr
Forster, may be short on action but makes up for it in chilling detail.
It tells the everyday story of a businessman running a small furniture
company, and his unsuspecting accountant.
A tip-off from an aggrieved associate leads to an Inland Revenue
investigation.
Our hero, the accountant, and his client, are called to an interview with
the inquiry branch. The businessman disastrously underestimates the
situation: 'I'm supposed to be playing golf that day.'
He ends up admitting to fraud, much to the amazement of his accountant, and
the film ends with the tax inspectors searching his home safe for further
evidence.
The video, which will be shown to chambers of commerce and other groups, is
designed to emphasise the growing need for businesspeople to have expert tax
advice.
Pannell Kerr Forster says it believes everyone has the right to the best
advice possible.
'The Investigators leaves the audience with no illusions about the Revenue's
power to gather information and their willingness when they consider it
appropriate to visit business premises and taxpayers' homes in their quest
to recover tax interest and penalties,' said the film-makers.
The video comes at a time when the Revenue has increased its investigations
work to the point where the yield was Pounds 4.7bn in 1993-94, or the
equivalent of 2.5p on the basic rate of income tax.
The government is also to consider a report by Mr Phillip Ely, former
president of the Law Society, into proposals for the powers of tax
investigators to be widened to include access to accountants' papers.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Teachers call for action on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compensation arrangements for those who were wrongly advised to take out
personal pensions must include reinstatement in the original occupational
scheme, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said yesterday.
The call for reinstatement came ahead of today's report from the Securities
and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, on compensating the
victims of poor advice.
The union estimates that full settlement of all the cases it took up where
teachers seemed to have received bad advice could cost life insurers more
than Pounds 2m for just 140 individuals. Compensation in each of the 10
cases settled so far has been between Pounds 3,800 and Pounds 30,000.
Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, expressed anger that many life
companies had refused to agree compensation before publication of SIB's
guidelines. SIB intended to publish its guidelines by the end of July but
said it wanted to assess how workable its approach would be.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Ashdown slams 'hostile' Tory policy on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night attacked the
government for allowing its policy on Europe to swing dangerously between
indecision and hostility.
Mr Ashdown said: 'It is time for Britain's financial and business community
to put pressure on the government for a more positive approach.'
He said that the exclusion of sterling from a single European currency would
damage the entire country and that the City would 'suffer most of all'.
Speaking to members of the Corporation of London's policy and resources
committee, he forecast that a 'core group' of the 12 member states would
form a monetary union within six years.
Mr Ashdown dismissed the demands of the Tory Euro-sceptics that Britain
should reject such a development outright, and deplored the 'wait-and-see'
attitude of the government and Labour leaders.
He also rejected the view that because of its strength and worldwide
reputation the City would maintain its dominant position even if Britain
were outside a European monetary union.
Mr Ashdown insisted that such opinions were a snare, a trap and a delusion.
He said: 'A single currency is not an issue that we can put off
indefinitely.'
He reaffirmed that after the next general election the Liberal Democrats
would use their influence to ensure that Britain was not excluded from a
single currency.
Mr Ashdown appealed to the City to adopt a more constructive role in
tackling the 'short-termism' which had held back Britain's economic
development.
He suggested that a committee should be appointed to examine the long-term
investment needs of business and recommend how the situation could be
improved.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Farming sidelines 'reap Pounds 650m'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farmers earn Pounds 650m a year from business sidelines such as
bed-and-breakfast, riding, and game shoots, says a forthcoming survey by
Produce Studies, the international marketing and research organisation.
It says that this is nearly 6 per cent of the Pounds 11bn they receive from
mainstream crop and livestock production.
Mr Howard Biggs, head of surveys for Produce Studies, said: 'For many farms,
even if it's only Pounds 2,000 extra a year, it makes the difference between
keeping afloat and going under.'
Two out of three farmers make less than Pounds 10,000 a year from
diversifying, and a quarter earn less than Pounds 1,000. But 10 per cent
earn more than Pounds 300m between them, some making more than Pounds 50,000
a year each. Mr Biggs said these tended to be well-heeled farmers with the
land and facilities to offer sophisticated accommodation or leisure
activities.
The organisation surveyed 1,000 of the 114,000 farms in Britain with 20
hectares or more, which account for 94 per cent of agricultural land.
It found 40 per cent have at least one source of earned income other than
food production, with many farmers selling ploughing, spraying or harvesting
services to others.

FT  25 OCT 94 / US power group moves to build Pounds 400m gas plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enron, the US gas supply and power generation company, said yesterday that
it had taken the first step towards building a new Pounds 400m power station
on Teesside.
The company said a wholly owned subsidiary, Flotilla Power, had signed a
connection agreement with the National Grid for a 779MW combined cycle gas
turbine power station on 20 acres of disused land at Imperial Chemical
Industries' North Tees works.
Enron, the leading partner in the Pounds 850m Teesside Power Station, which
opened last year on land beside ICI's Wilton works south of the River Tees,
will carry out a feasibility study into potential markets for the proposed
station.
It will consult local bodies, including conservation groups, before deciding
whether to seek planning consent from the Department of Trade and Industry.
The project would use North Sea gas piped ashore at Teesside from the
Everest and Lomond fields through the Pounds 950m Central Area transmission
system. Electricity produced would be supplied via the National Grid,
linking into power lines near the site.
Enron said it was 'reserving its position' by applying now to the National
Grid. It has asked the Grid to be prepared to make the connection available
from 1998. It said no decision had been taken on whether to go ahead, nor on
whether, if the project did proceed, to seek partners. At Teesside Power
Station, a 1,875MW plant which is one of the world's biggest combined heat
and power stations, four regional electricity companies are shareholders.
Flotilla Power's connection agreement with the Grid, and another signed by a
different consortium in May 1992 for another site north of the Tees, are
conditional on the controversial upgrading of power lines in Cleveland and
North Yorkshire, where two sections, for which the Grid has proposed
alternative overhead routes, remain unresolved.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Commercial radio's share of advertising up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial radio will increase its share of advertising to an unprecedented
6 per cent by the end of the decade, according to a study to be published at
the weekend.
Mr Douglas McArthur, managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, a
body set up to promote commercial radio, said yesterday that the optimistic
projection was the main finding of a consultants' report into the sector by
the Henley Centre.
The full report will be published at the annual Commercial Radio Convention
in Dublin.
The forecasts on commercial radio came as official listening figures
confirmed that the commercial sector had overtaken the BBC's share of
listening for the first time in the 21-year history of the commercial
sector.
Commercial radio has traditionally had only about 2 per cent of display
advertising. In the third quarter commercial radio had revenues of Pounds
56.7m, a rise of 23 per cent from the same period last year. The rise means
that the industry is on course for a 4 per cent share of advertising this
year.
Most of the growth to the end of the decade is expected to come from
existing stations with only 8 per cent coming from new licences.
In the third quarter commercial radio's share of listening rose from 47.4
per cent to 49 per cent with the BBC falling to 48.6. The 2.4 per cent of
'other listening' is mainly accounted for by pirate radio.
Mr Justin Sampson of the Radio Advertising Bureau said yesterday:
'Commercial radio has not hit its peak and prospects for further growth
remain good.'
In spite of the increase in the number of radio stations, radio had 860,000
fewer listeners in the third quarter compared with the same period last
year.
In the quarter commercial radio added 57.1m hours-a-week and the BBC lost
76.5m hours compared with 1993.
Radio 1 lost a further 1m listeners in the quarter to 11.2m. The BBC blamed
the loss of its Radio 1 medium wave frequency. Radio 5 Live had a record
4.4m listeners. Radios 2 and 4 had a stable share with Radio 3 audiences up.
All three national commercial stations, Virgin 1215, Atlantic 252 and
Classic FM showed year-on-year growth.
Atlantic, which broadcasts to the UK from Ireland and is unable to reach all
of the country, managed to increase the number of weekly listeners to 4.93m
compared with 3.85m in the same quarter last year.
Virgin showed similar growth, up from 2.8m to 3.9m.
For the BBC the competition can only increase with the effect of five new
commercial stations launched last month showing up in the fourth quarter
figures.
The BBC suggested yesterday that commercial radio was reaching market
saturation with two high-profile London stations losing listeners - Capital
FM down 7 per cent and Kiss 100 down 8 per cent.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Irish police raid republican dissidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nationwide raids by Irish police on terrorist targets at the weekend provide
the first evidence of opposition in republican circles to the IRA ceasefire
and the peace process.
The raids by Gardai officers in four counties near the Ulster border
resulted in the seizure of guns, ammunition, hand grenades and detonators
belonging to a previously unknown group called the Irish National Republican
Army.
The operation, coming as it did on the eve of yesterday's meeting at
Chequers between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr John
Major, his UK counterpart, will underscore the Irish desire to accelerate
the peace process and harness Sinn Fein and the broader republican movement
to the peace process.
The operation follows a meeting between Mr Reynolds and Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein leader, last Thursday.
A Gardai statement said the raids were directed against 'breakaway factions
such as Republican Sinn Fein and the Irish National Republican Army' which
were involved in 'criminal and subversive activity'.
Republican Sinn Fein is a splinter group established after a break with Sinn
Fein in 1986, when Mr Adams abandoned the movement's policy of boycotting
elections in the republic in a bid to raise local support. The RSF, with the
more extremist IRA offshoot, the Irish National Liberation Army, has refused
to endorse the August 31 decision to call a ceasefire.
The weekend finds came as the Gardai reportedly withdrew border checkpoints
at four locations in the Sligo Leitrim area in the wake of improvements in
the security situation.
In a related development British troops have reportedly reduced their
presence in both Londonderry and Tyrone, two nationalist areas in the north.
For the first time in more than 20 years a number of border crossings were
reportedly unmanned at the weekend, a development which one unionist
councillor yesterday condemned as a concession to the IRA.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Plea to maintain Ulster spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Public spending for Northern Ireland should be maintained at current levels
in the short term if the peace process is to be moved forward, says the
Northern Ireland Economic Council, an independent body set up to advise the
secretary of state.
The council's autumn review of the province's economy, which was published
yesterday and prepared after the IRA ceasefire on August 31 but before the
loyalist cessation, warns of short-term adjustment problems associated with
the peace process that will have to be handled 'carefully, sensitively and
gradually'.
The report says: 'It is important to stress that in the short-term
transitional period it is the composition of public expenditure that should
change rather than its overall level.'
With some local economists concerned that the Treasury is keen to see cuts
in the wake of the ceasefire, the review provides support to those opposed
to public spending cuts.
The NIEC stresses that, with the state accounting for 35 per cent of those
in employment, subventions - government subsidies - are 'the most
significant determinant of demand in the economy'. The report says that
government funding, which is planned at Pounds 7.4bn in 1994-95, helped to
damp the recession in a province with the highest number of long-term
unemployed.
Citing the example of the police and prison services, where employment
levels are three times higher than in other UK regions, the council says the
peace process calls for redeployment of personnel and the reallocation of
public spending towards 'more constructive' economic use.
It says: 'Peace, as well as conflict, involves difficult economic adjustment
problems. These, however, have to be handled with care and in a sensitive
manner to ensure that the 'peace process' is moved forwards rather than
backwards.'
The NIEC also voices support for the controversial issue of greater
north-south economic links, through increased cross-border trade, a more
fully integrated island economy and improved policy co-ordination in areas
such as energy and transport.
The extent of any new all-Ireland institutions is a central issue in the
negotiations between London and Dublin on the proposed framework document,
which will provide the basis for planned all-party talks on the new
political arrangements for the province.
London is aware of unionist sensitivity on the issue, however, and is
anxious that Irish moves to provide these bodies with executive powers are
not seen as a dilution of British sovereignty.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Report on social justice avoids specifics on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's social justice commission has ranged far beyond the future of
Britain's welfare state. Subtitled 'strategies for national renewal', its
report addresses a 'wider malaise' of seemingly 'inexorable' national
decline.
Its recommendations are similarly wide in scope, ranging from detailed
changes to the benefits system to a call for a wholesale 'political
revolution'.
In the style of Lord Beveridge's 1942 report, which the present report seeks
to update, Sir Gordon Borrie and his fellow commissioners start with a
statement of aims and values. None of them is new. Some - such as the
elimination of poverty - go back to Beveridge. Others - 'we must radically
improve access to education and training' - are now platitudes. The rest
repeat catchy but vague slogans popularised by the campaign to elect
President Bill Clinton in the US - 'We must transform the welfare state from
a safety net in times of trouble to a springboard for economic opportunity'.
The impact of the Borrie report will rest on its specific proposals, and how
they are to be carried through. These are divided into three broad policy
fields, education and training, employment, and the tax and benefits system.
Although there are some significant and controversial proposals in the first
two areas - notably a minimum wage, a voluntary community service scheme and
graduate contributions to university tuition costs - it is the future of
state benefits which is most critical for the Labour party. In terms of both
public spending implications and numbers of voters affected, it is an
electoral minefield, and the necessity for detached, strategic thinking on
the benefits question was the most important reason why the late John Smith,
Labour leader, set up the commission two years ago.
But a striking feature of the report is the hesitant nature of key
recommendations, and the reluctance to specify how they will be funded.
Universal nursery education is held to be 'one of the highest priorities for
government investment over the next decade'. To raise the Pounds 1bn extra a
year to pay for it the commission notes two ideas, using funds from student
contributions to fees, or devoting some of the saving made from phasing out
the married couple's tax allowance.
The report says, however, that the student income 'may be needed to expand
the higher education system', while it transpires later in the report that
the commissioners could not agree on the use of the Pounds 2.5bn gained from
the married couple's allowance.
Some wanted half of it to go to nursery education. Others wanted it all to
be spent on an increase in child benefit. If the latter course were adopted
the funding would have to come from taxation - a 'tax and spend' policy of
the kind Sir Gordon Borrie went out of his way to disown yesterday.
In the pensions and benefits arena the commission claims to steer a middle
way between those seeking a radical shift to means-testing on the one hand,
and the advocates of wholesale integration of the tax and benefits systems
on the other. In reality, however, the report goes a long way towards the
means testing of state payments to pensioners.
The main proposal is for a 'pension guarantee'. This would, in effect,
underwrite the government's decision to increase the basic state pension in
line with prices, while offering a more generous top-up for poor pensioners
than is currently provided by income support. The report attacks
means-tested benefits for pensioners, yet the top-up would also be means
tested, although on a different basis to income support.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the
'pension guarantee' was the most important proposal. 'If accepted by the
Labour party, it marks an enormous shift from previous commitments to a
large increase in the universal state pension,' he said.
The other key pension recommendation is for a 'universal second pension' for
future pensioners. All employees would have to belong to a regulated second
pension scheme, in addition to the national insurance scheme, to which
contributions would be paid by the state for the unemployed and for those
caring for people at home.
There is no equivalent shift with regard to the other universal state
benefit - child benefit. The commission supports an increase in the level of
child benefit, with the possibility of only a modest clawback from taxing
high-rate tax payers for the sum received.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Blair hedges approval of ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday committed Labour to a radical shake-up of the
welfare state as he signalled approval for the broad thrust of the ideas
tabled by the Social Justice Commission.
Mindful of Conservative charges that he favoured expensive new spending
proposals, and of divisions in his own party over the future of welfare, Mr
Blair insisted that the commission's report was not a blueprint for Labour's
manifesto. He made it clear that he was more enthusiastic about some of its
recommendations than others.
But echoing some the central themes of its recommendations, Mr Blair said
that Labour would build a 'second generation' welfare system, directed above
all at attacking 'the insecurity of middle income Britain and poverty of low
income Britain'.
His comments came as senior Labour figures said that the report provided the
party with the rationale to drop previous costly spending pledges on
pensions and child benefits which had reinforced its reputation for
'tax-and-spend'.
Dismissing the idea that modern welfare could be based on the right's
reliance on market forces or on the left's past attachment to higher benefit
spending, Mr Blair set out a series of guiding principles for the new
approach:
'Giving people a hand up rather than a handout', involving provision of
services such as childcare and training as well as income support and
unemployment benefits.
Adapting to the changing patterns of family life rather than being tied to
the concept of the 'nuclear family' which had guided the Beveridge report.
Recognising that citizenship involved responsibilities as well as rights and
abandoning commands 'from government on high' in favour of local decisions
and public/ private partnerships.
Turning to the specific proposals in the report, Mr Blair singled out its
plans for a minimum pension guarantee for the elderly poor as an idea worth
pursuing.
He indicated his backing in principle for taxation of the child benefit
received by households liable to the top rate of income tax and welcomed the
suggestion for a new citizen's service scheme for young people.
He gave broad support to the report's 'welfare-to-work' shake-up of the
benefit system but suggested that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor,
would improve on the specific measures.
Mr Blair made it clear, however, that he was far less convinced by the
recommendation for a graduate tax to fund the expansion of higher education.
He said there was a risk that it would deter young people from poorer
backgrounds from going into higher education.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Lifetime of learning plan for education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commission has made six proposals to reform the system of education and
training, which it says is now 'designed to serve an academic elite and to
fail the rest'.
The commission wants to introduce a system of 'lifetime learning'. The
educational reforms in the package build on proposals launched by other
bodies in the past two years. They are:
Universal pre-school education for children aged three and four.
The prime minister made a 'cast-iron commitment' to introduce nursery
education for all four-year-olds at the Conservative party conference two
weeks ago.
He left open the question of funding, but hinted that he would prefer a
voucher system.
The commission appears to endorse a version of the voucher scheme, with a
system of fee-relief to allow low-income families to use private provision.
A campaign against illiteracy and innumeracy.
This would concentrate on work with young children rather than on adults.
The commission suggests that more use should be made of volunteers, building
on experience in inner-London primary schools.
The abolition of A-level exams in their current form.
They would be replaced with a unified examination system for 14 to
19-year-olds incorporating academic and vocational qualifications. This is a
model backed by organisations ranging from the Headmasters' Conference,
which represents the most prestigious boys' and mixed schools, to the
Industrial Society and the Confederation of British Industry. A
state-enforced minimum investment in training by employers.
Employers would be expected to pay about 1 per cent of their wage bill -
rising to 2 per cent or more over time - on training. This could be spent by
companies on their own training, or contributed to the government to arrange
external courses.
Expanded higher education with graduates paying for some of their tuition.
The commission praises the new system in Australia, where students take a
loan and repay it via higher tax contributions, linking repayment to their
ability to pay. But it gives no details for a new system. A new 'Learning
Bank' which would fund all post-16 education on a common basis.
This body would handle both employers' contributions to training and the
funds produced by tax payments from graduates. It would provide people with
individual learning accounts which they could use throughout their lives to
fund any form of education.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Ownership of pension surpluses queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A comprehensive biennial review of UK accounting, published this week,
questions whether pension-fund surpluses really belong to employers.
The report, by Ernst and Young, the accountants, is based on detailed
examination of the accounts of 500 leading companies.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which reviews in 1,600 pages
company compliance with reporting standards, calls on the Accounting
Standards Board to reform the present code on pension funds.
The report says: 'It is not evident, as a matter of either law or economic
reality, that employers can regard pension fund surpluses as their own
unfettered property.'
Mr Ron Paterson, a technical partner with Ernst and Young, and one of the
authors, said: 'It is a difficult legal and moral question as to who owns
the surplus on a pension fund.'
At present a company is entitled to show the surplus on a pension fund as an
asset on the balance sheet but the report insists that in practice the
scheme members can generally exert a claim over the surpluses 'to some
degree'.
The report concludes that in the light of the Maxwell affair, and the review
of the legal framework for pensions after the Goode Report, the code for
accounting for pensions, known as SSAP 24, should be reviewed.
It says: 'The ASB should reassess whether the standard really fits the legal
and economic relationships which it is intended to portray.'
The report contains criticisms of some of the ASB's other standards. Mr
Paterson said: 'The board has grasped some nettles with vigour - but is not
always as efficient as it might be. However, the general standard of
accounting is improving because of its efforts.'
The report adds, however: 'We are afraid that the ASB may be outrunning the
capacity of the accounting profession to absorb and apply these new and
often difficult rules.
'Both the content of future standards and the pace of their development need
to be less ambitious, or else a gulf might develop between theory and
practice, particularly in relation to small companies.'
The report criticises the ASB over Financial Reporting Standard 7, on fair
values following an acquisition. While acknowledging that this will reduce
significant abuses it says the standard was produced in haste and 'a number
of issues have been ducked'.
It also attacks FRS 5, on representing the substance of a business in the
accounts rather than following the legal form, as 'daunting' and
'elaborate'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Investor watchdog hints at review of heavy fine tactic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shift away from the use of heavy fines for financial organisations which
fail to meet regulatory standards was signalled yesterday by Ms Colette
Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority.
Speaking at the Chartered Insurance Institute, Ms Bowe said one task facing
the PIA, the new watchdog to protect the private investor, was to develop
its own approach to discipline.
'My own personal view is that massive fines which, in the case of a mutual,
end up being paid by existing policyholders, are not always the most
appropriate form of discipline,' she said.
Her comments appeared to contrast with the views of Lautro, the watchdog's
predecessor in regulating life companies. The record penalty imposed by
Lautro rose this year from Pounds 180,000 levied on Legal &amp; General in
February to Pounds 300,000 on Premium Life and Norwich Union in April.
Ms Bowe seemed to favour a more clear focus on individual responsibilities
in errant organisations - which would require the watchdog to introduce
registration of individuals as well as companies.
The regulator plans to issue consultation papers on both registration and
discipline early next year.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Minimum wage 'would not cost jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commission's labour-market recommendations swing between broad policy
speculation and technical detail.
The technical detail - for example, introducing part-time unemployment
benefit - is more interesting but, like most other proposals in the report,
is not costed.
The report provides a spirited defence of what could be Labour's Achilles'
heel at the next election, the claim that it will create full employment
while re-regulating the labour market and introducing a minimum wage.
The commissioners argue powerfully that intelligent labour market regulation
need not cost jobs. They say that a minimum wage of Pounds 3.50 an hour -
substantially below the level sought by most union leaders - would benefit
about one in 10 employees without a negative effect on employment. They even
say that it would save the government between Pounds 1.3bn and Pounds 1.6bn
by reducing in-work benefit.
But while the commissioners claim that new regulations are not going to cost
jobs they have little to say about job creation. It is assumed that the
stronger economy Labour will create will sustain a higher level of
non-inflationary demand and so more jobs.
At times the commissioners appear to doubt that this will be enough and
speculate about more employment-intensive growth. Japan - with its highly
efficient trading sector but highly inefficient and therefore job-rich
services sector - is cited admiringly.
Many of the most effective sections of the report reproduce the arguments of
Ms Patricia Hewitt - spelt out in her book About Time - who argues for a
modernisation of both labour-market regulation and the benefit system to
take account of the more part-time and feminised labour market.
Most policy proposals are aimed at 'work-poor' households where nobody has a
steady job. This concern leads to a focus on two groups - long-term
unemployed men, and women who have had to give up work so that their
families can qualify for enough means-tested benefit.
There are two main proposals for dealing with these two groups. The first,
aimed mainly at the long-term unemployed, is called the Jobs, Education and
Training (JET) programme. The second, aimed mainly at the women who have to
give up their jobs, is reform of the benefit system to reduce the need for
means-tested household benefits.
The JET programme is the less original of the two. Some of the suggestions
are too general to be very useful - for example that training investment
should improve people's employability.
Other suggestions are already an established part of public policy. It says,
for example, that a 'comprehensive re-employment service' should be set up,
but that is what the best Jobcentres already provide. It also calls for the
sponsorship of 'micro-entrepreneurs', which is what the government's
enterprise allowance scheme aimed to do.
A further set of suggestions are part of a growing cross-party consensus in
favour of providing extra childcare facilities for lone parents or examining
the selective use of job subsidies.
The more original policy ideas come in the sections on reforming national
insurance and income support. This is part of a larger enterprise to beef up
the national insurance scheme which currently excludes a large number of low
paid and part-time workers.
Some of the problems that the commission addresses are not susceptible to
legislation - for example, convincing men to take jobs they consider
demeaning to their mascu-linity.
The report points out that more than one-third of the long-term unemployed
have qualifications to A levels or their equivalent, in which case training
to get them back to work may not be the solution.
The commissioners do not stray far from the new centre-left orthodoxy -
which they have helped to create - but there is a hint of President
Clinton's 'tough love' when talking about requiring single parents to seek
work if childcare is provided.
The report is strong on restraining wages to help create jobs, something
which the unions - whose vital role is stressed - may not be keen on.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Australia raises rates to squeeze inflation: Move by Willis
decouples the country's policy from that of the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian government yesterday instigated a one-percentage-point rise
in short-term interest rates, a larger-than-expected move that represents a
significant change of heart for monetary policy.
The Reserve Bank, the central bank, raised its official money market
interest rates to 6.5 per cent, the second rise in two months.
Just four months ago, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, was berating bond
market traders for punting on a rise in Australian rates. Both he and Mr
Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, were insistent that with little sign
of inflationary pressure in the economy low rates were necessary to
stimulate business confidence.
But Mr Willis, urged on by the Reserve Bank, now appears to have been swayed
by the growing fashion to hit inflation, currently only 1.7 per cent, before
it has a chance to take off.
The move also decouples Australian policy from that of the US. The
full-point rise was large enough to spare the Reserve Bank from immediate
pressure to follow any tightening by the US in coming weeks.
The decision was a 'judicious use of monetary policy', Mr Willis said
yesterday. In the 1980s, inflation was running at 7 per cent before the
government started to tighten monetary policy. 'With continuing evidence of
robust growth, any delay now in increasing cash rates would risk larger and
more prolonged increases in interest rates later in the cycle,' he said.
Monetary policy was also a more flexible instrument than changes in fiscal
policy, he added.
Pressure on interest rates has come from a strong economic recovery compared
with the rest of the industrialised world. The annual growth rate reached
4.3 per cent during the June quarter. Mr Willis said the government had been
shaving its official forecast for the current financial year, which began in
July, down to 4.25 per cent from 4.5 per cent.
In the past three months, 140,000 new jobs were created and analysts predict
the 3 per cent growth in employment forecast in the government's 1994-95
budget will be exceeded. New capital expenditure in the three months to June
rose 7.7 per cent in constant prices, the best figure since the September
quarter of 1990. Spending on plant and equipment in the period rose 14 per
cent in real terms.
One of the key assumptions underlying the 1994 federal budget was that
business investment would rise by about 14.5 per cent in the current
financial year. Until recently, however, this had remained sluggish, and
manufacturers and analysts alike were sceptical that the target could be
reached.
Australian economists still say the strength and durability of the
investment recovery remains uncertain. Over Australia's winter months, a
number of developments have occurred.
First, the country's drought, which is affecting important agricultural
areas on the east coast, has worsened and persisted through key planting
seasons. Economists point out that this has a mixed immediate impact on
domestic prices, with grain and feedstock prices rising, but the slaughter
of livestock pushing down meat prices. Longer-term, however, the climatic
conditions will almost certainly depress exports (wheat, for example, is a
significant export category) and could have inflationary implications if
future stocks are squeezed. Overall, the drought has been reckoned to knock
about half a percentage point off Australia's annual growth.
Second, Australia's current account situation has looked increasingly
problematic, even before the drought considerations. The ADollars 2.14bn
(Pounds 993m) deficit notched up in August was the worst monthly figure for
almost four years. Analysts and government officials pointed out that
'special items' on the import side explained some of the deterioration.
Nevertheless, the data added support to the argument that Australia risks
seeing business investment surge all at once, sucking in imported investment
goods, machinery and the like. So with drought depressing some export
categories and tough bargaining from Japanese customers for coal and iron
ore leading to lower orders this year, the need to act sooner rather than
later may have become imperative.
Most analysts are expecting more rises, with the next one coming around
February. One forecast that short-term rates would peak at about 9 per cent,
half the 18 per cent high in January 1990.
While the markets welcomed the tightening of monetary policy, they are also
putting pressure on the government to accelerate the reduction of its budget
deficit. The government's budget deficit plan aims to reduce the shortfall
to 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97. The 1994-95 deficit is
forecast to reach ADollars 11.7bn, representing 2.5 per cent of GDP.
Mr Bernie Fraser, Reserve Bank governor, has also put pressure on the
government, saying it should do more to reduce the deficit. Although Mr
Willis does not rule out spending cuts in next year's budget, Mr Keating has
been saying there is no need to cut expenditure while the economy is
growing.
'This doesn't mean fiscal policy can't be changed,' he told businessmen
yesterday. 'On the contrary, if economic circumstances change fundamentally,
sound economic management dictates that a fiscal strategy may need to be
modified. But this isn't the case now.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Asia 'may need to rely on foreign capital'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asia's high savings rates may be insufficient to finance the region's
ambitious infrastructure spending plans in the medium term, forcing
governments gradually to increase their reliance on foreign capital,
according to a study by American Express Bank.
'The share of population living in the cities will have doubled between 1985
and 2010. This creates a huge demand for infrastructure,' says Mr Tapan
Datta, the economist who compiled the study.
Though savings rates are likely to remain high in line with economic growth,
the region is unlikely to generate enough resources domestically to finance
this development.
The need to import capital will weaken countries' current-account balance of
payments, though the deficits should be manageable, the report says.
Some countries may also re-spond by policy moves to damp consumption in an
effort to pro-mote still higher savings rates.
The need to finance infrastructure will also stimulate further
liberalisation of financial markets so that savings can be deployed more
efficiently, Mr Datta said. This would include the development of domestic
bond markets.
Singapore had the highest savings rate in the region last year at 48.3 per
cent, the study adds. But China, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and
Thailand all enjoyed rates of about 35 per cent or more. The savings rate is
personal, corporate and government savings measured as a proportion of gross
domestic product.
The greatest need for foreign capital will face those countries such as
Pakistan and the Philippines where savings rates, at 13.5 and 14.6 per cent
respectively, and living standards are low. Such countries may need to
maintain high real interest rates that curb economic growth.
Outside Japan, the Asian demographic cycle will continue to support high
savings rates as population growth slows and the proportion of people
dependent on savings declines.
The bank says that Japan's high savings rate, of 32.8 per cent last year, in
part reflects the recent fall in land prices. The savings rate slowed when
land prices rose sharply in the late 1980s and may be expected to do so
again when land prices stop falling.
Saving rates may fall in Japan as the proportion of retired people in the
population increases, though the effect is likely to remain small until the
turn of the century.
After that, the number of retired people in the population will rise
sharply.

FT  25 OCT 94 / S Korea leader apologises over bridge collapse: Promise to
punish 'those responsible'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korea's President Kim Young-sam yesterday apologised to the public for
last week's collapse of a Seoul motorway bridge that killed 32 people.
Mr Kim, in a nationally televised speech, promised to punish those
responsible for the accident and vowed 'to root out the corruption'
prevalent in the construction industry.
The bridge accident is perceived by South Koreans as an example of lax
government administration, with Seoul authorities accused of ignoring
warnings about the poor condition of the 15-year-old bridge.
The accident also focuses renewed public attention on widespread graft that
has contributed to sub-standard construction work in Korea.
Officials claim many contractors divert funds from public infrastructure
projects and use the money to bribe bureaucrats in charge of awarding
lucrative government contracts.
Many construction companies are also accused of saving on costs by using
inferior materials and rushing building schedules, while government
supervisors are said to be bribed to grant approval that the structures meet
design specifications.
The issue has taken on increased importance recently as Korea plans to spend
Dollars 100bn (Pounds 66.6bn) on infrastructure projects during the next
eight years.
The government is considering increasing the period that contractors would
be responsible for any building faults from five years at present, to 10 or
20 years after completion.
Mr Kim also criticised Korean work practices in his speech. 'We cannot deny
that during 30-odd years of economic growth, we have tended to implement
projects too quickly, with more emphasis on quantity and superficial
appearances than on quality and substance.'
Five Seoul city officials have already been arrested for allegedly failing
to conduct adequate inspections and maintenance of the collapsed Songsu
Bridge that spans the Han River in the centre of the city. *something in
here (HP) *
Officials of the construction company which built the bridge are also
expected to be questioned by prosecutors.
The company blames the collapse on traffic loads that exceeded the bridge's
design specifications.
Civil engineers are now conducting inspections of the 16 other bridges
across the Han River in Seoul.
Mr Colin Snowdon, city engineer for the City of London, arrived in Seoul
yesterday to help assess the structural condition of the bridges, following
an offer of assistance by Sir Paul Newall, the Lord Mayor, who visited Korea
in April.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Root out terror in your areas, US tells Arafat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Washington yesterday called on Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, 'to root out terror in the areas he controls'.
On the eve of President Clinton's departure for the region, Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, said last week's bus massacre in Tel
Aviv was targeted not only at Israelis but 'aimed at destroying Palestinian
aspirations'.
'If peace brings nothing but more terror,' he said, 'the process of
reconciliation cannot be sustained. Palestinians more than anyone will
suffer. It is imperative Chairman Arafat fulfil his responsibility to root
out terror in the areas he controls. The same courage he demonstrated in
making peace must now be shown in fighting the enemies of peace.'
The US appeal came as Palestinian officials said in Cairo that they rejected
claims by Israel's foreign minister, Mr Shimon Peres, that the two sides had
agreed on methods for combating Islamic attacks on Israelis.
'We did not agree, as they said, on fighting anybody. We agreed the cycle of
violence and counter-violence harms the peace process,' said Mr Saeb Erekat,
Palestinian negotiator. The PLO has said it will not crack down on the Hamas
resistance movement and risk civil war.
The PLO said yesterday the two sides had failed to make any progress in
talks on releasing Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners or lifting the Israeli
closure of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, steps Mr Erekat said were vital to
show Palestinians there was 'genuine peace'.
Israeli officials said their security forces were continuing arresting Hamas
activists across the still Israeli-occupied West Bank. In Gaza, Mr Mahmoud
Zohar, a Hamas spokesman, called on Mr Arafat to protect his life and those
of other Hamas leaders from Israeli attacks.
Mr Clinton's trip will take him to Syria, the first visit by a US president
in 20 years. Mr Christopher held out the hope that an Israeli-Syrian peace
would leave 'no place for terrorists on Israel's borders'.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Gamini Dissanayake, the latest to die ...
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 52-year-old opposition leader had long feared for his life but even as
recently as a few days ago was still saying 'I am confident of winning' the
presidential election to be held in two-weeks' time.
Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland blamed him, along with
other ministers who were in government in the late 1980s, for bringing in
Indian troops to disarm them under an accord between Colombo and Delhi.
In one of his last interviews, in the Madras-based Frontline magazine, he
urged caution in negotiating with the rebels. 'Nothing should be rushed
through,' he said. 'There are deep wounds in the psyche of the people which
have to properly undersood.'
Nevertheless, he added, he would work for 'a just and fair solution ..A lot
of lives have been lost and blood has been incessantly and unnecessarly
shed. It takes two hands to clap and to have a dialogue. A modus vivendi is
necessary. Whether the LTTE (guerrillas) will look at it this way, I do not
know. I hope they do ..'
  .IN THE LONG TRAIL OF ASSASSINATION
1989 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) assumes responsibility for
the murder of several prominent leaders of rival, more-moderate Tamil
nationalist organisations.
1990 LTTE execution squad kills 13 leaders of a rival organisation living as
refugees in India.
1991 Sri Lankan minister of state for defence Ranjan Wijeratne killed in
bomb blast; LTTE widely suspected.
Former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi killed by suicide bomber near
Madras; authorities accuse LTTE.
1992 Ten senior Sri Lankan military officers killed in mine explosion in
LTTE-dominated region.
Sri Lankan naval commander-in-chief Clancy Fernando killed by suicide bomber
believed to be LTTE member.
1993 Sri Lankan opposition leader Lalith Athulathmudali shot dead by lone
gunman; LTTE again denies involvement but widely susptected.
Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa killed by suicide bomber;
authorities blame LTTE.
1994 Sri Lankan opposition leader Gamini Dissanayake killed by suicide
bomber; LTTE denies responsibility but again is widely accused.

India's highest court yesterday rejected a presidential request for an
opinion on whether an ancient temple had existed at the site of a mosque in
Ayodhya demolished by militant Hindus in 1992, and upheld the central
government's acquisition of 67 surrounding acres of land. The Supreme Court
decision will force the government to resolve the issue of the Ayodhya site
claimed by Hindus and Moslems. The government had been unable to decide
whether a temple or a mosque will be built on the site and had hoped the
court would solve the problem.
Taiwan's broadest M2 money supply measure grew 14.64 per cent in September
from a year ago, after rising 15.16 per cent in August, the first time since
last April that M2 growth fell within the central bank's 10-15 per cent
target.
The Philippines posted a budget surplus of 8.96bn pesos (Pounds 220m) in the
nine months to September, against a 16.84bn pesos deficit in the
year-earlier period, the result of higher revenue collection.

An oil tanker captain whose vessel was intercepted in the Gulf on suspicion
of violating UN sanctions said yesterday he had loaded diesel fuel in Iraq
for export in violation of the ban. Captain Izzat Abdulhadi Khalifa, master
of the Al Mahrousa, stated he had loaded 3,162 tonnes of diesel oil in the
Iraqi port of Zubayr between October 16 and 19, then sailed south. The
Saudi-owned, Honduran-flagged tanker was brought to Kuwait under escort
after being stopped by a US warship in international waters on Saturday.

Amnesty International has condemned the Algerian government and its

and armed Islamist groups have acted in total disregard of international and
humanitarian law. A report today, 'Algeria, Repression and Violence Must
End', says 'hundreds are reported extra-judicially killed by the security
forces, as an alternative to arrest or in retaliation for killings by armed
Islamist groups'. These groups 'have delibrately and arbitrarily killed
hundreds of civilians', including those known for their stance against the
Islamist groups' political agenda.

Japan's Keidanren business lobby yesterday urged faster financial
deregulation, as two more foreign companies announced their de-listing from
the Tokyo stock exchange. Britain's Standard Chartered Bank and Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce said they would delist by the end of the year. The
exodus of 18 foreign companies so far this year is seen as a symptom of the
declining competitiveness of Tokyo's capital markets, losing business to
financial centres in Asia. Standard Chartered said the move was part of a
cost-cutting programme. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, Keidanren chairman, warned
Japan's financial industry would be weakened without further deregulation.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Rabin gives cautious backing to bank plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday gave his backing in
principle to the creation of a Middle East development bank which would help
finance regional projects worth tens of billions of dollars.
However, in a meeting with Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, and Mr Avraham
Shochat, finance minister, Mr Rabin made clear that Israel would support the
idea so long as it would not yet have to make any financial contribution to
the bank, which Mr Peres says would be capitalised initially at Dollars 10bn
(Pounds 6.1bn).
Mr Rabin also made his support conditional on further study and government
app-roval and an understanding with the US that any funds given by
Washington to such a bank would not be deducted from US aid to Israel -
worth Dollars 3bn a year and a further Dollars 2bn in loan guarantees.
The commitment to create a regional development bank is expected to be
enshrined in a declaration next Tuesday at the end of the Middle East/North
Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca. The summit will establish an
international working group to consider the feasibility of a regional bank
and to report back at the regional economic conference expected to be held
in Amman next spring.
Mr Rabin's hesitant commitment to the bank reflects differences between the
foreign ministry and treasury. Mr Peres has been an advocate of a regional
bank to be a cornerstone of his vision of a Middle East Common Market
modelled on the European Union. The foreign minister has built a consensus
with Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinians in the past three months on the need
for the bank as a symbol of commitment to economic integration.
They have campaigned for US backing, proposing a bank which would be
capitalised 40 per cent by countries in the region and 60 per cent by
others, such as the US, the European Union and Japan. Each country or bloc
would have voting rights in proportion to its gross national product.
The bank, modelled on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
would principally make capital investments and long-term loans for regional
infrastructure projects, would provide technical assistance for projects and
would raise and lend money on international capital markets. Mr Peres has
proposed Israel invest 5 per cent of the bank's capital, or Dollars 500m.
The regional bank would overcome problems the World Bank has in lending for
regional projects. The World Bank also cannot lend to Israel because its per
capita income is too high and cannot lend to the Palestinians because they
are not a state.
But both the Israeli and US treasuries have been extremely cautious about
creation of another regional development bank and are not impressed by the
current level of regional economic cohesion. They also prefer future
regional projects to be co-financed by other multilateral institutions such
as the World Bank and European Investment Bank and are anxious to avoid
creation of a bank which would lend at concessional rather than market
rates.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Sri Lanka counts cost of bombing
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI, COLOMBO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The assassination on Sunday of Mr Gamini Dissanayake, the Sri Lankan
opposition leader, is a grim reminder of the violence which permeates the
island's politics.
Mr Dissanayake's death comes less than 18 months after assassins claimed the
lives of two other prominent politicians - Mr Lalith Athulathmudali, a close
colleague of Mr Dissanayake, and President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who like Mr
Dissanayake was blown up in the middle of a crowd by a suicide bomber.
In each case the security forces suspect the hand of the LTTE, the Tamil
Tiger separatist militants fighting for an independent homeland for ethnic
Tamils in the north. But the LTTE yesterday denied it was involved, and
police have not in the past found enough evidence to prove their suspicions.
Police in the capital Colombo said yesterday a Tamil woman suicide bomber
whose severed head was found on top of a two-storey building was responsible
for the blast, which killed 52 people.
The tradition of violence predates the LTTE, going back at least as far as
the assassination of the late prime minister, Mr Solomon Bandaranaike, who
was killed in 1959 by a disgruntled Buddhist monk.
Mr Dissanayake's bloody death at the age of 52 brings shock, confusion and
uncertainty to Sri Lankan politics. Its impact also seems likely to spread
to the economy, particularly the tourist industry.
The immediate effect is to rob the opposition United National party of its
presidential candidate for the election which is due to be held next month
in which Mr Dissanayake was running against Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the
prime minister. The government, while postponing indefinitely peace talks
set for yesterday with the Tamil rebels, said the November 9 presidential
poll would go ahead despite the attack.
Mr Dissanayake was an urbane, western-educated lawyer on the UNP's
conservative wing. He had little chance of winning against Mrs Kumaratunge,
who won a general election only in August when she took power from a UNP
jaded after 17 years' rule. But Mr Dissanayake had gone some way to
rebuilding party morale.
His place could now be taken by Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, who was prime
minister until August, or possibly by the incumbent president and UNP elder
statesman, Mr D B Wijetunga. Either man might hope to capitalise on a
possible wave of sympathy among the majority Sinhalese for Mr Dissanayake or
for the tough pro-military policy he supported on the Tigers - a policy
which may have cost him his life.
Equally important, Mr Dissanayake's death has called into question Mrs
Kumaratunge's whole approach to the Tamil question. She was elected on a
promise to try to make peace with the LTTE, a promise which she has bravely
and rapidly attempted to put into effect by moves including lifting an
economic embargo on the Tigers' northern stronghold in the Jaffna peninsula.
Government officials this month started talks with LTTE representatives.
Despite continuing LTTE attacks on Sri Lankan targets, including ships, Mrs
Kumaratunge persisted with the peace effort. Against the advice of army
officers, she trusted ambiguous peace messages put out by Mr V Prabakaran,
the LTTE leader. Now her strategy has been thrown into jeopardy.
The Colombo stock market was closed yesterday amid an island-wide curfew
imposed after the attack. Mr Jayadeva Uyangoda, an economist attached to
Colombo University, said the economy would suffer in the short term due to
the attack. 'Long term stability will depend on any social unrest and the
overall political situation,' he added.
'In the past, such dramatic assassinations have not impacted on society,
which has come to terms with the deaths of major political figures. Foreign
investors will react only if there is social unrest. Otherwise they will
wait and see what happens before taking the next step.'
Sri Lanka has shown amazing resilience to political deaths. Even last year's
two assassinations did not throw the country's democratic institutions into
disarray: there was little street violence and this year's general election
was peaceful and judged to be fair. The economy has continued to grow, with
gross domestic product up 5.7 per cent last year; the tourists have kept
coming.
Yet it is hard to believe that Sri Lanka can forever enjoy its economic
success and holiday paradise reputation while the streets of Colombo are
regularly soaked in blood.

FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japan speaks up for Asia region - Tokyo's
backing for a South Korean to head the WTO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan, increasingly torn between the US and Asia, has plunged into the
campaign for dynamic Asia-Pacific economies to gain a bigger voice in the
world trading system.
The Tokyo government's recent decision to back Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's
trade minister, as candidate to head the new World Trade Organisation, marks
a startling break with past reticence. Japan never openly declared support
for a particular candidate in the searches for previous director generals of
the WTO's predecessor body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
Its decision to come out in the open and support Mr Kim, rather than fall in
with the consensus, is the latest example of Japan's tentative attempts to
set its own agenda on international affairs.
'The global trading system should not be run by just a handful of nations
from Europe and North America,' explains a senior official of the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry. Japan is not, he hastens to add,
seeking a specifically Asian regional voice for the WTO, which it wants to
be as global in its influence as the next man. Yet it is 'welcome for an
Asian to raise his hand'.
This marks another step in the shift of the country's formerly US-centred
trade and foreign policy towards Asia, its fastest growing export market and
investment destination. Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the region
surpassed its surplus with the US for the first time. Ten years ago, Japan
exported a third more to the US than to Asia; now the balance is the other
way.
Fresh from defying Washington over bilateral trade, Japan, under its new
Asian-oriented prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, is busy cultivating its
nearest neighbours.
Until the world's second largest economy offered its support to Mr Kim, the
South Korean was an outsider in the race for the WTO, despite his formidable
record as a negotiator in the Uruguay Round. Against him are ranked Mr
Carlos Salinas, former president of Mexico, likely to receive US support as
a big player in the North American Free Trade Agreement; and Mr Renato
Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister backed by the European Union.
Apart from Japan, Mr Kim has backing from Australia, keen to lift the
profile of the budding Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum, and
of course from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean). They
back Mr Kim for very similar reasons.
An Australian trade ministry official says: 'We are dealing with a different
Gatt, with an enlarged membership, and in which a large share of the growth
is coming from Apec. We don't want it to be too Euro-centred.'
Yet privately, senior Japanese diplomats admit that even with support from
Japan and Australia, Mr Kim may still be an outsider in the WTO race, due to
be settled by consensus, probably by the end of November. Why, then, back
him?
One theory, held in European diplomatic circles, is that Japan may be
prepared to negotiate over Mr Kim in exchange for some other form of
recognition of Asia-Pacific economies' importance in the WTO.
The truth, explains a senior retired Japanese diplomat, is much simpler.
Tokyo can hardly say No to a South Korean candidate - who was after all put
forward by his own government - at a time when Japan is striving to purge
its wartime record in Asia. This, plus the growing importance of Japan's
Asian export markets, has led to a sharp rise in the political influence of
the Foreign Ministry's Asian affairs bureau. 'It is almost taboo to say No
to Korea,' he explains.
Not that Japan's trade and foreign policy is as passive as it used to be. An
independent line was clear when Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, former prime minister,
refused in February to follow the time-honoured tradition of caving in at
the last minute to US bilateral trade demands, in this case for numerical
targets for import penetration.
To this must be added Japan's clearest statement yet, at the end of last
month, of the conditions under which it wishes to become a permanent member
of the United Nations Security Council. A smaller example is its willingness
over the past week to deepen trade links with Taiwan, thereby risking
China's anger.
All in all, it adds up to a Japan that looks as if it wants to take a more
vigorous role in shaping the WTO than it did in Gatt.

<TEXT>
Pakistan tomorrow launches an effort to expand its trade with the former
Soviet republics in central Asia with the arrival of Ms Benazir Bhutto, the
prime minister, in Ashkabad, the capital of Turkmenistan.
The three-day visit, Ms Bhutto's first to the region, precedes plans to take
a first convoy of trucks with Pakistani goods through Afghanistan to
Turkmenistan, later this month.
Pakistan has been trying to expand trade with the newly independent region
for almost three years. But continued fighting in Afghanistan has disrupted
previous efforts. However, a visit last month to parts of Afghanistan by
interior minister Naseerullah Khan Babar has enabled Islamabad to arrange
deals with local warlords, who have given assurances of safe passage in
return for still undecided local taxes, senior officials said.
Under the plan, the trucks will leave the border post at Chaman, in the
Pakistani province of Baluchistan, before entering Afghanistan and then
Turkmenistan via the western Afghan city of Herat. 'Vested interests can
help to turn the situation to our favour. When some Afghans realise that
there's money in this affair, they'll co-operate,' said a senior government
official.
Pakistan hopes to export small consumer items such as soap, toothpaste,
garments and leather products, which are apparently in short supply in
ex-Soviet republics. In return, Islamabad wants to explore opportunities for
the import of gas and oil from Turkmenistan and neighbouring countries.
Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, Pakistan's commerce minister, said that the prime
minister's visit would open the way for trade but that it was up to business
men to seek opportunities. More than 200 businessmen were expected to
accompany Ms Bhutto to participate in a Pakistani export exhibition.
From Turkmenistan's side, the government of Mr Saparmurad Nayazhov has
already expressed an interest in discussing the oil pipeline.

Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the French multinational, is closing
down its colour television manufacturing plant in Singapore and moving
operations to Bangkok and to Batam in Indonesia. Rising costs in Singapore
are believed to be the main reason for the move. Mr Didier Trutt, a general
manager of Thomson in Asia, said the TV manufacturing industry operated
under severe cost pressures. 'Expanding our manufacturing operations in
Thailand and Indonesia, while strengthening our support functions at the
regional headquarters in Singapore, makes good economic sense,' said Mr
Trutt. TCE first set up in Singapore in 1969 and has about 5,000 workers.
About 900 employees at the Singapore plant will lose their jobs.

The value of Western Australia's mineral and petroleum exports rose by 3.5
per cent to ADollars 12.9bn (USDollars 9.4bn) in 1993-94 and is set to
accelerate in the coming year, the state's resources development department
said. Mr David Kelly, the department's chief executive, said the state
accounted for 43 per cent of the value of Australia's resource exports of
ADollars 29.8bn, 44 per cent of Australian mineral production, 29 per cent
of petroleum production and 57 per cent of new mining investment. Mr Kelly
said exports to Asia continued to grow strongly. Resource exports to China
and Korea rose 26 per cent to ADollars 911m and ADollars 1.16bn
respectively. Exports to Taiwan grew 13 per cent to ADollars 369m. However,
exports to Japan fell 0.4 per cent to ADollars 3.6bn, reflecting Japanese
economic conditions and lower iron ore and gas prices.

<TEXT>
Daewoo, the South Korean industrial group, has taken a 51 per cent stake in
a Dollars 306m joint venture with state-owned Automobile Craiova (AC),
Romania's second car manu-facturer.
The deal is by far the biggest direct foreign investment in Romania since
the end of communism in 1989. Total investment in the project, which aims to
produce up to 200,000 cars a year by the end of the century, could rise to
Dollars 900m, according to AC officials.
AC, which was set up with Citroen in 1976, will contribute its assets and
factory in Craiova, 250km west of Bucharest, to the new venture, Rodae
Automobile Daewoo. Korea's third car manufacturer will pay Dollars 156m for
its stake. It will raise much of this from the sale of 20,000 cars on the
Romanian market, Romanian privatisation officials said. Additional financing
will come from the South Korean Exim bank.
Daewoo will initially assemble a version of its 1500cc Cielo model, a small
family car, at the plant. From 1996, it also intends to produce a new small
car presently under development. The investment is part of a Dollars 5bn
Daewoo plan to quadruple its worldwide production capacity to 2m by the year
2000.
The company plans to build two lines to produce transmissions and engines at
the Craiova plant. Initially the Cielo would be 35 per cent integrated in
Romania, but local content would rise to 80 per cent by 1999. Daewoo aimed
to export more than half of its production to western Europe.
Romania is one of six former east bloc countries with an association
agreement with the European Union, giving it preferential trading rights
with the EU ahead of full membership.
Romania amended its foreign investment law to offer the South Koreans
generous investment incentives.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The vitriolic race in Virginia between Democratic Senator Charles Robb and
Mr Oliver North has finally focused on the constituency which could
determine the outcome on November 8 - the black voters who comprise 18 per
cent of the state's population.
Both men campaigned at black churches in Richmond, the capital, on Sunday.
Mr Robb was in the company of Mr Doug Wilder, the black former Democratic
governor who last week, after intervention by President Bill Clinton,
finally endorsed his long time rival.
Mr Wilder said his appearance with Mr Robb was 'no idle gesture' and
promised to stump for him constantly in the remaining two weeks. The
church's pastor told the senator, 'we are receiving you with delight because
we believe, Brother Robb, that your opponent is bad news'.
Mr North, who enjoys the adulation of the predominantly white Christian
Coalition, told his audience he believed in the power of prayer and that the
Bible is 'the only book I've ever read more than once.'
The latest polls cannot separate the two, with Mr Marshall Coleman, the
independent candidate and a former Republican lieutenant governor, trailing.
This means that neither Mr Wilder's withdrawal from the race in September
nor the continued presence of Mr Coleman on the right has yet dented the
North bubble, as had been expected.
Persuading black voters to turn out on November 8 may be crucial. The
assumption had been that they would stay away from the polls in large
numbers, which could only help Mr North.
Each day in this ferociously negative and expensive campaign, whose cost,
already over Dollars 20m, has only been exceeded by the Senate race in
California between Senator Dianne Feinstein and Congressman Michael
Huffington, brings new charges and accusations of lying. Mr North alleged
last week Mr Wilder's endorsement was only obtained by the promise of an
ambassadorship from Mr Clinton. This produced a furious White House denial.
The Republican candidate had to fend off a story in the Washington Post that
suggested he may have connived at trafficking in narcotics while he was
running the Iran-Contra operation from his position on President Reagan's
national security council.
But the former Marine lieutenant colonel has been unabashed in his onslaught
on Mr Robb. Last week he said his rival's military career, also in the
Marines, was spent more on ceremonial duties than active service. His
commercials, featuring massage parlours and cocaine dealers, recall Mr
Robb's confessions of marital infidelity and some dabbling in drugs.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Foreign investors turn to US real estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investor confidence in US real estate has rebounded with Atlanta and
Washington DC heading the list of most desirable cities for investment,
according to a new survey.
The findings, by the Association of Foreign Investors in US Real Estate
(Afire), contrast sharply with reports that Japanese investors have been
trying to off-load assets acquired in the 1980s buying spree.
'There have been rumours that the Japanese are trying to sell but no
evidence of it,' said Mr James Fetgatter, chief executive of Afire, an
organisation which represents about half the foreign investment in US real
estate. 'Japanese investment has remained at the same level for the past
four years.'
Most of the new foreign investment in real estate is coming from Europe. The
Afire survey found 46 per cent of respondents planning to increase US
holdings, up 14 per cent from 1993. An equal number said they would maintain
investment levels while 8 per cent said they would reduce their holdings
Real estate investment trusts (REITS), which suffered widespread losses in
the 1970s, have been making a comeback, according to the survey. Forty-five
per cent of those surveyed indicated a willingness to invest in future
REITs, up from 11 per cent last year.
The results of the survey seem in line with industry experts' reports. Mr
Randall Rowe of Equity Financial Management, a national office property
company, said the overbuilt commercial property market was showing signs of
recovery, particularly in Denver and Boston. 'In many cities this may be the
last opportunity to lock in cheap space,' he said at a recent Afire
conference. Mr Raymond Torton of Torto/Wheaton Research said office vacancy
rates, now 16.3 per cent, would fall to no less than 12 per cent in 1995 and
could drop to 3.1 per cent by 1999 without a return to overbuilding.
Atlanta, which ran second in the Afire survey in 1993, was ranked as the
most viable city for foreign real estate investment, followed by Washington,
New York, Phoenix, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Aristide nominates new prime minister for Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide yesterday nominated Mr Smarck Michel, a
wealthy Haitian businessman, to be his prime minister, according to an aide
to Mr Michel, reports Our Foreign Staff.
This follows speculation over who would assume the delicate task of forming
a cabinet of national reconciliation, now that Mr Aristide has returned to
power after three years in exile.
Mr Michel helped finance Mr Aristide's successful presidential campaign in
1990 and was commerce minister in 1991 before the military coup. He remained
in Haiti rather than follow Mr Aristide into exile.

FT  25 OCT 94 / US budget deficit falls to lowest for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US budget deficit fell by Dollars 52bn (Pounds 32bn) to Dollars 203bn in
the fiscal year to the end of September, its lowest level for five years.
Although another drop is expected in the current fiscal year - White House
and congressional budget offices estimate a deficit of between Dollars 162bn
and Dollars 167bn - a row has already broken out over how to stop the
deficit from climbing again over the last five years of the decade.
President Bill Clinton said yesterday that he wanted to keep 'managing this
thing in a very disciplined way'.
But with deficits projected to start rising in the 1996 fiscal year and to
be back above Dollars 200bn by the year 1999, the administration has had to
begin the process of considering budget strategies for the coming years.
In a memorandum obtained by the opposition Republican party and widely
distributed to the media, Ms Alice Rivlin, director of the White House
Office of Management and Budget, warned that holding the deficit at next
year's projected level of Dollars 167bn would require Dollars 184bn of
spending cuts or tax increases over the period 1996-2000.
Eliminating the budget deficit entirely - a goal espoused in theory by most
Republican congressional candidates - would require Dollars 684bn of
spending cuts or revenue increases.
Among the possible approaches outlined in the memo are controversial
measures such as cutting the benefits paid under the Social Security pension
scheme, applying a means test to limit payments under the Medicare programme
which provides health insurance for the elderly, or reducing the tax
deductibility of mortgage payments.
Ms Rivlin insisted yesterday that her memo 'wasn't any kind of decision
memo'.
'The Clinton administration isn't actively considering any of these things
at the moment,' she said in a television interview.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Loose guns mar US effort in Haiti: Aristide opponents hold
up to 15,000 weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a rash of new graffiti
has appeared on walls around Port-au-Prince. 'US Army stay for 50 years to
change system,' one red spraypaint slogan spells out.
The plea appears to be in vain. The US has no intention of keeping troops
here for very long, and wants to turn the Haiti operation over to United
Nations peace-keeping forces within six months. But while US forces are
here, many, including UN military planners, complain that US soldiers are
leaving too much of the old repressive system intact by failing to arrest
and disarm many of Aristide's most rabid opponents.
Since the US occupation of Haiti began five weeks ago, about 11,000 weapons,
some as powerful as anti-tank grenades, have been seized from Haitian
civilians. Even the most conservative estimates put the number of weapons
still in the hands of Aristide opponents at around 15,000. . At night and in
isolated areas not firmly under the control of US forces, these arms are
being used by Aristide opponents to 'perpetrate some of the little incidents
of violence that are occurring every day in Haiti,' according to US military
spokesman Col Barry Willey.
'We are supposed to take over a stable environment but with all those
weapons and bad guys still out there I would say it's more like enforcing a
truce,' says a UN commander here on a reconnaissance trip. 'We would like to
see some more forceful disarmament before we arrive.'
Around the capital, tipping off the US military about suspected weapons
hideouts is often an exercise in futility. Early last week, Berel Jenestile,
an Aristide supporter who recently came out of hiding, flagged down a convoy
of military police in the streets of Port-au-Prince to tell them of a arms
cache he had seen being hidden in the hills around the hamlet of St Jude,
located just outside the capital. Staff Sergeant Innocenzo Schiavo dutifully
filled out a report but was not optimistic anything would be done: 'Its got
to be cross-referenced, cross-checked, screened, processed and synthesised
with other military intelligence before a search might be ordered.'
US officials, still afraid of Somalia-like 'mission-creep', insist that
policing and investigatory work is the job of the still largely non-existent
Aristide government. Arrests and raids are made only when the security of US
troops is threatened or a US soldier directly witnesses a heinous crime
being committed.
'We have to get away from the perception that we have the capability to
check out everything,' says Col Willey, adding that 75 to 80 per cent of the
raids in the capital come up empty. Mistaken and awkward raids on a UN
child-vaccination clinic and a famous botanical garden have made the US
military even more reluctant to act.
But equally embarrassing has been a case in Miragoane, where a bus crashed
into a pro-Aristide demonstration, killing 12. US troops arrived on the
scene, took pictures and statements from witnesses and obtained the license
plate numbers of the bus. US forces say that information has not been
followed up on. Civilians armed with automatic weapons can still be seen
patrolling the roads outside Miragoane.
'The US forces have the leads necessary to do normal investigative work,'
says Mr Ira Kurzban, a lawyer for President Aristide. 'We are not saying
that they should search every house in the country, but they should act on
information.'
Capt Mark Adams, head of military intelligence for the region encompassing
Miragoane, counters by saying that 'there is a line that has to be drawn
between military and civilian roles. Our information about the bus crash
will be turned over to the Haitian police and judicial system, when there is
one. We've got to force the judicial system to get on line, because
eventually it will be Haitians who will have to deal with their own
problems.'
In the capital, less than 50 per cent of police officers show up for work
each day and of those, only about half can be persuaded to go out on patrol,
fearing their own safety. One late afternoon at the Cafeteria police
station, Mr Alexi Charles walked in to report that he had been robbed by a
black market money changer. Mr Charles says he was told by the desk sergeant
to come back the next day, because police were not making arrests after 6
pm.
Some of those arrested by the US military, including Haitian military
officers accused of human rights violations, are eventually turned over to
Haitian police, who often let them go for lack of a functioning judiciary.
The Aristide government, recognising that the uncollected guns are not
likely to be used while the US military is in place, has said American
forces can stay as long as Washington wants, leaving the decision up to the
US Congress and the UN. Yet some are beginning to worry that the honeymoon
between the US military and the Haitian people cannot last forever.
US commanders say that while normal infantrymen only patrol in
Port-au-Prince to keep order, in the countryside, where three-quarters of
Haitians live, special forces troops are working to break old habits of
violence and develop local government structures for the UN to oversee.
'If we left now, people would be very unhappy. We still have a lot of work
to do,' says Capt Jim Mis, operational officer for special forces in Les
Cayes, a city 250km south of Port-au-Prince. 'But our goal is to make the
situation stable enough so that we work ourselves out of a job.'

FT  25 OCT 94 / Basque elections strike further blow at Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to regain the political
initiative have suffered a significant setback in regional elections in the
Basque country, where conservatives and communists made strong gains at the
expense of his Socialist party.
The Basque elections on Sunday were won, as expected, by the mainstream
nationalist party, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), which regained the
22 seats it had held in the outgoing 75-member regional parliament. But
despite an active campaign by Mr Gonzalez, the Socialist party, which had
been the junior coalition partner in the PNV-led Basque government, lost
four of its 16 seats in the local legislature, its worst electoral result in
the region.
In a highly fragmented vote that will make creation of a new governing
majority difficult, the conservative Partido Popular (PP) gained 11 seats,
up from six, and the communist-led Izquierda Unida group (IU), which
previously had no members in the Basque parliament, returned six.
Sunday's poll underlined the sharp fall in support for the prime minister
that emerged last June when the PP established a 10-point lead over the
Socialists to win the European parliament elections, and when both the PP
and IU doubled their vote in Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's home region, causing
the Socialist party to lose its majority in local elections held on the same
day.
Mr Gonzalez, who was returned to power for a fourth term in 1993 although
without an overall majority, is blamed for a severe recession that has
raised unemployment to a record level and for a series of corruption
scandals that rocked his government earlier this year.
June's defeats propelled the often reclusive prime minister into a hectic
schedule of parliamentary appearences, public meetings, television 'fireside
chats' and media interviews. However, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader, said
yesterday the Basque poll had confirmed 'the unstoppable decline of the
socialist vote'.
Analysts said the Socialists had probably been penalised in the Basque
elections for co-opting a local left-wing party, Euzkadiko Ezkerra, on to
its ticket and campaigning for the 'ethnic' Basque vote. Traditional
socialist voters in the area are mainly immigrants from elsewhere in Spain
or their descendants.
Mr Gonzalez's popularity will next be tested in municipal elections in May,
as well as in polls to elect new parliaments in 13 of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions.
The responsibility for leading the Basque executive, meanwhile, falls once
more to the PNV, which has governed the area, either on its own on in
coalition with the Socialists, since 1980.

until last week in a mining company seeking a licence for a IPounds 50m
(Pounds 49.4m) lead and zinc mine in County Kilkenny. Mr Brian Cowen, Fianna
Fail minister for transport, energy and communications, has been forced to
sell his shares in the company, Arcon, after his interest was disclosed by
Irish newspapers. He sold the shares for less than half the IPounds 960 he
paid for them four years ago. An ethics bill sponsored by Labour, junior
partner in the coalition government with Fianna Fail, is presently making
its way through parliament. It requires MPs and government ministers to
disclose their interests. Arcon's largest shareholder is Mr Tony O'Reilly,
the Heinz chief executive and Irish newspaper proprietor, who owns 22.6 per

Failure to privatise banks swiftly and halt large loans to loss-making state
enterprises threatens to wreck Bulgaria's fragile financial system, Mr Todor
Valchev, head of the national bank, warned yesterday. The BTA state news
agency reported him telling bankers that political infighting and lack of a
strong government 'paved the way for uncontrolled plundering of the
country's financial resources'. He added: 'The clandestine privatisation
that is under way is very dangerous.' Continued big loans to technically
bankrupt state enterprises were a direct result of the failure to privatise
the communist-era banking system. Among the biggest factors holding back
privatisation in banking itself was the dilemma of how to deal with 'the
huge amount of non-performing loans'.

A one-day national strike ordered by Malta's 43,000-strong General Workers'
Union (GWU) yesterday paralysed most of the island, bringing public
transport, international flights, banks, dockyards, many municipality
services and several hotels and factories to a halt. Most shops also
remained closed. The strike was ordered in protest at the planned
introduction of value added tax next January. Mr Eddie Fenech Adami, the
Nationalist prime minister, pushed the measure through parliament in July
and has shown no readiness to modify the January date. Buoyed by yesterday's
successful stoppage, Mr Anglu Fenech, GWU secretary, said his union clearly
enjoyed national backing in its opposition to VAT, which it claims will
increase the island's cost of living and erode wages. The strike was backed
by the opposition Labour party and the general retailers' and traders'
union.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Jail term for Cantabria chief

<TEXT>
Mr Juan Hormaechea, the conservative chief executive of Cantabria in
northern Spain, yesterday became the first head of a Spanish regional
government to face jail over corruption charges. After a long legal battle,
Mr Hormaechea - a controversial local populist and former mayor of the port
of Santander, capital of the Cantabria region - was sentenced by a Santander
court to six years for embezzlement linked to construction contracts he
awarded in 1991. His imprisonment was delayed, however, pending his appeal
to the supreme court in Madrid. The sentence is an embarrassment for the
opposition Partido Popular (PP). The party had backed Mr Hormaechea when he
was first elected chief minister in Cantabria's 1988 regional elections as
an independent on the PP ticket, and has since failed to persuade him to
resign. In 1992 Mr Hormaechea, who was already facing judicial
investigation, formed his own party to fight the regional elections and was
re-elected chief minister with PP support.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Brussels probes plan for Italy steel takeover

The European Commission has raised 'serious doubts' about the competition
implications of a German-Italian bid for the special steels division of
Ilva, Italy's state-owned steel producer. The German-Italian consortium won
the bid for the division, Acciai Speciali Terni (AST), in June, outbidding
Franco-Italian competitors with an offer of almost L600bn (Pounds 240m).
Yesterday, however, Brussels opened an in-depth investigation into the
offer, on the grounds that the merged group could dominate the European
stainless steel market.
The inquiry, which follows a one-month preliminary examination of the bid,
could last up to four months, casting further doubt over the Italian state's
attempts to privatise the steel sector. Usinor Sacilor, the French
steelmaker involved in the rival consortium, warned in June that it would
complain to the Commission if the German-Italian offer was approved by Iri,
the Italian state holding company. The winning consortium is led by Krupp
Hoesch, Germany's second biggest steelmaker, which would control 50 per cent
of AST. The rest would go to three Italian steelmakers, Riva, Agarini and
Falck. After acquiring AST, Krupp Hoesch's share of the European stainless
steel market would rise from 27 to 43 per cent.
The German company's 50 per cent stake in AST was to have become part of a
joint venture between Krupp Hoesch and Thyssen, Germany's largest
steelmaker, which came into being on October 1. There are suggestions that
Krupp's offer of a joint venture to take over AST also encouraged Riva to
withdraw its offer for Eko Stahl, the ailing eastern German steel mill in
which it had an interest earlier this year.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Poll shock puts Pasok in leadership dilemma: The search for
a successor to the ailing Papandreou
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The defeat of Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's former European affairs
minister, in Sunday's run-off poll for mayor of Athens amounts to more than
a temporary embarrassment for the governing Socialists.
It complicates a succession struggle now gathering momentum in the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) as Mr Andreas Papandreou, 76, the
prime minister, prepares to hand over the leadership, probably next spring.
That is when Mr Papandreou is expected either to seek the presidency (a
largely ceremonial post) through a vote in parliament, or, if his health
worsens further, to retire from politics.
Until Sunday, Mr Pangalos was the frontrunner to take over the helm of
Pasok. His colourful personality, including a talent for putting down
political opponents in a few words, appealed to the party's populist
faction, offsetting the image of an intellectual more at home in Paris than
Athens.
It was always going to be a close race in Athens where voters, as well as
being wealthier and more conservative, have few inhibitions about showing
their dissatisfaction with the government. Mr Papandreou did his best to
shorten the odds with a last-minute offer to inject an extra Dr40bn (Pounds
107m) into the city budget for 1995.
But Mr Pangalos's personal attacks on his conservative opponent, Mr Dimitris
Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat who entered politics last year, clearly
backfired. The leftwing voters whose support he needed in the run-off
deserted in droves, casting blank ballots or switching to Mr Avramopoulos,
who won 54.4 per cent.
Such a heavy defeat marks a personal failure for Mr Pangalos, especially
when the Pasok candidate managed to edge out a conservative in the run-off
poll for governor of Attica, the district that includes Athens. Overall,
too, the local government election results showed the Socialists maintaining
a lead of around five percentage points over the conservative New Democracy
party.
Other candidates for the Pasok leadership are now back in the picture,
though Mr Papandreou is not likely to give any immediate indications of his
preference.
Potential contenders find it hard to jostle for favour in Pasok's byzantine
atmosphere, with Mr Papandreou distanced from political associates by weak
health and his wife Dimitra, who restricts access to him in her role as head
of the premier's personal office.
Few prominent Socialists seem capable of bridging the divisions between the
party's populists - who are nationalist and insist on state participation in
the economy - and the younger pro-European technocrats.
Mr Gerasimos Arsenis, the defence minister, has tried to build support among
the nationalists, while Mr Costas Simitis, the industry minister, is close
to the pro-Europeans. In the year since the Socialists returned to power,
both have been cultivating alliances in Pasok's central committee and in
grassroots party organisations.
However, both men are tainted in the eyes of Pasok supporters by having
quarrelled with Mr Papandreou in the past.
Recently, Mr Papandreou has a given a free hand in policy-making to several
younger cabinet ministers, among them Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy
minister who is enthusiastically re-launching privatisation in Greece.
The alternative to nominating a successor would be for Mr Papandreou to hand
over power to a collective leadership. It would probably have to be led by
the hard-working Mr Akis Tsochatzopoulos, Pasok's secretary general and Mr
Papandreou's most loyal political colleague.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Kinkel smooths path to coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiations to form Germany's next government looked likely to be smoother
than expected last night after the Free Democratic Party (FDP) emerged from
its own strategy talks more united than before.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the small liberal party
which has kept the present coalition in power since 1982, emerged from a
meeting of the party's national executive to present a negotiating team that
is unlikely to wrangle over details with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) and its more conservative sister party, the Christian
Social Union (CSU).
'We are not erecting barriers with demands that cannot be fulfilled,' Mr
Kinkel said.
The opening round of the coalition negotiations between the three parties
got under way last night. The CDU has said it wants negotiations to be
rounded off as quickly as possible, clearing the way for parliament to
re-elect Mr Kohl as chancellor in the week beginning November 14.
Mr Kinkel won an easy victory yesterday over Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former
economics minister who leads the party in North Rhine-Westphalia, its most
important state branch.
Mr Mollemann had tried last week to form a faction against Mr Kinkel, whom
he blames for the FDP's poor showing in elections earlier this month - its
second worst electoral result since 1949.
Some party members were hoping the FDP could use the coalition negotiations
to put a detailed catalogue of demands that would allow the party to present
itself as the liberal force in German politics, a tag it may be in danger of
losing to the Greens and other parties.
One issue bound to cause problems in the negotiations is the question of
dual nationality for foreigners living in Germany. The CSU has said it will
have nothing to do with such proposals.
Officials in Bonn said the coalition negotiations were likely to be carried
through by the central negotiating team which includes the three party
leaders. Time pressures meant that little would be handed down to the sort
of ad hoc committees created during the last negotiations in 1990.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Russia forecasts more stable economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia may achieve the basis for economic stabilisation in 1995 despite the
recent turbulence on the currency markets and a further contraction of
output, according to an economics ministry forecast presented to parliament
yesterday.
The ministry predicted that the fall in gross domestic product would slow to
6-8 per cent next year but that this would mask strong growth in Russia's
services sector, which some economists suggest is only inadequately recorded
in official statistics. An accompanying finance ministry report forecast the
year-on-year inflation rate would fall to 27-30 per cent by the end of 1995,
compared with 180 per cent in 1994, 840 per cent in 1993 and 2,000 per cent
in 1992.
'This bears witness to the first signs of stabilisation, or at least the
basis for stabilisation,' the economics ministry report said.
Mrs Tatyana Paramanova, the newly-appointed acting head of the central bank,
vowed she would use Russia's foreign exchange reserves to defend the rouble,
introducing greater exchange rate stability. In her first interview since
being nominated last week by President Boris Yeltsin, she also promised to
create a modern banking system in Russia, commensurate with the size of the
country, and to develop effective monetary policy instruments.
However, the government's relatively tough budgetary stance - symbolised by
a frugal draft budget for 1995 - will be severely tested in the coming weeks
as opposition intensifies. Parliament, which has been incensed by the
rouble's volatility, will hold a confidence vote on the government on
Thursday and some deputies are likely vigorously to oppose the 1995 budget
draft.
The trades union movement has also called for a national strike on the same
day to highlight the plight of thousands of workers who have not been paid
for months. It was reported yesterday that 73 workers had gone on hunger
strike in the Sverdlovsk region to protest about wage arrears at their
military equipment plant. Gen Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, has
already turned up the political heat, claiming that the proposed 1995
defence budget of Rbs44,000bn was insufficient for the armed forces.
Pressure from the defence, heavy industry and agriculture lobbies has
already resulted in a sizeable increase in credits this year.
The economics ministry report forecast Russia's trade surplus would rise
from Dollars 18.3bn in 1994 to Dollars 19.1bn next year - although this may
reflect a sharp projected fall in imports following the rouble's
depreciation.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Gaullists try to stem infighting over presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The increasingly aggressive edge to the rivalry for the French presidency
between Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac yesterday
brought yet another appeal for calm within the ruling Gaullist RPR party.
Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR as well as foreign minister,
wrote in yesterday's Le Monde newspaper that he was 'amazed at the
degradation of the political climate' in France, and urged the rivals
eventually to come to some understanding about which of them should run for
the Elysee.
But the past week has seen Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac reject each other's
overtures, and resort ever more to the dagger - and less to the cloak - in
their contest to run as the main conservative standard-bearer in next May's
elections.
In the apparently escalating power struggle, a new threshold was crossed
yesterday when, in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Balladur
complained that Mr Chirac had not spoken out in support of the government's
strong franc policy during the currency crisis of mid-1993 for fear of
offending the RPR, of which Mr Chirac is the president.
'For a long time, Jacques has taken refuge in his party as if it were a
citadel. Is this really the spirit of the Fifth Republic?', queried the
prime minister. Hitherto the two rivals have avoided attaching each other's
name to the darts they keep firing off. Mr Balladur's criticism of Mr Chirac
concerned an incident more than a year old.
However, it was couched in exactly the terms in which the Balladur camp
today sees Mr Chirac's fatal weakness - that the RPR president is simply too
partisan ever to win the Elysee, and that only Mr Balladur has enough
cross-party appeal to thwart a possible socialist contender like Mr Jacques
Delors. The opinion polls so far support this thesis. Mr Chirac's supporters
hit back yesterday. Mr Jean-Louis Debre, a senior RPR politician, criticised
the prime minister for his 'useless and irresponsible' words about Mr
Chirac.
Mr Debre reminded Mr Balladur that he had once put in writing that a prime
minister should concentrate on governing and stay out of politicking for the
Elysee.
The prospect of an increasingly bitter and politically destabilising
Gaullist civil war is, according to many bank economists in Paris, one of
many factors that has caused foreigners to pull their money out of French
stocks and bonds at the rate of FFr100bn (Pounds 12bn) in each of the first
three quarters of this year.
Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac differ more in style than policy, though over the
weekend Mr Chirac raised a further question mark over his commitment to
European monetary union (Emu) when he said the final decision to move to Emu
should be put to a referendum, just as the Maastricht treaty had been.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Pressure increases to stem tide of 'dirty money'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is growing pressure across the western world to clamp down on flows of
'dirty money', which some estimates put in France alone at about FFr14bn
(Pounds 1.7bn) a year and around the world at up to FFr1,000bn.
Mr Pierre Fond, deputy head of the French Tracfin agency which tracks
clandestine financial movements, says his organisation has referred 55 cases
involving more than FFr1bn in suspected money-laundering operations to the
courts over the past two years. It still now receiving about 60 tip-offs
each month from financial institutions of flows of dirty money.
The figures from Tracfin, which has began full-scale operations in the past
two years as a result of French money laundering laws passed in 1990, only
records the most suspicious transactions. Mr Fond says that is one reason
why the monthly reports coming into the agency are still substantially less
than those for its counterparts in countries such as Britain.
Tracfin's 25 agents work with about 4,000 'correspondents', one in each of
the financial institutions such as banks who monitor confidentially flows of
money which might be linked to criminal activities.
Mr Fond said one of the most difficult networks to monitor was bureaux de
change, because many were very small with only a few staff and often less
effective at keeping Tracfin informed.
He said money laundering prosecutions were often frustrated because it was
necessary to prove the original crime - often committed in another country -
as well as all the subsequent flows of money following from it. Also current
legislation allowed the agency to act only against laundering activities
from drug money and not other illegal activities such as fraud or public
sector corruption.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Monaco acts to cut down dirty laundry: Andrew Jack on moves
to stop crime cash flowing through the principality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While most towns have street signs that direct visitors to tourist
attractions, in Monte Carlo they come with a difference: the majority point
to banks.
Monaco's ability to attract capital makes itself quickly apparent to
visitors. It is in evidence in the expensive hotels and restaurants, in the
glamorous jewellery adorning those walking the streets, and above all in its
ornate, chandeliered casinos.
But there is a less pleasant aspect to some of the cash that gushes through
the peaceful city state. By virtue of its location, tight banking secrecy
rules and pace of economic growth, Monaco has in the past attracted more
than its fair share of the 'dirty money' of drug dealers and other
criminals.
The strength of the financial network in the principality is clearly visible
from the presence of a vast network of French and international banks - some
45 separate institutions, and many more individual branches in an area less
than two kilometres square.
Mr Pierre Fond, deputy head of Tracfin, the French agency created three
years ago to track clandestine financial movements, says that dirty money
does not often arrive directly in the form of cash deposited into banks or
other deposit-taking institutions such as bureaux de change. Instead, it may
be used to buy property, or fed through 'front companies' in sectors such as
those in construction and tourism with high cash turnover.
Equally, not all the money being laundered is drug-related. Growing trends
include the emergence of subsidies or kick-backs on public works contracts,
and fraud related to the European Union's agricultural programmes.
Investigators point to the east when seeking the origins of much of the
dirty money: just over the border along the southern coast of France lies
Italy, and Mafia money. However, money is now coming from criminal activity
further afield, notably in eastern Europe.
Mr Jean Pastorelli, financial and economic adviser Monaco's government,
denies that the principality has a money laundering problem of any great
size or that the state is ignoring the issue. However, a senior banker
admits that 'of course, it goes on', adding that the authorities have
clamped down in recent years in an effort to preserve Monaco's reputation.
Mr Fond says the principality presents no more of a problem as a conduit for
dirty money than do many parts of France or nearby states. But a report last
year by a French government commission examining ways to combat the advance
of the mafia highlighted the role of Monaco, along with that of Switzerland
and the Channel Islands, as important centres through which money could be
laundered en route to France.
Certainly Monaco has seen the need to follow a trend emerging among other
countries, triggered by a Group of Seven group on money laundering. It
introduced new legislation last year and has set up Siccfin, an agency akin
to France's Tracfin designed to follow the movement of suspected dirty
money.
Last week, the French and Monegasque authorities also signed a co-operation
agreement between Siccfin and Tracfin similar to those between France and
Belgium, Australia, the US and Italy. Its precise wording is confidential,
but it permits for the first time an official exchange of information, which
can be used to help track criminals and form the basis for prosecutions.
Mr Fond would like equivalent accords with countries such as Switzerland and
Luxembourg. Bringing criminals to justice is very difficult since the law
requires considerable evidence, including the need to prove the original
criminal act which generated dirty money - an act which often took place in
another country.
While Monaco's attempts to prevent money laundering may have been improved,
one aspect of the accord should also help maintain its position as an
important 'offshore' centre. The agreement explicitly forbids any financial
information passed between the criminal investigators to be handed on to
fiscal agencies. Tax evaders will continue to enjoy a high level of banking
secrecy.

FT  25 OCT 94 / UN fury at Serbs' broken promise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UN officials in Sarajevo, whose patience with all the Bosnian parties is
wearing thin, reacted with fury yesterday when Serb officials reneged on a
promise to allow free passage to 11 convoys of vitally needed fuel.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN envoy in former Yugoslavia, expressed his
'outrage' to the Bosnian Serb leadership and won a pledge that one of the
the convoys would be allowed to proceed, according to UN officials.
The so-called safe havens for Moslems which the UN has established in
eastern Bosnia are virtually out of fuel and other essentials because the
Serbs have not allowed any convoys through this month.
Meanwhile the Bosnian government army traded automatic fire with French
peacekeepers as it began withdrawing from the positions which it recently
established in defiance of the UN on the slopes of Mount Igman overlooking
Sarajevo.
In principle, this withdrawal should marginally improve the atmosphere and
clear the way for the convoys to start moving. But tension in the Sarajevo
area was stoked by news that 11 Serb soldiers had been killed by the
Moslem-led government army in a commando attack over the weekend.
UN officials say the row over the convoys is the latest sign that their own
room for manoeuvre in Bosnia, which has never been large, is shrinking.
'The behaviour of both parties is getting worse,' one UN official said.
'Peacekeeping requires consent, and at the moment that consent is begrudging
at best.'
UN commanders believe the Bosnian Serbs, militarily vulnerable and isolated
by their erstwhile protectors in Belgrade, are taking out their frustration
on the peacekeepers.
UN officials have also been irritated by what they view as provocative
behaviour by the Bosnian government, which has - in their view - taken
advantage of the almost uncritical support it enjoys in Washington.
Washington, frustrated by its allies' reluctance to authorise arms supplies
to Bosnia, has been emphasising its strong political commitment to the
leadership in Sarajevo, and keenness to see tougher use of air power against
the Serbs.
US officials are pointing to the hardship endured by Moslem civilians as an
argument for stepping up support to their government. But UN workers
privately retort that the Sarajevo leadership does not always co-operate
with their efforts to relieve civilian suffering.
General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, threatened at one
point last month to invoke Nato air strikes against the government army. But
he later had to admit that this threat was not a plausible one, given that
the US - Nato's most powerful member - would never allow its aircraft to be
used for that purpose.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Jury clears Walker of Pounds 19m fraud: Collapse of case
seen as further blow to credibility of Serious Fraud Office
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr George Walker, the one-time professional boxer turned leisure
entrepreneur, was cleared yesterday of orchestrating a Pounds 19m fraud at
Brent Walker, his former company, after a trial costing Pounds 5m and
lasting four and a half months.
'The case ruined three years of my life,' he said, expressing his relief at
the verdicts after leaving the courtroom in an annexe of the Old Bailey in
London's Chancery Lane.
'It is amazing,' he added. 'This is all too quick for me to feel happy. I
don't feel like celebrating because of the tension which has been too much -
more for my family than for me.'
Mr Walker, who had been accused of masterminding the fraudulent boosting of
Brent Walker profits by Pounds 19m during the 1980s, was cleared of all
charges of theft, conspiracy and false accounting brought against him by the
Serious Fraud Office.
The jury returned its verdicts after deliberating for seven days. It cleared
Mr Walker of three charges alleging the theft of Pounds 17m from Brent
Walker, the property and leisure group; one of conspiring to falsify the
company's accounts; and two of false accounting.
Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director, was convicted
by a 10-1 majority on one charge of false accounting relating to a Dollars
4m (Pounds 2.5m) payment by Brent Walker to an offshore company, but cleared
of four other charges of theft involving Pounds 9.5m and conspiracy to
falsify accounts.
Mr Aquilina was released on bail and will be sentenced at Southwark Crown
Court on November 10. His lawyers are considering an appeal against his
conviction.
The case was widely seen in both City and legal circles as a further blow to
the credibility of the SFO, the future of which looks uncertain.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, is considering proposals to place
the SFO under the control of the Crown Prosecution Service, as recommended
by an official government review.
With his decision expected within two months, the high-profile failure to
secure the conviction of Mr Walker has come at a highly sensitive time for
the SFO.
Of the charges brought against him, Mr Walker said: 'It was just a story
backed up by 'ifs'.' He said that a lot of the time in court it was
'impossible to know what the SFO was on about'.
Mr Walker said he was contemplating rebuilding his business career in the
leisure industry. 'I do think I have something to give,' he said, adding
that he had already been contacted with business propositions.
Mr Walker was made bankrupt in 1993 after being dismissed from Brent Walker.
He was particularly vitriolic about the role of the company's bank creditors
in dismissing him, having him declared bankrupt and encouraging the SFO to
prosecute. 'It was the banks who wanted me bankrupt,' he said.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Fayed and Rowland row over pay-to-MPs video claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year's fragile ceasefire between Mr Mohamed Fayed and Mr Tiny Rowland
came to an abrupt end yesterday as they argued about the alleged contents of
a video recording of Mr Rowland - and even about when the recording or
recordings may have been made.
Mr Fayed said that as part of the truce in the long-running legal battle
with Mr Rowland - which began when Mr Fayed and his brothers snatched
control of Harrods department store from under Mr Rowland's nose in 1985 -
the joint chief executive of Lonrho had consented to make a video recording
about political payments he had made.
'We had a BBC cameraman,' said Mr Fayed. 'I interviewed him like David
Frost.'
Mr Fayed said the video contained details of political payments made by
Lonrho exceeding Pounds 1m. However, Mr Rowland, barely able to contain his
laughter, denied last night that any such video had been made: 'You know
there is no man like him (Mr Fayed),' he said. 'I would love to see this
recording.'
He added: 'I can tell you we have never paid a penny to anyone employed in
government.'
Last week, Mr Fayed's disclosures about his payments to MPs led to the
resignation of one minister, Mr Tim Smith, and has put in question the
survival in office of Mr Neil Hamilton, a minister at the department of
trade and industry.
Mr Rowland disclosed that he had lunched with Mr Fayed for 'one and a half
hours' last Thursday in Mr Fayed's Harrods' office. 'He kept asking 'did you
pay Pounds  1/2 m or Pounds 1 1/2 m?',' Mr Rowland said.
Mr Rowland said he was convinced it was this meeting that was recorded. 'I
was a little bit concerned at the time,' he said. Mr Fayed, however, said it
was not taped.
Mr Fayed remains bitter about the appointment of inspectors in 1987 to
investigate his takeover of House of Fraser, owner of Harrods, two years
earlier. He believes his alleged tape recording of Mr Rowland sheds light on
the reasons for the appointment.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Major prepares defence in sleaze outcry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major was drawing up plans last night to defuse the charges of
sleaze levelled against his government as Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, distanced himself from the mounting political controversy.
But a left-right split opened in the cabinet over the fate of Mr Neil
Hamilton, the industry minister at the centre of allegations made by Mr
Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods.
Mr Major's attempts to develop a clear strategy before the inevitable
challenges at today's prime minister's questions came as Mr Howard was drawn
into a war of words between the government and Mr Fayed.
Amid controversy over the processing of a citizenship application submitted
by Mr Fayed's brother, Mr Howard issued a detailed statement clarifying his
role.
He said he had deputed the consideration of the application of Mr Ali Fayed
to Mr Charles Wardle, the junior home office minister responsible for
immigration. His own role had been limited to suggesting further inquiries
before a decision was taken.
The application is still pending, and Mr Jack Straw, the shadow home
secretary, called for a full Commons statement by Mr Howard. Mr Straw also
questioned whether Mr Wardle should have been given responsibility for the
decision. He pointed to a stinging attack on the Fayed brothers made by Mr
Wardle as a backbench MP in 1990.
With Mr Hamilton's ministerial future in doubt, Mr Major indicated his
readiness to publish the outcome of an inquiry conducted by Sir Robin
Butler, the cabinet secretary, into the so-called 'cash-for-questions'
allegations against two ministers. One, Mr Tim Smith, resigned last week,
but Mr Hamilton insisted that he had done nothing improper.
The prime minister was studying ways of broadening the present
investigations into the financial interests of MPs and of securing an end to
Labour's boycott of an inquiry by the House of Commons privileges committee.
One possibility floated last night by Tory party managers was that Mr Major
would signal his willingness to include independent figures from outside the
Commons in a wide-ranging study of potential conflicts of interest.
Senior Conservatives acknowledged that Mr Hamilton's position in the
government had grown weaker by the day since the charge levelled against him
last week by Mr Fayed that he had taken a free holiday at the Ritz hotel in
Paris.
At the weekend Mr David Hunt, the cabinet minister responsible for open
government, gave a clear hint that Mr Hamilton should stand down from the
government while fighting a libel action.
But Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary and, like Mr Hamilton, a
right-winger, pointedly defended his colleague. 'He should be allowed to
defend himself while (still) a minister,' Mr Portillo told BBC radio.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Heathrow subsidence halts tube tunnelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work on part of the Pounds 1.9bn London Underground Jubilee line extension
was halted yesterday pending the outcome of an investigation into serious
subsidence at Heathrow Airport.
Tunnelling was stopped on two sections of the line, at London Bridge and
Waterloo stations, because contractors are using the same tunnelling method
suspected of causing the Heathrow collapse.
The problems at Heathrow started on Friday when earth began slipping into
the railway tunnel near the terminal three car park during construction of
the Pounds 300m Heathrow express rail link to Paddington station. The London
Underground station for terminal four is closed as is the car park for
terminal three.
Heathrow said flight departures were normal yesterday, and delays were no
different from usual. On Sunday flights were up to 40 minutes late as
airlines waited for passengers who had been delayed in arriving.
The car park at terminal three is likely to remain closed until Thursday at
the earliest, although Heathrow officials hope that traffic to the airport
will have returned to normal by then.
An inquiry is under way at Heathrow into the cause of the collapse. BAA, the
airport operator, which is building the fast rail link in partnership with
the British Railways Board, said it would take at least 10 days to find out
what caused the tunnel collapse.
Balfour Beatty, the contracting arm of BICC, the quoted UK cables company,
is undertaking the construction work and was yesterday working to prevent
further slippage. BICC's shares closed down 13p yesterday at 333p.
Balfour Beatty said that until the cause of the subsidence was known it
would be impossible to estimate the overall cost of the incident or to
apportion blame.
In addition to a Pounds 60m tunnelling contract at Heathrow, Balfour Beatty
is one of the main contractors on the Jubilee line extension, with Taylor
Woodrow, Costain and AMEC.
The probe into the collapse has focused on the tunnelling technique, known
as the new Austrian tunnelling method.
Instead of using a cumbersome boring machine to cut the tunnel, sections are
dug out with an excavator before being temporarily reinforced with wire mesh
and concrete.
This technique is used mainly for intricate work around stations; most of
the 16-kilometre Jubilee line route is being cut using traditional methods.

FT  25 OCT 94 / Morgan Stanley in Chinese bank deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morgan Stanley of the US and the People's Construction Bank of China agreed
yesterday to set up China's first international investment bank, aimed at
making it easier to raise capital abroad to satisfy the country's huge
funding requirements for economic development.
The bank, to be known as China International Capital Corporation Limited
(CICC), will also be used as a model to help to introduce new investment
banking techniques to an antiquated financial sector undergoing reform.
Mr John Mack, president of Morgan Stanley Group, the US investment bank,
said at a signing ceremony in Beijing that the CICC would be well positioned
as a conduit for a country with a 'tremendous appetite for international
capital to fund its economic expansion and the development of its
infrastructure'.
Partners in CICC, whose initial capital is Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m),
include the People's Construction Bank with a 42.5 per cent stake; Morgan
Stanley with 35 per cent; and three other shareholders, each with 7.5 per
cent.
The minority shareholders are: the Government of Singapore Investment
Corporation (GSIC); the China National Investment and Guarantee Corporation,
a Chinese investment guarantee institution; and the Mingly Corporation, a
Hong Kong-based investment company.
The investment bank, to be based in Beijing, will also advise Chinese state
enterprises on restructuring, assist in project financing and
corporatisation - turning state enterprises into western-style corporations
 -and help foreign investors to make direct investments in Chinese
enterprises.
Morgan Stanley representatives said the People's Construction Bank was an
'obvious choice' as a partner because it is China's biggest lender for
infrastructure projects. The bank, for example, has been responsible for 80
per cent of the funding for power projects.
The People's Construction Bank, one of China's 'big four' specialised banks,
will 'identify investment opportunities in infrastructure projects and
industrial facilities, introduce potential restructuring, corporatisation
and mergers-and-acquisitions candidates and (seek out) Chinese partners for
joint ventures', according to Morgan Stanley.

FT  25 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (5):
Structure has been simplified - Andrew Hill says the telecoms industry has a
difficult task ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 8th November 1994) appended to this article.
If Italy's state-controlled telecommunications companies have one advantage
over their counterparts in other European countries, it is that their
customers love to talk.
That does not just mean Italians make a lot of phone calls from home. They
are also Europe's most flamboyant users of mobile telephones - telefonini -
flaunted everywhere from the tables of the local trattoria to the
pillion-seat of scooters.
This phenomenon has brought a smile to the face of executives at Telecom
Italia, the state-controlled telephone operator, and its parent Stet in
particular, because they are preparing Telecom Italia's mobile telephone
operations for a potentially lucrative demerger and flotation before the end
of the year.
But despite successful attempts at modernisation over the past decade,
Italy's telecoms industry still has a difficult task ahead over the next
five years if it is to compete internationally in a fast-changing sector.
At least the structure of the Italian telecoms sector has been simplified in
the past six months. Until recently, separate state-owned companies, each
with a different corporate identity, worked in parallel, sometimes on tasks
which overlapped. Earlier this year, however, it was agreed that Italy's
five telecoms operating companies, headed by Sip, the domestic telephone
operator, should be merged to form Telecom Italia.
Stet now owns some 60 per cent of Telecom Italia together with other
holdings in areas such as manufacturing and software, and international
joint ventures such as Stream, the multimedia company jointly owned with
Bell Atlantic of the US. Stet is itself 65 per cent owned by IRI, the state
holding company, and the outstanding shares in Stet and Telecom Italia are
traded on the Milan stock exchange.
'We took a great step forward when we agreed on this merger between the five
companies,' says Mr Umberto Silvestri, chairman of Telecom Italia and former
chief executive at Stet, who identifies the change of management culture at
the 60-year-old monopoly as one of his main challenges. But there are at
least four other important areas in which Stet and Telecom Italia must act
quickly:
Liberalisation. Like rivals in other European Union countries, Italy will
have to meet a deadline of 1998 for the introduction of competition in voice
telephony. This may prove to be more of a challenge in Italy than elsewhere,
because its tariffs are further out of line with the international average
than those in other European countries. In particular, international calls
from Italy are among the most expensive in Europe and business users are
already taking advantage of private call-back services which capitalise on
cheaper US rates, for example.
Further rebalancing of tariffs in April has reduced the discrepancies but
there is still more work to be done. For example, according to Telecom
Italia it now costs more to call Italy from the US than vice versa, but Mr
Silvestri still estimates that the price of international calls will have to
come down by about a quarter and local tariffs increase by about the same
amount.
The role of an independent regulatory authority - yet to be established in
Italy - will also be crucial in making sure that Telecom Italia does not
abuse its dominant position on the market after liberalisation, particularly
as Italy is proving slow to implement existing directives opening up
specialised telecoms services to competition. Earlier this month, a Milan
court ruled that Sip-Telecom Italia, in line with European Union rules,
would have to offer leased lines to Telsystem, a small telecoms services
company, a move widely interpreted as opening a crack in the domestic
operator's monopoly.
Investment. Stet and Telecom Italia have both been investing heavily to
modernise the much-criticised Italian telephone system. Telecom Italia, for
example, invested L9,500bn in 1992 and more than L10,000bn last year. In
1994, that figure will drop to about L9,500bn, and again in the years
leading up to 1998, but the overall amount invested over the six years
between 1992 and 1998 is still likely to be more than L50,000bn.
Much of that has been spent on bringing the Italian network up to scratch,
and adapting it to the likely demand for high technology multimedia
services. Telecom Italia is set to spend some L2,000bn in the next three
years specifically to ease the growth of a market for, say, video on demand
or sophisticated tele-shopping.
At the moment, some 60 per cent of Telecom Italia's investment is financed
by debt, and 40 per cent from internal funding. Mr Silvestri hopes that by
the end of 1997 that ratio will be reversed.
Privatisation. 'The sale of IRI's remaining shares in Stet is now unlikely
to take place before the middle of 1995, probably after the flotation of the
cellular phone business. Both events are keenly awaited by international
investors, and by the telecoms companies themselves, which have been
constrained by their inability to raise finance through share issues because
of IRI's unwillingness to stump up cash for its rights.
A merger between Stet and Telecom Italia - which would give the Italian
telecoms sector an even simpler structure - now seems unlikely for practical
reasons, but the sell-off should be eased by the fact that Mr Michele
Tedeschi, chairman of IRI since the summer, used to be chief executive of
Stet.
As this survey went to press, IRI was preparing to choose advisers for the
Stet sell-off. They will have to decide what sort of mechanism to install to
prevent Stet's 'strategic importance' being compromised. A 'golden share' is
likely to be one possibility, or the formation of a hard core of large
investors, dominated by Italian companies and institutions.
International weight. In terms of market value, Telecom Italia and Stet are
already the biggest industrial companies listed on the Italian stock market.
Following the merger, Telecom Italia can count on a total annual turnover of
L2,700bn, and a net profit of at least L1,025bn. It is the sixth-largest
telecoms operator in the world, after NTT of Japan, AT&amp;T of the US and the
German, French and British national operators. But Italian telecoms
executives concede that this is not weighty enough, particularly as most
rivals are rapidly forming international alliances.
Telecom Italia is in discussion with 'three or four' medium-sized companies
in the hope of finding a partner. Without such a deal, Telecom Italia and
Stet risk being left behind in the race to be one of the five or six big
operators which most analysts believe will dominate the world telecoms
market at the beginning of the next century.
CORRECTION
In the FT survey on Italian Industry and Technology, published on October
25, the article on the telecoms sector stated that 60 per cent of Telecom
Italia's investment was financed by debt, and 40 per cent from internal
resources. The company points out that those figures refer to the coverage
of capital invested as at December 31 1993, before the merger of state-owned
telecoms companies, and not to annual investment, which is financed entirely
from internal resources. In 1994, Telecom Italia expects capital expenditure
to be more than covered by cash-flow.
The annual turnover of the company in the 1993 pro forma profit and loss
account was approximately L27,000bn (Dollars 17.27bn) and not L2,700bn, as
incorrectly reported.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Indosat highlights faith in telecom
privatisations - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The enthusiasm of international investors for shares in Indosat, the
Indonesian telecoms group, which rose 20 per cent in their first day of
trading, has put under the spotlight one of Asia's most rapidly growing
emerging markets.
It has also served to underline another significant trend: the enthusiasm of
securities houses, banks and institutional investors for freshly privatised
telecommunications businesses, but some analysts are questioning whether
investors are becoming over-enthusiastic.
There is no doubting bankers' enthusiasm. The industry is set to bring
Dollars 100bn in offerings to the global markets within the next five years
and bankers can expect to earn in the region of Dollars 3bn in fees from
these deals. Securities houses are gearing up for a sharp rise in telecoms
offerings - increasing the size of their analytical teams is just one
method.
The Indosat deal has been carried on a wave of enthusiasm which has affected
other global telecom offers:
Pakistan raised Dollars 900m when it sold 10 per cent of Pakistan Telecom.
The government had originally aimed to raise just Dollars 500m.
The value of ADRs in Telmex, Mexico's telecommunication company privatised
in 1991, has increased from Dollars 27 to Dollars 60.
The Indian government plans to sell part of its 85 per cent stake in VSNL,
the international telecommunications monopoly, at a price of about Rs1,100 a
share - which one banker reckoned as '35 times earnings'.
Other countries planning privatisations or sell-offs include Belgium, Italy,
Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey and Hungary. Potential privatisations later
in the decade include Brazil, South Africa and South Korea.
However, some specialists are suggesting that investors may be losing sight
of the risks. 'One warning sign is the almost unanimous view that
telecommunications investments carry low risk,' says Mr Rod Dowler, head of
Technology Consulting, a specialist advisory company, and formerly head of
KPMG's telecoms consultancy. 'This echoes the assertion that countries
cannot go broke or property is always a safe investment, that accompanied
previous investment stampedes.'
He warns that newly privatised companies could be artificially attractive
because of their monopoly in local markets and could be hit by the emergence
of competition.
The question of valuing a telecoms company has been addressed by Baring
Securities, which held a seminar on the subject in Cambridge last month.
Baring's model looks at the territory covered and growth potential.
This question of valuation may be highlighted by the sale of part of OTE,
the Greek telecoms operator, which is due this year. At first sight it has
all the attractions of an emerging market telecom company but a close
examination reveals that there may be less potential for growth.
The penetration of telephone lines in Greece, at about 47 per hundred
people, is not far short of the European average. Athens is not a major
commercial hub, and servicing the myriad Greek islands will be expensive.
One analyst values OTE at Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn, yet the Greek
government hopes it will be valued at Dollars 5.2bn. 'I'm sceptical. I don't
see it as a red hot deal,' he said.
Another analyst says that although telecoms are one of the few utilities
with good growth prospects 'it is very easy to get too excited and pay silly
prices'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / VW eases concern on Skoda cuts: Czech government asks German
carmaker to amend plans to scale down production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE COOK and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the German motor group, has moved to calm Czech anger over the
scaling down of its production targets for the Skoda carmaker by promising
to meet some of the Prague government's objections.
VW and the Czech government said yesterday they were confident that talks
over the German group's revised plans for Skoda, based north of Prague,
could be concluded this year. The statement came after Mr Ferdinand Piech,
VW's chairman, met Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech industry and trade
minister, in Prague on Saturday.
The government is mainly concerned over VW's decision to scale down annual
production from a previous target of 400,000 cars to 300,000 cars by the
year 2000. Although VW gave no details of the meeting, it is understood the
extent of the scale-down may be reduced in line with Czech objections.
The two sides said further talks would be held on amending VW's original
plans. VW owns 31 per cent of Skoda, scheduled to rise to 50.5 per cent this
year.
Under a 1991 agreement, VW is due to increase its stake in Skoda to 70 per
cent by the end of 1995 at a total cost of DM1.4bn (Pounds 575m) - the
biggest foreign investment in the Czech Republic. VW promised to invest a
further DM6.8bn over 10 years in Skoda to introduce new models, double
production to 400,000 cars by 2000 and build a plant to produce 400,000
engines a year, half for other VW subsidiaries.
But because of losses at Seat, its Spanish subsidiary, VW said the proposed
engine plant was no longer feasible and it would cut investment to DM3.75bn.
Mr Dlouhy suggested that the German company had violated the spirit of the
contract and said he would seek an amendment which would require VW to
fulfil its promise.
Mr Dlouhy said before the meeting with Mr Piech that he expected by the end
of October to sign 'a amendment to the contract that will put VW and the
Czech government on an even footing'. The talks come a week after 10,000
workers at Skoda's factory in Mlada Boleslav, north of Prague, staged a
one-hour strike over plans to make 855 employees redundant, and days before
the company launches its new Felicia car, Skoda's first new product since
1988.
Also under discussion will be VW's plans to import engines for some versions
of the Felicia and to put employees of Skoda parts suppliers on its assembly
lines. Mr Jan Uhlir, who as chairman of the Kovo Trade Union which
represents most of Skoda's 17,000 workers, has been in talks with the
Skoda-VW management.

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The conservative candidate for mayor of Athens, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos,
yesterday inflicted a humiliating defeat on Mr Theodoros Pangalos, a former
European affairs minister who was standing for the governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (Pasok).
Mr Pangalos conceded defeat shortly after the polls closed, when computer
projections indicated Mr Avramopoulos, a former diplomat who entered
politics only a year ago, would win with 55.1 per cent of the vote.
Mr Pangalos claimed Athens had 'lost an historic opportunity' in Greece's
nationwide local elections because left-wing Athenians failed to back him in
the yesterday's crucial second round of voting. But he said he would lead a
citizens' movement to improve the quality of life in the city.
The Athens result reflected voter dissatisfaction with Pasok's restrictive
economic policies since its return to power in 1993, but was also a protest
against Mr Pangalos' campaigning style.
Mr Pangalos, known for his outspoken comments about other politicians,
appeared to have turned undecided voters against him because of repeated
personal attacks on Mr Avramopoulos.
His defeat may also have an impact on his chances of succeeding Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou as Pasok leader. The leadership struggle is
intensifying, with Mr Papandreou expected to stand down as premier in order
to run for the Greek presidency next spring.
Mr Avramopoulos is a member of the opposition New Democracy party and his
victory in Athens gives the party control of Greece's two largest cities as
Mr Constantine Kosmopoulos, mayor of Thessaloniki, was re-elected in the
first-round vote of the country's local government elections a week earlier.
However, Mr Spyros Logothetis, the Pasok candidate, appeared set to win
second-round voting yesterday in Athens' port of Piraeus.
First returns also showed Pasok doing well in second-round voting in the
countryside and for provincial governors.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Dubbing actors strike for a slice more of the action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Talk is cheap. Too cheap, claim the actors who dub foreign films and
television programmes for French audiences.
Actors belonging to the three unions which represent France's dubbing
artists have been on strike since Tuesday. They want recognition of their
intellectual property rights which, they believe, entitle them to payments
for repeats and reissues of films, television series and videos.
The stoppage threatens television and film companies and at least one major
film, Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein, faces a potentially serious hitch in
its preparations for the French market. 'The unions are holding us hostage,'
said one official of the Chambre de Doublage et de la Synchronisation, the
industry association for France's dubbing companies.
All is not lost. A meeting tomorrow between union members, film and
television companies and the industry body, is aimed at resolving
disagreements and restoring the voices to foreign television stars and
Frankenstein.
But the various parties will have to solve a complex and protracted dispute.
The actors claim that a law passed in 1985, which took effect in 1986,
upholds their intellectual property rights and entitles them to be consulted
and remunerated before their work is re-broadcast or re-sold.
'We own our interpretation of a role,' said Mr Jimmy Shuman, an actor and a
member of the Syndicat Francais des Artistes-Interpretes, one of the actors'
unions. He claims that a new collective agreement between the actors and the
dubbing companies, signed in April, allowed for negotiations on additional
payments for re-broadcasts. The failure to arrange negotiations and the
'ambiguous response' from management and industry companies forced the
industrial action, Mr Shuman said.
The dubbing companies and their clients have been taken by surprise. 'We
were not expecting a strike,' said Mr Jacques Orth, president of the Chambre
Syndicale. He denied that actors had an automatic right to repeat fees, and
said that the complex legal issues about property rights needed government
clarification.
Mr Orth believes the current stoppage could be damaging for the French
dubbing industry. 'Major film companies will be tempted to go elsewhere,
maybe to Belgium, Switzerland or even Britain.' The unions respond that this
possibility is blocked by a decree that non-European films must be dubbed in
France for the domestic market.
If the legal arguments are unclear, so are the financial implications.
Neither the companies nor the unions have sought to quantify the potential
costs, although some artists could have much to gain. 'If you take the case
of the guy who did Hutch, in Starsky &amp; Hutch, then his work has been
repeated eight times,' one union member said.
But the stoppage may harden the attitudes of the dubbers. As one actor put
it: 'With people staying at home, many will see their work being
re-broadcast on TV, reminding them of the money they are losing out on.'

Knesset to ratify deal
Israel's parliament meets to ratify the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty.
Israel has invited 2,000 Jordanians, 2,000 Israelis and 1,000 Americans to
witness what is expected to be a near unanimous approval of Israel's second
peace treaty with an Arab neighbour since its accord with Egypt in 1979.
European Union Agriculture:
Agriculture ministers meet in Luxembourg to discuss, among other things,
measures to introduce maximum journey limits to protect animals from being

European Parliament begins a week-long session in Strasbourg.
South Africa's foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, kept busy by all the official
invitations his once isolated country now receives, arrives in Saudi Arabia
at the start of a week-long tour of the Middle East. He also visits Oman,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Iran, with which South Africa has had no official
contact since the Iranian revolution. He then visits the Czech Republic and
France.
Somalia: A seven-member United Nations security council mission leaves for
Mogadishu to prepare for the phased withdrawal of the 15,000-strong UN
operation by the end of March. The US-led intervention in December 1992
delivered food, but failed to bring about national reconciliation.
Kurdish rights: John Shattuck, US assistant secretary of state for human
rights, visits south-eastern Turkey, where security forces a month ago
launched one of their largest offensives against the separatist Kurdistan
Workers Party (PKK). International organisations accuse the army of
systematic human rights violations in a 10-year war against the PKK that has
claimed over 13,000 lives.
Ulster peace: British prime minister John Major is due to hold talks with
Ireland's premier Albert Reynolds at Chequers, Mr Major's country retreat
near London. They will review progress on peace in Northern Ireland, and
prepare for a summit when they are expected to release the long awaited
framework document for a settlement.
The meeting will confirm the leaders' joint approach, although Mr Major will
want to restate British concerns not to alienate the unionists, while Mr
Reynolds will repeat his view that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
should be brought into talks as soon as possible to maintain momentum.

World Trade Organisation
The preparatory committee meets in Geneva to decide whether to go ahead with
an implementing conference in December to set a January 1 starting date for
the successor to Gatt. Only 30 out of the 125 participants in the world
trade talks have ratified the accords so far, but another 50, including the
US, EU and Japan, have pledged to ratify by the end of the year.
German government: Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, its
Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union, and the Free Democratic
party (FDP), begin what could be complicated coalition negotiations after
their victory in last week's federal elections. The FDP is under pressure to
give up some of the five ministries it controls in the 18-seat cabinet,
following its second worst election result since the second world war.
However, the three-party coalition has a majority in the Bundestag, the
lower house of parliament, of only 10 seats, a delicate situation which may
strengthen the FDP's negotiating hand.
Jacques Santer, European Union president-designate, meets Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky in Vienna to discuss the role of an Austrian
commissioner in the Commission to start work next year when Austria becomes
a member. The agriculture portfolio is said to be on offer. Mr Vranitzky
says he would appoint Franz Fischler, the (Conservative) agriculture
minister, for the post.
Germany's six economic institutes present their autumn survey, the most
comprehensive independent check-up on the state of the German economy.

Mr Clinton, the first serving US president to visit the heartland of the
Middle East since Jimmy Carter in 1979, is expected to spend the night in
Jordan. On Thursday he is due to address the Israeli parliament and visit
the Old City of Jerusalem. On Friday Mr Clinton will visit US troops in
Kuwait.
UK pollution: The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution publishes a
study of transport and the environment. The report is expected to recommend
stiff tax increases on petrol among more than 100 measures to slow down the
growth in private car use.
UK gas market: The House of Commons Select Committee on Trade and Industry

over whether to include gas deregulation in the Queen's Speech outlining the
government's legislative programme. Witnesses include Tim Eggar, UK energy
minister, Clare Spottiswoode, gas industry regulator, and senior executives
from British Gas.
Saleroom: In New York from Wednesday through to Friday, Christie's is
disposing of the French furniture and works of art which occupied the New
York mansion of the late Miss Alice Tully, a Corning Glass heiress, until
her death in 1993. Among the highlights are a Louis XVI ormolu mounted
mahogany secretaire, attributed to Reisener, the great master of the period,
and estimated at up to Dollars 150,000.
The private collection of arms and armour assembled by the late A. R. Dufty,
former Master of the Royal Armouries, is offered by Christie's in London.
Among the highlights is a silver gilt presentation small-sword in original
scabbard and case. It was given to Captain Thomas Le Marchant in 1798 after
he successfully took a convoy to the Leeward Islands during the French Wars.
Mr Dufty paid Pounds 230 for it in 1961; it now carries an estimate of up to
Pounds 12,000.

Aid for Ukraine
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma meets senior officials of the G7 nations,
IMF, World Bank and other finance officials in Winnipeg, Canada, to discuss
aid to Ukraine. He will press for up to Dollars 5.5bn to support the
country's nascent economic reforms. The US and Canada are due to raise
bilateral support to help cover a Dollars 600m balance of payments gap in
the fourth quarter. In return, they will urge Ukraine to accede to the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty and close the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant. Mr Kuchma should arrive in Winnipeg with a Dollars 360m credit from
the IMF, if initial macroeconomic reform steps satisfy the fund's board,
scheduled to vote on Wednesday.
Japan Tobacco, a privatisation issue rejected by nearly two-thirds of the
small investors who were offered shares, is to be listed on Tokyo, Nagoya
and Osaka stock exchanges. The first day's trading will prove whether small
investors were right to think the shares over-priced, at Y1.438m each.
Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party which has four MPs at Westminster,
starts its annual conference in Llandudno, north Wales (to Oct 30). In the
wake of the Labour Party's commitment to a Welsh assembly, delegates will be
pressing the case for a parliament with tax-raising powers.

FRIDAY 28
Mozambique holds election
Two days of voting end in the country's first multi-party elections, amid
fears that it could go the way of Angola, which returned to civil war when
Jonas Savimbi refused to accept defeat in the 1992 election. President
Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party and Renamo, the former rebel
movement led by Afonso Dhlakama, are the main contenders for the presidency
and a 250-seat parliament. Some 2,000 UN and other observers will determine
whether the exercise is free and fair.
US economy: Analysts expect today's 'advance' US gross domestic product
figures to confirm a slow-down in the annualised rate of US growth to 2.8
per cent in the third quarter from the second quarter's robust 4.1 per cent.
The GDP deflator, the broadest measure of inflation, could be of greater
interest for financial markets if figures substantiate consensus forecasts
of a rise to 3 per cent from 2.9 per cent in the second quarter.
Malaysia's 1995 budget is presented today. A 2 per cent cut in corporation
tax to 30 per cent is expected as part of package to offer more incentives
to foreign and local investors. Restrictions on domestic credit are also
probable, to prevent the economy from overheating after seven years of above
8 per cent growth.

WEEKEND 29-30
Scramble for EU portfolios
European Commission president- designate Jacques Santer holds an informal
meeting of commissioners- designate at Chateau Senningen in Luxembourg on
Saturday to discuss the allocation of portfolios. Failure to secure a deal
would be viewed as a blow to Santer's authority.
Macedonia holds a second round of elections for its 120-seat parliament on
Sunday. The Alliance for Macedonia coalition, led by ex-communists and
backed by President Kiro Gligorov, is expected to finish first after winning
some 30 per cent of the first-round vote, according to unofficial figures.
The Alliance is likely to resume governing with the Party for Democratic
Prosperity, representing Macedonia's sizeable ethnic Albanian minority.
Casablanca hosts the Middle East/North Africa Economic Summit on Sunday (to
Nov 1). Organised by the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic
Forum, it brings together 200 political leaders from 40 countries and 1,000
business people.
The conference aims to provide the economic foundations for a peaceful
Middle East after Israel's recent peace agreements with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation and with Jordan.
Clocks go back one hour in Canada, the US and Mexico on Sunday.

Tuesday: The Conference Board's US consumer confidence index for October is
expected to rise slightly to 89 after falling for the past four months.
Wednesday: US durable goods orders have been a volatile indicator of late
because of sharp movements in the transport category. The consensus of
analysts' views, polled by MMS International, is for a 0.5 per cent rise in
September.
Friday: There are few signs of a pick-up in Japanese consumer price
inflation. Consensus forecasts suggest the Tokyo consumer price index for
October will show a year-on-year rise of just 0.4 per cent, while the
all-nation index for September will be just 0.2 per cent up on September
last year.
During the week: The expected fall in western German consumer price
inflation to 2.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis in October, from 2.9 per
cent in September, should reflect lower service price inflation. Morgan
Grenfell, the UK investment bank owned by Deutsche Bank, expects a 'more
convincing downward trend' in German CPI inflation to 2.2 per cent by the
end of March next year.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Investors back in a wary phase - New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since midsummer, interest rate jitters have waxed and waned on Wall Street
with the regularity of a lunar cycle. Over a two-week period, concern over
monetary policy would build up and dominate sentiment. Over the following
fortnight, the fears and uncertainty would dissipate. The pattern has
repeated itself several times.
This week investors are back in a wary phase. Most of the bellwether
companies have already posted their third-quarter results, taking away a
potent diversion. Meanwhile, the recent economic data indicate the economy
is accelerating, rattling bonds.
There was news that builders had broken ground on new residential housing at
the fastest pace since last December, before the harsh winter commenced and
the Fed began tightening credit conditions. The spurt of construction
suggested that the Federal Reserve will have to lift rates again soon to
cool the economy.
A sixth boost in short-term rates is not a welcome prospect for stocks. The
reporting season thus far has produced many more pleasant surprises than
disappointments, but investors are wondering how long earnings can continue
to grow, with borrowing becoming increasingly expensive.
The mood swing on Wall Street since last Monday morning is quite evident,
even though stocks had been expected to meet technical resistance in making
much headway during the week.
With most of the results out of the way the focus has shifted again to the
bond market, and the picture there is not very pretty for shareholders.
On Friday, the benchmark 30-year bond yield broke through 8.00 per cent, an
important marker, before receding a little. It was a red flag for equity
investors who fear the higher returns will divert investment from stocks.
Though such buying might allow bonds to hold steady, further declines are
not out of the question ahead of Friday's fresh estimate of third-quarter
GDP. Many economists are expecting an upward revision.
The interplay between bonds and stocks is complicated by renewed weakness in
the dollar. Equity investors are looking closely at the dollar's movements
against the D-Mark and yen. As the US currency goes, bonds and stocks will
probably follow.
With interest rates back on centre stage, late-comers reporting quarterly
results will be a sideshow.
Ford, the last of the Big Three to release, has piqued some curiosity. With
Chyrsler doing better than expected and General Motors a big disappointment,
investors are eager to see how the number two car maker performed in the
quarter.
Wall Street is also anxious to learn how Kodak fared. A cost-cutting
programme implemented earlier this month suggests the company is struggling
to meet its operating targets.

The market is set to drift into another week of listless trading, marked by
thin turnover, writes Louise Lucas.
Investors will once again take their cues from overseas, with economic data
coming from China and the US continuing to spook sentiment in the colony.
At home, hints of a resolution to the financing of the new airport could be
sufficient to spur the market upwards.
In the absence of corporate news, and with the reporting season now
effectively wrapped up, many share price movements have been driven by
little more than rumours, and these are expected to persist.
Futures are also likely to continue to be a driving force, following the
pattern set last week.
Last Friday the turnover on October futures was some two and a half times
that on the cash market.

Investors are expected to remain cautious ahead of Thursday's listing of
Japan Tobacco, writes Emiko Terazono.
Only about 10 per cent of the second round of subscribers are thought to
have bought the stock, and brokers estimate that 60 per cent of the offered
shares remain unsold.
This means that unless the ministry of finance decides to unload the unsold
shares on to the market on Thursday, the potential number of sellers of the
stock remains lower than initial expectations.
Some market participants expect that this will support investor confidence
after the listing, prompting the stock market to rally.
Meanwhile, investors are also expected to remain cautious if the currency
market remains volatile.
A further strengthening of the yen against the dollar could prompt a brief
sell-off of high-technology stocks.

Irish Permanent, Ireland's largest building society before it converted to
plc status, is listed in Dublin and London on Thursday, in an otherwise
quiet week. Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin note that the market is down about 3
per cent so far this year and is about 12 per cent off its January 1994
high. Mr Robbie Kelleher says that because this price weakness has occurred
at a time of exceptionally strong earnings growth, the market is now trading
on multiples that are at the bottom end of the range that has been
experienced over the past decade, and he sees plenty of scope for price
appreciation.

Sandoz rounds off the big three pharmaceutical stocks' nine-month reporting
season tomorrow when it is expected to report consolidated sales increasing
to SFr11.7bn from SFr11.5bn a year earlier. Turnover is expected to rise by
about 7 per cent in local currency terms, with the strength of the Swiss
franc cutting the advance in francs. Shares in Ciba and Roche have both been
under pressure after their nine-month figures, with the strong franc
depressing Ciba's outcome rather more than had been expected and
restructuring costs at Roche leading to some earnings downgrades.

The recent fall in the French market has led brokers to reassess their
year-end targets for the CAC-40 index, writes John Pitt.
Hoare Govett, for example, has reduced its target to 1,950 - the index
closed at 1,842.09 on Friday - although the broker remains overweight in
France in relation to the rest of continental Europe.
While nearly all company results are now in, a few remain, such as Accor,
the hotel and travel services group, which will publish disappointing
first-half results tomorrow. The company prepared investors for the worst
last week, but added that second-half figures were always better.
The French hotel and leisure industry has been experiencing a difficult
time, especially as the decline in consumer spending continues. Club Med and
EuroDisney have been lowering their prices with mixed results: Club Med has
seen occupancy rates climb after price cuts of up to 3 per cent, while the
theme park operator has still failed to increase visitor numbers in spite of
reducing admission charges.
The share prices have also gone in both directions - Club Med rising 20 per
cent since the start of the year and EuroDisney down 53 per cent over the
same period.

The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but James Capel argues that stubbornly high
inflation and rising capacity utilisation argue against further rate cuts.
On the corporate front, the utilities will be in focus, with RWE holding its
annual balance sheet press conference and Veba meeting analysts. UBS does
not expect major financial surprises but says there is likely to be
substantial information presented on the telecommunications activities and
both companies should continue their strong performances on the back of
these details.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Final quarter promises more gains - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market is beginning to resemble last week's ill-fated press
trip by the Eurotunnel express; all set up for a triumphant run, yet the
train refuses to leave the station.
Bond prices have picked up, opening the way for the FT-SE 100 Index to race
for those year-end 3,500 to 3,600 forecasts; but the Footsie 3,100 hurdle is
hurtling away in the wrong direction.
The new problem, for the other European markets as well as London, is the US
dollar. Opinions differ as to how significant dollar weakness is regarded by
the Federal Reserve in its policy decisions. But the impact on the UK blue
chips of concern over the US currency is clear enough.
About one-fifth of corporate earnings in the Footsie list can be designated
'dollar-influenced', according to Edmond Warner at Kleinwort Benson
Securities. The companies concerned range across the multinational
pharmaceuticals, through the drink, consumer and engineering sectors. Next
month brings trading results from BP, BAT Industries, BA, Unilever and GEC,
to name but a few. All big-name, index-moving stocks impacting across the
full range of the London market.
The currency alarm was sounded on Friday morning when the sterling/dollar
rate moved above Dollars 1.65. Indeed, the move in the cable rate from
Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.62, its highest level since sterling left the ERM,
had already sent many London analysts back to the computers for a fresh look
at earnings forecasts.
The outcome of their review is not entirely negative. Much depends on how
permanent the dollar trend proves to be. Strauss Turnbull points out that a
weaker dollar restrains imported inflationary pressure in the UK and that
there is some statistical evidence that total returns on dollar-earners
relative to the market are in fact inversely related to dollar trends.
Strauss identifies Grand Metropolitan as a company which can out-perform
against dollar weakness because it buys its currency forward and, more
importantly, sees servicing costs fall on its Pounds 4bn plus of
dollar-denominated debt. Hanson, as might be expected, arbitrages between
sterling deposits and dollar-denominated debt.
Guinness, on the other hand, shares with HSBC and Standard Chartered
additional sensitivity to the Hong Kong dollar which is linked to the US
currency; and Guinness does not hedge translation of profits.
The same mix occurs even in the pharmaceutical sector, clearly a target for
currency worry. Glaxo does not hedge its forex position, but SmithKline
Beecham buys forward.
For as long as the dollar remains weak and European investors doubt the
Fed's intentions of coming to its aid, the FT-SE 100 Index will be under
threat. But London market strategists will be quick to seize any
opportunities among shares able to buck the trend.

The Pounds 2.5bn auction will be the focus of interest in the gilts market
this week.
The market often weakens ahead of auctions. The new stock, which could
become next year's five-year benchmark, has already weakened in pre-issue
trading.
It is a quiet week for UK economic statistics, with the main event
tomorrow's Confederation of British Industry quarterly survey of industrial
trends.
Two key indicators will be closely watched: the first is whether
industrialists have succeeded in implementing their expectations of higher
prices, recorded in previous surveys; the second is whether capacity
utilisation has increased, a worry which was intensified by last week's
British Chambers of Commerce survey.
The CBI survey is one of the key indicators cited by Mr Eddie George, the
governor of the Bank of England and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, in their monthly monetary meetings.
Throughout 1994, the gilts market has proved unable to escape for long the
influence of international bond markets.
Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks that overseas
statistics, notably US third-quarter gross domestic product growth and the
German consumer price index, will have the most significant effect on the UK
market this week.

FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Political risk migrates across the Rhine
 -Government issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following Germany's elections last week, political risk has migrated across
the Rhine to France, where it is spooking bond and currency markets as the
presidential elections loom.
But while the risk premium of French over German government bonds is likely
to increase further, that trend is likely to be reversed after the May
elections, leading to a period of out-performance by the French bond market.
The yield spread of 10-year French government bonds - Obligations
Assimilables du Tresor - over Germany's bunds widened to 74 basis points on
Friday from 59 a week before and eight basis points at the start of the
year.
'Although we still have political uncertainty in Germany, it is much reduced
now that we know (Chancellor Helmut) Kohl has the majority,' says Mr Troy
Bowler, bond strategist at PaineWebber.
In relative terms, France has become a worse bet, he says: not only does it
face the uncertainty of elections, but it has been shaken by scandals
surrounding government ministers, and by squabbling within Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur's right-wing RPR over the presidential candidacy.
No candidates have formally declared themselves, but informal campaigning
has begun - especially in the right-wing camp, where Mr Balladur and Mr
Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, are battling for the candidacy. Meanwhile,
it is widely assumed that Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission President
until year-end, will run for the Socialist Party.
The first round of voting will take place on April 23 1995, with the final
polling scheduled for May 7.
If Mr Balladur runs and wins, the markets would respond well, with the
current policy framework confirmed, says Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss
Bank Corporation.
Similarly, a Delors victory would entail few risks, given his commitment to
the 'Franc Fort' policy, fast-track EMU and adherence to the Maastricht
convergence criteria.
A Chirac win could cause greater concern, given the aggressive demands he
has made for changes in policies. However, 'in reality he has said little
which would change the French approach to EMU,' says Mr Hall. Moreover,
recent opinion polls leave Mr Chirac looking like an unlikely candidate for
the right.
Another risk factor would be early elections if President Francois
Mitterrand's health continued to worsen, which would mean elections must be
held within 35 days - possibly too soon for Mr Balladur to regain his
political footing.
Politics are not the only factor weighing on OATs: the weak US dollar has
exerted heavy pressure on the franc against the D-Mark, further depressing
the bond market.
Moreover, OATs tend to under-perform bunds in a bear market and out-perform
them on the way up - and bunds have weakened lately.
'The direction of bunds is important for the OAT-bund spread - if they
continue to sell off, that could push the spread out further,' says Mr
Bowler, who says the gap may widen to 100 basis points.
According to Mr Steven Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais,
politics, liquidity considerations and the volatility profile of the German
market favour bunds over OATs. Chart-technically, too, OATs may be
vulnerable to further yield spread widening if the spread breaks out of its
long-term downtrend, he warns. On the other hand, France's inflation
fundamentals, its supply situation and budgetary outlook tend to favour
OATs, and will support them eventually, he says.
According to Mr Dominique Barbet of Banque Paribas, France's budgetary
outlook will improve, regardless of who wins the elections.
'You don't see politicians saying they'll raise taxes or cut spending, but
French market participants are saying they will have to do both,' he says.
He expects the yield gap to widen towards 80 basis points but to start
shrinking once the presidential candidates become known in early January.
In the run-up to the elections, the market is likely to be very volatile but
price action is likely to reflect electoral uncertainty rather than serious
threats to French policy.
Thus, with the spread set to narrow after the elections, investors should
use periods of weakness to position themselves for that contraction, says
SBC's Mr Hall.
'Once the election uncertainty is removed we will probably see the OAT-bund
spread rallying well,' he predicts, setting a medium-term target of 30 basis
points.

With German interest rates on hold - Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting
is expected to make no changes - bond dealers are trying to extract glimmers
of comfort from monetary and economic indicators.
They did not find many in Friday's M3 figures. Although they showed a
continued slowdown, traders said they were higher than expected.
September's annualised growth rate was 7.7 per cent, compared with a 1994
target range of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. However, the rise on a
six-month annualised basis was a far more encouraging 2.9 per cent.
If October's west German inflation rate, which is likely to be released this
week, eases to 2.9 per cent, bond prices could improve.
A further slowdown in M3 expansion would help further, since it would
stimulate the hopes of those expecting the Bundesbank to cut rates by early
1995 before tightening again. However, the Bundesbank is in no hurry to move
either way, especially with economic recovery accelerating.
The German economy needs no help from the Bundesbank in the short term.
However, the bank is concerned about the budget deficit and structural
rigidities in the economy. These are what will increasingly underlie its
actions, even if inflation and wage trends do moderate.

FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Big US players take a global view -
International issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's announcement by the US Federal National Mortgage Association, or
Fannie Mae, of its intention to borrow Dollars 20bn in international capital
markets has introduced a significant new player on to the foreign borrowing
scene.
Fannie Mae, one of the world's biggest issuers of long-term debt, has
traditionally relied on US domestic capital markets for its extensive
funding needs - it has an annual requirement of around Dollars 46bn.
However, as it seeks to fund expansion of its Dollars 214bn portfolio of
mortgages, it is now turning to the global market for more diverse and
cheaper sources of funding.
If other major US players follow, which is likely - the US Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loans Bank, are
also taking a serious look at the international markets  - they will dwarf
even the large European sovereign borrowers, who have dominated foreign
borrowing over the last few years.
Fannie Mae made its debut in the international bond markets in June with a
Dollars 1.5bn offering of 10-year global debentures, at a price
significantly less than would have been the case in the US market, according
to Ms Linda Knight, Fannie Mae senior vice-president and treasurer.
Freddie Mac launched its own Dollars 1.5bn global issue in July and the
Federal Home Loan Bank was active in the market last week with two dollar
deals, a Dollars 400m fixed-rate offer and a Dollars 200m floating-rate
issue.
However, Fannie Mae's announcement comes at a time of substantial change in
the international capital markets. Many of the large sovereign borrowers are
reducing their foreign borrowing activity, as they attempt to claw back
their budget deficits and as greater economic growth boosts their tax
revenues. At the same time, the upturn in the economic cycle is fuelling the
appetite of many corporate and financial borrowers for more foreign
borrowing.
As one eurobond syndicate manager in London said: 'Apart from the obvious
exceptions like Sweden, sovereign borrowing is likely to become a thing of
the past as the pressures to fund decline. The obvious question then is: are
the corporate borrowers going to take over?'
In the US, that is already happening to a certain extent. Ford Motor Credit,
the financing arm of Ford, came to the market last week with Dollars 250m
offering of five-year floating-rate notes.
GECC, the financing arm of General Electric, regularly taps the many
different currency sectors of the international capital markets - it has
borrowed Dollars 4.6bn already this year, after borrowing Dollars 4.7bn last
year, according to figures from Euromoney Bondware.
In the UK, where companies tend to rely more on equity than debt for
capital, the rise in bond issues has been less marked.
However, there are exceptions - the Abbey National, one of the UK's largest
mortgage lenders, has borrowed around Dollars 9bn in the international
public markets this year.
Last week it launched a Dollars 500m offering of Yankee bonds targeted
directly at the US market and it intends to follow that up with a global
offering of bonds of around Dollars 1.5bn, which should be launched early
next year.
The bank also has about Dollars 9bn of medium-term notes outstanding in
Europe and has the potential to issue Dollars 3bn of MTNs in the US.
Italy, which borrowed around Dollars 12.8bn in 1993, according to Euromoney
Bondware, has reduced that to about Dollars 8bn so far this year. This
involved a yen issue in January and a multi-tranche offering later in the
year made-up of D-Mark, US dollar and yen tranches. Italy needs to borrow
about Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn this year on the international markets,
according to the Italian Treasury.
The supranational institutions such as the European Investment Bank and the
World Bank look set to remain major borrowers.
The European Investment Bank, which raised about Ecu14.2bn over the whole of
last year, has raised around Ecu11.5bn so far this year. Of this, around 75
per cent has been in EU currencies, mostly Italian lire and the remainder
split evenly between D-Marks, French francs and sterling.
About 80 per cent of the issues have been in fixed-rate bonds. Treasury
officials expect that further issuance this year could be in Italian lire
and Spanish pesetas.
The World Bank, which last week was active in the Italian lira and
Luxembourg franc sectors, and which launched both a global D-Mark and a
global offering earlier this autumn, has an approximate funding target of
Dollars 10bn for its current fiscal year.
The Republic of Sweden, which borrowed Dollars 11.8bn in 1993, has already
borrowed Dollars 12.6bn this year and given the size of its budget deficit,
looks set to maintain a sizeable presence in the capital markets.
The Republic of Finland has also been a major borrower this year, tapping
various markets, including the US dollar, Japanese yen and floating-rate
D-Mark sectors, raising a total of around Dollars 6.6bn so far in 1994.

The US bond market is settling back into the gloomy conviction that the
Federal Reserve is going to raise rates, possibly very shortly. Last week's
data on the domestic economy were too strong for comfort and in the
background is a factor which could prove just as decisive, the ominous slide
of the dollar.
Last week, the dollar dipped below DM1.50 for the first time this year,
having started at DM1.74 in January. Against the yen it is now decisively
below the Y100 mark, sliding last week as low as Y97. While the Fed
disclaims any specific exchange rate targets, it must be getting close to
deciding that enough is enough.
That apart, the big figure this week is US third-quarter GDP on Friday. A
fall is expected from 4.1 per cent annualised growth in the second quarter
to around 2.8 per cent. This would still represent growth of over 4 per cent
year-on-year.
A danger signal could be the strength of consumer spending, given the level
of retail sales and the rise in employment. There should be further guidance
on this on Tuesday, with the figures on consumer confidence.
Other figures due are the employers' cost index on Tuesday, durable goods
orders on Wednesday and money supply data on Thursday. The general picture,
the market fears, could be of economic strength asking to be curbed.

While the strength in the yen is expected to support the bond market, prices
are likely to fluctuate in a narrow range this week due to continued
cautiousness over prospects for a sustained economic recovery.
Investors will be focused on the Bank of Japan branch managers' meeting this
week, which is likely to confirm a pick-up in northern and western Japan
where the effects of the collapse of the asset 'bubble' have been mild.
While the bank is expected to keep short-term rates low to curb a further
rise in the yen, confirmation that the economy is experiencing steady
recovery may add upward pressure on interest rates.
Industrial production figures for September to be released at the end of the
week are also likely to be negative for the bond markets. Although output is
likely to have declined by about 1 per cent from August, it is expected to
have risen by more than 2 per cent from September 1993.
'We expect production gains on a year-on-year basis to accelerate in coming
months,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Inventory adjustment has
largely been concluded as shown by the drop in the ratio of inventories to
shipments to its lowest level since September 1991, and growing domestic
demand together with export increases will support industrial output growth
this year and next, it says.

STRATEGY
In the final quarter of 1994 James Capel's emerging markets team is
maintaining a preference for Latin America, recommending an overweight
position against Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Capel said that it was recommending a broadly neutral stance on Asia,
although it picked out South Korea and Indonesia as worthy of an overweight
position.
Within Latin America, Colombia and Chile have been moved up in Capel's list
to overweight, on the basis that both markets provide 'an attractive
combination of improving economic growth and stable politics.'
Kleiman International Consultants find that over the year to date, of the 65
markets tracked two have reached triple digit gains in local currency terms
 -Egypt by 115 per cent on privatisation and liberalisation progress and
currency rebound, while Ghana rose 120 per cent on strong foreign interest.
TURKEY
Citibank has announced the first warrant on a basket of Turkish equities.
The 'Citi-Bosphorous' basket is believed to be the first ever derivative
product on a diversified Turkish equity portfolio offered to both local and
international investors.
Citibank says that the basket includes 10 important Turkish stocks,
representing about a third of Istanbul's composite index in terms of market
capitalisation and trading volume. Listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange,
the warrant has a one-year maturity.
INVESTMENT TRUST
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets Investment Trust has said that it has
had firm intentions from more than 30 institutions for its new issue of C
shares. A cap for the issue has been set at Pounds 115m, against an initial
target of Pounds 70m. A further 30m shares will be available to the public
with the offer for subscriptions closing on November 14 and dealings to
begin on November 18.
INDIAN GDRS
The London Stock Exchange has listed its first Global Depository Receipts in
India-based East India Hotels, writes Norma Cohen. The company, listed on
the Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi stock exchanges, is a leading owner and
operator of four- and five-star hotels. Merrill Lynch is sponsor to the
GDRs.
GDRs for two other Indian companies, Shiram Industrial Enterprises, a
manufacturer of food oils and JK Corporation, the country's largest copier
and airmail paper manufacturer, will begin trading in London on October 31.
RUSSIA
Russiamoney, a screen-based English language information service
specialising in the analysis of Russia's emerging capital markets, has been
launched on the Bloomberg financial markets service. Russiamoney, a joint
venture between Emerging Money and the Moscow-based Investment &amp; Analysis
Centre, will initially provide weekly comment and analysis of specific
investment themes. From January 1995 there will be daily reports and comment
on the Russian currency, bond and equity markets.
JAPAN
The Tokyo stock exchange is to relax listing requirements for foreign
companies, maybe before the year-end, in an effort to persuade Asian
companies to trade.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Thai bond market set for lift-off - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Thai bond market may be poised to become one of Asia's fastest growing
debt markets - perhaps even emulating the extraordinary rise of the Bangkok
stock market over the past decade.
By default Baht-denominated bonds could, alongside the Hong Kong market,
become one of the most attractive debt markets for foreign investors in east
Asia, according to a senior World Bank official.
The historically moribund secondary market for Thai bonds could receive a
lift when trading starts on the over-the-counter market on November 1.
'There is a huge potential - the Thai stock market is equivalent to 105 per
cent of the GNP; the bond market measures less than 5 per cent of GNP,' said
Mr Ishmail Dalla, head of a World Bank mission to advise the Thai government
on the privatisation of state enterprises.
'We see a small market that is starting to explode,' said Mr Vuthiphong
Priebjrivat, the managing director of Thailand Rating and Information
Services, the newly established credit rating agency.
It could be several years before rival emerging debt markets in Asia
overcome their regulatory teething problems or a hostility to foreign
investment.
Korea, for instance, has a large debt market but it remains largely fenced
off to overseas investors, partly for fear that capital inflows will drive
up the value of the won.
The Malaysian bond market motored from nothing to Dollars 6bn last year
after the government insisted that every debt issuer had to obtain a rating.
A requirement that all debt issues obtain a credit rating makes it much
easier for portfolio managers to invest in Malaysia's fixed income market.
Yet the Kuala Lumpur authorities' penchant for interfering was displayed
last year when Bank Negara deliberately squeezed out many foreign capital
deposits for fear that they would disrupt the monetary regime and the
exchange rate.
Thailand is generally more relaxed about foreign capital inflows and has a
currency that has tracked the dollar without significant interruption for
many years.
The finance minister, Mr Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, said: 'We are the poorer for
not having an active bond market - we want to see one get going.'
The Baht bond market hardly twitched in the dozen years to 1992, when rapid
economic growth was driving the stock market's capitalisation up nearly
60-fold.
Thai administrations have traditionally been cautious about going into debt;
for the past six years governments have run a budget surplus and reduced the
volume of government bonds at issue.
Corporations - public or private - were simply not allowed to issue their
own paper until late 1992: foreign direct investment, the lively stock
market and banks provided adequate capital sources.
The general complacency over a debt market has been shattered by two
developments: the need to revamp the countries' creaking infrastructure and
the corporate sector's enthusiastic discovery of disintermediation - tapping
by borrowers of savers without the help of the banks.
The World Bank calculates that the 15 public utilities that it has targeted
for privatisation will need to raise external funding of Dollars 52.5bn
between now and the end of the century.
Mr Dalla, a bank official, said: 'The Thai government is loath to borrow
money directly and the Thai banking sector is not geared up for long-term
lending. Yet equity investors demand too high a yield - the bond market is
the only place to go.'
As a rule-of-thumb Mr Dalla reckoned that three quarters of infrastructure
funding should come from the debt markets and a quarter from the stock
market.
Thailand's debt market is well developed but has concentrated on short-term
maturities, with finance companies issuing promissory notes to fund their
lending and cor-porations issuing short-term paper known as bills of
exchange.
Corporations have discovered that, following the legal changes, they can
often obtain funds more cheaply and with fewer collateral requirements by
issuing bonds than going to their traditional bank lenders.
Mr Vuthiphong reckons that the market for corporate bonds could climb from
Bt20bn at the end of 1993 to nearly Bt100bn this year and perhaps Bt250bn by
1995. Assuming that state enterprises add another Bt100bn to the Bt150bn of
bonds already at issue then he said that the total bond market could surpass
Bt500bn (Dollars 20bn) by the end of 1995. The capitalisation of the stock
market is currently about Bt3.5 trillion or Dollars 141bn.
These figures do not include the Bt40bn raised by corporations on the
Euroconvertible debenture last year. By tapping the Euromarkets in this way,
the corporations learnt about debt markets, although rising interest rates
and weaker Bangkok share prices have combined to close off this avenue for
funds for the moment.
Next week's first tentative steps in scripless closed circuit
over-the-counter (semi-regulated) trading should involve up to 15 active
traders, although more than 60 organisations have registered an interest
(perhaps because they believe this is a one-time only application).
Some sceptics have still to be convinced that Asian investors, hooked on the
excitement of a stock market as volatile as Bangkok's, will be attracted to
the bond market. Yet the government is pushing for the development of the
central provident fund, the mutual fund and insurance industries, and other
obvious customers.
Tipsuda Thavaramara, bond specialist at the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said: 'We want to see a lively bond market if possible. We'll
have several teething problems but nothing that's going to kill the market.'
Mr Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala, the director at the Bank of Thailand in
charge of bond market development, said that in the absence of an adequate
government bond yield curve to act as a benchmark, investors would probably
have to be content to trade in blue chip corporations and state enterprises.
Mr Thirachai said: 'I won't worry if things aren't desperately exciting
straight away. The demand is there - it's inevitable.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange traders will face a familiar challenge at the start of the
week: whither the dollar?
The dollar touched a post-war low of Y96.55 against the yen last Friday, and
a two-year low of DM1.4880 against the D-Mark. Many analysts predict it will
sink lower, but traders are nervous of selling the currency aggressively for
fear of being caught short by central bank intervention.
Apart from the Bank of Japan, there has been no sign of central bank
support, but the likelihood of this will increase should the dollar sink
towards the DM1.45 level.
The main concern of the market is that the Fed has not moved quickly enough
to combat rising inflationary pressures in the US. It is very difficult to
forecast a dollar recovery until this perception is effectively countered
and US asset markets look more attractive.
The key figure for the market to focus on will be the release on Friday of
the third quarter GDP growth rate. Economists will be looking to see to what
extent tighter monetary policy this year has slowed growth. Most estimates
see GDP falling towards 3 per cent, from 4.1 per cent. The employment cost
index, out on Tuesday, will also be closely watched for any signs of wage
inflation.
Outside of the US, the main influence on the dollar will be the Bundesbank
council, which meets on Thursday. Opinion is divided as to whether the next
move in German rates is up or down. Should they cut, while US rates continue
to rise, this might lend support to the dollar.
The US discount rate is currently 4 per cent, while the equivalent rate in
Germany is 4.5 per cent. Some analysts believe a cross-over in US and German
short-term interest rates could trigger a turnround in the dollar.
Investors will also be keeping an eye on sterling, whose fortunes have
revived recently. The pound has rallied from Dollars 1.5525 to a high so far
of Dollars 1.6336, a gain of over 5 per cent in fewer than seven weeks.
Although the upward move was sparked largely by dollar weakness, and
political risk attaching to the D-Mark ahead of the recent elections, it is
supported by economic fundamentals. Inflation is at a 27-year low, growth is
robust, and the balance of payments is in much better health than most
analysts had predicted.
Sterling also looks good from a chart perspective. Mr Chris Dunne, analyst
at Forexia, says sterling still looks very strong. He predicts that it will
reach Dollars 1.65 and DM2.46 over the next few weeks.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: The bill comes in for the free lunch - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you believe the proponents of modern portfolio theory, international
diversification offers the nearest thing in the investment world to a free
lunch.
For those who do not have an already fully diversified fund, raising the
proportion of overseas assets is supposed either to lower risk at no
sacrifice of return; or to raise expected returns for a given degree of
risk.
That is, in the American argot, a win-win situation. Yet for professional
fund managers who have bought this theoretical package the phrase seems an
odd description for events in 1994. The essence of the diversification
argument lies in the notion that price movements in foreign markets are not
closely correlated to price movements at home.
Yet in practice world bond markets have been relatively closely correlated
for many years. And the bond market fall-out earlier this year was
synchronised to an extraordinary degree.
By now a more divergent pattern of behaviour has emerged. But if part of the
point of buying foreign bonds was to escape a dramatic market shock at home,
then the strategy was not much use in the first half of 1994.
As for equity markets, they are already very integrated in the developed
world, if not quite to the same extent as bonds, and show fairly high
correlation coefficients despite cyclical divergence in the underlying
economies.
It has always seemed plausible that emerging markets offer the best form of
diversification. Their economies are furthest out of synchronisation with
those in the OECD area. The first of the attached charts, showing the
movement of Latin American and Asian equity market indices against a world
index, appears to support that view.
If there was any correlation with the OECD economies in the first half of
the year it was with bonds rather than equities, no doubt reflecting the use
of borrowed money. Since then emerging markets have recovered to earlier
levels. A more hard nosed interpretation might be that it simply
demonstrates a fad. US fund managers caught the diversification bug last
year, just as investors generally were waking up to the potential for high
returns in Asia and Latin America. So the diversification argument became
self-fulfilling after a long period in which emerging markets had seen their
correlations with equity markets in the developed world increase.
Another striking feature of the chart is how closely correlated Asia and
Latin America seem to be, despite widely divergent economic circumstances.
While diversification is available generally in emerging markets, there is
not much benefit to be had by spreading the investment between different
regions.
The overall message is that it is increasingly difficult to obtain
worthwhile diversification. Nor is the pay-off very obvious. Over the 10
years to end-1993 UK domestic equities showed an average return of 18.8 per
cent compared with only 15.2 per cent on international equities in sterling
terms. And of the 18 countries covered in UBS's Global Pension Fund
Indicators, 10 showed better domestic equity returns than international
equity returns in local currency terms.
British fund managers with a high overseas content could argue that the
lower return was amply justified by the reduction in risk provided by
diversification, and that international equities may well do better in
future years. The latter point is convincing if you believe that the UK
stock market's extraordinary capacity to grow faster than UK output and
incomes is unsustainable. But in the light of the growing integration of
markets, was the risk reduction really so great?
The short answer is that it must still be worth having, in order to insure
against country-specific shocks. The proportion of Hong Kong pension fund
assets in overseas equities and bonds is an astonishingly high 60 per cent.
Yet it is hard to argue with that strategy given the political cloud that
hangs over this highly dynamic economy.
What, then, of the merits of property as a vehicle for diversification? The
second chart confirms that property shares are more closely correlated to
the equity market than to property itself. Direct property, meantime, has
offered useful diversification against the bond market shake-out.
On the international front property is clearly no worse than equities or
bonds in providing cross-border insurance. And property markets have the
huge advantage of being much less integrated. Forms of tenure, lease terms
and patterns of ownership vary enormously from country to country.
It follows that property should be able to provide far more diversification
benefit than securities. But even here there are caveats. AMF Pension, the
Swedish insurer and pensions group, with help from agents Jones Lang
Wootton, recently looked at more than a decade of returns on prime offices
in the main European property markets. According to Tor Perry Marthin,
senior vice president and chief investment officer, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and
Brussels moved in lockstep, while Paris was only marginally less closely
correlated. So three out of the four continental European centres could
offer no additional worthwhile diversification benefits. Only London was out
on its own.
Note, too, that theoretical discussion about diversification tends to ignore
the real world problem of liquidity, which is important in property -
although not as important for immature pension funds as for other investors.
It is possible that this year's events in the markets will reduce the appeal
of diversification for the more practically minded fund managers. And if US
institutions conclude that they have much less need for insurance against
country-specific shocks in their vast continental economy, the pattern of
global capital flows could look very different next year.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: Mastering the rat race - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main aims of the Social Justice Commission, whose final report is
out today, was to explain why certain groups in the UK are not working, and
suggest ways to help them to get jobs. But another puzzle has tended to
receive less attention: why are others, especially in non-manual jobs,
working harder?
Some would say that non-work and hard work have a single explanation: the
structure of the tax and benefit system. Just as high marginal tax rates
discourage the 'poverty trapped' from taking work, lower rates for those
already working a full 35-hour week might have encouraged many employed
people to work harder.
Yet international evidence suggests that neither different tax rates, nor
different levels of earnings, can fully explain why some people work longer
hours. Longer hours may well be a response to distorted incentives,
something policy-makers cannot easily change.
In a seminar last week at the London School of Economics, Professor Richard
Freeman, a Harvard economist, provided an interesting test-case for any
explanation of differing work habits. He noted that a sizeable gap has
emerged between hours worked in the US and Germany.
In 1970, US employees worked, on average, somewhat fewer hours over the
course of a year than their German counterparts. By 1993, however, Americans
were working some 200 hours more than Germans, a difference of 13 per cent.
At first sight, a tax-based explanation of the difference in work effort
seems highly plausible. On average, German workers face about a third higher
average and marginal tax rates than their counterparts in the US. Germans
can also rely on more 'social income' (such as welfare payments), which
might lead them to choose more leisure. In the US, income taxes for medium
and high earners fell in the 1980s.
Differing real wage trends since 1970 provide another explanation for longer
US hours. German real wages have continued to rise since the 1970s, in
contrast to the US where they have been stagnant or falling. Standard
economic theory would predict that Germans would choose more leisure as
their real incomes rose, while Americans might be expected to work harder to
hold on to the same standard of living.
There are difficulties, however, with both the tax-benefit and the real wage
interpretation of the US-German 'work-gap'. For one thing, workers in
Germany also work fewer hours than those in neighbouring countries, where
taxes and benefits are just as high.
Second, although some of the rise in hours worked among low-paid US workers
is probably a response to falling wages, work effort has risen most among
professional, educated workers, whose relative earnings have actually risen
over the period.
So why do Americans work so much more? Drawing on data from a wide range of
countries, Prof Freeman has concluded that is it not the level of individual
pre- or post-tax wages per se, but the overall distribution of earnings that
explains cross-country differences in work-effort.
In the US, high and rising earnings inequality means that 'the rewards to
greater effort are large and the penalties to slack are substantial'. The
opposite is true in Germany, where the social safety net is higher and the
overall distribution of pay has remained fairly equal.
Clearly, for many in the US, a great deal may hinge on whether they can
persuade their bosses that they are hard workers. But the people who put in
the longest hours are not necessarily the most productive. In many jobs, one
might expect the reverse to hold. Someone who spends 12 hours on a task
which takes others only 10 may get points for effort, but few for
productivity.
At other times, the quantity of work done is a better indication of its
quality, but the correlation is rarely one-to-one. Employers would usually
do better assessing the individual's output more directly. Unfortunately,
this is not always possible. In many labour-intensive professions, a
willingness to 'put in the hours' may be the only way for employers to
gauge, however imperfectly, whether someone is up to the job.
There is danger here, first spotted by George Akerlof, the economist, in the
mid-1970s. Employees who would prefer to work fewer hours are aware that
their boss may take this to denote poor quality. They may, therefore, try to
hide their true preferences, agreeing to work longer hours in return for a
given wage than they would otherwise choose. Knowing the incentive to
deceive, employers may, in turn, demand unnecessarily long hours to flush
out those who are only pretending to like working late.
The upshot is a 'rat race equilibrium' in which everyone ends up working
more than either they, or the jobs themselves, would otherwise demand.
Some occupations will suffer from this problem more than others. Recent
research in large US law firms, for example, has found significant evidence
of over-work consistent with the Akerlof model.*
It is plausible that the recent rise in hours worked, much of it unpaid,
among managerial workers in the UK partly reflects a similar problem.
Changing the tax system could allow more people to join the rat race: it
might not make it any less exhausting.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Markets: Brighter outlook for aluminium - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the US aluminium industry began organising its first international
conference and exposition last year its mood was close to suicidal.
Aluminium prices were at an all-time low in real terms and most companies
were piling up losses.
How quickly the mood has changed.
The industry will make its way to Alumitech '94 in Atlanta, not to
commiserate but to celebrate. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange
were above Dollars 1,700 a tonne on Friday, a level which allows every
smelter in the world to make a profit.
With their short-term difficulties apparently behind them, the 1,200
executives expected to attend - from Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Japan, Mexico, Russia and the UK, as well as the US - will hear some
heartening forecasts about aluminium's global growth prospects, particularly
in key markets such as the beverage can and the automotive industries.
One keynote speaker, Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals, the
world's third-largest aluminium group, already has predicted that the global
aluminium can market will grow by 65 per cent by the year 2000.
Another speaker, Mr Jacques Bougie, president of Alcan, the second-largest
aluminium producer, says confidently: 'By the year 2010 the world automotive
industry could be consuming as much as three times the aluminium as it does
today. The additional shipments to this market alone could require the
equivalent of the output of 30 to 40 additional world scale aluminium
smelters.'
Alumitech '94 lasts from Wednesday to Saturday.
Natural resources will be considered at a conference, Doing Business in
Uzbekistan, which will be held in London on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.
Subjects for debate will include: oil and gas; mining; tobacco; cotton and,
inevitably, prospects for foreign investment in this part of the former
Soviet Union.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Alcatel may keep CEAC stake

Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial group, may remain a minority
shareholder in CEAC, the French battery manufacturer, in spite of last
week's announcement that Fiat of Italy intends to sell its majority stake in
the company to Exide Corporation, the US batteries group.
The Italian automotive and industrial group, which owns 62 per cent of CEAC,
has decided to sell to Exide rather than step up competition against the US
group, which is increasing its presence in Europe.
But Alcatel, which owns almost all the remaining CEAC shares, said on Friday
that it had not yet decided whether to sell its stake to the US company.
Alcatel also controls extensive industrial battery operations worldwide
through its Saft subsidiary.
CEAC has a turnover of L1,191bn (Dollars 778m), mainly in the automotive
battery business, and has been valued at Dollars 535m, Fiat said.
Fiat, which took control of CEAC in 1991, said the sale should be finalised
within the next few months, after approval by the relevant authorities.
Earlier this year, Exide bought Big Batteries, the UK's largest private
battery manufacturer, and launched a bid for control of Tudor, the Spanish
battery maker.
Fiat has also decided to buy a 17 per cent stake in the Canadian company
Meridian Technologies, which is the world leader in the manufacture of
pressed magnesium components.
The Italian company's metal products subsidiary, Teksid, will acquire the
stake and will be able to nominate two directors to the eight-strong board
of the Canadian company, Fiat said.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hochtief builds case for
Holzmann / A look at prospects for a ground-breaking merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The more Mr Lothar Mayer talks, the more he sounds like a man negotiating
with a guillotine operator over the terms and conditions for a haircut.
Mr Mayer, chairman of Philipp Holzmann, Germany's biggest construction
concern, is proposing a little bit off the sides. But Mr Hans-Peter Keitel,
chief of second-ranked Hochtief, seems to want his head.
This lop-sided discussion started late last month, when Hochtief said it
intended to increase its stake in Holzmann to about 30 per cent with the
purchase of a 10 per cent holding owned by BfG Bank.
While Mr Keitel claims he does not want a formal merger - saying the groups
should remain as competitors, at least in the domestic market - he makes no
bones about wanting to win control.
For a start, he needs cartel office approval for his plan to take Hochtief's
stake above 25 per cent. Then, he says, he wants to raise his holding to
around 40 per cent. At this level he could dominate Holzmann's annual
meetings, where it is rare for more than 80 per cent of the shares to be
represented.
The Hochtief initiative appears to have been prompted by Mr Mayer himself,
who almost a year ago said Deutsche Bank was planning to reduce and
eventually dispose of its 25.9 per cent stake in Holzmann.
Although Deutsche made no comments at the time, a more recent leak that it
planned to reduce its holding to 10 per cent effectively put Holzmann into
play and forced Hochtief's hand. In Mr Keitel's words, his minority stake
was 'taken out of the refrigerator' where it had been stored since 1981.
Mr Keitel also revealed last week that his board had been carrying on
hitherto fruitless negotiations with Holzmann executives for about a year.
Now, however, confronted with Hochtief's ambitions, Mr Mayer seems eager to
accept that the two groups can fruitfully 'co-operate' in their overseas
operations, where there are no significant overlaps.
It is even possible that they might fuse their operations in individual
countries or regions, and pass control of the new entities to whichever of
the partners has more experience in the particular area, he says.
In the US, for example, Holzmann's Jones Group subsidiary would be the ideal
leader for such a collaboration. However, there was absolutely no sense in
merging German operations. This was a case in which two plus two made
considerably less than four, said Mr Mayer.
He was hawking a similar line at a meeting with analysts last week. He could
well imagine co-operation abroad, 'but not at the price of our independence
at home', he said.
Mr Mayer also protests that Hochtief's approaches should be rejected on
anti-trust grounds.
Although the two companies account for only about 3 per cent of the German
market - there are about 75,000 building companies in the whole country - Mr
Mayer has taken considerable pains to point out that construction expertise
within certain specialist sectors is already heavily concentrated in a few
hands.
These include power stations, underground railways and high-rise office
buildings. He claims that the cartel office's timetable (it has given itself
a full four months to investigate the deal) indicates that it intends to
undertake a thorough probe of these niches.
Speaking to journalists last week, Mr Mayer also pointed out that Holzmann
had been prevented on anti-trust grounds from taking a 25 per cent stake in
the Dywidag group.
However, that was 10 years ago, before the awakening to the realities of
global competition.
Analysts suggest the German anti-trust authorities are nowadays more likely
to be interested in possible dangers stemming from the lack of concentration
in the German construction business.
As the number of companies involved suggests, the industry is heavily
influenced by the introspective Mittelstand mentality. The 30 biggest
companies together account for less than 15 per cent of the entire market.
Although big in German terms, the antagonists in the current affair are no
giants in the international arena.
Holzmann's DM12.5bn (Dollars 8bn) annual turnover is modest compared with
the DM18bn sales at French group Bouygues, for example. Turnover at Hochtief
is about DM8bn.
Their non-domestic business interests - accounting for a third of sales at
Holzmann and a quarter at Hochtief - are also modest by international
standards.
Analysts, who gave an almost unanimous welcome to the announcement of
Hochtief's plans, say that more muscle together with more concentration of
skills and financing power are needed if the leaders of the German building
industry are to make their way in the world outside their stagnating
domestic market.
They see traditionalist Holzmann, with its shrinking foreign business, and
aggressive Hochtief, with an impressive reputation in airport construction
and a markedly better profits record, as the perfect test case of the
industry's will and ability to consolidate and find a new way in the world.
As one observer said, the idea that the Berlin cartel office should prevent
merger or closer collaboration between the two on the grounds of excessive
concentration in some domestic niche sector 'would take German provincialism
to absurd extremes'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting lifts Kao in first
half
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kao, Japan's leading maker of household products, has reported a rise in
profits for the first half of the year, helped by cost-cutting and the
success of new products.
Demand for a new cosmetics line, gift soaps and a new floor cleaning fluid,
helped sales rise by 2.1 per cent to Y322.5bn (Dollars 3.3bn) in the six
months to September. Recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax,
rose more steeply, by 12 per cent to Y25.76bn.
Sales of laundry and cleansing products, Kao's largest sector, worth nearly
40 per cent of turnover, rose to Y127.6bn from Y123.9bn, while sales of
personal care products, 35.5 per cent of the total, rose slightly to
Y114.5bn. Results for some skin care products, a market where price cutting
is rife, fell by comparison with last year.
Overall operating profits rose 8 per cent to Y27bn in the interim period.
Operating margins were a record 8.4 per cent of turnover.
Kao has been one of the few Japanese companies to keep profits and margins
rising through the recession. This is partly a result of cost reductions and
the rapidity of new product releases.
First-half earnings per share rose 4.1 per cent to Y21.11.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Singapore Airlines ahead midway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Singapore Airlines (SIA), the world's most profitable airline last year, has
confirmed the financial recovery in the airline industry by reporting a 20
per cent rise in group operating profits to SDollars 478m (USDollars 322m)
for the half year to September.
The airline itself reported an even higher jump in first-half operating
profits of 57.7 per cent to SDollars 385m, reflecting the economic recovery
in leading industrialised countries and lower fuel costs.
However, the operating profits of the airline's subsidiaries fell by nearly
40 per cent to SDollars 93m, largely as a result of losses at its SilkAir
regional airline subsidiary, airport duty-free activities, and its
investment subsidiary being hit by the international downturn in both equity
and bond markets.
SIA group net profits rose 17.7 per cent in the first half to SDollars 461m,
while the airline's net earnings improved 31.7 per cent to SDollars 438m.
Half-year group revenues rose 7 per cent to SDollars 3.248bn while airline
turnover increased by 7.8 per cent to SDollars 2.937bn.
Although the airline carried 10.4 per cent more traffic in the first half,
the overall yield fell 2.5 per cent entirely due to the strength of the
Singapore dollar.
Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said revenue yields would
continue to remain under pressure because of increased competition in both
the intercontinental and Asian markets.
Although the worst was now over and some light was finally appearing at the
end of the tunnel, Dr Cheong warned it would not be 'entirely smooth sailing
from here on'.
Asian carriers have also been losing their distinct cost advantage over
airlines from more developed parts of the world because salaries, rents and
other lower costs in Asia were either catching up or had already overtaken
the levels in Europe or North America, Dr Cheong said.
SIA's expenditure rose 2.8 per cent in the first half to SDollars 2.552bn
due to higher costs of aircraft maintenance, overhaul, handling, landing and
parking, depreciation and staff, although these costs were to some extent
offset by lower fuel costs.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Downturn in third quarter at
Mobil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lower US natural gas prices and weaker refining margins in eastern Asia were
behind a 25 per cent fall in net income at Mobil in the third quarter, to
Dollars 503m.
Leaving aside one-off charges in both periods, however, the slide in
underlying profits after tax was only 14 per cent from a year before, when
Mobil had enjoyed a very strong quarter.
At Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with Dollars 1.63 a year earlier, the
company's earnings were squarely in line with market expectations.
Earnings in Mobil's exploration and production businesses fell by Dollars
56m to Dollars 309m. This reflected lower natural gas prices, offset in part
by higher crude oil prices, and higher exploration costs, both in the US and
overseas.
Profits from marketing and refining, meanwhile, slipped by Dollars 120m to
Dollars 234m. While margins were lower around the world, the fall reflected
Mobil's greater exposure to the refining business in the Asia/Pacific region
than most other US energy groups.
Partially offsetting these factors was a continuing rebound in Mobil's
petrochemicals business.
Earnings of Dollars 60m, up from Dollars 9m a year ago and Dollars 39m in
the second three months of 1994, benefited in particular from a better
polyethylene resin market, Mobil said.
Mr Lucio Noto, chairman, said he expected conditions in the petroleum
industry to remain volatile, and added that Mobil would continue with the
restructuring and cost-cutting policy which was intended to increase its
returns from its existing assets.
Mobil's return on equity in the 12 months to the end of September was 9.2
per cent, down from 12.3 per for the whole of 1993. Mr Noto, who took over
as chairman earlier this year, has set a target of raising Mobil's long-run
return on equity to about 12 per cent.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Price rises boost earnings at US
steel companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A series of price increases this year has boosted earnings at US steel
companies faster than expected, and is likely to be followed by further
price increases throughout 1995.
Nucor, the US's biggest mini-mill, and LTV, an integrated steel producer
which emerged from bankruptcy protection a year ago, each surpassed market
forecasts with third-quarter profits. The US's biggest steel producers, US
Steel and Bethlehem Steel, are among those due to report results this week.
The improved results come in the wake of three rounds of price rises pushed
through by most makers of flat-rolled steel products in the US so far this
year. More increases are expected early in 1995.
Next year's increases are reflected in the current 'spot' price for steel,
which has risen by 20 per cent this year, said Mr John Jacobson, a steel
analyst at Wefa, an economic consulting group. 'That will be translated into
the bottom line next year' as steel makers renegotiate contracts with their
biggest customers, he said.
In the three months to the end of September, Nucor's sales rose 34 per cent
from a year before, to Dollars 786m, as the company benefited from increased
capacity. LTV's sales rose 8 per cent, to Dollars 1.05bn, on a 4 per cent
increase in volume.
Steel imports into the US have jumped this year as domestic makers have hit
capacity constraints. In the first eight months, imports accounted for 24.2
per cent of total US sales, up from 17 per cent in the same period in 1993.
In an apparent attempt to ease the pressure for further price rises, General
Motors last week reached agreement to buy steel from Kawasaki Steel - the
first time it has bought Japanese steel for more than 20 years. However, the
small size of the deal made it 'largely symbolic,' with little influence on
prices, said Mr Jacobson.
Nucor, which makes steel from scrap in electric furnaces, reported earnings
per share in the third quarter of 74 cents, against market expectations of
around 62 cents. Its after-tax profits were 85 per cent up on a year before,
at Dollars 64.5m.
LTV, meanwhile, achieved earnings per share of 35 cents, some 3 cents higher
than expected. Its net income was Dollars 34.1m, compared with only Dollars
400,000 a year ago.

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hydro International to float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Where there's muck . . . Hydro International, a market leader in using
'vortex technology' for low-cost storm control and sewage treatment, is
going public next month through a Pounds 4m placing and full listing.
After 14 years of battling to win acceptance for its technology, the
Clevedon, Avon-based concern sees opportunities to accelerate its growth
through international expansion and development of new markets.
Hydro's products use a vortex - a kind of whirlpool effect which can be
harnessed to regulate fluid flows - for two main product ranges, flow
control valves for flood protection and storm control, and hydro dynamic
separators, for separating solids from liquids, especially in the treatment
of sewage and other waste water.
The company is hoping to benefit from recent environmental legislation
demanding sharp reductions in the level of pollutants that can be discharged
into seas, lakes, rivers and other water courses.
Mr Tim Lamb, managing director, said about 35 per cent of the Pounds 24bn
expected to be spent by the UK water and sewage industry up to 2005 is in
areas in which the company operates.
Hydro had sales last year of Pounds 4.1m and pre-tax profits of Pounds
156,000, expected to rise this year to about Pounds 5m and Pounds 400,000
respectively. Profits may dip next year because of research and development
spending, Mr Lamb said.
After the placing, which is being handled by Allied Provincial, about 30 per
cent of Hydro's shares will be in public hands.

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort China Fund placing to raise
Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Benson's China Investment &amp; Development Fund is seeking to raise
Dollars 30m (Pounds 19m) of new capital through a placing of new shares and
warrants.
Units of five shares and one warrant are priced at Dollars 55. The fund is
also making a scrip issue of one warrant for every five shares held on
October 14.
The Guernsey-incorporated, London-listed fund was launched in 1992 to invest
in joint ventures in China.
It now has investments in 10 joint ventures, accounting for 90 per cent of
its capital.
Results for the year to September 30 showed a net asset value of Dollars
10.10 per share, with losses of 11 cents per share.
In July the fund announced plans to double its size with a Dollars 60m fund
raising exercise. That has been scaled back, but the placing could be
expanded to a maximum of Dollars 60m if there is sufficient demand.
The placing closes on October 28.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Orion pushed into liquidation -
Dutch insurer can cover its commitments at London subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nationale-Nederlanden, the Dutch insurer, said yesterday it had sufficient
provisions to cover its commitments at its UK subsidiary, Orion, the
London-based insurance company which was pushed into provisional liquidation
on Friday.
Nationale-Nederlanden, which is part of the Internationale Nederlanden Groep
(ING), the Dutch financial services company, halted its cash support to
Orion and its subsidiary, Overseas Insurance, on Friday morning, prompting
the London-based companies to apply to the UK High Court for provisional
liquidation.
Orion, which pulled out of writing new business two years ago, is one of a
number of companies which have underwritten specialised commercial insurance
in the London market, often participating in contracts alongside syndicates
at Lloyd's of London.
Like Lloyd's, these companies have been hard hit by claims stemming from
pollution and asbestos-related awards in the US and by a string of poor
results in other sectors.
Mr Paul Evans and Mr Richard Boys-Stones of Price Waterhouse, the
provisional liquidators, said they had not yet examined the financial
position of either Orion or its Overseas subsidiary but noted that gross
liabilities 'might be of the order of Dollars 1.5bn'(Pounds 940m).
Nationale-Nederlanden declined to comment on the liquidators' gross figure
but said that Orion and Overseas Insurance could expect to recover funds
from their own reinsurance claims. The operations of the two companies were
deconsolidated from the accounts of ING in 1993.
The liquidation of Orion should have no effect on the profit and loss
account of Nationale-Nederlanden - or ING - as the company is convinced that
existing provisions will prove to be sufficient.
The company would not give a figure for the expected reinsurance recovery.
On Friday the statement from the provisional liquidators helped push ING's
shares down on a generally lower Amsterdam stock exchange.
Nationale-Nederlanden bought Orion in 1970. Claims on policies written by
Orion before August 1970 and by Overseas Insurance before March 1969 are not
the liability of the Dutch company.

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: JJB resumes plans for listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JJB (Sports), the UK's largest independent sports retailer, which postponed
a summer flotation due to 'adverse market conditions', is resuming its plans
to seek a listing.
However, going against the current trend for scaling down flotations, Mr
David Whelan, chairman, said the move would aim to raise around Pounds 20m
of new money, which is at the top end of previous forecasts.
He also expected the group to be valued at Pounds 60m, rather than the
Pounds 50m envisaged in April.
The listing will be achieved through a placing of 35 per cent of the shares
with institutions.
Mr Whelan and his family interests will retain 63.4 per cent, while
management will control the remainder.
The pathfinder prospectus is expected to be issued tomorrow.
'My belief is that the market will accept good companies whatever the
conditions, but I was persuaded otherwise', said Mr Whelan. 'However, the
improving environment will enable us to achieve a better value for the
company.'
JJB, which started as a single sports shop in Wigan 21 years ago, achieved
operating profits of Pounds 2.5m from turnover of Pounds 25m for the six
months ended July 31 1994.
The company's 107 stores are concentrated in the north west of England, the
Midlands and Scotland.
Charterhouse Tilney Securities are the sponsors and stockbrokers to the
issue.

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bimbos finding favour, 3i says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The structure of management buy-ins, a cousin of the more widely used
management buy-out, has changed markedly in the past four years, according
to research from 3i, the UK's largest supplier of private equity capital.
The hybrid Bimbo - which stands for buy-in manage-ment buy-out - accounts
for half of 3i's MBI deals, compared with about a quarter in 1990, the group
says.
3i says that venture capitalists now recognise the Bimbo as less risky than
the pure buy-in because the new team includes members of management already
working in the company.
At the same time, these MBI teams are increasingly being led by
entrepreneurs who have already made money in other entrepreneurial ventures,
3i says.
Nearly half the MBI teams 3i backs are now led by these 'second time
entrepreneurs' compared with less than 20 per cent in 1990. These
entrepreneurs will usually invest alongside the venture capitalists.
Mr Patrick Dunne, the 3i director in charge of the MBI programme, says the
group's experience is likely to be representative of a trend throughout the
industry.
3i has backed 300 MBIs since 1986, considerably more than any competitor.

Buckingham International, the lossmaking property and hotels group, has sold
a Portuguese subsidiary to an associate company of two Buckingham directors.
The aggregate consideration for Clima Sol, which owns a partially-finished
block of luxury apartments in Parede, is Pounds 400,000, less than 5 per
cent of the Pounds 9.2m which Buckingham paid Naaz Holdings for the company.
The sale will reduce its liabilities by Pounds 1.3m, which includes Pounds
600,000 of bank borrowings, the directors said.
The purchaser is Sentinel Holdings, a subsidiary of Naaz.

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: AAF lifted to Pounds 6.37m by disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AAF Industries, the building systems company which at the beginning of the
year announced that its overriding priority was survival, has announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.37m for the six months to June 30 against losses
of Pounds 11m.
This was achieved by the Pounds 19m sale of Alloy Wheels International,
contributing Pounds 9.44m.
Turnover was cut to Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 42m), with Pounds 12.1m from
continuing operations, producing an operating loss of Pounds 2.47m; AWI
contributed an operating profit of Pounds 567,000.
The company's core operations are now the Formscaff scaffolding business,
Lab Furnishings, and Premier Transline modular buildings.
To turn operating losses into profits, AAF is concentrating on 'value
engineering and reducing the cost of operations,' said Mr Peter Cook,
finance director.
Overheads have been reduced by 25 per cent and are being further
rationalised.
Interest charges remained high at Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 1.3m), but will
decrease following the cut in net debt to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 21.9m).
Earnings per share were 28p (losses of 58p).

FT  24 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ushers for the market with Pounds 100m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ushers, the Wiltshire-based brewer and pub chain, is planning to come to the
market next month.
The group, which is expected to have a market value of more than Pounds
100m, plans to raise enough money to clear its senior debt of Pounds 35m and
have some over for further expansion.
Ushers brewery in Trowbridge dates back to 1824, but the current company was
formed only in 1991 following the Beer Orders, which obliged the industry to
reduce the number of their tied houses.
The brewery and an unrelated estate of 433 pubs in south-west England and
south Wales were acquired through a Pounds 71m management buy-in from
Courage.
Mr Roger North, chief executive and former managing director of GrandMet
brewing, said the group had paid off Pounds 15m of debt in its three years
of existence, and had invested Pounds 13m in taking the number of pubs to
470, as well as modernising the brewery.
The results are due at the end of this month. Last year operating profits
were Pounds 13.4m on turnover of Pounds 48.8m.
Mr North said that the debt was structured in such a way that the interest
could not fall below 11 per cent.
The brewery is making 300,000 barrels of beer a year, using 24 hour shift
working to meet demand. Of this 200,000 barrels are under contract to
Courage - a figure that will fall by two-thirds in 1996.
The group is confident that it will be able to make up the shortfall with
work for other brewers and for the multiple retailers.
Sponsor will be NatWest Markets Corporate Finance, and broker NatWest Wood
Mackenzie.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Chicago exchanges may obtain limited exemptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will today rule on
applications by Chicago's two big futures exchanges for exemption from many
of the regulations that have governed the country's listed derivatives
markets.
The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
are seeking the same regulatory treatment for some exchange-listed contracts
as already exists in the over-the-counter market.
They argue that regulations, designed to protect individual rather than
corporate traders, make them increasingly uncompetitive against foreign
exchanges and the OTC market.
The exchanges' proposals would create two-tiered markets that would free
institutional, or 'professional' traders from many of the rules governing an
exchange's retail customers. It is also a politically sensitive issue, with
regulators and some politicians believing there should be further scrutiny
of rules governing derivatives trading.
The CFTC is today expected to offer the exchanges an opportunity to try the
requested exemptions on a limited basis for a few products, and will ask for
further public comment on this pilot programme.
The 'test' plan is likely to favour the CME, which is seeking regulatory
exemption only for its currency products known as 'rolling spot' futures.
The CBOT has asked the agency for a broad exemption for any products traded
on any US exchange which would be used primarily by institutional traders. A
narrower programme would force the exchange to define its plans more
closely.
The exchanges' proposals, submitted 18 months ago, have languished at the
CFTC after drawing fire from powerful opponents. The Federal Reserve wrote
to the CFTC in February saying exemptions might bring the exchanges'
financial integrity into question. 'A broad exemption from regulation for a
wholesale exchange does not appear to be appropriate at the present time,'
it said. The US Treasury and the Securities and Exchange Commission oppose
the proposals, and even allies, such as the Futures Industry Association,
have urged caution.

The big US airlines are on a roll, and United is the biggest of them all.
American and Northwest have both reported their best quarterly figures for
years, mainly because of cost-cutting. Earlier this year United gave workers
a 55 per cent stake in return for Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3bn) worth of wage
cuts and other concessions. Other cost-cutting should help produce a good
result. The consensus forecast for earnings per share is Dollars 5.72.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Pushed to meet dealers' high
expectations - Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and plumbing products,
is expected to report yet another year of record profits tomorrow.
Forecasts range between Pounds 185m and more than Pounds 200m for the year
to the end of July. The company has a history of exceeding City expectations
after talking itself down. Last year it came in with Pounds 121.1m when
analysts had pencilled in between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m.
But this year analysts expect the results to be more in line with
expectations, which could tell against it. The results might be good,
suggested one, but the shares could still slip precisely because they do not
top the forecasts by 10 to 20 per cent.
The improvement for the year will come from acquisitions and good organic
growth in the US and the UK.
Strong contributions are expected from Erb Lumber, the US distributor of
lumber and associated products bought for Pounds 51.1m last August, and the
first full year of Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas-burner manufacturer.
In the UK the Builders Merchants Federation reported growth of 10 to 12 per
cent, although much of it was in the heavier end of the market, such as
bricks. Wolseley is at the light end where growth has been slower.
The company has continued on the acquisition trail this year, paying Pounds
56.9m for the OAG Group, the biggest distributor of plumbing supplies in
Austria, in April and Pounds 28m for Calumet Holdings of the US in June.
The group, already the leading distributor of professional photographic
equipment in Europe, believes the purchase of Calumet will make it the
largest supplier in the world.
Investors are likely to ask further questions about succession at the
company. Mr Jeremy Lancaster, the chairman and managing director, is nearing
60.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Third US carmaker looks for better
ride - Ford
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the third-quarter earnings surprises sprung by Chrysler and General
Motors, what are investors to expect from Ford Motor, the last of the three
US carmakers to report?
Chrysler's surge in profits may have confirmed the strength of the North
American car and truck markets, but General Motors proved that the path to
recovery can still be a difficult one.
Ford's results, due on Wednesday, are likely to reflect a smoother ride in
North America than GM, which has suffered from strikes, production delays
and soaring costs. Earnings per share are expected to be 65-70 cents, down
from 79 cents (though earnings in the 1993 quarter benefited from tax
changes, which added 28 cents a share).

FT  24 OCT 94 / Nagging headaches smite financial giant: US's Prudential
seeks change of fortune with appointment from outside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Insurance Co of America has been going through a decidedly rocky
patch of late.
It is the US's biggest life insurance company, the second largest mortgage
lender and one of the leading managed healthcare groups. It owns a
stockbroking firm (Prudential Securities), a reinsurance company (Prudential
Re), and a growing credit card and lending business. With assets of Dollars
50bn (Pounds 32bn), it is also probably the leading insurance group in the
mutual fund industry (though it is still only a quarter the size of Fidelity
Investments).
In all, the Prudential, which is unrelated to the UK insurance group of the
same name, has Dollars 218bn of assets on its balance sheet and manages
another Dollars 155bn for pension funds, mutual fund investors and others.
Yet this market clout and a powerful capital base (Dollars 10.7bn at the end
of last year) has generated erratic and disappointing earnings. Post-tax
return on capital was only around 5 per cent in each of the past two years.
This year, the Prudential may end up with a loss. Also, the company's credit
standing has been slipping. At the beginning of 1992, it had a top
AAA-rating: now, after two downgrades, it lost some of its gold-plated
shine.
Had it been a public company, shareholders would have had something to say
about this. As it is, the company is a mutual, owned by its policyholders.
Now though, the company's own board of directors has decided it is time for
a change. Mr Robert Winters, the actuary who has been the group's chairman
and chief executive since 1988, will retire on December 1. Into his place
will step Mr Arthur Ryan, president of New York banking group Chase
Manhattan - the first person from outside the company (let alone the
insurance industry) to get the top job.
Although Mr Winters said as long ago as 1988 that he planned to retire
early, Prudential's recent traumas appear to have precipitated his
departure. 'It wasn't a surprise that he was going. What is more of a
surprise is the timing and the short transition,' said Mr Michael Albanese,
an analyst at AM Best, the US insurance rating agency.
Mr Ryan himself will only say: 'I think the board knew he wanted to retire
and decided it was a good opportunity to look around' for a replacement.
The choice of a banker in part reflects the Prudential's push into a broader
range of financial services during the 1980s. But this diversification is
also at the root of its problems. 'The complexity of the company has outrun
the ability of management to run it. They haven't grown with the business,'
says one person close to the company.
Three issues have cast a cloud. Foremost has been the investment scandal at
Prudential Securities, the stockbroker bought in 1981. During the 1980s, the
company's brokers promoted Dollars 8bn of risky property and energy
investments as though they were safe, and the parent company's impregnable
image helped sell the investments. The total cost of settling claims may top
Dollars 1bn (roughly the amount the group has set aside in provisions).
Long-term, the episode could impair Prudential's image, which has taken 119
years to build.
Second on Prudential's list of headaches have been the US property/casualty
and reinsurance businesses. Hurricane Andrew, which devastated the Florida
coastline in 1991, cost Prudential Dollars 1bn and its AAA rating. Like
other US insurers, the Prudential has set a high priority on limiting its
exposure to such catastrophe losses: it is now pulling back from the
property/casualty business, and plans to float its reinsurance arm.
Third, the group continues to struggle with a balance sheet weighed down
with underperforming property investments. Its Dollars 27.5bn of commercial
property and mortgages at the end of 1992 made it one of the biggest private
property owners in the world. In September 1993, underperforming property
assets amounted to 30 per cent of its huge capital base.
There is a belief in the investment community that not all potential losses
in Prudential's property portfolio have been provided for. 'If they had to
mark the portfolio to market, there would be some big hits there,' says one
person with knowledge of the assets.
As an insurer, with liabilities stretching years into the future, the
Prudential is not obliged to recognise losses that a company with a
shorter-term liability structure - a bank, for instance - would have to
report. 'Unless there's a permanent impairment (to the value of a property),
a life insurer really doesn't have to provide,' says Mr Chester Murray,
director of life insurance ratings at Moody's.
On top of all this, the Prudential is looking at a cyclical downturn in some
of the biggest parts of its business. Mortgage lending has tailed off this
year as US interest rates have risen. Stockbrokers are feeling the pain that
comes with the end of a bull run in securities markets.
Although the company publishes only a brief annual summary of its financial
condition, rating agencies, big creditors and others receive a more detailed
quarterly report. 'This year, results have been very disappointing,' says Mr
Albanese.
Mr Ryan's first actions are expected to be the appointment of a strong chief
financial officer (a job which has lain vacant) and the imposition of
greater operational and cost control on Prudential's disparate businesses.
'They'll have to compete more and more on costs,' says Mr Murray, pointing
out that life insurers now have to fight for investment business with banks,
mutual fund groups and others.
Mr Ryan's longer-term challenge, though, will be to decide just how many
businesses Prudential can manage successfully.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Dollar faces renewed pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar may come under further pressure this week after reaching a
post-war low against the yen in Friday's Asian trading.
However early today in Tokyo the US currency was steady, trading around the
Y97.4 level.
The main obstacle for the US currency appears to be lack of investor
confidence in the ability of US monetary authorities to act quickly enough
to control inflationary pressures.
Mr Avinash Persaud, analyst at J. P. Morgan, the investment bank, in London,
said: 'There are clear signals that the US economy is growing faster than
its long-term trend, while real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are
below their trend.'
With US mid-term elections due on November 8, traders expect the Federal
Reserve to wait until its next open-market committee meeting on November 15
before raising rates. 'The market has taken the view that the Fed is leaving
it too late if it waits,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ
International, the Japanese bank.
Even if the Fed does increase rates by half a point in November, analysts
fear that may not be enough. 'There is a growing perception that we may need
two further Fed increases before the end of the year,' Mr Hannah said. The
Fed has so far pushed through five rate rises this year, taking the Fed
funds rate from 3 per cent to 4.75 per cent.
The possibility of central bank intervention to support the dollar last week
prompted apparently conflicting remarks from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
secretary, and Mr Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's under-secretary of
international affairs.
The leading economic statistic of the week - US third-quarter gross domestic
product growth - will not be published until Friday. Mr Nick Parsons, chief
economist in London with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'The
first four trading days will be a very good test of sentiment. If the dollar
is to stabilise, it has the chance to do so in this data vacuum.'
The dollar closed in New York on Friday at Y97.235 and DM1.50025, having
touched Y96.5 and DM1.4880 in Tokyo.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Japan farm plan paves way for trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ratification of new world trade rules moved a step closer at the weekend
when Japan announced plans to spend Y6,010bn (Pounds 37.79bn) to help its
protected farmers adjust to foreign competition.
The decision is a victory for politicians from rural constituencies, who had
threatened to block the parliamentary vote on the Uruguay Round accord
unless the government included substantial cash aid in the farm programme.
Now the way is open for Japan's divided parliament to ratify the Uruguay
Round accord, under which a ban on rice imports would be gradually phased
out from next year and replaced with tariffs. Japan's main trading partners,
the EU and US, are unlikely to ratify the trade treaty until the end of next
month.
Until recently the three ruling coalition parties - the Liberal Democratic
party, the Social Democratic party and the New Harbinger party - had
officially opposed opening the rice market because of sensitivity towards
powerful rural voters, who stand to lose business to cheap foreign rice.
The weekend agreement to compensate rural communities means the parties will
change policy, so the government can present to parliament the five bills
needed to ratify the Gatt accord.
The coalition overruled finance ministry reluctance and decided to allocate
the cash, which is to be spent over the next six years.
Of the total, Y3,550bn is for public works including roads and draining
paddy fields; Y770m is for cheap state loans; and Y890m is to encourage
small rice farms to merge into larger, more efficient units.
Half the total will be shouldered by the central government, the rest by
municipal authorities. In addition, the government has earmarked Y1,200bn to
help rural regions develop new businesses, making a grand total of Y7,210bn.
The weekend decision follows weeks of wrangling between the agricultural
ministry and the ministry of finance, which had wanted to limit the package
to Y2,700bn - less than half its final size - and opposed debt relief.
While the package appears generous to Japan's farmers, it means they have
surrendered serious political support for their campaign to halt the
liberalisation of rice imports, a landmark in the deregulation of the
Japanese economy.
The former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa agreed to partial
liberalisation of the rice market last December, but delays seemed likely
when the present coalition took power in June.
The farmers' political clout is set to diminish further with the arrival of
a new electoral system - likely to take effect in January - in which urban
voters will be given more weight.

FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Depositary Receipts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the fastest growing businesses for London-based investment banks has
passed a small milestone. Tuesday marked the start of trading in the first
Global Depositary Receipts listed on the London Stock Exchange. GDRs are
negotiable certificates representing shares traded on exchanges not easily
accessible to foreign investors. By issuing shares in GDR form, tradeable in
major financial centres, the sponsor can offer the liquidity that foreign
institutions need.
Although smaller than the long-established American Depositary Receipts
market, the less demanding listing requirements for GDRs provide a cheap and
easy way to tap international investors and have proved increasingly popular
with emerging economy companies. Since the first GDRs were issued in 1990,
more than 100 companies, a third of them Indian, have raised a total of over
Dollars 10bn. Last week's issue sponsored by Merrill Lynch was fairly
typical, raising Dollars 40m for India's second largest hotels group, East
India Hotels.
Much of the business is done from London, with Goldman Sachs and Robert
Fleming the leading sponsors, and 90 depositary receipts are already traded
via SEAQ International. But they have until now been listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In August, the London Stock Exchange changed its
rules to allow GDRs to be listed. The move, part of the London exchange's
campaign to attract more international companies, is to be welcomed, though
it is odd it has taken four years.

FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no doubt that the Accounting Standards Board has done much to
tackle the accounting abuses which corroded UK financial reporting in the
1990s. But while its attempts to crack down on issues as various as
acquisition accounting and off-balance sheet finance can only be applauded,
the new rules have introduced fresh complexities.
The FRS3, for example, has obliged companies to provide on the face of the
profit and loss account information which in the past would have been
relegated to the notes, or not published at all. This gives observers a
better insight into how and where a company is generating its profits. But
the price of further detail can be confusion. The rules allow companies to
highlight the most favourable way of presenting earnings. This has already
spawned a bewildering variety of approaches, as shown by Ernst &amp; Young's
compendious review of UK accounting published today. Unsurprisingly,
companies tend to highlight earnings before exceptional costs. It is true
that the details of what constitutes an exceptional item are disclosed. But
the investor is presented with at least two versions of the 'bottom line' -
the official one and the management's self-flattering version.
Analysts will carry on seeking the holy grail of yardsticks which give a
good indication of a company's maintainable earnings and which are
comparable from one company to the next. But investors should remember that
attempts to boil down a company's performance to a few key statistics are
simplistic.

Following the flop of Japan Tobacco's privatisation, the country's finance
ministry has finally got the message: its system for floating companies is
flawed. The method has a bias which means new issues are typically sold at
artificially high prices. So long as investors were willing to pay over the
odds, high prices from privatisations suited the ministry. Shareholders
might suffer large capital losses - as in last year's JR East privatisation
 -but the ministry raked in extra funds.
Japan Tobacco was different. Small shareholders rebelled at the high price
and more than 40 per cent of the issue was left unsold. Those who did buy
are likely to be rewarded by a sharp decline in the share price when trading
starts this week. But the ministry has also suffered because the issue
brought in much less than hoped. More important, the government must realise
there is little chance of drumming up investor interest for issues such as
West Japan Railway and the next tranche of NTT so long as the current system
remains in place.
The method's main flaw is that the issue price is determined by an auction
for only a third of the available stock. This auction draws in the biggest
and most enthusiastic investors with the result that the price picked is
likely to exaggerate what shareholders are prepared to pay for the whole
issue. Friday's announcement of a review by the finance minister is
therefore welcome. If Tokyo switches to some version of the 'book-building'
process common in global markets, it will be doing not only investors but
itself a favour.

FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Dollar doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Remarks on Friday by a US Treasury official suggesting that the
administration would be prepared to intervene in currency markets brought a
brief respite for the dollar. But the currency is still in a sick condition
 -only a touch above its post-war low against the yen and two-year low
against the D-Mark. The market remains concerned that the Federal Reserve
has not taken strong enough action to control incipient inflation. Until
overseas investors are convinced that the Fed is on top of the problem, they
will have no incentive to switch into dollar assets.
Further talking up of the currency by Treasury officials would achieve
little. Even buying dollars in the market would have only a temporary
impact. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that Japan, whose
exporters are suffering from the high yen, has called for joint intervention
by the Group of Seven. Such a co-ordinated defence of the dollar might have
some effect. But it is unlikely to materialise since the Bundesbank is happy
with a strong D-Mark which helps control German inflation.
Further interest rate rises by the Fed are therefore the only real option.
Given that a half-point rise has already been discounted, a full percentage
point increase would be needed to change market sentiment. The US may not
worry much about the dollar per se because trade makes up a relatively small
portion of its economy. But it cannot ignore the impact on Treasury bond
yields which are back at 8 per cent. Nor should it ignore the message that
the currency markets are telling about US inflation.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Kuwait link with Tory party funds: Interest on loan deposits
donated by foreign-financed bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party received ten of thousands of pounds in secret
contributions from a merchant bank with close links to the Kuwait
government.
According to documents obtained by the Financial Times, the bank, Robert
Fraser and Partners, was financed to a substantial extent by a Panamanian
corporation, Blackford Holdings Corporation, which itself received about
Pounds 100m from the Kuwait government.
Robert Fraser and Partners made the political payments by putting money on
deposit with the Conservative party's bank and giving instructions that all
interest should be transferred to the party.
The disclosure of this complex mechanism for making payments to the
Conservative party, involving finance from a foreign government, will add to
pressure for reform of the way in which UK political parties are financed.
Mr David Blunkett, the former Labour party chairman, said that to 'avoid any
inference of impropriety', all parties should refuse overseas contributions
and should disclose all donations in excess of Pounds 2,000.
Robert Fraser and Partners, which had several leading Conservatives as
directors and consultants, placed deposits of about Pounds 200,000 in a
special account with the Conservative party's bankers and gave instructions
that all interest should be transferred to the Conservative party.
The arrangement was in place for approximately three years in the mid 1980s.
At rates of interest prevailing at the time, the Conservative party would
have received tens of thousands of pounds.
The bank's annual reports show only small contributions to the
Conservatives: in 1986, a payment of Pounds 2,000 to its Industrial Fund, a
fund-raising arm of the party, and the following year a contribution of
Pounds 5,000 to the party itself.
Robert Fraser and Partners' business was closely linked to Blackfords'. The
Panamanian company accounted for more than half of all deposits placed with
the bank, according to a Bank of England analysis.
Blackford itself was financed to a substantial extent by the Kuwait
government. It received Pounds 86m in cash from Kuwait, via the London-based
Kuwait Investment Office, in 14 contributions between February 24 1984 and
July 23 1990. In a letter to the KIO on December 11 1991, Robert Fraser
requested a further Pounds 15m injection for Blackford.
Robert Fraser and Partners' board was chaired by Lord Rippon, the former
Conservative cabinet minister. Another director was the Tory MP, Mr Nicholas
Soames. Sir Dennis Walters, a Conservative MP at the time, was a consultant
to the bank as well as an adviser to the Kuwait Investment Office. Lady
Archer, the wife of the best-selling novelist and former Conservative party
deputy chairman, Lord Archer, was also a consultant to the group.
The plan of transferring interest to the party was the brainchild of Mr
Colin Emson, Fraser's chief executive, who for years had been a leading
member of the Conservative Industrial Fund, a group of industrialists and
bankers who raise cash from business for fighting elections.
Mr Emson hoped it would in effect be a pilot for a far more ambitious party
fund-raising scheme, which would have involved big public companies making
interest-free loans to the Conservative party. The party would have placed
the cash on deposit and pocketed the interest.
The rationale was that public companies would not have needed to disclose
the loans, although they must disclose direct contributions.
Lord McAlpine, then the party's honorary Treasurer, rejected the proposal,
because he was concerned that raising money in that way might be seen as
breaching the spirit of the law, if not the letter.
Robert Fraser and Partners surrendered its banking licence on September 30
1992. Much of its loan portfolio was transferred to Aston Finance
Corporation, another Panamanian company linked to Blackford.

In philanthropic mood, Observer offers the following advice to John Major in
his aim of cleansing government. Send the following round-robin letter to
all Tory MPs. It's modelled on that sent to Tim Smith, accepting his
resignation from the Northern Ireland office. Recipients with easy
consciences could return it with the blanks unfilled.
Dear X,
I understand you may have had a relationship with ------ in the 1980s. At
the risk of being obvious, was it something you are now a little shamefaced
about? Did you manage completely to cover your tracks?
If not, it will be no good going to the cabinet secretary and mumbling
something along the lines of: 'Well, everyone else was doing it.'
Please assist by tendering your resignation if you think anyone might get
whiff of something nasty.
I will, of course, regret your leaving because of the excellent beginning
you have made in ------.
Still, if we're to have a snowball's chance in hell of winning the next
election you had better push off. Sharpish.
Yours ever,
John.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Analysts in Germany are sensing the need to develop thick skins. No sooner
had the stock market absorbed the result of last week's narrow election
victory by chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, than a Deutsche Bank
analysts' team in Dusseldorf recommended a sell for German shares. They
suggested the government was too weak and the political climate was moving
leftwards.
This was too much for the bank's bosses in Frankfurt. They took the highly
unusual step of distancing themselves from the views of the Dusseldorf
analysts, saying they did not reflect the bank's opinions.
Down in Munich, another analyst, from Bayerische Vereinsbank, has received a
taste of corporate spleen from Computer 2000, the German computer dealer. It
took exception to a study it thought too short-term in outlook and publicly
castigated the conclusions of 'a young analyst'. What's youth got to do with
it?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another US stereotype bites the dust. It's incorrectly thought by some that
the Washington Post automatically endorses Democratic candidates. In fact,
it occasionally blesses a moderate Republican or two in its suburban
hinterland, like Connie Morella from Maryland, who on four occasions has
received the newspaper's seal of approval.
But for the Post, with its great liberal Democratic traditions, to opt for a
Republican on its home turf takes a bit of doing. Step forward Marion Barry,
Democrat candidate for mayor. The Post has now formally endorsed his
Republican opponent, Carol Schwartz, in next month's election.
Close observers of the Post have long thought that Donald Graham, publisher,
and Len Downie, editor, have had enough of Barry, now claiming 'personal
redemption' and seeking a fourth term, after being being confined on a
cocaine conviction to a federal prison.
The opening sentence of its lead editorial endorsing Schwartz even ate some
humble pie. 'In 1986, in an editorial we wish we could take back, this
newspaper endorsed Marion Barry for a third term as mayor,' it said - and
then went on to blame him for fiscal and social policy mismanagement on a
grand scale.
But does the Post's endorsement help or hinder? The Morella campaign thought
it crucial to her first election in 1986, though it didn't help John Ray,
defeated by Barry in September's Democratic primary. Though in a city where
Republicans are an endangered species, Schwartz is unlikely to complain.

Anyone want a diary? Each of the 567 members of the European parliament gets

plastic pocket diaries and 1,200 matching blotter sets.
Look to Italy for an answer, where a Pounds 190,000 bulk purchase -
including 1,200 large desk diaries in blue calf leather, with the 12 gold

John Major's government presumably doesn't hope to win many hearts and minds
at next weekend's Middle East economic conference in Casablanca.
The three-day conference - hosted by Morocco's King Hassan - gathers senior
representatives from nearly 1,000 companies and top politicians. It's all
about working out major projects for Middle East development.
Last week in London Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin let it be known he
hoped for some heavy-hitting UK representation. So Britain is sending
Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the Foreign Office.
That hasn't exactly delighted senior Moroccan officials, who reckon Hogg
lacks the sort of clout they hoped to see from the UK. They wanted foreign
secretary Douglas Hurd or Major himself.
They might have a point. After all, US secretary of state Warren
Christopher, Russian foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev, Rabin and his foreign
minister Shimon Peres are all planning to go along.
So too are Yassir Arafat, along with the assorted prime ministers of Italy,
Spain, Portugal, France and - probably - German chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Perhaps Hogg is being groomed for greater things. Maybe Major and Hurd are
terribly busy.
Of course, it's conceivable that Major has had enough of businessmen
influencing politicians to last him a lifetime.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Leading Article: A grip on the Commission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week Mr Jacques Santer faces the first big test of his leadership and
deal-making skills since he was named as next president of the European
Commission last summer. He has called a meeting of fellow commissioners on
Saturday to settle the distribution of portfolios for the five-year term
that begins in January. Baronial battles between commissioners with a
particularly high esteem for their own abilities are in predictably full
swing.
Completing the process this week matters less than getting these
appointments right. The European Union faces a complex and contentious
agenda, and the Commission has a vital role to play both in managing the
changes now under way and in brokering the difficult trade-offs between
member states likely to be necessary in the coming years. It needs to focus
clearly on the weightiest tasks by placing them in the most capable hands.
As important, Mr Santer - nobody's first choice for the job - needs to
establish his own authority over the political agenda and over the
Commission's internal workings.
In both spheres the need for action is urgent. The Commission in the dying
months of Mr Jacques Delors's 10-year presidency presents a sorry spectacle:
dogged by poor morale and petty in-fighting, its dealings with the member
states hampered by mutual mistrust and legal disputes. In a whole range of
policy areas - from state aids to industry through enforcement of
agricultural reform to EU policy towards the Balkans - there is a damaging
impression of drift. It is for Mr Santer to seize the initiative.
Substantial consensus
In one sense conditions are propitious for him to do so, for the current
bickering between member states disguises the fact that there is a
substantial consensus about two broad things the new Commission should be
doing.
First, it should focus not on elaborating Delors-style grand visions or
fighting turf wars with the Council but on using its substantial treaty
powers to make the existing Union work. That means an enhanced effort to
smooth out irregularities in the internal market, to ensure free and fair
competition and to improve industrial competitiveness. It also means being
realistic about what can be achieved at the 1996 Inter-Governmental
Conference on institutional reform - an event which if mishandled could
easily sidetrack the Union into acrimonious and futile constitutional
wrangling.
Mr Santer should take particular care with the internal market portfolio, in
which, regrettably, none of the Commission's heavyweights has thus far
expressed interest. The lack of an aggressive Commission push on the single
market has been the biggest disappointment of the past two years, and
urgently needs redressing as the EU admits up to four more members and its
core member states gear up for the third phase of monetary union. In no
other area is there a bigger risk of the EU's losing credibility with its
citizens or businesses.
Strategic priorities
Second, the Commission - already unwieldy with 17 members and about to
become still more so with the addition of four more - should develop a
clearer sense of strategic priorities than it has displayed of late,
especially with regard to external relations. Mr Santer is right to judge
that Mr Delors's division of external relations between a political
portfolio (held by Mr Hans Van den Broek) and an economic one (Sir Leon
Brittan) has not worked. He is also correct to want to take overall charge
of external relations himself by chairing a Commission sub-group on the
subject - not least because the most important issue in external policy,
relations with central and eastern Europe, will have a profound influence on
the Union itself in coming years.
Mr Santer's first task early next year will be to draw up a white paper on
preparing the central and eastern Europeans for eventual EU membership. That
will involve the entire Commission, not just the two men who are currently
squabbling over the eastern Europe portfolio. And if it is wise, it will
focus equal scrutiny on what the applicant countries need to do to prepare
and on how the Union needs to adapt to admit them. That would be the most
practical route-map to take the Union towards the millennium.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Dollar decline (continued)
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the reputation of economic forecasters has sustained damage in recent
years, the sub-branch of the trade that seeks to predict currency movements
has seen its credibility pretty well shredded. The perpetrator in chief has
been the dollar, the decline of which against both the yen and the D-Mark
this year has confounded the great majority of pundits.
The general assumption in January was that rising interest rates in the US,
combined with slow recovery in Europe and Japan, would ensure a cyclical
rebound in the dollar. Huge portfolio positions were built on this
near-unanimous market view, often on borrowed money. The rest, so to speak,
is hysteria, as both bond rates and currencies have danced to a different
tune in an uncertain key. Why have currencies so dramatically defied
predictions?
Part of the problem has been that interest rates did not come down to the
expected extent in Germany and Japan. The markets have also worried that the
trade dispute between the US and Japan gave the Clinton administration an
interest in a weak dollar in order to apply pressure to the Japanese. Yet
the more powerful influence has been a shift in the structure of capital
flows.
With Japan projected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development to run a current account surplus of nearly Dollars 130bn this
year, while the US runs a deficit of just over Dollars 140bn, the natural
direction for capital to go is from the world's biggest creditor to its
biggest debtor country. But Japanese investors have been reluctant to play
their part in this process.
One reason is that they have incurred large accumulated losses on foreign
investments, not least because of the yen's structural tendency towards
appreciation. Another is that the relative bond returns in Japan are
seductive.
Japanese investors
At current rates of inflation - nil for Japan, about 3 per cent for the US -
the real yield on 10-year bonds in Japan last week was 4.7 per cent compared
with 4.9 per cent in the US. That provides little protection for Japanese
investors against further dollar weakness.
The picture could be even more stark. Some analysts are predicting a
deflationary fall of as much as 10 per cent in the Japanese price level over
the rest of the decade, in which case real yields in Japan could be nearer 6
per cent. Even cash would afford a real yield of 2 per cent in such
deflationary circumstances. The temptation for Japanese investors to forsake
domestic bonds for overseas IOUs is thus minimal. And in equities, Wall
Street remains very fully valued.
US deficit
On the US side, meantime, long-term portfolio capital is no more inclined to
flow in the direction that the current account deficit requires than in
Japan. US pension funds and mutual funds have been trying to reap the
benefit of international diversification, which is supposed to bring higher
returns for a given degree of risk.
Against the background of a rising US current account deficit and a growing
net outflow of direct investment, a Dollars 37bn swing last year from inflow
to net portfolio outflow contributed significantly to dollar weakness. The
timing and extent of such changes in stocks, as opposed to flows, is
notoriously difficult to predict. But the course of long-term capital will
in time change. What could bring that about?
If US bond rates were to rise and Wall Street were to collapse, both US and
Japanese investors might see dollar-denominated assets in a different light.
And since markets have moved so much together this year, the US enthusiasm
for foreign investment has not offered much diversification benefit.
Enthusiasm may thus wane. It is noteworthy, too, that after the annualised
Dollars 140bn inflow of foreign capital into the Tokyo equity market in the
first quarter of 1994, the flow fell to Dollars 50bn a year in the second
quarter.
What is reasonably certain is that the US current account deficit, which is
still the biggest number influencing the supply of dollars to the rest of
the world, has peaked. Yet the behaviour of Japanese capital remains hard to
predict. In due course cyclical economic factors will reassert their
influence vis a vis long-term capital flows and the dollar will have its
rebound. But the only safe short-term forecast is for further instability.

FT  24 OCT 94 / The high cost of bad advice: A UK regulator's report which
offers hope for victims of a pensions debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Edge, an unemployed machine-tool fitter in Preston, Lancashire, would
not normally pay much attention to the pronouncements of the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
But this week he is on alert for a potentially explosive report from the SIB
setting out how tens of thousands of UK investors may be able to claim
damages for having been poorly advised when they bought personal pensions.
Even moderate estimates for the total compensation start at about Pounds
500m.
Mr Edge took out his personal pension in 1990 after losing his job at
Leyland Bus, the vehicle company owned by Volvo of Sweden. He was persuaded
to transfer a lump sum of Pounds 26,000 from the Leyland pension scheme to a
new personal pension.
Mr Edge is unsure whether he made the right move - despite long discussions
with the financial adviser who recommended the transfer and who has since
assured him that the advice was good. Mr Edge, aged 52, plans to start
drawing his pension in three years but is worried that when he does so, the
cash could be significantly less than if he had left the lump sum in the
Leyland scheme.
'When I made the move, all the pressure was on me to switch into a new
pension; no one told me about the potential advantages of staying put,' he
said.
The SIB report, which will be published tomorrow, is expected to give Mr
Edge the prospect that his case will be looked at again. The report,
anxiously awaited by the retail financial services sector from the largest
life insurers to the smallest independent financial advisers, will set out
guidelines for compensating people who have been wrongly sold personal
pensions.
'I've been in various financial crises, and I've never seen anything as
messy or as big as this,' one senior industry figure said.
It was late last year that a pilot study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat
Marwick first raised the possibility that large numbers of people had been
'mis-sold' personal pensions on transferring a lump sum from a former
employer's scheme.
More than 500,000 pension transfers have been sold since they became
available in 1988. The KPMG study suggested that in nine out of 10 cases,
the recommendation to transfer to a personal pension had not been based on
adequate information. Concern then spread to cases where people had opted
out of an occupational scheme run by their employer to buy a personal
pension.
The resulting widespread public concern about the standards of pension sales
agents has led to a sharp drop in the sales of personal pensions. The life
companies now also face higher costs in meeting the tougher regulatory
standards - to prevent the 'mis-selling' of pensions in the future - which
the SIB announced in March.
However, it is the question of how to provide compensation for past
mistakes, the subject of tomorrow's report, that most exercises life
companies and advisers. Despite widespread consultation on its contents,
there is likely to be opposition to the SIB's proposals, with at least one
of the large life companies considering a legal challenge to test whether
they are bound to comply with the regulator's proposals.
Life companies' concerns about what they expect from the SIB cover not only
compensation payments but the process of spotting cases that should qualify
for compensation. With cases of transfers out of former employers' pension
schemes, the priority will be to review the cases of people who have already
retired and those close to retirement. Others will be dealt with over a
longer period.
The total compensation for transfer cases may not, however, be the
industry's biggest problem. There are circumstances in which taking a
pension transfer was the right thing to do. Even where financial advice was
not valid, the compensation involved could be relatively small.
'In transfers, even where the decision was based on bad advice, the
difference is fairly marginal,' according to an industry expert.
The most contentious issues now surround what to do about pension opt-outs,
where people taking out a personal pension might have done better in their
employer's pension scheme.
One problem is identifying cases of 'mis-selling' in such circumstances. The
number is thought to be much smaller than the number of transfers, but they
are hard to pick out from files which may not show whether someone buying a
personal pension was eligible to join a company pension scheme.
The SIB is expected to say that all employed people who bought personal
pensions since 1988 must be contacted, to see whether they were eligible for
occupational pension scheme membership. This would be a massive and
expensive exercise, particularly for individuals and companies which have
poor records.
A second problem is definition. While someone who has left an employer's
scheme to take a personal pension is clearly an 'opt out', there are some
personal pension holders who were - or would have become - eligible to join
a company scheme. Whether a sales agent or adviser checked eligibility and
advised staying out and taking a personal pension instead, could be decisive
elements in assessing how much compensation should be paid.
Ms Susanne Long, a 30-year-old marketing manager at the UK subsidiary of US
computer company International Business Machines, is a 'non-joiner'. She
started a personal pension in 1989, even though she had the option of
joining an occupational scheme with her employer. She is now claiming
compensation from the life company, saying it should have told her then that
a better choice would have been to join the occupational scheme.
The compensation for such cases could be enormous where the person affected
is still with the same employer. They would need enough money to match the
lost pension rights and reflect benefits for future years' service.
On this issue, there is a crumb of comfort for the life companies. The
National Association of Pension Funds is encouraging occupational schemes to
allow people who have opted out to rejoin for future service. If this advice
is followed, the life companies and advisers may still have to provide
compensation to make up for the years missed. But they would not face the
prospect of having to provide a defined set of benefits many years hence.
While the life companies are struggling with such identification and
compensation problems, the task may be almost impossible for thousands of
small independent financial advisers.
Among regulators and the big life companies, there is an assumption that
large numbers of small advisers, with few staff and relatively little
capital, will be forced out of business by the task.
There is also the problem of dealing with pensions sold by independent
advisers who no longer exist. A unit is being set up by the Personal
Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private investor, to
review such cases. The bill will have to be picked up by the rest of the
financial services sector, where those who have not sold pensions will
resist attempts to involve them.
Even with the publication of the SIB report, the scale of pensions
'mis-selling' will remain unknown. And it will take a long time for the
industry and its customers to put the issue behind them.
'I am embarrassed by the episode,' said a former marketing director who took
a pension transfer which he now believes could need a large top-up. 'I was
greedy and took poor advice. I want the SIB report to outline a way I can
back into my old scheme as quickly and as painlessly as possible.'
Whatever the SIB says, the process is unlikely to be quick or painless
enough for anyone involved.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Personal View: Partnership can lead to social justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER HASKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to dismiss notions of social justice as a smoke screen for
government intervention, an excuse for politicians to meddle in things that
do not concern them.
But as the Commission on Social Justice will emphasise today when we present
our strategy for work and welfare, social justice cannot be divorced from
economic prosperity.
The government has failed to realise this. It has followed the simple idea
that the fewer the rules, the more prosperous we will be. Convinced that
cheaper production is the key to competitiveness, it has single-mindedly set
about destroying the laws and institutions that govern the market. As a
result, the UK is spending more than Pounds 1bn a year supplementing low pay
through family credit.
This obsessive pursuit of a low-skills, low-investment strategy is doomed.
Our future prosperity depends upon our ability to compete with high-skill
economies rather than the low-wage economies of the developing and
newly-industrialised nations.
Successful UK companies already know this. They attach great importance to
teamwork and co-operation. They practise high standards of human relations,
offer good wages, pensions and working conditions, provide clear and
effective communication, long-term commitment and reasonable protection
against redundancy. In return they expect and receive a high degree of
commitment, and increased productivity, from their staff and suppliers.
But the workplace and the nature of work are changing. Traditional,
low-skilled industries find it virtually impossible to compete with
countries such as China where wages are as low as Dollars 1 a day.
Intelligent European businesses recognise that the only way forward is to
invest in innovation and modern technology to create value-added products
that are affordable. A massive change in the skills of the workforce is
needed to succeed in making this transformation.
Business must also respond to the changes that have brought millions of
women into the workplace and transformed family structures. We must welcome
these changes and adapt to them rather than resist them. Working patterns
must enable women and men to cope with the demands of the family.
The Commission has set out recommendations to help business, individuals and
government meet economic and social change head on.
First we need an education revolution to provide the basis for economic
progress and social justice by opening up learning opportunities to people
in and out of work. We cannot return to the era of jobs for life, but we can
ensure that people remain employable. This requires commitment from
employers and individuals. All but the very smallest employers should plough
a minimum proportion of payroll back into training their workforces - the
best already do. People benefiting from higher education must be prepared to
contribute to learning costs. We suggest ways of harnessing funds from
government, employers and learners to help expand education and training.
Second, life on the dole creates social division and economic waste.
Unemployment is now a spectre that haunts the Treasury and City institutions
as much as shipyard workers on the Tyne. The aim must be to get people -
especially long-term unemployed - off welfare and into work.
The Commission's strategy includes a modern, flexible social insurance
system; benefit reforms to enable people to take up part-time work; support
for the self-employed; and wage subsidies to get the long-term unemployed
back into jobs.
Third, only through having loyal and committed workers can employers keep
pace with competition. But employers must be prepared to show commitment in
return. This means fair rewards through a carefully set minimum wage,
recognising and accommodating family responsibilities, and reducing the
segregation between men's and women's work.
The aspirations of the European Union's Social Chapter hold no fears for any
responsible, progressive British company and the government should sign it.
The UK cannot hope to prosper if it continues along the road of mindless
deregulation. Ours must be a future of investment and partnership:
investment in people, communities and enterprise, and partnership between
business, individuals, communities and government. As an industrialist, I
cannot envisage sustained business success for any company that refuses to
accept the responsibilities of partnership.

Social Justice

FT  24 OCT 94 / The North-South divide narrows: Pyongyang's nuclear accord
with Washington could lead to a united Korean peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The nuclear agreement between the US and North Korea signed last Friday
could prove a turning point for the Korean peninsula.
The deal looks set to reverse North Korea's flagging economic fortunes and
increase the links between North and South - offering the best hope yet for
the reunification of the two countries, divided since 1945.
Promises of improved diplomatic ties, and security guarantees, should
encourage North Korea to open to foreign investment and goods, as well as
energy supplies. However, mutual distrust could still unravel the deal's mix
of concessions and incentives.
North Korean reform has already gathered momentum this year. The death in
July of President Kim Il-sung, the country's only leader since its
establishment in 1948, marked the end of the old guard, which favoured the
policy of juche (self-reliance).
The expected assumption of power by his son, Mr Kim Jong-il, in the next few
weeks will strengthen the influence of a younger generation of technocrats,
who support an opening of the country and appear to have the approval of the
new leader.
This emerging class argues that North Korea must change course to avoid
economic collapse. Dwindling economic aid in the past four years from
Russia, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and China has led to
energy and food shortages and a 5 per cent annual contraction of the
economy.
'North Korea is shifting from the aggressive guerrilla-style communism of
Kim Il-sung and his dream of forced reunification of the Korean peninsula to
a pragmatic policy of emphasising domestic economic issues and maintaining
political control a la China,' said Mr Michael Breen, editor of Korea
Countdown, a Seoul-based newsletter on North Korea.
The role of North Korean technocrats in the complex nuclear negotiations of
the past 19 months supports the view that Pyongyang has exploited
international concerns over its nuclear programme to win diplomatic and
economic support for its economic revival.
North Korea 'has finally got everyone's attention,' said Mr Stephen Linton
of the Center for Korean Studies at Columbia University in the US. 'After
almost a half century of enmity' between North Korea and the US, they 'seem
to be sincerely committed to making progress toward a lasting peace.'
North Korea has certainly reaped significant economic benefits from the
nuclear agreement. In return for abandoning its nuclear programme, which is
capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium, the country will receive oil
supplies from the west, followed by safer modern light-water reactors. These
will help the country deal with the chronic energy problems that have been
the prime cause of its economic troubles.
The US has also promised improved diplomatic ties, which could clear the way
for additional western aid and trade. The easing or lifting of the US trade
embargo against North Korea could allow the country to join the Asian
Development Bank and the World Bank. This would give it access to
multilateral financing, which could be used to support the development of
free economic zones for foreign investment and to repair the country's
crumbling roads and railways.
The normalisation of relations with the US would also encourage improved
links with Japan, which could bring billions of dollars in reparations from
Tokyo for its colonial occupation of Korea.
The security guarantees given by the US as part of the nuclear deal may also
see Pyongyang's attitude to the outside world become less paranoid. The US
has pledged that its nuclear weapons will never be used against North Korea,
and has agreed to suspend the annual large-scale US-South Korean 'Team
Spirit' military exercises.
Such notable diplomatic gains, so soon after his father's death, are likely
to bolster Mr Kim Jong-il's prestige and remove doubts among possible rivals
about his capability to run the country.
Nonetheless, Pyongyang is taking risks in accepting the nuclear agreement.
North Korea will become dependent on its former enemies in the west for
crucial energy supplies, including oil and enriched uranium to fuel its new
reactors. This will give Washington unprecedented leverage in influencing
future developments in the North, unless Pyongyang can find alternative
sources, such as China.
A more serious danger for Pyongyang is that growing foreign influence could
undermine a government that has built public support on decades of intense
and ceaseless propaganda.
'Kim Jong-il knows that a major relaxation would permit people to focus on
the internal causes of their troubles, which is the regime itself and the
system it enforces,' said Mr Bradley Martin, a Fulbright scholar who is
preparing a book on North Korea.
Mr Breen adds: 'The dilemma for North Korea is that it needs to open, but
the question is how much without causing internal troubles.'
Pyongyang is betting on economic aid halting the slide in living standards,
and on increased domestic production of consumer goods by both foreign and
local companies. But some analysts believe North Korea cannot save its
economy without widespread reforms that would dismantle its
centrally-planned economy and weaken political control.
The nuclear agreement is also risky for the US and its South Korean ally.
The delay in international inspections of some of the North's nuclear
facilities gives Pyongyang several more years to perfect at least one atomic
bomb from the plutonium it may have already reprocessed.
Moreover, some officials in Seoul are concerned that Washington's promise
never to launch a nuclear strike against North Korea leaves South Korea
vulnerable by removing it from the US nuclear umbrella.
They predict that once Pyongyang achieves diplomatic ties with the US, it
will increase pressure on Washington to sign a formal treaty ending the
1950-1953 Korean war and to withdraw 40,000 American troops from South
Korea.
Seoul has gained one important advantage from the nuclear agreement,
however. If implemented, the treaty is more likely to bring a gradual
reunification of the two Koreas, than a sudden collapse of the North,
requiring a costly rescue by the South.
The turmoil caused by the German unification process has prompted fear among
South Koreans of the effects of a similar process on their own doorstep.
Rapid unification with a broken economy might cripple South Korea's efforts
to become an advanced industrial nation by forcing it to divert scarce
resources to reconstruct the North. According to some government estimates,
such a process could cost as much as Dollars 250bn-Dollars 400bn over 10
years.
Instead, the nuclear pact opens the way for South Korea to start investing
in the North, laying the foundation for a smooth merger of the two Koreas in
perhaps the next decade or two.
The South's leading conglomerates, or chaebol, are already preparing plans,
with Pyongyang's approval, to establish light industrial factories in the
North. Seoul's central role in constructing the new light-water reactors for
North Korea will also begin the process of connecting the two countries'
infrastructures.
But much could go wrong during the nuclear agreement's protracted timetable.
The North Koreans are tough bargainers and may try to exploit the terms of
the accord to wring new concessions from the west, such as the conclusion of
a US-North Korean peace treaty. Much will also depend on Mr Kim Jong-il's
ability to deliver Pyongyang's side of the bargain - and he is thought to be
in poor health.
The agreement has begun a process that will gather momentum. It has struck a
fine balance between North Korea's economic gains and the world's security
gains: unification could quickly turn the Koreas into one of the world's
economic powerhouses. But it remains an ambitious undertaking.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Stimulate investment for long term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J H MULVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Two headlines on page 10 of your October 20 edition say: 'CBI warns
employers to cut unit labour costs', and 'The case for an imaginative
budget'.
The first features the Confederation of British Industry's concerns over
rising wages at a time when UK productivity is less than that of the US,
Germany and Japan. But the CBI also warned that investment in the UK is well
behind that of other countries.
South Korean industry, for example, spends more on research and development,
as a percentage of gross domestic product, than industry in the UK, and
employs more graduate scientists and engineers. The Seoul government has
announced the aim of raising total national investment in R&amp;D to 4 per cent
of GDP, twice the UK level, by the end of the century.
An 'imaginative budget' would take actions to stimulate and help industrial
investment, especially for small and medium-sized companies, and introduce
measures to counteract the endemic short-termism prevailing in industry and
the financial markets. Countries such as South Korea know that long-term
productivity and competitiveness depend on investments made today.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Death of healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FREDRIC STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Although dated October 19, Mr Tim Hames's article, 'US healthcare: the
issue that won't die', has the curious appearance of an ancient relic when
measured politically. While addressing the matter of 'Who killed
healthcare?', he claims that the irony is that the White House has won on
healthcare.
In fact, the irony is that President Bill Clinton's ratings have risen only
since he has engaged himself in the foreign policy of the US, and he and his
peppery spouse along with the Congress have dropped out of the war on
American healthcare.
And all this time I had been believing rumours that healthcare change died
as a result of a plot by foreign agents provocateurs; where will the
Canadians get treatment if US healthcare goes down the socialised road to
medical oblivion?

FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: A natural order of luxury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JORGE EDUARDO NAVARRETTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was very much amused by Tony Walker's dispatch on the use of luxury
cars by Chinese Communist party cadres ('Chinese officials lose a touch of
luxury', October 17). It is not the first time that an attempt to impose
austerity on them has been made.
I was in Peking in late 1989, when the dust of the infamous Tiananmen Square
'incident' was starting to settle and when a similar directive was issued.
It produced a very funny result: high officials were driven in old
Chinese-made cars, followed by two or more shining deluxe European cars
stuffed with security personnel. After several weeks the natural order of
things was quietly restored. I assume the same will happen again.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Redefining the Treasury role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Terry Burns' belief that 'the Treasury should not remodel itself as
merely the finance department of UK plc' is correct ('Civil Service
Reorganisation: Mandarins try to please the critics', October 20). It is in
fact the Treasury's financial control functions which should be taken away
so that it becomes only the Ministry of Economics (It was in trying to start
up a competitive ministry that the then prime minister Harold Wilson made
one of his many mistakes.) The Treasury could also inherit some of the
regulatory trade functions of the Department of Trade and Industry with
consequent savings there.
The Treasury may have a poor record in forecasting, but anyone who has had
anything to do with it knows that its ability to handle budgeting and
financial control is even worse. We need a new ministry with new people who
understand these things.
What is required is an inquiry into the system as it works at the moment,
including the auditing function and parliamentary scrutiny, and some
consideration of alternatives (including those methods used by our EU
partners).
This must be done by a group which has internal civil service and external
industrial and financial experience and not by the Treasury's inspectors,
another group which in my experience fell far short of what was necessary to
discharge the function.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Chaos (theory) in modern business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH ARMITAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, During the past decade there has been a plethora of management theories
and practices such as 'human resource management', 'total quality
management', 'downsizing', 're-engineering', 'flatter management
structures'. More recently we have had 'upward appraisals'.
Most of these theories are US imports and are designed, apparently, to
confuse the fundamental management principle of command and control through
responsibility and accountability.
Tony Kippenberger's statement that 'much of today's management theory is
being questioned', (Letters, October 13), necessarily leads to the
assumption that many of these recent management ideas are designed to create
confusion and internal chaos and are, perhaps, not relevant to some
organisations. Indeed each concept has often been marketed by those
consultants who are looking for ways to convince management that this
particular technique would work well in their company.
For example human resource management is likely to be more effective in
smaller companies where everyone has an understanding of each other's jobs,
but not, perhaps, in a large organisation with separate operating divisions
and business units. The 'just in time' (JIT) technique is effective where
there is a rapid and constant turnover in stock and where space is at a
premium, but not so relevant in a large manufacturing company where supplies
are needed on demand and where space is available. And performance-related
pay (PRP) will work in an organisation where there is a culture of
individualism and competition, but not where teamwork is an essential part
of the equation.
Likewise, the current fad of 'upward appraisals' is likely to work in the US
where individualism is the primary order and where there is a more casual
approach to the concept of management, accountability and responsibility. It
is unlikely to be accepted in the long-established and stratified societies
and cultures of Germany, France and the UK; it will definitely not work in
the structured and organised Japanese society.
Therefore, there can never be established global management theories and
practices simply because of the differences in culture and society.
Debate management theories by all means but the recommendation which might
come out of any discussion group is that companies should adapt or adopt
only those practices which meet the demands of their organisation; implement
techniques of likely benefit to the company; and condemn ineffective
practices to the waste paper basket.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Management can't replace thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headlines from the UK Treasury's Fundamental Review of Running Costs
were all about the loss of one in four in top personnel. But reducing the
size of the Treasury is not itself an important contribution to expenditure
control. It is a tiny department employing 1,400 people including clerical
staff other supporting workers. The review claims that it did not attempt to
make economies for their own sake, but rather asked whether a reformed and
slimmed down Treasury could do its job more efficiently.
There is a case to be made. The Treasury may be too hierarchical, and waste
time and energy in passing papers from one level to another. There may still
be too much candle-ends control of the expenditure of other departments in
place of priorities and ceilings.
Unfortunately the review does not say anything as straightforward. The
principal author, Jeremy Heywood, is no shrinking violet and one would
expect him to be direct and pungent. But something seems to happen to the
writing of people, whether journalists or officials, who venture into
management: they come under the grip of a woolly and obfuscatory jargon. The
authors remark that such few officials as the Treasury does have abroad are
mostly in America and they advocate a shift of emphasis towards Europe. More
knowledge of languages will thus be required. This is correct and applies
most of all to English. I would defy anyone who reads the full document of
more than 200 pages to come to any intelligent conclusion on whether the
proposed changes are for the better or the worse. The review has dozens of
acronyms in each chapter, and there is no glossary.
We have, of course, been here before. Similar reforms were advocated by the
Plowden Committee in 1961. As one Oxford commentator suggested, the Plowden
report must have gone through 'that lengthy process of redrafting, during
which the sharp edges, the pungent phrases and any handle to outside critics
were all removed'.
Like the present review, Plowden went on about the importance of management
and on the need for top officials to spend more time running their
departments instead of on the more glamorous job of advising ministers. The
review says that the ability to manage will be as important as the need to
analyse policy. (In a one-sentence lifeline, it grudgingly admits that there
will be a place for the analyst who cannot manage. Thank you, Jeremy.)
The most important point of substance in the two reports is identical: the
need for more delegation to the spending departments. There is, of course,
the opposite view that unless a senior department, such as the Treasury, and
a senior minister, such as the chancellor, get thoroughly involved in
departmental detail, they will be easy victims to spending lobbies and
pressure groups of all kinds. The outsider cannot judge. For the review
gives no examples of spending control. Nor does it even list the limits
below which departments can decide.
It comes as a breath of fresh air to find the odd sentence on events and
policies, for example that the sharp increase in the budget deficit in the
1990s took place because no one section of the Treasury was clearly
responsible for ensuring that 'the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement came
out on track'.
The review rejects the idea of downgrading economic forecasts and
contracting out the Treasury model. Here it is unconvincing. Finding
policies which are less dependent on crystal gazing ability is just as
demanding an intellectual task as making a forecast and a better use for
Treasury brainpower.
The chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, has overruled his officials by suggesting a
marketing of the Treasury forecasting work in a couple of years. But I
wonder if he realises that more than a normal commercial tender is involved.
The numerical estimates in the various macro models are adjusted to fit the
most fashionable theories and not the other way round - and necessarily so.
The review makes a brave attempt to distinguish between the Treasury mission
statement (to maintain a stable macro-economic environment) and the
'objectives' (permanently low inflation) which may characterise particular
governments. But the whole drift of the document is that economic policy
consists of pursuing low inflation, a balanced budget and efficient control
of public spending. I could not resist writing in the margin of my copy,
'signed Sir John Simon, 1939' (Sir John was the last British chancellor
unaffected by Keynes).
Simon may have been more right wing than his postwar successors. But what
many politicians and their businessmen friends will never learn is that such
matters are inherently contestable - there is no hard science in sight which
manager-politicians can tap if only they run a tight ship. One postwar
chancellor complained: 'Three Treasury knights have seen me and they have
all told me to do different things.' That is a more accurate presentation of
the state of knowledge than the managerialists would have us believe.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: The great fame drain - British cinema talent is being
colonised by a predatory Hollywood. But, argues Nigel Andrews, we should
simply lie back and enjoy it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
Colin Welland, waving that famous statuette, said 'the British are coming'.
But the Chariots Of Fire Oscar triumph was 15 years ago. More recently, the
British have indeed been coming, all over the movie landscape, but not quite
in the way envisaged by Welland.
A select committee of British MPs on a fact-finding visit last week to
Hollywood were reported to have been told by Steven Spielberg: 'There is no
British film industry.' Half a generation after our cinema thought it would
conquer the world by sitting tight and making home-bred history epics, we
have replaced a dominion movie culture with a diaspora movie culture. Many
British films, directors and actors now find themselves in the position of
being lucrative exports without any early life in a British factory or
warehouse.
Look at yesterday's key players. Richard Attenborough has returned to his
acting roots to make Jurassic Park and the forthcoming Christmas film
Miracle On 34th Street, after falling gently down the ladder of directorial
bankability from Cry Freedom to Shadowlands. And the Chariots
writer-producer duo of Colin Welland and David Puttnam have released a
humble childrens' comedy, The War Of The Buttons, with about as much Oscar
potential as an episode of Jackanory.
Meanwhile two of British cinema's one-time traitors and fugitives have
returned to become its all-hailed messiahs. The gone-Hollywood brothers
Ridley and Tony Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Top Gun, True Romance) have
bought Shepperton Studios, with the aim of turning it into an England-based
blast kiln for international cinema.
With luck this move - and its symbolic imprimatur for anti-nationalist
adventurism - will see the end of siege mentality cinema forever in this
country. By free movement in and out of other nations and cultures, British
cinema is creating a virtual new renaissance.
In many cases individual British movies and actors find that by going to
America first - followed by the rest of the world - they can make an
international impact almost before home audiences have heard of them. Four
Weddings And A Funeral, which opened in the US several weeks before its UK
release, has just become the most commercially successful British film of
all time. Why the jackpot? Because the film jumped straight into a foreign
market, rightly suspecting that selling itself to an outsiders' view of
Britain was better than selling itself direct to Britain herself.
If Weddings had opened first at home we might have dismissed it - knowing
our country too well - as a frothy piece of anyone-for-tennis comedy
romance. America and other countries, allowed a first glimpse, decided to
see it as quintessential Britain: as a mini-genre - the silly ass comedy -
gone mythic.
What director Mike Newell had done, much as Ridley and Tony Scott and other
Anglos had done to Hollywood's own action thrillers or sci-fi films, was to
raise the style stakes so that a little timeless archetypalism (even a
little post-modern preposterousness) upstaged or transcended the realism.
It is not just British films and directors, it is British actors that
America - and a world movie public following America - are now picking off
the remaindered shelves of British indifference.
For years Hugh Grant, formerly of Maurice (1987) and A Handful Of Dust
(1988), ranked nowhere as a movie presence. His comic potential was ignored
by most fellow Brits even in Bitter Moon, a highly promising trial run for
Four Weddings. In America, after Weddings opened, Grant's face launched a
thousand popularity polls and graced a dozen magazine covers. Once again
foreign eyes and ears had sensed a distilled and perfect 'Britishness' that
we were deaf and blind to.
It is part of a swelling tide of Anglophilia to which British cinema would
be foolish to play Canute, or to complain that we are 'selling out' to other
people's caricaturing vision of us.
Grant is rare only in being a nice chap in a British casting directory -
nay, an entire export industry - largely dominated by nasty chaps. Hollywood
comes to us for its villains. These have included Alan Rickman (Die Hard,
Robin Hood), Anthony Hopkins (Silence Of The Lambs), Jeremy Irons (Reversal
Of Fortune, The Lion King), Charles Dance (Last Action Hero) and Stuart
Wilson (No Escape), to name but the vanguard. (Actresses, nice or nasty,
export more slowly. But Emma Thompson is currently up there above-the-title
with Arnie, Danny De Vito and company.).
Why are the foreigners going for this new improved Brit pack? Partly because
our actors, theatre-honed, offer a performance panache increasingly
unavailable among American stars, who are either riddled with
late-generation Method tics (Hoffman, De Niro, Pacino) or branded with I for
Iconic Inanition (Schwarzenegger, Stallone).
But it may also be because Britain today is a uniquely placed buffer
culture. These pedigree toffs of ours, moving between suave villainy and
lovable silliness, belong to a country itself poised, in the dangerous days
of Gatt, between the moustache-twirlers of Europe and the honest folk back
in America.
In an age when the US is terrified of being left behind in the Great
Classiness Handicap, with Europe's countries banding together to cock a
high-culture snook at the new world, a love-hate romance is growing in
Hollywood with the one common-language country that US movies can recruit to
represent the old world's values for the new. Euro-awareness may also be why
Scorsese in The Age Of Innocence and Coppola in Dracula and Spielberg in
Schindler's List are increasingly turning to Euro-tinged subjects.
So while Hollywood seizes on British actors as special messengers of
erudition, elocution or patrician charm, audiences have flocked to Four
Weddings And A Funeral, believing there is a lost world out there, somewhere
near Europe, where fluffy, lovable, rambling human stories can happen:
stories that have no resemblance to America's own fast-food cinema of car
chases, cop action and ravening dinosaurs.
A decade and a half after we took 'Britishness' so seriously, after winning
that bunch of Oscars, that we thought the future lay in exporting UK
pageantry for ever and ever, we discover that the future for British cinema
 -its popular cinema at least - does not really lie with us at all. It lies
with those who better judge our charms and international selling-points and
have better equipment for marketing it. Our turn to be colonised and
exploited? If so, we should lie back and enjoy it.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: Notions about Orpheus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English Touring Opera has an established reputation for taking enterprising
stagings to opera-starved venues, but its current tour, which opened at the
Richmond Theatre on Wednesday, is saddled with a new production of Orpheus
and Eurydice that tries just too hard.
The special qualities of Gluck's opera appear to have eluded the inventive
producer Stephen Medcalf, who conjures up a series of ideas that detract
from the 'beautiful simplicity' the composer sought. Some of his images are
affecting: the opening, staged as Eurydice's funeral with Orpheus cradling
the urn containing his wife's ashes; and portraying the entrance to the
underworld as cardboard city, with dishevelled Furies sleeping rough and
guarding the boarded-up window that leads to Elysium, is a metaphor of some
potential.
But many of Medcalf's notions - is it all Orpheus's nightmare? is he a
ghost? - have not been developed. The ballet numbers cue 'meaningful' mime,
and the lovers' reunion is staged as a series of charades. The final
rejoicing calls forth toasts, party hats, streamers and cringe-making
choreography. At least Charles Edwards's black-and-white sets provide an
element of restraint.
Circumstances beyond the company's control - pit lights went out on the
orchestra twice - added to the unsettling feel of the evening, but Martin
Andre's musical direction was in itself uneasy. And from a company that
regularly commissions translations, it was worrying to hear how little of
Michael White's new version came across.
With 'authenticity' not a high priority, the casting of a counter-tenor
Orpheus was perhaps perverse when ETO could have had excellent mezzos cueing
up. Timothy Wilson's intonation was good, though his voice did not carry the
emotional weight Gluck's hero requires. Elizabeth Woollett, a strong soprano
with a feel for the style, made an apt heroine, but Helen Wold's Cupid was
compromised by the pixie-like characterisation imposed on her.
One reason for cherishing ETO is the opportunities it provides young
singers, and there was considerable talent on show in the revival of the
company's Boheme on Thursday. Leading the principals was Sarah Pring's
beautifully focused Mim and John Cogram's fresh sounding Rodolfo; Adrian
Clarke's secure Marcello, and Naomi Harvey a capricious Musetta whose entry
brought chaos to the Cafe Momus. Thomas de Mallet Burgess's production has
been tightened with profit and Andrew Greenwood conducts the reduced
orchestra with feeling and flair.
English Touring Opera's autumn season runs until December 3 (071 820 1141).

Some of the earliest jokes I can remember from radio comedies involve Siddi
Berrani, a north African town notable in the 1940s because it had featured
so large in the war between the Afrika Korps and the Eighth Army. Episode 8
in BBC2's repeat of The World At War tells of the struggle in the desert,
not only between Rommel and Montgomery, but against sandstorms, heat, flies,
thirst, and dysentery (7.00 BBC2). That is followed by White Heat, a series
about the development of technology which requires its audience to think a
bit; a novel and pleasant experience. Today's programme considers how
technology has been used to oppose 'Dirt And Disorder', from the Paris
cholera epidemic of 1832, which resulted in a new sewage system, to NASA's
voyage into space (8.00 BBC2). ITV shows the third and final part of its
current Cracker story in which Albie goes on the run and Fitz predicts a
killing spree. This latest contribution has enhanced Cracker's reputation
(9.00 ITV). In Age of Extremes Eric Hobsbawm talks about his new history of
the 20th century (11.30 BBC2).

FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: Rare Shostakovich - Opera in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard upon Tom Courtenay's heels in Moscow Stations comes Shostakovich's
musical comedy, which is also concerned with a Moscow suburb. Not in
Brezhnev's time, however, but in Krushchev's; and unlike Yerofeev's
dream-village Petushki, Cheryomushki is a real-life brute of a suburb, a
monstrous concrete estate. The mainspring of the comedy is that everybody is
trying desperately to get a flat there, because there is almost nowhere else
left around Moscow to go.
Though Shostakovich's piece had a fair Moscow success in 1959, this Pimlico
Opera production at the Lyric Hammersmith is its British premiere. I imagine
that it does it justice, but one should recognise the sea-changes that
Cheryomushki has undergone. It was designed for a standard Soviet theatre,
which meant a large orchestra and an established company with its own
comedians, etc.; it is delivered here by ten soloists (mostly young), an
eager, hard-working chorus of seven and a 14-strong band, on a strictly
limited budget.
With the colourful resources of a Soviet theatre, the time that Cheryomushki
takes might pass more quickly, but it would probably not be better. In fact
the story is quite lean: while four couples sort out their personal
difficulties, they are more passionately involved in hunting flats, or
hanging on to them. Most of that is farce. By the end, the right people win
and the others do not, especially not the corrupt bureaucrats. In Paul
Andrews' austere sets, Lucy Bailey stages the action energetically.
Shostakovich's music is the problem. Obviously his heart was not in it, for
the mostly short numbers are relentlessly bright, brittle and banal. A
little of that goes a long way; the whole of it goes on for three hours,
with no characteristic touches from the composer but the odd small harmonic
fracture. There are more and better tunes in his symphonies than in this
'musical'.
What attracted him to the project was presumably the chance of registering a
mild social protest for a popular audience, but it sounds as though he had
the most pessimistic expectations of their ears. Still, for historical
reasons it is interesting, and the keen Pimlico team do their collective nut
to infuse it with some comic life.

FT  24 OCT 94 / People: Europe's realistic banker - Alexandre Lamfalussy of
the European Monetary Institute explains his hopes for monetary union to
Peter Norman and Andrew Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
These are busy days for Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European
Monetary Institute. After 10 months squatting in buildings belonging to the
Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, the forerunner of the
planned European central bank is about to move to its new home in Frankfurt
and start working at full speed.
From the 35th floor of an office block re-christened the 'Eurotower',
Lamfalussy will preside over a staff of around 150, who will be charged with
making possible European monetary union according to the procedures laid
down by the Maastricht treaty.
It is a two-pronged task. The EMI's job is to make the preparations needed
for setting up the European System of Central Banks and, with that, a single
monetary policy and single currency, if and when the EU moves to the third
and final stage of Emu.
The institute also has to help prepare for Stage 3 by co-ordinating monetary
policy among the EU's 12 central banks and promoting the convergence of the
EU member states' economies on a path of sustained low inflationary growth
in the present Stage 2 of Emu.
Although the EMI is about 10 months behind schedule - thanks to prolonged
wrangling among European Union countries over its eventual site - Lamfalussy
is hopeful it will be able to achieve its goals.
Interviewed in his still-temporary headquarters in the BIS, he says: 'Things
are not as negative as they looked a year ago. Europe is enjoying a
broad-based, non-inflationary recovery. If this goes on for two to three
years it will create a climate which at least provides a framework for the
political decisions to move ahead.'
Like most Belgians, the 65-year-old Lamfalussy is a card-carrying Emu
enthusiast. In his previous capacity as BIS general manager, he was a member
of the Delors committee of central bankers that in the late 1980s plotted
the three-stage route march to monetary union, later adopted in the
Maastricht treaty.
But Lamfalussy is also a realist. Achieving Emu by 1997, the earliest
possible date envisaged in the Maastricht treaty, he says 'is not very
plausible' because it is difficult to imagine seven of the 12 EU member
states fulfilling the treaty's strict economic convergence criteria by then.
On the other hand, his belief is that there will eventually be a European
central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time.'
'The degree of internationalisation and integration of our economies is so
fast and the European single market is moving ahead so fast and is going so
deep, that so many vested interests will want stable exchange rates,' he
says.
His gut feeling, speaking as an economist, is that Britain will be unable to
stand aside from Emu. But whether the UK joins Emu is a matter of high
politics. The EMI has to focus on nitty-gritty matters and achieve agreement
on such technically difficult issues as the preparation of banknotes to be
used after the introduction of a single currency, as well as the drawing up
of common features of payments systems in the EU.
A potentially difficult issue is management of the single monetary policy.
The Bundesbank is actively promoting the notion that the proposed European
central bank should follow its example and set monetary policy according to
a money supply measure, while the Bank of England is promoting its more
eclectic approach of steering policy according to an inflation target.
Here, too, Lamfalussy is relatively sanguine. There is, he explains, 'no
cleavage in ideology' among the European central bank governors that make up
the EMI's council. All agree on the need for low inflation and the paramount
importance of governments reducing their fiscal deficits.
There may be different techniques of monetary management but there are also
similarities. The Bank of England, for example, looks at narrow and broad
money figures as part of its policy for controlling inflation.
Reconciling differences will be a big part of Lamfalussy's job at the EMI.
As president, he is both chief executive officer and chairman of the board.
His task will be 'to make sure things are going to happen,' driving the
technical committees - comprised of EMI staffers and national central bank
officials - so that they come with answers to problems.
He has been able to hand-pick his senior staff and has managed to avoid
placing people in posts according to national quotas.
Although Frankfurt-based, the institute's working language will be English.
But language will be the least of Lamfalussy's problems. He has perfected
his English since a spell as a research student at Nuffield College, Oxford,
in the 1950s. That was shortly after he fled to Belgium from Hungary at the
age of 20 to escape communism.
He was a bank economist and academic until the mid-1970s, when he became an
executive director and chairman of the Banque de Bruxelles. He joined the
BIS in 1976 and was general manager of the central bankers' bank from 1985
until the end of last year.
He can claim to be the inventor of the EMI because, as a member of the
Delors committee, he proposed that Europe's central banks should create a
joint subsidiary to advance the progress of Emu in Stage 2.
The job of running the institute is 'different from anything else I have
ever done before,' he says. He admits that he had more power as BIS general
manager because, as the man in charge of the central bankers' bank, he was
'living the markets' and had to take banking decisions.
It is the banking that he misses most: 'It was great fun, of great interest,
and it gave me, as an economist, a lot of feedback'.
On the other hand he believes he has much greater influence as head of the
EMI. 'I have a much more politically exposed profile, there is no doubt
about that. Even if you define the job in a narrow technical way, it still
has very deep political connotations.'
Then there is challenge of building a new institution. 'I have never built
an institution in my life. You can't imagine what it means to build up
something from scratch. It is a very, very full time job.
'I am trying to use the present relatively calm waters to make the
institution function, to build up its staff and working methods. If and when
a crisis breaks, we will see how I shall be able to handle it'.
Lamfalussy has been appointed for three years. At the moment he has no
intention of seeking to extend his term beyond 1996.
But given Europe's recent turbulent monetary history there is no guarantee
that he will avoid adding crisis management to his workload.

FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Fresh governor at Bank of Greece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Being governor of the Bank of Greece is hardly the world's most secure job.
Loukas Papademos, who took over last week, is the third central bank boss in
less than a year, writes Kerin Hope.
His two predecessors were both former economy ministers and political
appointees. Efthymios Christodoulou, the conservatives' choice, was sacked
last November by the incoming socialist government and has since returned to
the safety of the European parliament's back benches.
His replacement, Yannis Boutos, was a close political ally of Andreas
Papandreou, the socialist prime minister.
But Boutos made the mistake of annoying other top socialists, among them
Antonis Livanis, who does his best to ensure that Greece's state-controlled
banks put the government's interests first.
Boutos was keen to privatise Bank of Crete, kept under central bank
supervision since a Dollars 200m embezzlement scandal helped bring down
Papandreou's government in 1989. But the socialists thought it should stay
in the public sector. Boutos had to go.
Can Papademos stay the course rather longer? At 47, he is the youngest
central bank governor ever appointed. He also has the advantage of being a
technocrat, who taught economics at Columbia University in New York before
joining the Bank of Greece 10 years ago.
And as chairman of the EU deputy central bank governors' committee, he was
taken seriously in Brussels. He must be hoping his own government will
accord him the same status.

FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Japanese adviser for Camdessus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shigemitsu Sugisaki, a senior official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance
(MOF), has been named as special adviser to Michel Camdessus, the
International Monetary Fund's managing director, making him the most senior
Japanese national at the Washington DC-based organisation, writes Gerard
Baker.
His appointment follows the promotion of the previous special adviser,
Prabhakar Narvekar, to the position of deputy managing director in June.
At that time, the Fund's most senior management was expanded from one to
three deputy managing directors. A Japanese was not among the chosen three;
the other addition to the customary American being Alassane Ouattara, Ivory
Coast's former prime minister.
Sugisaki, 53, was most recently head of the secretariat at the Securities
and Exchange Surveillance Commission.
He joined MOF in 1964, working his passage through the international finance
and tax bureaus. He spent three years as assistant to the president of the
Asian Development Bank from 1976.
Since then he has seen a range of assignments at MOF, becoming deputy vice
minister of finance for international affairs in 1990 and deputy director
general of the international finance bureau a year later.
In a recent interview, Sugisaki said the IMF's role should be strengthened,
to achieve co-ordination on macroeconomic policy among leading
industrialised nations.
He also expressed doubts about the possibility of reforming the current
free-floating exchange-rate system. 'Nothing is more desirable than
realising stable exchange rates,' he said, 'but it is unrealistic to go back
to a fixed exchange-rate system.' Policy co-ordination was likely to be more
effective in stabilising currencies.
He is expected to hold the position for three years, as did his predecessor.

FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): New helmsman for Chicago's
Navistar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Navistar, the Chicago-based truck and engine maker, has teetered on the
brink of financial disaster more than once in the past decade, and each time
James Cotting, an intense man with a flair for finance, has brought the
company back, writes Laurie Morse.
The 61-year-old Cotting helped pull the company, once known as International
Harvester, out of Dollars 4bn in debt in 1981, and went on to oversee a
restructuring plan that saw the sale of the core agricultural machinery
line, and the Harvester name, to Tenneco in 1985.
More recently Cotting engineered a settlement to trim pension obligations
that had threatened to bankrupt the company.
Now, with the truck-making industry booming and Navistar on the verge of a
strong turnaround, Cotting is ready to hand over the chief executive's
reigns. Navistar's board has tapped John Horne, currently Navistar's chief
operating executive, to take over when Cotting retires in March next year.
While Cotting joined Navistar in 1979 as an outsider and quickly rose to the
top through the finance and planning ranks, the 56-year-old Horne is a
career company man who started with Navistar in 1966 as an engineer. He was
made head of Navistar's engine division in 1983, and became the company's
chief operating officer in 1991.
Although not faced with an immediate financial crisis, Horne's challenge
will be to bring Navistar's truck manufacturing group up to snuff with the
industry.
The division's profitability has lagged, in part because North American
demand for trucks has leaped so dramatically that Navistar has had trouble
sourcing required components for assembly.
'Jack Horne is an operating guy credited with making a success of Navistar's
diesel engine business,' says John McGinty, an analyst with CS First Boston.
'His challenge will be to move that success over to the truck side of the
business.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Now in glorious . . . - High-tech stirrings
in the world of cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The cluster of cinemas around Lincoln Center Plaza on the upper west side of
Manhattan has long been a mecca for New York film buffs, but next month it
will acquire an added attraction when Sony opens a complex of futuristic
cinemas.
The Lincoln Center cinemas will include 12 different theatres where
audiences will be able to choose from a wide range of movie technologies,
ranging from interactive films to high-definition movies and the gigantic
images of an IMAX screen.
Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company which became a force in the
film business five years ago by buying Columbia Pictures, sees the Lincoln
Center as an experiment to determine whether there really is a market for
high-tech alternatives to the two-dimensional film images that have for
decades been flashed across cinema screens.
Almost all the 'new' movie technologies on show at the Lincoln Center can
already be seen at theme parks, virtual reality arcades and independent
cinemas.
Yet Sony's initiative is one of the first significant investments by a major
entertainment group in innovative forms of cinema. The success or failure of
the Lincoln Center experiment is certain to influence the way that Sony -
and its competitors - show films to the public in future.
One of the ironies of the entertainment industry is that, despite the
mega-budgets and visual techno-tricks of modern Hollywood, movies have been
shot on almost the same type of 35mm plastic film (at a standard speed of 24
frames per second) since the invention of the talkies in the 1920s.
The last wave of experimentation came in the 1950s when the cinema faced the
first onslaught of competition from television. It was then that the
industry invested in innovations such as stereo sound, giant Cinerama images
that required the use of no fewer than three cameras, and Smell-O-Vision,
where the movie-going experience was 'enhanced' by appropriate scents pumped
into the cinema.
Stereo sound has survived into the 1990s, but Smell-O-Vision faded away
along with other short-lived 1950s crazes. The major Hollywood studios have
since reverted to traditional methods of movie-making, leaving
experimentation to a handful of techno-aware entrepreneurs.
George Lucas, director of Star Wars, and Doug Trumbull, a Hollywood special
effects expert who worked on 2001: ASpace Odyssey and Bladerunner, developed
different forms of 'motion simulation' cinema in the 1980s. Their techniques
enable the audience to experience the action of the movie because of the
speed at which the film was shot and the way the cinema seats move in
sequence with the plot. More recently, a pair of New York technology buffs,
Bob Bejan and Bill Franzblau, developed a method for making interactive
films whereby the viewer determines the course of the plot.
The main constraint on the development of these new technologies has been
shortage of product. It is extremely difficult - in some cases impossible -
to transfer movie footage shot by one method on to a different type of film.
As a result, most film-makers have played safe by sticking to traditional
35mm film, even if they have been tempted by the creative potential of the
new technologies. Similarly, cinema owners have been reluctant to equip
their theatres for showing new types of film because the choice of movies is
so limited.
Some new technologies have found a home in theme parks, notably George
Lucas's version of motion simulation which he devised for the Star Tours
ride at Walt Disney's Disneyland park in California. Others have been
restricted to specialist theatres such as IMAX, which significantly enlarges
the frame size by using 70mm film and is shown at a handful of
specially-equipped cinemas, including La Geode at the Parc de la Villette
science complex near Paris.
There are now signs that the market for more innovative types of film is
expanding. The level of audience interest has increased steadily in recent
years with the emergence of the new generation of young computer-literate
consumers who are accustomed to encountering technology in other leisure
interests, notably in theme parks or video games.
As a result, the old breed of techno-entrepreneurs have been able to expand
their activities. Showscan, the Los Angeles company which owns the rights to
Doug Trumbull's motion simulation films, now has 10 theatres in North
America. It opened its first one in Europe this summer (after years of
licensing its concept to European cinema owners) at the Trocadero in London,
and is now considering plans to open other theatres in Europe.
Meanwhile, the convergence of the film industry with other sectors such as
leisure and electronics means that the new generation of entertainment
groups has a vested interest in experimenting with high-tech methods of
movie-making for use in their theme parks and theatres.
Disney has invested heavily in new technology to develop concepts for its
parks. Time Warner is following suit, as is Sony, which recently set up a
new subsidiary, Sony Retail Entertainment, to launch a series of theme
parks, or entertainment centres, as showcases for all its products,
including techno-toys, music and movies.
The opening of Sony's new Lincoln Center cinema complex forms part of that
strategy. Sony's research teams have been working in the cinema field, and
plan early next year to screen at Lincoln Center a high-definition movie
that they have adapted from 35mm film. Sony is also liaising with
independents in the movie technology field, notably with Interfilm, the
interactive film-making company founded by Bob Bejan and Bill Franzblau,
with which it has negotiated a production deal.
'We're still at an early stage in this field', said Peter Newcombe of Sony
in New York. 'We're not sure how the audience will react to our new theatres
at the Lincoln Center. But if it's a smash, we'll certainly consider opening
more of them.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: CD-Rom move at Anglia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAI Broadcasting, owner of two ITV companies, Meridian Broadcasting and
Anglia Television, is planning a significant move into the new media and
hopes to be a large publisher of CD-Roms by next year.
Anglia Multimedia has already produced two CD-Roms - one on British castles
and the other The Human Body, which has been licenced to Encyclopaedia
Britannica for sale in the US. Anglia is now planning to produce 13 titles
by the end of the year, mainly for the educational market. and will move
into the consumer market next year. By then the ITV company, famous for
nature series such as Survival, hopes to be producing between 18 and 24
CD-Roms a year.
'We are concentrating on the creative and rights side. We don't want to bet
on any particular hardware architecture,' says Ajay Chowdhury, director of
new media at MAI Broadcasting. The initiative is being backed by Lord
Hollick, the MAI chief executive, who has installed a CD-Rom computer in his
office.
Anglia, which is believed to be the first ITV company directly to produce
CD-Roms, is planning titles in co-operation with English Heritage, the
National Maritime Museum and other organisations. It also plans to exploit
its own programme library to produce CD-Roms on nature, using the Survival
catalogue.
Peter Stibbons, an Anglia media development executive, believes the TV
background is vital in producing CD-Roms, for both education and the
consumer market. Apart from exploiting the programme library, Anglia is now
looking at CD-Rom potential when producing new programmes, so that any
additional material can be shot at the same time. Anglia is also involved in
producing interactive 'real time' cartoons for TV, in particular a cartoon
character called Ratz, whose behaviour can be influenced by children calling
in to the programme.
Perhaps the most potentially dramatic Anglia initiative, however, is as part
of an experiment which has already begun on Cambridge Cable in Anglia's
transmission area. This project involves offering a wide range of on-demand
services, including home shopping and banking, and allowing viewers to chose
the time they want to watch the evenings scheduled programmes.
The consortium, which includes Anglia, Online Media, a subsidiary of Acorn
Computers and ATM, providers of the video servers which deliver programming,
is already available to 10 cable subscribers. The number will be increased
to 250 next year.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Boost for US ethnic TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A newscast spotlights international events in Japanese. On another channel,
a steamy love affair is taking place in Spanish. US television is turning
into a smorgasbord of ethnic programming. In many urban centres, where new
immigrants tend to congregate, the number of foreign-language channels is
already staggering. And, with fibre optics about to boost the number of
channels available, viewers can expect to see even more in future.
New nation-wide distribution channels for cable, through computers or
telephone lines, and pay-per-view services, should also help boost
US-produced ethnic programming.
Some of the Spanish stations already produce 50 per cent or more of their
programmes for the American market, but most ethnic stations rely on
purchases of shows from abroad.
Many immigrants and minorities view ethnic stations as an affirmation of
their importance in US society, and the surge in the number of immigrants in
the US guarantees an expanding audience for many ethnic shows. In Boston,
the cable station Celtic Vision hopes to launch soon with programmes
catering to a large community of Irish and Irish descendants, estimated at
1.6m in Massachusetts alone. 'Potentially, we have a bigger audience in the
US than in Ireland,' says Robert Matthews, chairman of Celtic Vision.
But the role of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in encouraging
more ethnic programming on cable remains uncertain. For instance, the
commission may try to increase access for smaller companies - which include
many of the ethnic stations - by creating 'must carry' rules for alternative
programming.
'We've already sponsored a number of initiatives over the years that have
allowed for more ethnic programmes', says Karl Kensinger, special assistant
to the chief of the mass media bureau at the FCC.
The increase in ethnic programming will not only reflect American society,
but help to shape it. On the negative side, however, easy access to
foreign-language shows may hold back immigrants' progress in learning
English, and niche programming may increase the distance between different
cultural groups.
TV once represented the lowest common denominator for US society, and vastly
diverse viewers tuned in for a single show, such as I Love Lucy, in the
1950s. Now, two Americans can watch television all week and never see the
same programme.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Architecture: How to commission a good new building - Colin
Amery describes what makes an FT Award winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Good architecture is fundamental to good business. This simple fact ought to
be obvious, but it is still one of the more difficult tasks in life
convincing the directors of a company that spending money on a good building
will have benefits that are economically significant. To put it at its most
stark: how can you quantify the benefits of employing a well-qualified
architect?
For nearly 30 years this newspaper has campaigned through its architecture
award for a higher standard of design in the workplace, and that campaign
has been successful. When the Financial Times Industrial Architecture Award
began, it had a specific task in the post-war world - to move industry out
of the satanic mills and into the white light of the second half of the 20th
century. As the years have passed and we approach the millennium, the
possibilities for architecture and for the world of work have changed
completely.
The Financial Times Architecture Award, for which applications are now
invited, has become more broadly based, and is looking for the highest
quality of architecture in a major new building. Recent years have shown
that buildings as different as airports and libraries can win the FT award.
The judges are looking for those qualities which make a work of architecture
both distinguished and practical.
There is not as much mystery about the award's criteria as some architects
like to think. The jury is looking beyond style to lasting qualities of
elegance and efficiency. Although the jury includes two distinguished
architects, there is always a third and important member who is a layman.
He is not exactly the man in the street, but he is a prominent businessman
with the practical knowledge of commissioning buildings. As I have seen over
the years, the layman plays an essential role in helping penetrate the
arcane world of architectural fashion and discovering how practical and
efficient a new building is.
It may not be realised quite how the FT award works. Applications are sought
not only from architects but from the commissioners of buildings and those
who use them. Owners of new buildings, the contractors who have built them,
engineers and surveyors can all nominate a building as a candidate for the
award.
What is taken especially seriously is an entry from a daily user of the
premises. When the jury visits a building - unlike some awards, which are
often judged purely from glamorous photographs, the FT jury visits every
short-listed entry - the building's architect is not allowed to be present.
The jury gets the whole story from the client and the users. It is not an
uncommon sight to see the lay-judge lagging behind the chairman of the
company's party, having a heart-to-heart chat with an employee who had
problems with the office lighting, or is complaining about a lack of
privacy, or about the building's hierarchical arrangements.
This year, with the easing of the recession, we expect a strong entry of
buildings that have been finished since August 1993. But with the cooling of
the building boom of the last few years, I have suggested a certain
flexibility in the time-frame for entries: some may have been completed for
a little more than the last two years.
The 1993 competition showed clearly the widening of the award and also the
interesting problem facing the judges in finding real architectural
originality and quality, while ensuring that the building worked. The winner
was the Queen's Stand at Epsom racecourse, designed by Richard Horden.
It is very much a place of work, and the judges were as interested in the
quarters for the jockeys as they were in the architectural tour de force of
the public areas. An important consideration was the relationship of the new
stand to the glorious landscape of the Epsom Downs. In this regard the
building scored very well, proving that a bold statement can complement a
naturally beautiful location.
The range of last year's commended schemes was also impressive, showing that
there is a lot of good new architecture in Britain if you take the trouble
to find it. The new airport at Stansted ran the winner very closely. Indeed,
the work of Sir Norman Foster was included twice last year, both at Stansted
and at his elegant and economical library at Cranfield management college.
This marvellous small building showed that the employment of a distinguished
leader of the architectural profession need not cost the client an arm and a
leg, for the library was built within the tightest of educational budgets.
The refurbishment of buildings also qualifies for the award, and Michael
Hopkins' work on the old Bracken House, near St Paul's Cathedral - once the
home of the FT and now of a Japanese bank - demonstrated how amazing new
life can be brought to older office buildings.
Entry forms for this year's award are available from the Corporate
Communications Department, Financial Times, Number One Southwark Bridge,
London SE1 9HL. The closing date is the end of December. Judging takes place
next spring.

United Airlines says it plans to suspend services between London and Seattle
next April, adding that the route was the weakest it obtained when it bought
the London operations of now-defunct Pan American World Airways.
The move will leave British Airways as the only carrier offering a scheduled
non-stop service between the cities. BA flies daily to Seattle year-round.
United has been frustrated in its effort to fly non-stop between Chicago and
London, and plans to keep pushing for clearance.

<TEXT>
London City Airport claims that passengers using its services can achieve
big time savings on London-Paris and London-Brussels trips compared with
existing air connections via Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, or with the new
Eurostar rail service via the Channel Tunnel, writes Michael Thompson-Noel.
Its claims are based on published travel data. London City Airport claims a
journey time to Brussels of 2 hours 25 minutes against 4 hours by
Eurostar; and of 2 hours 45 minutes to Paris against Eurostar's 3 hours 45
minutes.
Last week, two Eurostar trains broke down. One replacement train raced from
Waterloo to Gare du Nord in a record 2 hours 50 minutes. This was 10 minutes
quicker than the Eurostar journey time for Waterloo-Gare du Nord cited by
London City Airport in its own promotions.
Initially, tickets for the Eurostar service, which go on sale today, will
start at a basic Pounds 95 (pre-booked) from London to Paris or Brussels
return. Eurostar's official starting date is November 14.

<TEXT>
Alitalia warned last week that fog could disrupt travel to and from Milan's
Linate airport this winter more than usual, writes Andrew Hill.
The airport has replaced its out-dated instrument landing system (ILS),
which allows aircraft to land when visibility is as poor as 100m. But such
landings will only be possible next winter (1995-96), when testing of the
new equipment is complete. Until then, if visibility drops below 200m,
airlines will have to use other airports, such as Malpensa (Milan's second
airport) or Bergamo, or cancel flights. Last winter was unusually clear, but
fog patches are already causing problems for drivers in the Milan area.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Tradecraft of the frequent flyer - Michael
Holman instructs a friend in the art of getting on an overbooked aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Were it not for me, Tubby Fanshawe might to this day be languishing in
Lagos, the victim of an overbooked flight.
Tubby, an accountant on a three-year posting to Nigeria, had joined me at
the check-in queue for the British Airways flight out of Lagos, the
modern-day equivalent of being evacuated from Dunkirk. As Tubby banged on
about this and that, I snapped. 'Tubby,' I said, 'I cannot talk, I'm
concentrating.'
'What on earth do you mean?' he asked. I told him that the explanation would
have to wait until we were on the aircraft. An hour later, gin-and-tonic in
hand, I introduced Tubby to the tradecraft of the serious traveller.
The wiles and ruses cover everything from getting upgraded and cheap tickets
to keeping the adjoining seat vacant. But the six-hour flight to London
allowed time for only one subject, perhaps the most important skill of all:
securing a seat on an overbooked flight.
Tubby had broken all the rules, and it had taken all my cunning to get him
on the flight. 'Let me ask you a couple of questions,' I said, in between
mouthfuls of those tasty, coated peanuts that make BA's club-class service
so enjoyable. 'When you were standing in the queue distracting me, did you
notice that chappie lurking near the desk?'
Tubby nodded: 'The bod who looked like a cross between a maitre d' and a
Heathrow baggage handler?'
'Right,' I said. 'And what's his job?'
'Haven't a clue.'
'BA station manager,' I told him. 'Did anything strike you about the chap
who checked you in?'
'No,' said Tubby. 'Frankly all BA staff look the same to me.'
'He was the one you got shirty with at the city office. You hit the roof
when he told you your name was not on the passenger list.'
Tubby looked thoughtful. 'I wondered why you were so oily with him -
commiserating about the difficult conditions they had to work under, power
cuts and all that.'
He drank deeply of his G&amp;T. 'Certainly helped at the check-in desk,' he
admitted, adding: 'I expect my membership of BA's frequent-flyer club helped
get me on the flight. That must count for something if the aircraft is
full.'
'Certainly does,' I said. 'I noticed you have a blue card. Very
embarrassing. Lowest in the pecking order. Deduct one point. Far better to
play the experienced maverick who scorns Air Miles - score one point. Silver
card, now that's a very different matter. Add two points. As for gold-card
holders, they've nothing to worry about.'
I warmed to my theme. 'You had luggage to check in. Deduct two points. And
while we are on the subject, your performance at the hotel check-out counter
this morning didn't help.'
Tubby defended himself vigorously. 'That chap in front of me was taking
ages.'
I sympathised. 'Sure as eggs, Tubby, the chap in front of you who is taking
an interminable time examining his hotel bill is a member of the cabin crew.
One of life's mysteries. But it did not go down well with Captain Tyrell
when you asked him to get a move on because you had a flight to catch.'
'How did you know who it was?' asked Tubby.
'Asked the clerk,' I told him. 'It's another card you can play. 'Is Ken
Tyrell the captain on tonight's flight?' you inquire casually at the
check-in counter. They cannot be certain, but you have introduced the
possibility that you know the captain. You're less likely to be bumped off
the flight list.'
Tubby was getting cross. 'At least I had a book to read in the queue.'
'Mark of the amateur,' I countered. 'You miss the tell-tale signs of an
overbooked flight. Body language changes, tense whispers into the mobile
phones . . . seconds can count.'
'But when word got out, and they formed a scrum round the desk, you told me
to sit tight.'
'I'd read the signs, Tubby. While you were engrossed in that pulp novel, I
was chatting to the station manager.'
'What about?'
'I was asking if first class was full. I had my credit card in my hand, thus
making it clear I was expecting to pay and not some cheapskate seeking an
upgrade.'
'But what if there were first-class seats available?' asked Tubby.
'I knew it was chock-a-block, thanks to a precautionary phone call to BA
reservations this morning. But it's not the first-class seat I'm after. I
want to establish myself as a serious traveller. I ask the station manager
to put me on the wait list, and it's an excuse to give him my card.'
Tubby suddenly remembered something. 'But I saw you reading a paperback
later]' he said.
'Paperback, yes. Novel, no. Contingency planning. I was consulting my
Official Airline Guide. Never travel without it. Gives all direct scheduled
flights within Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Just in case, I booked us
on this evening's flight to Addis, with connecting flight to London. Got the
last two seats.'
Tubby was getting ratty. 'At least I dressed sensibly for the flight,' he
said, his lurid track-suit outfit comfortably accommodating his paunch.
'Lightweight suit and tie for me,' I told him. 'Better chance of being
upgraded.' Tubby's eyes lit up.
'Tell me how . . .' The timing was perfect. 'Mr Holman?' said the steward.
'Would you care to move to the front of the plane?'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Elegance and energy - Smart Guide / Mexico
City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
What is the best part of town to stay in?
Well-heeled business travellers head for Polanco, the most exclusive and
expensive part of town, or the Zona Rosa (Pink Zone), which is more
down-market but livelier. The two are only five minutes apart, and fast
becoming one. At all costs avoid the south of the city, which is up to an
hour from the business district.
Polanco is fashionable partly because it bears little resemblance to the
rest of Mexico. The main street, Masaryk, has been renamed Rodeo Drive, and
boasts numerous posh shops. Polanco is home to the best hotels and many fine
restaurants, and is close to everything important. The Zona Rosa includes
the stock market, most of Mexico's brokers, and plenty of nightclubs.
Hotels?
For years, foreign businessmen stayed at the Camino Real (Dollars 200 a
night) in Polanco, tolerating its poor service and a 10-minute walk to their
rooms in return for stunning architecture and large spaces. But that was
before the Four Seasons.
The Four Seasons (Dollars 225) in the Zona Rosa opened earlier this year,
and is booked weeks in advance. A few hours spent at the front desk will
tell you who is in town, and a few more at the bar will tell you what they
are doing.
If you cannot get in, the boring but efficient Presidente Intercontinental
(Dollars 250) and Nikko (Dollars 210), both in Polanco, are popular. For the
adventurous, the penthouse suite or a high-up double room at the Ritz
(Dollars 75) in the historical centre offers splendid views.
What about restaurants?
The most elegant and expensive are Champs Elysees in the Zona Rosa and
Fouquet's at the Camino Real, where you could be in Paris, except that the
customers are generally Mexican politicians. Many businessmen prefer the
glitzy La Galvia in Polanco, with its nouvelle Mexican food.
Pomodora, opposite the stock exchange, offers the city's best Italian food.
The current hit restaurant is Polanco-based Los Alcatraces (Mexican cuisine)
where lunch lasts for three hours or more. Try to book days in advance, but
even then you may not get in.
Foreigners like Cicero Centenario in the historical centre: Mexican food and
mariachi music in a converted brothel that has little ventilation.
Is there much entertainment?
Mexicans have such long lunches that they generally rest in the evenings. A
must for the first-time visitor is Garibaldi Square, where you can be
serenaded by mariachi bands while drinking tequila. The Salon Mexico is the
hot place to dance, and the trendiest bars are La Tirana and Bar Milagro.
The even hipper Barba Azul in the Colonia Obrera is recommended for those
willing to take off their business suits.
The most suitable places for a working drink are the hotels: Camino Real or
Four Seasons.
What are the local quirks?
Mexicans take their time over business, and do not look kindly on people in
a hurry. Many like to be friendly with those they are working with, so do
not try to pack too much into a day.
Mexicans often keep unpredictable hours: some work from 8.30am to 6pm,
others from 10am to 9pm. Some never take long lunches, others always seem
to. Be flexible, and expect appointments to be rearranged at the last
moment.
How do I get around?
Taxis are plentiful, but drivers often know less about the city than a
businessmen who has spent three days in it. Use hotel cars or bring a map so
you can direct the driver.
What if I have a spare day?
The seriously minded would spend it in the national archaeology museum,
having done some homework first. If you want to be outdoors, the pyramids at
Teotihuacan are the usual first stop. Or you can visit the local Indian
market at Tepoztlan (an hour away), climb the volcanic mountain and take a
margarita at the fashionable Ciruelo restaurant.

Slim pickings in the cinema this week. Major League II provides a sedative
for stressed-out late-year audiences, while Albert Finney slogs through an
American-backed film of Terence Rattigan's The Browning Version. Though
directed by Britain's Mike Figgis, this tale of an unloved schoolmaster
becomes a wasteland of blitzed credibility with a few small fragments of
human pathos. Watch for the howlers in the cricket match, and quail at the
just-for-Yank-audiences presence of Matthew Modine as second-lead
schoolteacher.
Better to settle in with the week's new videos. Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven
is the deconstructed cowboy masterpiece that won its star-director a hatful
of Oscars. Violent but powerful. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the
famous Disney animation feature - fresh as paint after 57 years - about a
girl held hostage by extremist mineworkers. And Victor Sjostrom's The
Phantom Carriage (1920) and Benjamin Christensen's Haxan (1922) are two
marvellous Scandinavian rarities - about ghosts and witches respectively -
unearthed by the sex-and-horror video label Redemption, as if to atone for
the tripe they usually turn out.
At the ICA let me fanfare a season of Korean cinema. This lasts throughout
this week and brings another revelation from the enterprise peninsula. The
Koreans already make all our TVs, teapots and tennis shoes: now they are
turning out high-style comedies and costume dramas. Look out especially for
Soponye and Mandala, both by the veteran director Im Kwon-Taek.
It is probably time for you to book for the London Film Festival. Following
hard on Halloween, this opens on November 3 with Kenneth Branagh's
Frankenstein (Robert De Niro as the monster) and then becomes the usual
heady mixture of trick-and-treat.
More about the treats in next Thursday's film column. As for the tricks,
keep a pinch of salt handy when you read the brochure's hyperbolised
write-ups. Can 200 films all be good? Floreeat festa, but caveat emptor. The
LFF, based at London's National Film Theatre, is open to all. Inquiries,

FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: Man with the millions - Sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have you just played badminton in a hall with a leaky roof? Swum over the
weekend in a pool that could do with the boiler turned up a notch or two?
Then write to Rodney Walker, the man who needs your help in giving away
several million pounds a week to sport's good causes.
After decades of being strapped for cash, British sport will soon be awash
with the stuff, courtesy of the new national lottery, which starts next
month. According to Walker, newly appointed to the role of sport's Santa
Claus, the most conservative revenue forecasts will provide him with Pounds
100m in the first year, rising to a minimum of Pounds 250m in 1997.
This sort of money represents a four-to-fivefold increase on current
spending by the Sports Council, where Walker is both the new chairman and
new broom.
Anyone who has sat on a charity or trust and tried to give money away will
know how hard it can be. Often there are too few applicants, and the body
handing out the cash is not sufficiently well organised to go out and find
suitable recipients. Or the claimants that do step forward are pushy, noisy
and ill-deserving.
Walker is under no illusions about his task. 'Giving it away effectively and
hitting the target consistently is going to be difficult. It's an onerous
responsibility', he said from the office of the construction business he
founded in Wakefield, Yorkshire.
His previous biggest job in sport was chairing the Rugby League, a role he
came to via the boardroom of Wakefield Trinity, the local professional club.
In chatting to Walker it seemed both essential and tactless to point out
that the Sports Council has become a byword for profligate bureaucracy.
Indeed, rigorous analysis of the malaise in many British sports would
conclude that the Sports Council is part of the problem, rather than the
answer. Luckily, its new chairman is temperamentally inclined to vigorous
cutting and pruning, an approach discreetly backed by sports minister Ian
Sproat.
However, the new boss has to square a difficult circle. He cannot start
handing out big sums with the help only of a secretary and an answerphone.
His own guess is that he'll need around 100 people spread across the country
to scrutinise applications for money, which are already flooding in at a
rate that could reach 30,000 a year.
'I'm committed to reducing bureaucracy at the Sports Council, so in a sense
it's a wonderful opportunity to transfer people across to the lottery unit
and give them something worthwhile to do,' he told me.
Whitehall's guidelines for lottery proceeds stipulate that grants be made
for capital projects rather than current spending. At first glance this
seems understandable, even laudable. On reflection, however, I have huge
doubts about its wisdom.
After all, a running track or a sports hall sounds tangible and reassuring -
money well spent. But many elite sports are short of day-to-day cash. When
the British rowing crews did so well at the world championships in the US
recently, the oarsmen had to spend around Pounds 800 each on air fares to
Indianapolis, causing considerable individual hardship.
A new boat-house at Putney or another racing shell is almost the last thing
they need. Walker is sympathetic, but says that his team must accumulate
respectability and credibility with the brief they have been handed before
they can start re-writing the rules.
'As the government's confidence in the operation grows, I'm sure they'll be
able to give us more discretion,' he predicted. Initially, his biggest
concern is to ensure that organisations qualifying for large capital grants
will have enough income to run their new assets.
'I don't want to put Pounds 2m into a wonderful new facility and then find
we've been pouring money into a black hole that's got no chance of becoming
self-funding in future,' he says.
This has been a problem with some of the projects funded by the Foundation
for Sports and the Arts, the charity set up to recycle about Pounds 40m a
year from the promoters of commercial football pools.
For example, three years ago the FSA handed over Pounds 1m to a group
planning a racing yacht for the 1994 Whitbread round-the-world race. Dolphin
&amp; Youth was duly built, but was desperately strapped for operating cash as
the race progressed. Today, there is little money to maintain her, but the
terms of the gift preclude a sale.
'There have been disappointments for the FSA, but I applaud what they've
achieved,' says Walker cautiously. His own game-plan seems to be two-fold.
First, to lean towards commercially viable projects capable of creating
their own revenue base. Community swimming pools would be a classic example.
Second, to create income-producing 'endowments' that will accompany major
grants of a type that might otherwise take years to become self-supporting.
This has echoes of the National Trust. For years this most ruthlessly
efficient of British charities has refused gifts of land or houses unless
accompanied by an endowment sufficient to cover running costs. In this way
it has avoided the financial swamps and opprobrium it would have attracted
if it had accepted roof-less country mansions or neglected woodlands.
Walker's other line of thought is to encourage applications from commercial
providers of sports facilities. It may take a little swallowing for the
traditional sports bureaucracy to see quasi-public sector money going to
those who build marinas or golf courses for profit. But he does not
hesitate. He knows he has no alternative if he is to hand out that mountain
of cash 'effectively'.
'Personally I have no trouble recommending giving the money to a successful
commercial enterprise,' he says. 'I'm a great believer in rewarding success
and effort, wherever you find it.'

The greatest hits from the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, performed by
original artists, are brought together for the first time in The Very Best
of Andrew Lloyd Webber (Polydor). The phenomenally successful British
composer - he once had six shows running simultaneously in London's West End
 -tends to divide people into extreme camps, but here at least is a
collection of highly memorable tunes, sung by a variety of mega-stars which
includes Jose Carreras, Glenn Close, Barbra Streisand and Sarah Brightman.
Mary-Chapin Carpenter is one of the more literate of the new wave of
singer-songwriters who, just a few years ago, were in danger of becoming
extinct. Stones in the Road (Columbia) will no doubt repeat the commercial
success of her recent recordings, relying as it does on a similar mix of
strong, country-based material and deft arrangements - Branford Marsalis
makes a cameo appearance on soprano saxophone for 'John Doe No. 24', one of
the album's strongest tracks. Carpenter also makes an appearance on Red, Hot
&amp; Country (Mercury), that genre's contribution to Aids awareness, which
follows the successes of Red Hot &amp; Blue and Red, Hot &amp; Dance. The
compilation of classic tracks also includes Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash.
One of Handel's neglected operas, Poro, Re dell'Indie, first performed in
London in 1731, receives a world premiere recording on the Opus 111 label.
Fabio Biondi conducts the young Europa Galante ensemble.
Michael Nyman, still riding high on the success of his soundtrack for The
Piano, releases his first live album, Live (Venture), a collection of his
most popular material which also includes his scores for The Draughtsman's
Contract and Making a Splash.
Themed classical compilation albums get ever sillier: Classical Ecstasy:
Exploring the Tingle Factor (BMG) is a collection of pieces chosen by
readers of Classic CD for their ability to send shivers up the spine. They
are amusingly sub-divided into 'lump-in-the-throat', 'goose bumps' and
'beating heart' categories; the pieces of music (by Wagner, Barber, Bizet,
et al) are largely predictable. Wackier still is Classical (Real World) by
the Terem Quartet - yet more familiar pieces, but this time played on
Russian folk instruments. If you fancy the idea of Eine Kleine Nacht Musik
on balalaika, domra and accordion, this is for you.

Bouncers were bowled at England cricket captain Mike Atherton as soon as the
team landed in Perth, where the first match of the tour will be played
tomorrow. This time the fast balls came from the Australian press and the
hot topic was sledging - players verbally abusing opponents at the crease.
Atherton was questioned fiercely about a statement he is alleged to have
made after the last Ashes series in 1993. 'The one who really got up my nose
was Steve Waugh,' Atherton is said to have said. 'He spent the entire series
giving out verbals - a bit of a joke really as he was the one bloke on
either side who was wetting himself against the quick bowlers.'
Atherton now claims he cannot remember making the comments, but the issue
highlights two things that will determine England's success in the coming
Ashes battle: team spirit (sledging or no sledging) and fast bowling.
'Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Lillee doesn't get you, Thomson must.'
That was a chant that turned many an England supporter's blood to ice, and
it has been traditional that the side with the best fast bowlers wins Test
series in Australia.
Atherton will be hoping that the tradition is maintained, because this time
round it is England that have the stronger pace attack. However, Devon
Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas, Darren Gough, Martin McCague and Joey Benjamin
will need to be at their best, for Australia seem to be stronger in every
other department, including team character.
Firing up the troops to take on the ancient enemy has never been an
Australian problem. As Graham Gooch lamented last year: 'Our spirit is
nothing like their's' Atherton will be aware that developing the team's
character will be as important as his other duties if he is to interrupt one
of the worst spells - for England - since James Lilleywhite first led an
England touring side to Australia in 1877. The last three Ashes series have
finished 4-0, 3-0 and 4-1 in Australia's favour.

FT  24 OCT 94 / This Week: FT guide to curbing the car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Wednesday the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution publishes its
report on the environmental impact of Britain's traffic. What can the
motorist expect?
The commission, a 16-strong team of scientists and environmental experts,
will be making more than 100 recommendations. These will include a sharp
rise in fuel duties, improvements in car technology to reduce exhaust
emissions, and targets for air pollution, noise and the reduction of
accidents. Although higher taxes are one of the areas on which the
commission will concentrate, there are limits because of the impact of
increased costs on the road haulage industry and ultimately the economy.
Rural dwellers would also be severely disadvantaged.
What has prompted this?
The apparently unstoppable growth in car ownership. Car numbers rose from 2m
in 1952 to 20m in 1992, and official studies forecast an increase of between
83 per cent and 142 per cent in car ownership by 2025. Cars accounted for 57
per cent of all journeys in 1989-91, up from 48 per cent in 1985-86.
Is the car really so damaging to the environment?
Evidence has been accumulating in recent years that car emissions are
harmful to health. Leaded petrol has been identified as adversely affecting
the IQ of children and there are now suggestions that car exhausts are
behind the increased incidence of asthma. Vehicle emissions frequently push
air pollution levels above World Health Organisation and European Union
guidelines in some parts of Britain. Individual pollutants, such as ozone,
nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, are of great concern,
but there are worries that taken together they create a 'cocktail effect'
which is not yet fully understood. Apart from air pollution, cars cause
noise, vibration and accidents while the roads needed to accommodate car use
eat up large tracts of countryside. Motorists' organisations complain the
car driver is already heavily taxed, but some estimates put the cost of
pollution and accidents at between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a year.
What is the government doing about this?
It is gradually moving towards a more environmentally friendly transport
policy, though its critics say there is still a long way to go. For example,
last March it dropped or froze one-third of the 371 roads schemes pencilled
in for completion over the next 10 years. Very few completely new roads will
be built but existing ones will be widened and the by-pass programme will
continue. The emphasis is now moving to managing the existing road network
more effectively by means of in-car systems which provide advice on
route-planning and avoiding congestion, and by more informative road signs
linked to traffic control centres. An ambitious programme to install
electronic tolls on Britain's 1,900-mile motorway network is under way for
completion in 1998. Cynics say these moves have as much to do with reducing
government spending as with improving the environment.
Why is the government paying more attention to the environmental arguments?
Partly because of a growing body of evidence from research and partly
because political pressures are increasing. The government committed itself
to working out an environmental policy at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and
the results are now coming through. A broad coalition has been formed
against the car and roads. This includes not just organisations such as
Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace but also the National Trust, the Council
for the Protection of Rural England and professional bodies such as the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. Conservative MPs whose
constituencies lie in the path of road schemes are under pressure from their
voters.
So why does the government still spend Pounds 2bn a year on its roads
programme - 60 per cent of its transport budget?
Although people want to reduce car use generally, they still cling
stubbornly to using their own cars because it provides convenience, safety
and prestige. Company cars account for more than half of all cars sold in
the UK, encouraging employees to drive rather than use the train. Meanwhile,
89 per cent of freight tonnage is moved by road.
Couldn't drivers be persuaded to switch to more environmentally friendly
means of transport, such as trains, buses or bicycles?
Public transport is expensive by international standards, while low levels
of spending mean it is often unattractive, inefficient or inappropriate to
today's needs. A six-mile commuter trip in London costs Pounds 15.65p,
compared with Pounds 12.24p in Berlin, Pounds 8.80p in Paris and a European
average of Pounds 8.11p. Spending on railway infrastructure in Britain is
just over Pounds 5 per head of population, compared with Pounds 48 in Sweden
and Pounds 29 in the Netherlands. The cyclist is poorly provided for in most
cities.

The battle of the the sexes is likely to be fought out on sofas across
Britain as Panorama (Monday, 9.30-10.10pm, BBC1) takes on the masculinist
backlash and asks why boys are so badly done by? Girls now do better than
boys at every level of education, and women are out-smarting men in the
boardroom and beating them to some of the best jobs. The reason, according
to this programme, is an inbuilt bias against men. So do boys now need
positive discrimination?
A new series of Cutting Edge (Monday, 9.00-10.00pm, C4) begins with a
wince-inducing but very watchable fly-on-the-tiled-wall documentary on
dentistry. The patients range from a toddler with a mouth full of stumps to
a woman who worries about her teeth falling out during copulation. The
programme-makers are so keen on an authentic ambience that the sound
engineers attempted to make the drill sound just like it does when it's
resonating through your cranial cavities.
The director's director de jour is Quentin Tarantino, a former video
salesman, and it shows. His films are stuffed so full of references to other
films they almost distract you from the violence. As his latest, Pulp
Fiction, opens, Omnibus (Tuesday, 10.25-11.20pm, BBC1) finds out why his
work is considered too gamey for video release, while the big-name actors he
attracts talk about his talent.
ITV's hunger for a popular drama to rival The Sweeney has cooked up
Ellington (Wednesday, 8.30-10.00pm), in which Chris Ellison plays a sports
promotor and erstwhile boxer who hasn't given up fighting: one paw is still
pushed inside a boxing glove while the other is signing deals. It's all
here: sharp suits, shooters and shady women. But our hero is too clean to be
entirely convincing.
Panel games and political satire go together like Enoch Powell and Tony
Benn, but Have I Got News For You (Friday, 10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) manages to
make the combination work. Expect more name-calling between quiz master
Angus Deayton and team captains Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, who will be
rubbing knees this season with a line-up which includes Glenda Jackson and
Teddy Taylor.
A new season of Performance begins with a revival of Dennis Potter's
prophetically-named Message For Posterity (Saturday, 9.30-11.10pm, BBC2)
written in 1967. John Neville is the prime minister forced out of office
sitting for his portrait, and Eric Porter the painter whose political
palette is restricted to the red end of the spectrum. Quintessential early
Potter with its contrast between public and private morality and a script
that is finely honed.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Accounting for the undeserving rich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The minimum wage debate won't go away. It is now so well rehearsed among the
politically aware that both the arguments and the best examples are known to
all.
But now there is a new twist. Prominent left-wing politicians have usurped
the old Victorian distinction between the deserving (widows, orphans, the
aged) and the undeserving (the feckless, drunkards, scroungers) poor and
applied it to those at the other end of the spectrum.
We thus have the new concept of the undeserving rich. But precisely who they
are and how they are defined is unclear. The Victorians would probably
applaud self-made millionaires who, through ability and effort, created
wealth for themselves and others. They might have been less charitable to
pools winners; but their attitude to inherited wealth was more ambiguous.
In the 1970s some people were taxed at 98p in the pound, which seems a clear
indication someone thought that people in this income bracket didn't need or
deserve any more.
But how to decide on this barrier: Pounds 100,000; Pounds 50,000 or even
Pounds 30,000? Because it is so easy to adapt, some well-padded people find
it inconceivable they could 'exist' on amounts others think is a fortune. As
the late Duchess of Windsor said: 'One can never be too thin or too rich.'
I have recently spotted an important gap in the market. There is an
ever-growing collection of anthologies covering every sort of poetry: the
Oxford Book of Comic Verse, Christian Verse and Garden Verse. But nowhere
can I find the Book of Management Poems. Has none been written? Are managers
passionless or simply too busy?
Perhaps the experience of managing and being managed is so mundane and
commonplace that all poetry is management poetry. But there is joy, elation,
fury and disappointment at every turn in the world of work. Alas, try
looking up job, employment, work or manager in the appendix or topic index
of a great general book on poetry and you're not likely to find much.
Whilst there are many poems whose reflections and ruminations on the human
condition are extremely apposite for managers, none appears to dwell on the
agony or ecstasy of management. Why have we no 'Elegy on an Executive
Washroom'; 'Ode to a Senior Executive' or even 'Lines on a Favourable
Flipchart'?
One of the great charms of poetry is that certain memorable lines are
frequently quoted (and misquoted). Would a sonnet in iambic pentameter be
too much for the businessman? Or perhaps the limerick or the clerihew are
more the sort of thing the corporate culture might ordain.
Managers, like parents, realise that you need both carrot and stick to
motivate and persuade.
The promise of reward and the threat of punishment are powerful weapons in
the armoury of the average manager who needs to discipline and encourage.
Some managers don't believe in punishment, preferring only to withdraw
reward when displeased. Others, from 'the school of hard knocks', believe
that birching - whether psychological, monetary or physical - never did
anyone any harm.
But researchers in London using pharmacological and brain lesion work, as
well as personality tests, have found impressive evidence of two quite
different brain systems.
One means that certain people are highly sensitive to cues of reward and are
disposed towards them. The other means that people are especially responsive
to punishment cues and experience great anxiety in situations where there is
impending or possible punishment. Thus some people will do anything for
reward and ignore the risk of failure, while others are cautious and will do
anything to avoid punishment.
Are marketing people differentially sensitive to reward and accountants
differentially sensitive to punishment? Marketing managers' offices are
often festooned with awards and prizes. This seems to contrast starkly with
the minimalism of accountants whose offices lack all adornment.
Maybe it is true that extroverted, hail-fellow-well-met marketeers can best
be managed by lots of reward. Equally, the threat of public humiliation
alone may be enough to deter the introverted, cautious accountants from
misbehaving and cause them to work very hard.
But the message is clear - threats, even the enforcement of punishment, may
be quite ineffective for some employees, while the promise of small, even
significant, rewards may be quite unappealing for others. The trick, of
course, is knowing which type of person is which.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Chester Barnard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barnard (1886-1961) was a rarity among management thinkers this century in
actually holding down a proper job.
After Harvard - which he left before completing his degree - he joined the
statistical department of American Telephone and Telegraph, a company where
he was to remain for the next 40 years. He ultimately became president of
New Jersey Bell.
Barnard is not everyone's favourite inspiration today but his writings are
described in Tom Peters's and Robert Waterman's book In Search Of Excellence
as 'probably the first balanced treatment of the management process'.
His essential message was that authority in an organisation only exists in
so far as the people working there are willing to accept it. Small groups
can operate informally, but as they grow they have to establish formal
systems to make sure that organisational goals are fully understood and that
individuals can be motivated in support of the organisation's 'purpose'.
Barnard identified today's 'organisation man' stating that 'the most
important single contribution required of the executive, certainly the most
universal qualification, is loyalty, domination by the organisation
personality'.
He enunciated three principles of communication which he applied at New
Jersey Bell and which are pertinent given today's 'flatter' corporate
structures.
Make sure everyone knows what the channels of communications are.
Make sure there is a formal channel of communication to tie in every member.
Make the line of communication as direct or short as possible.
Despite the importance attached to it by some of today's gurus, Barnard's
work remains largely neglected, partly because it is fairly impenetrable.
Barnard admitted that The Functions of the Executive - the book of his
lectures - took five to 10 readings to understand.
The man whose intellect a Harvard professor once equated with that of
Leonardo da Vinci was one of the first thinkers to talk about the chief
executive as shaper and manager of share values in an organisation. He
contrasted this concept with that of the authoritarian, manipulative manager
working strictly on a system of rewards and short-term efficiency.
Barnard saw business organisations as the most effective means of achieving
widespread social advancement: he believed the church and state had failed
because they were concerned primarily with authority rather than
co-operation. He would have been at home with today's concept of company
stakeholders (employees, investors, suppliers and customers). 'I rejected
the concept of organisation as compromising a rather definitive group of
people whose behaviour is co-ordinated with reference to some explicit goal
or goals. In a community all acts of individuals and of organisations are
directly or indirectly interconnected and interdependent.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Management: Sights set on higher ground / A look at a German
lift-truck group which is raising its profile through expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past six months there has been an upsurge of interest in learning
German at Leighton Buzzard, the small Bedfordshire town where Boss Group,
formerly Lancer Boss, makes its lift trucks.
'I've been bombarded with requests for German lessons,' says managing
director Jim Porter. Hardly surprising, perhaps, given that Boss was taken
over in May by Jungheinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer, after
one of the most controversial UK receivership sagas in years.
Yet the old Lancer Boss Group had made its first significant European
acquisition in Germany as long ago as 1983 when it bought Moosburg-based
Steinbock. 'Half of our turnover and staff were German,' says Porter, 'but
attitudes were very insular.' Six months after the takeover, there is still
a palpable feeling of relief in the air at Leighton Buzzard as production of
lift trucks continues and prospects brighten. The visitor feels a bit like
an intruder on an extended honeymoon.
'We are delighted by the acquisition, and hope they are by us,' says Porter
 -an oblique reference to workers' fears that a rival bidder would have
closed the plant down.
Amid the sweetness and light, it is clear that Boss is being transformed
into a different company from what it was under its old owners and founders,
Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw and his brother Trevor.
Yet Jungheinrich, the new owner of both Boss Group and Steinbock (which it
snapped up within days of the receivership), has also been changing over
recent years. For all the heat generated by the receiverships of both the UK
and German ends of Sir Neville's empire, scant attention was paid to the
strategic ambitions of the ultimate acquirer.
While Bob Bischof, chairman of Jungheinrich GB and now of Boss Group,
featured regularly in the blanket coverage given to the saga by the UK
press, Jungheinrich's management board chairman, Eckart Kottkamp, kept a
relatively low profile.
Jungheinrich, along with many in the German engineering sector, has
traditionally preferred to let its products do the talking. Founded in 1953,
it went public in 1990, although all voting shares remain in the hands of
the Lange and Wolf families.
Now Kottkamp has spoken at length about how Jungheinrich has survived the
recession, why it bought Boss and Steinbock, and what it plans to do with
them.
It has been a difficult recession, he admits. 'Reunification in Germany blew
up the industry's capacity beyond its real need, so when the drop in demand
came, the effect was worse,' he says. 'There was tremendous pressure on
prices, and the only exit was on the cost side.'
Costs had to be cut, and all functions were examined to see if they were
strictly necessary. There were lay-offs to adapt to capacity needs  - 600
people or 9 per cent of the workforce last year, mainly in manufacturing.
Organisation structures, from the factory floor to the domestic sales and
service operation, have been drastically reorganised to improve the service
for customers.
So far, so conventional, perhaps - at least in an Anglo-Saxon industrial
context. But, quietly, Jungheinrich has also been doing the kind of things
that would have been unthinkable in many German engineering companies before
the downturn.
Its changing approach to manufacturing is a case in point. Last year
Jungheinrich agreed to form a joint venture near Brno in the Czech Republic
with Linde, its bigger German lift-truck rival, producing electric motors
for both companies worldwide.
This was a significant move for the Hamburg company. While Boss was, and is,
essentially an assembly operation, Jungheinrich, in common with many German
engineering companies, used to lean heavily towards the 'make' side of the
'make or buy' parts dilemma.
Now, says Kottkamp, it wants to concentrate on manufacturing only what is
significant for Jungheinrich's competence, or what the customer recognises
as its competence and is prepared to pay for. Hence the motors joint
venture, which has cut Jungheinrich's motor costs by 40 per cent.
Overall, Kottkamp aims to lower what he calls 'manufacturing depth' - or the
amount of value added that is generated in house - to 35-40 per cent. Some
products are at that stage already, but others are still above 50 per cent,
he says.
As part of this strategy the company set up an office in the Czech Republic
in the spring of last year to co-ordinate the purchase of parts from east
European suppliers. These are currently simple parts, such as steel
fabrications, counterweights and some gear parts. On top of this,
refurbishment of lift trucks has this year mainly been switched from Germany
to a long-established partner in Slovenia.
The recession in western Europe, he says, also forced many suppliers to
increase their competitiveness, offering 'interesting opportunities' for
Jungheinrich in countries such as the UK and Italy, as an alternative to
sourcing in Germany or own manufacture.
All this enabled Jungheinrich to take DM74m (Pounds 31m) out of its
operating costs last year, when its sales dipped from DM1.6bn to DM1.4bn,
ending a long period of continuous growth.
To give itself more protection from the ups and downs of the lift-truck
market, Kottkamp has also been spearheading a diversification drive. 'The
lift-truck industry is an oligopoly, and all the other producers are part of
big groups which are active in other fields. In the long term it is better
to have some balancing activity,' he says.
In January, it made the first step towards building up a second leg, when it
bought Bellenberg-based Wap Reinigungssysteme, one of Europe's biggest
producers of high-pressure cleaning equipment used in industry.
For three years the company was looking for a business which it could judge
and understand, says Kottkamp. The target it was looking for was expected to
have growth prospects at least equal to or higher than lift trucks. The
chosen deal appears to fit the bill given the environmental and quality
issues surrounding the cleaning equipment industry. But the decision to get
yet deeper into lift trucks only four months later seems perverse.
Kottkamp, however, strongly defends the purchases of both Steinbock and
Boss. First, he sees the possibility of broader market coverage, combining
Jungheinrich's strength in the distribution sector and large production
companies with that of Boss - and especially Steinbock - in small and
medium-sized production companies.
Second, Jungheinrich recognised the need to develop a full line of
lift-truck products, offering customers a one-stop approach to all their
materials handling needs - a philosophy that Linde has already used to good
effect. So the Boss products - counterbalanced engined-trucks, sideloaders
and vast container handlers - matched Jungheinrich's battery-powered
warehouse equipment.
Third, says Kottkamp: 'We thought we could realise very fast synergies.'
Jungheinrich's French company MIC could take on production formerly located
at the Boss Barcelona plant, which was not included in the purchase. Some
production of counterbalanced electric trucks will move from Nordstedt, near
Hamburg, to the Steinbock plant at Moosburg, near Munich.
From next year, production of a range of small IC-engined trucks will shift
from Moosburg to Leighton Buzzard. The aim is to achieve economies of scale,
but Kottkamp points out that Jungheinrich is also reducing Europe's lift
truck plants by two - Barcelona and Boss' ill-fated Hyco plant in Italy -
thus easing the industry's overcapacity problems.
Both Kottkamp and Bischof are delighted by the strength of the Boss product
range. Delighted, because the container-handlers in particular have
established a world-leading position, and a very strong presence in Asia,
which Jungheinrich can build on.
They seem surprised, too, because it is hard to see how such products could
emerge from a fragmented, untidy manufacturing operation at Leighton
Buzzard, with no Cadcam system, high management turnover and chronic cash
problems that infuriated suppliers.
Bischof, a tidiness fanatic, says more than 500 tons of scrap have been
removed from Leighton Buzzard since the takeover. A strong proponent of the
takeover from the outset, he admits to having been anxious that executives
from Hamburg might have pulled out after he had shown them round.
Kottkamp agrees there is 'clearly room for improvement' at Leighton Buzzard,
but believes 'the failure of Lancer Boss was due to other areas and not to
the manufacturing facilities'. He is also encouraged by the competence of
Boss managers.
If Bischof's ambitious plans for Leighton Buzzard are approved by Hamburg,
the plant will be transformed over the next few years into a world-class
volume manufacturer of lift trucks. The Boss chairman also wants to achieve
a mixture between the 'chaotic creativity and speed' he has found there and
the stricter, more organised structure of Jungheinrich.
This partly explains why Boss is being kept as a separate company, a
decision that may puzzle advocates of complete integration after takeovers.
There will be central financing of the whole group, says Kottkamp - thus
correcting a big weakness of the old Lancer Boss - and some common
purchasing of parts. Steinbock, for example, would get its electric motors
from the Brno joint venture.
There will also be 'a continuous flow of personnel' between the UK and
Germany, he says, enabling Jungheinrich to improve its understanding of the
new UK subsidiary.
But Jungheinrich has recognised that the products made at Leighton Buzzard
are different from its own, and it makes sense to retain Boss' product
development skills and identity, rather than disperse them throughout the
organisation.
The decision to retain Steinbock as a separate unit within Jungheinrich is
perhaps more debatable. Steinbock makes electric trucks for Boss, but its
own range competes with that of Jungheinrich in a number of product areas.
It is an approach that can be wasteful, because incomplete integration can
reduce the benefits of 'synergy'. Kottkamp points out, though, that
different truck-types are being concentrated at certain plants, creating
centres of manufacturing excellence.
The two brands, Jungheinrich and Steinbock, need to be maintained because of
their strengths in different market sectors. This means there will be some
overlapping, he says, but competition between brands would be limited.
With its expanded product range and geographical spread, Jungheinrich now
has the opportunity to become a truly global competitor, rather than a big
player in European alone. So it will not mind spending a bit on German
lessons at Leighton Buzzard.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (12): Kaunda considers a comeback - Michael
Holman examines the political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was from Zambia's copperbelt that Frederick Chiluba launched his
successful challenge for the presidency, but today it is in this mining and
industrial heartland that the government is facing one of its toughest
tests.
Come the next general election, due to be held by 1996, will copperbelt
voters stay loyal to Mr Chiluba and his Movement for a Multiparty Democracy
(MMD) despite the impact of an economic reform programme which has seen
formal sector jobs cut by anything from a third to a half?
Or will they accept that there was no alternative, see light at the end of
the tunnel, and give Mr Chiluba a second five-year term in office?
Much will rest on the reaction of the country's labour aristocracy, the
50,000 workers on the copper mines. The government is set to privatise the
state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), an exercise which is
likely to see the existing work force cut by at least 10,000 - possibly
twice that.
It was during in the late 1970s that Mr Chiluba emerged as a potential
challenger to founding president Kenneth Kaunda, drawing on two overlapping
constituencies. As leader of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, he
indirectly represented the workers on the copper mines, the sector
responsible for more than 90 per cent of export earnings.
But the copperbelt is also the stronghold of the Bemba people, one of
Zambia's largest tribes. It was Mr Simon Kapwepwe, once Mr Kaunda's deputy,
who was to lead opposition to the one-party regime until his death in
January 1980.
Mr Chiluba, himself a Bemba, assumed Mr Kapwepwe's mantle when he and a
handful of businessmen and politicians founded the MMD in April 1990, a
coalition which transcended ethnic divisions and embraced leaders from north
and south.
The coalition soon broke the one-party rule of Mr Kaunda's United National
Independence Party (Unip), and won a sweeping victory in the October 1991
general election, Zambia's first multi-party poll for more than two decades.
The MMD captured 125 seats in the national assembly, with Unip winning the
remaining 25.
Three years later, the coalition is severely strained. The south is
increasingly associated with the opposition while the MMD's standing has
been undermined by a spate of resignations and dismissals.
Several of the ministers have fallen victim to allegations of corruption,
and of drug trafficking sedatives for the lucrative South African market.
This sleaze factor apart, the MMD is also paying the price of imposing long
overdue, but painful, economic reforms.
The impact on the copperbelt, which in theory should be the party's
stronghold, has already been severe. The formal sector workforce has been
cut by at least a third as some companies have gone to the wall, and the
biggest have reduced their payroll by as much as a half.
The toughest cut is yet to come, as ZCCM prepares for privatisation.
The mining union and the company have reached agreement which will see the
mines' workforce reduced by 10,000 by mid-1996.
This may not be enough, however. Industry experts believe the new owner or
owners of the privatised mining group will make further cuts.
Mr Chiluba has vigorously defended the programme, reminding Zambians that
the MMD came to power on a platform of economic as well as political reform.
Painful as the economic reforms have been, the most serious damage to the
government's reputation has come from the infighting within the
administration, and the poor performance of many of the cabinet and senior
government officials.
Two cabinet ministers resigned in the first nine months, and the ministers
of agriculture, finance, mines and education were dismissed in April 1993.
Next to follow were the Vernon Mwaanga, foreign minister, Nakatindi Wina,
community affairs minister, and Sikota Wina, parliamentary deputy speaker,
who resigned in the wake of allegations involving drug trafficking.
Last July, vice-president Levy Mwanawasa and Ludwig Sondashi, legal affairs
minister, also resigned, bringing the tally of ministers who have resigned
or been dismissed to 13.
Few of those that remain in office have the confidence of the donor
community.
On the face of it, the strongest challenge comes from the National Party,
which earlier this year elected Mr Baldwin Nkumbula, 35, son of the late
Harry Nkumbula, leader of the now defunct African National Congress, as its
president.
Mr Nkumbula has been striking a populist note, urging that the mines be kept
in state hands.
Opposition also comes from another, unexpected source, however. The
tribulations since 1991 have done what might once have been thought
impossible: created a climate of opinion which has allowed Mr Kaunda to seek
to revive the fortunes of Unip.
The party had seemed irredeemably discredited by its autocratic style and
its economic mismanagement during 27 years in power, although it may yet
rise from the ashes.
Today, Unip is led by Mr Kebby Musokotwane, a former finance minister, but
Mr Kaunda, now 70, does not rule out a return to the presidency.
Few Zambians rate his chances very high. Yet it is a measure of the
country's mood that its former president is sufficiently encouraged by the
public response to his meetings around the country to consider attempting a
comeback.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (10): 'We are on the right track' /
Interview with President Frederick Chiluba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN and LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: Structural adjustment is proving a painful process for Zambia: is
the medicine too strong for the patient?
Answer: I agree it is a very painful process, and people complain quite a
lot. But they also understand that we have to lay new foundations for an
economy that had been devastated.
When we took office, inflation was running at 400 per cent. Today inflation
is down to 30-35 per cent; there is fiscal discipline. New roads are being
build, old roads being repaired. There are drugs in hospitals and desks in
the schools. We are on the right track.
Yet infant mortality has risen, life expectancy is falling. . .
Those are symptoms of the system we inherited. The structural adjustment
programme is not the cause of Zambia's problems. It is diagnosis, and it
requires bitter medicine.
Zambia's external debt per capita is one of the highest in the world: is
this compatible with economic recovery?
It is a big problem. I regard it as a form of punishment, and lack of
confidence on the part of the international community. Having got rid of an
autocratic government and introduced democracy, we are burdened by debts
incurred by the previous regime.
What is your response to the manufacturers' complaint that Zambia's
industrial base is being undermined by high taxes on raw materials?
I think these fears will subside. Protective tariff barriers are not the
answer. The answer is a level playing field.
We support regional co-operation and we have insisted on the removal of
tariffs. Some countries have more to do, but we would rather urge them to
remove those tariffs which are making competition unfair than start a trade
war.
Is it not time to abolish the 23 per cent duty on imported raw materials?
We are considering this. Revenue collected is small. At the same time,
industry has for too long been protected, and manufacturers have to become
more competitive.
Agriculture is also in severe difficulties, with perhaps one third of
commercial farmers bankrupt. Shouldn't the adjustment programme take more
account of the strain Zambia is under?
I understand the IMF and the World Bank, and how they work. They want their
money back even if it doesn't come back quickly, because there are other
countries in need. One thing I have learned from IMF and the Bank is to move
away from consumption to production, to move from waiting to doing something
on my own.
That spirit I embrace. No one will come and rebuild our shattered country.
We must do that with our own sweat and blood. We must learn to take the
initiative.
At the same time, the IMF and the Bank must understand there are a lot of
conditions that may be appropriate in Latin America, but not Africa. They
must able to adapt and understand local conditions. That is a matter we have
to negotiate with them - they cannot say 'Take it or leave it.'
Are you satisfied with the pace of privatisation?
About 13 companies have been privatised including Zambia Brewery and
Chilanga Cement, but it's a long, slow process - not because of bureaucratic
inertia. You cannot force people into buying what they are not interested
in.
Meanwhile we have launched the Lusaka stock exchange, which helps the
process. We want to ensure transparency, encourage management-worker
buy-outs, for example, and show that the benefits of privatisation are not
confined to the wealthy.
Has the government decided on a timetable for the privatisation of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines, and whether it will be unbundled?
ZCCM for us is the centre of economic activity. Although we have the
Kienbaum report, there may be other reports. We do not want to depend on
just one group of experts, and we do not believe that the break-up of ZCCM
is necessarily the best option.
And the timetable?
It all depends on how we work things. There are new sources of copper, like
Konkola. We want to attract private investment in this one particular area.
It is much richer than anything elsewhere.
So what are your plans for Konkola? To hive it off as a separate company?
We want to make it as a kind of subsidiary to ZCCM, and that will mean that
private investment will go in without tying it into the existing
arrangement. It's an option. . .
Might the timetable extend beyond the next election?
Certainly. But in the meantime, once ZCCM has been properly capitalised,
there will be more production, and job creation will grow. . .
But you won't get this without foreign capital and privatisation.
Surely. . .
And have you not reached the stage where ZCCM can hardly manage to meet its
operational costs?
There have been improvements. We have reduced unit production costs from 82
US cents a pound to 74 cents. Unfortunately, the price of copper fell which
upset forecasts, but slowly the situation is shaping up for the better. We
can only hope prices don't fall again.
Meanwhile production has fallen.
The accumulated costs and problems to be tackled meant that we could not
have managed a quicker pick-up.
Allegations of corruption and claims that minister have been involved in
drug running have undermined the reputation of your government. What are you
doing about it?
There have been wild allegations, and when these were linked to some
ministers they offered to resign. But we haven't had the slightest
confirmation of their having been involved.
Nevertheless, we have introduced a bill outlining a code of ethics.
Yet senior members of the donor group continue to express concern. Can there
be smoke without fire?
Under the code, ministers are required to declare everything they have and
how they got it, and when. If the donors or anyone else provide evidence of
corruption or influence peddling, I will investigate.
After three years in office have you become authoritarian? And it is
disconcerting to see your official portrait in public institutions - it's
redolent of the Kaunda era.
I could order them to be removed] I think it is a tradition, rather than a
show of being anything. Frankly speaking, many people have said I am rather
weak. I have not forced one single issue either in party in government. No,
I am not authoritarian, I am too liberal to be that. I suffered long enough
under an authoritarian regime.
Perhaps if you were tougher, your party would be in better shape - instead
it seems to be disintegrating.
No. People ought to understand that we are coming from an era where
everybody was oppressed. When freedom comes - freedom of expression,
conscience, association - it is disruptive. But there is no better way to
develop.
Never again will one political colossus stride the country and get rid of
the rights of the people.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (7): Painful adjustments required - The
agricultural sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the deregulation of agriculture, Zambia was flooded with imports
of cheap eggs from Zimbabwe. Zambian consumers were delighted, but farmers
were aghast. Had the farmers got their way, egg imports would have been
banned. But in Zambia's newly liberalised economy, a ban was out of the
question. So Zambian farmers decided to investigate the reasons for the
price difference.
They discovered that in Zimbabwe, chicken feed was 30 per cent cheaper than
in Zambi - and was of better quality, too. In Zimbabwe, 100 hens lay on
average 75 eggs a day, whereas their sisters in Zambia produce only 50.
Zambian farmers began importing stockfeed from Zimbabwe, which in turn
compelled Zambian millers to lower their prices and improve quality. As a
result, Zambian farmers are selling more eggs today than in the bad old days
of state controls.
The example may sound insignificant, but it goes to the heart of the painful
adjustments which have been required of Zambia's agricultural sector since
President Frederick Chiluba did away with import controls, protected markets
and subsidised credit.
There is no doubt that Zambia's 400-odd commercial farmers are hurting.
Financial deregulation caught them unawares. Most borrowed heavily when
interest rates were capped, and are now crippled by the escalating cost of
servicing their debts.
'Liberalisation has come at a fast and furious pace,' says a leading
commercial farmer in Zambia. 'Borrowing is now punitive, but few farmers are
willing to adjust.'
Farmers, he says, had grown accustomed to cheap credit, holiday cottages and
expensive cars. Under the previous regime, there was little incentive to
invest one's own capital, or shed unproductive assets. The deregulation of
agriculture has, however, not proceeded as smoothly as the government would
have wished. Agriculture officials admit they overestimated the ability of
Zambia's small private sector to fill the vacuum when state marketing
monopolies were abolished overnight. Most potential traders say they have
been discouraged from entering the market by the prohibitive cost of credit.
As a result, vast regions of Zambia are now bereft of marketing channels
through which small farmers can sell their surplus produce. And in the rich
farmland of eastern Zambia, one private trading company operates as a de
facto monopoly, dictating the price it is prepared to pay for maize, wheat
and oilseeds, in much the same way as the state marketing boards did in the
past.
Ms Lucy Muyoyeta, Oxfam's resident representative in Lusaka, believes the
handover of agricultural credit and marketing to the private sector has been
a disaster. Commercial banks are unwilling to extend credit to small farmers
because the vast majority of the population has no legal title to land.
Oxfam runs two projects which extend soft credits and agricultural inputs to
some 3,000 families in eastern Zambia. Farmers repay the loans when the
harvest is in. But erratic weather last year led to a high number of loan
defaults. And by Ms Muyoyeta's own admission, the help that aid charities
such as Oxfam can give is but a drop in the ocean compared with the needs of
Zambia's 4m rural dwellers. 'We need far greater investment in rural areas,'
Ms Muyoyeta says. 'Roads must be improved, credit must be targeted to
low-income farmers and storage facilities built. Farmers must also be
encouraged to diversify into cash crops.'
With 9m hectares of good arable land, only one-fifth of which is utilised,
Zambia's agricultural potential has barely been tapped. Ms Muyoyeta believes
the maize monoculture, promoted during the Kaunda years, has left small
farmers vulnerable to competition from cheaper imports, European Union 'food
aid', as well as the vagaries of the weather. During the last season, which
ended in June, maize buying agents appointed by the government bought farm
produce with promissory notes. The redemption of these notes came too late
into the new planting season for farmers to buy seeds and fertiliser, while
some farmers were not paid at all.
To avoid a repetition of 1993's maize marketing fiasco, the government has
relieved the principal buying agents of their duties and made clear that the
country now relies upon private buyers to fill the maize supply gap. This
year, however, the government is extending credit to maize buyers through a
revolving fund which will be operated by commercial banks.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (6): 'The real Africa' - Tourism /
destination for travellers rather than tourists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Livingstone devoted only one paragraph of his journals to the Luangwa
valley in eastern Zambia. He trekked through the plains in December 1866 and
must have had a miserable time: December is the height of the rainy season,
when dry river-beds overflow with treacherous waters, mosquitos thrive, and
trails are washed out.
Had he chanced upon Luangwa in the dry season, he might have been more
eloquent about the richness of its wildlife, the variety of its tropical
hardwoods and the mysterious aphrodisiac properties of the Sausage Tree. But
as it turned out, it was the Victoria Falls which captured Livingstone's
imagination, and the Luangwa Valley, confined to obscurity, remains one of
Africa's best-kept secrets.
More than a century later, Zambia remains a destination for travellers
rather than tourists. Shoddy state-run hotels, bad roads and an unreliable
state airline discouraged many would-be visitors. Tour operators estimate
that fewer than 50,000 genuine tourists visit the country each year.
Tapping Zambia's tourist potential has not been one of President Frederick
Chiluba's priorities. The new government's cost-cutting measures have left
little room for revamping Zambia's dilapidated tourist infrastructure, while
the National Hotels Development Corporation has been dissolved. Its demise
has left many hotels, particularly in rural areas, bereft of adequate
funding. Most of them have now been slated for privatisation.
The private sector has decided to make a virtue out of necessity, promoting
Zambia as 'the real Africa' - a vast land untarnished by package tours, big
hotels or zebra-striped minibuses. A number of private hotel groups are
beginning to examine new ventures, with 33 new lodges planned for the
national parks. In Lusaka, Standard Merchant Bank of South Africa and Anglo
American Corporation are investing Dollars 6m to revamp the 40-year-old
Ridgeway Hotel, one of the capital's landmarks.
For the foreseeable future, however, Zambia is likely to remain a
destination for the adventurous traveller.
The first walking safaris in Africa, pioneered by Mr Norman Carr, a game
ranger in the British colonial service who helped set up Zambia's national
parks, began in the Luangwa valley more than 20 years ago. The tradition has
been continued by Wilderness Trails, which run Chibembe Safari Lodge and
Nsefu Camp in the heart of the South Luangwa national park.
For those with steady nerves, nothing can quite match the excitement of
coming face to face with a herd of 40 elephant, or fording a river teeming
with hippos and crocodiles. The danger, say Chibembe's guides, is more
imagined than real. In 20 years of organising walking safaris, not one
tourist has been mangled by lions. But an armed game park ranger accompanies
the typical three-day expedition for good measure. At night, it is common to
hear the gruff panting of leopard stalking their prey and baboons barking
nervously at the proximity of predators. Hippos emerge from the Luangwa
river to graze. It is best to give them a wide berth - they are
unpredictable beasts which can charge with a speed that defies their bulk.
While Zimbabwe has tended to attract the majority of visitors to the
Victoria Falls, several private operators have begun to offer interesting
alternatives on the Zambian side. Tongabezi Safaris has exclusive access to
Livingstone Island, perched right on the edge of the Falls, where a maximum
of eight guests are ferried by inflatable dinghy or canoe. Livingstone
camped on the island when he first 'discovered' the Falls in 1855.
Tongabezi also organises white water rafting in the gorges of the Zambezi,
downstream from the Falls, as well as boating and canoeing in the quieter
stretches of the river.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (8): Business visitors guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Zambian secretaries move as if they are walking under water,' complained an
impatient business visitor.
Part of the explanation for the apparent lassitude may lie in an exhausting
journey into work on a poor public transport system, or poverty, or
debilitating diseases such as bilharzia.
But it is only part of the explanation.
Few nations are as easy-going, good-humoured and courteous as Zambians who
live life at a pace that might be described as relaxed.
Visitors would be well-advised to move into a different gear themselves.
Impatient drumming of fingers, clicks of irritation, or harsh words in an
attempt to chivvy a slow-motion secretary may release the visitor's tensions
but seldom bring results.
Far better, instead, to tolerate an erratic phone service, rickety taxi, a
less-than-reliable internal air service, and live life at a different pace.
For a start, consider staying out of town, rather than at Lusaka's
city-centre hotels.
Direct international dialling from the rooms is not possible, and
operator-connected calls to London, for example, are charged at a hefty
Dollars 9 a minute. (But beware the Savoy Hotel in Ndola, which levies a
minimum Dollars 45 for three minutes to the UK)
An alternative to staying in the heart of the city is to book one of the 12
thatched rondavels (round huts) at Lilayi Lodge, (tel: 230326/228682-3 fax:
222906) a private game park 20 minutes' drive from Lusaka.
The rondavels have no phones, but considering the erratic nature of Lusaka's
telephone system, and the huge surcharges, that may well be an advantage.
Essential reading is the Chamber of Commerce and Industry house magazine,
Profit.
It is an excellent source of information, and pulls no punches. Published
monthly, it is worth ordering back copies - at about Dollars 2 an issue.
Half an hour's reading will leave you well briefed (tel: 252369, fax:
252483),
The business visitor with time to spare should not miss the opportunity to
visit the Victoria Falls. Take your passport and cross over to the Zimbabwe
side, where amenities - and the view - are better.
Or stay on the Zambian side but retreat to Tongabezi (tel: 3-323235, fax:
323224), a small privately-owned lodge 25km upstream from the Falls.
The five tented cottages and three houses on the curve of the Zambesi are
only a few feet away from the river bank.
Zambian handicrafts can be bought at Zintu, at the Ridgeway Hotel.
Visitors should take precautions against malaria, and remember that Aids is
widespread.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (5): Sales provide a breakthrough -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of two substantial state enterprises - Chilanga Cement and Zambia
Breweries - is a breakthrough for the slow-moving privatisation programme.
The two sales provide a model for future privatisation of medium and large
companies: both divestitures involved complex pre-emptive rights
negotiations with the previous owners and both plan to offer some of their
equity on the Lusaka Stock Exchange to Zambian investors.
An independent trust fund has been set up whose chief task will be to
'warehouse' equity in state enterprises, selling the shares to Zambian
investors, both institutional and individual. The Privatisation Trust Fund
has been offered 30 per cent of the equity in Chilanga Cement for on-selling
to the public, not necessarily in a single transaction.
The Fund is looking closely at the technique used by Ashanti Goldfields to
sell equity to Ghanaian investors as a possible model for Chilanga and the
others that will be sold in the next three years.
Until these two deals went through, the Zambia Privatisation Agency's track
record was unimpressive. Some 158 companies are to be sold in seven
tranches, with the first three tranches dominated by small and medium-sized
enterprises. By the end of August, only 12 sales had been completed, while a
handful of others required approval from the Commissioner of Lands or were
awaiting legal rulings. All but Chilanga (Dollars 21m) and Zambia Breweries
(Dollars 19.5m) were minor sell-offs.
Privatisation is always tricky politically, especially where political
support is as problematic as was the case in Zambia until Mr Dipak Patel,
minister of commerce, and a privatisation enthusiast, took up office this
year. His commitment to the programme is beginning to pay dividends in the
form of accelerating progress.
Other obstacles included punishingly high interest rates, making it much
more attractive to hold Treasury Bills than invest in real assets; the
absence of a capital market capable of mobilising resources for takeovers;
and the complexities of the process itself.
The bulk of the potentially-attractive properties involve pre-emptive right
negotiations with the original owners. The agreements under which these
enterprises were nationalised favoured buyers with pre-emptive rights
because, far from envisaging the return of such assets to private ownership,
the government of the day saw itself as the eventual purchaser. These
agreements have come back to haunt the ZPA.
While it is encouraging that virtually all the former owners with
pre-emptive rights are anxious to exercise their options and regain control
of the businesses, there is often wide disagreement on prices. The ZPA says
that in both the Chilanga and Breweries cases, the buyers eventually
accepted ZPA's valuation.
A deadline of November 25 has been set for bids for several companies being
offered for sale - including Northern Breweries at Ndola, some hotels
including the five-star Pamodzi Hotel in Lusaka, two state-owned edible oils
companies, and trading companies with chains of retail outlets around the
country.
The agency says it will have broken the back of privatisation, disposing of
113 (the first three tranches) of the 158 parastatals, by mid-1995. Many of
these are small operations - stores and dry cleaners  - which can be
processed speedily. Large operations, most of which involve negotiations
over pre- emptive rights, will take longer to resolve, while the requirement
to offer 30 per cent of the equity to Zambian investors in most, although
not all cases, is also a potential constraint.
The final four tranches include some significant operations in the financial
sector (Zambia National Building Society, the State Insurance Corporation),
transport (Contract Haulage), and manufacturing (Dunlop, and Nitrogen
Chemicals).
Still to be tackled are leading utilities - Posts and Telecommunications,
the oil refinery and the railways, although even these pale into relative
insignificance alongside the crunch issue of ZCCM.
The commitment to offer 30 per cent to Zambian investors where feasible and
the predominance of pre-emptive right investors, outside the utilities
sector, implies only a limited role for new foreign investors, including
emerging market funds. Since its launch early this year, the Lusaka Stock
Exchange's activities have been largely confined to trading existing shares
in a handful of foreign-owned companies and parastatals - Standard Chartered
bank, the most active, Bata Shoe, Rothmans, ZCCM, Zambia Sugar and Chilanga
Cement. Turnover is very low, although this has been boosted by trading in
closed-end property funds.
The exchange has two broking firms as members while another four or five
have applied to become licensed dealers in anticipation of more active
market conditions once the Privatisation Trust fund starts offering shares
to local investors.
Dealers say that investors have been 'warmed up' by attractive opportunities
in Treasury Bills. With yields falling dramatically in recent weeks,
institutions and individuals are looking for new investment vehicles. The
trick now is to get companies to seek a listing and sell shares through the
exchange.
The best short-term bet is privatisation, with Chilanga - expected to issue
shares via the Trust fund - likely to be the first formal listing next
April. To speed up the process, the government would be well advised to take
a leaf from the Mauritian book, offering fiscal incentives to companies and
investors alike to participate on the exchange.
With no equity on offer, there will be little to interest emerging market
funds in the near term. Mining aside, the same has been broadly true of
direct investment, where the main participants are Zambian, and not foreign,
companies. After a slow start in 1992, the Zambian Investment Centre
licensed 376 projects worth Dollars 314m last year, and a further 166 valued
at Dollars 110m in the first half of 1994. Ironically, given the volume of
complaints from industrialists, manufacturing has been the lead sector
accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the total, with agriculture (Dollars
115m) responsible for just over a quarter.
However, Mr Kevin Moore, director-general, says that the investment climate
is 'a lot better than a year ago'. The main incentives are corporate tax
rates of only 15 per cent on farm profits and on earnings from
non-traditional (non-mining) exports. Investors do not have to go through
the centre but the advantage is that the licence guarantees property and
employment rights.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (4): Fulcrum of the economy / A look at
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three years after President Frederick Chiluba came to power with a mandate
to privatise Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the source of 90 per cent of
the country's export earnings, the government is no closer to deciding how
and when divestiture is to take place.
Privatisation seems to be the only option open to a mining giant that has
been systematically starved of investment and is burdened with high
production costs, a Dollars 640m foreign debt and mines nearing exhaustion.
Since nationalisation, copper production has nose-dived from a peak of
700,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s to less than 400,000 tonnes. Output
is forecast to halve again by the turn of the century unless ZCCM's
best-explored ore body - the Konkola Deep deposit with mineral resources of
381m tonnes containing 3.5 per cent copper - can be brought into operation
within the next six years.
By some estimates, Zambia's ailing copper industry requires Dollars 2bn of
fresh capital to develop new ore bodies and modernise smelters and
refineries.
While the government acknowledges that it lacks the resources to keep the
copper industry alive, it does not appear to have accepted the tough
consequences of opening ZCCM to foreign investors. This will almost
certainly entail the loss of state control over a company which is not only
the fulcrum of the economy, but a symbol of national independence.
Mr Edward Shamutete, ZCCM's chief executive, warns: 'If the privatisation is
handled badly, it could bring down the government.'
The reluctance to let go of ZCCM is illustrated by the company's year-long
search for a Dollars 600m loan to develop Konkola Deep. Nikko Securities of
Japan has been trying to raise the required funds, so far without apparent
success.
Mr Shamutete still hopes a syndicated credit facility will be forthcoming.
Meanwhile, the government has turned down an offer by Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa to lead a consortium that would develop Konkola
Deep as an independent joint venture - relegating ZCCM to a minority role.
Anglo American is disappointed. As ZCCM's main minority shareholder, having
retained a 27.3 per cent stake in the company following nationalisation, the
South African mining house is as anxious as the government to get Konkola
Deep off to an early start.
The first report on ZCCM's privatisation options, funded by the World Bank,
was a dead letter almost before it landed on ministerial desks in October.
Its central recommendation was to split ZCCM into five operating companies
and to privatise them separately.
Kienbaum Development Services of Germany, the authors of the study, believe
the carve-up would maximise the number of new investors in ZCCM's diverse
operations, while avoiding the politically unpalatable option of handing the
nation's copper wealth to a single overseas mining house or consortium. The
Dollars 300,000 report was rejected by the cabinet, which has ordered
another one.
'We do not believe the break-up of ZCCM is the best option,' President
Chiluba said in an interview. Mr Shamutete was more forthright: 'It was a
rushed job, poisoned by interested parties, with shallow conclusions.'
Anglo American is also opposed to the dismemberment of the company. Mr
Anderson Mazoka, Anglo's managing director in Lusaka, believes the company
would be better managed as a single entity. 'The break-up of ZCCM would lead
to the rapid closure of the less profitable divisions,' he says. He believes
the negotiations to sell off separate units would be long and costly and
would open opportunities for corruption. Few doubt that if ZCCM were to be
privatised intact, Anglo American would become the controlling shareholder.
Mr Shamutete says he is not an opponent of privatisation, but he wants to be
given a chance to box ZCCM into shape before it is offered for sale.
'ZCCM was bled to death under the previous administration,' he argues. Its
profits were milked by the government to diversify the economy, as a result
of which ZCCM became the owner of a host of subsidiaries with no direct
bearing to its core business.
All this is changing. The subsidiaries have been cut off and are slated for
privatisation. A copper trading company in Britain has been closed down.
Some 800 senior staff jobs have gone, and ZCCM has just reached agreement
with the Mineworkers' Union of Zambia to shed 10,000 jobs - one fifth of the
workforce - over the next two years.
Mining analysts, however, believe Mr Shamutete's recovery plan may have come
too late in the day to save ZCCM. Output has continued to decline and
efforts to reduce production costs have only met with partial success.
At 82 US cents for each pound of copper, ZCCM's production costs almost
double the outlays of Chilean mines, the world leaders in copper production.
State-owned Codelco Chile, for example, produces more than twice ZCCM's
copper output with half the number of ZCCM's employees. The comparison
becomes even more unfavourable when one adds ZCCM's overheads and heavy
debt-servicing burden, which add another 20 per cent to the cost of Zambian
copper at the mine gate.
Low copper prices drove ZCCM's operations into the red last year. The
company posted a net loss of K72.6bn (Dollars 99m) for the year ended March
1994, but Mr Shamutete hopes the recent rebound in world prices and his
cost-cutting measures will restore ZCCM's profitability over the coming
months.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (3): Yields have done wonders for growth -
The banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the proliferation in the number of banks is a reliable guide, the old
adage that banks prosper when the rest of the economy is in trouble, is
borne out by Zambian experience. There are now some 30 licensed banks,
although only about 20 are effectively operational, compared with just six
five years ago.
On the surface, hyperinflation and astronomical nominal interest rates and
Treasury bill yields have done wonders for the growth of the financial
sector. The reality is different. The banks are saddled with high ratios of
non-performing loans, especially in agriculture, while the newer players, in
the words of a private sector economist, 'born and bred on the TB market'
lack the professional skill and expertise to appraise loans and make sound
credit decisions.
A core problem for the sector is the failure, as yet, to increase bank
capitalisation ratios. 'A bank can open its door on what it would cost to
buy a Toyota Landcruiser' says one banker, which means that the new, small
players could be in trouble when - rather than if - they are hit by a
significant external setback such as sudden kwacha depreciation or the
failure of a significant borrower.
According to one bank: 'It's a disaster waiting to happen' - a comment
justified by the practice of one small bank which is offering kwacha
interest rates on US dollar deposits. All very well while TB yields were
high and the kwacha stable, but that game seems to be nearing its end. The
Bank of Zambia is watching the situation closely. Legislation to raise bank
capital requirements has gone through parliament and will come into effect
soon. In the meantime, officials point out that with 80 per cent or so of
bank transactions in the hands of a handful of players with strong
international connections - such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Stanbic
 -the probable shake-out in the industry, in the form of mergers and
closures, is unlikely to destabilise it.
For the immediate future, bank lending will be constrained, not just by the
fragile state of many corporate balance sheets, but also by high statutory
reserve and liquid asset ratios. The 29 per cent reserve ratio imposes a
sizeable wedge between the rates at which banks can profitably take deposits
and make loans, while the 35 per cent liquidity ratio has helped sustain
profitability at a time of record TB yields. Both ratios will come down and
the liquid assets ratio (which is non-binding anyway) will go altogether
soon, paving the way for increased lending to the private sector as credit
demand recovers.
Commercial agriculture remains a highly problematic area with the banks
being forced to reschedule loans to farmers hit by drought, rampant
inflation and interest rates and the chaotic liberalisation of the marketing
system.
But private sector lending, lower in real terms today than a year ago, can
recover only if the authorities maintain their tight grip on public sector
borrowing. One statistic above all others highlights the success of Zambia's
stabilisation programme - the decline in inflation from 187 per cent during
1993 to a forecast 30 per cent this year. Fiscal policy, especially the
imposition of 'hard' cash budgets on government departments, and a tight
monetary stance have been the key instruments.
Some, especially in the business and farming communities, ask whether the
cure might not turn out to have been more deadly than the disease. But
private sector criticism of monetary policy has quietened with the recent
dramatic fall in interest rates - down to an average of 43 per cent early
this month from almost 100 per cent in February - a stable exchange rate,
and inflation of les than 1 per cent monthly. Indeed, prime rates of the
main banks had fallen to the mid-30s.
Fiscal discipline has been the most important single component since without
it monetary policy could not have been used so effectively to slow inflation
and stabilise the kwacha. The government is on target to reach its budget
forecast of a broad fiscal balance (a deficit of K11bn) thanks to the
combination of cash budgeting on one hand and improved revenue inflows,
following the creation of the independent Zambia Revenue Authority, headed
by four expatriates and funded by the UK Ministry of Overseas Development.
In the first eight months of this year, the government achieved a primary
budget surplus - that is domestic revenue less non-interest payments - of
some K44bn, enabling it to keep the lid on domestic credit creation. Money
supply growth slowed from 114 per cent in November 1993 to 42 per cent in
August this year, reflecting a decline in net government borrowing and a
marked slow-down in private sector lending, despite the availability of
cheaper money.
By September, the year-on-year inflation rate for September had declined to
29 per cent from 138 per cent at the end of 1993. The compounded annual
yield on 91-day Treasury Bills, which hit a high of 205 per cent in May had
fallen below 60 per cent by September, while the tender rate dropped 13
points in a fortnight to 29 per cent in mid- October.
All of which points first to a revival in private sector credit demand over
the next year, a flattening out of TB yields in the 15-20 per cent range and
 -very likely - an exchange rate shake-out as investors, both Zambian and
foreign, look offshore for more attractive returns. Most of the foreign
players have already quit the TB market. Three months ago about 15 per cent
of the Dollars 200m stock was held by foreigners, but this is now done to 1
or 2 per cent as the markets anticipate kwacha depreciation following the
effective appreciation of the exchange rate during 1994.
With the reserves up to Dollars 330m - equivalent to three months' import
cover at 1992 levels - from Dollars 186m a year ago, limited capacity exists
to absorb any surge in imports and capital outflows, but the central bank is
not in the business of fixing exchange rates, acknowledging that real
exchange rate appreciation will constrain the development of non-copper
exports that is so crucial to the next stage of the adjustment programme.
With import demand relatively slack, and buoyant copper prices, the balance
of payments position ought to have improved in 1994 from the Dollars 110m
current account deficit last year. However ZCCM has been unable to exploit
this; output will be down this year and delayed deliveries to meet sales
contracts at lower prices is undercutting export revenues. With no early
solution to the ZCCM crisis in sight, policy must focus on developing
non-traditional exports on the one hand, while securing further debt relief
on the other. The debt burden is down from more than 275 per cent of GDP to
an estimated 200 per cent at present (about Dollars 6bn). The 1995 Paris
Club negotiations could reduce this by up to a third - to some Dollars 4bn -
which, with the completion of the IMF Rights programme and access to Esaf
funds by mid-1995, will transform the external payments situation from one
that was totally unmanageable three years ago.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (2): Copper industry decision is crucial -
ZCCM's privatisation must create an export platform for a competitive
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate, not just of economic reform, but indeed of the entire Zambian
economy rests on a single, crucial decision - the restructuring of the
copper industry.
'If we get this one wrong', says a top official 'we will impoverish our
people for another 25 years'. He is not exaggerating. Impressive progress in
balancing the budget, slowing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate and
bringing down interest rates, will count for little if the dynamo of the
economy is not privatised in a manner that restores investment confidence,
at home and abroad, and creates an export platform for a competitive economy
in the 21st century.
In recent weeks, a heated public debate has opened up, with the focus
shifting from whether to how the copper-mining parastatal, ZCCM, should be
privatised. This in itself is an important advance, although the decision to
appoint an in-house government committee, including senior ZCCM personnel,
to resolve the debate that has split the cabinet and the country could mean
continuing procrastination, which is just what the economy cannot afford.
Some see a gathering consensus centred on three principles - early
privatisation; partial unbundling of ZCCM, although not to the extent
recommended by the German consultants; and treating the Dollars 600m Konkola
project as a separate entity. Last weekend's dismissal of deputy minister of
mines, Mr Mathias Mpande, an outspoken protagonist of unbundling, indicates
the depth of feeling on the subject.
Unfortunately, some Zambian politicians and officials seem reluctant to
acknowledge that whatever formula they develop will fly only if at least
some of the big-league mining players - Anglo American, RTZ, BHP,
Phelps-Dodge and Gencor - accept its viability.
Zambian policymakers who have courageously put their fate in the hands of
the markets in respect of interest and exchange rates, need to accept that
the same discipline will apply to copper privatisation.
African economies undergoing structural adjustment have to deal with a 'soft
man' World Bank focusing on longer-term structural issues, and a 'hard man'
IMF zeroing in on the more immediate problems of macroeconomic
stabilisation. Invariably, they find it much harder to satisfy the Fund than
the Bank.
Zambia is different; it has made remarkable progress, especially in the past
year, towards restoring macroeconomic balance, but it is lagging badly on
the structural side. Arguably the single most important component of reform
 -even more so than exchange control abolition - has been cash budgeting in
the civil service.
Provided it meets IMF benchmarks at the end of the year, which should be
possible, it will become the third country - after Bolivia and Peru  - to
complete a so-called Rights Accumulation Programme (Rap) - allowing it
effectively to reschedule some Dollars 1.2bn in arrears owed to the Fund
into a long-term loan at concessional rates. An IMF team will visit Lusaka
next month to start negotiations for an Extended Structural Adjustment
Facility (Esaf) signalling the successful completion of the Rap. Fund
officials praise the Zambians for achieving what three years ago seemed a
pipe-dream.
Structural reform is a different ball game. The World Bank is presently
assessing Lusaka's track record in satisfying six benchmarks, amid some
anxiety that a critical report could mean a slowdown in donor disbursements
next year:
land reform, currently mired in deep political controversy, an 'Ethics Bill'
to stamp out corruption, social dimension spending targets in health and
education, privatisation (excluding ZCCM), civil service reform, and, most
immediately, resolving the crisis at state-owned Zambia Airways.
The government says it will close the airline, losing some Dollars 2m
monthly, by the end of the year, replacing it with a privately-owned
carrier. The logistics of this are still unclear, with some in government
insisting that a national airline operating inter-continental flights must
be retained, rather than a downsized, local and regional carrier.
Civil service reform is stalled, partly, officials say, because the
necessary downsizing which would enable the government to compete for scarce
skills by paying market-level salaries, would blow the budget. Privatisation
is beginning to gather momentum with the recent sale of two sizeable state
companies - Zambian Breweries and Chilanga Cement - and the promise by Mr
Ronald Penza, finance minister, to close the state holding company, Zimco,
this year.
None of these hard-core political economy issues will be easy to resolve.
The good news is that, after years of mounting unemployment and declining
living standards, the fall in inflation and interest rates and the
stabilisation of the exchange rate has given the government some real
ammunition to use against its critics. So much so, in fact, that Mr Dominic
Mulaisho, governor of the Bank of Zambia, is emphatic that the reform
programme really is irreversible. 'We are beginning to develop a political
constituency for economic rationality' he says.
Not that new-found macroeconomic stability can be taken for granted; despite
the steep fall in inflation to a forecast 30 per cent in 1994 from 187 per
cent last year, the real exchange rate has been appreciating this year and
an adjustment is probable before too much longer. At K675 to the dollar, the
Kwacha is probably some 10-15 per cent overvalued, and resumed Kwacha
depreciation is likely late this year or early in 1995.
Bankers expect yields on 91-day Treasury Bills down to 29 per cent from 120
per cent six months ago, to fall further, before levelling out at a premium
of 5-10 per cent above the inflation rate. Officials confess that the
precise relationship between inflation and interest rates and the exchange
rate - the Zambia risk premium - is unpredictable.
What matters, though, is that the markets are calling the shots, so that a
re-run of the 1991 debacle when the Kaunda government tried to spend its way
back into office, with disastrous consequences for inflation and the kwacha,
is unlikely. The abolition of exchange controls (with very minor, technical
exceptions) means that if public spending and monetary expansion were to
veer off course in the run-up to the 1996 elections, the kwacha and interest
rates would respond - negatively and quickly, undermining what arguably will
be the government's main electoral platform - the restoration of economic
stability. In the words of one economist: 'The market vote will be the one
that counts'.
The market vote is evident, too, in investment. The Bank of Zambia's opinion
survey of some 200 companies shows a 'decisive' turn for the better in
business and investor sentiment, but the recovery will be slow given the
poor infrastructure, high real interest rates and the scarcity of long-term
capital. Skills and institutional capacity are important constraints too,
and the country is heavily and unhealthily dependent on donor assistance and
expatriates.
Partly because the civil service is poorly rewarded, few of the brightest
and best Zambians work for government, while many have found greener
employment pastures as international civil servants.
Zambia clearly has an international competitive advantage in mining and
agriculture. The resumed interest in mineral exploration - Rio Tinto, JCI,
Gencor, Anglo American, BHP, and Phelps Dodge of the US - is a bullish
development, underscoring the importance of ZCCM privatisation as a vehicle
for drawing substantial new foreign participation into the Zambian economy.
It has enormous agricultural potential, too, in terms of unused land, good
soils and a better climate than neighbouring Zimbabwe. Development has been
constrained by misguided pricing and marketing policies, land ownership
restrictions, infrastructural deterioration and, recently, record interest
rates that have created a serious farm debt problem.
Vociferous manufacturers blame some elements of the reform programme -
especially trade and interest rate liberalisation - for these difficulties.
While the terms of trade have shifted against import substitution
activities, some of which should never have been established anyway, a
handful of manufacturers in textiles, metal processing and agri-business are
flourishing. Factories set up to service a protected home market and a
thriving mining industry, at home and next door in Zaire, are now operating
in a very different and more competitive environment. The net result is
likely to be a slimmed down version of manufacturing as import substitution
gives way to a leaner more export-focused sector, and one reliant on
linkages with mining and agriculture rather than selling final consumer
goods to Zambians.
There is obvious potential in tourism although this is hostage to inadequate
infrastructure and competition from neighbouring Zimbabwe which is
exploiting tourist opportunities far more efficiently.
With mining, agriculture and manufacturing output all falling this year,
there will be little growth, although services, especially finance, are
booming, and there is anecdotal evidence aplenty of vibrant informal sector
activity. Weather permitting, a strong upturn is likely in 1995, although
structural constraints are such that it is going to be a long haul back to
the balmy days of the late 1960s.
Reform is beginning to pay dividends. The economic outlook is brighter than
at any time since the early 1970s - reserves covering three months imports;
falling inflation; a stable exchange rate; an increase in government revenue
to 15 per cent of gross domestic product from 12.9 per cent; and the
prospect of both an Esaf loan next year and substantial Paris Club debt
reduction.
The crucial challenges now are to satisfy the World Bank on structural
reform, while moving rapidly and decisively to privatise ZCCM. The
achievements of the past year will wither and die without the support of
root-and-branch structural change.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (1): Toughest test is yet to come - Zambia
is making a fresh start, with a radical structural reform programme. But
will the medicine prove too strong? Michael Holman investigates
</HEADLINE>

Zambia marks its thirtieth anniversary of independence today in sombre mood.
Rich in minerals, with abundant good farm land, and boasting game parks
whose tourist potential has barely been tapped, the country should be
flourishing.
But mismanagement - notably a disastrous nationalisation programme - and
misfortune, including regional wars, have taken their toll. Life expectancy
is falling, infant mortality is rising, and per capita income is lower today
than it was 30 years ago.
Zambia, is making a fresh start, however. Just three years ago, President
Frederick Chiluba's Movement for a Multiparty Democracy (MMD) swept to power
in the country's first democratic elections for two decades. It ended 27
years of Kenneth Kaunda's autocratic rule, with a pledge to reverse the
country's economic decline and restore political freedom.
Today, President Chiluba presides over a radical structural adjustment
programme which with the assistance of aid worth Dollars 1bn a year is
transforming the economic environment. The toughest test of Mr Chiluba's
presidency, however, is yet to come: the state-owned Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM), responsible for more than 90 per cent of export
earnings, has to be privatised if it is to survive.
Output has slumped from a peak of 700,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1970s to
less than 400,000, and it owes creditors Dollars 640m. Only foreign
investment can save the fourth-largest copper producer in the world, and
this requires a volte-face as rich in symbolism as the 1969 nationalisation.
At that time, the move was greeted as heralding a new era for a country that
was once little more than a fiefdom of Cecil John Rhodes' British South
Africa Company. No wonder, then, that when Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding
president, brought the mines under state control, he could not resist
sounding a triumphant note.
Rhodes' vision of the Company blazing a commercial trail from Cape to Cairo,
in the name of an Empire run by Englishmen, 'is now buried' declared Mr
Kaunda, 'and I hope and pray, never to rise again in this part of Africa'.
Rhodes may have the last laugh. Privatisation will mean that boardrooms in
Johannesburg and London will once again determine the development of the
mines, still at the heart of the economy.
Resuscitating the mines by cutting the 50,000-strong labour force by as much
as a third, and offering former owners the chance to resume the management
role they were forced to surrender 15 years ago, is a complex operation
which carries with it considerable political risks. Yet it will be the
yardstick by which the Chiluba government will be judged, notwithstanding
the progress already achieved.
Trade has been liberalised; subsidies removed; privatisation of other
nationalised industries is under way; foreign exchange controls have been
lifted; the budget deficit reduced; and inflation rates brought down from
187 per cent last year to a forecast 30 per cent in 1994.
After years of one-party rule, the electorate enjoys a choice of three main
parties and a lively press. An outspoken private sector does not hesitate to
criticise government policies.
Reform is under way in other areas. A respected lawyer, Mr John Mwanakatwe,
heads the commission looking at ways in which the country's constitution can
be strengthened. A land commission is investigating changes to the system of
communal land ownership and introducing individual freehold tenure.
The MMD government's reputation, however, has suffered gravely since taking
office. A dozen ministers have been dismissed or resigned, some following
allegations of involvement in corruption and drug-running, others in protest
over the same issues.
For both Mr Kaunda - who may be attempting a political comeback under the
banner of the United National Independence Party (Unip) - and Mr Baldwin
Nkumbula, leader of of the National Party, the past three years have
provided plenty of ammunition as they prepare for an election no more than
two years away. The sleaze factor, retrenchment, cuts in food subsidies, and
the introduction of user fees in the health services, have all strained the
patience of a long-suffering electorate.
Mr Nkumbula has also seized on the ZCCM issue, arguing that there is an
alternative to selling off the mines - although not, so far, explaining what
this could be.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, Mr Chiluba maintains that Zambia is 'on
the right track'. Structural adjustment is a necessity, he argues: it is the
cure, not the cause, of the country's difficulties.
For all the encouraging macroeconomic indicators, many Zambians fear that
the medicine may prove too strong for the patient, whose growth was first
stunted during the colonial period, then further retarded after
independence.
Had Zambia been better prepared for independence, it might have been better
equipped to cope with the pressures that followed. One of the most serious
obstacles not only to post-independence development, but to the successful
implementation of the current structural adjustment programme is the acute
shortage of skills. There is also the weak agricultural base. Both handicaps
can be traced back to the colonial legacy.
Zambia came to independence with little more than 100 graduates and 1,000
secondary school leavers, an indictment of a system which permitted the
remittance of millions of pounds in dividends and profits from the copper
mines while only a fraction was reinvested in the country's social services
and infrastructure.
Nor was it an accident that the agricultural sector had a few hundred
commercial farmers, compared to 5,000 in Southern Rhodesia. Northern
Rhodesia, as Zambia was known, was kept as an economic hinterland for its
southern neighbour - hence African nationalist opposition to the Central
African Federation of Southern and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland (now
Malawi) from its inception in 1953 to its demise 10 years later. It was
barely a year into independence when Zambia reeled under the first of a
series of external blows - the unilateral declaration of independence by
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).
A landlocked country, and thus especially vulnerable to dislocation of trade
routes, Zambia has never known peace in the region. The conflict in
neighbouring Mozambique ended only two years ago, while Angola is still at
war. Until 1990, Zambia was a victim of destabilising tactics by South
Africa. Further external
factors over which Zambia had no control proved to be body-blows: the
mid-1970s fall in the price of copper, from which the economy has never
fully recovered, and the soaring oil prices of the 1970s. Whether the
present reform programme, essentially determined by the donors, takes this
history into adequate account is questionable.
Local critics of the donors point out that in Ghana and Uganda, where
structural adjustment has produced the best results, the governments enjoyed
a freer hand than Mr Chiluba. It was 10 years after introducing structural
adjustment that the Rawlings government faced the electorate. In Uganda,
President Yoweri Museveni runs a de facto coalition that has yet to be
tested at a multi-party poll.
Western donors, say these critics, expect Mr Chiluba to take political risks
that would be unthinkable in the west: a French president, for example,
confronting farmers over the ending of agricultural subsidies, or an
American president taking on the US defence industry. Yet the Zambian leader
has to privatise the mines, at the heart of what should be his political
stronghold, and face elections in 1996.
This task is not made easier by donors' refusal to address an anomaly in
Zambia's external debt obligations which require a country following
economic reform to the letter to maintain a net outflow to the International
Monetary Fund of Dollars 100m a year.
Reform is in danger of failing for a further reason, say the critics: the
frail state of a society that has been buffeted for so long, and whose
institutions have been fatally weakened. Management, whether in the private
sector or the civil service, is thinly spread and getting even scarcer as
Aids takes a daily toll.
President Chiluba readily acknowledges the hurdles ahead. There is, however,
no alternative, he says: 'No one will come and rebuild our shattered
country. We must do that with our own sweat and blood.' Brave words, but
formidable odds.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Shorter hours 'led to jobs increase'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Union campaigns during the late 1980s to cut working hours in the
engineering sector led to higher employment, research for the government has
shown.
The findings will not please ministers, who have argued that reduced hours
would lead to more, not fewer, redundancies.
The research for the Department of Employment challenges the conclusion of
earlier studies which found productivity rose to offset the adverse effects
of shorter hours.
It also contests the view that a reduction in hours is a disguised increase
in wages via a rise in overtime. The report says: 'We found no evidence of
reduced basic hours leading to corresponding increases in overtime.'
But the most politically sensitive finding is that there is some support for
the view that shorter hours provide more jobs by dividing the available work
among more people.
The report's findings are qualified but clear: 'Although our research method
was not ideally suited to shedding light on this proposition, we found some
evidence of greater employment in the short and medium term.
'Given that most of the firms we studied were anyway reducing staffing
levels for other reasons, this employment effect means that the shorter
working week led them to make fewer people redundant,' the report adds.
It concludes that a shorter working week accompanied by appropriately lower
wages can share work among more people.
But if hourly wages are permanently increased by shorter hours the
employment gains could be threatened, it says.
The research by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the London School
of Economics involved interviews with 20 factories which had agreed to a
reduction in the basic week from 39 hours to 37 hours per week.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Masters degree aimed at directors launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A masters degree in company direction has been launched by Leeds
Metropolitan University and the Institute of Directors.
The degree differs from the conventional master of business administration
degree in being aimed at people who have already made it to the boardroom
rather than those aspiring to get there.
Courses - fees for which are Pounds 13,000 - are run in a series of two-day
modules to minimise absence from the boardroom.
Research sponsored by the institute two years ago showed that 92 per cent of
company directors received no training in how to be directors. The IoD backs
a part-time diploma course run under regional franchises by several
universities - the fees are Pounds 4,000 a head. Leeds will allow diploma
holders 24 academic credits towards the 120 needed for the new masters
degree, which is being offered nationally at a cost of Pounds 9,000 per
student.
Some training and enterprise councils have said they will pay up to half the
fees for companies registered in the government's Investors in People
training programme.
Subjects include improving personal effectiveness, information strategy,
measuring business performance, managing relationships, decision-taking and
directing strategic change.
Students for the masters degree will have to carry out a project in their
own company. Instead of being assessed by traditional academic methods such
as examinations, the degree will be awarded on project results, case
studies, presentations and reports.
Mr Chris Pierce, head of the university's executive and manager development
unit, said: 'Students will have to prove there has been a change in their
company as a result of what they have done.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / IoD attacks green paper on disability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tax relief for employers would do more to help disabled people than
extending their rights, the Institute of Directors says today.
In a report it says the high cost of adapting buildings is the main barrier
to increased job prospects. If costs were cut, employers would be encouraged
to take on disabled staff.
The report is in response to the government's disability green paper,
published in July, which the IoD claims is 'fundamentally flawed'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / BBC loses its radio listener majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial radio sector has, it is believed, overtaken the BBC for the
first time, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The latest audience figures, to be announced today by RAJAR, the official
audience research body for radio, are expected to show that the commercial
radio stations went above 50 per cent of total listening in the third
quarter.
In the three months to June 19 the commercial sector took a 47.4 per cent
share of all radio listening in the UK. The symbolic crossover was not
expected until next year.
The commercial share has been boosted by the launching of new stations but
the performance of existing stations has also improved.
The rise of the commercial sector has been rapid. Little more than a year
ago the BBC's five national stations and regional and local radio output
commanded more than 61 per cent of listening.
Apart from the launch of national commercial stations such as Classic FM and
Virgin 1215 - and Atlantic 252 broadcasting from Ireland - the repositioning
of BBC Radio 1 has had a considerable impact on audiences.
Concentration on more public-service aims and adding more speech, including
poetry, drama, and current affairs to the pop music mix has cost the BBC
more than 3m listeners in 18 months.
Commercial radio has increased its share of total advertising in the UK from
about 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Inquiry starts into BAe move to develop airfield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A public inquiry opens tomorrow into what the business community in the west
of England regards as one the most important issues for the region's
economic future.
Mrs Jean Brushfield, the Department of the Environment inspector, will be
leading the inquiry into a fiercely opposed application by British Aerospace
to develop its airfield at Filton, north Bristol, into a commercial airport.
While noise within a densely populated area - especially at night - will be
the main issue at the inquiry, the outcome is crucial to the development of
a principal regional airport for the south-west, and the argument over where
such an airport should be sited.
Watching the inquiry closely will be Bristol's existing Lulsgate airport and
Cardiff-Wales airport, which would both face tough competition, and the
promoters of two grandiose international airport schemes, one on the Severn
estuary and the other near the new Severn bridge.
Local businesspeople believe Filton airport is essential. Mr Chris Curtis,
director of the south-west Confederation of British Industry, said: 'The
south-west is probably the only UK region without a decent airport. We need
one.'
'We are far from certain Lulsgate can provide what we need. To maintain our
place as a major European region we need more airline destinations and
greatly increased services. We believe Filton can provide that. It has ideal
surface communications.'
Within an hour's drive of Filton there are 3.3m people compared with 1.7m
for Lulsgate. Few dispute that the former, close to the M4 and M5 motorways
and railway, is in principle a better location than Lulsgate, which is south
of Bristol and has poor road links and no train service.
There is a drawback. In the past decade more than 4,000 houses have been
built within two miles of Filton. After heated public meetings and thousands
of protest letters, the planning authority, Northavon District Council, has
decided to oppose BAe's application. Bristol City Council, which owns
Lulsgate, is among other objectors.
BAe said its existing airfield, used for company flights run by Air Bristol
and maintenance business, costs Pounds 1.5m a year and is under-used. It
believes scheduled services would prove a 'tremendous attraction' and help
safeguard the company's adjacent manufacturing plant, where more than 5,000
people work.
The company plans a terminal handling up to 350,000 passengers a year.
Operations would be limited to 23,000 annual movements, including 20 each
night, in addition to maintenance flights. There would be no charter
flights, although there would be freight. Airlines would fly 'quiet'
aircraft such as the BAe 146 and it is claimed the noise impact would be
small.
In contrast, Northavon council estimates 1,300 houses would suffer noise
sufficient to warrant insulation, and many expect there would soon be demand
for long-haul services and larger aircraft.
Although BAe says there could be room for two Bristol airports, Lulsgate
fears its success would be undermined. It made record pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.6m in the year to March 31 with 1.2m passengers and said business
travel is the fastest-growing sector. It is the hub for the Brymon services
run by British Airways but, if BAe wins consent, Lulsgate could be
hard-pressed to retain these.
The Department of Transport said the government's strategy was not to direct
from the centre. Instead, it was to 'facilitate the provision of airport
capacity to meet demand substantially where it arises, while minimising the
impact of airport development on the environment'.
Consultants for Avon County Council consider Lulsgate could meet likely
demand until 2005, but approval for Filton would inhibit the necessary
investment. At Lulsgate private capital is being sought to build a Pounds
14m terminal handling up to 2m passengers a year and capable of expansion to
3.5m. This would have its own environmental impact - the airport is in a
green belt.
Bristol City Council, fearful for Lulsgate's future, is sceptical of
Filton's value in determining the region's economic well-being and believes
job creation there could be offset by job losses at Lulsgate.
The south-east regional planning conference, in a report last month,
described Lulsgate as the only south-west airport performing a regional
role. 'The one major drawback is, without doubt, the transport links which
are impossible to improve without massive investment that could not be
justified in a regional context.'
In the Filton debate, it concluded, 'a fine judgment will be required
between the need for enhanced regional and local needs for airport
facilities as against the environmental implications'.
From tomorrow, and until the inquiry is due to end in mid-January, Mrs
Brushfield will need to use that judgment.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Farm agency wins Pounds 1.5m coal clean-up deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adas, the agricultural advisory agency earmarked for privatisation, will
today announce that it has won a Pounds 1.5m contract with British Coal to
clean up 120 opencast sites as the coal industry moves into the private
sector.
The 18-month agreement between Adas and British Coal Opencast, which carries
out surface mining, will involve the restoration of former mining sites for
agricultural or other uses. It formalises a long partnership that has
covered landscaping and the handling of soil during and after mining
operations.
The contract exemplifies Adas' rapid diversification into industries other
than farming as it gears up for a likely sell-off.
The Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit recommended in July that Adas be
privatised. It became an executive agency two years ago. A decision is
awaited from ministers on its future.
This year the agency has to recover 63 per cent of the costs of its
commercial work under its tough financial targets. It started charging
customers in 1987. Before that farmers obtained free advice.
Last year commercial consultancy and research work amounted to 33 per cent
of its Pounds 76m turnover, up from 29 per cent in the previous year,
according to its annual report, which is published today.
Staff numbers have been cut by nearly 700 to 2,215 in the past three years
and many consultants have become home-based with mobile telecommunications
to cut office costs.
Dr Julia Walsh, Adas chief executive, said the agency's traditional work
advising farmers remained vital, especially given the Gatt trade deal, and
the prospect of further Common Agricultural Policy reform and enlargement of
the European Union. 'We're encouraging the industry to get itself into
shape,' she said. 'It's generally agreed that subsidies can't continue at
their present level.'
Adas has diversified into waste management, land reclamation and
environmental work. It recently won an Ecu1.2m (Pounds 940,000) contract
with a Dutch engineering consultancy to manage the clean-up of heavily
polluted industrial and farm land in southern Poland.
The agency manages the government's 29 environmentally sensitive areas,
which cover 12 per cent of agricultural land in England and 24 per cent in
Wales and are designed to promote environmentally friendly farming.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Labour's welfare plans 'would not lift taxes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An independent commission set up by the Labour party will today insist that
its proposed radical reshaping of the welfare state would not lead to
significant increases in public spending and tax levels.
Sir Gordon Borrie, chairman of the Social Justice Commission, will launch
the results of two years' work by claiming that it is not interested in
'squeezing a bit more from the tax system in order to squeeze a bit more
into the social security system'.
Instead he will argue that the large structural changes suggested by the
report - designed to get people off welfare and into work - would create a
modern social insurance system. Backing the concept of 'full employment', it
will stress that social justice and economic prosperity are indivisible.
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, will endorse the main thrust of the
proposals at a London conference to mark the launch of the 400-page report,
entitled Social Justice, Strategies for National Renewal.
But he will stress that only parts of a strategy designed to reshape the
welfare state for the next 15 years will be incorporated as specific
commitments in Labour's manifesto for the next general election.
There were signs yesterday that some of the recommendations favoured by Mr
Blair will provoke a backlash from some unions and leftwing MPs.
The proposal that the party drop its commitment to increase the state
pension in line with earnings as part of a plan to integrate the tax and
benefit system for the elderly is an obvious target. Another is the
commission's support for a wider student loans system.
Union leaders are also disappointed by the suggestion that a new statutory
minimum wage be set below an hourly rate of Pounds 4. The report insists
that a minimum wage is vital to provide a 'floor' for in-work benefits paid
for by the state, but accepts the need for flexibility to avoid higher
unemployment.
A range of financial incentives aimed at removing the poverty and benefit
traps and persuading the unemployed to take low-paid or part-time work are
expected to secure broad approval, as are proposals for a drive to improve
the quality of education and training.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Government nears decision on postal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government will today move a step closer to deciding whether to include
a Post Office privatisation bill in the next parliamentary session, which
starts next month.
With Tory opponents of the privatisation stepping up their efforts to force
the government to abandon the proposed sale, the ministerial committee on
industrial, commercial and consumer affairs will discuss the position this
morning.
Government business managers are thought to have told Mr John Major, the
prime minister, that he will face a tough battle if ministers opt to press
ahead with the bill.
An opinion poll conducted at the end of last week showed opposition to Post
Office privatisation was hardening among Conservative MPs.
The poll of a random sample of 54 Tory backbenchers found that nearly a
quarter of them wanted an integrated Post Office in the public sector with
greater commercial freedom.
The MORI poll, commissioned by the UCW postal workers' union, is part of a
vigorous union lobbying campaign.
Last week eight Conservative MPs signed an early day motion voicing concern
that privatisation would lead to widespread closures of rural post offices.
One in five of the polled MPs also said they were in favour of postponing a
decision about the future of the industry. About 85 per cent said they
thought the Post Office provided a good service, 93 per cent said they
received no complaints about its service and 91 per cent identified rural
areas as a crucial aspect of Post Office work.
The poll also highlighted the level of public opposition to Post Office
privatisation. The MPs said that only 2 per cent of representations they had
received about the Post Office wanted it broken up and sold whereas 77 per
cent were against. Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW general secretary, said the
privatisation had become a 'political time bomb'.
Government concerns, the union said, may have been heightened by an internal
Post Office document warning that privatisation plans could run into legal
challenges because of European competition laws.
The document, according to a Sunday Telegraph report, said planned exclusive
trading arrangements between a publicly owned Post Office Counters and a
privatised Royal Mail and Parcelforce would potentially be in conflict with
the Treaty of Rome.
The ministerial committee will also be discussing today the inclusion of a
gas market liberalisation bill in the session.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Insurers face legal threat on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trades Union Congress will today warn insurance companies that they may
face legal action if they fail to reach agreement with the Securities and
Investment Board over a timetable for compensation arising from mis-sold
personal pensions, Richard Donkin writes.
Part of the uncertainty covering payouts, the TUC says, has been the failure
to agree a 'key date' on which benefits in a mis-sold personal pension
scheme can be compared with the benefits left behind in a company scheme,
thus setting the formula for compensation.
Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, said that affiliated unions could
be forced to take legal action, similar to that taken by Lloyd's Names, if
insurance companies continued to resist SIB plans to force them to agree a
timetable.
'Unless the insurance companies can demonstrate that they are prepared to
make full restitution on an agreed timetable, the whole sorry affair may end
up in court,' he said.
He described the mis-selling of personal pension schemes to people who would
have been better off staying with their occupational pension arrangements as
'one of the great financial scandals of our time'.
He said the TUC would encourage trustees of occupational schemes to examine
how former members could rejoin schemes.
Mr Monks added that it 'should not be left to insurance companies to choose
a date that favours them over their victims'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Exchange reviews role in paperless settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange is considering the creation of a so-called nominee
company for retail investors who will find it difficult to undertake
transactions once a new paperless share settlement system becomes
operational.
The proposals follow a setback to the exchange's plans to retain a
significant role for itself in settlement following the introduction of the
Crest paperless settlement system.
The Bank of England has been overseeing Crest since plans for Taurus, the
exchange's own paperless system, collapsed last year.
The plan is one of several under consideration by the exchange, which may
turn out to have little or no role in settlement.
Under the latest plan the exchange would create a nominee company which
could hold records of private investors' shareholdings in electronic form,
enabling them to buy and sell shares more quickly.
Because it is expected that share purchases will have to be paid for - or
share certificates delivered - five days after each bargain is struck,
investors who prefer to hold their share certificates in paper at home risk
failing to complete their trades on time.
Many private clients have expressed concern about nominee companies,
however, partly because of security concerns. The exchange's nominee company
would operate with Lloyds Bank Registrars, the UK's biggest registrar, in
helping companies to identify the beneficial owners of their shares in the
nominee.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Whatever happened to the monetarists?: Why the Treasury and
Bank no longer take much notice of M4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time was when the publication of figures for broad money supply growth
would be one of the economic highlights of the month. Not any more.
The first Conservative administration of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, now Baroness
Thatcher, believed devotedly in a link between money supply and inflation,
as did many distinguished City economists of the day. Even now figures for
German money supply growth can have a big impact on the financial markets.
However, Thursday's publication of the measure of broad money supply - M4 -
had little effect on traders. And although the government has a monitoring
range for annual M4 growth - of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent - it seems
to play a very minor role in determining economic policy.
Growth in M4 in the year to September was just 4.8 per cent, well towards
the bottom of the monitoring range. Furthermore, analysing the components of
M4 shows that credit growth in the economy is even weaker than the headline
suggests. What the Bank of England calls 'sterling lending to the M4 private
sector', defined as all UK residents other than banks, building societies
and the public sector, grew just 3.7 per cent in the year to September.
If the authorities really believed that broad money growth was an indicator
of future inflation, there would be no need to raise interest rates. However
on September 12 base rates were increased from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per
cent.
In the minutes of his meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on
September 7 Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said that,
notwithstanding the recorded price performance and reasonably reassuring
monetary indicators, the increasing evidence of capacity and price pressures
in the pipeline could not be ignored.
But there are still keepers of the faith who believe that broad money supply
growth is significant. Prominent among them is Mr Tim Congdon of Lombard
Street Research, one of the chancellor's panel of economic advisers - the
so-called 'wise men'.
Mr Congdon argues that it was the slow growth of broad money in late 1990
and early 1991 which has led to the lowest inflation rates since the late
1950s and 1960s. He also believes that the subdued growth rate of M4 means
that inflation will stay low.
There is general agreement on the reasons for the slow growth in M4. The
borrowing binge of the 1980s meant that corporations entered the recession
highly indebted. Many went bankrupt. Those that survived resolved not to
make the same mistake again. They are either paying off their borrowings or
raising finance from other sources.
Meanwhile, consumers have faced many of the same problems as the corporate
sector. They entered the recession with high debts. According to Mr Ian
Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, personal-sector debt
was about 120 per cent of disposable income at its peak.
Debt levels remain high, at about 105 per cent of disposable income.
However, there are some signs that the consumer is borrowing again. The
Central Statistical Office's measures of consumer credit, which cover items
such as credit cards, reached record levels in August, with net lending
reaching Pounds 632m.
But Mr Congdon points out that the consumer credit figures cover only a
small proportion of personal-sector debt. Mortgage borrowings are about
seven times the size of consumer credit, and mortgage lending remains fairly
weak.
According to Mr Congdon, the answer is simple: 'Housebuyers are
over-extended. The ratio of mortgage debt to housing stock hovered around 20
per cent between 1960 and 1990, and is now over 30 per cent. This is only
bearable because of low interest rates.'
Other economists may accept some of Mr Congdon's analysis but they disagree
with his conclusions. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley,
said: 'The behaviour of broad money tells you very little about the business
cycle. At the moment it just tells you that companies are rearranging their
balance sheets.'
He believes that the recent rise in consumer credit is significant because
it shows that consumers, while not yet sufficiently relaxed to borrow for
mortgage purposes, have rediscovered some of their 1980s habits. Rather than
M4 being a forward indicator of the economy, Mr Gardiner believes that the
economy's strength will eventually lead to M4 growth.
The debate may seem arcane but it is important. If believers in the
significance of M4 are right, the Bank of England may seriously damage the
recovery if it pushes for higher interest rates when credit growth is so
weak.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Board pay rises 'at 6.1%': Slowdown seen in rate of
increases for company directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Average pay rises for company directors are running at almost three times
the rate of inflation, a report says today.
The report by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, the pay and benefits consultants, says
the average pay increase for directors in the past 12 months was 6.1 per
cent.
The biggest pay increases, of 9.2 per cent on average, were awarded to
deputy chief executives.
Chief executives did not appear to fare as well, with their average salary
increasing 5.1 per cent from Pounds 91,779 a year to Pounds 96,484 a year.
Divisional managing directors did better, with rises of more than 8 per
cent.
The survey, following an earlier report by Bacon &amp; Woodrow which put annual
directors' pay increases at 8.5 per cent, is further evidence that executive
pay rises have been running well ahead of average earnings.
The underlying average earnings rate in August was 3.75 per cent.
The upward trend in pay increases appears to have been stemmed in the past
three months, however.
Mr Andy Christie, the company's remuneration consulting director, said: 'For
the first time in nearly five years we are seeing a fluctuation in the
market where in one quarter the salaries are marginally up and in the next
they are dipping down again.'
The report says that the average increase for all executives was 5 per cent.
It adds that the highest average pay rises, of 5.2 per cent, were to
executives based in the midlands and the north of England. The lowest
average increases were 2.7 per cent to executives in Wales and the
south-west.
The incidence of performance-related bonuses has risen this year. Almost
half of the executives surveyed were receiving bonuses for achieving
performance targets compared with just over 44 per cent at the time of the
last report in June.
The way that bonuses are being paid is changing. Mr Christie said: 'Team
working is the most popular basis for these schemes while individual
performance, seen to be a more divisive measure, is now the least favoured.'
Trends in executive benefits packages show that health screening is on the
increase, now offered by 70 per cent of companies surveyed. Paid paternity
leave is being offered by a third of the companies.
More companies are offering cash alternatives to company cars but take up
rates are less than 1 per cent at senior levels.

FT  24 OCT 94 / 3 percent rise in basic wage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most pay deals so far this autumn have involved rises of 3 per cent or more
in basic wage rates, ahead of the annual rate of inflation, the independent
Incomes Data Services says today, Robert Taylor writes.
The report covers 97 pay agreements made during the third quarter of the
year from July to September. As many as 48 per cent of them produced basic
pay rises of between 2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, with only 11 per cent
receiving rises of 4 per cent. The proportion of pay deals being settled at
or below 2 per cent has diminished over recent months and there are signs
that the autumn levels of settlements 'may be moving slightly higher'.
These recent higher pay settlements include a 4.5 per cent increase at
Gillette for the company's manual workers, a 4.8 per cent award based on
merit at Guardian Royal Exchange, and 3 per cent at John Brown Engineering.
However the latest pay bulletin from the Engineering Employers Federation,
also published today, suggests that while only 8 per cent of reported
settlements in the last quarter involved pay freezes there is no clear sign
yet of any upward pressure on the level of basic pay settlements.
But increasing overtime work and improved shift rates are believed to have
pushed the overall level of rises upwards in recent weeks. The average level
of pay increases inside the engineering industry was 2.65 per cent from July
to September, only slightly up on the figure for the previous quarter. There
were 227 pay deals reached in the period.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Retreat on council shake-ups set to embarrass ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission will later this week reverse recommendations
to abolish six county councils, according to local authorities which have
worked with the commission.
The move would be embarrassing for the government, which has asked the
commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, to recommend single-tier unitary
authorities to replace the existing two-tier counties and districts.
However, the commission now seems certain to recommend maintaining the
status quo in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent, Lancashire and
Oxfordshire, having originally recommended unitary authorities in all of
them.
In Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire it is likely to favour creating three
and four unitary authorities respectively, while in Hampshire it will
recommend making Portsmouth and Southampton unitary cities, and giving an
independent authority to the New Forest. The two-tier system seems likely to
continue in the rest of the county.
In all cases this would involve altering the first preference originally
published by the commission when it announced provisional recommendations in
June.
Sir John has repeatedly said that the commission would not recommend change
without 'overwhelming' evidence of local support. These proposals would all
follow the majority preferences shown by a survey of public opinion in the
nine counties.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, which has lobbied for
unitary authorities, criticised the survey, saying it had been 'corrupted'
by aggressive publicity campaigns mounted by county councils, which
generally support the two-tier status quo.
In Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, where the most popular option was to
create more unitaries than first recommended, the commission has also
changed its proposals.
The commission has postponed announcements on Berkshire and Leicestershire,
on which it also published provisional proposals in June.
It appears unable to agree on how many unitaries to create in Berkshire,
while in Leicestershire there is controversy over whether Rutland should be
recreated as a unitary county.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, cannot create a new unitary
authority unless it has first been recommended by the commission.
He has asked it to reconsider recommendations for three counties so far, but
the commission has refused to change them on all occasions and it seems
unlikely to do so in future.
Formal announcements will be made on Wednesday.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Managers 'are more confident on sales'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales and marketing managers have become more confident in the past three
months, the Chartered Institute of Marketing says today.
One in five of those surveyed by the institute expects to beat their sales
targets this year, compared with one in 10 of those surveyed in July. A
further 47 per cent expect to match their sales targets.
However, the managers' planned rate of sales growth this year is only 6.4
per cent, down from 7.1 per cent in the previous year. Service-sector
companies are expecting faster sales growth than manufacturing companies.
The survey shows little sign of inflationary pressures in the economy.
Managers are expecting to increase prices by 1.7 per cent this year.
The institute says the survey points to an economy that remains buoyant with
subdued inflation, but with slower growth in the second half of the year
than in the first.
The Centre of Economic and Business Research interviewed 310 managers on
behalf of the institute between September 27 and October 5.
Meanwhile, the economics department of Barclays Bank says the pace of
manufacturing growth is slowing. The bank expects manufacturing output to
grow at 4 per cent in 1995, with the strongest growth coming from the
electronics sector.
Oxford Economic Forecasting predicts that the UK economy will grow at 3.4
per cent in 1995, faster than the OECD average of 3 per cent, but slower
than the world growth rate of 4 per cent.
Inflation is expected to rise to 3.2 per cent in 1995. The OECD average is
2.7 per cent.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Tories move to defuse sleaze row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to review its code of conduct for ministers as part of a
wide-ranging initiative to counter the recent spate of allegations of
financial impropriety.
Mr David Hunt, public services minister, said yesterday the government would
'look at anything which is possible to prove to people' that the highest
possible standards applied in British public life.
Interviewed on BBC TV's On The Record programme, Mr Hunt acknowledged that
an outside body might be set up to inquire into the area of MPs' outside
interests, saying such a step was 'always an option'.
But he said it was 'very difficult . . . to argue in precise terms about
what sort of inquiry there should be when parliament has already decided to
set up a committee of privileges investigation'.
He said he hoped the committee of privileges would 'find a way of looking
into the wider issues involved so that if there is a need for new
guidelines, they will be drawn up'.
His comments came after Mr John Biffen, former Conservative cabinet
minister, used a newspaper article to argue that an inquiry conducted by
people drawn from outside the House of Commons might be needed.
Sir Norman Fowler, former Conservative party chairman, said last week that
the best way forward would be to set up an independent body - modelled on
the Cadbury committee on corporate governance - to examine the whole
question of MPs' outside interests.
Mr Hunt said he had been given a remit by Mr John Major to look at 'some of
the wider issues involved' because the prime minister was 'determined not
only to have but to prove to have the highest possible standards in public
life'.
He said he would be examining ways to 'open up even more' the process of
making appointments to non-departmental public bodies.
He said: 'I would like to find ways in which we could ensure not only that
people can nominate themselves to sit on public bodies but that other people
can nominate those they consider to be the best possible individuals.
'I have been trying to secure more openness, to make people aware that they
can nominate individuals for non departmental public bodies,' he said.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Hitching a ride on the corporate gravy train: Diane Summers
considers where to draw the line on freebies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When does an expenses-paid trip, a day at the races or a night at the opera
stop being part of normal public or corporate life and start to look like
sleaze?
Even the most junior manager is likely to have been faced at some time with
a freebie dilemma.
The gift of a calender from a supplier will probably not cause a second
thought, but what about a case of wine? A nice lunch to keep in touch with a
client is one thing, but does a free golfing trip to somewhere warm add up
to an improper inducement, or just a longer opportunity to cement relations?
Journalists are faced with an abundance of freeloading opportunities. The
'Private Eye test', which is the standard in operation at the Financial
Times, can be adapted for use elsewhere when it comes to deciding whether a
gift, meal or trip is acceptable or sleazy. To apply the test, visualise
whether a mention of the arrangement in Private Eye would cause
embarrassment.
Lobbyists and public-relations specialists also have reason to consider
these matters more than most. Mr Mike Beard, president of the Institute of
Public Relations and head of PR at Taylor Woodrow, the construction company,
has developed a couple of useful tests of his own.
The first is the 'means test'. He draws the line at entertainment 'way
beyond the level the person would normally be able to afford for
themselves'. This level will vary with the individual. A steak in a wine bar
at lunchtime is not beyond the means of most journalists but, said Mr Beard,
'if you want to talk to the chairman of a major company on a piece of
business, you may have to meet him in more expensive surroundings'.
The second is the 'wow test'. When you open an envelope containing an
invitation you either groan or you say 'that's nice', said Mr Beard. But if
you find yourself saying 'wow', then it is time to consider.
It also pays to do an audit from time to time, to check that entertaining is
reciprocal, he said. 'The rule in my department is that we're quite happy to
be bought lunch by our suppliers but we sometimes buy them lunch back. You
must not have a relationship which is too oppressive.'
In Mr Beard's view a night at the opera, with a ticket for an accompanying
partner, is particularly useful when overseas visitors need to be
entertained in the evenings - although Mr Beard is more likely to be spotted
at a rock concert. 'I can't stand opera, to be honest. A rock concert is
low-cost and it's a bit different.' Taylor Woodrow also arranges weekend
outings to theme parks for contacts. 'We have a little barbecue and it's a
chance to talk to them - the cost is incredibly modest. We're buying a bit
of their private time to talk to them about the company,' said Mr Beard.
But in the experience of Mr David Willis, who runs a corporate hospitality
business, there is little point trying to encroach on people's private time.
Hospitality should aim to be in the hours the boss is paying for.
Mr Willis said: 'Sunday is absolutely out. The hard-working executive is
locked away with his family, mowing the lawn and polishing the Daimler.
Saturday is possible if it's a really monster event, like the cup final, or
the rugby international. But people view both offering and accepting
hospitality as part of work.'
Even though such events are seen as part of work, very little work is
actually talked about, said Mr Willis, a director of the National Sporting
Club. 'It's almost infra dig to do any selling at a hospitality event. The
idea is to get Ron and Brenda out for a jolly good day, pour a lot of
champagne down them and give them a few tips for the Derby winners. They
then feel good about you, and the next time you or your sales rep calls
you'll be received in front of the competition.'
The cost of corporate hospitality at top sporting events can approach
Ritz-bill proportions these days. Mr Willis said that it cost upwards of
Pounds 1,500 a head to entertain at the last Wimbledon men's finals, but
'people pay if they've got major international customers coming into London
for deals that are worth millions.'
The British may frown on cultures where baksheesh and special favours to
family members are an expected part of business life. But it would seem that
British standards are, in turn, frowned on by the Japanese and Americans.
According to Mr Willis the Japanese are notably absent from the hospitality
scene. While they will visit clubs in their own time they are shocked by the
notion of taking a working day off to go to a sporting event.
In his experience 'Americans would think it barmy to spend thousands of
pounds at Wimbledon. An MD of a big American company might entertain a
senior partner at the ball game, but they'd buy each other a hot dog and sit
in the public seats. How near you are to the Royal Enclosure, and all those
other layers of importance, is very British.'
Mr Willis said a few companies, such as the supermarket chain J. Sainsbury,
actively discouraged employees from receiving such hospitality. But in his
view 'most Brits don't have a problem on the morality or ethics side of all
this'.
For those who do, the 'Private Eye', 'means' and 'wow' tests remain
reasonable starting points.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Ageing execs become 'predatory managers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ageing executive's fear of being sacked is creating a new breed of
predatory manager seeking to break away from an existing employer and buy
into other companies, a report says today.
According to the report by 3i, the investment capital group, the most common
targets for predatory managers are family-run businesses.
The 3i research shows that the structure of company purchases by outside
managers has changed markedly in the past five years.
The report says that the so-called management buy-in, where a group of
outside managers buys a company from its existing owner, has become an
established means of transferring ownership, accounting for about 600
company sales in the past five years.
Family businesses are the most common target for a buy-in, comprising 43 per
cent of the 285 management buy-in deals backed by 3i between 1986 and 1993.
Analysis showed that 33 per cent of such deals involved privately owned
non-family companies and 17 per cent were disposals from quoted companies,
with another 7 per cent covering other types of business.
Not only have buy-ins grown bigger - the average annual turnover of
companies acquired has more than doubled since 1989 to Pounds 6.5m - but a
growing feature of such deals, according to 3i, is the involvement of
existing internal managers of the target companies. The proportion of these
deals - what 3i calls 'buy-in management buy-outs'  - has doubled since 1990
and now represents half of all buy-ins.
Mr Patrick Dunne, director in charge of 3i's buy-in programme, said they had
become a driving force in the medium-sized business sector. The involvement
of existing management increased motivation and meant that the buy-in team
was better informed about the business.
More recent buy-ins featured the use of non-executive directors and what 3i
called 'second-time entrepreneurs' - people who had built up a successful
enterprise, sold out, and were keen to apply their talents in a new venture.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Receiverships 'staved off'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For every company which enters receivership nearly two others survive their
financial difficulties after the appointment of an investigating accountant,
a survey published today shows.
The Society of Practitioners in Insolvency said this meant that many more
companies were in a financial situation which seriously concerned their
banks than official receivership figures show.
Investigating accountants are paid by companies to look at the viability of
the business. Often banks request a company in which they have an interest
to call in the investigators.
Mr Ian Bradbery, president of the society, said that in 61 per cent of its
survey's cases investigating accountants recommended a solution other than
insolvency.
'It appears that our profession is quite independent enough to take a true
and fair view of a troubled business's prospects and that an investigating
accountant appointment is not the first step to receivership some have
suggested it to be,' he said.
The society also said its survey showed that when an investigating
accountant, after an initial investigation, later takes the receivership of
a company the business is more likely to be rescued. Only a fifth are broken
up after an investigating accountant has been appointed receiver.

FT  24 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Politician's pet spills the
beans - Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mainstream political journalism in Japan has come under fire over its close
relationship with politicians. The debate has been fanned by a recent
article by Mr Shiro Tazaki, a political reporter with the Jiji Press news
wire service, and based on off-the-record conversations with Mr Ichiro
Ozawa, the backroom strategist of Japanese politics.
Japanese journalists have excellent access to the inside stories and
political machinations behind the news. However, very little of this finds
its way into print due to reporters' overriding interest in maintaining a
favourable relationship with the news source. Mr Tazaki's account, which
appeared in last month's Bungei Shunju, a highly regarded cultural and
business monthly, reveals an affiliation which went too far.
Mr Tazaki disclosed that on the eve of Mr Toshiki Kaifu's appointment as
prime minister, Mr Ozawa asked him to 'take his reporter's badge off' and
help mastermind a question and answer manual for a press conference given by
Mr Kaifu.
Mr Tazaki, nicknamed 'Ozawa's bodyguard' by colleagues until he was
unexpectedly ousted from Mr Ozawa's clique two years ago, goes on to say
that if the relationship had remained on favourable footing, he would have
spent the summer in Mr Ozawa's country retreat playing golf during the day
and discussing politics over dinner.
For the ordinary reader, the expose has entertaining passages containing Mr
Ozawa's comments on his fellow politicians revealed to Mr Tazaki in private.
The piece illustrates Mr Ozawa's Machiavellian qualities. It quotes Mr Ozawa
denouncing Mr Kaifu, a former prime minister, as intellectually inferior to
his predecessor Mr Sosuke Uno. Mr Noboru Takeshita, Mr Ozawa's former mentor
of the Liberal Democratic Party and now arch rival, is referred to in less
than flattering terms.
Most mainstream Japanese journalists know Mr Tazaki is not alone in
developing an intimate relationship with politicians. In an industry where a
journalist's ability is judged on how far he or she can follow a politician
into his living room or bedroom, Mr Tazaki was considered an ace reporter.
Now fellow journalists have been angered by his revelations, and many
question the ethics of breaking an off-the-record agreement with a news
source. The high-minded dailies have not even covered the issue. But their
initial response, initiated by the Shukan Gendai, a weekly magazine read by
office workers, was to complain that politicians would not talk freely to
the press as a result.
Ethics were brushed aside by the down market Focus magazine, which offers
readers a range of political, show business and sports gossip. It applauded
the piece as 'unveiling an influential politician's real thoughts'. The
pictorial weekly also poked fun at the panic among politicians caused by the
article, quoting an MP who sympathised that 'Mr Ozawa must feel like he's
been bitten by his pet dog'.
Yet many Japanese journalists recognise such unhealthy proximity between
reporters and their sources as a weakness preventing the press from taking
on the role of critic. They fear that the lack of analytical skills among
reporters could eventually lead to a complete loss of what remains of their
credibility.
In Diamond, a business weekly, Ms Yoshiko Sakurai, a column writer, approves
of Mr Tazaki's attempt to reveal Mr Ozawa's 'real personality' to the
public. However, she questions why the public were not acquainted with
politicians' true characteristics in the first place. Was it because
reporters like Mr Tazaki had suppressed their role as journalists and
resorted to work for politicians, she asked.
In this month's Bungei Shunju, Mr Yasuhiro Tase, a senior reporter at Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, the leading business daily, and Mr Takashi Tachibana, a
freelance journalist who uncovered politicians' links to the Lockheed
bribery scandal in the 1970s, also questioned the future of Japanese
journalism.
Mr Tachibana points out the involvement of journalists in politics is not
only behind the scenes. Media executives are often on government advisory
committees and lose their objectivity towards controversial issues, he says.
The two reporters agree that breaking a rule is undesirable, but claim that
reporters should not let the relationship with a news source overcome the
need to report an important matter. 'Whenever there is a conflict between a
journalist and a politician, the Japanese media seems to side with
politics,' says Mr Tase, an author of a controversial book on Japan's
political journalism.
They cite the need for more journalists who do not take the current system
of political reporting for granted. 'If more reporters refuse to take their
notes to their graves, the relationship between politicians and journalists
could become more mature,' says Mr Tachibana.

vocational schools. A Dollars 272m loan would finance 1,800km of power
lines, while Dollars 85m would be used to build 27 vocational schools and
repair 12. Mr Ermansyah Jamin, head of a negotiating team on private power
plants, said the country was expected to sign agreements with several

Prince Norodom Sirivudh, Cambodian foreign minister, said yesterday he was

minister Sam Rainsy. Prince Sirivudh had threatened to step down if Mr
Rainsy was removed from office. Officially, Mr Rainsy departed in the
interests of unity between the fractious partners in Cambodia's coalition
government. In reality, he had made too many enemies in his battle against
corruption, and had become too popular, too independent and too powerful. Mr
Rainsy had endeared himself to the international financial community through
his skills in economic management.

Mayor Woo Myoung-Kyu ordered inspections of all 17 bridges in the city to
avoid a repetition of Friday's tragedy in which a span of the Songsu bridge
plunged into the Han River taking with it cars, vans and a bus. Former Mayor
Lee Won-jong, sacked hours after the bridge collapse, told parliamentary
hearings on the safety of Seoul bridges last week there was no cause for
concern. The collapse was the latest in a series of construction disasters
in South Korea which engineers blamed on shoddy work, poor quality control
and inadequate maintenance.

A suspected Tamil suicide bomber killed 50 people, including Sri Lankan
opposition leader Gamini Dissanayake, at a presidential election rally in
Colombo last night. 'It was a human bomb,' a military officer said. 'There
was a person in the crowd in the second or third row who had explosives.
There was a blast which was carried forward towards the stage.'
The government immediately called off peace talks with separatist Tamil
rebels, due to resume today, and clamped a curfew on the island. The
November 9 presidential poll, in which Mr Dissanayake was a candidate,
appeared in jeopardy.
Those killed also included Gamini Wijesekera, general secretary of the main
opposition United National Party (UNP) and two former ministers. About 300
people were wounded in the blast, which came just as Mr Dissanayake finished
speaking. Police said the prime suspects were Tamil rebels fighting for a
separate state in the north and east. They have previously been accused of
killing Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa and former Indian prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi.
Mr Dissanayake had been expected to mount a strong challenge to the main
presidential contender, prime minister Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga,
who is the ruling People's Alliance candidate. The UNP lost power to the
Alliance in parliamentary elections last August after ruling for 17 years.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Rolls-Royce hopes for Asian breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine manufacturer, has emerged in pole position
to supply its new large Trent engines for the latest stage in the
multi-billion dollar fleet expansion and renewal programme of Singapore
Airlines (SIA).
The potential engine order worth Dollars 200m or more would represent a
breakthrough for the UK company in the fast growing Asia-Pacific aviation
market by penetrating one of the world's most profitable and prestigious
airlines which has traditionally opted for US engines.
Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's managing director, said the airline was
planning to bring forward its decision to acquire between 10 and 20 new
widebody twin engine aircraft both for expansion and replacement of older
aircraft.
SIA is expected to decide early next year whether to opt for the European
A330 twin engine widebody or its rival, the Boeing 777. Rolls-Royce is
offering its heavy thrust Trent engines for both aircraft.
Although SIA has traditionally chosen Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for its large
airliners, Dr Cheong suggested that SIA was interested in diversifying its
large engine suppliers now that its fleet was growing. SIA currently
operates a fleet of 65 widebody aircraft and expects its fleet to grow to
111 aircraft by 2003. In June, it placed a record Dollars 10.3bn order for
52 Boeing and Airbus widebody airliners including firm orders and options.
The new order would complete SIA's fleet renewal and expansion programme.
SIA has already had talks with Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong based airline
which flies a fleet of Rolls-Royce powered aircraft, over possible
co-operation in engine maintenance. 'The idea would be for SIA to service
Cathay's CFM engines jointly built by General Electric of the US and Snecma
of France while Cathay would service SIA's Trents if it were to go ahead
with a Trent order,' said another Asian airline executive in Singapore.
SIA has 17 Airbus A340 four engine aircraft on firm order, all powered by
CFM engines similar to those equipping the A340s ordered by Cathay. In turn,
Cathay has ordered Trent powered Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s. The
competition between the three leading engine manufacturers (GE, Pratt &amp;
Whitney and Rolls-Royce) to supply their new heavy thrust power plants has
become intense because of the huge sums invested in developing these engines
in the midst of the worst post-war recession in civil aviation.
Senior Rolls-Royce executives have recently stepped up their campaign with
SIA including visits this month from Sir Ralph Robins, the Rolls-Royce
chairman, and Mr John Rose, head of the UK company's aero-engine activities.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Mahathir hits out at Japan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has attacked Japan for
failing to offer sufficient help to its fellow countries in east Asia. Dr
Mahathir, on a visit to Japan, said Japan could make amends for its 'past
dark deeds' by playing a pivotal role in the region.
'We do not need apologies,' said Dr Mahathir. 'What we need it your
co-operation and help to develop us.' Dr Mahathir said he was dissappointed
that Japan still did not want to support the East Asia Economic Caucus
(EAEC), the Malaysian inspired idea for a regional trade forum. Malaysia has
been pushing for the establishment of the EAEC but has encountered
opposition from the US which sees it as a potential trade bloc. Japan is
thought to be unwilling to support the EAEC for fear of upsetting its trade
relationship with the US.
Dr Mahathir has shown increasing frustration with Japan on a number of
issues, including what he feels is a Japanese reluctance to transfer
technology to Malaysia's fast expanding economy. During his visit to Japan
Dr Mahathir called for action to tackle Japan's large trade surplus with
Malaysia. He said the rise in the yen had caused Malaysia considerable
problems and Malaysia would not be seeking any more yen loans. Malaysia had
tried to renegotiate its Japanese loans in the hope of reducing its debt
burden. Kieran Cooke, Kuala Lumpur

FT  24 OCT 94 / Asian tiger cub heading for a tumble: Despite rapid growth,
Malaysia's economic problems are brewing up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is tantamount to heresy to question the performance of Malaysia's
economy. In the lexicon of economic analysis, Malaysia is one of Asia's
emerging tigers. GDP is likely to grow by about 8.5 per cent this year and
similar growth is forecast for 1995.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is convinced that his
country is on course to achieve its long term goal of full industrialisation
by the year 2020, which requires more than 7 per cent growth in each of the
next 25 years. 'We are not an ambitious upstart, we are in fact very
modest,' says Dr Mahathir.
But is it all too good to be true? Amid all the euphoria, sceptics say, a
number of problems are being brushed aside.
In its seventh year of plus 8 per cent growth the Malaysian economy is
showing clear signs of overheating. Imports are growing faster than exports
and consumer spending has risen sharply. The excess liquidity is causing
inflationary pressures and wage rises are outstripping increases in
productivity.
When Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the deputy prime minister and finance minister,
delivers the budget this week, his overall message will be upbeat.
The good news for Malaysia is that the fast pace of export growth is being
sustained. In the first seven months of 1994 total export revenues were
MDollars 83.7bn (Dollars 32bn) - a 22 per cent rise on the same period last
year. The bad news is that imports grew even faster, up 30 per cent to
MDollars 84.3bn.
Malaysia's MDollars 3.4bn external trade surplus from January to July last
year turned into a MDollars 606m deficit this year. Malaysia also faces an
increase in its perennial deficit in services trade, such as shipping and
insurance. There are forecasts that the deficit on the current account could
widen to more than MDollars 7bn this year, compared with a deficit of
MDollars 5.4bn last year.
Much of the increase in imports is due to the purchase of equipment
associated with a multi-billion dollar programme to develop infrastructure
and relieve bottlenecks caused by years of strong economic growth. Military
and commercial aircraft imports have also been heavy.
Imports of consumer goods have risen by more than 20 per cent in the last
quarter. Growth in consumption credit is well ahead of overall loan growth.
Official statistics show that despite strong economic growth, inflation has
been kept in check at well below the 4 per cent mark. But many analysts say
the figures are understated: prices for foodstuffs are rising faster than
government statistics suggest.
The improvement on the foreign investment front cannot be disputed. In the
first eight months of this year Malaysia approved more than MDollars 7.6bn
of foreign investment projects in the manufacturing sector - compared to
MDollars 6bn for the whole of 1993.
Some investors have become wary of China's economic prospects and are
switching back to what they feel are the safer economies of south-east Asia.
There has also been a sudden spurt in regional investment by Japanese
companies keen to escape the burden of the high yen. The downside for
Malaysia is that it imports far more from Japan than from anywhere else:
already the price of the Proton, the Malaysian car, made in co-operation
with Mitsubishi of Japan, has had to be increased due to the surge in the
yen's value.
In the medium to long term there are concerns about Malaysia's ability to
remain competitive with other fast emerging regional economies like
Indonesia and Vietnam. Serious skills shortages constrain Malaysia's ascent
up the technological ladder. A large part of Malaysia's manufacturing sector
is still based on labour intensive enterprises.
Labour shortages have developed in virtually every area of the economy
exerting upward pressure on wages. A recent survey found that nationwide
wages rose 7.3 per cent in the first six months of 1994 while productivity
increased by only 2 per cent.
Over the last 20 years the Malaysian economy has been transformed.
Manufactured goods have replaced primary commodities as the main engine of
economic growth. But Malaysia still has a narrow industrial base.
Electronics and electrical appliances account for about 60 per cent of
manufacturing exports. About two thirds of manufactured exports have import
ratios of 60 to 80 per cent.
At this stage in their economic development South Korea and Taiwan were
developing their own electronics and heavy industrial companies. This is not
happening in Malaysia where multinationals dominate almost every sector of
the electronics industry.
Professor Jomo Kwame Sundaram of the University of Malaya says that far more
needs to be done to nurture the sources of industrial dynamism in Malaysia.
'Unlike Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and even Hong Kong, Malaysian
industrialisation has been heavily dependent on foreign capital and
technology,' says Professor Jomo.
Malaysia is proud of its economic achievements of recent years. But hubris
could lead to unpleasant surprises ahead.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was on course for a convincing victory
in this weekend's controversial referendum amending the constitution and
clearing the way for parliamentary elections in December.
Kyrgyzstan's electoral commission said preliminary results suggested that
more than 70 per cent of those who had voted had approved the amendments.
The final count, which was expected yesterday, was delayed after sudden
snowstorms hampered the horse - riders delivering votes in the more remote
regions of the mountainous Central Asian state.
Before Saturday's vote, Mr Akayev said he hoped the referendum would lead to
a more pro-reform parliament and stressed his commitment to the development
of democracy in the country.
The previous parliament, which was elected in 1990 before the collapse of
the former Soviet Union, had frequently clashed with the president.
Opposition politicians fiercely criticised Mr Akayev's arbitrary dissolution
of parliament and the banning of some outspoken newspapers.
The Res Publica newspaper, the voice of Kyrgyz intelligentsia which resumed
publication before the vote, strongly condemned the referendum although
voters in the streets of the capital, Bishkek, last week appeared largely
indifferent to its outcome.
Following the referendum's approval, 35 parliamentary deputies will be
elected to a lower house, responsible for drafting new laws.
The upper house of 75 deputies will meet twice a year to scrutinise proposed
legislation.
Western diplomats in Bishkek fear Mr Akayev's action might signal a lurch
towards a more authoritarian style of politics, common in the region.
They have urged the president to observe constitutional means for resolving
disputes and will now press for international observers to scrutinise the
forthcoming parliamentary elections.
Since 1991, Kyrgyzstan has established a reputation as one of the most
progressive states to emerge from the former Soviet Union.
Wedged between Kazakhstan and China and boasting few natural resources,
Kyrgyzstan moved quickly to create a market democracy which would attract
foreign investment and harboured ambitions of becoming the 'Switzerland of
Central Asia'.
The monthly inflation rate has been brought down to 0.7 per cent although
Kyrgyzstan's privatisation plans have been slow to materialise.
So far, the international financial institutions have warmly endorsed Mr
Akayev's reforms and have committed more money per head to Kyrgyzstan than
to any other post-Soviet state.
A mission from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US
government's investment agency, which was in Bishkek on Friday continued to
express backing for Mr Akayev's reforms.
Mrs Ruth Harkin, president of Opic, signed a deal committing more than
Dollars 250m (Pounds 155m) of US government support to am American-Kyrgyz
joint venture to extract and process gold from the Jerooy field.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A middle-aged British man was killed and three other Britons wounded
yesterday when gunmen opened fire on their tour bus in the town of Naqada,
about 25km north of the tourist centre of Luxor in Upper Egypt.
Witnesses said three men fired at the bus with automatic weapons before
escaping. The shooting fits a pattern of attacks by Islamic militants, who
have mounted 21 raids on tourist boats, buses and other tourism targets
during the past two years, seeking to wreck the industry and put pressure on
the government.
Yesterday's killing is the third of a foreign visitor in eight weeks. In
August Islamic militants killed a Spanish boy in an attack on a tourist bus
in southern Egypt, wounding his father and the Egyptian tour guide. Gunmen
also shot dead two Egyptians and a German tourist and wounded another in a
gun attack in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in September.
The recent rise in such incidents followed a lull in attacks by the Gamaa al
Islamiyya, the militant group which claims responsibility for the campaign
against tourist targets, and came after claims by the government that they
had smashed the Gamaa's main cells.
The group has also attacked senior officials, policemen and secular
intellectuals who oppose its ideology.
The attacks have come at the start of the main cruise and tour season for
European and North American visitors to Egypt - a season for which the
country's hoteliers, cruise managers and the tens of thousands of others
employed in Egypt's now ailing tourism sector had held high hopes for a
recovery.
Tourist arrivals had improved substantially in July and August on the same
months in 1993. Figures for September are not yet available.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Palestinian committee holds talks on dealing with Hamas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A top-level Israeli-Palestinian troubleshooting committee met in Cairo
yesterday to try to forge agreement on ways of dealing with Hamas, the
militant Islamic Palestinian group behind last week's Tel Aviv bombing,
writes Mark Nicholson.
Palestinian negotiators, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, are arguing that Israel
should abandon its policy of collective punishment of Palestinians living in
Gaza and the West Bank following each Hamas-led attack. Instead, they said,
Israel should support Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, and the interim
Palestinian Authority, by releasing Hamas prisoners and hastening moves
towards a full Palestinian election. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign
minister, joined the talks after morning meetings with both President Hosni
Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, and Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister,
who called on both sides to avoid acts which would 'plunge the region into a
cycle of retaliations.'
The joint Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee was created out of the
original discussions leading to this year's deal on limited Palestinian
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as the chief troubleshooting forum
between the two sides. The Palestinians said they would resist pressure from
Israel to take tougher action against Hamas in Gaza, a move which many fear
might spark bitter intra-Palestinian conflict. 'They can suggest what they
want, but we respond the way we want,' said Mr Zohdi al-Kudra, the
Palestinian ambassador to Egypt.

A US warship has intercepted a ship suspected of carrying Iraqi fuel in a
breach of United Nations sanctions and diverted the vessel to Kuwait under
escort for further investigation, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
'We boarded it and diverted it. It's loaded with diesel fuel that we believe
to be from Iraq,' a US navy spokesman said. 'We have substantial evidence
that she went to Iraq. . . The ship has been turned over to Kuwait.'
The guided missile cruiser Leyte Gulf, part of a ship monitoring operation
carried out in the past four years, stopped the Honduran-flagged tanker Al
Mahrousa in international waters in the northern Gulf on Saturday, the
spokesman said. Navy and coastguard personnel boarded the Russian-built
tanker to check whether it was violating the UN oil embargo imposed on Iraq
over its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, he added.
One shipping source said the vessel, which displaces about 7,300 tonnes when
fully loaded, was carrying about 3,000 tonnes of diesel. It had an Egyptian
and Pakistani crew.
The Kuwaiti government was expected to work with the UN sanctions committee
to decide what to do with the vessel. A Kuwaiti defence ministry spokesman
said he understood the ship would be brought into a Kuwaiti port under
escort later yesterday but declined further comment.
Another Kuwaiti official said Kuwaiti naval officers were inspecting the
ship and would escort the vessel into al-Shuaiba port.
According to the US navy. the captain said the Al Mahrousa had been to Iran.
But the ship had maps only for the Khawr Abdullah waterway leading into
Iraq. It had no documentation, no bill of lading and no manifest.
Kuwait radio said several of the crew indicated it had loaded diesel fuel in
Iraq's port of Basra.
The US vessel that intercepted the Al Mahrousa was part of the UN Maritime
Intercept Operation that monitors ships coming from or bound to Iraq in the
Gulf.
The boarding was the second in 10 days and occurred amid heightened tension
in the Gulf region as a result of Iraq's troop deployment near the Kuwaiti
border earlier this month.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Gazans struggle in the wake of border closure: Julian Ozanne
surveys the economic damage to Palestinians and the threat to the peace
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hisham el-Absie usually plasters walls in Israel but yesterday he was in a
pool hall in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Like 25,000 other
Palestinians living in Gaza, he has been unable to work since Israel closed
the borders of Gaza and the West Bank last Wednesday in retaliation for a
bus bombing by Islamic militants which left 21 Israelis dead.
The closure, which Israel has threatened to make indefinite to separate
Arabs from Jews, will cripple Gaza's economy and undermine efforts by the
Palestinian authority and international donors to demonstrate to
Palestinians that there is an economic benefit from peace.
The move also has serious implications for the fragile political stability
of Mr Yassir Arafat's authority. The continuing failure of the Palestinian
authority to meet expectations for economic benefits plays into the hands of
the Islamic opposition.
'Nobody can predict what will happen. It is a very fragile time in terms of
stability,' said Mr Nabil Abu Irdaina, an senior adviser to Mr Arafat.
'Without economic advancement, without jobs, without investments the
situation is very dangerous because the peace process means nothing to the
ordinary Palestinian - no results.'
Migrant labour remains the backbone of the Gaza economy and PLO officials
have condemned the closure as an 'economic war' on Palestinians. The
Palestinians from Gaza who normally work in Israel sustain extended families
who, even in good times, live close to the poverty line. Their income
supports hundreds of small shops and businesses. In an economy where
unemployment can be as high as 50 per cent and annual per capita income is
around Dollars 800, the loss of this vital source of earnings is
devastating.
According to Mr Alex Pollock, a United Nations economist, the immediate
effect on small businesses is a break down in the credit system and the
economy moves to a cash-only basis. Businesses have to lay off local
workers, exacerbating unemployment.
Furthermore the closure makes its difficult for Gaza to export to Israel and
reduces the tax, value added tax and customs revenue base of the Palestinian
treasury. Mr Nabil Shaath, Palestinian 'minister' for planning and
international co-operation, said the closure also sends negative signals to
investors and tourists.
'The closure creates an extreme form of anxiety among investors and gives
the feeling that anything can happen,' Mr Shaath said. 'It destroys trust
and confidence and deals a heavy blow to our prosperity, stability,
credibility and viability.'
Palestinians have developed survival mechanisms during previous Israeli
closures ranging from borrowing money from extended family members to
selling electronic goods and gold saved for dowry payments. But successive
closures have eroded the coping mechanisms.
The crisis could have been less acute if the PLO and international donors
had got the emergency economic programme off the ground. The World Bank has
released less than 10 per cent of Dollars 720m emergency funding promised
for 1994. The Bank blames the PLO for lack of transparency, accountability
and division of responsibility among competing economic ministers. The PLO
blames the Bank for excessive bureaucracy and what it calls 'donor fatigue,
myopia and arterial sclerosis'. The only real job creating programmes have
been Dollars 52m of projects in education and health carried out by the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency and a Gaza clean-up campaign funded
by Japan and the European Union which created 3,000 jobs.
Donors and PLO officials hope Israel will start to ease the closure soon.
But this time it might be different. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister, has spoken of a possible formal and permanent separation of Arabs
and Jews - a negation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements which
foresees increasing economic integration and the continuing presence of
Jewish settlers in Palestinian areas.
The Israeli cabinet yesterday formally agreed 19,000 new permits for foreign
workers to replace Palestinian migrant workers. The new permits bring
Israel's foreign work force, mainly from Eastern Europe and Asia, to 53,000
and consolidate Israeli moves to lessen its dependence on the Palestinian
workforce.
Every time Israel lifts a closure it whittles down the Palestinian work
force. In 1987 80,000 Palestinians from Gaza were working in Israel. At the
time of the Gulf War the figure was down to 56,000. Since 1993 Israel has
unofficially set the Gaza migrant work force at 20,000-25,000.
Israel's policy of labour substitution will have severe economic effects.
International and local economists agree that economic growth in Gaza will
depend, at least for five years, on continued migrant labour to Israel.
Permanent closure of borders would cause a massive economic slump and force
Gazan integration into the much poorer Egyptian economy.
Mr Shaath said if Israel really wants separation it should remove Israeli
settlements, define borders and allow Palestinians to have their own state
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. 'Separation means independence but what we
have at the moment is separation with occupation which doesn't make any
rational sense,' he said. 'Either we must choose separation or marriage
which means continuing the peace process and economic integration. The
closure is like marriage but with wife beating.'
Israel has consistently said it wishes Palestinian self-rule to be an
economic success. The Jewish state knows the dangers of growing poverty and
extremism on its borders. Israeli ministers are fond of saying 'The only
good neighbours are prosperous neighbours'. But a prolonged closure
increases economic desperation, defeats donor efforts and erodes the fragile
credibility and legitimacy of Mr Arafat in the eyes of his own people.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Clinton ventures abroad in search of votes: Diplomacy can't
do Democrats any harm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's decision to spend nearly a week on diplomacy in the
Middle East, rather than on the search for votes in the American midwest may
not hurt the Democratic party in mid-term elections now only 16 days away.
Mr Clinton himself, yesterday winding up a west coast campaign trip in which
he has been more warmly received than in earlier excursions, said he
detected some improvement in party fortunes.
The president certainly appeared more confident and relaxed than for some
weeks, eloquently expressing his opposition both to the California
referendum on illegal immigration and to the conclusions of the
controversial new book linking race and intelligence.
Some prominent endangered Democrats, like Senator Edward Kennedy in
Massachusetts and Senator Dianne Feinstein in California, do appear to have
re-established leads. But the prospect for substantial Republican gains in
Congress and in governorships remains strong. The polling evidence to
bolster Mr Clinton's belief remains mixed. Two surveys at the end of last
week showed his own standing had received a boost from foreign policy
achievements such as Haiti, Iraq and North Korea but that confidence in his
management of domestic policy and in his character remained low.
Even Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader, conceded in a
television interview yesterday that 'they've been better (at foreign policy)
in the last six weeks than at any time in the administration'.
But three polls also found that for the first time since the Truman
presidency Republicans held a sizeable edge over Democrats among likely
voters. In sharp contrast to 1992, when discontent with 'gridlock' in
Washington helped unseat President George Bush, the surveys found Americans
more comfortable with the idea that if one party held the presidency, the
other should have control of Congress.
Administration officials, only too well aware of the sour and introspective
mood of the electorate, have been careful not to make too explicit a
connection between foreign policy and the elections. President Clinton's
weekly radio broadcast on Saturday, for example, was exclusively devoted to
domestic issues, principally education, and to an attack on alternative
Republican policies.
Mrs Madeleine Albright, the ambassador to the UN, yesterday cast the
president's decision to go to the Middle East solely in foreign policy
terms. 'In no way does it impede the political process going on here,' she
added.
A somewhat different twist was given by Mr David Gergen, the formerly
influential White House aide now virtually invisible as a counsellor at the
state department. 'I think this foreign policy will have precious little to
do with the election results,' he said in a weekend TV interview.
But, he added, 'I think the American people want to know he (the president)
has a strong effective foreign policy ...when they sense that's not
happening, it could cut the heart out of your presidency.' Still, he said
there was no substitute for delivering the goods on domestic policy.
The principal Republican campaign aim is also to emphasise domestic issues.
Yesterday they were claiming to have found a 'smoking gun' in the shape of a
leaked memorandum to the president from Dr Alice Rivlin, the White House
budget director. The memorandum, which Dr Rivlin and other White House
officials said was merely an hypothetical discussion document without
specific recommendations, pointed out that Mr Clinton might find have to cut
social spending and increase taxes in order to continue to reduce the
deficit.
This was enough for Mr William Kristol, a leading Republican strategist, to
charge that it was 'craven hypocrisy' for the administration to allege that
the Republicans intended to slash medicare and social security as a means of
achieving the balanced budget.
The vigour of the Republican response may reflect awareness that its own
heavily promoted 'contract with America,' mostly unfinished business from
the Reagan presidency, seems to be making little headway with the
electorate. One poll found that 70 per cent had never heard of it, while
some Democratic candidates have used it to paint their opponents as captives
of the extreme right.
The overwhelmingly negative tone of so many individual campaigns continues
to dominate the election. A successful Clinton visit to the Middle East,
including Syria, might not appear likely to sway many minds but any
diversion from domestic mudslinging might be beneficial.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Diamond giants accused of rigging prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tomorrow morning in Columbus, Ohio, a court case opens on an apparently
mundane matter: alleged price fixing in the arcane field of industrial
diamonds. But there is much at stake for both accused and accuser. General
Electric, the giant US conglomerate, will be defending its reputation for
integrity, already somewhat battered by recent scandal at its broking
subsidiary Kidder Peabody.
The US Justice Department, on the other hand, is out to prove a point. Under
assistant attorney general Anne Bingaman, the department has launched a
stream of anti-trust investigations, from computer software to car rentals.
Last week it said it was looking at alleged uncompetitive pricing at Nasdaq,
the US stock market. The message is clear: under the Clinton administration,
the old laissez-faire days are over.
The charge in this case is simple: that GE and De Beers of South Africa,
which dominate the world market for industrial diamonds, rigged the world
price in 1991 and 1992. But the plot is complex, and takes in such fringe
characters as an ex-EU industry commissioner and the boss of America's
biggest fibre glass manufacturer.
One fact is not in dispute. In early 1992, GE and De Beers raised prices on
the same types of industrial diamonds at the same time. In GE's view, this
is perfectly natural. In a market with few players, a price move by one
supplier will be promptly followed by the rest. Proving there was a specific
agreement is another matter.
A pivotal figure here is Mr Philippe Liotier, who at the time of the alleged
offences was a director of the Belgian conglomerate Societe Generale de
Belgique (SGB). Among his other duties, Mr Liotier ran Diamand Boart, a
diamond tool-making company controlled by SGB, and a big customer of both GE
and De Beers. He was also on the board of Boart's immediate parent, Sibeka,
GE's chief rival in the manufacture of industrial diamonds. Though majority
controlled by SGB, Sibeka is part-owned by De Beers: more important, De
Beers markets the whole of Sibeka's output, and thus sets its prices.
It seems undisputed that Mr Liotier communicated regularly about De Beers'
prices with the head of GE's European diamonds business, Mr Peter Frenz. But
that, GE would argue, was normal as well. Mr Liotier was a customer; and if
supplier A raises prices, it is natural for the customer to pass the news on
to supplier B. Much therefore depends on whether Mr Liotier was talking to
Mr Frenz as a customer or a competitor.
Mr Liotier, who has now moved on to SGB's parent, the giant French
conglomerate Suez, is a defendant in the trial. He will not be turning up.
Neither will Mr Frenz: according to GE, the US authorities refused to
promise not to arrest him as soon as he got off the plane. The jury will
therefore be treated to a video of Mr Frenz's testimony, compiled in Europe
over six days in July.
Mr Frenz and Mr Liotier, says the Justice Department, were not acting on
their own initiative. On February 12 1991, the two met in Brussels along
with their respective bosses: Viscount Davignon, ex-EU commissioner and now
president of SGB, and Mr Glen Hiner, then head of GE's plastics division. At
that meeting, says the Justice Department, pricing was discussed for the
first time. Neither Viscount Davignon nor Mr Hiner have been charged. Mr
Hiner, right-hand man of GE chairman Mr Jack Welch and head of the US fibre
glass company Owens Corning, says the meeting was about other matters.
Beyond straightforward denial, GE's rebuttal comes in three parts. First,
the evidence is purely circumstantial. Second, GE can prove it made an
independent decision to raise prices in the autumn of 1991. Third, disparity
between the two companies' prices was greater after the 1992 price rise than
it was before.
The Justice Department has no great difficulty with the first two.
Conspiracy cases are usually circumstantial, it says. People are not in the
habit of sitting down to write a document agreeing to fix prices. Second, in
any conspiracy someone has to set the ball rolling. In this case,
apparently, it was GE.
GE's point about price disparity looks stronger. Granted, an illegal
arrangement cannot be defended on the grounds that it did not work. But in a
case based on circumstantial evidence, an apparent strengthening of
competition points the other way.
Meanwhile, what about De Beers? It is not turning up for the trial either,
but seems unconcerned. It flatly denies wrongdoing, and says US courts have
no jurisdiction over it anyway.
Veteran De Beers observers feel the trial is unlikely to have any
significant bearing on De Beers' business either way. Suppose there was
price collusion, they say: the world's most successful diamond company has
weathered far worse storms, and will carry on dominating the world diamond
market for quite a while yet.
