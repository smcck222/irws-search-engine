FT  20 OCT 94 / Waging war over bread and baked beans: Neil Buckley on
superstores' change of direction in their battle against the discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J Sainsbury, broke something of a taboo in
the food retailing industry on Tuesday by admitting that big food retailers
in the 1980s had allowed the prices of basic commodities to 'drift upwards'.
Superstore chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, owned by Argyll,
have always strenuously denied accusations that they 'overcharged'
customers, allowing them to make 'excessive' profits in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. The accusations resulted largely from the fact that the
retailers' operating profit margins at up to 8 per cent were three or four
times those of continental European food retailers.
But superstores did not achieve such margins by putting a few pence on a
packet of sugar or a carton of milk.
They achieved them partly by expanding their ranges to include a far bigger
proportion of high-margin goods such as own-label products, fresh, chilled,
and ready-prepared foods - the creme frache, guavas and microwaveable
lasagne that have transformed the nation's eating habits.
At the same time retailers reduced costs by exploiting the economies of
scale of larger stores, centralising their distribution through large
regional warehouses and investing in check-out scanning and powerful
computer systems.
However, as Mr Sainsbury told the annual convention of the Institute of
Grocery Distribution, the industry body funded by retailers and
manufacturers, allowing basic food prices to creep up opened a gap in the
market for cut-price discounters such as Germany's Aldi and Denmark's Netto,
which have expanded in the UK since 1990.
His comments help explain the so-called 'price war' in the grocery market in
the past year. While there have been promotions on other products,
superstores have focused on cutting prices on basic goods in an effort to
squeeze out the discounters.
That such a war has been waging in certain product areas is beyond doubt.
Cans of baked beans are selling for 4p in discount chains in some regions,
and loaves of white bread for 9p. The competition has taken its toll -
Shoprite, the discount chain operating mainly in Scotland, has issued two
profit warnings and expects only to break even at operating profit level
this year.
While skirmishing on basic food prices goes on superstore groups are
continuing to emphasise their 'added-value', ranging from choice and quality
to big car parks and baby-changing facilities.
Moreover, by continually adding higher-margin products and services,
superstore groups are effectively limiting the damage done to overall gross
profit margins by price competition on basics.
Tesco last month said its gross margin in the latest half-year had recovered
to 0.1 percentage points below a year earlier, compared with 0.7 points in
the previous half-year - thanks partly to its introduction of clothing and
leisure goods into stores.
That ability to protect margins enabled Mr Sainsbury, with Mr David Reid,
finance director of Tesco, and Mr Colin Smith, chief executive of Argyll, to
tell the IGD convention that in spite of the short-term pressures on grocery
retailers, the long-term outlook was bright for the big groups.
All admitted that new superstore sites were dwindling and it was becoming
more difficult to get planning consent for out-of-town stores following
publication of new government guidelines last year. But they suggested
superstores were moving from their 'expansion' stage to 'maturity'.
The way forward, Mr Smith suggested, was to keep on improving product
ranges, cutting costs and raising the performance of existing stores -
emulating the example of Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable
retailer. M&amp;S has increased profits in recent years with limited physical
expansion in the UK.
Moreover, with planning restrictions closing in, the fact that big grocers
invested heavily in prime sites in the past decade left them in a dominant
position in the market.
Mr Reid said: 'I have no doubt that in 10 years' time we will be able to
look back and see that superstores proved to be excellent long-term
investments in a continually changing market.'
But the big groups are finding new routes for expansion. Mr Sainsbury
suggested they had been too eager to leave the high streets, where there was
still business to be done, and where the retailers' new-found skills and
efficiency enabled them to earn acceptable returns.
Both Sainsbury and Tesco have opened revamped town-centre formats, called
Central and Metro respectively. Mr Smith of Argyll also spoke of the need to
're-energise city centre stores and services'.
Having conquered the edge-of-town areas, the big food retailing groups may
start to reconquer the high streets.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Merseyside union official steps down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alan Quinn, a senior member of the Transport and General Workers union
executive from Merseyside, has resigned on grounds of ill health as an
internal inquiry starts into alleged fraud in the area's divisional office.
No charges of wrong-doing are to be made by the executive against Mr Quinn.
A TGWU spokesman confirmed last night that Mr Quinn, 40, had stepped down
after more than 10 years as the Merseyside executive member.
Mr Quinn said he was 'very sad' that he had felt it necessary to leave the
executive, but added he had done so on doctor's orders. Mr Quinn was
regarded as a highly influential figure on the left-dominated executive,
playing an important role in determining union strategy.
His position in the union was believed to have become increasingly
untenable, however, after it was alleged that he had received Pounds 15,181
in expenses from the TGWU for his executive work last year. The money was to
cover loss of earnings, mainly for attendance at meetings in London.
The union's rules entitle an executive member to claim only Pounds 32 a day
for loss of earnings. Mr Quinn's expenses were far higher than those of any
other person on the executive and more than an official could have received
if he had spent every day of the year on union business.
Mr Quinn said yesterday that the figure for his expenses claim was
'inaccurate and not true'. He added that the TGWU's financial officer had
accepted this. The election for his successor on Merseyside will take place
soon.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Companies to sponsor 'vocational A-levels'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 120,000 students in schools and further education colleges will be
able to take corporately sponsored vocational qualifications from January.
Fifteen companies, including American Express, United Biscuits, McDonald's,
and J. Sainsbury, are offering sponsorship for General National Vocational
Qualifications, the government announced yesterday. The qualifications are
intended as a vocational alternative to A-levels to be taken by
18-year-olds. A pilot scheme introducing GNVQs was completed earlier this
year.
The companies' contributions range from providing projects and work
experience to job offers if students reach the right standard. Prizes and
travel bursaries are also on offer for students with the best results.
About 250,000 students are enrolled for the qualifications, and up to half
of these should be eligible to benefit from the sponsorships in some form -
although most will not qualify for direct financial aid. For example,
students taking a GNVQ in leisure and tourism will be allowed to take up the
American Express sponsorship, which offers work experience with local
businesses.
Laing, the construction company, is offering similar support for the
construction and built environment GNVQ, with guarantees of work and project
experience for all students taking the course across the UK.
Announcing the scheme, Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said
the government wanted a quarter of 16-year-olds to be enrolling for the
qualifications by autumn 1996. He said GNVQs could not succeed 'without the
active support, encouragement and involvement of employers'.
Mr Mike Heron, chairman of the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications, said the scheme would ensure that the qualifications would
be relevant to business needs.
The government believes its 'vocational A-levels' will be recognised as a
passport to employment since in theory they provide a middle path between
academic A-levels and narrower, more trade-related National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs), which are designed to be taken in the workplace. Thus
they should be good both for university entrance and for moving straight
into employment.
However, academics such as Professor Alan Smithers of the University of
Manchester have questioned whether it is possible for one qualification to
achieve both aims. Also, a report by government inspectors of schools and
further education colleges earlier this week suggested that students were
still being steered towards A-levels by careers counsellors, even if they
had little chance of passing them.
Other companies involved include Girobank, Hilton National, the NHS Training
Directorate, Peugeot and the Post Office.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Row over milk study grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gathering controversy over licensing in Europe of a milk-boosting
hormone for cows takes a new turn today with three UK scientists accusing
the manufacturer of seeking to suppress research pointing to adverse effects
on the health of cows.
Writing in the weekly scientific journal Nature, the scientists say that
Monsanto, the US biotechnology company, provided them with results of trials
on the incidence of mastitis in cows treated with the hormone, but refused
to let them publish their analyses of the data.
European Union agriculture ministers are due to decide at the end of the
year whether to lift a ban on the use of bovine somatotrophin (BST).
The hormone, an artificially produced version of one that occurs naturally
in cows, increases milk output by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent.
It went on sale in the US in February, but has met opposition from consumer
and animal welfare groups in Europe and from the European Commission, which
says that milk is already in surplus.
The scientists say they pooled the results of eight trials by Monsanto. They
found that BST treatment produced an average 19 per cent increase in the
somatic cell count - associated with an increased risk of mastitis - which
was highly unlikely to be due to chance.
Their request for publication in a veterinary journal was refused by
Monsanto's office in Brussels in 1991 and 1992 on the basis that the raw
material, and any subsequent analysis of it, was confidential, the authors
say.
'Our paper simply seeks to make public results that Monsanto appears to be
making little effort to publicise and that we believe are of importance to
the debate over the licensing of BST,' they say.
The scientists say specialists on intellectual property rights have told
them they are entitled to publish their analyses provided acknowledgement of
the sources is made, which they are happy to do.
Mr Tom McDermott, director of biotechnology communications at Monsanto,
said: 'The assertion (by the authors) that they were somehow entitled to
publish their analyses of other scientists' work, without approval or
acknowledgement, is indefensible.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Vickers confirms workforce cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tank builder Vickers is to cut 235 jobs at its twin plants in Leeds and
Newcastle upon Tyne and 65 jobs are to go from Newcastle-based International
Research and Development, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, it was
confirmed yesterday.
The Vickers Defence Systems redundancies, for which the company is seeking
volunteers, affect managerial, supervisory and support staff. The plants'
513 manufacturing workers are not affected.
The cuts are being made in spite of Vickers' success in winning a Pounds
1.1bn order in July from the government for 259 Challenger 2 tanks.
Defence systems chief executive Mr John Crowther said the present order book
secured the business for five years but the company had to restructure to
respond effectively to 'future market opportunities'.
The redundancies are to be split equally between the Leeds and Newcastle
plants. The company said both would retain the capability to manufacture
complete tanks. A spokesman said the company, which currently employs 1,640
people, was reducing the levels of management.
The loss of the 65 white-collar IRD jobs, confirmed by Rolls-Royce
yesterday, is a further blow for Tyneside, which has been hit by a wave of
redundancies this year.
IRD carries out research and development in materials testing, ceramics and
other fields. It currently employs 156 people.
The job cuts, affecting scientists, engineers and technicians, are the
result of a fundamental review of IRD following a serious fire at its
premises in March.
Until now, half of IRD's work has been for Rolls-Royce companies and half
for outside clients, including Nuclear Electric, the Ministry of Defence and
National Power.
The company is to be relocated to the nearby Parsons Power Generation
Systems site in Newcastle.
Mr David Clelland, Labour MP for Tyne Bridge, whose constituency includes
Vickers' Newcastle plant, described the tank maker's job losses as very
disappointing, especially in view of the workforce's 'tremendous fight' for
the Challenger 2 contract.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Two Tory MPs to quit Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Renton, Baroness Thatcher's last chief whip, and Sir Wyn Roberts,
former Welsh Office minister, are to retire from parliament at the next
general election.
Mr Renton, 62, has been Conservative MP for Sussex Mid for 22 years. He said
yesterday that it was time for the constituency to be represented by a
younger person.
A strong pro-European, Mr Renton said that he would spend the remainder of
his time in the Commons fighting to ensure 'that the clear water between us
and the Labour party is not muddied by stupid calls for Britain to leave the
European Union'.
Sir Wyn Roberts, Tory MP for Conwy since 1970, told his constituency
association in a letter last night that in June he would celebrate 25 years
as the constituency's representative. 'I shall then be within a month of my
65th birthday.'
Mr Renton has a majority of 20,528 and Mr Roberts of 995.

FT  20 OCT 94 / CBI warns employers to cut unit labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers must rein back unit labour costs if the UK is to compete
effectively with Germany and the US on global markets, the Confederation of
British Industry said yesterday.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said that the UK's rivals were
'now moving ahead again' in achieving better unit labour costs.
He pointed out that UK unit labour costs had fallen 1 per cent in the 12
months to the summer of this year, while Germany's had declined by 3 per
cent and those of the US by 2 per cent. 'We are not out of the woods yet,'
he added, in spite of low inflation and rising profits and investment
levels.
Output was only back to 1989 levels and the UK's investment rate was well
behind those of most other countries, 'as is our productivity', Mr Davies
said.
The CBI's increasing concern about unit labour costs has been reinforced by
the findings of its latest pay and performance review carried out for the
CBI by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultants.
This says there has been an 'upward creep in pay settlements' as total
earnings have overtaken productivity since the middle of last year. This has
contributed to 'higher levels of earnings increases' in the UK compared with
the country's main competitors.
The report adds that UK labour productivity is still low - 40 per cent below
that of the US and between 10 per cent and 16 per cent less than in Germany
and Japan.
Mr Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'The pressures now facing
employers are enormous.'
The report warns British employees 'are increasingly conscious that the
pendulum is beginning to swing in their direction' with the economic
recovery while their take-home pay is being squeezed by tax increases.
The survey urges employers to keep down their non-wage labour costs as well
as the level of pay deals.

FT  20 OCT 94 / City hopes exceeded by rise in retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales rose faster than City expectations last month, but official
figures released yesterday indicated that shops were having to cut prices to
attract customers.
Sales volumes rose an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between
July and August, outpacing City forecasts of 0.3 per cent. The Central
Statistical Office said volumes were also 3.7 per cent higher than the same
month last year.
The volume of sales was biggest in food, clothing and household goods, where
price competition is most fierce. Cold weather and competitive pricing
boosted sales of autumn fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best
month for this financial year.
Competitive pricing strategies appeared to affect the seasonally adjusted
values of retail sales, which rose at almost the same rate as volumes, by
3.9 per cent from the same month last year.
On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to
trends, the growth in sales by food retailers far exceeded those in any
other sector and the retail sector as a whole.
In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by
food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while
sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order
houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers
only 0.1 per cent higher.
Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly
higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by
food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year.
The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and
specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent.
Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of
Commerce, said that retailers were achieving volume increases by aggressive
discounting. 'Retail sales growth is being bought at the expense of
profitability,' he said.
Recent figures have been giving contradictory evidence about consumer
demand. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey,
published on Tuesday, showed the fastest rate of growth since December 1993.
The CSO's estimate for August sales initially showed a 0.3 per cent fall,
However, although that was revised upwards to a 0.1 per cent decline
yesterday.
Quarterly figures, which smooth out volatility in month-on-month data, show
that the volume of sales in July to September was 0.9 per cent higher than
in the previous three months and 3.6 per cent higher than in the same period
last year.
The Treasury welcomed the data as a signal of a continuing steady upward
trend in retail sales. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director at the British
Retail Consortium, said the figures gave retailers reason to 'look forward
with cautious optimism to growth through the Christmas trading period'.
But Mr David Hillier, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said: 'Some people
are going to get hung up on the increase in volumes being higher than
expected.' He said that since both quarterly and annual growth had been
hovering around the same levels since the end of 1993, 'growth appears to
have reached a plateau'.
And while the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail
sales after a fall in August, analysts pointed out that consumer spending
was not increasing so dramatically.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Political Notebook: The case for an imaginative Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Kenneth Clarke is to be believed we are in for a dull Budget. No net
reduction in the tax burden, no onslaught against the welfare state, no
radical reshaping of the tax and benefits system.
The stable state economics now in fashion at 11 Downing Street do not make
for political excitement.
Of course it will not be quite as bad as that. Mr Clarke will not be able to
resist the odd theatrical flourish. Keen as he is to don the mantle of
fiscal rectitude the chancellor is an accomplished politician.
The Tory back benches must be given something to cheer. The commentators
must be offered one of those intricate Treasury wheezes which will allow
them to pronounce on the day that he has produced a 'clever package'. No tax
cuts overall does not preclude substantial amounts of cash being shuffled
around.
Mr Clarke must ensure also that the future holds more promise than the
present, that virtue will have its reward in a pre-election tax bribe.
Abstract concepts like permanently low inflation and steady growth do not
win elections. Economic security is important. But the voters want to feel
good as well as secure. That means rising disposable incomes.
The outlook for the public sector borrowing requirement is more promising
than the chancellor admits. It may still be about Pounds 30bn this year and
is likely to remain above Pounds 20bn in 1995-96. But beyond that ministers
expect a much sharper fall towards balance. Just in time for a spring 1997
election.
Public spending will play a critical role. Pre-election tax cuts will depend
on firm spending restraint in the two next years. The reins, of course, will
be relaxed in the immediate approach to the election. They always are. But
that makes it more, not less important, to hold the line now.
By all accounts the meetings of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with
delivering the spending totals, have been unspectacular affairs.
There have been some amusing moments. One came when Mr Michael Portillo
explained with a perfectly straight face that he had not been 'serious' when
he demanded as chief secretary to the Treasury a 60 per cent cut in a large
chunk of the employment budget.
There has been pain for other spending ministers. The road-building budget
has been a particular target. Other departments with big capital spending
allocations, health among them, have been told the private finance
initiative provides scope for a smaller contribution from the taxpayer. In
parallel the Treasury is adopting its familiar and irrational 'equality of
misery' approach, which says that every department must deliver savings
whatever the respective size of, or demands on, services.
Notwithstanding the draconian cuts in its own manpower, the Treasury's
fundamental spending reviews have stalled in the mud of consolidationism.
The defence budget is off-limits and Mr John Major has decreed that the
government must stick to its pledge to increase real spending on health.
The social security budget should deliver big savings as a result of lower
inflation and falling unemployment. There will be a squeeze also on housing
benefit and, perhaps, on income support for mortgage interest payments.
But Mr Jonathan Aitken, the new chief secretary, has discovered that further
significant structural changes will have to await a fifth Tory election
victory. It is scarcely surprising that he is talking already about
introducing technical changes in the way the spending round is conducted.
The net result of all this should be cuts in spending targets broadly in
line with the better inflation and growth outlook. Such 'automatic' savings
should add up to more than Pounds 3bn next year.
But the most interesting aspect of the Budget may be the least obviously
spectacular - the extent to which Mr Clarke improves incentives at the
bottom end of the income scale.
Finding routes back into employment for the nation's underclass is not the
stuff of tabloid headlines. It is one of the more serious economic and
political issues of the 1990s.
Next Monday the Labour party will provide some of its answers with the
publication of the report by its Social Justice Commission. It will suggest
a range of measures - costly at first but self-financing in the longer term
 -to break the dependency culture caused by the interaction of the benefits,
national insurance and benefits structure.
Mr Portillo will counter with details of the tougher test for unemployment
benefit which will be applied under the government's new Jobseeker's
allowance.
But crackdowns on 'scroungers' are not enough.
Mr Clarke must show in the Budget a deeper understanding of the poverty and
benefit traps which keep the poor dependent on the state, and demonstrate
that he is prepared to spend money in the short-term to cure a long-term
problem. Fiscal orthodoxy and imagination do not have to be mutually
exclusive.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Industry reports buoyant orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturing companies are enjoying buoyant domestic orders and are
planning to invest more in plant and equipment, according to the latest
survey from the British Chambers of Commerce.
The proportion of companies working at full capacity has jumped sharply and
is not far short of the pre-recession levels reached in 1989.
The survey deducts the proportion of those reporting a decrease in a factor,
from those reporting an increase, to derive a per cent balance. In the third
quarter a balance of 35 per cent of manufacturing companies reported an
increase in home deliveries, up from 29 per cent in the previous quarter.
There was also a rise in the balance of those reporting higher home orders.
On the export side there was a small fall in the balance of those reporting
higher deliveries, but a slight rise in those reporting higher orders.
Among service companies there was a slight fall in the balance of those
reporting higher home deliveries, but there were small rises in both home
and export orders.
The survey shows signs that the economy might be gathering speed and
encountering capacity constraints. In the manufacturing sector the balance
of those reporting that they are working at full capacity has risen from 29
per cent to 37 per cent, while in the service sector it has risen from 22
per cent to 29 per cent.
There was a slight rise in the balance of manufacturing companies reporting
recruitment difficulties, and the balance remains at its highest level since
1990.
However, companies can increase capacity by investing in new plant and
equipment and the balance of manufacturing companies which are planning to
do so has risen from 22 per cent to 26 per cent.
The home counties north is experiencing the fastest sales growth of all the
UK regions, while Scotland is witnessing the slowest.
The Chambers of Commerce survey is compiled from data from 7,665 companies,
employing 1.14m people, and was carried out between September 2 and
September 23.

FT  20 OCT 94 / CBI warns employers to cut labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers must rein back unit labour costs if the UK is to compete
effectively with Germany and the US on global markets, the Confederation of
British Industry said yesterday.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said that the UK's rivals were
'now moving ahead again' in achieving better unit labour costs.
He pointed out that UK unit labour costs had fallen 1 per cent in the past
12 months to the summer of this year, while Germany's had declined by 3 per
cent and those of the US by 2 per cent. 'We are not out of the woods yet,'
he added, in spite of low inflation and rising profits and investment
levels.
Output was only back to 1989 levels and the UK's investment rate was well
behind those of most other countries, 'as is our productivity', Mr Davies
said.
The CBI's increasing concern over unit labour costs has been reinforced by
the findings of its latest pay and performance review carried out for the
CBI by Ernst &amp; Young, the consultants.
This says there has been an 'upward creep in pay settlements' as total
earnings have overtaken productivity since the middle of last year. This has
contributed to 'higher levels of earnings increases' in the UK compared with
the country's main competitors.
The report adds that UK labour productivity is still low - 40 per cent below
that of the US and between 10 per cent and 16 per cent less than in Germany
and Japan.
Mr Michael Kaltz, partner at Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'The pressures now facing
employers are enormous.'
The report warns British employees 'are increasingly conscious that the
pendulum is beginning to swing in their direction' with the economic
recovery while their take-home pay is being squeezed by tax increases.
It adds: 'Current and planned legislation has both reduced the levels of
take-home pay for employees and increased the burden on the employer. As the
upturn strengthens possible skill shortages and greater mobility could
revive employees' negotiating power.'
The survey urges employers to keep down their non-wage labour costs as well
as the level of pay deals. It suggests that companies should look more
closely at the provision of cars to their employees to see whether they meet
a market need. The survey believes that while a temptation exists to make
concessions on more holiday time and shorter working hours, these might be
regretted when skill shortages emerge.
The survey recommends that companies examine boardroom pay levels to ensure
that directors' remuneration is linked to performance improvement. It
favours more variable pay schemes with bonuses unconsolidated into basic
rates.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Food sales show no sign of slowing: Clothing sector reports
cold weather boost for autumn fashion ranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cold weather and competitive pricing helped boost sales of new autumn
fashion ranges, giving the clothing sector its best month for the financial
year, while food sales continued to show no signs of slowing down, the
British Retail Consortium said yesterday.
The good news arrived as the Central Statistical Office reported that retail
sales volumes grew by an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent between
August and September and 3.7 per cent in the previous 12 months.
According to the BRC women's clothing and footwear were star performers as
overall volume sales by clothing and footwear retailers increased 1.2 per
cent between August and September.
On the basis of three-month figures, which are considered a better guide to
trends, the growth in sales by food retailers, where competition is fierce,
far exceeded those in any other sector and the retail sector as a whole.
In the three months to September the seasonally adjusted volume of sales by
food retailers increased 1.7 per cent from the previous three months, while
sales volumes of mixed businesses such as department stores and mail-order
houses were 1.0 per cent higher and those of specialist non-food retailers
were only 0.1 per cent higher.
Non-seasonally adjusted values for food retailers were also significantly
higher than any other sector. In July to September the value of sales by
food retailers was 6.3 per cent higher than in the same period last year.
The value of sales by mixed businesses were 3.9 per cent higher and
specialist non-food retailers saw their values rise 2.4 per cent.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said the
official figures were perhaps misrepresenting total activity in the food
market because the CSO surveys all large retailers while it only obtains
figures from a sample of small businesses. He said: 'I think they are fully
capturing the gains made by big retailers, but I do not think they are
capturing the loss of market share by small food retailers.'
Household goods stores also saw a boost in sales volumes as a result of
aggressive pricing, rising 0.9 per cent in September compared with August.
According to the BRC, however, the depressed housing market took its toll on
furniture and carpets retailers. The dull housing market subdued sales by
DIY retailers.
While the overall figures appeared to indicate a recovery in retail sales
after a fall in August, many analysts pointed out that consumer spending was
not increasing so dramatically.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at broker Salomon Brothers, said: 'If
volumes are growing steadily, normally you would say that consumer spending
is relatively buoyant, but it is hard to read it that way because the values
are slowing.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Lloyd's keen on fresh deal out of court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London is prepared to make a fresh attempt at forging an
out-of-court deal between loss-making Names and the professional agencies
they are suing, Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of the insurance market,
indicated yesterday.
If there is a 'strong mood and some optimism' that a deal is possible, he
and Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, 'will do everything that we can to
see that that settlement is reached,' Mr Middleton said.
His comments, at a conference organised by accountancy and banking company
Smith &amp; Williamson, followed the opening this week of the latest court
battle mounted by Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the
insurance market.
The Feltrim Names Association is claiming Pounds 525m in damages for losses
incurred in the late 1980s as a result of 'spiral' insurance by which
underwriters agreed to cover others for excessive losses from catastrophes.
Earlier this year Names rejected a Lloyd's settlement offer worth Pounds
900m. Subsequently the Gooda Walker action group won damages it says are
worth Pounds 504m.
Mr Middleton believed the Gooda Walker case had not acted as the catalyst
for an out-of-court settlement for other legal actions largely because the
level of damages had yet to be agreed. A final level might not be set for
some weeks.
But he said that 'in a couple of weeks' he and Mr Rowland would assess the
strength of support for a deal among Names' groups and the
errors-and-omissions insurers who provided Lloyd's managing and members'
agencies with cover against negligence awards.
The insurers feel that the action groups might have to accept that they will
never recoup a large part of their losses - because the errors-and-omissions
cover is not sufficient and much of it is underwritten by other Names.
Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton, who are keen to mark a break from Lloyd's past
losses, are reluctant to make an enhanced central contribution to any offer.
But there is optimism among Lloyd's authorities that it might be possible to
strike a deal before the end of next year.
Lloyd's hopes to have established Newco by then - a company set up to take
on the liabilities outstanding from policies written in 1985 and before.
That might clarify the position of many Names involved in litigation.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Tories 'held talks on gerrymandering': First day of
Westminster City Council probe hears claims of social engineering objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Tory councillors and officials of Westminster City Council discussed
the 'economic justification for gerrymandering', according to handwritten
notes by its housing director, the public inquiry into the council's housing
policies was told yesterday.
The allegations were made during the first day of public hearings held by Mr
John Magill, the council's district auditor. The hearings follow his
provisional findings announced in January that six councillors and four
council officials should be surcharged Pounds 21.25m for their part in
alleged 'gerrymandering' of council house sales.
A group of Labour councillors and local residents who objected to the policy
claim that council homes in eight marginal wards were sold off to bolster
the Conservative vote in the 1990 local elections.
Mr Andrew Arden QC, representing the objectors, told the hearing that Mr
Graham England, the housing director, took notes of a working lunch on June
30 1986 which was attended by four leading councillors, including Dame
Shirley Porter, the then leader.
He said Mr England's notes of the discussion included references to
'economic justification for gerrymandering on housing', 'who is a Tory
voter', and 'but will company lets vote Tory?'
Mr Arden said: 'This is an extraordinary, bizarre and frankly improper
conversation to be recorded by a director of housing.'
Mr England is one of the 10 individuals provisionally recommended for the
surcharge.
Mr Arden also quoted from a series of interviews with councillors and
officials which had been carried out by Mr Magill during his four-year
investigation. He said that these interviews showed that the council was
being run as a 'triumvirate' by Dame Shirley, Mr Barry Legg, her chief whip
at the time and now Conservative MP for Milton Keynes SW, and Mr David
Weeks, her then deputy.
He quoted an interview with Mr Anthony Prendergast, a long-serving
Conservative councillor, who said that after the 1986 local elections the
council was being run by a 'cabal' which told the backbenchers what to do.
Mr Arden said the interviews showed that the result of the May 1986
election, in which the Conservatives' majority was reduced to four, had
given them a 'great shock'.
He also focused on a set of notes made by Mr England on June 24 that year,
this time of a special meeting of chief council officials which was
addressed by Dame Shirley, Mr Legg, and Mr Weeks.
Mr England recorded that one of the objectives of the Tory majority group
was 'social engineering including housing'.
Mr Arden said the respondents would 'no doubt' argue about this term in the
coming weeks of the hearings, but he said their arguments would not be
well-founded.
He said a council should serve those who already lived there, not 'select
the electorate they wish to serve'.
He added that a council should not 'bribe people into an area by selling
them discounted housing or push people out either'.
Dame Shirley, who contests the charges, appeared at the hearings but did not
speak. Before entering she told journalists: 'This is not justice.'
She said the shouts of protesters outside the hearings showed that she had
been 'judged guilty before this inquiry'. Once inside the hearings, held in
the council's chamber on London's Marylebone Road, she laughed when Mr
Magill said: 'I have reached no decision adverse to any individual.'
The hearings continue today and are expected to last for about six weeks.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Abbey chief urges flexible savings policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The savings policies and loans offered by high street banks and building
societies must become more flexible in order to reflect social changes, Lord
Tugendhat, chairman of Abbey National, said yesterday.
Highlighting the extent to which recent profit improvements had been the
result of lower provisions for bad debts rather than sharply higher
earnings, he suggested that future growth could be more difficult to find in
traditional markets and products.
He said the shrinking of the younger age groups and the rise in the number
of older people would mean a drop in first-time buyers entering the housing
market, with a growth in demand for savings. This could mean 'a new
challenge to keep both sides of the balance sheet matched and growing'.
Job insecurity and a greater emphasis on the need for women to be
financially independent - arising partly from a higher level of divorce -
were features which financial services organisations would have to take into
account.
Against this background, he said that lenders should design mortgages which
gave borrowers more flexible commitments - including the repayment terms -
and should develop more accessible savings products which reflected
consumers' reluctance to undertake regular repayments.
This could mean mortgages where customers could vary repayments for part of
the loan within certain limits, or could choose a loan with an interest rate
changeable within certain limits.
It could also lead to changes in the endowment policies linked to mortgages
which might take more account of the prospect that they might not be
maintained for the full-term.
Other changes he identified were that people would regard their homes more
as a source of capital, and that they would become more aware of the
benefits of hedging their risks.
Delivering the Gilbart lecture, Lord Tugendhat also restated his view that
mutual financial organisations - such as building societies - lacked
sufficient accountability to their members. Abbey National, one of the
biggest mortgage lenders, was a building society until it converted to plc
status.

Union leaders agreed yesterday on a united approach to try to persuade
Korean industrial group Samsung to recognise a union at its new Pounds 450m
Cleveland electronics complex.
The northern region Trades Union Congress executive agreed at its monthly
meeting that the TUC, on behalf of all member unions, should approach
Samsung.
Union leaders in the region hope that the company, which expects to employ
3,000 people at its Wynyard complex, will agree to the recognition of a
single union, in the way Nissan did when it selected Sunderland as its
European car plant site a decade ago.
The collective approach is intended to avoid a union free-for-all.
The unions said they had worked closely with the team of agencies which
helped win the Samsung project. The progressive local approach to labour
relations had, they said, been a contributory factor in Samsung's decision.
Initial indications from Samsung are not encouraging for the unions. There
is no union at the company's television plant in Billingham, Cleveland.
Mr Walter Measor, general affairs director of Samsung Electronics
Manufacturing UK, said: 'We don't believe a union is necessary.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Ex-BCCI chief given 11-year prison term

Mr Swaleh Naqvi, former chief executive of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, was sentenced to 11 years and three months imprisonment in
the US yesterday for his role in the multi-billion dollar fraud at the
collapsed bank.
He was also ordered to pay Dollars 255.4m (Pounds 161.6m) restitution.
The sentence, which was handed down at a federal court in Washington, was
the maximum permitted under a plea agreement worked out between Mr Naqvi's
lawyers and the US Department of Justice.
It makes Mr Naqvi the most senior BCCI officer yet jailed over the fraud.
However, the sentence will be reduced by the three years and one month Mr
Naqvi has already spent in detention in Abu Dhabi and the US.
The Justice Department said it would apply for a further reduction if Mr
Naqvi assists with its investigations into BCCI over the next year.
Mr Naqvi pleaded guilty in July to three criminal charges of fraud and
conspiracy at BCCI, which was closed by international regulators three years
ago. He admitted he engaged with other BCCI executives in a racketeering
conspiracy secretly to control several US banks.
Mr Naqvi will face additional charges in New York tomorrow when he is due to
be arraigned before a state court there. Prosecutors acting for Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, are pushing for a further,
higher sentence.
The move is seen in part as an attempt to force him to help with their own
inquiries into the BCCI affair.
Mr Joseph diGenova, Naqvi's lawyer, said his client has already given
considerable help to a number of investigators since being being sent to the
US by Abu Dhabi five months ago. These include the Federal Bureau of
Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service and the Immigration and
Naturalisation Service, he said.
Mr Naqvi has also been interviewed before two federal Grand Juries in the
past three weeks, in Atlanta and Washington.
One investigator who has followed the BCCI case from its inception said that
these Grand Juries were weighing whether to indict junior BCCI employees,
implying that the Justice Department has halted investigations into whether
outsiders, including prominent figures in the US, may have aided in the BCCI
fraud.
However, Mr diGenova said Mr Naqvi was helping with inquiries into several
people outside the bank, including some who resided in the US.
Jim Kelly adds: BCCI creditors have agreed to accept Dollars 1.8bn in
compensation from Abu Dhabi, a creditors' spokesman said in London
yesterday.
Mr Tony Scott of the British-based BCCI Depositors Protection Association
(DPA) said creditor committees in Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands and
Britain, where the collapsed bank was registered, had now accepted the
offer.

<TEXT>
The US Justice Department confirmed yesterday it had launched an
investigation into allegations dealers on the Nasdaq stock market illegally
fixed their prices to profit at the expense of investors.
The investigation follows the publication earlier this year of two academic
studies which claimed to have found evidence Nasdaq dealers had secretly
agreed to keep spreads - the difference between the price at which they buy
and sell shares for investors - unnecessarily wide in order to maximise
their profits. Ater the studies the spreads on leading stocks were halved.
Nasdaq is the second largest stock market in the US after the New York Stock
Exchange, listing the shares of such well known companies as Apple Computer
and Microsoft, and under its system investors buy and sell stocks at prices
quoted to them by dealers.
The wider the spread between the buy and the sell price, the more money the
dealers make on each trade.
Since the studies were published earlier this year, more than a dozen
class-action lawsuits have been filed alleging that Nasdaq dealers - among
them some of Wall Street's biggest names - violated US anti-trust laws by
alleged price-fixing practices. Yesterday's announcement is the first sign
that the government is looking into the matter.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq, said
yesterday that it had not been contacted by the Justice Department, and said
that it was 'standard procedure' for the department to follow up on
class-action lawsuits, which NASD described as 'baseless'.

FT  20 OCT 94 / US trade deficit narrows to Dollars 9.7bn in August
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit for goods and services narrowed 13 per cent to Dollars
9.7bn in August from Dollars 11.2bn in July, but the merchandise trade
deficit was the second largest since July 1987 at Dollars 14.3bn, though
down 10 per cent from Dollars 15.9bn in July.
US exports of aircraft and capital goods helped boost foreign sales of goods
and services for the month to a record Dollars 59.8bn, up from Dollars
56.3bn in July. Imports rose too, but more slowly, from Dollars 67.5bn to
almost Dollars 69.6bn.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said substantial jumps in exports
of aircraft, motor vehicles and parts were 'rebounds from unusually low
levels in July related to planned shut-downs in some aircraft and auto
plants.'
He said the growth trend in exports 'reflects both the underlying
competitiveness of the US export sector and accelerating recoveries in some
of our major trading partners. In particular, our goods trade deficit with
Western Europe declined by Dollars 748m in August.'
For the first eight months of 1994, the trade deficit rose by 51 per cent
over the same period a year ago - from Dollars 47.76bn to Dollars 72bn. Any
significant improvement will require a narrowing of the bilateral deficit
with Japan.
Instead, the gap has continued to rise, hitting Dollars 41.9bn during the
first eight months of the year, compared with Dollars 37bn during the same
period of last year. US officials have been warning Japan for months the
deficits are 'politically unacceptable.'
Any slowdown in the US economy next year could produce calls for import
curbs on Japan from the new Congress. Mr Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist
with Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, attributed the
rise to record volumes of imports and 'only a limited acceleration' of US
exports to Japan.
'Earlier predictions of a decline were incorrect because they did not factor
in that the US cannot produce many of the products it buys from Japan and
that Japanese companies are not raising dollar prices in proportion to the
strong yen,' he said.
Deficits were also recorded with China (Dollars 3.2bn) and western Europe
(Dollars 1.6bn).
Merrill Lynch economists yesterday predicted improvement, saying: 'Europe
and Japan are coming out of their slumps and should grow faster than the US
next year for the first time since 1990. That should lead to rising US net
exports and a shrinking US current account deficit.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Canada looks to big spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, has given notice hefty public
spending cuts will be the prime tool to reach the Liberal government's
deficit-reduction targets.
He told the House of Commons late on Tuesday he was determined to cut the
federal budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the fiscal
year ending March 31 1997, from 5.4 per cent this year. 'It is a target we
will meet, come hell or high water,' Mr Martin said.
The target implies a reduction in the budget deficit from a projected
CDollars 39.7bn (Pounds 18.7bn) in the current fiscal year to about CDollars
25bn in 1997. Mr Martin estimated the government needs about Dollars 3.1bn
in spending cuts or tax increases next year and another CDollars 6.3bn in
1996/97. He plans specific proposals in his next budget, due in February.
The budget is seen as a critical test for investor confidence in Canada.
Together with Italy and Sweden, Canada has the heaviest debt burden among
industrial countries. Interest payments are projected to reach CDollars
47.3bn this year, over a quarter of total federal spending.
Financial markets are likely to focus on Ottawa's willingness to take the
axe to federal social programmes, which consume about one-quarter of this
year's CDollars 166bn budget, and on transfers to the provinces for health,
welfare and education, totalling CDollars 27bn.
The government published a discussion paper on sweeping social-security
reform this month. It contained few specific proposals, but it has run into
strong criticism and Mr Martin's cabinet colleagues may be less enthusiastic
about painful and unpopular cuts.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Where Haiti's rulers are made or broken: If Aristide is to
stay in power, he will have to win the devastated countryside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Haiti's newly reinstated President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is going to
stay in office, the politics of his survival will have to be played out
largely in the country's devastated rural areas.
Seventy-five per cent of Haiti's population live in the countryside, where
successive governments have used their control of land tenure, especially in
the rice-producing Artibonite valley where nearly all the country's
irrigated land is located, to enrich their supporters.
President Aristide is expected to nurture his constituency there too, but
his still sketchy agricultural policy and the skewed rural economic patterns
caused by military rule and the international economic embargo will make it
difficult. The military government, which held power for the past three
years, virtually abandoned the valley, preferring to make money from
controlling both legal and contraband rice imports.
Before the military, Francois 'Papa Doc' and later his son Jean Claude 'Baby
Doc' Duvalier siphoned off the spoils of the valley into their paramilitary
force, the Tontons Macoutes and set off a migration of peasants into the
shantytowns of the capital, Port-au-Prince. There they formed the backbone
of the popular organisations that spearheaded Baby Doc's downfall in 1986.
Although Baby Doc had initiated a World Bank-designed economic reform
package in 1982, import permits were still needed for rice and other grains
and were difficult to obtain. However, the government that replaced him, led
by General Henry Namphy, under pressure to be recognised by the US and
maintain the flow of foreign lending, opened the country to rice imports,
setting off a guerrilla rice war of roadblocks and shootouts.
By the time of Father Aristide's election in 1990 rice imports from the US
were worth Dollars 39m (Pounds 24.6m) annually and satisfied a quarter of
domestic demand. The peasant groups involved in this rice war were the main
supporters of the lavalas (flash flood) movement that swept Fr Aristide to
power.
According to some of his rural supporters, President Aristide lacked a
coherent agricultural policy and therefore the country remained open to rice
imports, hurting lavalas's ability to transform itself into a workable
governing coalition.
'The Artibonite is where you make or break a government in Haiti,' says Mr
Anil Juste, an agronomist and historian of the valley. 'If you can control
the production and distribution of rice you can control the country.'
But President Aristide will find controlling the valley an awesome task.
Land disputes are ongoing and violent, as no one knows who has the right to
farm what plots and there is no working system of land titles. The
government owns most of the land but has in the past rent it for nominal
sums to powerful allies who in turn rented tracts to local peasant
sharecroppers. Some plots changed hands as many as three times a year and
planting an area did not guarantee the right to harvest it.
'The first thing people will do when the embargo is lifted and the price of
cement falls is build walls around land they control but do not necessarily
own.' says an agricultural official. 'Aristide may try to help the peasants
through credits and such but land reform is out of the question. How do you
know what land to give away if you don't know what land you have?'
Annual rice production has fallen from 125m tonnes during Fr Aristide's year
in office to less than 80m tonnes since the embargo was imposed. The
emergency food aid that flooded the cities during the embargo have meant
that much of the rice produced in the valley had no market, according to
officials at the World Food Programme.
In an effort to jump-start production, the Inter-American Development Bank
has earmarked more than Dollars 17m for rehabilitation of the irrigation
system in the Artibonite, while the World Bank has a long-term project to
map the area to settle land disputes.
In return, international lending agencies are expecting that President
Aristide, as he has publicly pledged to do, will keep the country open to
food and other imports. Tariffs on legally imported rice will be cut in half
'for a transitory period' until being eliminated altogether, according to
the Aristide economic plan approved by lending agencies.
There is a consensus among agricultural economists that even as Haiti
increases its rice production it will need to maintain rice imports to feed
its population.
'There is a vacuum of agricultural policy that will be filled quickly by the
World Bank and the IADB,' says Mr Juste.
He says the productive programmes of the multilateral institutions can help
construct democracy in Haiti only if they put a premium on helping small
producers while breaking the grip of landholders who have become accustomed
to making money off rents and political power rather than from producing
food.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Hamas raises terror campaign to new pitch in Israel: The
attacks have now come to dominate the political agenda of both Yassir Arafat
and Yitzhak Rabin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The devastating bomb attack on a bus in Tel Aviv yesterday marks the
increasing confidence and power of Hamas, the militant Islamic group, which
has pledged to destroy the peace process, the state of Israel, and usher in
an Islamic republic based on Koranic law.
An anonymous caller told Israel radio that the bombing had been carried out
in the name of some 400 Hamas activists expelled by Israel for several
months to a no-man's land in Lebanon in December 1992. He said he wanted to
thank the government for deporting the Hamas members where they had received
training in sabotage and explosives. 'We know how to carry out attacks and
we will carry out other attacks,' he said.
The threat is very real. In the past fortnight, Hamas has struck a new level
of terror into the heart of Israeli society; spraying a busy Jerusalem
shopping promenade with bullets and killing two people; kidnapping and
killing a 19-year-old Israeli soldier; and carrying out yesterday's attack
in the commercial centre of Tel Aviv.
Its increasingly successful military campaign against Israeli civilians and
soldiers has come to dominate the political agenda of both Mr Yassir Arafat,
the Palestinian leader, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister.
The attacks have shown that Hamas has the political initiative and can
influence the pace of the peace process. Furthermore it has now laid down an
open challenge to Mr Arafat for the leadership of the Palestinian people and
defied him to take repressive measures at the risk of civil war.
Experts on the extremist movement, which has a growing support base of
between 20-40 per cent of Gaza's 850,000 residents, say Hamas does not want
Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin to suspend the peace process.
Rather their strategy is to cripple it, thereby ensuring that Mr Arafat
fails to deliver on his promises to his people of new jobs, alleviation of
poverty and a gradual assumption of legitimate Palestinian rights. These
include the return of Israeli-occupied land, the right of return of up to 4m
Palestinian refugees and the establishment of an independent state, with
Arab East Jerusalem as its capital.
Each time Hamas carries out an attack Israel seals off the Gaza Strip,
preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from travelling to their jobs
inside Israel. Last week Israel briefly suspended peace talks following the
kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Such moves play into the hands of Hamas
by showing Palestinians how weak Mr Arafat is, and how dependent on Israeli
goodwill.
Israeli demands for Mr Arafat to smash the military wing of Hamas are also
easily exploited by the Islamic group as Mr Arafat doing Israel's dirty work
for them. Last week's mass arrests of Hamas activists in Gaza by Mr Arafat's
security forces were met with demonstrations and riots, accompanied by
threats of civil war. Hamas's military wing warned Mr Arafat that if he
continued arresting its supporters it would reply 'by setting the Gaza Strip
ablaze'.
Hamas continues to benefit from the very limited gains Palestinians have
reaped from the peace process and the poor performance so far of the
ineffectual Palestinian authority. Like other militant Islamic groups, Hamas
thrives on despondency, poverty and the failure of secular Arab governments
to restore pride and economic wellbeing to their peoples.
Many Palestinians feel Mr Arafat gave up the Palestinian struggle in return
for a virtual bantustan in a part of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town
of Jericho. Months after the PLO was supposed to have taken over the West
Bank and held elections, Mr Arafat's peace negotiators remain locked in
negotiations with Israel in Cairo.
Furthermore, after three months in power, Mr Arafat has yet to put together
a credible government capable of tackling the massive task of rehabilitating
the derelict Gaza Strip and combating an unemployment rate of 40-50 per
cent. Part of his failures are self-imposed - a result of centralisation of
power and an aversion to transparent government. International donors,
choking on their own bureaucracy, are also to blame for the slow drip of
promised emergency funds.
As Mr Arafat struggles to deliver real economic and political change, Hamas
continues to provide better services through its social welfare network of
schools, clinics and kindergartens. Hamas also offers a strong moral message
and a religious certainty in a period of upheaval and instability.
In a recent interview, Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a leading Hamas spokesman in Gaza,
said his organisation welcomed the return of Mr Arafat to Gaza because his
obvious failures would expose the moral, economic and political bankruptcy
of secular Arab government and encourage Palestinians to turn to the Islamic
solution. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he
said.
But it is not just Mr Arafat's failings that contribute to the flow of
recruits to Hamas. Hatred and suspicion of Israel remain deeply rooted in
the hearts of many Palestinians. Even amongst PLO supporters, Hamas is
viewed as a 'liberation organisation', fighting a legitimate battle against
continued Israeli occupation of their land and denial of their rights.
Mr Arafat will now come under renewed pressure from Israel to deal a
decisive blow to Hamas. For Israel, peace means increased security. During
last week's kidnap crisis Mr Rabin said: 'Arafat must choose between making
peace with Israel or making peace with Hamas'. It is an acute dilemma for Mr
Arafat, while still trying to find his feet as leader of a people in a
nascent state. If Mr Arafat does not move against Hamas he risks allowing
Israel to continue dragging its feet in talks and so ensuring the vacuum
which Hamas so readily exploits.

Mr Derek Hanekom, South Africa's land minister, yesterday announced the
withdrawal of authorisation for land transfers to leaders of the former
black homeland of Lebowa who had allegedly bought large amounts of
state-owned land for personal use. The move was a response to claims on
Tuesday that tens of thousands of hectares of land in the former homeland
had been privatised and handed over to tribal chiefs immediately before last
April's elections, when Lebowa was formally reincorporated into South
Africa. The money used to pay for the land allegedly came from a special
government fund that had been budgeted for drought relief for local farmers.

ensuring the UN embargo on Iraqi oil sales remains in place, a senior
Kuwaiti official said yesterday. Mr Abdul Rahman al-Houti, chairman of
Kuwait's public authority for assessing compensation, appealed to countries
holding Iraqi assets to transfer 30 per cent of the funds to the UN
compensation commission so that urgent claims can be paid. The commission,
meeting this week in Geneva to assess claims from those forced to flee
Kuwait and property claims below Dollars 100,000, has paid out less than
Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) so far. Total claims to the Commission amount to
nearly Dollars 170bn, including Kuwaiti claims of over Dollars 102bn.

<TEXT>
Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Australian Reserve Bank, yesterday
foreshadowed another increase in interest rates as a way of maintaining an
underlying rate of inflation of 2-3 per cent for the rest of the financial
year 1994-95.
'I am confident appropriate adjustments will be made in monetary policy that
will deliver a 2-3 per cent underlying rate of inflation,' he told a federal
parliamentary committee. Mr Fraser also said the government could do better
to reduce its forecast budget deficit for 1994-95. The budget has estimated
a deficit of ADollars 11.7bn (Pounds 5.8bn) for the year, representing 2.5
per cent of GDP. He warned a better performance on the fiscal side did not
reduce the need to tighten monetary policy when necessary. A strong jobs
growth reported last week had intensified pressures on the government to
raise interest rates. More than 75,000 new jobs were created in September,
reflecting an acceleration in economic activity.

FT  20 OCT 94 / NTT moves to find access deal: Company president hopes lines
issue can be settled in 10 days
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NTT, the Japanese tele-communications group, said yesterday it was willing
to connect its domestic lines with other carriers, opening Japan's market to
fresh competition.
However, NTT's president, Mr Masashi Kojima, told a news conference
negotiations with new carriers on cost-sharing and other issues were still
needed before the lines were connected.
The NTT president made his announcement a day after one of the new carriers,
Japan Telecom, a competitor in the long-distance market, requested
government intervention to resolve a two-year-old dispute over opening up
the network NTT dom-inates for high-speed data services.
Mr Kojima said he hoped the issue could be settled within about 10 days,
without involving the minister of posts and telecommunications. He told
journalists: 'NTT has said to all operators that its basic stance is that it
is willing to connect its lines to every operator if there are such
requests.'
Japan's main newspapers had devoted many column inches to the dispute
yesterday, with analysts saying that the dispute stemmed from NTT's monopoly
of the domestic telephone network and that the lack of progress added weight
to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' argument for breaking up
NTT.
'It's useless to prolong such troubles any more,' Mr Kojima said, referring
to the row with Japan Telecom.
'We hope we can settle the issue soon, possibly within 10 days, without
troubling the minister of posts and telecommunications.'
Mr Kojima said NTT and Japan Telecom could not agree on line connections
during two years of negotiations because NTT hoped to establish broad rules
on line connections, including cost-sharing, before dealing with specific
demands.
'This is because we expect various demands (on line connections) from
various operators, like cable television and virtual private network (VPN)
operators,' Mr Kojima said. 'But we would eventually connect with them, as
the world's trend is for hooking up lines with various operators. Networking
companies won't survive if they move against this direction.'
Since October 1992, three long-distance carriers - Japan Telecom, DDI Corp
and Teleway Japan - have been trying to persuade NTT to connect their lines
with NTT's local leased circuits for corporate use.
The operators want to use the circuits for a new and cheaper digital data
transmission service called 'frame relay services'.
NTT currently monopolises the domestic telephone network, although it has
the three companies competing with it in the domestic long-distance market.
The status of NTT, which is majority-owned by the Finance Ministry, will be
reviewed in the year starting April 1995, when a five-year law governing
NTT's status is to expire.
In the past 10 years, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has made
two attempts to break up NTT but failed due to opposition from political
circles.

FT  20 OCT 94 / China slows reforms in fight to check inflation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China is for the moment slowing the pace of economic reform while it seeks
to bring inflation under control and head off possible social unrest,
Chinese officials told a meeting of the World Economic Forum yesterday.
Senior Chinese officials, including Mr Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, indicated that a need for stability was
preoccupying the leadership, which he said had made the anti-inflation fight
its most important priority for the rest of the year.
A World Economic Forum official said after the two-day session organised by
the Swiss-based consultative group and attended by government and business
leaders that his impression was that the Chinese had entered a 'period of
pause. For the moment, what concerns them is taming inflation. They feel
they need a period of slower growth rather than starting a new phase of
reform.'
China's State Statistical Bureau announced on Tuesday that the cost of
living nationwide was 27.4 per cent higher in September than the same month
last year. Economic growth for the past two years has averaged over 13 per
cent. Growth of 11-12 per cent is forecast this year. Beijing introduced
price controls last month on staple foodstuffs in an effort to break the
inflationary cycle. Food prices have risen sharply in the past year.
The World Economic Forum official noted that reformist impulses in Beijing
had been subdued in comparison with last year, when Chinese officials were
discussing ambitious plans for reform of the banking system and state
enterprises. 'Now,' the official said, 'there is a mood of consolidation and
caution.'
Officials had deflected questions about plans to force state enterprises
into bankruptcy under a pilot programme announced earlier this year and
meant to target some 100 faltering enterprises in 18 cities. The authorities
have been reluctant to bankrupt enterprises because of fears of social
unrest among laid-off employees.
Government economists estimate that of the 11,000 large and medium state
enterprises, about one-third are in the red. Another one-third barely break
even. The State Statistical Bureau says that in the first nine months of
this year, some 44.5 per cent of state enterprises have made losses.
State-owned enterprises have been hard hit in an austerity programme begun
last year and aimed at calming the economy. Many enterprises are starved of
working capital and some have problems paying employees.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Manila acts to tighten liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The monetary authorities in the Philippines are moving to tighten liquidity
in the financial system to keep inflation within targets prescribed by the
International Monetary Fund.
The move follows the visit of Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director,
during which an excess of nearly 8 per cent in the money supply target was
discovered.
Under the IMF-supervised economic programme approved on June 24, reserve
money (currency in circulation, plus deposits and reserves kept by banks
with the central bank) was targeted at 148.7bn pesos (Pounds 3.7bn) for
September, in line with an inflation rate target of 8.5 per cent by
end-1994.
A review conducted late in September found that reserve money had reached
some 106.5bn pesos, nearly 8 per cent over target. Inflation, which had
risen to 9.9 per cent in August, slipped to 8.6 per cent in September.
Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance secretary, pledged to Mr Camdessus to bring
down the liquidity level, but did not cite any specific reason for the
surge. Analysts said the increase was being traced to the spate of initial
public offerings on the local stock market and the refusal of some banks to
roll over placements in Treasury bills on expectations of a new rise in
interest rates.
Mr Camdessus, at the end of his visit on Tuesday, told officials the economy
had been performing well, with a first-half growth rate of 5.1 per cent, but
'continued vigilance' was needed against a resurgence of inflation. An IMF
team, originally due in Manila in late November, is now being asked to delay
its review to December.
The authorities appear confident of meeting the end-October reserve money
ceiling of 162bn pesos under the IMF programme without fuelling any big
increases in rates.

   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistani police and other investigation agencies were last night closely
monitoring the security situation in the city of Karachi, where three days
of violence this week have left at least 29 people dead.
Among the dead, 16 belonged to rival factions of the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi
Movement), an ethnic party of Urdu-speaking immigrants from India, which
split in a power struggle more than two years ago. The other 13 victims
included three policemen.
The larger faction of the MQM has been involved in a bitter power struggle
with members of a breakaway group which formed a separate party last year.
Members of the two factions have been targeting each other in sniper attacks
and ambushes, in an effort to establish their authority in the city.
While the larger faction of the MQM still appears to have the support of a
large number of people, it is not clear if either of the two sides is
gaining ground decisively.
Efforts by the Pakistani government to negotiate an end to the violence have
so far produced no results.
But the killings have once again sparked fears among the city's businessmen,
worried that security fears will deter investors away from Karachi.
Senior officials say privately that at least part of the violence has
resulted from the involvement of unemployed, educated youth.
The city has Pakistan's fastest growing population living in slums.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Gunmen burst into an oil camp in eastern Algeria on Tuesday night and killed
the only two Europeans there, officials and diplomats said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Tunis.
The deaths of the two men, a Frenchman and an Italian, bring to at least 66
the number of foreigners killed in civil strife between Moslem
fundamentalists and the army-dominated authorities.
In Rome, the Italian foreign ministry said a Somali was also killed at the
camp near Tebessa, operated by Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company.
But in Algiers, an Italian embassy spokesman said he could not confirm this.
The two Europeans worked for Schlumberger, a French company, which named the
Frenchman as Philippe Hetet, 36, and the Italian as Mauro dell'Angelo, 30.
The company said in Paris: 'There were four employees at the site. They were
attacked by a group of armed men. Two of the employees were killed.'
The first foreigners were killed in September last year, shortly before the
fundamentalist Armed Islamic Group (GIA) warned non-Algerians to leave the
country or be killed.
The GIA, one of several groups battling to overthrow the authorities, sees
foreign workers as supporting the government and the economy.
Italy's foreign ministry said the attackers burst into one of the oil
company's buildings, set fire to it and told the Algerian nationals to flee.
They then killed the others.
Last week, gunmen shot dead a South Korean businessman near his home in
Bordj el-Bahri, about 25km east of Algiers.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Vietnam wobbles on the capitalist fast-track: The party old
guard signals its concern about unbridled reform as national assembly
convenes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the World Cup football semi-final was taken off Vietnam's state-run
television channel in July and replaced with a eulogy to the dead North
Korean leader Kim Il-sung, it was a clear sign that Vietnam's communist old
guard was beginning to stir.
Hardline politburo member Nguyen Duc Binh apparently ordered the change from
his hospital bed while reformist prime minister Vo Van Kiet was on a trip to
Ho Chi Minh City in the south.
While the change of programme irritated Vietnam's football lovers, more
fundamental tensions between reformers and conservatives are expected to
emerge over the next 10 days as Vietnam's National Assembly convenes a
landmark session in the capital, Hanoi, starting today.
Inflation, a swelling budget deficit and a review of the last four years of
virtually unimpeded foreign investment are expected to top the agenda.
Hanoi-based diplomats say the session could also yield a handful of
ministerial reshuffles reflecting the fact that officials are starting to be
made accountable for economic mismanagement as Vietnam undergoes adjustment
of its once centrally planned economy along market lines.
They say a prime candidate for demotion is finance minister Ho The, widely
blamed for failing to check a swelling budget deficit and making promises of
central government funding to provinces that were never fulfilled.
'He's ripe for sacking,' said one veteran economist and government adviser.
'He's made some very contradictory decisions.'
Vietnam reacted nimbly to the sudden disappearance of aid in 1989 from its
main benefactor, the former Soviet Union, achieving remarkable success in
slashing annual inflation from four-digit figures to a respectable 9.9 per
cent. The country's staple exports of crude oil, rice, coffee and rubber
have helped maintain a much-needed flow of foreign exchange. Incomes,
particularly in the cities, are rising fast. Foreign investment has poured
in, reaching a total contracted amount of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) last
month.
But this year there was an alarming rise in imports in the first six months,
resulting in a trade deficit of Dollars 200m. Other disappointing economic
statistics have soured the optimism of the past two years, fuelling
conservative calls for a re-assessment of doi moi, the term used to refer to
the economic reforms officially sanctioned in 1986.
Diplomats say the news has worried government planners and fractured the
previous fragile consensus among policy-makers that the pace of reform
should quicken.
Other signs of hardening attitudes include the banning last week of a
collection of short stories on the grounds that a prize-winning story was
infringing 'the policy and religious faith and national solidarity of the
party and the government'.
What worries the conservatives - understood to include Communist party
secretary Do Muoi - is the potentially damaging social consequences of some
market reforms and the possible erosion of the party's position.
'They're saying (reform is) the worst of all worlds,' said one economist.
'It's seen as representing the devaluation of 'socialist orientation',
uncontrolled foreign investment and too much domestic business.'
Diplomats and local economists say that the future direction of reform could
hinge on the tenor of Mr Kiet's opening speech to the national assembly.
'It's probably the most difficult speech he'll have to make,' said the
economist.
Mr Kiet is understood to be keen to push through the rubber stamp assembly
higher growth, increased reform of the banking system, further restructuring
of lumbering state-owned enterprises and increased mobilisation of the
private sector.
The mood at the session is likely to be sombre. A press release issued last
week by the standing committee of the assembly rapidly dispensed with the
glowing rhetoric of previous years.
Deputy prime minister Phan Van Khai, an avowed reformist, was reported in
the local press as having warned the standing committee of the national
assembly last week at a preparatory meeting of 'very heavy duties in the
rest of the year'.
Foreign investors say a sign that some sort of re-assessment was imminent
has been uncertainty in the last four months over whether any more foreign
banks would be licensed to operate branches in Vietnam. 'No one is sure
about the pace of progress,' said one investor, who requested anonymity.
Vietnam has allowed branch licences to nine banks. US banks Citibank and
Bank of America are believed to be on top of a waiting list of about 20
hoping for branch status.

Thailand has put instant coffee on a list of products subject to price

multinational, that foreign investors would take offence at such a backward
step on the road to free enterprise. Nestle, whose Thai subsidiary Quality
Coffee Products has more than 80 per cent of the local instant coffee
market, angered the government by raising prices by 10 per cent in July and
by refusing commerce ministry demands to reverse the price increase. This
week the cabinet authorised the ministry to put instant coffee on the list
of controlled consumer products. It had been removed two years ago along
with 100 other products as part of an economic liberalisation drive.

The US Trade and Development Agency yesterday offered Mr Alexander
Vladislyavlev, the chairman of Zil, the Russian limousine maker, assistance
with restructuring but warned that, until this took place, planned joint
ventures between the Russian vehicle manufacturer and western companies were
in jeopardy. Mr Vladislyavlev, accompanied by Zil shareholders, yesterday in
Washington met representatives of US government agencies, the World Bank,
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Overseas
Development Agency, and the Fund for Large Enterprise Restructuring.
Also present were representatives of two US companies - Caterpillar of
Illinois and Seattle-based PACCAR - which have signed four joint venture
deals signed with Zil. The TDA has offered to help Zil devise an overall
restructuring plan, an effort which would take at least a year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Brussels outlaws shipping 'cartel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday outlawed the Trans-Atlantic Agreement
(TAA), a shipping 'conference' which set cargo rates and capacity levels
across the North Atlantic, because it infringed its competition rules. This
decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement had
led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for the
15 large shipping lines which set up the agreement in 1992. The ruling is
however only the first stage in resolving this dispute because the
shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the Trans-Atlantic
Conference Agreement (TACA) in July. Earlier this month they made a further
concession by offering to remove capacity constraints from the TACA.
A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British
Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling
established an important principle which would have implications for similar
conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa.
If the TACA is also rejected there could be a return to lower transatlantic
shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued this route in
the late 1980s. Members of the TAA include P&amp;O, Maersk, Nedlloyd, AP Moeller
and Hapag-Lloyd.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan could become the first major Asian textile producer to agree to
open its markets to foreign exports of textiles and clothing, Mr Mickey
Kantor, the US trade representative, said yesterday.
Praising a tentative agreement reached between the US and Pakistan, Mr
Kantor said the 'landmark agreement. . . represents the first time in at
least two decades that US textiles and clothing will be permitted in
Pakistan'.
In response to exporters' demands the US has been pushing for market
openings in India, China and other Asian nations more accustomed to seeking
markets in the US than opening their own. Mr J. Henry Walker III, of the
American Textile Manufacturers Institute, said yesterday's new trade
figures, showing record volumes of textile and clothing imports,
demonstrated the need for market openings in India and China.
The tentative pact calls for Pakistan to remove all bans on the import of
fibres, yarns, fabrics, home furnishings and clothing by July 1 1995.
Tariffs would be lowered over a 10-year period to levels no higher than 10
per cent for many key US yarns, 20 per cent for many fabrics and carpets, 30
per cent for home furnishings and 35 per cent for clothing.
Pakistan has also agreed to eliminate prohibitions and duties on the export
of raw cotton, which the US textile industry says has resulted in
artificially low cotton prices in Pakistan. This gives cotton spinners and
weavers 'an unfair competitive advantage'.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Chrysler in Dollars 100m plan for Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Vietnam Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer, is planning a Dollars 100m joint
venture in Vietnam to build minivans and possibly four-wheel drive vehicles.
The venture would be the first by a US carmaker since the lifting of the US
economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year. The negotiations come as
other international vehicle makers are considering projects in the country,
in spite of difficulties in finding local partners with experience in the
industry.
Mr Robert Eaton, the Chrysler chairman, arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday to meet
Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister, and the transport and heavy industry
ministers to discuss the project. The company's interest in Vietnam follows
an early entry into the China market, where production of the Beijing Jeep
began in September 1985.
In May, Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a
joint venture in Vietnam, quickly followed in June by Renault, the French
state-owned group, which signed a letter of intent to begin car assembly in
the country.
BMW, the German carmaker, has a contract to assemble cars in Vietnam and
Mercedes-Benz hopes to do the same.
Vietnam is eager to avoid domination of its motor industry by one country
and has yet to decide how it will divide up shares of the motor assembly and
manufacturing industry.
In Chrysler's case, industry sources suggest that the joint venture partner
is most likely to be a division of the heavy industry ministry rather than a
Vietnamese motor manufacturer. Until two months ago, Chrysler was pursuing
negotiations with Mekong Corporation, a three-way venture between Japan,
Korea and Vietnam, to build a four-wheel-drive vehicle.
However, the deal apparently fell through when the Korean partner made clear
it was unwilling to relinquish sufficient equity control to Chrysler.
Since then, the US company has been hunting for other partners, determined
to set up some sort of facility in Vietnam. It was reported yesterday that
the company had already decided on a site for the venture.
If Chrysler wanted to sell domestically it would have to find a way round
recent foreign currency regulations stipulating that revenue from any
product sold in Vietnam must be in dong, the local currency, which is not
freely convertible.
As an emerging market, Vietnam is viewed with great interest by several
leading vehicle makers. Less than 5 per cent of the country's 72m people
drive cars.

venture next month to build a 400MW power plant in Indonesia. The company is
in talks with Bakrie Brothers, a private Indonesian telecommunications and
plantations group and has agreed the venture in principle. However,
financing has not yet been agreed. British Gas may hold less than 50 per
cent of the plant, which will begin construction early next year. The plant
will be designed, built and operated under British Gas management. British
Gas already has a number of activities in Indonesia, where offers
significant potential for power demand is expected to rise 14 per cent a

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asian governments at the World Infrastructure Forum in Jakarta yesterday
called on private investors to take a leading role in financing ambitious
plans for development of their transport and telecommunications sectors.
Indian officials said that by 1997 their country wants to achieve its target
of allocating telephones on demand, a programme requiring investment of more
than Dollars 8bn. 'This is beyond the capacity of the government funding and
generation of resources,' he said. 'Private investment and associations of
the private sector would be needed in a big way to bridge the resource gap.'
The officials said that for the telecommunications sector to play its
assigned role in the country's development, it needs to increase its
telephone connections to 60m from the present 8m 'as rapidly as possible'.
That will require an estimated investment of Dollars 60bn.
While basic telephone services are still lacking, Indian officials said they
are also inviting private investment to set up value-added services. A
tender is being prepared to invite technical and financial help in setting
up cellular mobile phone services outside the main cities of Bombay, Delhi,
Calcutta and Madras.
Indonesia said it needs Dollars 12.5bn over the next five years to develop
transport infrastructure, including roads, railways, inland waterways, sea
port facilities and airport facilities. Indonesia also announced plans to
invest more than Dollars 1bn by the year 2005 on water projects in Jakarta.
Of this, Dollars 200m would be spent on distribution improvements alone.
'Under these circumstances, efforts should be made to encourage and
stimulate private sector participation,' an Indonesian official said.
Some 44 per cent of the requirement for Indonesian transport infrastructure
development is expected to come from the private sector. The remainder is
expected to come from state-owned companies, the government and foreign
loans.
The Indian government yesterday announced it is tendering for nine projects
amounting to 167km of a high-speed tram system in the Delhi area. It is also
offering projects on a build-operate-transfer basis for five bypasses, with
an estimated cost of Dollars 70m, eight bridges which will cost about
Dollars 147m and nine express-ways costing an approximate Dollars 3.5bn.
The Philippines listed 175 potential projects worth over Dollars 14bn which
are likely to be tendered on a build-operate-transfer basis for highways,
transportation, power generation, water systems, tourism, industrial estates
and waste management.
The Asian Development Bank estimates that Asia needs about Dollars 3,000bn
in infrastructure investment between now and 2010 if each country is to
achieve its projected economic growth target.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: British bankers try out a royal sales
pitch
</HEADLINE>

   ST PETERSBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Behind the pomp of Queen Elizabeth's visit to Russia, British and Russian
businessmen have been getting on with the 'development of capitalism,' the
title of a seminar held on the royal yacht Britannia. Some 50 Russian
businessmen and bankers have been invited on board the yacht, moored on the
Neva River, just out of sight of the Russian cruiser Aurora where the first
shots of the Bolshevik revolution were fired.
British Invisibles, an umbrella body promoting invisible trade, had been
quick to exploit the publicity surrounding the Queen's visit to stage a
sales pitch for the virtues of British banking, legal, accounting, and
management consulting services. It was their eigth such foreign event this
year and the third occasion on which they had utilised the royal yacht.
A string of British advisers represented included Kleinwort Benson, Robert
Fleming, Clifford Chance, Freshfields, Smith New Court, Ernst and Young, and
Coopers and Lybrand.
With Dollars 500m of foreign portfolio investment pouring into Russia every
month, the British delegation said equity could provide a cheap and
effective means of raising funds to finance the growth of Russian companies.
However, they cautioned that substantial preliminary work including
accounting and legal studies would be required first.
A discussion on financing the growth of a hypothetical Russian company
sparked lively debate and highlighted the differences in business cultures.
It also emerged that some of the Russian guests had their own sales pitches
to make.
Mr Cyril Smirnov, president of Astro Bank, a large local commercial bank,
suggested that the Russian banking system could provide sufficient funding
and that companies did not need the assistance of outsiders. A university
lecturer said Russian managers needed re-education and training before they
would be up to the task.
Many of the Russian guests blanched when the subject of prospective fees was
raised. A margin of 5 to 7 per cent to raise Dollars 10m of fresh capital
clearly seemed excessive to some - no matter how much it would help fuel
future growth. An interpretation of both business cultures was put forward
by Mr Igor Kostikov, the managing director of a local stockbroking firm.
'Russian managers are reluctant to accept the loss of control that goes with
raising equity capital. But they also worry about taking on the liabilities
of corporate debt. They feel that it is enough to survive at the moment and
do not yet see the need to grow,' he said.
Sir Brian Pearse, chairman of British Invisibles, expressed cautious
optimism. 'We do not think that there can be any quick fix for Russia but we
are saying very clearly that we will be here for the long term.'

Thailand has put instant coffee on a list of products subject to price
control, prompting veiled suggestions from Nestle, the Swiss foods
multinational, that foreign investors would take offence at the move.
Nestle - whose Thai subsidiary Quality Coffee Products has more than 80 per
cent of the local instant coffee market - angered the government by raising
prices 10 per cent in July and by refusing commerce ministry demands to
reverse the price increase.
The dispute came to a head this week when the cabinet authorised the
ministry to put instant coffee on the list of controlled consumer products.
Instant coffee had been removed from the list two years ago along with 100
other products as part of an economic liberalisation drive.
'This restrictive measure applied to a non-essential product may prove
prejudicial to Thailand,' said Mr Andreas Schlaepfer, managing director of
the Thai Nestle group, 'particularly since this case has attracted the
attention of foreign investors in the region.'
He said the 10 per cent rise, the first in three years, was to offset higher
operating costs and was unrelated to rising world coffee prices. 'It's not a
monopolistic situation at all,' he said. 'There are two other factories
here, with large installed capacity and the right technology.' Businessmen
in Bangkok believe Nestle has fallen foul of the Thai government's attempts
to control inflation, which reached 5.3 per cent in September.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Ericsson rings the bell in Chinese market
 -With telecom sales doubling each year, financing expansion is a big
headache
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lars Magnus Ericsson, the founder of the Swedish telecommunications group
that bears his name, would not have been surprised at the group's success in
China. He may, though, have been puzzled that it took so long to
materialise. A 1906 photograph shows Mr Ericsson welcoming the first Chinese
delegation to the group's Stockholm headquarters. It is only now - after the
hiatus caused by the Chinese revolution - that the group's efforts to
develop the market have really started to bear fruit.
The rapid development of the Chinese telecommunications market has been a
boon for equipment suppliers worldwide - but few have benefited as much as
Ericsson. The group, which employs 1,400 in China, has seen sales in its
fastest-growing market double every year over the last three years, a feat
it hopes to repeat again this year. Last year China was Ericsson's sixth
biggest market, accounting for SKr3.8bn (Dollars 520m) of group sales of
SKr63bn.
Ericsson's Chinese business centres on three areas: AXE switches for public
networks, mobile telephone systems and office switching systems. In mobile
systems, the group boasts a 60 per cent market share, a dominance in line
with its leading global position. In fixed systems, where the leading
supplier is France's Alcatel, it claims a market share of about 20 per cent
and in office systems 30 per cent. By comparison, it is weak in mobile
handsets, which is dominated by Motorola of the US.
A steady inflow of orders over the last three years culminated in August in
Ericsson's biggest contract in China so far - a Dollars 400m contract to
extend the phone network in Guangdong province. China's most dynamic
province, Guangdong accounts for half Ericsson's sales to the country.
'We have 3.5m fixed lines already installed in China and a further 2.5m on
order,' says Mr Uldis Zervens, Ericsson's director for east Asia. On the
mobile side, the group has capacity installed or on order for 1.5m
subscribers.
Most of the equipment comes directly from Sweden. But increasingly important
are the group's joint venture colloborations in China with local partners.
Ericsson already has five joint ventures, comprising three manufacturing
units and two service companies, and more are planned.
The biggest collaboration is in Nanjing where the group produces radio base
stations for mobile systems and AXE switches with its partner, Panda
Electronics. Guangdong, Beijing and Dalian are the sites for the other four
ventures.
The Nanjing joint venture got off the ground only after nearly three years
of talks with the Chinese authorities. The decision-making involves three
tiers of government - federal, provincial and local - and up to 15 different
organisations, even though the end-customer has until now always been part
of the ministry of post and telecommunications. At the state level alone,
five different ministries are involved.
In theory the Chinese cake is big enough for everyone. In practice,
competition is tough, says Ericsson.
At present there are only about 30m fixed lines in a country of 1.2bn people
 -a penetration rate of just 2.5 per cent of the population. But the
authorities are ambitious, planning 10m new lines a year to achieve 8 per
cent penetration by 2000.
The constraint is that the enormous development potential is matched only by
the huge difficulties of financing it. Even though telecommunications is a
priority area, there are clear indications that the authorities wish to
restrict the availability of credits and guarantees for equipment supplies.
This could pose problems for companies such as Ericsson although it could
also provide an opportunity if it results in foreign operators being given
more access to the country's market.
Mr Zervens says project financing looms as Ericsson's biggest Chinese
headache. New rules of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the 25-member industrial nation grouping, mean it is much
harder to get soft loans for the development of fixed networks; at the same
time western commercial banks and credit guarantee agencies are reaching the
limits of their China exposure. One result is that Ericsson has had to
subsidise some of the loans itself.
'So far we have been able to handle this but we see it as one of the major
challenges for next year,' says Mr Zervens. He says one way around the
difficulty would be for Ericsson to take some financing risk on to its own
books, a path it has reluctantly taken with other countries in the past.
Another is for China to let foreign operators gain a foothold in the market
 -a breakthrough that came all the closer last week when Cable and Wireless
of the UK became the first foreign company to gain a concession to play a
role in operating telecom networks.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Berlusconi offers unions pension reform changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government last night held out an olive branch to the country's
powerful union movement by offering to reconsider injustices in pension
cuts.
Proposals to alter the costly state-run pay-as-you-go pensions system
provoked a four-hour general strike last Friday. More than 3m took to the
streets and union leaders have called for a huge follow-up next month in
Rome.
The attempt to re-establish a dialogue with the unions followed an all-day
meeting of leading figures in the right-wing coalition government to
consider how to eliminate hardship cases caused by the budget proposals
regarding pensions. A government spokesman said broad agreement was reached
that the changes could be amended providing any extra cost was compensated
for elsewhere. It is not clear how much the amendments might cost, but as
much as L1,000bn (Pounds 405m) could be at stake.
If the cost of mollifying the unions appears too high, the government could
be forced to raise taxes, a move always resisted by Mr Silvio Berlusconi,
the prime minister.
The prospect of changes in the budget comes only a day after Mr Antonio
Fazio, the central bank governor, warned that the government projections for
the cost of debt service in the 1995 budget were too optimistic.
The main area of hardship as far as pensions are concerned is the temporary
freeze on people being taken on to the scheme. Many people applied for early
retirement, fearing cuts in benefits by the Berlusconi government. Now they
find themselves with no prospect of a pension payment until February.
Mr Berlusconi telephoned union leaders last night to explain the thrust of
the amendments, inviting them to return to the negotiating table.
The coalition meeting is also believed to have discussed the decision by the
Bank of Italy to nominate an insider, Mr Vincenzo Desario, as
director-general - the number two job. There were reports of government
moves to censure the appointment, as a signal of displeasure at the way the
Bank of Italy asserted autonomy in choosing the candidate.
Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, meanwhile has ordered an inquiry
into complaints about the behaviour of Milan's anti-corruption magistrates.
The move comes at a moment when the higher magistrates council, the
judiciary's governing body, looks set to shelve a complaint lodged by the
government about a newspaper interview given by Mr Francesco Saverio
Borrelli on October 9 saying the investigative net was closing round Mr
Berlusconi.
The complaints are understood to cover seven separate aspects of the Milan
magistrates activities during the course of the year but mostly since the
Berlusconi government took office in May.

FT  20 OCT 94 / EU policies 'main threat to E Europe exports'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trade and industrial policies of the European Union were yesterday
singled out by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
as 'the main threat to eastern European exports and investment'.
In its first 'transition report' on the shift from centrally planned to
market economies throughout the former Soviet bloc the EBRD states, 'the
main threat to eastern European exports and investment comes from actual,
threatened and 'latent' trade remedy action employed for purposes of
managing trade to support industrial policy objectives in the EU'.
It warns of the uncertainty that such policies arouse in exporters and
potential investors and adds that so-called 'voluntary export restraints'
imposed by the EU on the former communist states 'can strengthen
bureaucracies and existing exporters at the expense of new entrants'.
At the end of May 1994, some 19 anti-dumping measures imposed by the EU were
in force along with 12 other trade restrictive measures, the report shows.
'The mere threat of limited market access may generate sufficient
uncertainty so as to reduce investment in competitive sectors,' the report
adds.
The report also criticises the Europe Agreements (EA), which are bilateral
trade agreements between the EU and individual central European countries.
By setting very high local content rules the EAs 'have investment-deterring
effects' on assembly operations in Eastern Europe which use cheap but
skilled local labour to assemble finished products incorporating parts
imported from other EA countries. They also discourage greater trade between
the former Comecon states, it says.
In spite of the hurdles that the EU continues to place in front of the
economies in transition, however, the report shows how much progress has
been made over the past five years. The private sector now accounts for more
than half of all economic activity in nine of the 25 countries surveyed and,
with the exception of Ukraine, most states have managed to avoid
hyper-inflation.
Inflation is down to low double digits in most of central Europe and the
Czech Republic is first in line to bring price rises down to single figures
this year or next. Unemployment, whose rise over the past five years has
been one of the clearest indicators of the shake-out from the Soviet-style
heavy industries and arms plants, is now starting to ease off in the
fast-track reforming states.
Foreign equity investment, which totalled only Dollars 12bn until the end of
1992, remains highly concentrated on Hungary. But the Czech Republic, Poland
and other states with restructured economies and growing domestic markets
are attracting growing volumes of investment.
Set against the benefits of greater choice of goods, the end of queueing and
shortages and greater employment freedom, however, are negative social
factors such as the growth of crime, more social and job insecurity and
rapidly widening income differentials.
On the evidence garnered from the 25 highly diverse former centrally planned
economies in which the EBRD now operates, the most important elements
conducive to a successful transition have proved to be 'transparency of
government action, macro-economic stability and progress in privatisation,'
Mr Nicholas Stern, the EBRD's recently appointed new chief economist said.
Other important factors include progress in taxation reform, with the
introduction of VAT and graduated personal and corporation income taxes, and
financial market and bank reforms.
The report indicates a growing split between the group of central European
countries closest to EU markets, quickest to adopt macro-economic
stabilisation and micro-adjustment policies, and the slower, more distant
parts of the former Soviet empire where reform started later from a less
culturally prepared base.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, the Baltic states and
Slovenia have made most progress to date. In these countries the decline in
production which followed market reforms and the collapse of the Comecon
markets is over. Poland, the first to bite the bullet of macro-economic
stabilisation in 1990, was the first to return to growth in 1992. But all
are now in the early stages of what should be a prolonged rise in
production, investment, foreign trade and income. Official statistics, still
biased towards the declining state sector, under-record the real rates of
income and output growth, the report adds.
The EBRD identifies an intermediate group, including Kyrgysztan and Russia,
which has made 'spectacular progress' in privatisation but remains far
behind in financial sector reform and enterprise restructuring.
Beyond lie Ukraine and several other Commonwealth of Independent States
members which have been slow to embark on monetary and other essential
structural reforms and reluctant or unable to privatise. Growth here is not
likely to resume until around 1996.

FT  20 OCT 94 / US ready for unilateral end to arms ban: White House move
highlights differences in Bosnia policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Willy Claes, Nato's new secretary-general, yesterday insisted that
serious differences with the United Nations over air tactics in Bosnia could
be bridged in spite of the failure of talks in New York this week.
However, trans-Atlantic tensions over policy towards former Yugoslavia were
fuelled by a statement from the White House that the US was prepared to defy
its allies and take unilateral action to authorise arms supplies to Bosnia.
Mr Claes told Nato ambassadors in Brussels that his hopes of a compromise
with the UN rose after a telephone conversation with Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, UN secretary-general.
Nato, under strong pressure from the US, is demanding the right to make more
draconian use of its aircraft over Bosnia. It wants the right to carry out
air strikes more rapidly, and without prior warning, in response to any
provocations by the Bosnian Serbs.
The British and French commanders in charge of UN ground troops in Bosnia
insist that they are the best judges of how to protect their own men and
humanitarian convoys in the war zone.
In support of the case for caution, they have pointed out that children were
playing in the area where Nato aircraft struck a Serb tank last month.
Instead of the current procedure, under which UN commanders specify exactly
which target the Nato aircraft should aim at, the Atlantic alliance wants
its pilots to be given a range of at least four targets.
Talks in New York on Monday revealed big differences between General
Bertrand de Lapresle, the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, and senior Nato
officials.
However Mr Claes - in one of his first diplomatic initiatives since taking
over Nato's top job - said he had ironed out some of the problems in a
telephone talk with Mr Boutros Ghali.
Diplomats said there was room for compromise over the issues of how much
warning of impending air strikes to give the Serbs and the selection of
targets.
Yet the prospects for international co-ordination over Bosnia were clouded
by a statement from the White House that President Bill Clinton might act
alone in authorising arms deliveries to Bosnia's leadership.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said the US was lobbying for a UN
resolution lifting the embargo but added that if that 'doesn't succeed by
November 15 . . . then we would look at ways to perhaps lift the embargo
unilaterally.
'Our preferred position has been a multilateral lift,' she said. 'We
certainly are going to pursue doing it multilaterally, working with our
allies, particularly countries that have troops on the ground.'
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, defended the UN's decision not to
call in air strikes after a shooting incident in eastern Bosnia this week in
which the driver of a UN aid convoy was killed.
He said ground forces had made a 'vigorous' response by firing back at the
convoy's attackers. This demonstrated that 'there were other means
available' besides air power as a response to provocations.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Polish privatisation back on track
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Waldemar Pawlak, Poland's prime minister, yesterday removed one of the
last obstacles to the long delayed mass privatisation programme by approving
around 100 companies for inclusion.
The decision, which brings the number of companies to be transferred to the
private sector at one fell swoop up to 460, has been awaited by the
privatisation ministry since July.
Poland had promised both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
that the plan would go ahead. Both institutions, worried about the fate of
the programme, had insisted it be implemented before freeing funds to
finance the recent agreement to cut cut Poland's commercial debt by 49.5 per
cent.
Mr Pawlak, who heads the Polish Peasant party, junior partner in the
government, has argued that the plan gives too great a role for foreign
managers and includes too many plants in key sectors.
The previous government approved 360 companies more than a year ago. About a
dozen companies were removed from the present tranche before the prime
minister signed it.
The government plans to establish around 15 national investment funds
(NIFs), run jointly by foreign and local managers, which are to be handed
equity in the 460 companies. Shares in the funds are then to be distributed
to the population at large for a nominal fee. Next year's budget assumes
that income from the fees will run to 4,000bn zlotys (Pounds 108m).
Fund managers for the programme have already been shortlisted and these
include Kleinwort Benson, Barclays de Zoete Wedd and Charterhouse, as well
as Polish banks and local consultants.
The next step is for the government to establish the NIFs formally and
appoint supervisory boards which will then chose management groups.
The funds are to stay in existence for 10 years, with managers paid an
annual fee as well as a performance bonus in NIF equity and cash at the end
of the period. The aim is to privatise the companies as well as improve
management, modernise plant and generally enhance their value.
The scheme has become an indicator for international financial institutions
and investors of the government's intentions on privatisation. It leaves
abother 5,000 or so companies to be privatised including sensitive sectors
such as petrochemicals and telecoms.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Milan's anti-corruption magistrates face inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alfredo Biondi, the Italian justice minister, has ordered an inquiry into
a series of complaints made about the behaviour of Milan's anti-corruption
magistrates.
The move comes at a time when the higher magistrates' council, the governing
body of the judiciary, looks set to shelve a complaint lodged by the
Berlusconi government over a newspaper interview given by Mr Francesco
Saverio Borrelli on October 9. In the interview Mr Borrelli said the
investigative net was closing round Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, and he also attacked Mr Biondi.
The complaints are understood to cover seven separate aspects of the Milan
magistrates' activities during the course of the year but mostly since the
Berlusconi government took office in May. Two of the complaints concern the
conduct of investigations into the activities of Berlusconi's Fininvest
business empire.
The first incident relating to Fininvest was the very public search of its
offices on March 9 and attempts to secure the arrest of top Fininvest
managers before the general elections. Mr Berlusconi complained at the time
that the action was politically motivated.
The second complaint was about the inquiries into the ownership of Telepiu,
the cable TV channel 10 per cent owned by Fininvest. Mr Fidele Confalonieri,
Fininvest chairman, has complained this is a vindictive effort to smear
Fininvest's name rather than a serious inquiry.
'The desire to put all the complaints against Milan together and to carry
out this investigation just when the higher magistrates' council is moving
to shelve the Borrelli affair does not seem to be a correct use of
authority,' said Ms Elena Paciotti, head of the magistrates association.
While the government appeared determined to open a new front in their
long-running confrontation with Milan magistrates, the right-wing coalition
yesterday signalled its readiness to soften its position on another - cuts
in pensions contested by the trades unions.
The government held a day-long meeting of all key members of the coalition
and economic ministers to find an agreement on concessions to be made to the
unions. Mr Berlusconi signalled in advance his willingness to make changes
in the plans for pension reforms. But he insisted any changes involving
extra spending would have to be compensated by alternative cost-cutting
measures.
The populist Northern League and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance have
pressed for amendments to ease hardship cases. The government has been
obliged to soften its stance on pensions after the widespread observance of
last Friday's four-hour general strike, which saw more than 3m persons
demonstrating in the major cities up and down the country.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French prime minister's call for a political ceasefire among fellow
conservatives yesterday drew a tart response from several of his
presidential rivals, with Mr Jacques Chirac spurning a bilateral truce.
Mr Edouard Balladur had invited Mr Chirac, the leader of his own RPR
Gaullist party, and ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of his UDF
coalition partner, to discuss ways to help unite the conservative government
and parliamentary majority 'with a view to the presidential election'.
Yesterday, Mr Chirac made it clear that he was not going to answer any
summons from Mr Balladur before convening top leaders of the RPR, which he
dominates, to discuss the strains that presidential rivalries are placing on
the government. A close Chirac aide, Mr Eric Raoult, complained yesterday
that Mr Balladur was trying to gag Mr Chirac's supporters while giving free
voice to his own.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing yesterday claimed that his UDF federation was not to
blame for the recent political ructions, implying he had nothing to discuss
with Mr Balladur.
Mr Balladur's appeal for presidential campaigning to be delayed until the
New Year looks likely to go unheeded, partly because his rivals see it as
self-serving.

FT  20 OCT 94 / French coal mining set to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Charbonnages de France (CdF), the state monopoly producer of coal, said
yesterday it was confident of winning the support of a majority of unions
for its plan to abandon mining entirely by the year 2005. Only 10 per cent
of miners in the main Lorraine coalfields heeded a strike call on Tuesday by
the left-wing CGT trade union. French coal mining has been in rapid decline
for some time, and CdF - which had 41,000 employees producing 18.5m tonnes
in 1986 - now produces only just over 10m tonnes with 16,000 employees.
Under last July's government plan, which is only opposed by the CGT out of
the five unions represented at CdF, employees can take redundancy money or
stay on at CdF, which after 2005 will continue to run its electricity
generating plants with coal imported from outside Europe. The latter is half
the real price of French coal which is heavily subsidised, though the
government is making a start to the planned phase-out of domestic mining by
slashing this year's subsidy from FFr6.4bn (Pounds 770m) to FFr4.4bn next
year.

The European Commission has approved an Italian government aid package to
help steelmakers in the Brescia region restructure. The Commission said in a
statement the Ecu410m (Pounds 323m) plan would add 5m tonnes in capacity
cuts to the 11m already achieved as part of an EU-wide rescue package for
the European steel industry. The EU has demanded 19m tonnes of capacity cuts
by November 8 for the overall package to go ahead. The Commission said the
Italian plan involved L600bn in aid to help close down steel mills in the
Brescia region and L190m to help re-employ redundant workers. The Italian
plan is a revamped version of a package earlier deemed by the EU to breach
its aid rules.

Monaco has signed an accord with France to co-ordinate efforts against money

open communication between Trackfin, the French agency responsible for
tracking laundered money, and Siccfin, its equivalent in Monaco. It follows
similar agreements signed between France and other countries including the
US, Australia, Belgium and Italy over the past few years. Siccfin was set up
last year following the introduction of a banking law in line with
international guidelines designed to clamp down on money laundering.

Turkey and central Asia's Turkic republics yesterday ended a two-day summit
in Istanbul with pleas for negotiated settlements to regional conflicts and
improved trade and infrastructure links. Leaders from Turkey and the five
Turkic states of the former Soviet Union signed a declaration reaffirming
the need for regional political consultation but did not mention Turkey's
earlier idea of creating a Turkic federation reaching from the Mediterranean
to China.
They were also careful not to antagonise Russia, insisting that the summit
was not an attempt to undermine the CIS. Moscow has criticised Turkey's
attempt to strengthen its presence in the region, but President Suleyman
Demirel said his objective was 'not to create a sphere of influence but a
zone of co-operation'. Representatives from Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey emphasised instead the need
to strengthen trade links and improve the region's poor transport
infrastructure. They said a new Silk Road should be built to connect the
region's markets. Turkey also used the forum to press that the proposed oil
and gas pipelines between the Caucasus and Europe should cross its territory
rather than Russia.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Kuchma wins reform vote

<TEXT>
Ukraine's parliament yesterday endorsed, by a surprisingly wide margin,
President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform programme. The vote suggests the
Communist-dominated parliament will not for now spoil the first attempt at
real reform in the depressed former Soviet republic. Mr Kuchma now has the
chance to implement the tough macroeconomic steps required to secure
Ukraine's first Dollars 360m credit from the International Monetary Fund,
which due to approve the loan next week. Before then, Ukraine must unify
currency exchange rates and liberalise prices, among other reforms. Nine
decrees are awaiting Mr Kuchma's signature, say advisers.
Initial steps are likely to stoke inflation and further devalue the unstable
currency. But the IMF credit, a interest rate and foreign aid - to be
discussed at a special meeting in Canada next week of the Group of Seven
industrial nations - would help offset the devaluation. Price
liberalisation, covering coal and natural gas, also would enable the
government to reduce subsidies to close the 1994 budget deficit to 10 per
cent of gross domestic product.

<TEXT>
Social Democrats in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are
determined to keep open the option of forming a government with the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the reformed communists, in spite of strong pressure
from the federal SPD leadership to form a grand coalition with the ruling
CDU, state officials said yesterday.
The SPD won 29.5 per cent of the vote, giving them 23 seats in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Sunday's state election, just above the PDS, which
won 22.7 per cent and 18 seats. The CDU, which won 37.7 per cent of the vote
and 30 seats, formed the last government in coalition with the Free
Democrats but the FDP failed to get re-elected to the state parliament.
Mr Harald Ringstorff, leader of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's SPD, has been told
by the party's federal leadership to start coalition talks with the CDU. 'We
will start talks with the CDU tomorrow,' an SPD spokesperson said. 'But if
we do not succeed, we will keep the door open to the PDS despite pressure
from Bonn.'
The SPD federal leadership has since June tolerated the SPD/Green coalition
in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, whose minority government relies on
the support of the PDS, but it is unwilling to allow formal coalition with
the former communists.

FT  20 OCT 94 / The long wait and high cost of a small transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Few services offered by European banks have been of as low quality as their
transfers of small sums of cash across borders. As the European Commission
recognised in proposing legislation yesterday, it not only costs a lot to
send cash, but takes a long time.
Money transfers are traditionally done by banks sending money to
'correspondent' banks in the destination country. The correspondent bank
transfers it to the appropriate account - usually at another bank  - via the
automated clearing house which is used for domestic payment transfers.
In some countries, this can take an extremely long time. In Italy in the
1980s, foreign banks were told that it would take a standard 28 days to
clear a payment. Although standards have improved markedly, some banks are
happy to delay the clearing of cash to gain interest.
Banks had little incentive to compete for such business - and raise
standards - until recently. There are relatively few transfers of small sums
 -defined as up to Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,870) - within the EU. They account
for only 0.8 per cent of total domestic payments in the UK, and 4 per cent
in Belgium.
The view among most banks was, as Mr Tim Sweeney, director general of the
British Bankers Association, put it this week, 'that old British response:
'there's no call for it, guv''. This meant that banks displayed little
urgency either in making payments or raising standards.
Some of the results could be seen in the study carried out for the European
Commission earlier this year which found that banks charged an average
Ecu25.4 to make an urgent transfer of Ecu100, and the money took an average
of 4.15 working days to reach the destination bank and be cleared.
The study found widespread double charging - the receiver of the cash is
charged as well as the sender. This occurred in 36 per cent of urgent
transfers. Customers were also given inadequate information, with only 21
per cent of branches giving an accurate guide to transfer times.
This led to the commission losing patience after a three-year effort to
raise standards. The decision to proceed with legislative action is a
setback for Mrs Christiane Scrivener, commissioner for consumer affairs, who
argued that a voluntary code of conduct would be more suitable.
But Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single
market, argued successfully that legislation was a necessary step to help
consumers and small businesses to take full advantage of the 1992 programme
for the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
The proposed EU directive must be approved by a qualified majority of EU
ministers, by the end of 1996 at the latest. Customers will have to have
accounts credited with the sum transferred in six days; there must be full
disclosure of costs; and double-charging will be banned.
European banks mounted a strong lobbying campaign against legislation. Ms
Diane Iannucci, the official responsible for payment systems at the European
Banking Federation, yesterday argued that small banks might withdraw
services and that efforts by large banks to raise standards could be
disrupted.
Despite the results of the commission's study - which the federation says
are flawed - there is evidence that banks are at least starting to improve
standards. Several partnerships have been formed among European banks in the
past two years to provide more efficient transfers.
These include a partnership between National Westminster Bank of the UK,
Commerzbank of Germany and: Societe Generale of France; and another among
Lloyds Bank of the UK, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya of Spain and Credit Agricole of
France. Girobanks and Co-operative banks have also formed payment links.
The commercial bank effort which has gone furthest is the Inter Bank On-line
System (Ibos) developed jointly by Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco
Santander, which offers virtually instantaneous and relatively low-cost
transfers between accounts at banks which are members of the system.
Such services have started to develop because banks have seen efficient
cross-border payments as a means of drawing in small businesses who operate
increasingly across borders. But yesterday's decision shows that the impact
of such initiatives has been too slow to hold the commission back.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Brussels urges wider trade zone: Proposal would link EU with
its North African and Mideast neighbours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday called on the EU to create a
Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area with its North African and Middle Eastern
neighbours, to establish the biggest free trade zone in the world, and help
stabilise the Union's southern and eastern flanks.
Brussels wants the EU to devote aid worth Ecu5.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) in 1995-99
to lay the ground for this project, and raise Mediterranean policy to near
the same strategic importance as east and central Europe, which should get
around Ecu7bn over the same period. The EU's eastern neighbours currently
receive nearly five times more aid than the states to its south and east,
officials say.
June's summit of EU leaders in Corfu invited the Commission to come up with
a new 'southern' strategy, which Brussels now hopes will be endorsed by
December's Essen summit.
Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner in charge of relations with the EU's
Mediterranean neighbours, said that 'in broad terms, what we would be
offering is something like the EEA' - the 1993 European Economic Area free
trade zone between the EU and the European Free Trade Association (Efta).
The main difference would be that whereas four of the seven members of Efta
 -Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - are poised to enter the Union next
year, membership would not be on offer to Euro-Med partners.
The target countries are the Maghreb and Mashraq states (Morocco, Tunisia,
Algeria, Libya; and Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon) and Israel. Relations
with Cyprus, Malta and Turkey remain inside the context of eventual
membership negotiations.
The Commission argues that it is essential to 'rebalance' the EU's
relationships with its neighbours, now weighted towards bringing six central
European states into the Union around the end of the century. Germany, in
particular, has used its current presidency of the EU to put in place the
building blocks of this 'eastern' strategy.
This was underlined by yesterday's visit to Brussels by Mr Laszlo Kovacs,
Hungary's foreign minister, who underlined his government's wish for full
Hungarian membership of the Union 'before the end of the century,' with
accession talks starting in 1997.
In Mr Marin's view, 'the only country which can launch a realistic attempt
to rebalance Europe's relations with its neighbours is Germany; we think the
German presidency understands that.'
France's EU presidency in the first half of next year is expected to host a
Euro-Med ministerial conference to begin establishing the economic
modernisation, trade access, and mutual security priorities of the new
policy. The French, moreover, will be succeeded by two Mediterranean
presidencies of the EU - Spain and Italy - under whose stewardship the
strategy should be finalised.
A full free trade zone, senior Commission officials said, would take 10-15
years to establish, by which time up to 40 countries encompassing 800m
people could be involved. Officials say the transformed prospects for Middle
East peace, plus growing instability and migratory pressure in the Maghreb,
have prodded the EU in equal measure to review its policy.
They add that any substantial boost in aid will inevitably be tied to
commitments from the EU's southern neighbours to help control illegal
migrants and illicit drugs coming into Union territory.
'Many countries will insist that if we're going to provide around Ecu5bn
then drugs and immigration control must have a central part, without doubt,'
Mr Marin said.
The commissioner also argues that it is important to move now, before
southern EU member states become over-nervous about next year's enlargement
to the north, and the planned expansion to the east, and the consequent
shift in the Union's centre of political gravity
Southern EU states prefer aid to trade concessions for North Africa and the
Middle East, while their richer northern partners take the opposite view, Mr
Marin observes, arguing for a synthesis as 'an antibody to North-South
disintegration'.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: French industrial output rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
French industrial production rose 2.3 per cent in July and August compared
with June, according to figures released yesterday by Insee, the national
statistics office. The increase was stronger than expected by private
economists and eased fears of a slowdown in France's recovery from
recession. Insee traditionally puts data from July and August together
because many companies close for summer holidays. Figures from the period
are treated with caution because of a high level of seasonal adjustment.
None the less, the figures, showing a year-on-year increase of 5.2 per cent
in industrial output and a 6.9 per cent rise in manufacturing output,
appeared to confirm official predictions of continued healthy growth. John
Ridding, Paris
German producer prices rose 0.2 per cent last month, after remaining
unchanged in August. Producer prices rose 0.6 per cent year-on-year.
Dutch non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rose to an average of 484,000 in
July-September (7.6 per cent of the labour force) from 421,000 (6.6 per
cent) a year ago.
Swedish retail sales rose 0.3 per cent in August compared to August 1993
after a 4.7 per cent decline the month before.

<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to improve drinking water in the EU, mainly by eliminating more lead,
could cost member states more than Ecu50bn (Pounds 39m), a draft Commission
document reckons. 'The estimated potential investment costs of the proposed
changes in the (drinking water) directive are almost entirely associated
with the change of the (limit) value for lead,' the draft proposal says.
'These costs could be of the order of Ecu50bn.' But 'it will be for member
states to decide to what extent individual householders should replace lead
pipes within their property,' the text says, adding that they could be given
15 years to bring their water up to scratch. According to Commission
estimates France's bill could be as high as Ecu44.5bn and in England and
Wales the costs could run to Ecu10.7bn. The draft proposal keeps the
existing limit for individual pesticides but scraps a limit on the
cumulative total. The European environmental bureau, which groups 150
environmental groups from 23 European countries, attacked the decision.

FT  20 OCT 94 / European banks expect telephone services to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost all the banks in Europe which have not already developed telephone
banking facilities are planning to do so within the next six years according
to a survey published today, writes Alison Smith. A poll by Datamonitor, the
market research group, found that 65 per cent of banks already offered
telephone banking and a further 30 per cent of total respondents were
planning to provide such a service.
Across 12 European countries, the target markets seen by banks for the
telephone service were primarily those in the 25-44 age group.
Beyond that core, however, banks in different countries diverged more
significantly in their target markets. Those in Austria, France, Germany and
Sweden, for example, saw the 18-24 age group as the third target area, while
banks in Finland, Ireland, Spain and the UK cited the 45-54 age group as
more of a priority.
The 83 banks which responded to the survey expected increasingly to provide
general insurance, mortgages, personal loans and financial advice over the
telephone where they did not do so already. The poll found that telephone
banking had penetrated the retail banking market most extensively in Sweden
and Belgium, and made least impact in Italy and Portugal.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Israel firm on peace despite blast: Rabin promises tough
measures after 22 die in Tel Aviv bus attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   TEL AVIV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel insisted that the Middle East peace process would not be halted by a
suicide bomber's attack on a commuter bus in Tel Aviv yesterday that left 22
people dead and 45 wounded.
The 9am rush-hour attack by Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel, suggests
that the militant Islamic group is intensifying its campaign of violence.
The bombing has further divided supporters and opponents of peace among both
Israelis and Palestinians.
Last night Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said he would take
tough measures against Hamas. Mr Rabin, who cut short a visit to Britain
after the worst attack on Israelis in 16 years, indicated he would propose
measures to cabinet today that would displease human rights groups. He
warned that the families and homes of suicide bombers would not be safe.
President Bill Clinton said the bombing was 'an outrage against the
conscience of the world' and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, condemned
the attack and offered to help track down those responsible.
Mr Arafat's statement highlighted the growing tension between the PLO and
Hamas, which has mounted an open challenge to his authority and vowed to
'set Gaza ablaze' if the PLO continued arresting its members.
Israel immediately sealed off the Gaza Strip and West Bank, preventing tens
of thousands of Palestinians travelling to their jobs in Israel. Later, 18
Israeli demonstrators were arrested in Jerusalem and an Arab's house was
reported to have been set on fire in the West Bank.
However, Mr Ephrahim Sneh, Israel's health minister, said the PLO peace
talks would not be halted:  'We will continue the day and night war against
terrorism. We will fight them and defeat them and kill them, but we are not
going to grant Hamas the political victory of stopping the peace process.'
The blast came two days after the initialling of a peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan, which had raised hopes that political barriers were
falling in the Middle East. A signing ceremony is due to be held next week,
and Mr Clinton has said he will attend.
Israel's opposition rightwing political parties furiously criticised the
government in parliament. Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, Likud party leader, said Mr
Rabin was responsible for allowing Gaza to become 'a terrorist haven to
prepare murderous deeds'. He demanded the construction of a fence around
Gaza.
Hamas, which last week kidnapped and killed a 19-year-old Israeli soldier,
warned of more attacks and said yesterday's bombing had 'lifted the spirits
of the Palestinian people'.
The bomb blast created carnage and destruction in one of the busiest
shopping streets in cosmopolitan Tel Aviv, known for its cafes and
boutiques. Bodies, severed limbs, shredded clothes and possessions were
strewn across the street near the city's main shopping mall and crushed
under the smoking wreckage of the commuter bus.
Witnesses said some of the dead had been sitting at outdoor cafes or walking
along the street. The bomb threw up flames 40 feet high. 'There was a huge
blast and I was lifted off my feet,' said Sarah Pal, in a second-storey
apartment opposite the blast. Angry residents gathered, chanting anti-Arab
and anti-government slogans. 'We don't want Arabs to come to our city,' said
Daniel Minis. 'Gaza must be closed and Rabin should get out.'
In a sign of the deep sense of national tragedy, Israelis, for the first
time, hung black flags from their balconies - a regular Palestinian mourning
ritual.
Prof Yona Alexander, a terrorism expert based in Tel Aviv, said the attack
underscored Hamas's message that it had 'a long arm and could decide where
and when it is going to strike'.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Brussels plans law to aid cross-border money transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday overrode opposition from the banking
industry and proposed legislation to make it easier, cheaper and quicker for
small businesses to transfer money across borders.
The decision marks the end of a long campaign to persuade European banks to
improve their performance in the transfer of small-value payments - those of
under Ecu10,000 (Pounds 7,894) - through self-regulation.
The Commission still hopes banks will enact the measures voluntarily,
although it is setting a deadline of December 1996 for EU ministers to pass
the legislation.
The proposals from Brussels would ban double charging - cases where banks
charge customers for receiving cash as well as for sending it - and require
banks to provide detailed, written information on services to customers.
Money would have to be credited to the recipient's account within six
working days, unless the customer and originating bank agreed it could take
longer. A study this year showed 85 per cent of transfers met this target.
Mr Raniero Vanni D'Archirafi, commissioner responsible for the single
market, said yesterday the Commission had little choice but to legislate
because banks had not done enough to reduce the costs of cross-border
payments.
There were 170m of these transfers a year and the number could triple by the
year 2000, he said. It was vital to reduce costs for small businesses
operating internationally and show the European public that the single
market was working.
However, the European Banking Federation said action had been taken on the
basis of a 'flawed' study carried out this year for the commission. It said
smaller banks were likely to stop offering services if legislation was
enacted.
Ms Diane Iannucci, the official responsible for payment systems at the
federation, said larger banks were working on partnerships to speed up
transfers and reduce costs, and these could be disrupted by legislative
plans.
The commission's study found that Europe's businesses and customers pay an
average Ecu25.4 per Ecu100 cross-border payment, Ecu2 more than they paid a
year ago. The average total time for a transaction is almost five working
days.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner who initially supported a
voluntary code of conduct, hailed the proposed legislation. We could not put
up with this situation for ever; at some point we had to act,' she said.
Mrs Scrivener urged ministers to agree legislation as soon as possible.
Internal market ministers will consider the proposal at a meeting in
Luxembourg in October 31.
The originating bank would be liable if a payment was not made on time,
although it could shift responsibility by mutual agreement with others.
Customers would be able to claim the money with interest if the deadline was
not met.
The Commission wants full disclosure of the costs of cross border
transactions to customers; but it does not prescribe maximum charges because
this could encourage cartels and run foul of competition law.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Government poised to lift ban on Adams' visits to mainland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is poised to lift the exclusion orders banning Mr Gerry Adams
and other prominent Sinn Fein members from visiting the British mainland.
The move is likely within days and would be part of the government's staged
response to the IRA ceasefire in Northern Ireland.
The decision may be agreed at a meeting of Mr John Major and cabinet
colleagues today. Ministers will use the meeting to conduct a detailed
stock-taking of the situation in Ulster after last week's loyalist
ceasefire.
London is considering opening a 'reversible' dialogue with republican
leaders. Senior ministers have come to recognise that they may never be
given an unequivocal pledge that the IRA ceasefire is permanent.
Ministers have acknowledged that such talks could be under way by Christmas.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said last week that the
loyalist ceasefire made it harder for the Provisional IRA to return to
violence.
Moderate unionists, whose support for the peace process is vital, are not
expected to object to an early move to lift the exclusion orders since many
see them as a denial of the union's integrity.
The exclusion order against Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, was made last
October under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, refused to revoke it in January.
The ban was referred to the European Court of Justice in July, with European
judges asked to lay down legal guidelines on the competing interests of Mr
Adams' right to move freely within the European Union, including the UK, and
the government's right under European law to take action against him in the
interests of national security.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Treasury to cut one in four senior staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury yesterday announced a far reaching shake-up of its structure
and operations, which will involve the loss of about one in four senior
staff.
The number of senior posts will be cut from 99 to 72 while a new
departmental structure, involving seven divisions instead of nine, will be
created.
The plans will have a knock-on effect on staffing levels throughout the
Treasury, and are likely to increase pressure in Whitehall to reduce senior
posts and reshape other departments.
The changes are also designed to stop the Treasury from 'second-guessing'
other government departments on small items of expenditure. Instead, it
should focus on the strategic issues which determine the long-term trend of
public spending.
Under the reforms, the Treasury would transfer some of its duties, such as
the supervision of Civil Service personnel management and pensions, to other
government departments.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has suggested that the Treasury's
economic forecasting function might also be subject to government's market
testing programme and put out to competitive tender in two years.
The proposed changes follow a management review, overseen by Sir Colin
Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, and form part of the government's
fundamental review of public spending, started early last year.
The Treasury reforms are planned for implementation in April next year. A
further reduction in senior staff posts from 72 to 68 is planned by 1997-98.
However, senior staff numbers will fall by slightly less than the number of
posts, since staff will be given longer between jobs to prepare for their
next posting. The Treasury hopes to achieve the cuts with voluntary
redundancies but did not rule out compulsory lay-offs.
Although many of the departing staff can look forward to well-paid jobs in
the City, on top of redundancy packages, the review is causing disquiet
among Treasury officials. Some believe the ability of the Treasury to do its
job will be undermined.
Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association which
represents senior civil servants, described the proposed cuts as 'drastic'.
She said: 'The worry is that the Treasury will not be able to do the job it
is charged with doing.'
The report's authors admit that 'we have little doubt that the immediate net
effect on morale is likely to be adverse'.
Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary, addressed staff yesterday about the
proposals. The Treasury, which has budgeted running costs of Pounds 81m in
1994-95, gave no indication of the likely savings from the review.

FT  19 OCT 94 / People: Salomon Brothers boosts energy sector coverage by
board appointment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers has boosted its presence in the energy sector by poaching
David Cockburn from Lehman Brothers, where he has been head of European
Energy and Natural Resources since 1989.
He is to be director of investment banking in London, with responsibility
for the energy sector in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the former
Soviet Union.
The firm said yesterday that it also plans to take on another analyst for
the sector before the end of the year.
Cockburn will be a senior member of Salomon Brothers' global energy and
chemicals group, which provides capital-raising and advisory services to
clients in Asia and Latin America as well as Europe and North America.
A graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, he began his career in 1978 as a
lawyer at Slaughter &amp; May, before joining Schroders in 1984, where he was
responsible for energy financing.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: DnB plans to set up life
insurance group
</HEADLINE>

   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, yesterday announced plans
for a life insurance company to become operational in 1995.
Norwegian commercial banks were given the green light by the Storting
(parliament) in the spring of 1992 to establish insurance companies
providing they are granted a concession from the finance ministry.
DnB said it hoped to submit an application for such a concession within the
next week.
The bank also disclosed that it would cancel a co-operation agreement made
in 1993 with Vital, the Norwegian life insurance group, in which DnB sells
life insurance products through its bank distribution network.
DnB said it intended to sell life insurance products to companies and
private individuals and the new company would be one of Norway's most
cost-effective - enabling it to offer competitive products.
The bank declined to reveal the size of the life insurance company.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Peugeot finds a PAL in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Peugeot is to sign a joint venture agreement today with Premier Automobile
Ltd (PAL) to establish a manufacturing operation in India for the French
motor group.
The project has ambitious objectives to produce 60,000 vehicles a year by
1998 and to capture 10 per cent of the Indian car market by 2000. The
investment over the next four years is expected to total FFr1.2bn (Dollars
220m).
Peugeot said the project, one of a series of investment plans in India by
international vehicle groups, reflected the strong growth potential of the
market. He said the Indian car market was growing by about 15 per cent a
year and should reach about 270,000 cars in 1994. By 2000 sales were
expected to reach 500,000 cars.
Under the agreement, the joint venture, dubbed PAL Peugeot will be
controlled by the French and Indian partners. They will both hold about 28
per cent of the shares, with the balance held by institutional investors and
the public through a share issue on the Bombay stock exchange.
The joint venture will produce the five door version of the Peugeot 309, a
medium-sized vehicle. The cars will be manufactured at PAL's Kalyan plant,
50km north of Bombay. The first 309s are expected to leave the production
line next year, with volumes steadily increasing over the following three
years. The joint venture agreement includes the re-tooling and modernisation
of the Kalyan plant, which currently produces the NE118, a small car which
uses Nissan engines. In the first year of the project, Peugeot estimates
that between 5,000 and 6,000 309s will be built, with a local content ratio
of about 15 per cent. The proportion will rise to about 80 per cent by 1998.
The 309 will be a rival to the small cars produced by Maruti, the dominant
player in the Indian car market, which has partnerships with Japanese
manufacturers. Competition is expected to intensify as other international
groups, including Ford and General Motors, start production in India.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Armscor begins policy of openness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRETORIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's state arms company, Armscor, under official scrutiny for a
Middle East arms sales fiasco, said yesterday it would publish details of
arms purchases for the first time, Reuter reports from Pretoria.
Armscor issued a written monthly bulletin of defence products sought by the
South African military and listed the companies awarded contracts. 'This is
giving transparency to a critical aspect of the acquisition programme,' said
Mr Andre Buys, Armscor's planning division chief.
Companies approved to bid for defence contracts will also be able to have
access to an electronic bulletin board updated daily with information on
defence purchase requirements. The bulletin 'will list all the major product
and service requirements of the National Defence Force for which possible
contract opportunities exist at both main and sub-contract level'.
Armscor's chief executive, Mr Tielman de Waal, said the bulletins were also
available to foreign defence contractors.
The state-owned corporation said the lifting of international arms sanctions
against post-apartheid South Africa made possible the new openness.
Armscor's previous activities had been shrouded in secrecy to protect its
often clandestine acquisition of foreign defence equipment.
The activities of Armscor, which licenses arms sales, came under fire this
month when the sale of rifles and quantities of ammunition to a shadowy
Lebanese arms merchant turned sour.
The justice minister, Mr Dullah Omar, appointed a three-man commission to
investigate South African arms sales.
Asked if Armscor proposed the same sort of openness in weapons sales as it
announced for its purchases, Mr Buys said
South Africa was considering contributing to the UN register of world arms
sales. 'The whole question of arms control is being investigated.'

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Beijing and Washington have agreed to increase the frequency of their
military consultations in a further sign of improving relations.
The move follows President Bill Clinton's decision earlier this year to
sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said
in Beijing that the two sides would enhance their military contacts in a
series of regular high-level briefings which would begin next month.
The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with the briefings, he
added. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr Perry
told reporters after meeting China's prime minister, Mr Li Peng.
Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less secretive.
'We pointed out that transparency can reduce the concern of China's
neighbours that its modernisation programme could provide a threat,' Mr
Perry declared.
'I was very clear that we were not looking for secrets. It's strategy,
budget and broad planning where we are looking for an exchange,' Mr Perry
said.
The US had also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its
nuclear tests. The purpose had been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying
out tests. China drew protests from western governments on October 7 when it
detonated a nuclear device at its Lop Nor test site.
Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on testing,
but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes into
effect in 1996. Mr Perry made it clear his visit to China was aimed at
improving day-to-day contacts, to offset fears of a deterioration in Sino-US
relations, strained over such issues as human rights and arms proliferation.
'We are putting into place one dimension of the overall policy of President
Clinton's programme of broad constructive engagement with China,' Mr Perry
said.
Earlier, the US official had warned in a lecture to People's Liberation Army
officers of the dangers of an arms race in Asia arising from a proliferation
of nuclear weapons. Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the
transfer of nuclear technology. The US has long suspected that Beijing has
been assisting Pakistan develop a nuclear capability. 'We are on the brink
of a nuclear weapons race on the sub-continent, where relations between
India and Pakistan have been tense for years,' Mr Perry said. 'As in Korea,
China has a huge stake in this issue, since it involves nations on its
border. With so much at stake, it is essential that countries with influence
in South Asia try to stop the potential arms race before it gathers
momentum.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Estonia's missing bow door located
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The missing bow section of the ferry Estonia, which sank in the Baltic Sea
last month with the loss of 900 lives, was found yesterday lying in 76m of
water about 2km west of the wrecked ship.
The joint Estonian-Finnish-Swedish investigation team is anxious to inspect
the visor-like outer bow door, which caused the Estonia to capsize and
founder when it was torn off in a storm off the south west coast of Finland
during an overnight voyage from Tallinn to Stockholm.
Evidence from video camera inspections of the wreck has shown that all three
locks designed to hold the 55-tonne bow section in place had broken.
Investigators believe the bow section smashed against the hull and inner
vehicle deck door before it broke away, allowing water to enter the vehicle
deck, causing the ship to sink.
They believe it took only 15 or 20 minutes before the Estonia, jointly
operated by Estonian and Swedish shipping companies, rolled on its side and
began to sink.
The bow section will now be surveyed with video cameras in an effort to find
further evidence of why the locks failed. The inquiry team will also hope to
salvage the bow section so they can investigate whether metal fatigue was to
blame. The Swedish government is considering salvaging the main wreck, but
experts say such a complex and costly operation could not be done until the
spring.
So far there has been no definite evidence of human error causing the bow
doors to fail. Surviving crew members have told investigators the inner bow
door, which should have proved watertight, had been closed. But they said
they could not judge whether the ship had been sailing too fast for the
conditions, as some witnesses have suggested.
The International Maritime Organisation wants a complete review of the
design of roll-on roll-off ferries.

FT  19 OCT 94 / N Korea-US deal eases fears: Breakthrough will end
suspicions of bomb development

International fears over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme
abated yesterday in the wake of a deal that will open the country to
inspections and improve ties with the US.
The agreement is a sign that Mr Kim Jong-il, the new North Korean leader, is
prepared to broaden his country's international contacts.
It also raised hopes that he will accelerate the opening of the country to
foreign investment.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, said the agreement 'goes
a long way' to removing a potential North Korean nuclear threat. A US State
Department spokesman said: 'What we've got is an agreement that made a very
dangerous place in the world at a very dangerous moment a lot safer.'
Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US delegation in the tortuous negotiation,
announced a breakthrough in talks with North Korean officials in Geneva at
midnight on Monday. Chief negotiators made clear that although the agreement
had to be approved by their governments, they were confident it would be
signed on Friday as scheduled.
Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister and head of the
delegation to the Geneva talks, said the planned replacement of North
Korea's existing graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme with
light-water reactor technology would 'completely eliminate and dispel'
suspicions about Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear weapons. The
agreement is linked to the gradual improvement of bilateral relations
between Washington and Pyongyang, which Mr Kang said, would 'make a
significant contribution to greater peace and security in Asia and the rest
of the world'.
The deal apparently provides for a delay in inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency to determine whether North Korea has already
reprocessed plutonium for nuclear weapons.
South Korean officials had expressed concern that such a delay would give
Pyongyang more time to produce a bomb from plutonium it is suspected of
having reprocessed five years ago.
There were also doubts in Seoul about providing North Korea with
international aid that could revive its troubled economy when it appears to
be heading towards collapse.
But officials yesterday acknowledged that they had little choice but to
accept the accord concluded by the US, South Korea's main military and
economic ally.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Dow to buy core of east German chemical sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical of the US intends to take control of the core of the former
East German chemical industry in a deal which will bring DM2.9bn (Dollars
1.87bn) of investment from the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency.
Treuhand officials said that Dow has signed a letter of intent. The company
said the deal would be agreed by the end of the year.
Through its subsidiary Dow Deutschland, Dow intends to buy majority stakes
in the steam cracker at Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the
electrochemical units and derivative operations at Buna, and the
intermediate chemical operations at Leuna.
The three units formed the basis of the old East Germany's chemical industry
before unification. Since then, the Treuhand has been planning to hive off
the entire industry to private investors.
It has been engaged in a big restructuring programme aimed at attracting
investors to install a new steam cracker facility and oil refinery in the
region.
The Treuhand has been providing generous financial investment incentives for
the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical sector, in which 68,500 people had been
employed before 1990. This figure has fallen sharply to 12,300 through
closures, redundancies and early retirement schemes.
The Treuhand will invest DM2.9bn to modernise the polyolefin complex at Buna
and to build a pipeline from the east German northern port of Rostock. This
line will ship gas sold by Gazprom, the Russian state-owned utilities
company, to Buna.
Treuhand officials said that, under the terms of the letter of intent,
majority control of the Buna complex's equity would pass to Dow over a
period of time. The Treuhand would retain a 49 per cent stake for several
years. Dow would eventually acquire 76 per cent of Buna's equity, with
Gazprom taking the rest.
Buna is this year expected to have a turnover of DM800m and losses of about
DM300m. However, Treuhand officials said Buna could move into the black in
four years and the investments would be completed by the end of the decade.
Dow's entry into the east German chemical sector is part of its longer-term
strategy of expanding in Germany and in eastern Europe. 'We are looking at
Europe as a whole. We are looking for opportunities. These exist
particularly in this part of Europe,' a Dow official said. Dow's turnover in
Europe totalled Dollars 4.8bn last year.
Dow already has a plastic foam insulation manufacturing plant in Balaton,
Hungary. After buying into a joint venture with Nitrokemia and Chemolimpex,
two state-owned Hungarian companies in 1991, it acquired a 100 per cent
stake in 1992.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (9): How Iowa
won the battle for a steel mill / Case Study of Ipsco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The course of site location does not always run smoothly. When Ipsco, a
Canadian steel company, was examining places to build a new US plant, one
leading contender was a site in Iowa on the banks of the Mississippi River.
Then came the great Mississippi floods of 1993 and the site disappeared
under 11 feet of water.
Ipsco, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, went on to choose another Iowa site -
again close to the Mississippi, but in a somewhat more elevated position -
as the location for its new Dollars 360m mill, now under construction in the
state's Muscatine County.
The facility, due for completion in April 1996, is one of the biggest
development projects in Iowa. It is designed to produce 1m tonnes of hot
rolled steel annually from scrap metal and will create 300 jobs.
But the project could easily have gone to another mid-western state. Roger
Phillips, president of Ipsco, says that initially Iowa did not figure
prominently in the company's site search - even though Ipsco already had a
steel pipe mill located in the state.
Iowa, says Mr Phillips, was not a leading contender because the state's
taxes on machinery and equipment discouraged investment by capital intensive
industries.
Iowa, however, put itself in the race by suggesting to Ipsco that it might
be able to offer a break on the machinery and equipment tax.
The tax issue apart, the state met a lot of Ipsco's other site requirements:
since steel is heavy, the company needed to be relatively close to the
mid-western markets it wanted to serve. It needed reliable supplies of its
basic raw material, scrap metal, and guarantees of long-term reasonable
electricity prices. Other essentials included good rail and truck transport
links and proximity to a river system.
Its site list finally came down to a choice between three states: Iowa,
Indiana and Kentucky.
Indiana is America's leading steel state, being home both to the large
integrated mills around the town of Gary, and a revolutionary new mini-mill
constructed by Nucor in the agricultural heart of the state. Kentucky has
been particularly aggressive in trying to attract new manufacturing
industry, including steel plants.
From Iowa's point of view, winning the battle for Ipsco became one of the
highest priorities in the state's industrial development strategy.
Iowa is known primarily as an agricultural state and has long been one of
the leading US producers of corn and soya beans. It is also a significant
manufacturer of farm equipment and consumer durable goods, being the home
state of white goods manufacturer Maytag.
However, the state economy suffered badly in the 1980s. Successive
recessions in the farming and durable goods sectors meant it suffered among
the largest percentage drops in its employment base in the nation, losing
8.1 per cent of its workforce and 4.6 per cent of its population.
The 1990s have seen a slow reversal of the population loss as agriculture
has recovered and the state has sought to diversify its economic base.
It has modified its tax structure, put in place financial assistance and job
training programmes, invested Dollars 150m in the construction of an
information superhighway backbone, and started a big marketing push,
including glossy advertisements in leading US business magazines under the
slogan 'the smart state for business'.
The slogan plays on Iowa's traditionally very good educational system and
its strong work ethic. (Mr Phillips says that the reputation of the school
system was not a deciding factor for his company, 'but it was icing on the
cake').
Among the sectors targeted by the state for development efforts are
insurance and financial services (Des Moines has become a significant
insurance centre); agricultural products processing; and the metals
industry, which is concentrated in the eastern part of the states.
Its emphasis on metals led state development authorities to go aggressively
after the Ipsco project.
The most important component of the Dollars 75m package the state put
together is the elimination of the property tax on machinery and equipment
for the project, which required special approval of the state legislature.
The Iowa senate initially rejected the incentive package, last February, but
then passed the measure when Ipsco threatened to walk away.
The package includes just Dollars 3m of upfront state financial assistance,
about half that which will go on road construction. The vast bulk of the aid
is in various forms of tax credits, which are dependent on Ipsco making a
very substantial investment in the state. Some Dollars 36m consists of
exemption from the machinery and equipment tax, while Dollars 8.5m comprises
foregone state corporate tax.
However, Iowa economists reckon that state and local tax receipts could
receive a Dollars 120m boost over 20 years, thanks to the project's impact
on population and earnings growth, and that the public benefits of aid for
the mill will easily outstrip the costs.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (10): Where
small-town values predominate - Martin Dickson examines why the Rocky
Mountain states have become so popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why are the Rocky Mountain states the fastest growing region of the US? What
are the factors encouraging businesses to relocate to the area?
The six states down the spine of the Rocky Mountains - Montana, Idaho, Utah,
Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico - together with neighbouring Arizona and
Nevada, are expected to show growth of around 5.3 per cent this year and 4
per cent in 1995.
The expansion is all the more impressive in that it is not due to booming
oil or metal prices. The Rockies have traditionally been dependent on
mining, oil, farming and forestry, and the region has a history of booms and
busts tied to commodity cycles.
Denver, Colorado, the Rockies' main city, enjoyed strong growth in the late
1970s, thanks to the global oil crisis, but the region largely missed out on
the strong economic growth which characterised most other regions of the US
during the 1980s.
The current expansion is relatively broad-based, and includes a significant
number of high technology companies. But while impressive, it needs to be
put in perspective: the Rocky Mountains are one of the least significant
economic regions of the US, and the base from which the area is growing is
small relative to other parts of the nation. The gross regional product of
the Rocky states was only Dollars 337bn in 1993, compared to well over
Dollars 1,000bn for the booming South Atlantic region, which has Atlanta as
its main business centre.
The region's high overall growth rate also hides considerable differences in
the various parts of what is an extraordinarily diverse area, ranging from
the rolling wheat fields of eastern Montana to the deserts of the
south-west.
So while cities such as Las Vegas, Nevada, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Boise,
Idaho, are all booming, predominantly rural Wyoming, with no large cities
and poor air transport services, is enjoying only modest growth.
All that said, rapid growth in the Rockies is significant, in that it points
up business location factors which may become increasingly important.
Three reasons for the influx of companies and individual entrepreneurs stand
out: the relatively low cost of doing business in the area; its pro-business
climate; and its open spaces and stunning scenery.
So far, the Rocky Mountain states have not used lavish tax incentives to
attract business - because they have not needed, or been able to afford to
do so. There are, inevitably, exceptions: last year Rio Rancho, New Mexico,
gave a Dollars 114m tax incentive package to encourage Intel, the
California-based semi-conductor manufacturer, into expanding its plant.
What the Rocky states do use to lure business are propaganda campaigns,
aimed in large measure at Californian companies, which highlight the fact
that the cost of doing business there is relatively cheap.
Many of the campaigns are aimed at small companies - the kind creating most
of the job growth in the US.
Labour costs are well below the national average, and so are many other
business expenses. Idaho, for example, reckons that a Californian company
moving to the state can not only halve its pay bill, but it can cut fringe
benefits around 50 per cent, the cost of workers' compensation for injury by
a similar amount, and utility costs by more than 60 per cent. Companies
which have set up substantial operations in Boise include technology groups
Hewlett-Packard and Micron Technology.
Land prices are also far cheaper in the Rockies than in California, though
the recent boom has begun to put significant upward pressure on house
prices.
The states have also adopted aggressively pro-business policies, for example
by imposing moderate business taxes and cutting the red tape required to set
up shop. One company which relocated last year to Rio Rancho, New Mexico,
obtained a building permit in less than two weeks at a cost of just Dollars
2,200. It reckoned that the same exercise in southern California might have
taken 18 months and cost Dollars 40,000.
Another factor working in the Rockies' favour is the work ethic, which
remains high in this area, as in many parts of the US which have
traditionally relied on farming.
'Labour is cheaper and the work ethic is higher, so you get more bang for
your buck,' says an official at a company which moved from California to
Boise three years ago.
The state of Utah has benefited particularly strongly from this perception.
Some 70 per cent of its population belongs to the Mormon church, based in
Salt Lake City. Mormons are known for their strong family values and
emphasis on hard work and education.
Some companies also hope that the high quality of life in the Rockies will
enable them to attract and keep well-educated employees. The mountains offer
a wealth of outdoor leisure activities, ranging from skiing in the winter to
trout fishing and horseback riding in the summer. The crime rate is
generally low and traffic congestion minimal. Small-town values predominate.
Says Ms DeeDee Corradini, mayor of Salt Lake City: 'A decade ago, when I
talked to businesses about moving to an area like this, they wanted to know
what it meant for them financially. Today, I'm finding more and more asking:
'What's the quality of life? Will our employees and their families be happy
living there?''
However, California is fighting back against the lure of the Rockies - for
example, by promising to cut its red tape - and the Rockies also have some
significant drawbacks for companies looking for the right business location.
The smaller cities and towns in the region have unimpressive air transport
links with the rest of America. Continental Airlines, for example, one of a
small number of airlines serving Montana, has withdrawn completely from the
state this year.
Small-town virtues can also mean small-town dullness, and some companies
could find it hard to get sophisticated employees to relocate to the region
from America's principal cities.
As for foreign companies, Asian ones are likely to prefer a West coast
location (though Utah has attracted some Japanese investment) and European
ones may be put off by the significantly greater distance from headquarters
 -both in distance and time zone - than the Atlantic seaboard.
The present boom is also bringing new social problems to the region: many
long-time Rocky Mountain residents resent the newcomers, and there have been
confrontations in some Utah towns between straight-laced Mormons and racier
Californian newcomers.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (11): Tomorrow's
locations - New trends shaping site selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In considering a business location, it is important to weigh up the fact
that communities are constantly changing, and so are the needs of industry.
What looks like an excellent site today may seem a bad choice 10 years down
the road, and vice versa.
So what do locational experts see as important new trends shaping company
site selection over the next decade or so? One of the most important is that
North American businesses will become increasingly reliant on well-educated
employees - so-called knowledge workers - such as computer technicians,
accountants, and engineers, who can give their companies the critical value
added they need to compete against increasingly fierce global competition.
Factory floor employees will also need to be better trained to perform their
jobs well - for example, in keeping track of the computers which run the
production process.
Companies which prosper are therefore likely to be attracted to areas which
can lure knowledge workers to live in them; which have good secondary and
higher education systems; and which are willing to offer generous aid in
training workers.
Somewhat paradoxically, these criteria throw up as favourable centres an
extremely broad range of communities - from some old eastern cities to
relatively new urban clusters in the desert south-west and rural
communities.
For knowledge workers are attracted both to large urban centres of
intellectual excellence and to the quality of life available in more rural
surroundings, away from the crime, pollution and congestion of the
metropolis.
Some of the most favoured business locations in North America manage to
combine intellectual excellence with a high quality of life.
Perhaps the most outstanding example is the Raleigh/Durham area of North
Carolina, which has at its heart the 7,000-acre Research Triangle Park, a
vast campus for high-technology whose resident companies include Du Pont,
Glaxo and Ciba-Geigy.
It is broadly in the middle of a triangle between the region's three big
universities - Duke, University of North Carolina and Carolina State. The
area is leafy, the climate mild, the cost of living relatively low, and
skiing mountains and the Atlantic ocean only a few hours' drive away.
Some analysts see so-called 'second tier' cities, somewhat akin to the
Raleigh/Durham model, becoming increasingly attractive as locations. These
are smaller centres, with lower business costs, which have modernised
themselves over the past decade or more and offer up-to-date facilities, but
a relaxed quality of life. To fare best, however, they need good transport
links and a good university or two.
Examples (all with populations of under 1m) include Albany, the still rather
sleepy capital of New York state; Birmingham, Alabama, a city which has
transformed itself from a dusty steel town into a centre of medical
excellence; Austin, the capital of Texas, which has become a significant
computer industry centre and is home to the main campus of the University of
Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah, emerging as a significant high-technology
centre; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which has become a substantial back
office and distribution centre and has an excellent vocational education
system.
However, some of America's largest cities are also expected to remain
extremely attractive business locations - despite their relatively high
costs - because of the sheer concentration of knowledge workers found there.
New York ,for example, will remain a crucial centre for finance, the media,
the professions and international trade.
Other big cities which appear to have a particularly bright future include
Boston, thanks to computers, medicine, finance and its universities;
Chicago, with an extremely diverse industrial base and excellent
universities; San Francisco/San Jose, with Silicon Valley retaining its
pre-eminent position as an information technology centre; and Houston, which
has diversified from oil and gas into a broad range of high-technology and
engineering industries and is home to several excellent universities.
Atlanta, Georgia, the capital of the booming south-east, is also extremely
well placed, as is Seattle, with its cluster of high-technology industries,
beautiful setting and close links with Asia.
Companies, however, should not rule out of their calculations rust-belt
cities which have suffered in the past from a poor image. Take, for example,
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which in the 1980s was a byword for industrial
depression as its surrounding steel mills closed. It has diversified its
economic base and the city centre, with its dramatic riverside setting, now
has a thriving, confident air.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (8): Southern
comfort for BMW - Barbara Harrison discusses a car company's move to South
Carolina
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alongside interstate highway 85 in South Carolina stands a large billboard
with the BMW logo on it and this statement: 'Soon the world will know South
Carolina craftsmanship.'
The billboard seems a proud and defiant answer to all those who harbour
doubts about why BMW chose to locate its first US car plant in the American
Deep South.
Many non-southern Americans still regard the South as an unsophisticated
backwater, whose people are under-educated and unskilled. Referring
pejoratively to all southerners as 'Bubba', the sceptics snidely asked: 'Can
Bubba build BMWs?'
The question held a special edge, since no European car company, much less
one that built luxury cars, has ever succeeded in manufacturing in the US.
Yet, BMW is the 46th German company to invest in South Carolina's
Spartanburg County, in the Piedmont of the Appalachian mountains. It is the
76th German firm to invest in South Carolina.
'The capability of South Carolinians is well known in Germany,' says BMW
spokesman Bobby Hitt.
But Mr Hitt, himself a native South Carolinian, acknowledges that the
state's stake in the plant's success is high.
South Carolinians 'have the success of the plant in their hearts and minds
because they know it's a statement about our people', he said.
This is so despite many other foreign investors in South Carolina, which
ranks 13 out of the 50 American states in total foreign investment.
But the BMW plant has the highest profile of the lot, which includes Robert
Bosch, Michelin and other European high-end machining and high-technology
manufacturing firms.
BMW's primary reasons for choosing South Carolina were straightforward.
Labour and overall operating costs were relatively cheap, suppliers were at
the ready (including the 28 US companies that already served the company's
German plants), the labour force was available and of good quality, the US
is the company's second largest market and the state's Dollars 130m
incentive programme was attractive.
BMW is pleased with its move so far. The Dollars 400m plant, on which
construction began in April 1993, opened its doors on schedule for the first
workers in July. The 1.2m sq ft building rises in windowless pristine white
from a 1,039-acre site, which still bears construction equipment and dirt
mounds.
Construction work continues on the 17,000 sq ft Zentrum, or visitors'
centre, which is the architectural centrepiece of the plant. In keeping with
BMW's high profile, the Zentrum will be used for a display of BMW's history
and as a staging point for tours of the plant.
The plant, which will be officially inaugurated next month, has all
manufacturing operations under one roof and among its innovations is an
assembly line that crosses itself, like an upside down small 'e'.
The reasoning behind the design is almost purely to pump up the morale of
the workforce. After a car completes the U-shaped production portion of the
line, it is turned and rolled down through the middle for final testing.
This allows those who work at the start of the line to see the finished
product - and, of course, be on hand for any last-minute touching up.
The plant's initial 520 workers, including fewer than 30 Germans, produced
their first car on September 8. Although the plant was designed to make any
model BMW, the first car was a 318i.
The plant will make the 318 and the 325 models over the next year, and then
start in August 1995 with the yet-to-be-unveiled roadster. Production is
expected to rise to 290 units a day in 1996 with a workforce of 1,200. By
the end of the decade, the plant is expected to employ 2,000.
While it is too soon to render a judgment on whether Bubba can make BMWs,
the company is satisfied with its workers so far. It has, however, been
extremely selective. When the job application deadline was reached last
November, nearly 60,000 people had applied.
The starting hourly wage is Dollars 12 and it rises to Dollars 16.20. This
is modest by US auto industry standards, but enviable by any South Carolina
measure.
The firm is giving preference to those who live in the area, but it is also
seeking bright and ambitious people who see themselves making a career at
BMW.
The worker who drove the first car off the line, for example, is a former
school teacher. One of the attractions of South Carolina is its excellent
technical training colleges.
But BMW is no doubt cautious about pro-union people. While the company says
it is not anti-union, South Carolina is a right-to-work state and BMW at
least harbours a hope that its plant will stay out of the grasp of the
United Auto Workers' Union.
It is concentrating on creating a culture of worker empowerment. People are
trained to work in teams and be independent decision-makers.
To cut down on the attitude of 'us and them', there is no executive dining
room, all employees including the president wear a simple white work jacket
bearing the BMW logo, and there are no walls separating the plant's top
brass from the floor workers.
Whether inculcating the concept of worker empowerment will insulate that
plant from unionism remains unclear. But were the plant to be organised by
the UAW, it would be an aberration in South Carolina.
Meanwhile, BMW's investment has brought a string of its suppliers. Twelve
suppliers have already relocated into the area, bringing investment of more
than Dollars 114m and more than 1,000 additional jobs. Another dozen
suppliers of the estimated final 70 for the plant are expected to relocate
in the state.
The added investment by suppliers not only makes operating easier and
cheaper for the company but provides yet more reasons (mostly in the shape
of jobs) for BMW's success to be in the hearts and minds of South
Carolinians.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (7): Decided
advantages and drawbacks / A look at the issues influencing the choice of
location
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deciding where to locate a business in North America presents a company with
an extremely complex trade-off between factors ranging from real estate and
labour costs to market proximity and the local quality of life.
Much will depend on the type of business in which a company is engaged, and
the markets it is serving.
A steel mini-mill, for example, needs to be reasonably close to its markets,
given the sheer bulk of its product, and also needs a secure supply of cheap
electricity and scrap metal. Entertainment companies will be drawn to the
industry's greatest concentrations of talent - in Los Angeles and New York
City.
Tele-marketing companies can be located anywhere in the region, thanks to
reliable communications systems, though they will tend towards areas where
labour is cheap and the inhabitants do not have pronounced regional accents.
Industry specific issues apart, the most important factors in site location
include the following:
Real estate costs - including lease rates, construction costs and upfront
rent concessions - constitute one of the most important relocation
decisions, and as the chart shows, there are huge disparities between North
American cities, with southern sunbelt and mid-western US states
substantially cheaper than the east and west coasts.
The North American market as a whole is only slowly recovering from the
severe property slump of 1990-1993 as the US economy expands. The US
national average vacancy rate in the office sector remains not far below 20
per cent, with occupancy in primary buildings improving at the expense of
secondary space. The industrial market, subject to less speculative activity
in the 1980s, has less of an overhang, with the south-east, south-west and
mid-west showing strongest demand.
Labour costs, quality and availability. Wages rates vary widely across North
America, (see table), with the eastern seaboard, California and some
mid-western states showing significantly higher labour costs than the
southern sunbelt and mountain states.
Mexico, in turn, hugely uncuts both the US and Canada. However, a recent
survey of corporate real estate managers by location consultants Ernst &amp;
Young* found that labour costs were only of middling concern in site
selection decisions, ranked well behind the availability of an educated
workforce. This would appear to favour states and cities which can combine
reasonable wage costs and a reputation for good education. A prime example
is Utah, which has been enjoying one of the fastest rates of economic growth
in the US over the past two years.
Infrastructure. Access to principal highways is of crucial importance to
most companies and some 46 per cent of participants in the Ernst &amp; Young
study reckoned that the availability of advanced energy and
telecommunications systems was a very important location criterion. Access
to a principal airport with convenient flights will also be important to
many companies, particularly foreign businesses with executives constantly
shuttling across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Tax and regulatory environment. A favourable local government attitude
towards business and low property tax rates tend to be high on companies'
site selection factors.
However, the Ernst &amp; Young study found tax and start-up incentives - so
often highlighted in media reports of relocation decisions - were only named
by 27 per cent of participants as constituting a very important location
factor.
This is perhaps not surprising, since such concessions tend to be considered
fairly late in the selection process, as a tie-breaker between sites on a
company's short list. But they can still be an important factor in location
decisions - particularly in the case of the largest, prestige plants which
states are desperate to attract.
A very substantial factor in Mercedes' decision to locate its new plant in
Alabama was the hefty package of incentives offered by the state. They
totalled Dollars 253m and included Dollars 17.4m to buy the plant site for
Mercedes and develop it, Dollars 42.6m for building construction and Dollars
30m for a training centre. Alabama is also paying Dollars 60m for training
Mercedes workers and Dollars 77m for developing the related infrastructure,
such as roads and water lines.
On top of all that, Mercedes qualifies for tax breaks, related to its
profits and head count, which could total Dollars 9.2m a year for up to 25
years.
Quality of Life. This broad category of factors ranges from cost of living
to the local crime rate, quality of schools, climate, physical beauty of
surroundings and access to recreational facilities.
Cost of living, which again varies considerably from region to region (see
chart), can be a significant factor in location decisions. A company
situated in an area of particularly high living costs, such as the greater
New York area, can find it hard to get qualified personnel to relocate to
the area without paying higher wages than it need do elsewhere.
However, the Ernst &amp; Young survey found that other quality of life
characteristics - such as climate and cultural facilities - ranked fairly
low with location professionals.
That said, quality of life issues can carry considerably more weight in two
circumstances. One is when professional individuals are relocating. Thanks
to modern telecommunications systems, they can work from a wide variety of
rural and semi-rural locations and a significant number of these so-called
'lone eagles' are setting up in business in the Rocky Mountains, attracted
by its scenic beauty.
The second situation is when a company moves to a new location in large
measure because the chief executive happens to like it.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (6): A grudging
declaration of victory - Industry and the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer, Luxembourg's Industry Federation, Fedil, somewhat grudgingly
declared victory in the battle against recession. Order books were filling
and margins improving, the federation conceded, although it cautioned that
the recovery would not be fully evident until 1995.
Why the reluctance? For Fedil, the downturn has been a useful stick with
which to beat the government for what the industrialists see as its failure
to tackle the structural problems of the Luxembourg economy, which they view
as a threat to the country's long-term competitiveness.
To drive home the point, the federation sent an elegantly-produced
'memorandum' to the 60 MPs elected in the June 12 general election, entitled
The Economic, Social and Environmental Policy Stakes.
The document called for a series of measures to assist economic development
in general and industry in particular, including a reduction in the overall
level of corporate taxation, greater state assistance in cash and kind for
the creation of new enterprises, the abolition - or at least modification -
of the automatic system of salary indexation, and greater flexibility in
employment regulations.
At the top of the hit-list of Fedil and other employers' groups is the
cost-of-living indexation of salaries, which they say fuels inflation and
keeps Luxembourg producers at a disadvantage vis a vis competitors abroad.
'We must stimulate the spirit of enterprise and entrepreneurship,' says Mr
Marc Assa, the federation's president. 'The enterprise is the basis of a
nation's prosperity and well-being, and we must not allow this reality out
of our sight.'
For years, Fedil has been arguing that unless the authorities take action,
Luxembourg risks the displacement of its industrial activity to countries
with lower costs. But the trend in industrial investment seems, if anything,
to belie that.
Certainly, Sommer Allibert, the French industrial group of which Mr Assa is
chief executive, does not seem worried about Luxembourg's future
competitiveness. In September, the group inaugurated two new factories at
Eselborn in northern Luxembourg to manufacture vehicle components and floor
coverIngs, an investment totalling nearly two billion francs.
Mr Assa used the occasion to announce that Sommer had decided to invest a
further billion francs in the Grand Duchy for the development and
introduction of new products geared to meeting tougher European
environmental standards, as well as the creation of a research and
development centre.
This decision, he noted, was due in part to the advantageous economic
environment.
Although no new large-scale, multi-billion-franc projects have been
announced in Luxembourg recently, several have come on line, such as
Guardian's automotive glass products facility near Grevenmacher in the east,
or are being implemented, such as a toy factory for the US Rubbermaid group
in Differdange and a wood products plant for Austrian company Kronospan in
Sanem.
The jobs created by the American and Austrian investments, in an area of
southern Luxembourg which 20 years ago was almost entirely dependent on the
steel industry, illustrates the success of the policy of industrial
diversification pursued by successive Luxembourg governments.
The policy, backed up by extensive construction of infrastructure and a
package of tax incentives, has been aimed at small projects as well as
large, and made the Grand Duchy an exporter of composite materials for
Formula 1 cars and of Japanese mushrooms as well as of glass, aluminium foil
and videotapes.
Meanwhile, Luxembourg's steel producer, Arbed, is resurfacing after a big
downturn which brought group losses of LFr5.7bn last year. The group now
says it hopes to be back in the black for 1994.
In the early 1970s, Arbed employed more than 27,000 people in the Grand
Duchy. By the end of 1996 this figure will be nearer 6,000. But the company
is in the middle of a LFr18bn modernisation programme which involves the
installation of electric arc furnaces and continuous casting facilities at
three Luxembourg sites and one in Thuringia, Germany.
The group's confidence was emphasised earlier this year by its decision to
acquire a controlling interest in the struggling Bremen-based Klockner Stahl
through its Belgian subsidiary, Sidmar of Ghent. The deal makes Arbed
Europe's third-largest steelmaker after France's Usinor-Sacilor and British
Steel.
Arbed's steady shedding of manpower has been achieved without any
significant increase in unemployment. The jobless total peaked in January at
some 4,800 and now seems to have stabilised at about 4,000, some 2.4 per
cent of the workforce. That figure is double the average unemployment figure
as recently as 1990, but it must be set against an increase in total
employment between 1990 and 1993 of some 19,000 jobs.
Of the total 187,000 employees in March 1993, more than 47,000 were
cross-border commuters from Belgium, France and Germany. Together with
resident non-Luxembourgers, foreigners have accounted for a majority of jobs
since 1992 and last year they occupied nearly 53 per cent of jobs.
The steady increase in employment (or at least of foreigners - the number of
Luxembourgers has been falling in absolute terms since 1991) has slowed in
the past couple of years, reflecting an economic downturn which bottomed out
at 0.3 per cent growth last year.
Only in the first quarter of 1993 did the economy actually contract - by 0.3
per cent.
The official forecasts of growth of 1.5 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent
next are already being overtaken. Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, finance minister,
presenting his draft 1995 budget to parliament in September, said he was
calculating on growth of 2.9 per cent.
The downturn has left its scars, however. The number of bankruptcies has
risen from 100 in 1991 to 233 last year and 125 in the first four months of
this year.
But there is at least one sector where recovery is already being celebrated.
Commercial property, which was the first to hit the doldrums, now seems well
set to grow, According to property brokers Jones Lang Wootton, the amount of
empty office space fell by about 35 per cent last year as demand picked up.
Office blocks which stood empty for months are filling up as firms,
particularly in the financial sector, take the plunge into new premises. New
developments are under way in the Luxembourg City suburbs of Kirchberg and
Gasperich, and a business park near the city's airport is now full,
practically to the last square metre.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (7): New era of
opportunities - The insurance sector is expecting growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year was an excellent one throughout Luxembourg's insurance and
reinsurance sector, the Grand Duchy's Insurance Commission was able to
report in October in its annual survey of the market.
The completion of the single market in insurance - with the implementation
of the European Union's third generation life and non-life directives, which
took effect on July 1 - now offers Luxembourg the opportunity to become a
centre for the cross-border life insurance industry, the authorities believe
and hope.
'The life business has developed tremendously well over the past couple of
years,' says Mr Victor Rod, the Insurance Commissioner, who is admired by
players in the cross-border market for his vision in creating a hospitable
legislative, regulatory and fiscal environment for the sector. A decade ago
he took similar steps to create a captive reinsurance industry in
Luxembourg.
Many industry players believe Mr Rod is onto another winner. At the last
count, about 20 'dedicated' cross-border life insurers were selling products
on a pan-European basis, along with seven domestic insurers also active on a
cross-border basis.
By contrast, the Dublin International Financial Services Centre, widely
perceived to be Luxembourg's main rival for pan-European business, had four
companies, although both centres have more applications in the pipeline.
Even under the EU's Second Life (Services) Directive, a half-way house on
the way to the single market which allowed companies to sell products
cross-border to customers who asked for them, freedom of services (ie
non-domestic) business made up 71 per cent of all life premiums received by
the industry in 1993.
The new era will also mean changes in the local Luxembourg market, which is
dominated by two large domestic insurers and the subsidiaries or branches of
Belgian, French, German and Swiss companies. Instead of the Commission
setting prices and conditions for the industry, companies will be free to
decide their own - perhaps to the benefit of the long-suffering Luxembourg
consumer.
In fact, Luxembourg is one of the EU countries which have not yet passed the
so-called third generation insurance directives into national legislation,
in large part because of disruption caused by a general election in June and
the subsequent formation of a government, followed by the country's
traditional summer hiatus. The legislation is scheduled to go through
parliament in November.
According to Mr Rod, Luxembourg offers an 'unbeatable combination' of
advantages as a life insurance centre - the existence of the banks and
investment funds, fund management skills, a central location, the linguistic
abilities of Luxembourgers and other residents, strict confidentiality rules
which match those applying to banks, and the lack of any premium or capital
tax. All those advantages are available elsewhere, he says, but not in one
single place.
All areas of the Luxembourg market - life and non-life, domestic and
international, direct insurance and reinsurance - enjoyed growth in 1993,
according to the Commission. At year-end the sector comprised 73 companies,
but four new life companies have opened since then.
Non-life premiums rose 18.12 per cent to LFr24.4bn, while life business grew
40.4 per cent, to LFr20.4bn, of which LFr14.6bn consisted of cross-border
business. This growth compares with an increase of 146.3 per cent in life
premium income in 1992, the first year in which pan-European business
represented a substantial proportion of the total.
Two companies dominated cross-border business last year and will continue to
do so in 1994. PanEuroLife, established by France's UAP group and the Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg, had premium income of some LFr6.3bn in 1993 and
expects to exceed LFr10bn this year.
Lombard International Assurance, whose shareholders include Standard Life,
Europe's largest mutual life assurance company, and Aberdeen Trust from
Britain and Switzerland's InterAllianz Bank, notched up Pounds 81m
(LFr4.25bn) last year, and Mr Andrew McKinna, marketing director, says the
company is on course to meet its 1994 target of Pounds 150m.
Lombard's target is the so-called 'grey panther' - the growing market of
medium-rich Europeans which is also the focus of Luxembourg's private
banking sector. 'Life insurance enjoys an advantage over banks and
investment funds,' says Mr McKinna, 'because it offers open tax benefits in
our target markets' - Germany, Britain, the Benelux countries, Sweden and
increasingly France.
Mr McKinna says Lombard would be happy to see more competition because it
would demonstrate the maturity of the sector - and would help to attract new
customers to all market players. It looks as though he won't have too long
to wait.
A new wave of companies is now making plans to enter the market, with
British institutions to the fore. Scottish Equitable and CMI have publicly
declared their intention to come to Luxembourg; Norwich Union and Scottish
Provident International have made no secret of their interest.
There's more to come, according to Mr James Ball, whose consultancy firm,
JBI Associates, specialises in the insurance sector. 'Since July 1 there has
been great interest from the United Kingdom which was not there before,' he
says. 'There's hardly a company there which is not in the marketplace. But
German companies are showing interest too.'
So are local ones. Le Foyer, Luxembourg's largest domestic insurers, has
already ventured into the cross-border market by selling products to Danish
expatriates. A change in the law curtailed that business, but Francois
Tesch, managing director, says the company is seeking foreign partners and
is devoting a third of its resources to foreign projects.
Somewhat overshadowed these days by the more glamorous life business,
Luxembourg continues to expand its role as a centre for captive reinsurance
business, first welcomed in 1984 at the urging of Swedish companies which
were forbidden by their national authorities to establish captives in
offshore jurisdictions such as Bermuda.
The reinsurance sector numbered 201 at the end of August thanks to a sudden
burst of expansion, with 19 new licences being delivered since the beginning
of this year. According to the Commission, some 20 more applications are
likely to be approved in the coming months.
The reinsurance sector, which until recently was dominated by Scandinavian,
French and Belgian companies, collected premiums totalling LFr65.2bn in 1993
and at year-end had accumulated technical provisions totalling LFr153bn (up
42 per cent in two years) under rules which allow reserves of up to 20 times
premium income to be sheltered from corporate taxation.
Mr Rod believes that prospects for growth in the reinsurance sector are
limited now because most of the multinational groups which meet Luxembourg's
stringent criteria for the establishment of captives are already represented
here. But a wave of interest from German groups, with five new companies set
to be established this year, may persuade him to revise his view.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (4): Business
looks southwards - Canada / The pros and cons of a move north of the 49th
parallel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The climate for investment in Canada has improved markedly in recent years.
The irony is that many businesses, once established north of the 49th
parallel, prefer to look southward to the US for new opportunities.
Much of the impetus has come from the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact and
this year's North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which also includes
Mexico.
Free trade has broadened Canadian-based companies' horizons. At the same
time, the twin shocks of free trade and the 1990-92 recession have brought
about a sharp improvement in productivity. Trade unions and government
regulators have become more flexible as domestic industry has been exposed
to stiffer foreign competition.
The economic upswing is now well under way, with real growth expected to
reach around 4 per cent this year, one of the highest among OECD countries.
This year's climb in interest rates could dampen growth slightly in 1995,
but economists forecast that output will expand by at least another 3 per
cent.
Despite the growth in overall business activity, property prices and office
rentals in most cities have yet to recover fully from the recession.
Inflation is virtually non-existent, although it is likely to accelerate to
about 3 per cent next year.
The federal government and the 10 provinces - even the three governed by the
interventionist New Democratic Party - eagerly court foreign investors.
Regulators are making life easier for business by gradually lightening their
touch on such industries as telecommunications, power generation, transport
and energy. Growing competition among telephone companies has cut the cost
of long-distance calls by as much as 60 per cent over the past seven years.
The climate in Ontario, which generates some two-fifths of Canada's total
economic activity, could brighten further after provincial elections due to
be held next year. Barring a dramatic reversal in its low popularity
ratings, Ontario's present NDP government is likely to be replaced by a more
business-friendly Liberal or Conservative administration.
Owen Krassweller, international tax director in Ernst &amp; Young's Toronto
office, adds that many overseas companies looking for a North American base
feel more comfortable with the lifestyle and business culture in Canada than
in the US. 'Rightly or wrongly, Canadians are perceived as being more open,
honest and easier to deal with than Americans,' he says.
Mr Krassweller says the conventional wisdom that corporate taxes are lower
in the US than Canada is 'probably a misconception'. He estimates that
combined federal and state taxes in New York state are 'not much different'
north of the border. Furthermore, US employers bear the full brunt of the
cost of health care for their employees, while the Canadian provinces fund
their services from general tax revenues (including in several cases, a
payroll health tax).
Even the threat of Quebec breaking away from the rest of the country is not
necessarily a deterrent to setting up in Canada. 'Regardless of the
political outcome, the people will still be there, and there will still be
economic activity,' says Peter Jones, president of the Canadian subsidiary
of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, which is in the process of
expanding its Toronto-based operations.
Salomon is by no means alone. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
brightening business climate has drawn a substantial number of foreign
companies to Canada - either to set up new businesses or to expand existing
ones.
However, with the notable exception of North American and Japanese
carmakers, most of the investments have been in service sectors.
The list of US retailers that have moved into Canada is long. Wal-Mart paid
about CDollars 300m earlier this year for 122 stores owned by FW Woolworth.
Home Depot, a big Atlanta hardware chain, has set up a joint venture with a
subsidiary of Molson, the diversified Canadian brewer.
Looser regulation of the telecommunications industry has attracted several
foreign telephone companies, notably US-based Sprint, MCI and AT&amp;T. The
latter owns 20 per cent of Unitel, which pioneered competition in the
long-distance market against the consortium of provincial monopolies.
On the other side of the balance sheet, Canada also has some definite
liabilities - and not only frigid winters.
Personal taxes are substantially higher in Canada than in the US. The top
marginal tax rate is around 51-53 per cent in most provinces, except Alberta
where it is 46 per cent.
House prices in Toronto and Vancouver are higher than in most US cities.
Mortgage payments are not tax-deductible and many household goods - ranging
from petrol to cigarettes - are considerably more expensive in Canada.
Mr Jones says that these differences favour hiring people locally or buying
a Canadian business: 'It's expensive to transfer someone from a US location
to a Canadian location.' He estimates that a US executive's salary must be
roughly doubled to maintain the same after-tax income in Canada.
Geography and demographics are a daunting obstacle to any business planning
to operate in more than one region. With a total of only 29m inhabitants,
Canada - which is sometimes described as a 'clothes line of a country' -
stretches across five-and-a-half time zones. The four Atlantic provinces are
separated from the rest of the country by French-speaking Quebec.
The provinces' wide powers, which in some cases overlap with the federal
government, can make life difficult for business. Different rules and
standards, including different tax regimes, apply in each province.
Some progress has recently been made in bringing down non-tariff trade
barriers between the provinces, such as procurement preferences and
professional licensing requirements. But they remain an irritant.
Provincial government policies can vary widely. At one extreme, Alberta's
Conservative administration is closing hospitals and schools in pursuit of
its target of a balanced budget by 1997. At the other, Ontario has expanded
the rights of trade unions and tightened 'employment equity' rules for the
hiring of minority groups.
Quebec's agenda is likely to be dominated by the new government's drive to
win the independence referendum which it has promised to hold in 1995.
With all these regional wrinkles, it's hardly surprising that many
businesses, both domestic and foreign, prefer to expand into the US rather
than tackle other parts of Canada. Free trade has made that strategy even
more attractive.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (6): Choosing
the ideal site
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first step in site selection is corporate planning. Consultants
emphatically say that a company's strategy for a relocation must be clear
from the start. In this, consultants can elicit some clarity by posing the
right questions, such as 'What are the problems you think a move would
solve?'
The consultants then begin to explore the needs that a company must have
satisfied in any relocation. These can vary. If it is a distribution centre,
highways, airports, telecommunications and proximity of markets will be at
the top the list.
If it is a manufacturing plant, the availability of labour, wages, power
costs, proximity of suppliers and operational costs will be top concerns.
A variety of data bases are consulted to find a pool of locations that fit
the client's needs. These are then whittled down after closer examination
and a refinement of demands. For example, a good consultant will know that
an American high school diploma in New York city means little in the way of
basic skills, while the same diploma in Minneapolis means the graduate can
read, write and do sums.
With a narrowed list, the consultants then often organise field trips for
the company's top executives to see the sites themselves. These often
include presentations by local business and government officials. Some
cities and states have sophisticated business recruitment programs and
consultants should have the knowledge to know who can really deliver on
their promises.
Consultants can help sort out the incentives and deal sweeteners that
various locations offer. And, once the choice is made, they will negotiate
the deal and implement it. This can mean everything from helping relocated
employees find housing to advice on job-hunting for spouses and schools.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (5): Unseen
players for big stakes - Barbara Harrison examines the role of relocation
advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Site selection consultants are often the unseen players in the big stakes
game of relocation. So, who are they?
A few decades or so ago, site selection was a relatively narrow affair that
included assessing real estate prices and the pros and cons of various
locations in terms of roads, electricity, local wage rates, airport access,
and other critical factors. These assessments were often handled inside a
company.
But outside consultants were increasingly brought in as the selection
process became more competitive among US cities and states offering
incentives to attract investors. Advisers, as outsiders, were considered
more objective about the alternatives.
Today, site consulting has mushroomed into a significant business. Although
no public estimates exist on total fees earned or even the total amount of
investment handled, site consultants say the business is lucrative and point
to the entry of the big six accountancy firms as evidence of fat fees.
The two leading traditional firms specialising in site consultancy are
Chicago-based PHH Fantus and New York-based Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer (MS&amp;B). The
big six accountancy firms have more recently joined the fray, in particular
Deloitte &amp; Touche, Andersen Consulting, Price Waterhouse, and Ernst &amp; Young.
Several large engineering firms, notably California-based Fluor Daniel which
handled Mercedes' move to Alabama, also offer site consulting services. And
there is a plethora of small shops, specialising in particular areas.
The levels of business among firms varies widely. The annual number of
assignments for an industry leader such as Fantus, which handled BMW's move
to South Carolina, is more than 100, almost all of which come from blue-chip
companies, while a small shop might handle two or three deals a year.
But Fantus and Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer have been fighting some increasing hot
competition in the past few years, especially from the big six. Ernst &amp;
Young only formally constituted its site selection unit two years ago and it
is already handling 20 to 30 assignments a year, according to Barry
Barovick, director of corporate real estate consulting for Ernst &amp; Young.
Deloitte &amp; Touche decided it could build a separate practice around site
selection about three years ago. With two top consultants poached from
Fantus, Mark Klender and Philip Schneider, it has one of the stronger fully
dedicated site selection teams at the big six.
The strength of the big six entering this segment of consulting work is that
they have a substantial client base as well as a depth of expertise in such
areas as tax, management consulting and real estate that other relocation
firms may not have.
Similarly, engineering firms such as Fluor Daniel have wide experience in
the actual implementation - the engineering and construction - of plant
relocations, particularly for manufacturing. Fluor has been providing advice
on siting since 1974. William Dorsey, director of Fluor's Siting and
Consulting Services Group, located in Greenville, South Carolina, explains:
'We site about Dollars 2bn worth of investment a year and about a quarter of
that is European firms coming to the US.'
Smaller consultants may provide a narrower range of services, but their
business is built more directly on personal relationships and trust. Wesley
DeVoto, for example, operates as a 'finder' for British companies interested
in US - and particularly south-eastern US - investments. Mr DeVoto is more
oriented to mergers and acquisitions by British companies wishing to have a
US presence than green field site selection. But his Atlanta-based five-man
shop is a successful niche participant.
The upshot of the increasing competition is that Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer,
acquired in 1990 by financial services giant Prudential, and Fantus, a
division of the PHH Corp, are undergoing a restructure to act more like the
management consulting firms with which they are competing.
Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer, which produces annual studies on favourite business
cities for Fortune magazine, now is focused on location feasibility and
selection, while the implementation of the move, such as housing for
employees, is carried out by its sister company, Prudential Resource
Management, according to Charles Galloway, executive vice-president of MS&amp;B.
Fantus will now have three separate segments, one for private sector
companies in North America and Europe, one for the public sector (advising
on economic development for locations that want to attract investors) and an
international unit that will focus on the Pacific Rim.
The consultants all nonetheless say that business is booming. After the lean
and uncertain years at the start of the 1990s, US companies are once again
making capital investments. And, they say, international business is pouring
in as more companies seek to strategically position themselves to compete in
the North American market.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (5): Santer
departure ends log-jam / Review of the political scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The impending elevation of Mr Jacques Santer from prime minister to the
presidency of the European Commission has given a much-needed injection of
stimulation and vigour to a Luxembourg political scene which in recent years
has been not so much sleepy as comatose.
It is now just over 10 years since Mr Santer led his Christian Social
People's Party (CSV) into coalition with the Luxembourg Socialist Workers'
Party (LSAP) of Mr Jacques Poos, the deputy premier and minister of foreign
affairs.
Through economic boom, downturn and recovery, through the European Single
Act and the Maastricht treaty, and now through three general elections, the
two leaders and their parties have been locked in a cosy embrace.
So small was the impact of the latest election in June that the new
government formed in July comprised the same people - five men and one woman
from each party - who had been members of the outgoing administration. The
only changes were the redistribution of a few portfolios and the promotion
of a Socialist secretary of state to full minister.
The election saw the CSV maintain its position as Luxembourg's biggest party
 -a position it has enjoyed since the second world war, with 21 seats out of
60. The LSAP won 17 seats and the centrist opposition Democratic Party (DP)
12, while an alliance of Green parties and the populist ADR group won five
each.
Apart from a brief period immediately after the war, Luxembourg governments
have been formed by the CSV in coalition with the LSAP and the DP on an
alternating basis. The only exception was between 1974 and 1979 when a
DP-LSAP government headed by Mr Gaston Thorn, later a European Commission
president, pushed the CSV into a rare period of opposition.
Today, though, the habit of alternation seems to have broken down. Not only
is the present coalition now in its third five-year term - a record period -
but its progress has been largely untroubled by squabbling between the two
partners: previously a tradition, especially for so-called 'grand
coalitions' between the socially conservative and economically moderate CSV
and the left-leaning LSAP.
Ten years of co-habitation has smoothed many of the ideological rough edges
of the coalition, such as they exist.
The fact that both coalition partners have close links with a wing of the
trade union movement helps - Mr Jean Spautz, CSV interior minister, and Mr
John Lahure, LSAP health minister, came into government from full-time union
positions. But the political balance has been thrown into question since Mr
Santer, 57, emerged as a compromise candidate to head the EU Commission
after Britain's veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier. His
departure for Brussels promises to spark a wholesale change across the
political spectrum.
Mr Santer's successor, subject to confirmation by a CSV party congress in
December, will be Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, 39, the finance minister, who is
the second-youngest member of the government.
The youngest minister is Mr Alex Bodry, 36, the LSAP defence minister, who
is himself widely tipped as a future leader of his own party if, as many
observers believe, Mr Poos, 59, soon decides to call a halt to his
ministerial career.
And the opposition now has a young face since the DP reacted to its third
consecutive election set-back by replacing Mr Charles Goerens, its
president, with the popular and photogenic mayor of Luxembourg City, Mrs
Lydie-Wurth Polfer, 42, on November 22.
This development reflects the popular vote in June, which seemed to indicate
desire for a change. Mr Santer won fewer personal votes than Mr Juncker in
the European Parliament poll throughout the country, and he also trailed Mrs
Wurth-Polfer in the central district vote for the national parliament. In
the southern district, Mr Bodry came within a few hundred votes of his party
leader.
The CSV might just use the reshuffle entailed by Santer's departure to bring
more young talent into government. New blood is sorely needed, for the CSV
ministerial ranks have a somewhat jaded look. Mr Santer has been a member of
the government for 17 years, Mr Fernand Boden has been family minister and
Jean Spautz has been interior minister for 15 years, and Mr Marc Fischbach
has been education minister for 10. For all his relative youth, Mr Juncker
will shortly complete 12 years in office.
That is the kind of problem the DP can only dream of. The party, which
combines a liberal social philosophy with free-market economics, long played
the same kind of pivotal role in government as Germany's Free Democrats.
Since 1984, however, the party has found itself shut out of government by
the grand coalition and - like the FDP - has struggled to offer a
discernible alternative to rivals which are increasingly fighting over the
centre ground.
Mrs Wurth-Polfer now has the job of articulating and communicating a
distinctive character and message for the DP - no easy task, but a crucial
one. Few observers believe the party could survive a fourth election defeat,
at least in its present form.
One factor which has made life difficult for the traditional opposition is
the rise of single-issue politics. This first made an impact in 1979 when
the leader of the Enroles de Force, Luxembourgers conscripted into the
German armed forces during the 1940-44 occupation, was elected to parliament
in a (successful) bid to win better social security treatment.
In 1989, a group calling itself the Five-Sixths Pensions Action Committee
won four seats in the Chamber of Deputies on a platform consisting
principally of a demand for the upgrading of private-sector pensions to
match those of public employees, who on retirement receive five-sixths of
their final salary.
Despite efforts by the coalition to defuse the issue with new provisions for
private-sector pensions, the group returned to the election fray this year,
now calling itself the ADR (Action Committee for Democracy and Pension
Justice), and won a fifth seat in parliament.
The Greens, too, have benefited from dissatisfaction with the traditional
parties, building up their parliamentary strength from two seats in 1984 to
five this year despite turbulent internal politics which split the movement
in two separate parties for 10 years.
Environmental consciousness has grown strongly in Luxembourg over the past
decade, and the party has benefited from controversial issues such as the
nuclear power station at Cattenom, just over the French border. which helped
the Greens win a first-ever seat in the European Parliament this year. The
party, which is in the process of reuniting, has ambitions of entering the
government in five years' time.
The rise of the Greens, along with the collapse of the communist system in
eastern Europe, also spelled the effective demise of Luxembourg's Communist
Party, which as recently as the early 1970s had five members of parliament
but lost its last remaining seat in June.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (4): Liberal
attitude to broadcasting - Media enterprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Mr Rupert Murdoch, the broadcasting and newspaper mogul, avoided
UK regulations on media ownership by registering his Astra satellite in
Luxembourg, the Grand Duchy has enjoyed a certain notoriety as a base for
media enterprises.
Through the television and radio broadcasts of Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de
Telediffusion (CLT) and the satellite dishes of Societe Europeen des
Satellites (SES), Luxembourg is responsible for broadcasts to more than 50m
Europeans.
This is largely thanks to a very deliberate strategy adopted by the
Luxembourg government to encourage the development of the media industry. As
early as 1931 it decided to allow a private company, Compagnie
Luxembourgeoise de Radioffusion (now CLT) to broadcast from its territory,
rather than creating a public sector broadcaster for its tiny population.
On the other hand, and in spite of the government's attempts to encourage
the broadcasting industry, it would be wrong to exaggerate Luxembourg's
importance as a media base.
But the media is an important sector of the Luxembourg economy. Perhaps the
biggest attraction for incoming investors has been the Grand Duchy's
traditionally liberal approach to broadcasting, in contrast to the highly
regulated media industries common across the rest of the European Union.
According to private operators, key government ministers are available to
answer questions and resolve problems in person, all of which reduces
bureaucracy and leads to speedy decision-making, often tailor-made to suit
the needs of a specific project.
'Luxembourg is small enough to provide you with a very instant access to all
of the decision makers in this country,' says Mr Yves Feltes, of SES. 'In a
new venture like SES, the support of the Grand Duchy has proved to be very
valuable.'
Ms Karin Schintgen of CLT adds: 'It is very important to have the backing of
governments, especially when you consider that in many countries the media
is a political issue.'
Although it is small, the Grand Duchy enjoys sovereign status which means
that along with the rest of Europe, it has been granted an allocation of
satellite frequencies.
In 1983, the government granted a franchise to private investors to use the
satellite frequencies allocated to Luxembourg, which led to the
establishment of one of the country's greatest successes, the Astra
satellite project.
SES, the franchise holder, created Europe's first privately-owned television
satellite system. Today, according to government figures, 55m households all
over Europe can receive a selection of 50 television channels and an even
greater number of radio programmes either directly to their homes with a
satellite dish, or through cable systems.
At the end of this month, SES hopes to launch its fourth dedicated
television satellite. It will be capable of transmitting 16 channels of
television using analogue technology plus two transponders set aside for
experimenting with digital television. There will also be 40 transponders
designed to provide back-up if any of Astra's existing three satellites
should fail.
The liberal environment has bred another well-known European successes. CLT
is now involved in 10 television channels and 13 radio stations across eight
different European countries, mostly under the RTL logo. In addition, it has
become involved in rights acquisitions, film productions, co-productions and
other press activities.
'We feel that being based in Luxembourg has been an asset for the European
expansion of the group,' says Ms Schintgen. 'It is much easier to be
European when you are a Luxembourger. Luxembourg is somehow in between
cultures. The key to success is to stay close to your audiences and you can
only do that if you understand them.
'From here you have a pretty good understanding of what French culture
means, and also of what the German culture means,' she adds.
Meanwhile, the Luxembourg government is doing its best to encourage the
media industry to diversify. In particular, it has focused on production
companies.
Since 1988 it has offered special tax incentives for film-makers, aimed
principally at producers of TV drama series.
To begin with the strategy had only a mixed success. While more money than
expected was spent in the country by mainly small operators, few producers
put down roots. Many producers simply made their films and then left,
contributing nothing to the industry's infrastructure.
Since the early 1990s, the law has been changed to put a greater emphasis on
attracting indoor studio filming.
'The government has tried to encourage investors not only to come to
Luxembourg, but to invest in the infrastructure too,' says Mr Pierre
Goerens, of the audiovisual department of the government. This is gradually
paying off.'
According to the government, the policy has had significant spin-offs
including the establishment of 23 production companies, three animation
studios, four production and three post-production studios.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (2): A place in
the Sunbelt beckons - Martin Dickson examines the strengths and weaknesses
of US regional economies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Go west, young man - but make sure you stop at the Rocky Mountains.
That might be useful modern-day advice to the adventurous and
entrepreneurial, since for the past three years the six states down the
spine of the Rockies, plus the nearby desert states of Arizona and Nevada,
have been the fastest growing region of the US, measured by job creation.
The nation's fastest growing city is the gambling centre of Las Vegas,
Nevada, where employment is expected to rise 7 per cent this year. Utah is
the fastest growing Rocky Mountain state, with 6 per cent job growth last
year.
Contrast that with California, once the golden destination of Americans
heading west to seek their fortunes: it has suffered four years of recession
and this year seems likely to manage only marginal job growth as the economy
shows signs of a painfully slow recovery.
This tale of two regions underscores a fact of considerable significance to
companies deciding where in the US to set up shop. The nation is not so much
a single economy but a collection of regional economies, with their own
distinct personalities, strengths and weaknesses, and differing economic
cycles.
Two broad national trends have been discernible in recent decades: strong
growth in population and national output in the hot, less crowded southern
and western parts of the country - the so-called Sunbelt - thanks partly to
the invention of relatively cheap forms of air-conditioning.
At the same time, population growth has slowed to a trickle in the
traditional industrial heartland - the so-called Rustbelt - and this region
has suffered a decline in manufacturing output, as companies have been lured
by the cheaper production costs of the South and its hostility to organised
labour.
The north-eastern US - New England and New York state - have to some extent
offset this decline in manufacturing with expansion of service industries.
Boston, for example, is a powerhouse of the computer services, medical and
teaching industries, while New York city remains the world's foremost
financial services centre and an important location for the global trade and
media businesses.
The huge amount of intellectual capital located in the north-east and
mid-Atlantic states will continue to give the region a strong comparative
advantage in an era when brain power, rather than brawn, is the key to
competitive advantage in the developed world. It is no accident that in a
survey last year by Fortune magazine of the 'best US cities for knowledge
workers', New York emerged in second place and Boston third. Raleigh/Durham,
in North Carolina, topped the list.
That said, the north-east is only now recovering slowly from a severe
economic downturn between 1989 and 1993, which was brought on by the
contraction of the securities industry, the bursting of a property bubble
and the federal government's sharp cuts in defence spending, which hit the
region disproportionately - just as the boom in 1980s defence spending
helped give it an abnormal boost.
The region is expected to see only modest growth - of around 2.5 per cent -
this year and next. Expansion will be restrained by continuing defence cuts,
falling profits in the securities industry, and the restructuring of large
local companies such as Eastman Kodak and IBM.
Defence cuts and an over-inflated property market have also been a principal
factor in California's long recession, which began in 1990, and at last
seems to be ending. The aerospace industry - long a mainstay of the economy
 -is continuing to cut jobs and some companies are moving operations to
other states, weary of California's high business costs and red tape.
The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a research
organisation which has long been bullish on the state's prospects, insists
that the state has strong long-term potential, based on foreign trade,
high-technology, professional services, tourism and entertainment.
But it argues that the principal threat to job and income growth is 'the
lack of a strategy to prioritise and fund critical public investments, such
as infrastructure and education'.
Further up the west coast, the state of Washington is also suffering a
slowdown in growth as the recession in the civil aircraft industry forces
Seattle-based Boeing to cut back on production. However, Washington, which
enjoyed above average growth in the early 1990s, remains one of the more
attractive US business locations, with Seattle often near the top of a
locational league tables.
The state has strong positions in some of the world's leading edge
high-technology industries, strong ties with the booming Asian Pacific Rim
countries, and great beauty.
For now, however,the fastest growing regions of the US are in the south
and/or centre of the country.
The Rocky Mountains are expected to show growth of around 5 per cent this
year, dipping perhaps to 4 per cent in 1995, thanks to an influx of
manufacturers from other regions seeking lower operating costs and
professionals who have been freed by the fax and telephone modem to work
wherever they choose. Many of these so-called 'lone eagles' prefer to live
amid the stunning physical beauty of the mountains and deserts.
The Rocky Mountain expansion is admittedly from a very modest base - the
region accounts for no more than 5 per cent of US GDP - and the influx is
pushing up labour and housing costs.
Texas, which suffered a severe slump in the mid-1980s when the price of oil
tumbled, has since diversified away from the sector, into areas such as
high-technology and environmental services, and the state is now growing a
little above the national average.
Cities such as Houston, Dallas and Austin have become centres of
high-technology excellence and the state will benefit greatly from its
proximity to Mexico as the North American Free Trade Agreement increases
trans-border economic activity.
The upper-midwest - an area which encompasses much of the traditional
Rustbelt and ranges from Ohio in the east to Iowa in the west - is also
thriving and has transformed itself over the past 20 years.
At one time it appeared to epitomise the problems of American heavy
manufacturing industry: its car, motorbike, machine tool, steel and
equipment manufacturers were all losing out to Asian rivals and the region
looked to be in irreversible decline.
The machine tool and motorbike industries remain shadows of their former
self, but the US motor and equipment industries have become much more
competitive operations and the region has diversified into a wide range of
leading edge industrial sectors and adopted a much more international
outlook.
The region neither soared during the 1980s with the defence boom nor
suffered so much as the east and west coasts in the defence/property
downturn of the early 1990s, and seems set to maintain solid, stable growth
of 4 per cent or more this year and 3.5 per cent next year.
That rate of expansion could put it close to the south-east, which is
growing faster than any region but the Rockies, thanks to population growth,
company relocations, and greenfield factory construction, such as BMW's
plant in South Carolina and a Mercedes plant being built in Alabama.
Atlanta, the unofficial regional capital, will get an additional boost from
the 1996 Olympics, to which it is playing host. Florida is suffering from a
sluggish tourist industry but is emerging as an increasingly important
centre for Latin American trade.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (3): Foreigners
welcomed with open arms - Mexico / Damian Fraser assesses the prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<TEXT>
With its access to the US and Canadian markets guaranteed by membership of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico expects to become a haven
for foreign companies in search of a cheap labour force and a stable
investor-friendly country with more than 85m people.
In the first seven months since the treaty came into effect, there are
already signs that Mexico's ambitions are being fulfilled. Despite the
tremendous political uncertainly before the August presidential election,
direct foreign investment rose by 32 per cent to reach Dollars 8.035bn
compared with the same period last year.
The largest share of the foreign investment - 62 per cent - came from the US
as in previous years. But the passage of Nafta has not increased the US
proportion of investment. High-profile non-US companies such as BMW, Honda,
and Labbat, the Canadian brewery, have recently announced plans to invest in
Mexico, raising slightly the share of non-US investment in the country this
year.
Under Nafta, Mexico, the US and Canada have agreed to remove almost all
trade and non-trade barriers over 15 years. With Mexican wages roughly one
fifth of those in the US, economists expect many US and Canadian companies
to move their labour intensive operations south of the border  - continuing
a trend towards economic integration that began well before Nafta was
proposed.
Mexico further agreed to liberalise its foreign investment law in the Nafta
negotiations. Under the new laws, Mexico's financial sector is open to US
and Canadian investment, red tape on obtaining approval in other sectors is
significantly reduced, and many restrictions on investing in border and
coastal zones are lifted. Most of the concessions offered to the US and
Canada have subsequently been granted to other countries.
The big three US car companies were among the first to spot the advantages
of investing in Mexico and exporting parts or finished vehicles to the US
and Latin America, and have plans to increase their investment in Mexico in
coming years. They have now been joined by many German and Japanese auto
manufacturers, who have recently announced their intention to make large new
investments in the country, in part so as to be able to meet higher local
content rules prescribed under Nafta.
A study commissioned by the Mexican Investment Board - the
government-sponsored investment agency that is the first port of call for
foreign companies moving to Mexico - reckons electronic, building materials,
apparel and mining are the other sectors of most probable interest to
international companies seeking to locate south of the border. The study
concluded that Mexico's pro-business climate, quality of government, access
to the US and its cheap work force, were among the main factors attracting
companies to the country.
Mexico's other principal attraction was the growing domestic market of 85m
consumers. So far most companies seeking to sell to Mexicans, such as
Labbat, the Canadian brewery, Bell Atlantic, the telephone company,
Wal-Mart, the US retail chain, have entered the market with Mexican
partners. But some, such as the 20 foreign banks which have applied to open
subsidiaries, are going it alone.
After subdued economic growth for the past couple of years, the foreign
investors looking at the internal economy are hoping for a recovery next
year. The government has forecast an expansion of about 4 per cent, regarded
as well within reach by most independent economists. Inflation, meanwhile,
is expected by the government to fall to less than 7 per cent this year, and
to 4 per cent next year.
But despite the evident attractions of investing in Mexico, many foreign
companies have found out that doing business there is more expensive than
might appear. Workers on average are considerably less productive than in
the US, infrastructure is poor (especially in railways and ports), the cost
of capital is high, regulations governing ownership are unclear and law
enforcement unpredictable. While the federal government is considered
helpful to foreigners, state governments, with some notable exceptions, are
often bureaucratic, and prone to corruption.
Nor does Mexico enter into bidding wars for companies seeking to receive
benefits for locating in the country. Companies (foreign and domestic alike)
receive modest federal tax breaks for new investments, and for buying
anti-pollution equipments. State governments can give land away or help
train workers. But, generally, the government opposes giving discretionary
benefits to foreign companies planning to invest in Mexico.
Some of the obstacles to foreign location in Mexico will be addressed by the
incoming government of Ernesto Zedillo. His administration has pledged to
boost spending on vocational training for workers, to commit to a
significant expansion of the country's infrastructure, to lower interest
rates by reducing inflation still further, and to enforce the law with
respect to property rights and application of regulations.
There is little doubting the importance Mexico's government now attaches to
foreign investment, and the open arms with which it welcomes any who are
willing to set up operations in the country.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (2): Firm ideas on
the Duchy's EU role / Political profile of Jean-Claude Juncker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Jacques Santer takes over as president of the European Commission in
January, his successor as prime minister of Luxembourg will be Jean-Claude
Juncker, a politician of calibre and intellect with firm ideas on Luxembourg
and Europe, and on the Grand Duchy's place in the evolving Union.
Mr Juncker, currently wearing the two hats of finance and employment
minister, will bring a change of style and, aged 39, an infusion of energy
to the job. More private, tougher, and less of a glad-hander than the
emollient Mr Santer, his main challenges will be to consolidate and develop
Luxembourg's niche economy, and defend its unique position within the EU.
The news that Mr Juncker would succeed Mr Santer - still to be formally
confirmed, as indeed is Mr Santer's endorsement by the European Parliament
in December - has been welcomed in Luxembourg. In the June general
elections, the young finance minister, who is also chairman of the Christian
Social People's Party (CSV), the dominant partner in the Christian
Democrat-Socialist coalition which has governed the Grand Duchy since 1984,
out-polled all other candidates. This, moreover, was achieved in his native
south, traditionally a Socialist stronghold.
He comes from the left of the CSV, and freely acknowledges that 'I could be
a Socialist in the Luxembourg context.' One of the seven children of a
steelworker and trade union militant, Mr Juncker trained as a lawyer at
Strasbourg university, although his father had expected him to be a priest.
He only practised law for five months, however, before being hand-picked by
Mr Pierre Werner, the then Luxembourg leader and pioneer of European
monetary union, as secretary of the CSV parliamentary group, a sort of
whip's job formerly held by Mr Santer. In 1982 he became a junior minister,
joining the cabinet in 1984 aged 29.
The one setback in this seemingly effortless advance was a 1989 car crash
which nearly killed him, but, in the judgment of one colleague, strengthened
his personality and (lightly worn) religious faith.
Politicians from across the spectrum, bankers and businessmen unfailingly
allude to Mr Juncker's intelligence, integrity and broad mind, although some
see him as 'a bit arrogant', as one foreign banker put it. Another leading
banker says Mr Juncker's gift is 'the ability to grasp very practical detail
as well as conceptual problems.'
This makes him rather like Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission
president to whom he was close, and who two years ago tried to persuade Mr
Juncker to go to Brussels to a 'super-commissioner' job in charge of
economic and social policy.
He has also shown himself capable of taking tough decisions, including
recent reforms to Luxembourg's health insurance and tax systems, and his
1991 attempt, as chairman of the 12 finance ministers under the Luxembourg
Euro-presidency, to cajole a compromise on the delicate question of indirect
tax harmonisation.
In the EU, where he sits in two councils, he has a wealth of contacts and
widespread respect. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a fellow Christian Democrat
whose peer he will now be, refers to him affectionately as 'Junior'. He is
forthright and sometimes heterodox.
He is also a close observer of developments in partner states, especially in
the Big Three of France, Germany and the UK and, according to colleagues, is
not infrequently the forger of compromises between them. 'There is no other
way for Luxembourg but to have a good relationship with France and Germany
and our other partners,' he says.
In 1996, the EU will review the Maastricht treaty and its constitutional
arrangements, looking to reform decision-making and tighten intra-Union
links before expanding further into east and central Europe. The apparent
anomaly of a mini-state such as Luxembourg having almost equal rights with
big nations, with a veto and a commissioner in Brussels, will be open to
debate, along with the feasibility of a 'multi-speed' path to EU
integration.
Before then, pressure will grow on Luxembourg to impose a withholding tax on
investment income. Powerful neighbours such as Germany believe the lack of
such a tax for foreigners gives Luxembourg's finance centre an unfair
advantage, attracting walls of 'their' money.
The fear is that opponents of the Grand Duchy's fiscal regime will link the
withholding tax issue to Luxembourg's rights within the Union.
'One of the founding principles of post-war Europe,' Mr Juncker argues as a
leader of one of the founding nations of the Euro-club, 'is that we have the
same rights.' He acknowledges, however, that as a small state, 'we can't
make full use of those rights. We could use the veto maybe once every 10
years; everyone knows that Britain, France and Germany will always have
greater rights.'
But while relaxed about a dilution of blocking powers, Mr Juncker is adamant
that 'we can't accept a system in which Luxembourg didn't have a
commissioner.' That danger has for the moment receded, with Mr Santer at the
helm in Brussels, and his successor is more worried about the 'multi-speed'
Europe debate sparked off last month by the German Christian Democrats.
He reasons that political union must be deepened in 1996, and that the
opt-outs from Maastricht on monetary union (Emu) and social policy given to
the UK have set a damaging multi-speed precedent. He believes 'our social
ambition is too low in comparison to our other ambitions', for Emu and a
common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and eventual common defence.
He does not want to see the existing 16 members - assuming Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Norway join in January - split up, with a so-called hard-core
going ahead faster. Luxembourg, the only EU member now within the Maastricht
debt, deficit and inflation criteria for Emu, would certainly be in the
first wave towards a single currency.
'It would be easier for seven or eight members to go on together as a
hard-core,' he says, 'but not in the really hard (policy) fields, such as
defence,' Mr Juncker argues. Moreover, he does not want to see the UK, or
the southern states, falling out of the Euro-convoy. A hard-core 'would make
it very difficult to bring the British back to the centre of Europe,' he
says, adding: 'For all the differences we have with the UK, it is a part of
Europe, and it brings a dimension to Europe which I'm not prepared to lose.'
On the tax issue, Mr Juncker says: 'We are no longer in the blocking field
but in the proposing field.' Luxembourg has argued that a withholding tax
harmonisation should extend to other OECD countries such as Switzerland and
Austria, in order to prevent a capital outflow from the Union. But it is
widely assumed that Luxembourg's new prime minister will start preparing for
the time when the finance centre will no longer have the tax advantage,
through policies which exploit other skills and advantages.
'Juncker is the man to shake Luxembourgers out of their complacency,' judges
a local journalist. The prime minister-in-waiting himself says: 'We have to
concentrate on the objective advantages we can offer. It's not wise to
concentrate on the tax difference.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (3): Green with
ambition / Political profile of Jup Weber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jup Weber, the first Green that Luxembourg has sent to the European
Parliament, is a man of ambition who would like to work himself out of a
job, at least a political one, writes David Gardner.
'I said 10 years ago that my dream was that in 10 years' time we wouldn't be
necessary any more. But the fact is that we are still very, very necessary,'
Mr Weber says.
Before he retires from the fray, he can envisage an eventual stint as
environment minister in one of the coalitions that habitually govern the
Grand Duchy, none of which have yet extended to ecologists.
Mr Weber, a genial 44-year-old forestry engineer, first won election to
Luxembourg's national assembly in 1984 as part of the first wave of
ecologists entering parliament across Europe, or at least the more
prosperous and environmentally aware northern parts.
It is not difficult to see why Luxembourg - the richest European Union
country on a per capita basis and the only country in the Union where growth
did not turn negative in the recent recession - should feel it can afford a
green conscience.
But this is not to deny the achievement of Mr Weber as that conscience's
main expression, particularly in unifying the fissiparous Green constituency
in the Grand Duchy around his own pragmatic, or 'Realo', faction.
The Greens, along with the Christian Democrats and Socialists - who have
formed three successive government coalitions since 1984 - and the Liberals,
can now lay claim to be mainstream players in Luxembourg politics. Indeed,
the Luxembourgeois Greens, polling some 12 per cent in the Grand Duchy's
national and European elections last June, got the best score of any
environmental party in the Union.
This reflects not only the comfort of prosperity, but acute ecological
challenges facing Luxembourg which, as a micro-state at the junction of
France, Germany and Belgium, has only a loose grip on environmental levers.
Citizens fret about motorways and waste dumping, greenhouse gases and the
ring of their neighbours' nuclear power plants surrounding them.
The already extensive motorway system is being extended and widened, partly
to ease the congestion caused by high per capita car ownership and the flood
of foreigners who commute to work in Luxembourg - but also, it seems to many
residents, for the benefit of through traffic and road freight which just
uses Luxembourg as a motorway.
There has been virulent local opposition to a new waste recycling plant
planned for Mamer near the border with Belgium. Because of its tiny size,
Luxembourg traditionally exported its waste to neighbours for recycling, but
it is bowing to EU pressure for waste management close to source.
Luxembourgers worry about emissions from their steel industry, the original
source of their wealth, which even in much-slimmed-down form makes their
country the highest per capita producer of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere in the EU, at more than four times the Union average.
The link between Arbed, the large Luxembourg steel manufacturer, and
imported nuclear-generated electricity, is one of Mr Weber's particular bete
noires.
Arbed, as part of its restructuring, is converting to electric arc furnaces
and will be buying in electricity from Belgian and French nuclear plants,
including Cattenom, just over the French border and 25km from where Mr Weber
lives in Junglinster.
The Green leader sees this as long-term endorsement of the nuclear power
option - with the difference that Luxembourg has no regulatory control over
the actual plants producing the electricity. Instead, he wants gas turbine
plants built inside Luxembourg.
'I can see being environment and energy minister in five to 10 years time,'
he says confidently, 'and going to Paris to ask them to close it (Cattenom),
and being told, quite correctly, that Arbed depends on it.'
Another of Mr Weber's prime targets has been the Grand Duchy's petrol
prices, significantly below EU rates because of minimal excise taxes.
He wants an end to the 'scandalous gasoline tourism' this generates through
drivers filling up in the Grand Duchy.
In the June elections, the Greens called for immediate equalisation with
neighbouring petrol prices, and then incremental tax rises thereafter.
Opponents painted this as a price quadrupling, which 'cost us two seats in
the Luxembourg parliament,' Mr Weber claims.
Yet he believes that an important battle was won, because he is convinced
that when Mr Jean-Claude Juncker, the current finance and labour minister,
takes over as prime minister in December, eco-taxes on petrol and
non-recyclable packaging and containers will gradually be introduced.
'I've been preaching for 10 years that we should have eco-taxes, and now
they're going to do it,' Mr Weber predicts confidently.
Scaremongering did not prevent the Greens winning their coveted seat in the
European Parliament, which Mr Weber regards as 'a fantastic instrument for
international networking.'
He has long advised the Green group at Strasbourg on forestry conservation,
and will now be working with the parliament's environment, agriculture, and
external economic relations committees.
Mr Weber, trained as a forestry engineer at the University of Vienna and
with a background in Luxembourg's own forestry administration, has combined
politics with half-time work for his own consultancy, presently engaged in
pilot forestry management projects in Siberia and Canada.
Luxembourg law defines an MP's role as a half-time profession requiring an
average 20 hours a week; 'a very good system for avoiding addiction to
politics,' Mr Weber smiles, and one he intends to continue as an MEP. 'I'm
involved in a fascinating project in Siberia and I'm not going to give that
up,' he says firmly.
He has already given an earnest indication of his independence at
Strasbourg, annoying his fellow Euro-Greens by being the only one of their
number to vote in July for Mr Jacques Santer, the outgoing Luxembourg prime
minister, as successor to Mr Jacques Delors presiding over the European
Commission.
'I had fierce problems,' he recalls, 'but I too was annoyed with their
argument that a small country equals a weak president.' For a Luxembourg
Green, small is beautiful, but - as the ecological challenges which the
Grand Duchy faces demonstrate - it is also problematic.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (1): Motor
industry sets pace for investors - The race is on to expand operations in a
trading area which, thanks to Nafta, has 360m consumers. Martin Dickson
examines the prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no more clearcut illustration of the importance of North America as
a business location for European and Asian corporations than a string of
recent investments in the motor industry.
Toyota, the largest Japanese vehicle manufacturer, announced recently that
it would be raising its vehicle production in the region by nearly 50 per
cent over the next two years, taking its total output from 533,000 units to
790,000 a year.
The increase will come from its existing manufacturing plant in Kentucky,
where it has already put in place the necessary extra production capacity;
from New United Motor Manufacturing, its California-based joint venture with
General Motors; and from Toyota Motor Manufacturing in Canada.
In July, Honda, Japan's third largest carmaker (and the first to establish a
manufacturing presence in the US, in the early 1980s), announced that it
planned an 18 per cent increase in North American vehicle capacity over the
next three years and a 50 per cent boost in engine-making capacity by 1998.
Again, the expansion will take place at its existing factories in Ohio and
Ontario, Canada.
The Japanese companies want to increase their US output partly because the
rise in the value of the yen, relative to the dollar, has made it uneconomic
to import many vehicles from Asia, and partly because Tokyo is under strong
US pressure to reduce its trade imbalance with America.
But they are hardly alone in their expansion plans: over the past two years
two German luxury car manufacturers - BMW and Mercedes-Benz - have both
announced plans to locate in the US, their first manufacturing plants
outside Germany. BMW has built a factory in South Carolina, which produced
its first vehicles last month, while a Mercedes plant is going up in
Alabama.
Both have been lured by America's relatively low labour costs (partly a
function of dollar weakness), by the skills of its workforce, and by the
competitive edge they hope they will gain from being direct participants in
the world's most cut-throat vehicle market, and one of the most innovative.
Like the Japanese, their new US production will be aimed both at domestic
consumers and at the export market.
The increasing motor industry investment is being replicated in many other
sectors, and for broadly similar reasons: no company seeking a global
presence can ignore either the size or fiercely entrepreneurial character of
the US market.
For the US remains by far the world's largest market speaking a single
language, while this year's implementation of the North American Free Trade
Agreement has created a trading area, also embracing Canada and Mexico, of
more than 360m consumers. Nafta is starting to have a significant impact on
location decisions.
Chrysler is building a new Dollars 300m vehicle assembly plant in Mexico,
and analysts expect employment in the nation's motor industry to rise from
160,000 today to 210,000 by 1998.
Foreign direct investment in the US grew remarkably in the 1980s. This was
partly through the start-up of greenfield plants, notably from Japanese car
manufacturers, but much more so through the takeover of existing US
companies. Direct foreign investment grew from Dollars 83bn in 1980 to
Dollars 403.7bn in 1990.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the growth rate dropped sharply, due to
recession and to alternative investment opportunities opened up by the
economic integration of western Europe, the collapse of the Soviet empire,
an economic boom in several Pacific Rim nations and an improved economic
climate in Latin America.
Foreign spending on acquiring or establishing US businesses totalled Dollars
15.3bn in 1992, down roughly 45 per cent on the previous year and the fourth
consecutive year of decline. It was the lowest total since the Dollars
8.09bn in 1983.
However, over the past 18 months there has been a distinct revival in US
inward investment. Expenditure in 1993 bounced back to Dollars 26.2bn, while
total foreign direct investment, at historic cost, reached Dollars 445.3bn.
This year has seen a flurry of European takeovers or sizeable investments in
US companies, including a Dollars 5.3bn cash bid by Roche of Switzerland for
drugs company Syntex and a Dollars 2.3bn offer by SmithKline Beecham for
drug wholesaler Diversified Pharmaceutical Services.
But where in North America should a foreign company locate its operations?
For those acquiring or expanding a US presence through a takeover, there is
little choice: you set up shop where the acquired company has its
facilities.
But those companies establishing a greenfield presence, or thinking of
changing their existing North American locations, face a complicated
trade-off involving, among many factors: the type of business they are
engaged in; the markets they are seeking to serve; the type of labour force
they need to attract; relative wage/real estate/utility and cost-of-living
expenses; transport and other infrastructure requirements; and available
government incentives.
Despite this wide range of variables, some broad trends can be identified.
One of the most significant is the growth of financial assistance packages
over the past few years as US states and municipalities try to woo
businesses. Jim Schriner, of PHH Fantus Consulting, a leading business
location advisory group, says: 'The incentive market is very hot right now
and will probably stay so for a couple of years.'
The most startling incentive package is that awarded by Alamaba to Mercedes:
an initial Dollars 253m, with tax breaks over 25 years that could be worth
an additional Dollars 230m.
More recently, the state of Iowa gave Ipsco, a Canadian steel group, a
package of tax and other incentives worth Dollars 73m over 20 years to
clinch the location of a steel mill. And last month Connecticut gave some
Dollars 120m of incentives over 10 years to persuade Swiss Bank Corporation
to move its US headquarters from Manhattan, New York, to the suburban city
of Stamford.
Despite the growth of incentives, most companies consider these towards the
end of their site search, as one of several factors which can tip the
balance between one area and another. Relocation advisory groups argue that
to focus on government concessions ahead of more fundamental business
factors is to risk making short-term judgments which could prove costly in
the long run.
More fundamental business location trends include a continuing shift of
businesses from city centres to surrounding suburbs.
Take, for example, Swiss Bank's recent decision to move to Stamford,
Connecticut, from New York city, and Mastercard's plan to move its
headquarters from Manhattan to New York state's nearby Westchester county.
In New York, this trend partly reflects rising Manhattan property rental
prices as the city recovers from the severe recession of 1989-1993. That, in
turn, underlines the fact that, despite the run of defections, cosmopolitan
New York remains a crucial centre for the financial services industry,
international trade and media industries.
That said, manufacturing and services industries that do not need to be in
the relatively costly north-eastern US are continuing to switch to less
expensive centres in the south, midwest and west.
And on the west coast, there is a trend for businesses to relocate from
California to fast-growing desert and Rocky Mountain states, notably
Arizona, Nevada and Utah. Many are leaving the expensive, socially-troubled
Los Angeles region.
Nafta is also starting to influence location decisions. Richard Greene, of
Ernst &amp; Young's international corporate real estate consulting service,
says: 'The biggest thing to have changed in the last couple of years is
Nafta. We are seeing foreign companies - Canadian and Mexican as well as
European and Asian - re-examining where in America to do business. They are
looking for the best place to access the entire North American market.'
Mr Schriner of PHH says that it has seen 'very little work resulting from
Nafta. Companies that want to be in Mexico already have a presence in
Mexico.'
But he adds that many companies are still organised on a country basis,
rather than a regional basis, with three separate corporate staffs for the
US, Canada and Mexico, and these will have to be cut eventually to one.
'Companies have not dealt with this yet, but they will have to.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (1): International
gaze falls on mini-state - In 1996, when the EU reviews its constitutional
rules, there will be pressure to downgrade the influence of smaller member
states
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Luxembourg is a tiny, placid country, ostensibly content to drip with
prosperity, exploiting its economic niche at the conjunction of France,
Germany and Belgium, and punching above its weight as a founder-member of
what is now the European Union.
But suddenly it is under international gaze, after its prime minister, Mr
Jacques Santer, was vaulted unexpectedly this summer into the presidency of
the European Commission, to succeed the powerful Mr Jacques Delors in the
new year.
The Grand Duchy will need influence at the Euro-court. In 1996, when the EU
reviews its power-sharing and constitutional rules ahead of planned
integration of eastern Europe around the end of the century, there will be
pressure to downgrade the influence of smaller member states - not to
mention mini-states such as Luxembourg.
And ahead of that, EU pressure is already rising to persuade Luxembourg as a
fast-growing financial centre to harmonise its low tax regime with its
partners. Its powerful neighbours, led by Germany, resent the outflow of
capital into the Grand Duchy, lured by its virtually zero withholding tax on
foreigners and banking secrecy laws.
'I fear that the two issues will be linked, and that will be very difficult
for us,' acknowledges Mr Francois Biltgen, a parliamentary leader of the
Christian Democrats, who have governed in coalition with the Socialists
since 1984.
But more important than having Mr Santer in Brussels is the virtual
certainty that he will be succeeded as Luxembourg's prime minister by Mr
Jean-Claude Juncker, a tough and intelligent politician who is widely
respected on the Euro-circuit.
Mr Juncker, who at 39 will be the EU's youngest premier, is presently
Luxembourg's finance and employment minister. He has won a high reputation
among his peers by dint of intellectual ability, straightforward argument,
and a gift for building consensus within the quarrelsome Euro-club.
Mr Delors himself tried hard to persuade Mr Juncker to join the Commission
and, according to some insiders, once thought of him as his possible
successor. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a fellow Christian Democrat,
affectionately calls Mr Juncker 'Junior'.
As finance minister, a portfolio he may well retain as prime minister, Mr
Juncker has not shirked hard decisions. In recent years he has started
reform of health insurance and last year completed an overhaul of taxation,
reducing the burden on middle-income households and small to medium-sized
companies, while keeping a tight grip on spending.
The ruling coalition has given Luxembourg an almost unbroken cycle of growth
in the past 10 years, as well as political stability. Its planners now
foresee national output rising by 3 per cent and more to the end of the
century. Luxembourg is alone among its partners in meeting all the
Maastricht treaty convergence criteria for economic and monetary union
(Emu), notably through government debt at a mere 7.9 per cent of gross
domestic product, and the budget in virtual equilibrium. At the same time,
it manages to devote a high average of 10 per cent of public spending to
capital investment in telecommunications, transport and energy.
Yet prudent stewardship of the public purse is but a small part of the
explanation why Luxembourg has the highest per capita income in the EU.
Dependent on the economic performance of its neighbours, it nonetheless
consistently outperforms them; growth rates never turned negative during the
recent recession, and unemployment, high by local standards at 3 per cent,
remains at about a quarter of the EU average.
Luxembourgers have prospered by being abnormally fast to identify
opportunities for their economy. This is all the more remarkable given that
the Grand Duchy has surrendered many conventional tools of macroeconomic
management. Control of exchange rate and monetary policy is vested in its
72-year-old economic and monetary union with Belgium and, by virtue of its
geographic position at west Europe's heart, its frontiers were open long
before the advent of the Single Market.
In the mid-19th century, Luxembourg was among the first to set up an
advanced steel industry, the initial origin of its wealth. 'It is a skill
they have historically: to see a niche and go for it,' says Mr Rodney
Williams of Flemings, one of the largest managers of the flood of investment
funds located in Luxembourg.
Through agility and inventiveness, the Grand Duchy has in more recent
decades become: a pioneer of the Eurobond market; a launch-pad for the cable
and satellite TV business; a leading personal finance centre through
customised banking services and tax-efficient saving through investment
funds.
In the latter and other similar cases, Luxembourg enacted the new
Euro-legislation on mutual funds (the USITS directive) well ahead of its
competitors. The number of funds tripled between 1987 and the end of last
year from 405 to 1,175, with the volume of investment rocketing from
LFr1,135bn to LFr9,967bn.
'As a government, we introduce quickly and in advance,' says Mr Juncker.
But, he cautions, 'as a small country we don't have the freedom to make
mistakes. Every 10 years we have to invent something new, something which
the others have not seen yet. And if you back the wrong horse you're dead.'
The finance centre, generating 15 per cent of GDP directly and probably
double that once ancillary services from lawyers to restaurants are added
in, was definitely a good horse to back.
Bankers and politicians are divided on whether the German-led drive to
enforce a withholding tax, and possibly even to erode the finance centre's
other precious asset of banking secrecy, could seriously damage Luxembourg.
'The withholding tax is the first wall of the fortress, but the inner wall
is (banking) secrecy', says one leading banker. But the signs are that the
government is bracing for eventual tax harmonisation. 'We have to behave in
a manner so that we are prepared to live without the withholding tax,'
argues one senior minister. More cautiously, Mr Juncker argues that the
finance centre is close to critical mass and must learn to trade on its
skills and experience. 'We are becoming richer and richer, but we are not
more intelligent, we don't work harder, and we are no better than the
others. We have to explain this to our people.'
Because of its partners' perception that Luxembourg gets rich by exploiting
loopholes, the government is wary of betting too heavily on any one horse,
and thinks ahead about diversification. For example, with an already dense
network of small to medium-sized industry, Luxembourg is now targeting
high-tech, high valued-added foreign companies, offering a generous tax
regime along with its skilled, multilingual labour force.
'We're very vulnerable, and we've always needed more courage and imagination
to defend our vital interests,' Mr Juncker says.
He will also need courage and inventiveness to defend Luxembourg's position
in 1996. As the Grand Duchy's political establishment sees it, the
priorities are: to preserve the EU balance between big and small states;
ensure that Luxembourg retains its right to a commissioner when the EU
expands further; avoid too overt a correlation between country size and
population and voting power in the EU's Council of Ministers; and, above
all, to avoid all this getting enmeshed with the wrangle over withholding
tax.
None of this will be easy, but the very fact that the EU had to resort to
Luxembourg and Mr Santer to resolve the Delors succession crisis - after the
UK vetoed Belgian premier Jean-Luc Dehaene at the Corfu summit in June -
greatly strengthens the Grand Duchy's position.
'It is a sign that small countries make up an important part of the cement
of the Union,' says Mr Biltgen. 'Just his being there wins part of the
argument for (Luxembourg) having a commissioner.' But altogether typically
for a Luxembourger, he quickly adds that 'we have to look for compromise
solutions.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: APV active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
APV, the food processing equipment group which took the market's breath away
last month with a profits warning and a dividend cut, shed 1 1/2 to 72 1/2 p
on 3.1m turnover following the resignation of Mr Clive Strowger, its chief
executive.
The shares, 138p earlier this year, are now just 1 1/2 above their 1994 low
and on understandable tenterhooks ahead of the completion of an internal
operating report due to be submitted to the management towards the end of
next month.
Household products group Paterson Zochonis tumbled 51 to 438p as the group
warned that future profits would be hit by problems in Nigeria.
Focus on the latest CBI survey of retail trades lay behind the moves of
several stores stocks, with Boots, the chemists chain, turning around from
being 5 up to show a net loss of 4 at 527p as it was reported that sales
volume in the sector had fallen. But Lloyds Chemists was boosted by 8 to
321p as the company held presentations in London. At the other end of the
scale, a boost in clothing and shoe sales lifted Sears 2 to 107 1/2 p.
Bank shares attracted heavy interest throughout the session, with NatWest
Securities promoting a bull story in the sector by upgrading its stance to
outperform and recommending the 'lower rated domestic stocks' - National
Westminster, TSB and Bank of Scotland - and shifting Abbey National from
'reduce' to 'hold'.
NatWest bank ratings are at their lowest levels since the mid-1980s, the
operating environment is improving and there is increasing scope for value
to be passed to shareholders through increased dividends or share buy-backs.
TSB was the best performer of the group, moving up 2 to 220p, while Bank of
Scotland settled 3 off at 205p and NatWest 6 lower at 501p.
Royal Bank of Scotland, up 6 at 431p, outpaced the rest of the banking
sector and was one of the best performers in the FT-SE 100 after buy
recommendations from Credit Lyonnais Laing, the bank's own broker, and UBS.
HSBC rallied a penny to 717p after the bout of selling pressure induced by
the recent weakness of the dollar. Dealers noted heavy switching from the
Hong Kong-registered stock to the UK-registered stock, where the spread came
in from around 22p to 5p, the narrowest margin for around six months.
There were some hefty losses across the board in the 'recs', with the market
reacting to suggestions that a big switch programme, involving big blocks of
most of the 'recs', was about to be activated, with one big institution
looking to move large sums into gilts.
Property group Artesian Estates, part of the Business Expansion Scheme and
introduced by broker Peel Hunt, closed at 71p in the first day of dealings.
P&amp;0, which has had a strong run since the middle of last week, ran out of
steam yesterday following a negative move by James Capel, which switched its
stance from 'hold' to 'sell' and pushed the shares down 23 to 615p in 4.1m
turnover.
The stock now looks to be subject to a significant two-way pull, with UBS
and Panmure Gordon known to favour P&amp;0, which with debt gearing roughly
double the Footsie average is looked upon as an interest rate-sensitive
play.
British Aerospace, up 28 on Monday on speculation that GEC was teeing up a
takeover bid, retreated 14 to 484p in spite of the fact that the marketplace
continued to place some store in the rumour. GEC slipped 8 to 287p.
BAe has made an agreed all-share offer worth 1335p for submarines group
VSEL, a deal that has flushed out GEC has a declared potential
counter-bidder. The feeling in the market is that GEC could comfortably
leap-frog this situation and aim straight for BAe. VSEL eased 8 to 1315p.
Europe's largest aircraft and passenger handling group, Servisair, held its
ground on the first day of share trading in London. Sixty per cent of the
shares were floated at 135p apiece by Securum, the Swedish asset management
group.
The stock began trading at a 3p premium and closed unchanged at 138p.
Carlton Communications added 3 at 844p as Goldman Sachs published a note
pointing out the short term value in the stock.

FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise hints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A generally weak oil sector, depressed by the recent slippage in oil prices
as the Iraq/Kuwait border worries receded, was featured by a sudden bout of
selling pressure in Enterprise Oil after rumours that it was about to launch
an Pounds 800m-plus all-paper bid for Ampolex, the Australian oil group.
Enterprise said it never commented on market rumours but sources close to
Enterprise described the story as 'without foundation'.
The stories swept the market in midsession. Enterprise shares opened around
385p but fell away to close a net 8 lower at 377p on unremarkable turnover
of 1.5m. Oil specialists said a bid seemed unlikely but would fulfil many of
the objectives evident when Enterprise unsuccessfully bid for Lasmo earlier
tbis year, citing Ampol's strongly rising production profile and good
assets.
British Petroleum fell 7 1/2 to 414p on 6.6m traded, while Shell Transport
receded 8 to 722p. Revived worries about British Gas's dividend policy,
which were thought to have been laid to rest at the company's strategy
meeting with analysts and institutions at the end of September, came back to
haunt Gas shares, which relinquished 5 1/2 at 286p.

Pharmaceuticals heavyweight Glaxo Holdings led the fall in dollar influenced
stocks yesterday. The US currency's two-year low against sterling, combined
with bearish sector-related data, saw Glaxo shares marked down 23 before
rallying to close 16 1/2 off at 598 1/2 p after 5.4m traded.
The drop was accentuated by some slightly disappointing third-quarter
figures from US leader Merck. Also, a sharp fall in US sales of SmithKline
Beecham's ulcer drug Tagamet, highlighted in the group's third-quarter
figures, had prompted fears that Glaxo's headline ulcer product Zantac could
be facing stiff competition as well. However, it was pointed out that recent
prescription data showed Zantac sales holding up well in the US.
SmithKline declined 6 to 429p, while anticipation that Cadbury Schweppes
might buy its Ribena and Lucozade arm saw Cadbury firm a penny to 445p.
Wellcome receded 9 to finish at 671p.

FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 3,100 mark lost again in
nervous selling - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renewed weakness in domestic bonds, together with a general nervousness
towards the US dollar, drove the UK stock market well below the 3,100 mark
on the FT-SE 100-share Index yesterday. Fears that the next rise in base
rates might come sooner than expected was prompted by a report from members
of the Confederation of British Industry of a very sharp rise in retail
sales last month. This morning brings the official retail sales statistics
for September.
Trading volume remained poor and the closing picture was gloomy rather than
threatening, with the pharmaceuticals sector depressed both by dollar
sentiment and a fall in SmithKline Beecham following the third-quarter
trading statement.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 showed a drop of 34.9 at 3,085.3, a few points
above the day's low. Equities were on the slide from the opening, but the
losses in the blue chips were extended sharply when reports from Japan -
quickly denied - suggested that US monetary policy would hold steady until
the year-end, implying no further increase in key rates by the Federal
Reserve.
In spite of the denials of the Tokyo reports, global markets remained
cautious towards near-term prospects for the US currency.
The Dow Average, also reacting to trading results from leading names in the
US banking and manufacturing industries, showed a fall of 12 points when
London closed.
The UK equity market started the day a shade easier and then quickly fell
away as both gilt-edged stocks and stock index futures gave ground. The
latest Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures and then the announcement
that next week's bond auction would be Pounds 2.5bn of 2000 stock left gilts
easier at the close.
The trading statement from SmithKline Beecham would have gone down well but
for the disclosure that sales of Tagamet, its high selling anti-ulcer drug,
had fallen heavily after expiry of the US patent.
Patent expiry is a background worry for all pharmaceutical manufacturers and
the implications of Tagamet's fortunes were not lost on Glaxo and other drug
firms, which were already unhappy because of the worries over the dollar.
Falls in these blue chip internationals affect the Footsie index
significantly.
Activity in the big dollar-earning stocks helped to boost the day's Seaq
volume total by nearly 15 per cent to 527.8m shares, but this was still a
poor total by this year's daily averages. Traders confessed to an
uninspiring session, with the stock market driven from the futures pits.
Business in second line or non-Footsie stocks made up about 64 per cent of
the day's total, a higher proportion than seen recently. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index finished 15.7 off at 3,532.3.
Retail and consumer stocks chose to pay more heed to the market's fears of a
base rate increase than to the CBI's indication that September's retail
sales had risen at the highest rate for nearly a year. Most of the big
retailer stocks were down at the close, albeit following modest turnover.
The stock market's mood of uncertainty was highlighted in the latest
Economic and Monetary Review from Credit Lyonnais Securities. The review
predicted that the cyclical growth peak may have already passed, with
consumer spending in particular likely to remain disappointing; Credit
Lyonnais sees the UK economy as likely to grow by only 2.5 per cent next
year.
But the firm remains confident that UK equities 'now offer fair value' and
looks for 10 per cent upside by the end of the year, echoing many other
forecasts from market analysts that the final quarter will see shares
benefit from the increasing pace of economic recovery.

FT  19 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved lower on improved turnover, but traders continued
to describe the market as oscillating with little real idea of direction,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract fell to 3,090 in the last hour of trading
but had clawed back to 3,100 at the 4.10pm official close, down 40 on the
day. At this level the premium to the cash market was 17 points, with the
fair value premium around 13 points.
Trading volume was healthier than on Monday, increasing to 13,429 contracts
from 11,811 in the previous session.
Although there were occasional flashes of institutional activity, the
quality of business remained low and the December contract seldom met with
any real weight of selling.
Traders said the recent glimmer of institutional interest was encouraging.
The current, final quarter of the year is traditionally an active one for
institutions, they said. 'What this market badly needs is a genuine
improvement in the quality of business,' one commented.
Stock options business also improved, rising to 26,685 contracts from
Monday's 22,778. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 18,136 lots.
Among individual options, Guinness was the most active at 1,322 lots dealt,
followed by J. Sainsbury (1,017 lots) and Glaxo (837).

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil improves 2.6%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Sao Paulo finished 2.6 per cent ahead after moderate trade,
boosted by a new influx of foreign money into the market as bargain hunting
took place. The Bovespa index improved 1,252 to 49,096, but in spite of the
rally, stocks were still down 10.5 per cent over the month to date. Volume
was RDollars 313.4m (Dollars 370.4m).
Analysts said the end of a struggle between shorts and longs seen prior to
the futures settlements on October 13 and 17 eased the downward pressure on
prices. But they remained concerned about the impact of rising inflation on
the government's anti-inflation plan. The market upward revised its October
inflation forecasts to around 3.0 per cent after 0.8 per cent inflation in
September. It was feared that the government would lift interest rates in
the short term in an effort to contain a recent consumer surge in spending
and hold prices down.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Strength in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg strengthened again yesterday as demand was reawakened.
Dealers said the gold price, recent blue chip strength on Wall Street, the
expectation of continued strong local company earnings, and a limited supply
of quality stock were all factors behind the gains, which were expected to
be extended in the short term.
But traders added that firmness in the financial rand had depressed some
major shares.
The overall index climbed 27 to 5,682, industrials 65 to 6,468 and golds 22
to 2,322.
Sappi set another high for the year as it gained R1 at R66 on continued
positive reaction to its acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren,
and ahead of interim results. De Beers finished R1.85 down at R99.75 on
foreign selling.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rise in oil prices sends Dow
lower
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
Declines in government bond prices amid fresh concern about prospects for
higher interest rates set the tone for a subdued session on US stock markets
yesterday, with share prices ending with an easier tendency after lacklustre
trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.39 at 3,917.54, but was well off its
low for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed 1.30
down at 467.66, while the American SE composite dipped 2.04 to 456.72 and
the Nasdaq composite softened 0.97 to 764.81. Trading volume on the New York
SE was 260m shares.
After putting together a string of impressive gains over the past few
trading days, analysts were expecting to see a pull-back in blue chip stocks
some time this week. It came yesterday morning as falling bond prices gave
investors an excuse to sell, or keep out of the market altogether.
Bonds fell because of a rise in oil prices, which always rattles
inflation-sensitive fixed-income investors, and because of a statement from
Ms Susan Phillips, a Federal Reserve governor, that the US economy was
'surprisingly' strong. The comment suggested that the economy is still
growing at a rate faster than the Fed expected, and led the bond market to
conclude that another interest rate increase to slow economic growth would
be announced by the Fed soon.
The concerns were shared by stock market investors, who are equally troubled
by the thought of another monetary policy tightening. There have been five
interest rate increases already this year, and the markets fear that further
rises could undermine not just economic growth, but also corporate earnings
growth in the coming quarters.
For now, however, companies continue to post impressive quarterly earnings.
Yesterday, among stocks benefiting from better than expected profits were
Merrill Lynch, up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 35 1/4 , Sun Microsystems, Dollars
1 7/8 higher at Dollars 32 1/4 , Citicorp, Dollars 1 1/4 ahead at Dollars 44
1/8 , and Apple Computer, Dollars 1 1/2 firmer at Dollars 41 1/4 .
Philip Morris's earnings also exceeded analysts' expectations, although not
by much, and the 27 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 1.2bn failed to
excite investors, who bid the company's stock down Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 61
1/2 in busy trading.
Another stock that fell in spite of a strong third quarter was Sprint, which
dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 even though the long-distance
telephone group's earnings of 66 cents a share beat the consensus forecast
of 63 cents.
Polaroid shed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after announcing third-quarter
earnings of 62 cents a share, up from 52 cents a year ago but well below
most Wall Street forecasts.
Drugs stocks were mixed. Merck, following modestly disappointing results,
slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 35 5/8 . Pfizer rallied from early weakness
to finish Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 72.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Extended dollar weakness hits
bonds, equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Monday's weakness, when Mr Helmut Kohl's German election victory and
the strength of the D-Mark helped to push the dollar to a two-year low, the
US currency was looking shaky again yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
European bond markets lost ground, some more than others; the effect on
equities was similarly varied, but generally depressing.
FRANKFURT weakened slightly in official floor trading, the Dax index easing
6.12 to 2,084.76, and took a more serious tumble in the post-bourse where
the Ibis-indicated Dax closed 26.00 lower at 2,069.58. Turnover fell from
DM8.5bn to DM6.3bn.
Once again, the weakness of the dollar made its most serious impact on the
big cyclical exporters, and carmakers in particular as Volkswagen denied
rumours that it had lost money in foreign exchange markets. By the end of
the post-bourse, BMW was down DM19 over 24 hours, Daimler by DM15.20 and VW
by DM16.70, to DM786, DM764.50 and DM447 respectively.
However, carmakers also took the lead in Germany's pre-election rally:
before that, on October 7, these three were priced at DM745, DM730 and
DM438; there were suggestions during the session that investors were
switching out of the sector, and into banks and utilities.
The post-bourse blew more froth off some other stocks: Continental, the
tyremaker, lost DM8.50 at DM225; the vulnerable Metallgesellschaft DM8.90 at
DM159.10; Schering, and its drug prospects, fell DM34 to DM964; Mannesmann,
and its mobile telephones story, by DM16.50 to DM389; and, circling back to
dollar-influenced, cyclical recovery prospects, Deutsche Babcock by DM7 to
DM230.
PARIS drifted lower in a session that failed to come alive. The CAC-40 index
ended off 7.82 at 1,898.60, after moving in a narrow range between 1,912 and
1,892.
The forthcoming Renault part-privatisation remained at the forefront of
investors' minds, although the vehicle sector was yesterday pulled in
different directions: Peugeot down FFr13 at FFr769 and Valeo up FFr3 at
FFr283.10.
Hoare Govett said recently that it had a preference for the carmakers over
the equipment makers, and rated Valeo a sell, in spite of having upgraded
1994 and 1995 earnings forecasts for the company. 'An acquisition (by Valeo)
remains a distinct probability, possibly in the automotive electronics
sector, where Valeo has no real experience: a development which would weigh
on short-term profitability,' said the broker.
MILAN was lower, with investors unnerved by news that the government was
prepared to reopen budget negotiations over pensions cuts with the unions,
and the Comit index lost 10.72 or 1.7 per cent to 626.66.
Robert Fleming Securities commented that the Italian market had
underperformed Europe by approximately 4 per cent, or 8.9 per cent in dollar
terms, during the last quarter, eroding outperformance since the beginning
of the year to 14.5 per cent, or 10.2 per cent in dollar terms. 'Continued
sales from foreign institutions have compounded the effect of the sales by
domestic private investors, scared off by persistently high rates and the
inherent instability of the government.' Industrials led the market lower,
with Fiat L110 or 1.7 per cent down at L6,200 and Montedison losing L20 or
1.6 per cent at L1,201.
Pirelli fell L33 or 1.5 per cent to L2,216 after exceptionally heavy trading
was reported on Seaq International in London on Monday, with 57m shares, or
almost 4 per cent of the company's capital, changing hands. The London
volume puzzled one analyst who noted that only 6.5m shares changed hands in
Milan on Monday. He added that there was no fundamental reason for the
stock's weakness.
A L61 or 8.6 per cent rise to L771 in Gaic was prompted by comments by the
Ferruzzi Finanziaria chairman Mr Guido Rossi that Ferruzzi was considering a
full bid. Ferruzzi fell L44 to L1,322.
ZURICH saw industrials marked lower because of the weak dollar before the
malaise spread over to the banks and insurers. The SMI index gave up 33.1 or
1.3 per cent to 2,542.5.
Roche certificates fell SFr155 or 2.6 per cent to SFr5,680 as Credit Suisse
downgraded the stock and trimmed its earnings forecasts, following Monday's
nine-month sales figures. Goldman Sachs, which had already taken the
certificates off its buy list, also reduced its 1994 earnings forecast to
reflect the pharmaceuticals group's restructuring costs.
UBS slipped SFr15 to SFr1,275 ahead of today's press conference at which,
the board has said, it wants to answer various issues surrounding its battle
for influence with BK Vision.
AMSTERDAM was weaker, with the AEX index settlng down 2.94 at 405.50.
Nedlloyd, the transport group, was among the day's steepest losers, off Fl
2.90 at Fl 55.00, as Goldman Sachs in London lowered its 1994 profits
estimate by 30 per cent to Fl 90m.
Mr Pierre Stiennon, an analyst at Goldman, commented that while the group
had achieved savings in cutting its internal costs, its main external
sectors - ocean shipping, European road transport and the Neddrill drilling
subsidiary - were under pressure.
However, Goldman was maintaining its hold recommendation ahead of the
company's third-quarter results due on November 30.
MADRID's domestic bond market reacted forcibly after a September budget
deficit, and a December inflation forecast of 4.3 to 4.6 per cent; equities
took in these, and the arrest in Barcelona of the financier Mr Javier de la
Rosa, and the general index dropped 4.62 or 1.5 per cent to 296.69.
Mr Jerry Evans, European equity strategist at Klenwort Benson, noted that in
addition to the macro influences, this was a market where banks and
utilities, both vulnerable to falls in bond values, accounted for nearly
three-quarters of the market's equity capitalisation. Banks, utilities and
construction stocks were all weak yesterday, with BCH down Pta75 at
Pta3,035, and Endesa off Pta140 at Pta5,570.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ahead as Seoul
continues record-setting rally
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Small-lot buying by dealers and overseas investors supported share prices
and the Nikkei 225 average ended higher for the first time in three days,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index was finally ahead 34.11 at 19,992.40 after a day's peak of
20,020.60 and low of 19,946.99. Prices moved within a narrow range with most
investors still cautious over the yen's fluctuations.
Volume came to 255m shares, against 200m. Activity remained low due to the
rise of the yen. The Topix index of all first section stocks was just 0.19
firmer at 1,586.65 and the Nikkei 300 inched up 0.20 to 290.09. Declines led
advances by 496 to 449, with 206 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei
50 index put on 1.71 at 1,301.00.
Traders said some individuals moved to trade in the second section and in
the over-the-counter market. Second section and OTC companies were expected
to enjoy larger increases in earnings than large first section corporations.
According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper, pre-tax profits for OTC
companies are expected to rise 32 per cent in the current business year.
Overseas investors traded in shipping companies. Some analysts were bullish
about an historically low level of world surplus shipping capacity - 2.2 per
cent of supply for last year. 'We expect this to translate into
significantly higher charter rates for most ship types,' said Ms Kathy
Matsui, a strategist at Goldman Sachs. Kawasaki Kisen, the most active issue
of the day, finished Y7 down at Y409 after hitting the year's high of Y422.
Although higher gold prices helped mining and non-ferrous metal issues,
profit-taking finally eroded the day's gains. Sumitomo Metal Mining was off
Y15 at Y980 after touching a year's high of Y1,010.
The yen's strength prompted small-lot selling of high-technology stocks by
foreign investors. Toshiba dipped Y10 to Y753, Matsushita Electric
Industrial Y10 to Y1,660 and Sony Y70 to Y5,880.
Reports of lower than expected profits depressed Honda Motor by Y40 to
Y1,730. Isuzu Motors rose Y16 to Y528 on hopes of strong earnings, while
other car makers were also firm, with Nissan Motor up Y7 to Y825 and Toyota
Motor gaining Y10 at Y2,070.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 16.47 to 22,326.31 in volume of 26.7m shares.
Roundup
Sentiment in the region stayed mixed. Sri Lanka was closed for a holiday.
SEOUL finished at another record high, but profit-taking eroded a sharp
early rally that was prompted by the settlement of the US-North Korean
talks. The composite index gained only 3.42 at 1,113.29 after posting an
intraday all-time peak of 1,127.09.
Construction and trading shares were among the day's beneficiaries on hopes
that they would be major gainers when relations with North Korea improve.
The sub-index for the construction industry advanced 13.12 or 2.3 per cent
to 595.71.
HONG KONG ended a sluggish session lower as investor confidence continued to
be eroded by the weakness of the dollar, nagging talk about the health of
Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, and tomorrow's local land auction.
The Hang Seng index slipped 37.37 to 9,418.57 in preliminary turnover of a
low HKDollars 2.38bn.
The China incorporated H-shares index fell 27.62 or 2.1 per cent to
1,316.94, having lost almost 45 points on Monday.
SINGAPORE eased, with retail sentiment dampened by talk of forced selling in
Malaysian stocks traded over the counter. The Straits Times Industrial index
closed 3.59 down at 2,383.98.
Sentiment over Malaysian stocks was also weakened by Malaysia's finance
minister Mr Anwar Ibrahim, who told Malaysians not to expect too much from
the October 28 budget statement.
KUALA LUMPUR again reversed an early firm trend to close lower, pressured by
forced selling in the afternoon. The composite index lost 7.38 at 1,118.74,
having touched an early high of 1,128.47, but trading was slow, volume of
245m shares falling below Monday's 307m.
MANILA took its rally into a fifth day after San Miguel Corp reported a 40
per cent jump in its nine-month net. The composite index ended 42.81 up at
the day's best of 3,092.95.
Index heavyweights attracted foreign and local investors on the hope that
they will follow San Miguel's example. Volume expanded from 2.43bn shares to
3.49bn, but turnover was only slightly higher at 2.07bn pesos, against
2.01bn pesos.
SYDNEY faltered following the uneven session on Wall Street, the All
Ordinaries index closing 10.7 lower at 2,003.4 in turnover of ADollars
397.4m.
Resource issues fell by more than industrials. News Corp finished a token 2
cents higher at ADollars 8.40 as its chairman and chief executive Mr Rupert
Murdoch talked of 50 per cent profits growth over the next two to three
years at its annual meeting in Adelaide.
WELLINGTON lost its way and the NZSE-40 capital index closed at 2,052.41,
down 13.98, in turnover of NZDollars 32.9m. Trading in Telecom accounted for
one-third of overall activity, the shares receding a cent to NZDollars 5.29
in NZDollars 11.3m dealt.
TAIPEI buying centred mainly on foods, marines and steels, as the weighted
index rose 24.30 to 6,755.53 in turnover of TDollars 72.67bn.
In foods, President Enterprises and Weichuan Foods hit their daily 7 per
cent limits at TDollars 59.50 and TDollars 36.40 respectively. Marines
reflected improved prospects in coming months, with Yang Ming Marine and
U-ming Marine both limit up at TDollars 39.50 and TDollars 37.50, and steels
rose on product price rises, with Feng An Metal limit up at TDollars 66.50.
BOMBAY was lower in the absence of fresh buying support after ignoring
Monday's deregulation of interest rates by India's central bank which many
brokers said was favourable to the industry.
Computer problems prevented the calculation of the BSE 30 index, but brokers
said that given the decline in prices the index would have shown a 25 to
30-point slide from Monday's 4,365.43.
JAKARTA waited for yesterday's listing of Indosat in the US, and the JKSE
composite index eased 0.71 to 510.63.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Sterling firmer against both the dollar and
D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark lost ground on the markets yesterday as the post-election rally
in the currency faded, writes Philip Gawith.
The generalised weakness confirmed the view that the relative strength of
the D-Mark against the dollar, over the past few days, was more a case of US
currency weakness than D-Mark strength.
The D-Mark finished in London at FFr3.431, from FFr3.434. It was also lower
against the Italian lira, which closed at L1,020 from L1,023.
After an overnight low of DM1.4930, the dollar stayed above DM1.50 for most
of the day, ending at DM1.5003, from DM1.5036. Against the yen it was barely
changed at Y97.685 from Y97.85. It closed in New York at DM1.5025 and
Y97.725.
Sterling had a good day, rising against both the dollar and the D-Mark. It
finished at Dollars 1.6154, from Dollars 1.6074, and at DM2.4235 from
DM2.4168.
The phenomenon of sterling simultaneously rising against both the D-Mark and
the dollar has been fairly rare recently. Mr Chris Turner, currency
strategist at BZW, said that, during the spring, the pound moved down with
the dollar about 90 per cent of the time.
More recently, the two have moved in opposite directions around 25 per cent
of the time. In spite of yesterday's move, he said there was not yet enough
evidence to suggest that the link between the two currencies had been
broken.
On a trade weighted performance, sterling remains fairly weak. It finished
at 80, compared to a high for the year of around 83 in February. Against the
D-Mark, it also remains close to the lows for the year.
Against the dollar, however, the picture is brighter, with the pound near a
two-year high. Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global
Markets, reported 'fairly strong institutional demand against both the
dollar and the D-Mark'.
'It seems to be the case that a lot of UK corporates pre-sold sterling on
its rise above Dollars 1.55. Now there is an absence of supply and this has
encouraged buying.'
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, noted that options
volatility in sterling had risen more than in the D-Mark since the start of
the week. 'This suggests there is more of a fear of sterling, rather than
the D-Mark, rising sharply against the dollar.'
Relative short-term interest rates provide some support for sterling
strength. Three-month money in the US is currently around 5.5 per cent,
compared to 5.2 per cent in Germany and 6 per cent in the UK. Consumer
inflation, however, is around 2 per cent in the UK, compared to 3 per cent
in the US and Germany, so sterling compares even more favourably from the
point of view of real interest rates.
The dollar was fairly subdued after Monday's weakness. 'There is certainly
not the same sense of panic about the dollar that we saw yesterday,' said Mr
Loewy, although the currency did wobble at one point on rumours, later
denied, that Fed vice-chairman Mr Alan Blinder had said US interest rates
would not need to rise again this year.
The flip-side of this was a more sober attitude towards the D-Mark. After
the rush to buy D-Marks on Friday and Monday, there was some evidence
yesterday that investors had begun to take profits.
Mr Loewy said he did not think the market was expecting central bank
intervention at current levels. The speed of a currency's fall is normally
as important as the level to which it has fallen in determining central bank
activity.
The dollar had dropped nine pfennigs in 11 days - to DM1.5170 from DM1.6050
 -when, in July, it was the subject of co-ordinated central bank
intervention.
The US currency will face a renewed test today with the release of August
trade figures. A larger than expected deficit will refocus attention on the
US's trade dispute with Japan. Recent figures from Japan show its bilateral
trade surplus with the US rose in September to Dollars 5.8bn from Dollars
5.7bn.
In the futures market, short sterling paused for a breather after the recent
rally which has seen shorter-dated contracts rise 60 to 70 basis points.
Traders said the market was in a consolidation phase.
Volumes were fairly low, with the December contract trading only 22,685
contracts to close at 93.54 from 93.61. The December Euromark contract ended
unchanged at 94.82.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.207bn of
assistance after forecasting a Pounds 1.2bn shortage. Overnight money traded
between 3 and 6 1/8 per cent.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: A storm brewing in the
Caribbean - Banana exporters' fears about EU market access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caribbean banana exporters are relieved at the European Court's rejection of
a German challenge to the European Union's controversial banana import
regime, but they remain concerned about possible attacks on their
preferential access to the lucrative EU market.
The fears are based on expected challenges to the EU regime from some Latin
American producers; a better chance of success for these challenges under
new rules at the World Trade Organisation which succeeds the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade next year, and the position of influential
countries, such as the US, which oppose the regulation of trade on which the
EU's banana import regime is based.
'The ruling by the European Court is a positive sign and has brought the
Caribbean industry some relief,' says Mr Marshall Hall, chief executive of
the Producers' Group, which markets Jamaican fruit. 'But there is danger on
the horizon with Latin American producers, Germany and the United States
still trying to get the Gatt solution implemented.'
Mr Byron Blake, assistant secretary general of the Caribbean Community
(Caricom), a grouping of all Caribbean regional producers except Surinam,
agrees that there are 'some daggers still pointed at the heart of the
Caribbean's banana sector'.
One of these is a German legal challenge to an agreement reached in March
between the EU and several Latin American producers to allow tariff-free
imports of 2.1m tonnes a year of Latin fruit.
'The fact that the European Court has rejected the challenge to the import
regime would suggest that this other challenge to the EU-Latin American deal
will be treated similarly,' says Mr Blake. 'But we would be well advised not
to make any such assumptions.'
The EU's banana import regime, which was implemented 15 months ago, imposes
the quota for Latin American fruit. Suppliers from the Caribbean, Africa and
Pacific region have access to the remainder of the EU's needs of about 1.5m
tonnes per year, tariff-free.
The industry's administrators in the Windward Islands, the source of about
two thirds of the bananas imported by Britain, say they are worried about a
lobby mounted by US companies which farm bananas in Latin America to
maintain the US government's challenge of the EU banana import regime.
One St Lucian official said: 'The lobby being mounted by these large,
multinational fruit companies, which control the lion's share of the world's
banana trade, will strengthen the US resolve to attack our access to the EU
market.'
Caribbean producers feel most threatened, however, by the planned changes in
the way complaints about trade will be treated when the WTO is established.
Following complaints by Latin American producers, Gatt panels twice ruled
that the EU's import regime was unfair. However, neither ruling was adopted
as they did not have the necessary consensus among members. Under the WTO, a
similar ruling by a panel will be considered adopted unless there is
consensus among members that it should not be. Guatemala, which did not
agree to the new quotas for Latin producers, has already indicated that it
will make an early complaint to the WTO.
Caribbean banana exporters are aware that the new trade rules will force
them to compete with other producers on the same terms. The necessity to cut
production costs is accepted, but difficult to implement, according to the
industry's administrators. Small producers on the islands cannot hope to
enjoy the economies of scale of the Latin American multinationals.
'There will have to be a change in the relationship between producers,
administrators and those who market the fruit,' says Mr Blake.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU urged to reduce sugar beet
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should seize the opportunity of forthcoming reforms to of
the sugar regime to cut beet output and help competing cane producers in
developing nations, according to a London-based development agency.
The Catholic Institute for International Relations said in a report* on the
regime that the millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar the EU exported each
year depressed world prices and deprived producers in developing countries
of badly-needed foreign exchange.
It urged the EU to phase out price support for beet production that exceeds
domestic demand, compensating farmers for loss of revenue through other
payments, for example linked to environmentally-friendly farming. The
European Commission is due to unveil proposals for regime's reform in the
next few weeks.
The charity said that the Uruguay Round trade deal driving the reforms would
do little to raise world prices and help developing nations. A fall in EU
sugar exports of about 250,000 tonnes at most would be 'a drop in the ocean'
compared with its exports of 5.7m tonnes last year and would unlikely raise
world prices by more than 0.5 per cent. But cuts in EU support prices
triggered by the Gatt requirement to reduce subsidised exports would have a
disproportionate impact on former colonies which have preferential trade
agreements with the EU under the Lome convention. 'For the high-cost ACP
producers of the Caribbean, even a small price fall would have serious
consequences,' it said.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US launches investigation of EU
banana marketing regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US is the latest combatant to enter the EU banana wars, claiming
discrimination against US bananas.
'American banana marketing companies should be able to compete on a fair
basis in the European market, just as European firms can here,' says Mr
Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who has launched an
investigation of EU banana marketing practices under Section 301 of US trade
law.
Kantor is also considering an investigation of the EU 'Framework Agreement
on Bananas' reached with Costa Rica, Colombia, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The
framework accord was negotiated as a result of a complaint filed by the
Latin American producers under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
After a dispute settlement panel ruled against the EU, the Community agreed
to modify its banana import regime which gave special access to former
colonies in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific. It granted the four Latin
American countries specific quotas based on their past share of the market,
within an overall ceiling of 2.1m tonnes from Latin America.
Kantor said the framework permits the governments of Costa Rica, Colombia,
Nicaragua and Venezuela to impose 'in a discriminatory manner, export quotas
and licenses on US banana marketing and distribution companies'. In
addition, it does not address the import licensing provisions of the EU-wide
banana regime, agreed in July 1993.
Mr Kantor said he would not file a formal complaint against the framework
until it is implemented. The regime is also under threat from Germany, which
argues that it discriminates against its traditional suppliers in Latin
America. Bonn has taken two cases challenging the quota system to the
European Court. Kantor called on Latin American governments to work with the
US in seeking reform of the EU's banana policy. But he threatened an
investigation if any of the governments implements the framework pact 'or
takes alternative steps that appear to be unreasonable, unjustifiable and
discriminatory against US companies'.
Section 301 allows US companies - in this case Chiquita Brands International
and the Hawaiian Banana Industry Association - to ask the US government's
help in gaining relief from 'unfair trade practices'.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record western lead and zinc
demand forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demand for both lead and zinc in the western world will reach record levels
this year and rise again in 1995, helping to bring the markets back into
balance gradually next year.
This optimistic message comes from the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group, an intergovernmental organisation with members from 30 countries,
which has been meeting in Vienna.
It says demand for the two metals will continue to be driven by strong
growth in the US and a recovery in Europe. Zinc demand in Europe next year
is forecast to reach 2m tonnes, a level not seen since 1991. But little
change is expected in Japan.
However, the group said the outlook for lead was the more positive and added
that it recognised 'that the stocks of zinc in London Metal Exchange
warehouses currently exceed 1.2m tonnes or 10 weeks of consumption'.
Production from zinc mines is therefore expected to fall again this year -
by 2 per cent to 5.13m tonnes - after an 8 per cent drop in 1993. But zinc
mine output is then expected to rebound, by 5 per cent, in 1995 as
production is increased in Australia and Canada.
Exports, notably from China where zinc output rose substantially last year -
by 209,000 tonnes to 857,000 tonnes - will continue to plague western
markets this year, according to the group, but are expected to be below the
380,000 tonnes seen in 1993.
Zinc consumption is forecast to rise by 4 per cent to 5.76m tonnes this year
and by a further 3.6 per cent to 5.97m tonnes in 1995. Zinc metal production
is expected to be up by 1 per cent to 5.38m tonnes and by another 1.5 per
cent to 5.45m tonnes in 1995.
The group says former eastern bloc countries are providing accurate data on
their lead and zinc industries. It forecasts zinc metal output in these
countries will be about 1.61m tonnes this year and next, 'depending on
trends in the CIS', while consumption in both years will reach 960,000
tonnes.
Lead metal production in the former eastern bloc will be about 900,000
tonnes in 1994 and 1995, according to the group, while consumption will be
590,000 tonnes. In the western countries, lead consumption this year is
forecast to grow by 5 per cent to 4.72m tonnes. Lead metal output is
expected to rise by 3 per cent to 4.55m tonnes, most of which will be
recycled metal. But about 2m will come from mines. Next year consumption is
forecast to rise by 2 per cent to 4.83m tonnes, while metal production is
expected to go up by 2 per cent to 4.65m tonnes, including 2.03m tonnes from
mines.
Lead exports from eastern Europe are expected to remain 'substantial' this
year but might decrease in 1995.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee still on roller-coaster -
Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures trading continued its roller-coaster course in London and New
York yesterday as nervous traders betrayed their uncertainty about which way
the market is heading.
Robusta futures in London surged by Dollars 272 to a day's peak of Dollars
3,760 following strong gains in late trading in New York on Monday. But New
York lost its nerve yesterday, leaving the January contract in London still
up Dollars 177 on the day at Dollars 3,665 a tonne, but close to the day's
low of Dollars 3,660.
'It was purely speculative buying,' said one trader. 'The funds had gone
short and they were forced to cover on the back of the potential problems
caused by the drought in Brazil.'
The London market initially fell sharply on Monday following reports of
light rainfall in coffee-growing regions of Brazil. This was seen as
relieving the drought, which is expected to exacerbate next year's coffee
shortfall caused by two severe frosts in June and July. However, a report
from an independent US weather forecaster saying the drought was worse than
the last serious one in 1985 helped to fuel the rebound in New York and
London.
'It's a very, very nervous market,' said the trader. 'Nobody can put a firm
figure on what the crop will be.'
In afternoon trading in New York, second position arabica futures were down
5.05 cents yesterday at 203 cents a pound.
On the London Metal Exchange copper prices recovered from Monday's fall and
traders said there was still good support at Dollars 2,480 a tonne, Reuter
reports.
Three-month copper went to Dollars 2,490 before easing back to close up
Dollars 12 at Dollars 2,488.50.
A further 23,000 tonnes fall in aluminium stocks helped lift the price but
resistance held at Dollars 1,740 a tonne. Aluminium closed up Dollars 16.75
at Dollars 1,732.25.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall as focus returns to
inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices weakened at the long end of the maturity range yesterday
in the wake of higher oil prices and bearish comments from a Federal Reserve
governor.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/16 at 95
25/32 , yielding 7.862 per cent. Prices at the short end fell slightly, with
the two-year note off  1/16 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.584 per cent.
In the absence of fresh economic statistics, attention was focused primarily
on inflation fears and US monetary policy. Prices firmed slightly in early
trading amid rumours that the Fed's vice-chairman had told a Japanese
newspaper there would be no more tightening of US policy this year. The
rumours, however, proved unfounded, and prices later retreated after Ms
Susan Phillips, a Fed governor, said the US economy was growing at a
'surprising' pace.
This was bearish for the bond market, which remains fearful the Fed will
soon raise interest rates again to restrain economic growth. Investor
concerns about another rate rise have also been exacerbated by the recent
weakness in the dollar, which remained in a sickly condition.
Another factor depressing bonds was the price of oil, which climbed for the
second consecutive day amid what appeared to be a wider, general trend
toward firmer commodity prices.
European government bonds eased on profit-taking after Monday's rally, and
some traders said the markets were set for a period of consolidation.
In Germany, which led Monday's gains, the 10-year sector weakened by around
 1/4 point. The December bund futures contract on Liffe was quoted at around
90.75 in late trading, down 0.29 point on the day.
Having rallied substantially before Sunday's elections, and then continuing
their gains on Monday, bunds ran out of steam yesterday in the absence of
news or capital flows. 'Bunds have had a very good run and are in for a
period of consolidation or even a slight correction,' said a trader in
London.
However, dealers said bunds were underpinned by technical factors in the
futures market, where many see 90.50 as strong support. Moreover, dealers
hope that money supply data, expected in the next few days or early next
week, may show a further deceleration in M3 growth, lifting hopes of another
easing in monetary policy.
French bonds again did worse than their German counterparts, as investors
continued switching out of France into Germany, traders said.
The French market remains dogged by political uncertainty ahead of next
year's presidential elections. The yield spread on French 10-year bonds over
bunds widened by another two basis points to 70 basis points.
UK gilts followed the rest of Europe, with the December long gilt future
ending down  13/32 at 102.
The Bank of England announced the terms of next Wednesday's gilt auction for
Pounds 2.5bn of a new 8 per cent gilt due 2000. The terms were largely in
line with market expectations, although some dealers said they had
anticipated a slightly higher coupon.
Although sentiment has not turned negative, some observers expect the market
to consolidate in the near future. 'In the run-up to the auction the market
may come under a bit of downward pressure,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK
economist at S. G. Warburg Securities.
Shrugging off weakness in most markets, Swedish government bonds posted
small gains on a hawkish inflation report by the Riksbank. They were also
encouraged by comments from the new finance minister, Mr Goran Persson
indicating that, in addition to the SKr61bn savings plan announced before
the elections, the government aimed to undertake further fiscal tightening
in January through further spending cuts.
Dealers also welcomed the make-up of the central bank's new policy board,
which was seen likely to urge the government to maintain its course of
fiscal tightening.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe in talks on link-up
with Simex
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Liffe is exploring the potential for co-operation with the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange, as part of its strategy of seeking links
with exchanges outside the European time zone, writes Richard Lapper.
The discussions with Simex concern non-Japanese products, with an initial
focus on the euromark contract.
Simex, the third largest centre for dollar/D-Mark business in the world and
the largest in Asia, already uses the final settlement price of the Liffe
euromark contract to settle its own euromark contract.
Liffe is also in talks with the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange (Tiffe) on an arrangement to distribute a euroyen contract. It
already has a separate arrangement with the Tokyo Stock Exchange for the
Japanese government bond contract.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Cedel sets up on-line
securities order system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cedel, the international clearing and settlement organisation, is to set up
a subsidiary, called Liberty, to run an electronic on-line order routing
service for European investors seeking access to the North American markets.
Investors will be able to buy and sell securities on all the leading North
American equities exchanges, as well as on the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The product, InterTrade Direct, is designed to be compatible with most
broking work stations and internal systems.
Liberty intends to extend the system to allow European investors access to
Latin American and Pacific markets by the first quarter of 1995, and plans
an extension allowing US investors similar access to European markets.
Investors choosing the system will pay no fees, although broker-dealers who
receive the orders will pay fees to the system. Those broker-dealers may
then pass some of the costs on to investors in the form of commissions.
Investors with access to screen-based information-providers can research
prices of North American equities and electronically send buy and sell
orders to US brokers.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Steady demand for Austrian bank's
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market saw a large number of new issues yesterday in a variety
of currencies, with Osterreichische Kontrollbank's Dollars 400m offering of
five-year bonds the main attraction.
The fixed-rate bonds, which mark the Austrian bank's first foray into the
dollar sector since September 1993, were priced to yield 17 basis points
over US government bonds.
Syndicate managers said the pricing was quite tight compared with similar
eurobonds already in the market, such as the World Bank's five-year global
bond, trading at 11 basis points over, and Japan Development Bank's
eurobond, which is trading at 22 over.
Nevertheless, they found steady demand from retail investors in Switzerland
and the UK, and good institutional support, lead manager Goldman Sachs said.
One syndicate manager said: 'The deal should have come around 20 basis
points over, but nevertheless it will go well.'
Another official said: 'They chose the right part of the yield curve to
marry retail and institutional demand, although not all the bonds will be
sold at 17 over.'
The bonds are due to be freed to trade this morning, after being held in
syndicate overnight for the opening of the Japanese market.
The return of cautious optimism to government bond markets following the
German elections, and a shortage of US economic statistics this week has
boosted new eurobond issuance in recent days, syndicate officials said.
'There has been a lot of activity in the last couple of days on the back of
the elections in Germany,' said one salesman. 'We are also approaching the
year-end and many lead managers are bidding to move up the league table.'
Late in the session, Abbey National First Capital BV launched a Dollars 500m
offering of 10-year yankee bonds priced at 62.5 basis points over US
government bonds.
In the lira sector, the European Investment Bank launched a L200bn offering
of four-year bonds, with a coupon of 10.15 per cent, fungible with the
L400bn offering of bonds launched last week. Sources said the proceeds were
swapped into floating-rate lire.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank launches Baltic hedge
fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are seeking
dollar-denominated assets through a new investment fund which will buy local
bank Treasury bills and certificates of deposit.
The Baltic Cash Fund, an offshore hedge fund registered in the Cayman
Islands, has been launched by Latvia's International Bank of Riga and its
wholly-owned fund management subsidiary, Baltic Asset Management (BAML). The
two British directors of BAML are directors of Quantec, a UK-based
consulting firm specialising in active quantitative fund management
applications.
The fund, which has applied for listing on the Irish stock exchange, hopes
to raise Dollars 40m from large institutional investors with minimum
investments of Dollars 100,000 each.
It will invest primarily in short-dated bank paper with an average maturity
of 60 days from Latvia and Lithuania, and in commercial paper from Estonia.
Fund managers said rates on these instruments can be as high as 25 per cent
for US dollar-denominated bank CDs; government Treasury bills, in local
currency, can earn more than 20 per cent.
'These rates reflect the shortage of the hard currency required by the banks
for lending to local enterprises as the Baltic economies continue to develop
rapidly,' said Mr Aigar Sevels, chief executive officer of BAML. He said
Baltic entrepreneurs needed hard currency for trade with neighbouring
countries such as Russia, where the soft rouble fell by more than 30 per
cent in the first 11 days of October.

Taiwan Cement, the country's biggest cement manufacturer, has reported
pre-tax profits of TDollars 2.37bn (USDollars 90.6m) for the first nine
months of the year, down sharply from TDollars 3.36bn a year earlier, writes
Laura Tyson in Taipei. The company, controlled by the Koo family, said the
retreat was due mainly to a TDollars 700m-TDollars 800m shares sale in 1993.
Turnover also fell, to TDollars 13.44bn from TDollars 15.04bn, in part due
to a slowdown in public and private construction.
Imports of Japanese cement at 'unreasonably low' prices had pushed domestic
prices down 5 per cent since the beginning of the year, the company said.
About 90 per cent of Taiwan's cement imports come from Japan.

Bouygues of France, one of Europe's leading public works and construction
groups, expects full-year 1994 consolidated revenue to grow by 13 per cent
to FFr69.3bn (Dollars 13.4bn) from FFr61.2bn in 1993, agencies report from
Paris.
A 2 per cent increase in its construction revenues, to FFr53.1bn, will be
offset by an 18 per cent drop in revenue from real-estate operations, to
FFr3.8bn, Bouygues said.
Revenue from other operations is set to decline by 1 per cent this year, to
FFr19.7bn. However, this will be boosted in coming years by the recent
French government decision to award a third license for a cellular telephone
network to a Bouygues-led consortium.
Buoygues plans to pay an interim net dividend of FFr5 a share. Last year it
paid out a total of FFr15.

<TEXT>
Euro Disney, the France-based European theme park operator, is launching a
substantial advertising offensive, writes Andrew Jack in Paris.
It will spend three times as much over the next 12 months as it did in the
last year on television advertising in its most important markets, including
France and the UK, and will boost coverage in Germany and the Low Countries.
More money will also be spent on radio and newspapers advertising.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, said the company had decided to defend
itself against attacks on it in the run-up to a broad financial
restructuring.
He also confirmed that Euro Disney would be holding back work on its second
park, next to the existing one, until after it had met its target to become
profitable in 1996.
Parc Asterix, the Paris-based theme park competitor to EuroDisneyLand,
reported a one-third increase in the number of visitors during its 1994
season, to 1.55m.
The park, which is backed by Barclays Bank and Compagnie Generale des Eaux,
among others, said it had broken into profit this year for the first time
with FFr15m (Dollars 2.9m) following heavy start-up costs since opening in
1989.

Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company which last week acquired
US-based SD Warren, has announced much improved results for the first six
months to August, more than doubling attributable income to R144.8m (Dollars
40.5m) from R64.3m, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Turnover rose 14 per cent to R3.1bn, up from R2.75bn on the back of greatly
improved trading conditions in the pulp and paper industry. Operating income
rose 105 per cent to R207m from R101m.
The company's balance sheet remains strong, with gearing only marginally up
at 44 per cent from 41 per cent. However, this picture will change from next
year when the debt-laden SD Warren deal is included.
Sappi announced that it would change its financial year-end from February to
September from next year.

<TEXT>
Shares of Electricity Generating (Egco), which is set to become Thailand's
first partly-privatised electricity company, will be priced at between Bt17
and Bt20 for the initial public offering, valuing the company at between
Bt6.8bn (Dollars 273m) and Bt8bn, the underwriters said yesterday.
Egco, a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand (Egat), is buying a 1,200MW Egat power station in Rayong,
south-east of Bangkok; the plant accounts for 10 per cent of Thailand's
generating capacity.
After Egco shares are listed, the company has an option to buy the new 824MW
Khanom power station in southern Thailand by 1995, and is expected to
compete against private-sector rivals for independent power producer
projects that will sell electricity to Egat.
Egco's final IPO price will be set after a book-building roadshow this
month, the underwriters said, and the shares will be sold from November 7-9.
Egco has already raised Bt14.75bn in loans to pay for most of the Rayong
station.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China Resources, one of China's leading trading companies in Hong Kong, has
sold virtually all its stake in Giordano, the Hong Kong retailer controlled
by Mr Jimmy Lai who recently offended Beijing by publishing a passionate
denunciation of the Chinese Communist party.
The move by China Resources - which has reduced its 10.13 per cent interest
in Giordano to 0.35 per cent - was seen as further evidence of the disfavour
in which Giordano is held in Beijing.
The transaction took place at HKDollars 4.70 a share, and the stock was
placed with European and Asian institutions.
Mr Lai, who also publishes the highly successful Next magazine in the
colony, accused the Communist party in August of having ruined Chinese
culture.
He also launched a personal attack on Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime
minister, in part claiming that his behaviour on a visit to Germany, where
he dodged human rights activists, had humiliated the Chinese people.
Soon after the publication of the article, China's ministry of foreign
economic trade and co-operation (Moftec) withdrew permission for Giordano to
run a store in Beijing's Wangfujing Street. This was immediately followed by
Mr Lai's resignation from the chairmanship of Giordano in an attempt to
protect his company from further discrimination.
China Resources, which is owned by Moftec, was a foundation shareholder of
Giordano when it was listed in 1991. Along with the sale of its stake in the
company, Mr Wang Xin Wen, its representative on the board, resigned.
Giordano bounced back in the first six months of this year posting profits
of HKDollars 85.3m (USDollars 11m), up more than 58 per cent on the previous
corresponding period.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Experience gives ambitious TPI
an edge - Thai Petrochemical's expansion is seen as a shrewd move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone criticising Thai Petrochemical Industry for being over ambitious with
plans, announced this month, to expand in chemicals, risks receiving a sharp
reminder from the company, or from repentant stockbrokers, about TPI's
experience in the cement industry.
When TPI Polene (TPIPL), the listed TPI subsidiary, broke into the cement
oligopoly dominated by Siam Cement two years ago there was much talk of
oversupply and bad timing.
'Now they are seen to be shrewd,' admits one Bangkok broker. Demand for
cement has been strong and TPIPL has turned in handsome profits. A second
cement plant is set to double the company's capacity to 5m tonnes a year.
'It's been a success for us,' says Mr Prachai Leophairatana, the TPI chief
executive whose ethnic Chinese family controls the group. 'We have 10 per
cent of the cement market. Next year it will be 15 per cent and in three
years, 20 per cent.'
TPI's latest proposal is to invest Bt40bn (Dollars 1.6bn) during the next
few years in expanding its petrochemical complex in Rayong, south of
Bangkok. The company is already the country's biggest producer of the
plastics used in a range of consumer and industrial products from bottles to
car parts.
Planned investments include an oil refinery - Thailand's sixth, with initial
capacity of 60,000 barrels a day, rising eventually to 300,000 b/d - an
olefins plant to supply raw materials for TPI's downstream plastic
production, and several other projects designed to make TPI the country's
first integrated petrochemical producer. TPI even intends to open its own
petrol stations.
Projects already under way include a doubling of low density polyethylene
(LDPE) production to 150,000 tonnes a year, and a 108MW power station that
will provide 40MW of electricity to the petrochemicals complex and sell the
surplus to the Thai grid. Mr Prachai says both are due on stream at the end
of the year.
To help finance further expansion, the Leophairatana family plans to float
TPI on the Stock Exchange of Thailand later this year. They expect to raise
about Dollars 450m by selling 12 per cent of the company, which they say has
an annual turnover of about Dollars 1bn.
The TPI group says it was hit by low world plastic prices and barely made a
profit last year, but it anticipates a firmer market for its products -
one-third of which are exported - in the next few years.
'The timing of TPI's expansion is particularly beneficial as it coincides
with the beginning of the cyclical upturn in world plastic prices,' Mr
Prachai said recently.
Much will depend on whether TPI can bring its new capacity into operation
quick enough to take advantage of the upturn.
The planned olefins plant for ethylene and propylene feedstock will be
crucial. At present TPI buys one-fifth of its requirements locally, but has
to import the rest and pay heavily for transport to Thailand by refrigerated
tanker - which is a substantial proportion of the total cost.
'If we set up by ourselves we should save at least Dollars 150 a tonne,'
says Mr Prachai.
The transport cost of crude oil for the planned refinery, which would in
turn feed the olefins plant, would be relatively modest. The olefins plant
would produce 300,000-500,000 tonnes a year of ethylene and 160,000-250,000
tonnes of propylene.
Stockbrokers are bullish about TPIPL, which controls the cement and LDPE
interests, and admire the proven determination of Mr Prachai to bring his
schemes to fruition.
They say the flotation of the TPI parent is likely to be boosted by local
enthusiasm for oil and oil-related stocks - a new sector on the Thai stock
exchange following recent partial privatisations of several state companies,
including olefins producer National Petrochemical (NPC).
But it is doubtful that TPI and other Thai petrochemicals producers could
survive global competition without the tariff protection they enjoy in the
Thai home market.
Mr Prachai is critical of the way tariffs in the Association of South East
Asian Nations are to be reduced under the Asian Free Trade Area. He favours
protection for Thailand for the time being:
'If you want the country to flourish, you have to protect it,' he says. But
he is hostile towards Indonesian, Malaysian and Singaporean attempts to
promote their own petrochemical industries.
Mr George Morgan, of stockbrokers HG Asia in Bangkok, believes that TPI's
expansion 'does reflect the need of Thailand to move into higher value-added
industries; but the disadvantage is that they don't have oil or a large
amount of gas'.

with FFr680m in the same period of last year.
But this was almost entirely wiped out by the effect of the company's stake
in Credit Lyonnais and its obligation to assume an equivalent proportion of
the bank's FFr4.5bn first-half loss.
Thomson-CSF's turnover rose to FFr16.1bn, up 15 per cent from a year earlier
due mainly to acquisitions. Operating profits dropped slightly to FFr868m
from FFr918m, which the company said was the effect of consolidating more
activities.
At June 30, its order book represented 24 months of sales totalling
FFr65.5bn, against 20 months of sales worth FFr61.3bn at December 31 1993.
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor joint venture in which
Thomson-CSF has a stake, brought in Thomson-CSF FFr227m, or double the
amount a year earlier.
The company predicted little change in operating results for the second half
of the year, but acknowledged that its overall profit position was largely
dependent on developments at Credit Lyonnais.
However, it took consolation from the fact that as a result of this summer's
injection of capital into the bank - to which Thomson SA, the holding
company, contributed, but its electronics subsidiary did not - Thomson CSF's
stake in Credit Lyonnais has shrunk slightly to 18.9 per cent.

Archer Daniels Midland, the agribusiness concern based in Decatur, Illinois,
said its first-quarter earnings rose to Dollars 154.5m, or 45 cents a share,
up from last year's Dollars 69m, or 20 cents, when floods in the Midwest
impaired operations. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates.
With its commodity-based businesses, ADM does not report sales with its
quarterly earnings. However, analysts said that the company's two most
important business segments - corn processing and soyabean crushing - were
profiting from low raw materials prices and growing international demand for
vegetable oils and high fructose corn syrup.
Ms Bonnie Wittenburg, an agribusiness analyst for Dain Bosworth in
Minneapolis, raised her full-year earnings projection for ADM to Dollars
2.00 a share from Dollars 1.90 on the basis of the first-quarter report, and
expects the company to earn Dollars 2.40 a share next year.

Genentech, the US bio-technology company, bucked the trend of bad news from
its sector with a 116 per cent rise in net income in the third quarter to
Dollars 33.6m, or 28 cents a share. The company attributed much of the
growth to its latest product, Pulmozyne, which treats cystic fibrosis.
On Monday, shares in two smaller biotech companies, Gensia Pharmaceuticals
and ProCyte, more than halved on the news that new products had failed in
clinical trials. However, Mr Kirk Raab, chairman, said: 'Important clinical
development progress during the quarter should help us maintain our rate of
growth.'
The company said sales of Pulmozyne, in its third quarter on the market, had
been Dollars 21m compared with Dollars 18.7m in the second quarter. The drug
was launched in France and Germany in the quarter, and sells in 18
countries.
Sales of Activase, used to dissolve blood clots, were Dollars 65.1m against
Dollars 63.5m. However, sales of Genentech's two human growth hormone
products, Protropin and Nutropin, were down to Dollars 54.6m from Dollars
55.4m.
Group revenues in the quarter were Dollars 193.8m, an increase of 17 per
cent. Research and development expenditure was Dollars 73.2m, against
Dollars 72.3m, or 38 per cent of revenue.
Genentech said it did not expect government investigations into its past
marketing methods would 'materially impact' the company. The shares fell
Dollars  1/8 to close at Dollars 51 1/8.

Amgen, the California-based biotechnology company, reported strong sales
growth in its two main products in the third quarter, leading to a 23 per
cent rise in underlying earnings to Dollars 114m.
Sales of Epogen, for kidney failure, were up 25 per cent, and of Neupogen,
used to boost the immune system, by 15 per cent.
Group sales were 20 per cent ahead at Dollars 426m. Amgen said sales of
Neupogen in the US were up 11 per cent at Dollars 215m, and international
sales were up 29 per cent at Dollars 55m. Epogen sales totalled Dollars
187m. Earnings per share for the quarter were 82 cents, compared with an
adjusted 65 cents last year.
Mr Gordon Binder, chairman, said: 'I am confident that the strong patient
benefits of Epogen and Neupogen will enable us to achieve double-digit sales
and earnings growth in 1995 and that these breakthrough products, as well as
others being explored through in-house discovery and external collaboration,
will continue to fuel growth in later years.'
Amgen said that during the quarter it made a preliminary submission to the
US authorities for a new drug, neuro-trophin-3, developed in partnership
with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. The drug treats peripheral neuropathes,
found in patients undergoing cancer therapy and in diabetics.

Lotus Development reported a sharp drop in earnings for the third quarter.
The US personal computer software company said that problems in its European
operations were to blame for the reversal.
Net income before non-recurring charges was Dollars 7.3m, or 15 cents a
share, 60 per cent down on Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents, posted in the same
period last year. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.2m, a 2 per cent
decline from Dollars 240.1m in last year's third quarter.
Lotus took charges of Dollars 67.9m for the acquisition of SoftSwitch and
Edge Research, two software development groups, during the quarter. The
company also took a Dollars 9m charge for restructuring its European
operations. The net loss for the quarter, after charges, was Dollars 66.4m,
or Dollars 1.39 a share.
'Third-quarter results proved disappointing, primarily due to poor
performance of our European operations,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and
chief executive officer. He also cited slower than expected sales through a
volume purchase programme for corporate customers.
The problems in Europe stemmed from slow demand for Lotus' office PC
applications programs and a management shuffle, said Mr Edwin Gillis, chief
financial officer. During the period Lotus appointed a new manager of its
European operations.
Revenues from communications programs, used for electronic messaging, now
account for about one-third of revenues and sales of these products grew 72
per cent, year on year.
Net losses, after charges, for the year to date were Dollars 35.3m, or 76
cents a share, compared with net income after charges of Dollars 25.9m, or
59 cents, in the first nine months of 1993.
Lotus shares closed Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 34 11/16.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sun returns to its shining
performance of 1980s - Positive trends have helped the US computer company
to report record earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
We have hit a home run]' boasts Mr Scott McNealy, chairman and chief
executive of Sun Microsystems, after the computer workstation manufacturer
surprised Wall Street with record first-quarter sales and earnings.
Net income more than doubled to Dollars 38.4m, or 40 cents a share, from
Dollars 16.6m, or 16 cents, in the same period last year. Analysts had been
projecting earnings of about 26 cents a share. Revenues for the quarter were
Dollars 1.273bn, up nearly 33 per cent from Dollars 960.5m.
Sun's share price rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 yesterday.
'All of our business units met or exceeded our plans,' says Mr McNealy.
'Our desktop computer unit growth was phenomenal. Unit sales more than
doubled. Our high-end server, storage arrays and database servers did very
well.
'Our technical workstations and graphics workstations did very well . . .
You don't achieve these kind of numbers because one product line or one
geographic area did well. You have to hit the lot.'
First-quarter shipments of workstations and servers jumped nearly 50 per
cent from a year ago to 74,000 systems in the quarter, the company said.
Shipments would have been higher but for a shortage of D-Ram (dynamic random
access memory) chips during the quarter, says Mr McNealy.
'Our backlog is still higher than we would like.'
With memory chip shortages easing, Sun expects to reduce its order backlog
in the current quarter.
Orders booked during the first quarter were Dollars 1.27bn, up 33 per cent
from Dollars 942.1m a year earlier.
For Sun, the first-quarter results represent a return to the shining
performance of previous years.
After breaking business growth records in the 1980s, its performance dimmed
as growth in the market for computer workstations slowed and competitors,
offering more powerful workstations, bit into Sun's market.
Sun still holds a commanding lead in the Dollars 10bn workstation market for
powerful desktop computers used by engineers, designers and financial
analysts.
The company, however, is increasingly turning to the broader market for
'enterprise' computing based on networks of desktop computers and servers.
'We want to be known as the world's best supplier of network computing
products,' says Mr McNealy.
The trend towards computer networking - on a local, company and global scale
 -presents big opportunities for Sun, he says, as many businesses move from
mainframes to cheaper, more flexible networks of smaller machines.
At the same time, departments and branch offices are 'upsizing' PC networks
by adding powerful 'servers'. Sun is the 'rightsizing' computer supplier,
says Mr McNealy.
Sun's Solaris software, a version of Unix, is gaining momentum in the
networking market after a rocky start.
SunSoft, the company's system software unit, distributed 82,000 Solaris
licences during the first quarter, the company said. A version of Solaris
designed to run on Intel-based servers is now 'up and running', says Mr
McNealy. 'Novell, the leading network software supplier, is vulnerable to
competition, he adds.
'Novell is a soft underbelly and everybody is going after their market. We
see a real opportunity to do well there.'
Another positive trend for Sun is the growth of global networking. 'The
Internet is growing like crazy and 56 per cent of the servers on the
Internet are from Sun. As the Internet grows, we grow,' says Mr McNealy.
He is more cautious, however, about consumer use of high-speed networks. 'A
lot of money will be lost on the information highway over the next few
years. We'd just rather not lose (money) there.'
Sun is also moving to upgrade the performance of its workstations with a new
microprocessor chip, called UltraSparc. First samples of the new chip have
just arrived. 'You will see faster workstations and servers based on
UltraSparc in about a year,' says Mr McNealy.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poor conditions hit Wall Street
securities firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns yesterday provided further evidence of how
the deterioration in trading and underwriting conditions on Wall Street has
hit securities firms' earnings.
Both companies announced sharply lower profits for the latest quarter.
At Merrill, the securities industry leader, net income during its third
quarter tumbled 36 per cent to Dollars 232m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, while
net revenues dropped 13 per cent to Dollars 2.3bn.
As in previous quarters, the biggest decline at Merrill was recorded in
investment banking revenues, which fell 46 per cent to Dollars 245m.
Higher interest rates have led to a dramatic downturn in the underwriting
business, with the rising cost of credit deterring domestic and
international companies from raising capital on the US debt and equity
markets.
The firm's trading business has also suffered, with revenues from principal
transactions falling 12 per cent to Dollars 654m.
Surprisingly, however, Merrill said its earnings from trading fixed-income
securities were about the same as a year ago, which indicates that the firm
is surviving the slump in worldwide bond markets better than most.
Brokerage commission revenues held up reasonably well, slipping 3 per cent
to Dollars 674m in the quarter, but the flattening of the yield curve
prompted a 19 per cent decline in net interest profit to Dollars 211m.
On a more positive note, Merrill's asset management and portfolio service
fees climbed 9 per cent to Dollars 431m, as client assets under fee-based
management rose 8 per cent to Dollars 167bn by the end of September.
With much of its employees' compensation tied to performance, the decline in
Merrill's overall earnings at least led to lower expenses during the
quarter. Non-interest expenses fell 4 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn, with the
compensation and benefits category dropping 9 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
The earnings picture at Bear Stearns was bleaker, primarily because the firm
lacks Merrill's more diversified revenue base.
Net income during its fiscal first quarter fell to just Dollars 35.5m, or 25
cents a share, from Dollars 104.3m a year ago. Although revenues from
commissions, interest and dividends rose during the period, those gains
could not offset big declines elsewhere.
Investment banking revenues fell by more than half in the quarter, to
Dollars 58.4m from Dollars 119m a year ago. Commission revenues, however,
climbed 12 per cent to Dollars 120.3m, while interest and dividends produced
revenues of Dollars 447.5m, up sharply from Dollars 247m a year ago.
There was a positive reaction from the stock market. Shares in Merrill Lynch
climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 , while Bear Stearns rose Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 15 5/8.

Travelers, the broad-based US financial services group, was held back by
difficult conditions in the financial markets in the three months to the end
of September.
The company reported a marginal advance in earn-ings per share to 97 cents,
up from 96 cents a year before.
Profit growth was dampened by a fall in operating earnings at Smith Barney,
the group's securities business.
Smith Barney reported earnings of Dollars 72.9m, down from Dollars 118.8m,
even though the year-ago period included only a two-month contribution from
Shearson, the retail broker Travelers bought from American Express.
Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive, said the stability of the
group's consumer lending and life assurance businesses had enabled it to
withstand the difficult conditions in the brokerage business.
Earnings from consumer finance rose 10 per cent to Dollars 56m, while
operating profits from life assurance were 13 per cent higher, at Dollars
50m.
Overall, Travelers reported net income for the period of Dollars 331m,
compared with Dollars 242m the year before.
In the 1993 period, the group, then known as Primerica, had yet to buy out
the whole of the Travelers insurance company.

<TEXT>
Apple Computer has turned in record fourth-quarter revenues, boosted by
strong sales of multimedia personal computers and its new Power Macintosh
models. Earnings picked up significantly as costs declined.
Revenues totalled Dollars 2.4bn, a 16 per cent increase over last year's
fourth quarter, and the highest quarterly figure in Apple's history. Net
income for the three months was Dollars 114.7m, or 95 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents, a year ago.
Apple said quarterly unit shipments exceeded 1m computers for only the
second time in its history.
Mr Michael Spindler, president and chief executive officer, attributed the
increase to strong demand for multimedia versions of its Macintosh
computers, notebook computers and its new Power Macintosh desktop computers.
Strong demand has led to a shortage of some of these products, Apple said.
During the quarter the company shipped more than 250,000 Power Macintosh
personal computers and upgrades, bringing the total to more than 600,000
units since the products were introduced in March.
The company has set a goal of shipping 1m Power Macintosh personal computers
and upgrades in the first 12 months.
Apple said its earnings improvement was the result of strong revenue growth
combined with higher gross margins and lower operating expenses. Gross
margins improved to 27.2 per cent of net sales, compared with 25.7 per cent
in the fourth quarter of 1993.
Operating expenses declined to 19.6 per cent of sales, from 25.4 per cent,
and represented one of the lowest operating expense ratios in Apple's
history.
For the full year revenues were Dollars 9.19bn, a 15 per cent increase over
fiscal 1993, while net income jumped to Dollars 310.2m, or Dollars 2.61,
against Dollars 86.6m, or 73 cents.
Included in the company's results for fiscal 1993 was a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 320.9m for restructuring and other expenses.
Fiscal 1994 results include a pre-tax gain of Dollars 126.9m related to a
reduction in the company's estimates of restructuring costs.

<TEXT>
Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, reported record sales
and earnings for the third quarter, with revenues up sharply as sales of its
high-performance Pentium microprocessors, used in the latest personal
computers, doubled.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.86bn, up from Dollars 2.24bn a year
ago. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 659m, or Dollars 1.52 a share,
against Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33, for the same quarter last year.
'The PC industry is rapidly moving to a new performance standard, based on
Pentium microprocessors,' said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief
executive. 'The PC industry is moulting, shedding its past in a way that
hasn't happened for a decade. Just one year ago, the standard was a PC
featuring an Intel 486 microprocessor. Today, a PC at the same price point
has a Pentium processor.'
Intel said it expected to meet its goal of increasing Pentium sales to 25
per cent of its fourth-quarter microprocessor unit sales.
A second goal was to ship 6m-7m Pentium chips this year. The company said it
expected to be within a few weeks of meeting this goal by the end of the
year.
Although Intel dominates the market for microprocessors used in PCs, with
about 90 per cent of the world market, there are strong competitors.
Advanced Micro Devices is expected this week to announce a new chip called
the 'K86', which it says will be compatible with Intel's Pentium, but
faster. IBM, Nexgen and Cyrix are also offering their own versions of
Intel-compatible microprocessors.
The threat of a new PC standard that could undermine Intel's domination of
the market appears, however, to be receding. Efforts by IBM, Motorola and
Apple to establish their jointly-developed 'PowerPC' microprocessor as an
alternative standard for PCs have so far had little impact, largely because
there is limited software available for PCs built with the new
microprocessor.
Intel's nine-month revenues were Dollars 8.29bn, up 30 per cent from Dollars
6.39bn. Net income was Dollars 1.92bn, up 13 per cent from Dollars 1.7bn for
the first three quarters of 1993. Earnings per share grew to Dollars 4.37
from Dollars 3.86.

Corning, the diversified US manufacturer, pushed up net earnings by 24 per

cents a share, writes Our New York Staff.
Earnings were hit, however, by a net Dollars 55.4m charge related to the

Sales in the quarter were up 20 per cent to Dollars 1.4bn, half the rise
being due to the acquisitions. Net income from associates rose 35 per cent
to Dollars 42.4m, mainly because of loss elimination after the sale last
year of Vitro Corning, a Mexican venture.

<TEXT>
Television Broadcasts (TVB), a Hong Kong broadcaster, is poised to compete
with Star TV, News Corporation's Asian satellite television arm, following
government approval enabling the domestic company to establish a pan-Asian
satellite service.
The colony's broadcasting authority gave the local station permission to
broadcast regionally, but not in Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong and
southern China.
TVB has no immediate plans to capitalise on its new freedom. It will instead
concentrate on the Taiwan market and broadcasting encrypted signals which
are decoded by local cable operators.
Mr Alfred Ng, assistant general manager and company secretary, said: 'We
believe our current strategy of selling decoders to cable head-ends,
allowing them to distribute our signals, is correct.'
It is a policy which appears to have paid off: TVB is among the colony's
most profitable media companies, last year turning in a 42 per cent jump in
net earnings to HKDollars 519.6m (USDollars 67.3m).
Securing permission to broadcast regionally paves the way for TVB's main
aim: to be granted a satellite uplink and downlink licence allowing it to
bring signals directly to satellite.
It currently employs Hongkong Telecom to carry signals and beam them up.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris recovery continues
with 27% rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group, continued its bounce-back from
last year's depressed figures with a 27 per cent surge in net profits to
Dollars 1.2bn in its third quarter.
In April last year Philip Morris cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes and
its other premium brands in the US to win back market share from low-cost
rivals. This led to a series of adverse quarterly earnings comparisons which
only began to abate in the second quarter of this year.
The biggest single component of the profits growth reported yesterday was
the recovery in Philip Morris's domestic tobacco operations. Operating
income from this division shot up by 40 per cent to Dollars 863m because
volumes rose in response to the company's increased market share.
The company also saw profit increases in its other food and tobacco
divisions. International tobacco increased operating income by 18 per cent
to Dollars 800m, international food was up 12 per cent at Dollars 269m,
North American food up 6 per cent at Dollars 618m, and Miller Brewing up 18
per cent at Dollars 111m.
Overall, group revenues rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Earnings per
share advanced 28 per cent to Dollars 1.42, a touch above the Dollars 1.40
expected by analysts, but the shares eased back Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 61
1/2 in a falling market.
Philip Morris said it sold 201bn cigarettes world-wide during the quarter,
up 16 per cent from the comparable quarter's figure.
Outside the US, the volume of cigarettes sold rose by 19 per cent to 144bn,
with growth in most markets except Turkey, where sales were affected by poor
economic conditions.
In the US, Philip Morris said profits from tobacco had been boosted by the
fact that a greater portion of the volume mix came from premium brands. It
quoted figures suggesting that Marlboro's market share had risen to a record
29.1 per cent in August, 7 percentage points higher than the period just
before last year's price cuts.
Mr William Murray, chairman, said he was confident the company would be able
to sustain its strong momentum.

Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company, claimed an
'outstanding' third quarter with net income up 29 per cent to Dollars 230m,
or 66 cents a share.
The fastest growth came in cellular operations, where operating profits were
almost tripled at Dollars 32m. This was almost 30 per cent more than the
division made in the whole of 1993, Sprint said.
Profits from long-distance calls were up 31 per cent at Dollars 165m, with
intense competition in the consumer market offset by growth in business
services. The long-distance division had made record sales and operating
profits for nine quarters in a row, Sprint said.
In local calls, sales rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.11bn, with the number of
local access lines installed up nearly 5 per cent. However, operating profit
was ahead only 1 per cent as a result of lower call charges. 'In the fourth
quarter, we will continue to adjust prices to position ourselves more
competitively in the market-place,' Sprint said.
The number of Sprint's cellular customers grew 64 per cent year-on-year to
882,000. This was the eighth successive quarter in which numbers had grown
by more than 50 per cent, Sprint said.
Group sales rose 13 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 3.23bn. Interest
payable fell 14 per cent to Dollars 99m, and operating cash flow was Dollars
837m.
Sprint said it was confident its planned Dollars 1.9bn capital investment
programme could be carried out without recourse to external finance.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Merck and Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals companies, each reported
underlying double-digit sales growth for the three months to the end of
September, in spite of pressure on drug prices in the US and around the
world.
At Merck, sales of human and animal health products grew by 11 per cent.
This was in spite of the effect of lower prices, mainly in non-US markets,
which shaved two percentage points off sales growth.
As with Lilly, foreign exchange differences added one percentage point to
sales growth in the period.
Merck's overall sales of Dollars 3.8bn were up from Dollars 2.5bn a year
ago, due to its acquisition of Medco Containment Services, the pharmacy
benefit management company, at the end of last year.
Medco's lower profit margins mean that net income from a year ago was up
only 11 per cent, at Dollars 785m, while earnings per share were flat at 62
cents.
Merck did not provide a detailed break-down of sales of its various drugs,
but said the advance had been led by a range of its newer products.
Eli Lilly, meanwhile, reported a 25 per cent jump in pharmaceutical sales
compared with a year before, primarily due to the success of Prozac, its
market-leading anti-depressant.
The high sales of Prozac were based in part on a build-up in inventories by
wholesalers before a price rise, Lilly said.
The company is currently locked in discussions with US regulators over its
own planned acquisition of a pharmacy benefit management company, PCS.
Overall sales growth in the US came in spite of pressure on prices from
managed-card organisations and higher rebates manufacturers are being forced
to pass on to Medicaid, the government-run healthcare scheme for the poor,
Lilly said.
Net income reached Dollars 318m on sales of Dollars 1.82bn, compared with
Dollars 294.4m on sales of Dollars 1.53bn a year before. Earnings per share
were Dollars 1.10, up from Dollars 1.00.

groups
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico has given preliminary approval to almost all the international banks,
brokerages and insurance companies that applied earlier this year to open up
subsidiaries.
The finance ministry announced on Monday night that 18 of 20 banks seeking
authorisation will be given licences, 16 of 17 brokerages, and 12 of 13
insurance companies. No decisions were announced for applications for
factory companies, exchange houses, non-bank banks, and investment funds.
Approval for one leasing company was given, although 12 originally applied.
The government expected the new institutions to invest about Dollars 1.2bn
after final authorisation. The finance ministry said foreign banks' capital
will initially account for 6.25 per cent of domestic banking capital,
against the 8 per cent limit set for 1994 under the North American Free
Trade Agreement. Brokerages will take up the maximum 10 per cent limit, with
individual capital requests of applicants scaled back.
Under the trade agreement, limits on foreign capital in the banking and
brokerage sector are gradually increased until finally scrapped at the end
of the decade. Non-US and Canadian banks applied for licences from their
North American subsidiaries.
The two institutions that were either denied or dropped their request were
the International Bank of Commerce and Morgan Stanley (which received a
licence to open a brokerage).
With some institutions - such as Citibank, J. P. Morgan, Chemical bank  -
making applications for banks and brokerages, the total number of foreign
institutions that are to receive authorisations reached 40.
With the exception of Citibank, the banks that received preliminary
authorisation are expected to concentrate on corporate lending, leaving the
retail market to Mexican counterparts.

gold division
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The gold division of South African mining house Johannesburg Consolidated
Investments, which is due to be spun off to black investors early next year,
has reported a sharp drop in profits for the September quarter.
Although ore production rose 5 per cent to 2.7m tonnes from 2.55m tonnes in
June, a lower average yield meant overall gold revenue increased by only 3.5
per cent to R557.9m (Dollars 157.6m) from R539.1m.
Group profits fell 36.6 per cent to R98m from R154m, as all the group's
mines reported poorer after-tax profits.
However, this was blamed largely on accounting changes to the previous
quarter's results, most notably the restatement of figures to reflect a
successful insurance claim at Western Areas.
As a result, Western Areas showed the most dramatic fall in after-tax
profit, of 51.7 per cent to R36.5m from R75.46m. Randfontein was down 21.8
per cent to R60.2m from R76.9m.
Struggling HJ Joel fell 37.7 per cent, with after-tax profits down to R1.41m
from R2.27m, in spite of a shift to a seven-day working week.
However, Mr Kennedy Maxwell, gold division chairman, said the results were
satisfactory in the prevailing climate. He was optimistic that the gold
price would remain in its current trading range of Dollars 370-Dollars 400,
which would benefit the group.
Randgold and Exploration, the troubled mining group subject to a management
takeover by a consortium led by British merchant bank SG Warburg in August,
has continued its downward slide, as two of its four mines reported a loss
for the September quarter.
Overall, the group's net attributable profit dropped sharply to just R4.3m
from R30.8m the previous quarter. This was in spite of an improved gold
price.
Only Harmony, which reported profits after capital expenditure of R8.63m, up
from R7.5m in June, showed improvement.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: US banks battle to maintain pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The headline on a recent report from Paine-Webber banking analyst Mr
Lawrence Cohn said it all: 'This is about as good as it gets.'
With bad-debt charges lower than at any time for years and lending margins
still only slightly below their cyclical peaks, US commercial banks' profits
are surging. But the concern for share prices in the sector is that it is
difficult to see how the momentum can be maintained.
Each of the three biggest New York-based banks - Citicorp, Chemical and
Chase Manhattan - comfortably exceeded market expectations with
third-quarter earnings reported yesterday.
While Citicorp's 22 per cent return on capital in the period made it the
star of the pack, both Chemical and Chase beat earnings per share forecasts
by more than 15 per cent.
Among other banks reporting yesterday, net earnings at Wells Fargo jumped 32
per cent on a sharply lower provisions for bad debts, while BancOne's
earnings fell due to its sensitivity to rising US interest rates.
Chemical's revenues were unchanged from a year before, at Dollars 2.16bn,
while operating costs were 4.5 per cent higher (excluding a one-off charge
in the 1993 quarter). However, profits were buoyed by a fall in the
loan-loss provision to Dollars 100m in the current quarter from Dollars 298m
a year ago.
The bank's net interest margin, meanwhile, fell by five basis points
(hundredths of a percentage point) to 3.68 per cent. The decline was was
held in check by a shift in the mix of loans from a year earlier: US
commercial lending fell to Dollars 30.2bn from Dollars 34.7bn, while
consumer lending, where margins are generally higher, rose to Dollars 26.5bn
from Dollars 24bn.
Net income was lower than a year before, when profits had been boosted by a
tax credit. Leaving aside this factor, after-tax income rose 24 per cent
over the year-ago quarter.
Chase Manhattan also benefited from a lower loan-loss provision, which fell
from Dollars 215m in the 1993 period to Dollars 100m. Total revenues
remained steady at Dollars 1.64bn, while operating costs rose 4 per cent.
The net interest margin, meanwhile, slipped 18 basis points from a year ago,
to 3.81 per cent. Mr William Maletz, head of investor relations, said the
decline reflected the growth of lower-yielding, liquid trading account
assets held by the bank. The pressure on margins in part reflects growing
competition in the credit card and residential mortgage businesses.
Chase said it expected margins on these products to increase next year, as
it launches new credit card products to compete with the growing array of
non-bank co-branded cards in the US market and as the residential mortgage
business recovers from this year's low level of refinancing activity.
While total loans remained steady with a year before, consumer lending
increased by Dollars 4.4bn to Dollars 37.4bn, commercial lending fell
Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 20.5bn and the bank's real estate portfolio fell
Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 1.2bn.
Wells Fargo's earnings were supported by a Dollars 36m gain from changes
made to its portfolio of premises. Otherwise, total revenues were largely
unchanged. Loan-loss provision fell to Dollars 50m, from Dollars 120m in the
third quarter of 1993.
While loans grew 4 per cent, the net interest margin fell 12 basis points,
to 5.53 per cent.
BancOne, meanwhile, saw after-tax earnings fall by 14 per cent, in part the
result of the interest-rate management policy it adopted before the turn in
US rates this year.
The bank had already reported a Dollars 13m loss from the sale of Dollars
2bn of US government bonds during the quarter. Mr John McCoy, chairman, said
yesterday: 'We remain committed to reduce (our) exposure to rising interest
rates.'
The earlier interest-rate policy was part of the reason behind the fall in
the bank's net interest margin, from 6.11 a year ago to 5.27 per cent in the
latest period. The bank blamed this fall in the margin on higher interest
rates and 'increased competition in loan pricing'.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bouygues ahead 18% midway at
FFr94m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bouygues, the French construction, property and media group, yesterday
reported an 18 per cent rise in first-half net consolidated profit to FFr94m
(Dollars 17.76m), up from FFr79m in the same period of 1993.
The group said that results at the dominant construction division, in terms
of turnover, failed to reflect the general economic improvement in France,
while in Africa it had had to contend with last January's 50 per cent
devaluation of the CFA franc. The weak market in real estate led to a
decline in revenue from property.
Consolidated turnover rose to FFr33.6bn in the first half from the FFr29.3bn
achieved in January-June of last year. However, this increase was due to
accounting changes which allow Bouygues to consolidate in its figures
turnover from TF1, the leading French television station in which Bouygues
raised its stake to a controlling 34 per cent at the start of this year.
The group predicted turnover of around FFr69bn for the full year, up from
FFr61.2bn last year but again entirely accounted for by the newly-included
activities of TF1.
Earlier this month the consortium of which it is a member won from the
French government the right to develop a third mobile phone network in
France.

goods sales slow

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Slow demand for luxury goods hurt interim sales at Japanese department
stores, in spite of last summer's rise in consumer confidence due to a cut
in income tax and hot weather.
Takashimaya posted a 3.8 per cent decline in unconsolidated sales to Y342bn
(Dollars 3.94bn) for the first six months to August because of sluggish
consumer and corporate demand.
Pre-tax profits jumped 2.5 times to Y976m due to a Y6bn cut in costs
although after-tax profits fell 31.3 per cent to Y1.32bn.
For the full year to February, the company expects pre-tax profits to rise
20.3 per cent to Y3.3bn on a 2.9 per cent decline in sales to Y702bn.
Daimaru said parent sales for the first half fell 2.4 per cent to Y261.4bn
while pre-tax profits dropped 20.7 per cent to Y1.1bn. After-tax profits
rose 3.4 per cent to Y527m.
Sales of women's wear rose 2.5 per cent, but sluggish furniture and consumer
electronics sales hurt revenue growth. The company cut costs by Y1.8bn.
Pre-tax profits for the full year are forecast to fall 4.6 per cent to
Y4.5bn on a 1.2 per cent decline in sales to Y536.6bn.
Matsuzakaya said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months
to August dropped 46.8 per cent to Y711m. Sales declined 6.7 per cent to
Y214.9bn due to lower spending per customer.
After-tax profits fell 25 per cent to Y574m. For the full year to next
February, it expects sales to fall 4.8 per cent to Y437bn and a 22.8 per
cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y2.2bn.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: GAN drops to FFr846m deficit at
midway

Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the state-controlled French
insurance group which is a candidate for privatisation, yesterday reported
losses of FFr846m (Dollars 159.92m) for the six months to June 30, compared
with profits of FFr372m for the same period last year.
Group revenues rose slightly to FFr63bn, against FFr62.3bn last time.
The group's property financing subsidiary, Union Industrielle de Credit, saw
its losses deepen to FFr925m from FFr30m in the first half of last year as a
result of substantial provisions for a restructuring agreed earlier this
month.
GAN's domestic life assurance profits were down slightly at FFr344m,
compared with FFr355m.
However, its fire and accident insurance division reported a sharp increase
in losses, to FFr736m from FFr403m.
The group's banking unit, Groupe CIC, continued to grow, reporting profits
of FFr328m against FFr257m.
These were the first results to be presented by Mr Jean-Jacques Bonnaud, who
was appointed head of GAN at the end of June by the government, in
succession to Mr Francois Heilbronner.
Mr Bonnaud said the losses reflected a number of exceptional factors,
including a deterioration in casualty insurance, a reduction in realised
gains, a series of provisions and the restructuring of UIC.
Mr Bonnaud said the situation should improve in the second half, although he
warned that 'a return to profitability by the end of the year is not on the
cards'.
He conceded that losses were likely to delay prospects for privatisation,
although his objective was to prepare GAN for sale 'with the shortest
possible delay'.
GAN is one of 21 state-owned groups slated for sale by the government of
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur.

Shares in Gaic, the Italian finance company, rose by nearly 9 per cent
yesterday, following comments on Monday by the chairman of Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin), the financial holding company which controls a large
stake in Gaic.
Mr Guido Rossi was reported to have said that Ferfin was 'examining the
problem' of Gaic, which in turn owns about 30 per cent of Fondiaria, the
quoted Italian insurer.
Gaic has been at the centre of speculation for months, and the markets
yesterday interpreted Mr Rossi's comment as a hint that Ferfin was set to
mount abid for the 20 per cent of Gaic freely traded.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: GE ahead despite losses at
Kidder
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Electric, the diversified US conglomerate, shrugged off losses at
its Kidder Peabody investment banking subsidiary with a 13 per cent rise in
third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 1.37bn.
GE Capital Services, the financial services division which includes Kidder,
raised net earnings 7 per cent to Dollars 526m. This was in spite of
Kidder's net operating loss of Dollars 85m.
GE said seven of its 12 divisions had produced double-digit rises in
operating profit: the NBC broadcasting network, plastics, motors,
appliances, power systems, lighting and information services.
Only one division, aircraft engines, failed to produce sales growth in the
quarter. The unit, which has been hit in the past two years by a downturn in
civil and military orders, also suffered a fall in operating profit.
GE said on Monday it would take a fourth-quarter charge of about Dollars
500m on the sale of parts of Kidder Peabody to rival broking firm
Paine-Webber. Mr Jack Welch, GE chairman, said yesterday: 'This transaction
and the record level of performance demonstrated this year by our other
businesses position us well for the future.'
GE's involvement with Kidder, which has cost it about Dollars 1.5bn, has
exposed Mr Welch to criticism.
Further potential embarrassment comes next week with the opening of a court
case in Columbus, Ohio charging GE and De Beers, the South African mining
group, with collusion over the price of artificial diamonds.
Discussions on the future of NBC were continuing with various parties, the
company said.
However, it reiterated that it was looking for ways of strengthening the
business rather than selling it outright. Suitors for all or part of NBC
have been said to include Time Warner, Walt Disney, Turner Broadcasting and
ITT.
'We think NBC is very well positioned for future growth. If there were ways
of helping that along, we'd look at it,' GE said. Making no change was also
an option, it added.
Group sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 16.2bn, and operating margins rose to
12.8 per cent from 11.6 per cent. Operating cash flow in the quarter
remained steady at Dollars 2.6bn.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Statoil and Saga prepare NKr40bn
energy venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Two of Norway's biggest oil and gas companies will today announce details of
an asset swap programme which will clear the way for a NKr40bn (Dollars
5.6bn) joint development plan for gas fields in the Norwegian Sea.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Saga Petroleum, Norway's
largest independent oil company, will swap operational control of oil and
gas fields in the North Sea and in fields off mid-Norway. There may be a
swap of shareholdings between the companies.
The government is also expected to disclose details of a deal in which the
state will sell a large shareholding to Saga in either or both the Smoerbukk
South and Smoerbukk gas and condensate fields in the Norwegian Sea.
The NKr40bn co-ordinated development of these fields has long been stalled
by doubts about the fields' economic viability and by differences of opinion
over oil companies' investment priorities. The restructuring of the oil and
gas assets and their co-ordinated development will allow the companies to
share investment objectives.
The developments will provide much-needed orders for Norway's oil supply
industry whose order books have shrunk due to a fall in investment activity
by oil companies and in which restructuring will force the loss of thousands
of jobs.
The economically depressed mid-Norway region near Kristiansund also stands
to benefit greatly from their development.
Statoil is understood to have agreed to exchange its operation in the North
Sea of its 80m barrel Fenris oil field for Saga's operation of the 100bn
cubic metre Midgard gas field.
In August, Saga acquired a 50 per cent stake in Fenris from Esso Norge.
Financial details were not disclosed. Statoil holds a 20 per cent stake in
the field while the state owns a 30 per cent direct financial interest.
In the Midgard field, which comprises two licences and is situated in
Haltenbanken off mid-Norway, Statoil will assume Saga's operation in exhange
for its Fenris operation. Statoil holds a 51 per cent stake in each of the
Midgard licences. The state directly holds 31.4 per cent. Saga Petroleum has
9.8 per cent.
The Smoerbukk field, where the state is understood to have agreed to sell
all or part of its 31.4 per cent shareholding to Saga, is operated by
Statoil with a 19.6 per cent shareholding. Smoerbukk contains 95bn cubic
metres of gas and 37m cubic metres of condensate.
The Smoerbukk South field contains 20bn cubic metres of gas and an estimated
150m barrels of oil. The Midgard field was discovered in 1981 while
Smoerbukk was discovered in 1984 and Smoerbukk South in 1985.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Enso-Gutzeit buys stake in
Veitsiluoto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Enso-Gutzeit said last night that it was strengthening its operations in the
Finnish pulp and paper sector by buying a 35 per cent stake in Veitsiluoto,
a state-owned forestry company, for FM1.5bn (Dollars 324m).
The move will make Enso one of Europe's leading producers of fine papers and
newsprint.
The government retains a majority stake in Veitsiluoto but has given Enso an
option to buy the holding if it decides to sell.
Mr Matti Vuoria, secretary-general of Finland's Ministry of Trade and
Industry, said Enso had defeated a rival bid from Metsa-Serla, one of its
domestic rivals, because it had made 'a clearly better offer'.
Enso will pay FM1bn directly to the state and use the remaining FM500m to
strengthen Veitsiluoto's equity. The government holds 33.7 per cent of the
capital and 52.1 per cent of the votes in Enso.
The sale is politically sensitive because Veitsiluoto's operating units are
based in the north of Finland and are important for local employment. Enso
has undertaken to study the feasibility of making a big investment at Oulu,
where Veitsiluoto has recently commissioned a new fine-paper machine.
Veitsiluoto made a FM150m loss after financial items in 1993 on turnover of
FM4.82bn.
Enso yesterday reported a FM872m profit after financial items for the first
eight months, compared with a FM186m profit in the same 1993 period. Sales
advanced to FM11.3bn from FM10.2bn.
Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, said the improving trend would continue
in the final four months, giving the group a 'much better' full-year profit
than last year's FM406m. 'Prices for paperboard and for standard and
speciality newsprint will be raised during the final four months,' he said.
The group announced FM650m in new investments. The biggest project, worth
FM400m, involves the construction of a pulp plant and process water
treatment plant.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rautaruukki in profit for first
eight months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rautaruukki, the Finnish steel group, yesterday reported a return to profit
in the first eight months of the year, posting a pre-tax surplus of FM361m
(Dollars 78m) after a (restated) loss in the same period last year of
FM143m.
The group, the Nordic region's second largest steel producer, said the
increase in demand and prices in Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe that
fuelled the turnround were expected to continue for the rest of the year,
yielding a further improvement in profitability.
Group sales rose to FM4.86bn from FM4.57bn. Rautaruukki said steel prices
rose faster than the cost of inputs, with prices rising especially sharply
for hot and cold-rolled products.
Operating profit jumped 35 per cent to FM624m from FM463m and would have
been greater but for a FM60m loss run up by the group's engineering
division.
However, net interest costs fell to FM309m from FM364m and there was a FM46m
extraordinary surplus, compared with an extraordinary charge of FM77m last
time, due to changes in inventory values.
Rautaruukki raised FM792m earlier this year in a global share offering that
led to a drop in the Finnish state's shareholding in the group to 68.7 per
cent from 81.1 per cent.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Repola and Kymmene return to

forestry industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Repola and Kymmene, two of Finland's big four forestry groups, yesterday
reported large swings back to profit in the first eight months of the year
after losses in the same period last year. The recovery followed sharply
reduced financial charges.
Both reported high capacity utilisation - 94 per cent in the case of
Kymmene's paper mills - and said demand in Europe for forestry products and
paper was likely to remain strong.
The results were in line with resurgent profitability in the Nordic forestry
industry this year. They covered a period during which Repola and Kymmene
came close to agreeing a merger between Kymmene and United Paper Mills, the
forestry group and main component of Repola. Talks broke down in June.
Repola reported pre-tax profits in the first eight months of FM1.17bn
(Dollars 252m), a turnround from a restated loss of FM119m in the same
period last year. Repola and Kymmene restated 1993 figures to conform with
European Union accounting principles.
Turnover rose to FM18.36bn from FM17.77bn and operating profit grew to
FM2.11bn from FM1.67bn. Financial expenses fell FM792m due to lower interest
rates and a reduction in group debts.
Operating profits at UPM rose to FM1.8bn from FM1.48bn on turnover up at
FM12.56bn from FM11.74bn. Repola said the increase in turnover was due to
marked growth in its paper and mechanical wood processing businesses.
Repola's engineering division, Rauma, saw sales increase to FM5.18bn from
FM5.03bn. But operating profits doubled to FM247m from FM124m.
At Kymmene, there was a swing to a FM545m profit in the first eight months
from a FM337m (restated) loss. Sales rose to FM12.11bn from FM10.98bn,
thanks mainly to higher sales of fine papers, panels and sawn timber. Value
of sales fell FM700m as the markka appreciated.
Operating profit rose to FM1.32bn from FM944bn. Net financial charges
tumbled to FM846m from FM1.2bn.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: GAS shareholders foil speculative investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in Gartmore American Securities yesterday foiled the attempt of
a speculative investor, believed to be American, to grab an unfair share of
the trust's assets by exploiting an anomaly in the terms of the debenture
stock.
The Pounds 51m trust, which was restructured as a split capital investment
trust five years ago, had a provisional wind-up date of March 1995.
The Pounds 3m debenture stock's official repayment terms are 100p in 2014,
but if the trust is wound up earlier, debenture holders are entitled to the
average mid-market price of the stock in the three months before wind-up,
subject to a cap of 300p. Any extra payment above 100p is at the expense of
the ordinary shareholders.
An unidentified speculator, acting through Goldman Sachs, acquired 93 per
cent of the debenture stock, and succeeded in pushing up its mid-market
price from 114p from August to 300p in September. Gartmore responded by
giving early notice of the wind-up meeting, so that the debenture
entitlement was restricted to 206p.
At an extraordinary general meeting yesterday, shareholders voted to
relinquish their rights to block an extension of the life of the trust.
The board is now working on proposals for a restructuring of the trust which
would roll over most of the assets, while giving investors a fair cash offer
if they want to withdraw.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Paterson Zochonis shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Paterson Zochonis fell 51p to 438p yesterday after the detergent
and soap manufacturer warned that profits for the current half year would be
hurt by problems in Nigeria.
The statement accompanied results for the year to the end of May showing
pre-tax profits up from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 28.1m, while sales increased
from Pounds 233.4m to Pounds 266.6m.
Operating profits at the group, 65 per cent held by the Zochonis family, the
directors and related interests, were ahead from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds
15.4m. The share of profits from associated companies - mainly in Nigeria -
increased from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 4.73m.
Nigeria accounts for about 30 per cent of sales. Mr Alan Whittaker, finance
director, said that the group's operations there were suffering from a lack
of foreign exchange in the banking system, hitting their ability to import
sufficient raw materials.
Factory throughput would have to be reduced, Mr Whittaker said, and exports
of chemicals from the UK to Nigeria would also fall.
He hoped to see some improvement after the Nigerian budget at the beginning
of next year.
The second most important contributor to the group is Cussons in the UK,
which accounted for sales of about Pounds 65m. Mr Whittaker said Cussons,
owner of the Imperial Leather brand, had improved its share of the liquid
soap market from 5 to 20 per cent, and had slightly increased its market
share for conventional soap to 23-24 per cent.
The Polish detergents operation, acquired in March last year, exceeded
expectations and contributed Pounds 25m to turn-over.
Profits were ahead in Australia and Thailand, and the Indonesian operations
looked like moving into the black this year.
Profits in Greece recovered from low olive oil prices and a decision on a
second factory was expected soon.
The pre-tax line was struck after investment income of Pounds 13.9m (Pounds
16.4m) and payment of Pounds 5.87m (Pounds 5.73m) in interest. The balance
sheet shows investments of Pounds 167m.
Mr Whittaker said further acquisitions were possible, but they were likely
to be modest purchases in areas where markets were expanding, such as
eastern Europe.
Earnings per share emerged at 36.6p (32.01p). A final dividend of 11.4p is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.85p (12.6p).

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stakis hotels improve in last quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stakis, the hotels and casinos group, yesterday reported an encouraging
performance in its hotel operations and some improvement in its casinos in
the last quarter of its financial year.
The company was issuing its first quarterly trading statement and will not
produce its results for the year to October 2 until January 10 1995.
In the hotels division there was a 1 percentage point rise in occupancy in
the quarter to 77.9 per cent, whereas in the year there was a 1.2 points
rise to 69.7 per cent.
Stakis pushed up its average room rate by Pounds 1.57 in the quarter to
Pounds 41.61 and by Pounds 1.89 in the year to Pounds 41.63.
The average number of rooms available increased from 3,758 in the third
quarter of 1993 to 4,201 in the third quarter of 1994, which reflects the
acquisition of four hotels.
However, Stakis said none of the newly purchased hotels had made a big
impact on the result for the year. Two of them, the Arundel Hotel in West
Sussex and the Bath Hotel, Avon, were only acquired in the summer.
The Norwich Hotel, Norfolk, acquired in April, made a broadly neutral
contribution and the Coburg Hotel in London, acquired in March, suffered
from low margin tour business which had been accepted before the hotel
changed hands.
In casinos, attendances rose by 7 per cent over last year as a whole, but
were up only 0.6 per cent in the quarter. Average spend per head on casino
chips rose by 8.1 per cent to Pounds 134 in the quarter and by 6.8 per cent
cumulatively to Pounds 126.
Cash drop - the total amount spent on chips - was up 8.8 per cent in the
quarter and 13.8 per cent in the year, mainly reflecting the addition of
three new casinos in the Midlands.
However, the gaming margin (the percentage of bets which the casino retains)
fell by 0.8 percentage points to 17.3 per cent in the quarter, though it was
0.2 percentage points higher in the year as a whole.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Henry Boot advances by 10% despite pressure
on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Henry Boot, the construction and property group, increased pre-tax profits
by 10 per cent at the interim stage despite pressure on margins in building
and civil engineering.
The Sheffield-based company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.57m (Pounds
2.35m) on turnover up 11 per cent from Pounds 64.6m to Pounds 72.1m for the
six months to June 30.
However, it warned that overcapacity in the market would continue to depress
pre-tax margins - down slightly to 3.57 per cent (3.63 per cent) - as
increased house sales were not accompanied by price rises.
'There is still a lot of competition for too little work,' said Mr Jamie
Boot, managing director. 'We are overcoming that to a large degree by being
fairly selective in the type of work we tender for, tendering for building
work rather than civil engineering.'
The company's outlook on construction activities improved after winning a
Pounds 26m contract at Connah's Quay power station, near Chester, from
GEC-Alsthom.
Housing sales increased in the early part of the year, but have slowed since
May. The company said the housing market was still coming to terms with the
interest rate rise in September, although demand had recovered this month.
The overall performance was helped by property investment and development
activities, which enjoyed a high level of enquiries from institutions for
ongoing developments.
Earnings per share climbed 8 per cent to 6.8p (6.3p). The interim dividend
is 1.85p (1.7p).

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Filtronic Comtek priced at 105p - Valuation
of cellular components group well below expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Filtronic Comtek, a manufacturer of components for the cellular
mobile telecommunications industry, were priced yesterday at 105p each.
This values the group at Pounds 44.1m, well below expectations which had
ranged as high as Pounds 60m.
The company is placing 23.8m shares - 57 per cent per cent of the enlarged
equity - with institutional investors.
The flotation price is understood to have been marked down 'to a more
realistic' level after discussions with potential investors and in the light
of market conditions.
In recent weeks several new issues - including Independent British
Healthcare, Martin Retail Group and Seaperfect - have been postponed while a
handful of other recently listed companies are trading well below their
offer prices.
Mr Tim Linacre, a director of corporate finance at Panmure Gordon, the
underwriter, sponsor and broker to the Filtronic Comtek issue, acknowledged
that the price was 'at the bottom of the range' of forecasts.
He pointed out, however, that under a share option scheme covering five
directors and other key employees, exercisable over the next six years, a
further 6.85m shares could be issued lifting the group's market
capitalisation, based on the flotation price, to Pounds 51.3m.
Mr Linacre admitted that the new issue market had been 'a bit sticky' in the
wake of the share price collapse of some recent new issues such as
Aerostructures Hamble. However, he said there had been good demand from
institutions for Filtronic Comtek shares, 'which had been priced sensibly'.
Under the placing 9.5m shares are being sold by existing shareholders
including Professor David Rhodes, the Leeds University academic who formed
the original Filtronic company in 1977. Filtronic Comtek was demerged from
Filtronic at the end of June.
Prof Rhodes, the executive chairman, is raising Pounds 1.4m through the
placing but will retain an 11.5 per cent interest in the expanded capital.
The remaining 14.3m shares in the placing are being issued by the company to
raise Pounds 13.8m net of expenses.
Prof Rhodes said the net proceeds 'will be used to fund the expansion,
including investment in new facilities, capital equipment and research and
development, as well as reducing borrowings and providing funds for working
capital.'
Sales in the company, which manufacturers high technology products for use
in cellular telephone base stations, have grown from Pounds 1.23m in 1992 to
Pounds 10.2m in the year to May 31.
Over the same period pre-tax profits have increased tenfold to Pounds 1.11m,
equivalent to fully diluted earnings per share of 2.39p.
The shares are due to start trading on Monday.

William Bedford, the USM-traded antique dealer and restorer, staged a
profits recovery as sales almost doubled in the six months to June 30.
On turnover of Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 651,556), the pre-tax line confirmed the
recovery shown in the second half of the preceding year with profits of
Pounds 96,706 against losses of Pounds 10,898.
Earnings per share were 1.8p (losses of 0.2p).
However, Mr John Bedford, chairman, warned that margins remained 'under
considerable pressure' and sounded a warning on current trading.
'The recovery in sales (in the first half) has not so far been maintained in
the second half. Sales in July were significantly below those of last year,
while August and September have been exceptionally quiet.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Castle Mill losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Castle Mill International, the wholesale distributor of clothing, saw
pre-tax losses increase from Pounds 256,000 to Pounds 322,900 in the first
half of 1994. Turnover was virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.04m. The company
said the result reflected the seasonal nature of turnover in Fashion

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: English China makes Dollars 45.4m chemicals
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English China Clays, the minerals and chemicals group, is making its first
acquisition since its decision earlier this year to demerge Camas, its
construction materials arm, and expand the speciality chemicals division
In the first stage of a Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) acquisition strategy, the
group said it was paying Dollars 45.4m for EZE Products, the US supplier of
speciality chemicals to the paper and surface-treatment industries.
The deal will strengthen ECC's presence in the North American chemicals
industry, where it established a foothold last year with the Pounds 202m
acquisition of Calgon, the former Merck subsidiary.
Mr Andrew Teare, chief executive, predicted the group would also make a
similar sized purchase in continental Europe, although a deal was not
imminent.
'We're pleased to get a decent size acquisition under our belts, and we will
now focus the business on production for the paper industry,' he said.
City analysts, however, said the move looked expensive given that EZE's net
assets were valued at Dollars 7.4m, a sixth of the purchase price, at the
end of last year.
'On a pro forma basis, it would have made a negligible profit contribution,'
said one analyst. 'Chemicals will remain only a small part of ECC, and I
think it will be 1996 before we see a sizeable profits increase from
speciality chemicals.'
EZE last year made profits of Dollars 1.2m, before tax and interest, on
turnover of Dollars 33.7m. In the same period, Calgon contributed Pounds
7.2m to ECC's Pounds 105.2m operating profits.
Mr Teare, however, said the business would not only improve ECC's exposure
to the fast-growing paper chemicals market, but would give it an important
presence on the west coast and in the southern US.
The company would also achieve annual cost savings of Dollars 3.1m following
its integration into Calgon, he added.
Although Calgon's paper operations will be relocated from Pittsburgh to
EZE's manufacturing base in South Carolina, the new subsidiary was warned
that up to 20 per cent of its 235 staff would be made redundant.
The acquisition is being funded from cash resources, and is expected to push
net borrowings up to Pounds 190m for gearing of about 35 per cent.
It is expected to use further borrowing to finance its next chemicals
acquisition, but gearing should remain modest while ECC continues to sell
its land bank, which is worth up to Pounds 70m at present market prices.
Analysts applauded the industrial logic behind the diversification into
speciality chemicals, but predicted it could be earnings dilutive in the
short-term.
The shares closed down 2p at 365p.

The cost of the move, which forms part of the restructuring of the group's

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N sells German engine seals subsidiary to
SKF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
T&amp;N, the automotive components and engineering group, yesterday said it was
selling Goetze Elastomere - its German engine seals subsidiary - to SKF, the
world's leading manufacturer of roller bearings.
The Swedish group is understood to be paying more than Pounds 20m for the
Cologne-based business, which T&amp;N inherited last year following its DM250m
(Pounds 102m) acquisition of Goetze, the German piston ring producer.
Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman, said: 'The activities of Goetze Elastomere do
not fit in with the rest of the group's product range and we believe that
the company and its employees will benefit from being part of a group with a
larger worldwide presence in this particular market.'
SKF plans to integrate the business into its core seals and bearings
division, complementing existing operations in North America and Italy.
'We've been looking for an opportunity in Germany for some time, and this
will improve our position in the European automotive market,' said Mr Lars
Malmer of SKF.
T&amp;N had indicated earlier that the deal could signal the start of a series
of non-core disposals aimed at reducing the group's Pounds 362.6m net
borrowings, equivalent to gearing of 60 per cent.
By helping to reduce gearing, such disposals are likely to give the UK group
additional borrowing capacity should it decide to buy a majority stake in
Kolbenschmidt, a German motor components manufacturer. Last month, T&amp;N
acquired options on a 52.2 per cent stake in the piston and bearings
company, which could greatly strengthen its position in the German market.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Emap expands magazine distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Emap, the publishing and exhibitions group, is expanding its presence in the
magazine distribution market in the UK through a joint venture with Hachette
Distribution Services.
Hachette is forming a 50-50 joint venture with Frontline, a consortium in
which Emap is the majority shareholder. The other Frontline shareholders are
the BBC and Haymarket.
Frontline, founded by Emap, is devoted to the distribution and trade
marketing of magazines produced by its three owners and that will continue.
The new distribution company, called Seymour, will be aimed at 'third party
business' - distributing magazines for other organisations under contract.
Emap already has close links with Hachette. They publish jointly three
former Murdoch titles, Elle, Elle Decoration and Sky.
The existing Seymour company has 4 per cent of the magazine distribution
market in the UK by retail value, compared with Frontline's 19 per cent.
Seymour already distributes magazines such as Time International, The
Spectator, National Geographic and Investors Chronicle.
Mr Geoff Stott, Frontline's chief executive, will also become chairman of
Seymour and Mr Lloyd Wigglesworth becomes managing director of Frontline.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scantronic Holdings, the security components company, is raising a total of
Pounds 2.8m net in new equity and borrowings following agreement from its
shareholders at an extraordinary meeting.
About Pounds 1.2m is being raised through a placing and open offer of 16.1m
new ordinary shares at 10p each while a further Pounds 1.6m will be provided
by additional bank facilities. The proceeds would provide sufficient working
capital for the group's current needs, the directors said.
They also announced that there would be pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.4m
for the half year to September 30 after an exceptional Pounds 1.7m
reflecting the costs of the revised bank facilities and recent
reorganisation of the group's operations. Profits last time were Pounds 1.4m
restated.
Losses per share are expected at 7.71p (1.4p earnings).
The directors do not expect to make any dividend payments, including
preference dividends, for this year.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Laporte aims to fill gap with Perchem deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday said it was discussing
with Akzo Nobel the possible acquisition of the Dutch-based group's Perchem
business.
The UK group wants to add Akzo Nobel's small UK subsidiary to fill a gap in
its chemical production. Perchem manufactures so-called organoclays -
absorbent products with applications ranging from adhesiveness in paints and
inks to liquid clarification.
'The purchase price will probably be in the low millions,' Laporte said.
Although the details have yet to be finalised, the company yesterday
received clearance from the department of trade and industry to pursue the
deal. 'Negotiations are therefore continuing with a view to a very early
completion,' the company added.
The move follows the merger last year of Akzo of the Netherlands with Nobel
Industries, the Swedish chemicals group.
Since then, the group has divested from some non-core areas and concentrated
on coatings, chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barrs claim majority backing for campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas and Robert Barr, the brothers who are attempting to unseat their
uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust,
yesterday claimed that the holders of more than 50 per cent of the voting
shares were backing their campaign.
The brothers said they had majority support among ordinary shareholders for
their attempts to take control of the board and change strategy at the motor
distribution and leisure group. Mr Kerry Firth, a Barnsley-based businessman
who owns 16 per cent of voting shares, is one of those who has pledged
support.
Nicholas and Robert are the sons of Mr Stuart Barr, the managing director
who died two years ago. They speak for nearly 30 per cent of the group's
voting shares.
However, the Barr &amp; Wallace board launched a counter attack yesterday by
proposing to enfranchise the company's non-voting shares, owned mainly by
institutions. Ironically, enfranchisement has been one of the rebels'
principal proposals.
The board said that a vote on enfranchisement would take place before an EGM
called by the Barr brothers. The brothers demanded the EGM last week to
unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance
director.
Malcolm Barr said: 'Enfranchisement is such an important issue in terms of
increasing shareholder value and future progress of the group that it merits
being voted on in its own right.'
The board is proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue to ordinary shareholders to
compensate them for the loss of voting control. It also intends to maintain
the final dividend on the enlarged share capital.
A circular is to be sent to shareholders no later than October 28, with a
meeting expected by mid-November.
The Barr brothers plan to split the group's motor and leisure divisions and
reduce central overheads.
'We felt for some time that the two divisions did not have anything in
common and gained no strategic benefit by being linked to each other,' said
Nicholas Barr, who was development director of the Barr &amp; Wallace motor
division until his resignation in September last year.
'I got a lot of personal pent-up frustration by seeing the group spend money
on hotels and not being able to develop the motor business.
'We also believe there are potentially more effective ways to use the
company's capital than buying property assets. The board has failed to find
sensible niche markets to bolt on to the leisure activities.'
The board counters the brothers' arguments by pointing to a 40 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits in the six months to June. Pre-tax profits stood at
Pounds 928,000 on turnover up 15 per cent to Pounds 124m.
Mr Small and Mr Parker were appointed in May. Since then operations disposed
of include Trust Leasing, sold to Robert Barr for Pounds 2.15m in July.

FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Boardroom shake-up at Arcon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A boardroom row at Arcon International Resources, the Irish company in which
Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz Foods, has a 23 per cent stake, has
resulted in the resignation of Mr Richard Conroy as chairman and chief
executive.
Mr James Jones, director responsible for finance, and Ms Maureen Jones,
responsible for administration and management, have also given up their
executive functions but, like Mr Conroy, who founded Arcon, are staying on
the board.
Arcon said that it had been informed by the three directors 'of their
declared inability to carry out their respective executive functions as, in
their opinion, the company had unilaterally and wrongfully repudiated their
contracts.'
Mr Conroy said last night that for the past 2 1/2 years his executive
functions were gradually eroded 'until it became a nonsense. In practice we
were not observing any serious executive function.' He said he would consult
his lawyers but 'I don't wish to harm the company I founded.'
Mr Brendan Gilmore, who has been appointed chairman and chief executive,
said he did not know why the directors had taken this action. 'We refute
totally any allegations of constructive dismissal.'
He said the one contentious issue between Arcon and Mr Conroy was the
private company he set up last year and whether it was to become an
exploration company. If it was, there would have been a possible conflict of
interest.
Mr Gilmore said Arcon was at an exciting and strenuous stage, and, once the
directors announced last week they had given up their executive roles, the
gaps had to be filled immediately. Mr Tony O'Reilly Jnr has been appointed
deputy chief executive, Mr Gilmore's previous role.
Arcon is preparing to start a Dollars 65m (Pounds 41m) lead-zinc mine at
Galmoy in County Kilkenny, Ireland's first new base metals mine for 20
years. With his associates, Mr O'Reilly controls 29.9 per cent of the
company while Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish resources group, owns 21.6
per cent. Mr Conroy, with associates and family, owns about 5 per cent.
Mr O'Reilly moved into Arcon, then called Conroy Petroleum, when it acquired
his Atlantic Resources for Pounds 7.7m in 1992. Mr Conroy is also a
professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and an Irish Senator.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Recovery in rental levels behind Town
Centre advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in rental levels helped Town Centre Securities, the Leeds-based
property group, report a 9 per cent rise in annual profits to Pounds 8.81m.
Mr Edward Ziff, chairman, said the company had increased its purchases in
the retail market to take advantage of the rise, although this had so far
been limited to the top end of the market. 'The prime retail market is
stronger than its ever been in terms of rental value and incentives to let
are being withdrawn at a rate of knots,' he said.
An internal property valuation showed values increased by 11 per cent and
helped net asset value per share rise 20 per cent to 150.63p (125.18p), and
by 21 per cent to 148.98p (123.07p) on a diluted basis.
The shares gained 5p to 122p yesterday.
The freehold proportion of the group's investments jumped from 66 to 96 per
cent following the purchase of the freeholds on the Merrion Centre in Leeds
and a smaller site in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. These boosted the group's
investment expenditure from Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m for the year.
Mr Ziff said that secondary retail sites were still not showing any signs of
rental growth. 'Rent review activity is very tough in those areas,' he said.
The pre-tax figure was slightly ahead of most forecasts and prompted
analysts to generally move their profit forecasts for 1994-95 ahead
slightly. The average moved from about Pounds 8.5m to upwards of Pounds 9m,
with a net asset value of about 170p.
Gross revenue for the year to June 30 rose 10 per cent to Pounds 20m (Pounds
18.2m). The tax charge declined from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.89m, leaving
earnings per share ahead 19 per cent to 6.75p (5.65p). The dividend is
increased from 3.4p to 3.8p, with a final of 2.6p.
A 1-for-4 scrip issue was also announced.

Sidlaw Group, the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and textiles

The issue was priced at 180p a share. The shares closed down 17p at 208p.

It also said that, while the textiles division remained in the black -
operating profits for the six months to March 31 were Pounds 326,000 (Pounds
298,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 12.3m) - the division was no
longer central and would be sold.
In July 1993, the group acquired the flexible packaging businesses of
Courtaulds for Pounds 78m, funded in part by a Pounds 53m rights issue at
275p. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said that 'more than half of the
current expenditure needed for the division could not have been foreseen at
the time of the acquisition'.
Mr Morrow said the division, while 'exceeding expectations', had 'pressing
requirements'. He did not want to get to the position where customers could
be disappointed. Behind the cash call, he said, lay the need to provide a
pan-European service, called Tranflex, operated in partnership with the
customer.
This 'partnering' involved standardisation of product quality across the
plants in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Spain. At the same time the
cost base needed to be reduced, said Mr Morrow, via reorganisation and
upgrading of production facilities.
While the rights is raising some Pounds 24m, the group will have access to a
total of Pounds 36m, thanks to a Pounds 12m additional borrowing capacity.
Reorganisation will use up Pounds 15m; support for customers - particularly
a greenfield investment 'for an existing blue chip customer's expansion' -
will take Pounds 9m; about Pounds 5m will be invested in the French and
Spanish plants; and some Pounds 3m will go on another production line in
Bristol.
The initial effect of the rights issue will be to reduce gearing, which
stood at 73 per cent at the half-way point. Morgan Grenfell are the
underwriters and Cazenove the brokers.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Why Walker has changed horses - The banker
who is leaving Lloyds for Morgan Stanley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Walker did not look a disappointed man yesterday.
This was despite having apparently forsaken the opportunity to chair
Britain's most successful bank, and a leading FT-SE 100 index company, for
the sort of role at a US investment bank that is usually more ambassadorial
than powerful.
Sir David's decision to become executive chairman of Morgan Stanley in
Europe rather than wait for the apparent certainty that he would succeed Sir
Robin Ibbs at Lloyds Bank raises fresh questions for Lloyds.
The bank now has to find both a new chairman and chief executive - to
replace Sir Brian Pitman - in the next two years.
Yet it also appeared enigmatic for Sir David himself.
Most European chairmen of US investment banks have been non-executives
appointed to bring City contacts and act as figureheads. Is that the role
for someone who describes himself as being 'reasonably creative' and having
'huge energy'?
Sir David's answer is an emphatic 'yes' on two grounds.
One is the nature of his role at Lloyds, where he thought his job would be
'more executive than is the case' when he arrived in July 1992. It then
seemed that he was being groomed for a rapid elevation, with Sir Robin as a
caretaker.
But Sir Robin, a former executive director of ICI and head of Lady
Thatcher's cabinet office 'think tank' from 1980 to 1982, now appears to be
rather enjoying himself at Lloyds. He has indicated that he would prefer to
hang on to the reins until the annual meeting after his 70th birthday.
The second reason is the nature of the role he is being offered at Morgan
Stanley. At 54, the former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board,
the City regulator, says he could be non-executive chairman of a FT-SE 100
company 'in six or seven years' time, if I want that' but has more active
ambitions now.
Sir David admits that the European chairman of a US investment bank is
normally 'an introducer or a public affairs chap'. But his job will be as
executive chairman of European operations. He will also be a member of the
New York board of directors that runs Morgan Stanley throughout the world.
Morgan Stanley needs such a role as a result of its rapid growth in the past
two years. It generated Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 790m) of revenues in Europe
last year, and if its rate of expansion continues it could produce more
revenue from Europe than the US by the turn of the century.
The firm already employs Mr Francis Maude, the former UK cabinet minister as
managing director of global privatisation work.
Lord Richardson of Duntisbourne, the former governor of the Bank of England,
is also a member of the international advisory board based in its Canary
Wharf offices.
Executive responsibility for Europe is split between its joint chief
executives, Mr Steven Ward and Mr Stephen Waters. Mr Waters said yesterday
that it would 'probably become a triumvirate rather than a duet' once Sir
David had worked his way in and understood the firm's activities.
Mr Waters, who takes particular responsibility for mergers and acquisitions
work and equities, said the firm 'obviously wanted a senior figure who knew
his way around the City', and hoped to boost its presence in the domestic UK
market to the level achieved in some continental European markets.
Sir David argues that his role at Morgan Stanley will be one of
'collaborating, helping, coaxing and contributing,' as well as helping to
decide how the firm should allocate capital in Europe. Its rate of growth
means that there are competing claims among different country operations.
He emphasises that as the only employee of the firm in London without
functional responsibility, he will have a role in arbitrating between
businesses. 'One of the challenges is to ensure that people in business
units do not become so entrenched that we miss synergies,' he says.
Nonetheless, Sir David's move is likely to reduce his previous visibility as
a senior City figure, given the roots of his new employer on Wall Street.
Morgan Stanley's European growth will have to live up to expectations to
compensate for what he is sacrificing at Lloyds.

FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Further defence likely from Attwoods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the waste services company fighting a hostile Pounds 364m bid from
Browning-Ferris Industries of the US, is expected to publish a second
defence document towards the end of next week.
Much could depend on this document, with US investors expecting to take a
firm view on the offer after its publication. 'At this stage, the question
is will Attwoods be able to put enough arguments in the second document or
give a profits forecast to keep investors in the shares', one shareholder
said.
The document is likely to include further details on prospects for 1995 and
indications on the value of Attwoods' assets and business.
A third document, which could include its first quarter results, is also
expected before November 11. This is the last date for publication of new
financial information and should reinforce earlier indications on 1995
profits.
This could put BFI under increased pressure to raise its bid, following
Attwoods' results last week which showed improvements in core operations.
Institutions are believed to want either an increase, or an equity
alternative. An equity option is unlikely, however, given the effect on
BFI's earnings.
BFI is offering 109p in cash and has received acceptance from Attwoods' 29.8
per cent shareholder, Laidlaw of Canada. A further 25 per cent is held by
two institutions in the US, Fidelity and Templeton Investments. Fidelity has
recently reduced its stake from almost 14 per cent to less than 12 per cent.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, is due to begin a round of
presentations in the US today. He will argue the bid undervalues his
company.
It is already clear that institutions accept BFI's argument that future
growth will come through providing integrated waste services.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Struggling APV ousts Strowger: Food processing equipment
group's chief executive leaves after shareholder pressure for new direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Clive Strowger has been ousted as chief executive of APV, the struggling
UK-based food processing equipment specialist which last month halved its
interim dividend and warned it was facing increasing pressure on profit
margins.
His departure, announced yesterday, follows strong pressure from
institutional investors which convinced Sir Peter Cazalet, APV's chairman,
and non-executive directors that they needed to take action. The move
intensified concerns about the direction of APV, a perennial target of
takeover rumours.
APV's shares, which had fallen 30 per cent to 83p immediately after the
results on September 15, slipped 1 1/2 p yesterday to 72 1/2 p, close to
their 1994 low of 70 1/2 p.
APV said Mr Strowger would leave with immediate effect. With a two-year
rolling contract on a basic salary of Pounds 230,000, he could receive a
pay-off approaching Pounds 500,000. In 1993, he was paid Pounds 340,202 in
salary, benefits and performance-related bonus.
Dr Neil French, finance director, is assuming the additional role of chief
executive until a successor is appointed. APV said: 'The half-year results
were not as good as we had hoped, and came as a bit of a shock. There was a
feeling we needed someone to take the company forward at greater speed and
with greater vigour than had been shown.'
Mr Strowger, a former finance director at Grand Metropolitan and chief
executive of Mountleigh, joined APV in June 1992. He played a big part in
the restructuring and redirection of the company that became necessary
because of recession, increasing competition and problems digesting
acquisitions by former chief executive Mr Fred Smith, who left in 1989.
Mr Strowger appears to be carrying the can for last month's interim
statement. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds 5.8m, but the
interim dividend was cut from 2p a share to 1p. More seriously, institutions
and analysts were worried by an unspecified charge that is due to be taken
in the second half for further restructuring of APV's liquid foods division.
City estimates for the charge range from Pounds 10m to Pounds 40m.
Mr Paul Pickford, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: 'The City felt that a lot
more work needed to be done, and that Mr Strowger was not the best man to
pull the company through.'
APV stressed that Mr Strowger's strategy - to move away from low-margin
manufacturing and contracting work to develop specific products and
processes - remained intact. 'It's a pace of change issue,' it said.
However, some analysts remain unconvinced by the strategy. Mr Tim Bennett,
at Albert E. Sharp, said Mr Strowger's departure 'does beg the question as
to whether APV is a problem that has a solution'.
Sir Peter said Mr Strowger's departure did 'not signify that we have found a
black hole in the company, as compared with what we knew last month was not
a particularly happy situation'. He was looking for a chief executive with
'substantial leadership qualities, who would understand this business and
have expertise in manufacturing, marketing and contracting'. Dr French looks
to be the internal front-runner for the job, but two directors, Mr Richard
Fenny and Mr Howard Stanworth, could be considered. APV is also looking
externally using headhunters. 'It will be a real challenge for anyone,' said
Mr Bennett.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Citicorp makes quarterly record after lower taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Citicorp vaulted to the top of the profitability league of big US commercial
banks yesterday with record quarterly profits.
The results were powered by strong advances in all parts of Citicorp's
business, with none of the nasty surprises which have hampered the group's
earnings in recent years.
'It has been a long time since we have had all the cylinders working
together,' said Mr Tom Jones, Citicorp's most senior financial officer. The
return on capital jumped to 22 per cent compared with 16 per cent a year
before.
The group's results were flattered by a lower effective tax rate, which at
34 per cent, down from 37 per cent, added around Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m)
to after-tax earnings. However even without this, Citicorp's profits beat
most forecasts, lifting its shares Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 44 during the
morning.
While most other US commercial banks face the prospect of slow growth in
domestic markets, Citicorp has benefitted from its large presence overseas,
particularly in consumer banking.
One result was that the bank's net interest margin - the average return it
makes on its assets - rose during the latest period, at a time when other US
banks are seeing margins fall. The net interest margin reached 4.37 per cent
in the third quarter, up from 3.97 per cent in the same period a year
before.
Overall, Citicorp said after-tax income jumped to Dollars 894m, or Dollars
1.67 a share, from Dollars 528m, or 97 cents a share, the year before.
Two factors underpinning this performance were a rebound in trading revenues
after a dismal first half of the year and a sharp fall in its loan loss
provisions. Trading income reached Dollars 287m, more than the Dollars 230m
of the first two quarters combined. The provision for bad debts fell from
Dollars 625m a year ago to Dollars 436m.
'This is the point of the credit cycle where we are at the low end (in terms
of provisions),' said Mr Jones.
He added that the bank remained wary about growth in its loans business.
Commercial lending was only 2 per cent higher than a year before, while
consumer loans were up 8 per cent.
Mr Carl Reichardt, chairman of Wells Fargo, the West Coast bank which also
reported earnings yesterday, echoed this caution. Net earnings at Wells
Fargo jumped 32 per cent.
Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan and Wells Fargo all exceeded market
expectations with third-quarter figures announced yesterday.

FT  19 OCT 94 / The declining rewards for accepting equity risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has become accepted that equities should provide a rate of return
substantially higher than on less risky alternatives such as bonds or
short-term money market instruments. Indeed, such an excess return is built
into pension fund costings and into many retail investment products. But is
the equity risk premium fading away? The very long-run picture for the UK is
set out each year in the Barclays de Zoete Wedd Equity-Gilt Study which
covers a period going back to 1919. This year's edition showed that the
excess return on UK equities compared with three-month Treasury Bills was
6.7 per cent annualised over this 75-year period. Roughly similar results
are obtained in the US.
During the 1980s equities continued to deliver in this prolific way, only
more so. The average equity return during the decade was 23.3 per cent a
year, against 12.1 per cent on Treasury Bills. British pension funds not
surprisingly ended the decade with large surpluses.
So far in the 1990s, however, equities have disappointed. The annual excess
return compared with cash has been only 1.6 per cent. Another BZW
publication, the Global Market Digest, shows that this pattern has been
repeated in many countries, with the excess annual return since the
beginning of 1990 being only 1.3 per cent in the US and actually negative in
Germany, France and Japan. For still strongly positive results you have to
go to Hong Kong and other Asian countries.
Of course, a run of a few bad years does not prove anything. The decade of
the 1970s was also a bad period for excess returns, but that was a period of
very high inflation and commodity price shocks. There is no such ready
explanation for the trend of the 1990s.
But the evidence is beginning to mount up. The persistence of such a high
equity risk premium has in any case been something of a puzzle. Although
individual equities are volatile, institutional investors can diversify, and
so long as they have reasonable time-horizons they may view equity
portfolios as being only moderately risky. They certainly do not require a
premium of 6 per cent or more.
So far this year, after all, equities in many countries have turned out to
be much less volatile than bonds - supposedly the safer investment. Long
gilts, for instance, are down about 18 per cent whereas the All-Share Index
is off by only 9 per cent. Wall Street has displayed minimal volatility for
the past two years.
The key may be in the historical composition of the long-run excess return
to equities. Much of it has come, in the past 10 years or so, from an upward
adjustment to the valuation basis. Investors are ready to accept a lower
equity risk premium on a forward-looking basis, but the process of
adjustment paradoxically generates temporarily higher returns. Eventually,
though, the revaluation process ends and future returns settle at a much
lower level: perhaps 1990 marked a turning-point here.
The theory gains some credence from the roughly coincident shift of equity
money towards emerging markets. The timing has owed much, of course, to
political developments, but there has apparently been a search for a more
attractive risk/return combination than that which can currently be found in
mature western markets.
For instance, cross-border investors channelled Dollars 61bn (Pounds 39bn)
into emerging markets in 1993 and, according to Baring Securities, at the
end of the year they held emerging market equities worth Dollars 200bn
against just Dollars 2bn in 1986. Even in less buoyant conditions, another
Dollars 40-Dollars 50bn of new money is likely to be transferred this year.
It is true that levels of underlying profit have recovered strongly in the
US and the UK, and are in process of doing so in continental Europe. Labour
is competing only weakly against capital for its share of the economic cake.
Dividends are growing quite rapidly.
But the return to equity investors in a secondary market depends crucially
on the initial valuation basis as well as on company profitability. Share
prices have moved to an historically high ratio to the book values of
underlying assets. It is hard, however, for investors to look forwards and
backwards at the same time.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Tagamet's US sales fall 76% in quarter: SmithKline Beecham's
new drugs offset loss of patent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US sales of Tagamet, once SmithKline Beecham's best-selling drug, collapsed
by 76 per cent in the third quarter to Pounds 31m after the expiry in May of
patent protection for the ulcer remedy.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive of the Anglo-US drugs group, admitted
yesterday that the fall was 'dramatic' but said it 'was not totally
unexpected'. He said sales declines after recent patent expiries at other
drugs companies had been comparable.
Third-quarter figures showed that Tagamet's weakness was partly offset by
new drugs, sales of which rose 83 per cent at constant exchange rates from
Pounds 124m to Pounds 226m. But SmithKline's claim that its shingles drug
Famvir, launched in the UK in January, had won a 30 per cent market share
was disputed by Wellcome, maker of market leader Zovirax. It said Famvir had
only 15 per cent of the market.
Total sales were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 1.59bn, from Pounds 1.46bn,
with trading profit up a similar amount at Pounds 301m, against Pounds 277m.
Pre-tax profits were 2 per cent down from Pounds 291m to Pounds 285m. The
1993 quarter included an exceptional Pounds 14m gain.
Earnings per share were 4 per cent higher at 7.8p helped by a sharp fall in
the estimated full-year tax charge, from 30.7 per cent to 27.9 per cent,
partly as a result of tax breaks arising from the Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds
1.5bn) acquisition of US distributor Diversified Pharmaceutical Services in
May. The quarterly dividend is 3p per London-quoted A share and 30.16 cents
per New York-quoted equity unit ADR.
Of the company's four business areas, pharmaceuticals grew the slowest. The
3 per cent rise in revenues came entirely from volume gains. Trading profit
fell 2 per cent as a result of the lower contribution from Tagamet.
SmithKline's biggest seller, the antibiotic Augmentin, saw sales rise 7 per
cent to Pounds 160m. The fastest growth came from the new anti-depressant
Seroxat, called Paxil in the US, whose sales more than doubled to Pounds
87m.
Animal health sales rose 10 per cent thanks to anti-infective treatments.
Consumer healthcare, which includes non-medical products such as the soft
drinks Ribena and Lucozade, had a 9 per cent increase in sales. Sales from
clinical laboratories rose 5 per cent in spite of a decline in average
prices.

FT  19 OCT 94 / ASH chief may scoop Pounds 1.67m pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tom Buffett could receive compensation totalling Pounds 1.67m after his
surprise decision to step down as chairman and chief executive of Automated
Security (Holdings).
Mr Buffett built ASH into a large electronic security systems group through
a series of acquisitions in the 1980s. Pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds
45.1m on turnover of Pounds 173.2m in 1992 but the group's financial
performance has been erratic and the shares have underperformed the FT-SE
All Share index by almost 80 per cent over the past five years.
The shares closed 5p lower at 83p yesterday.
In a statement to the Stock Exchange, ASH said Mr Buffett 'has agreed with
the board it is now appropriate that he should step down'. The company added
that Mr Buffett, 'now resides abroad and wishes to develop other
opportunities'.
Lord Lane of Horsell, who moves from deputy chairman to succeed Mr Buffett
as chairman, declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr Buffett's
departure, saying: 'I would not want to go beyond the statement.'
It is understood, however, that Mr Buffett has been spending an increasing
amount of time abroad, and that the board felt it was becoming increasingly
difficult for him to carry out fully his management activities.
Yesterday Lord Lane confirmed that Mr Buffett, whose remuneration totalled
Pounds 334,000 in the year to November 30, was on a five-year rolling
contract. He added that the issue of compensation was the subject of
negotiation and, 'is being sorted out by the lawyers'.
Mr Buffett was quoted as saying: 'It is with deep regret that I am leaving
ASH, but I believe that in the circumstances it was right for me to go.'
Following his departure, the company will be run by a management committee
chaired by Lord Lane. The committee will initially concentrate on 'refining
the strategic options now open to ASH', and will shortly begin the search
for a new chief executive.
ASH also announced pre-tax profits for the three months to August 3 of
Pounds 2.59m, up from Pounds 903,000 a year earlier. Turnover from
continuing operations increased by 10.1 per cent to Pounds 40.4m producing
earnings per share of 1.3p compared with a previous loss of 0.3p.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Chinese inflation rises to 27% as fears of social unrest
grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's annual inflation rate rose to 27.4 per cent in September, putting
more pressure on the central government which fears social unrest.
The government has already introduced price controls in an effort to break
the inflationary cycle. The September figure was up nearly two percentage
points on August, according to figures released yesterday by the State
Statistical Bureau.
The gloomy economic news underscores the difficulties faced by the
government, which admits it has entered a 'crucial' phase in its efforts to
curb inflation. The authorities need to maintain high levels of economic
growth or risk worsening unemployment and possible social unrest.
The bad September result seems certain to add to pressures on the leadership
to stiffen remedial action taken last month to restrain price increases. The
latest figures showed a further narrowing of the gap between the national
cost of living increase and that in the 35 biggest cities.
Until recently, urban inflation had been rising faster than the national
average. This suggests price curbs have been more effective in the cities
than in provincial towns and rural areas. Urban cost of living was up by
27.5 per cent in September, compared with the same month last year.
Western economists in Beijing view the inflation figures as an ominous
reminder to the authorities of their difficulties in curbing inflation.
'Whichever way you look at it, this is bad news for China,' one said. 'This
shows inflationary pressures in the economy are still quite strong.'
Mr Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the Statistical Bureau, blamed the
inflationary spiral on food price rises due to drought in northern China and
flooding in the south. He also said the effects of administrative price
rises for grain and other commodities were still being felt. The state
purchase price for grain has risen about 50 per cent in the past year.
Mr Qiu warned that China had entered a 'crucial' phase in the last quarter
of the year, with pressures increasing on the government to redouble its
efforts to bring price rises under control. He urged restraint on money
supply growth, increased curbs on capital spending, and increased
agricultural production.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Blair tackles Tories over split on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair used his first Commons appearance as Labour leader yesterday
to resurrect the option of a referendum on the next stage of EU integration.
Mr Blair, launching a fresh assault on Conservative divisions on Europe,
sought to extract some of the traditional heat from question time by
offering an unqualified endorsement of Mr John Major's Ulster policy.
In what aides described as a deliberate attempt to raise the tone of the
twice-weekly question time confrontation, he addressed the prime minister in
cautiously modulated tones, and restricted himself to two questions rather
than three.
Mr Major, who also dislikes the gladiatorial aspects of question time,
congratulated Mr Blair on his new job, prompting most observers to score the
first confrontation between the two leaders as a draw.
Mr Blair appeared to surprise Mr Major by challenging him to disown comments
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, ruling out a referendum on monetary
integration as 'a very strange way to run a modern industrial state'.
Mr Major said that the issue of a referendum 'does not arise and very
probably will not arise' because the agenda for the 1996 intergovernmental
conference of EU states had not been set.
Ridiculing Labour's pro-EU approach, he accused Mr Blair of seeking to form
a 'weak' government that would 'slavishly follow whatever Europe says'.
But Mr Blair told him: 'The chancellor takes one view on Europe, the
employment secretary (Mr Michael Portillo) takes another view, and you hover
between the two. A divided government is a weak government.'
Mr Blair gave no hint of a change in Labour policy on a referendum, which
mirrors the government's official view that no decision is necessary until
firm decisions have been made on whether to join a single European currency.
However, friends said he was considering promising a referendum in an
attempt to force Mr Major to endorse or reject demands for a vote by the
Tories' powerful Euro-sceptic wing.
Labour leaders are keenly aware that demands for a referendum caused Mr
Major anxiety when they were pressed by Conservative Euro-sceptics before
the European elections in May. A referendum is strongly opposed by Tory
pro-Europeans, who believe it would exacerbate party splits and lead to a
divisive campaign that could bring down the government.
Tory strategists believe a referendum is equally dangerous for Labour
because it could inflame the party's own Euro-sceptics.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Yeltsin in conflict with Russian prime minister: Economic
policies cause rift in leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A serious rift has opened up between Russia's president Boris Yeltsin and
his prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, whom he holds partly to blame
for the recent steep fall in the value of the rouble.
The two leaders differ over a range of economic policy issues. Mr
Chernomyrdin's continued absence from Moscow is a sign that he is regarded
with deep disfavour by President Yeltsin. Mr Chernomyrdin, who is still
officially on holiday at Sochi on the Black Sea, had been scheduled to
welcome the Queen in Moscow on Monday.
A report carried by independent radio and TV stations that Mr Chernomyrdin
had submitted his resignation was quickly denied by government spokesmen
yesterday. Mr Chernomyrdin himself told US vice-president Al Gore during a
scheduled phone conversation last night that the resignation rumours - which
had reached the White House - were untrue.
However, the prime minister was said to be preparing a statement to
journalists today.
A report by the Security Council - the standing commission which oversees
security matters - on the fall of the rouble was debated by the council
yesterday, but no formal announcement was made afterwards except that it
would continue its work for a further two weeks.
However the report is believed to put some of the blame for the rouble's
fall on the prime minister, as well as on Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman
of the central bank, and on Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister -
both of whom have resigned.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister for nationalities policy, said
yesterday: 'Any official who had a part to play in the rouble's fall has to
take responsibility for whatever area he has under his control.' He said
that the resignation of Mr Gerashchenko, a man with many allies in the
parliament, could 'create such a critical situation in which a discussion of
the budget in the duma (lower house) could have negative results for the
government'.
Mr Shakhrai, a close ally of Mr Chernomyrdin's in the past, said that he
believed that in spite of the blow it had received, 'the Chernomyrdin
government will remain in power'. He added, however, that an investigation
was continuing and that criminal charges might be brought.
The tension between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin has grown in recent
months, as the president sought to ease Mr Chernomyrdin's tight credit and
monetary policy.
Mr Yeltsin has in recent months pointedly preferred to consult Mr Oleg
Soskovets, first deputy prime minister, who accompanied him on his trip to
the US last month.
The Russian president yesterday named Ms Tatyana Paramonova, a former deputy
chairman in charge of budget and credit policy, as the central bank's acting
chairman.
Ms Paramonova has a high reputation for her tough views on the need for a
tight credit policy and for control of inflation. However, her relative
youth - she is 44 - and her sex, as well as her recent accession to a high
position in the bank, in 1992, has convinced most observers that she is a
temporary leader.

Mr Tom Buffett's five-year rolling contract at Automated Security Holdings
provides a good test for the whole 'roller' concept. This is a case of
manifest failure: ASH's share price has underperformed the market by 77 per
cent since the start of 1990. Defenders of rollers say they do not
necessarily reward failure as boards can insist on a reduced pay-off if
performance is poor. ASH now has the chance to show whether that is so.

FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese cars
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Production figures released by Toyota and Nissan yesterday suggest that the
Japanese automotive sector is still mired in deep structural and cyclical
difficulties. Nissan reported that domestic production in September fell
compared with the previous year - the 27th successive monthly decline.
Toyota, the stronger of the two companies, managed a modest 1 per cent
increase in exports, while Nissan's exports dropped by 5 per cent.
The domestic Japanese market is suffering from prolonged contraction:
vehicle output is set to be 10.6m this year, compared with a peak of 13.6m
in 1990. Abroad, the appreciation of the yen has hit Japanese manufacturers
hard, forcing up the price of Japanese cars. In Europe, for example,
Japanese car sales are set to fall 7 per cent this year despite a predicted
6 per cent growth in the market overall. In the US local manufacturers are
benefiting most from the upturn.
Japanese manufacturers have responded to the pressure by shifting production
out of Japan to lower cost manufacturing locations. Honda's announcement
this week that it plans to double its capacity in Thailand is the latest
example of this. In time, this strategy should restore the Japanese
industry's competitive position. But investors will find better recovery
stories among America's and Europe's motor companies.

FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a good run, the gilts market was looking for an excuse to consolidate
yesterday. The public sector borrowing requirement figures held no horrors
and the announcement that this month's gilts auction will be Pounds 2.5bn
hardly came as a shock, given that the Bank of England is giving November a
miss. Yet the morning's sharp correction could not be explained entirely by
renewed dollar weakness and profit-taking in German bunds.
Instead the finger was pointed at the Confederation of British Industry's
September retail sales survey and the much stronger than expected figures
for volume growth. Even analysts sceptical about the CBI survey's accuracy
were tempted to push up their forecasts for today's official numbers, some
dramatically so, and those looking for a reason to sell gilts could claim
they detected the whiff of returning inflation.
But the cries of wolf are increasingly falling on deaf ears and prices ended
well off their lows. Even if retail sales have picked up as the CBI figures
imply, the anecdotal evidence suggests the volume growth has not made it any
easier for retailers to push up their prices. Many City economists have now
come round to the Bank of England's more relaxed view on inflation. Yet
despite the recent rally, yields are still telling the old story and gilts
promise much if the governor is right.

FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Intel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel is impressive and aggressive. The group's lock on the global
microprocessor market allowed it to boost sales in the third quarter by 28
per cent compared with the previous year. Operating margins have slipped but
they were still a mouth-watering 34 per cent. Moreover, the decline is
partly due to Intel's diversification into lower-margin products such as
video-conferencing kit and partly because margins on 486 chips, which
account for the bulk of its production, have shrunk. As production of the
more advanced Pentium processors is increased, margin erosion should halt.
Fat margins are, of course, a temptation to rivals. It is in fending off the
competition that Intel has displayed its aggression. Not only has it pursued
Advanced Micro Devices mercilessly for alleged patent infringements, it has
embarked on a high-profile campaign to accelerate the industry's move from
486 to Pentium chips. In that way, it aims to keep ahead of its rivals. The
company's 'Intel inside' campaign has already resulted in a public spat with
Compaq, which does not wish to accelerate the change to Pentium-based
personal computers while its warehouses are full of 486 models. The risk is
that Intel will become so unpopular that customers desert it. But the
evidence so far is that, much as they may want to, they do not have the
option.

FT  19 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Invisible benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three drugs companies have collectively forked out Dollars 13bn on so-called
pharmacy benefit managers over the past 15 months. All three posted results
yesterday. Eli Lilly was understandably silent about its PCS acquisition
because the purchase is yet to be completed. More curious was that neither
Merck nor SmithKline Beecham provided anything to enlighten shareholders
whether their money had been wisely spent. Such information would have been
appropriate because the two rationales given at the time of the deals are
increasingly doubtful: that the drugs groups would gain market share by
pushing their drugs through the distributors; and that the distributors'
patient data would allow them to assess medicines' cost-effectiveness.
With hindsight it is clear there are less expensive ways of accessing such
patient data. Indeed, health maintenance organisations hold far more
complete treatment information than distributors and are quite willing to
share it for relatively small considerations. Meanwhile, the market share
argument is threatened by the Federal Trade Commission's concern that
prescribing policies which exclude other groups' drugs could be
anti-competitive. Perhaps the companies' silence was motivated by
embarrassment. The 1.5 percentage point increase in market share that Merck
is estimated to have achieved after its Medco acquisition seems scant reward
for a Dollars 6.6bn investment. The drugs industry's diversification into
distribution looks an expensive mistake.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Regional rivals pursue Japan: High fees and regulation are
taking their toll on Tokyo's financial market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the bullet train from Osaka rounds its final curve into Tokyo's central
station, a 60-foot-high neon map glows above the tracks, displaying the
world's latest trading news: from New York, London and Tokyo.
There could be no clearer icon of Tokyo's self-image as one of the three
great financial capitals. But as a picture of reality, the map is beginning
to look dated.
In the 1980s, few would have questioned Tokyo's membership of the exclusive
troika. Financial institutions flocked to the city, drawn by a vast pool of
investment capital and the liberalisation of its markets.
Four years ago, the bubble economy collapsed, ending the period of
spiralling asset prices in the late 1980s. But even then, the city remained
a leading capital centre.
However, the long malaise that has gripped Tokyo's financial markets in the
1990s has finally laid bare its fundamental uncompetitiveness. And in the
past year there has been a financial exodus from Japan's markets that has
left Tokyo well behind its two older global competitors and threatens its
position as the leading market in Asia.
The most tangible evidence of this is in the stock market. Last month,
British Gas became the latest company to announce that it would delist from
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In the past three years, foreign companies have
been signing off at the rate of one a month. In 1991, 127 foreign companies
were listed in Tokyo. The departure of British Gas has reduced the total to
93 - and many of those left are considering joining the queue for the exit.
Most companies blame high costs. The price of a Tokyo listing is three to
four times that in other leading markets, at Y15m to Y20m (Pounds 95,000 to
Pounds 127,000) a year. As the volume of trading has declined, scores of
foreign companies have come to regard that cost as unsupportable.
Worse for Tokyo, Japanese investors and companies have discovered the
attractions of other markets. The number of foreign purchases of Japanese
shares in Tokyo has dwindled since 1992, while the value of Japanese shares
traded in London has more than doubled. Even investors in Tokyo are choosing
to buy and sell Japanese shares in London. Last year, for example, London
accounted for nearly one-third of all the share trading in Matsushita, the
electronics manufacturer.
But the loss of equity trading to London pales beside what many bankers and
brokers in Tokyo regard as the main threat to its status: the shift from
Japan to the other big financial capitals in Asia. While turnover on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange has fallen by more than 25 per cent in three years,
trading has increased fivefold in Singapore and quadrupled in Hong Kong.
To buy shares in Tokyo, investors have to pay fees up to eight times higher
than in the world's other leading financial centres. Japan still imposes a
0.3 per cent levy on all share transactions, and brokerage commissions are
far higher.
In addition, Japan's regulatory environment has proved restrictive in some
areas, proscribing some activities and attaching mountains of paperwork to
others.
Companies hoping to list have to satisfy excessively tight capital and legal
requirements and pass an endurance test of time-consuming procedures.
Trading in derivatives, complex instruments whose value is based in part on
that of an underlying financial market, is primitive. Much of it is
proscribed by arcane anti-gambling legislation.
And bond issuance is legally and financially restricted. For years, the
Euromarkets have been more attractive for raising funds through bonds
denominated in yen. Moreover, there is an almost total absence of a
secondary bond market, where bonds can be traded.
In contrast, Singapore and Hong Kong have built on their reputation for
liberal regulatory frameworks, lower costs, less red tape, and a welcome for
business.
In derivatives, Japan has been left standing by Simex, the Singapore futures
exchange. This applies even in derivatives based on Japanese markets, such
as futures contracts for the Nikkei 225, the principal Japanese stock market
index.
Since 1991, the trading volume of Nikkei 225 futures contracts on the Osaka
Stock Exchange, Japan's main futures market, has declined from 1.75m
contracts a month to 440,000. In the same period, the Simex Nikkei 225
futures market, where trading costs are cheaper than in Osaka, has grown
from 60,000 trades a month to 405,000. Simex is expected to overtake Osaka
in volume later this year.
Expanding Asian companies looking to raise funds have also shunned Japan's
markets. In the past year, at least 10 Chinese businesses have chosen to
make their home at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange rather than in Tokyo,
despite the best efforts of the Japanese to lure them. And corporate bond
issuance in Japan by companies in Asia has grown by just 25 per cent in the
past three years, against a growth rate of several thousand per cent in Hong
Kong.
Tokyo's failure to attract this business has led many foreign investment
banks to cut their staff in Tokyo in the past year - in some cases to move
them to Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr Peter Brutsche, vice-president of UBS
Japan, the Tokyo arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, says urgent action is
needed: 'Time is now crucial. The Japanese administration needs to act fast
to stop the haemorrhage that plagues the financial industry.'
Such sentiments have at last begun to unnerve the authorities. In the past
few months, the Ministry of Finance's regulators have been alerted to the
dangers, not only by domestic and foreign investors, but also by some
bureaucrats in the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, who recognise the threat to Japan's international status.
As a result, some changes have been approved and derivatives trading will
become slightly easier later this year, although it will remain heavily
circumscribed. And yesterday the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced a relaxation
of some listing requirements for foreign companies.
These reforms, however, are limited and are proceeding at a painfully slow
pace. The foot-dragging is not simply an innate conservatism. It represents
a desire by the finance ministry to protect the interests of individual
sectors, such as banks and brokers - but it has the effect of stifling
Tokyo's markets.
Nevertheless, senior bureaucrats at the finance ministry argue there is
little solid evidence that Tokyo's position is under serious threat. They
concede it has lost ground to south-east Asian competitors, but point out
that the strong growth of the south-east Asian region in the past few years
has inevitably led to some shift in business.
Perhaps most importantly, the scale of Japan's savings and current account
surpluses means that the country is assured of a vast financial market. In
1993, Japan had the world's second largest government bond market and the
second biggest stock market capitalisation. It is the world's largest
capital importer and the biggest net capital exporter.
A finance ministry official argues this means there is no cause for alarm:
'We will continue to monitor the developments in Asian and other markets,
and if we need to act, then we will, but not by damaging the protection of
the investor.'
This sangfroid is not shared by many of Tokyo's financial community. In
increasingly complex and international capital markets, the size of the
domestic economy does not ensure the country's attractiveness as a financial
centre - funds could simply move offshore. Frankfurt is the financial heart
of an economy twice as large as any in Europe, yet it lags well behind
London in significance.
'Tokyo is in real danger of being left behind in the frantic race in Asia,'
says Mr Fumikage Nishi, of Nomura Securities. 'The only advantage it has is
scale. But that will be insufficient, because without real deregulation,
financial innovation in other Asian centres will rapidly outpace that in
Japan.'
A senior executive at an American investment bank goes further: 'In the end
it is not a question of kudos or status. It is about whether you have an
open financial market that distributes capital effectively.
'If Japan does not have that kind of market - and it does not have it now -
financial companies will go the same way as manufacturers: abroad.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Controlling state aids
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's powers to police government subsidies to industry
are unique among the world's competition authorities. However, Brussels
seems increasingly to be wielding a rubber stamp, not a truncheon. Last
week, it waved through a FFr11.1bn (Pounds 1.32bn) state bail-out of Bull,
France's nationalised computer maker, soon after blessing a FFr20bn rescue
of Air France.
Approval of these hand-outs is only the most visible sign of faltering
enforcement. EU state aids have grown sharply since 1990, because of
recession and subsidies by the German government to eastern Lander. But
though the Commission has stepped up monitoring, it turned down last year
barely 1 per cent of cases notified.
State aids are defensible if applied on a non-discriminatory basis for
socially beneficial objectives, such as research and development. But when
used to prop up lame ducks, support national champions or induce inward
investments, they threaten serious economic damage. They shelter recipients
from market disciplines, retard industrial adjustment and penalise efficient
producers. In short, they are disguised trade barriers which threaten to
fragment the single market.
The biggest flaw in existing EU controls is that they are too open to
political manipulation. Upholding competition is not always the first
priority of all commissioners involved in state aids decisions, above all
when it means offending the governments which appoint them. Such conflicts
of interest could be avoided by hiving off decisions to an independent
European cartel office. Germany favours that solution, but opposition from
other governments makes it unlikely to be adopted.
Steps can still be taken to strengthen enforcement. Making Commission
proceedings more transparent would increase pressures on governments to fall
into line. Brussels's criteria also need to be rationalised. Separate
guidelines for excess-capacity industries, such as steel and cars, make for
inconsistency, and are also sometimes overridden by competing regional
policy goals.
Still more anomalous is the treaty requirement that aids to state and
private companies be judged on the same basis. Not only does state ownership
make it nearly impossible to know whether aid is being granted on commercial
terms; by implicitly guaranteeing companies against bankruptcy, it
undermines competition. Brussels should have the right to insist on
privatisation as a condition for approving aid.
Yet state aids policy will remain an imperfect discipline, requiring
bureaucrats to second-guess decisions by private investors and managers. The
wisest policy is to minimise the need for intervention by strengthening the
market. It is no coincidence that many European industries where state aids
are common, such as airlines, steel, cars and textiles, are protected from
international competition. Closed markets maximise the distortionary impact
of subsidies; trade barriers only perpetuate governments' belief that funds
poured into inefficient companies can continue to earn a return.
True, removing trade protection might temporarily increase the incentive to
subsidise. In the longer term, however, the sustained pressure of
competition would do more to spur industrial rationalisation - and to make
apparent the true costs of subsidies - than any amount of policing by
Brussels.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Personal View: US healthcare - the issue that won't die
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM HAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Senator George Mitchell announced last month that he was ending his
drive to pass a healthcare reform bill through Congress, he invited the US
electorate to ask 'Who killed healthcare?' He hoped that voters in next
month's mid-term elections would punish the assassins, including Republicans
and other congressmen who have acted on behalf of the health industry
interest groups operating on Capitol Hill.
However, the senator should look at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue for
an answer to his question. The two people most responsible for the failure
of the bill are President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary. As a
presidential candidate, Clinton rode a tide of voter frustration with the US
healthcare system, winning widespread support for fundamental change. Once
in the White House, however, he had to make two fundamental choices on the
route to reform.
First, should the priority be a swift dash to universal health coverage or
measures to control costs? Second, should he put forward a detailed
blueprint of his own or set out some basic principles and challenge Congress
to fill in the details?
In drawing up legislative plans for universal coverage, the Clintons chose
the first option in both cases. The complexity of the resulting proposals
scuppered prospects for radical reform in 1994 by raising the opposition of
too many interest groups. Yet, despite this setback, healthcare reform will
return to the political agenda with the new Congress next year. Healthcare
is too important an issue to disappear.
Employee health insurance costs remain a problem for business. Some of the
largest employers have made progress in reducing their medical expenses, but
they are far from satisfied. Many smaller companies have yet to see
substantial benefits from attempts to drive down healthcare costs.
Local, state and federal governments must also give priority to bringing
medical costs under control. They are responsible for more than 40 per cent
of US health expenditure through Medicaid and Medicare, two publicly funded
schemes, and their own employees' health benefits.
Cost containment means giving further incentives to business to insure
employees through health maintenance organisations that have proved
successful in holding down costs. The health insurance market will attempt
to reduce administration costs through further mergers and alliances.
Medical litigation should also come under deep scrutiny from legislators.
There are few congressmen who do not accept that too great a burden is put
on doctors by lawsuits. While the legalistic culture of the US is likely to
make reform difficult, it needs to be tackled.
Savings in treatment costs would help keep the cost of health insurance down
and allow more employers to offer coverage to staff and reduce the number
who opt out of their employer's medical scheme on grounds of cost.
This incremental approach will, however, be insufficient for the liberal
wing of Congress, which hankers after much wider coverage. The failure of
the Clinton plan has probably taken universal coverage off the national
agenda for the next few years (although some states may attempt to pursue
it). An alternative may be to extend Medicaid benefits to selected groups,
such as pregnant women and children.
Many of these proposals have already been tabled in the present Congress by
the bipartisan 'Mainstream Group' in the Senate and in the Cooper/Grandy
proposal, which achieved cross-party support in the House of
Representatives. Had these groups been given a free hand and two years to
work on them, healthcare reform legislation might already have been signed.
They could not deliver largely because the healthcare debate had to wait
nine months while the Clinton administration produced its 1,300-page draft
plan. The plan proved so complex and divisive that another nine months
elapsed before serious negotiations on a politically practical draft could
begin. In the next Congress, representatives of both parties should be able
to pursue such an agenda without the heavy hand of the White House.
The irony is that the White House has won on healthcare. It is now too big
an issue to go away and the new Congress will have to take it on next year.
Reforms based on incentives to contain the cost of treatment and limited
steps to increase coverage may disappoint those who supported the Clintons'
more ambitious healthcare plans. But they could be the chief achievement of
the president's first term - even if he will get little credit for them in
the 1996 presidential contest.

<TEXT>
At 8.39 yesterday morning Charles Hochman, who retired as chief executive of
media-buying Aegis group on October 15, found himself the happy beneficiary
of 500,000 share options.
The happiness was short-lived. By 14.22 the options had vanished, cancelled
after Aegis was bombarded by City types saying that share options, after
all, were meant to motivate management, not cushion pensioners. 'It's all
highly eccentric,' said a City expert on corporate governance.
What was in the mind of Aegis' remuneration committee, which decides such
matters? The committee is composed of Frank Law, the (non-executive)
chairman; John Vogelstein of Warburg Pincus, a major shareholder; and Sir
Kit McMahon, a non-executive director.
By way of elucidation, Law said yesterday that Hochman's options 'were
automatically triggered by (Hochman's) service contract dating from 1992',
adding that the afternoon cancellation had Hochman's 'full agreement'.
Funnily enough, Aegis' latest annual report states that in February this
year Law was given 500,000 shares - as was his wife, who is not a director
nor even an employee of the company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vast amount of newsprint devoted to the German elections in the English
language press seems to have generated more heat than light.
No one, for instance, seems to be able to work out whether Helmut Kohl's
re-election is good or bad news for John Major's European policy. The
European editor of The Times, George Brock, writing on the Op Ed page, has
Kohl pushing 'European unification as hard as he can', while the leader on
the next page has him beginning to 'champion the decentralisation of power
away from the Commission'.
At least the ubiquitous Josef Joffe, editorial page editor of the
Suddeutsche Zeitung, who managed chunky pieces yesterday in both The
Independent and The International Herald Tribune, is saying pretty well
exactly the same thing in both organs.

Memo to Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade. Best keep an eye
on Michael Heron, chairman of Britain's Post Office.
As an ex-Unilever marketing man he has competed with the best and has been
given the job of exposing the Post Office to the winds of competition by
taking it into the private sector.
So what was he doing seemingly rubbishing market forces in a speech to the
25th anniversary dinner of the renamed Institute for Employment Studies?
Heron concluded that there was not much difference between the market and
the law of the jungle or the behaviour of baboons. It cannot solve most of
the fundamental problems facing society.
That sort of stuff might be music to the ears of a bunch of soft personnel
managers but it is not going to impress Her Majesty's Treasury.
Perhaps you need to be a bit more generous with the proposed share options
for Heron and his chums.

Once upon a time, possession of a dinner jacket meant certain death in
Russia, and the demand for 'smokings' has never really recovered. So the
invitation to political bigwigs to join the Queen at a reception at the
British Embassy on Monday caused a spot of embarrassment, seeing that the
dress code specified dinner jackets.
Hasty calls to the foreign ministry which keeps a stock of the things for
its diplomats' use. These proving insufficent in number however, a harrassed
official was forced to sound out the Moscow Light Opera Theatre, whose
performances regularly feature actors kitted out as waiters.
Its collection proved numerically suitable - only problem being that the

FT  19 OCT 94 / Observer: Passing the Lloyds' chair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Walker is not the first ex-Bank of England director to seek his
fortune in the City and will almost certainly not be the last. Yet his
decision to step down as a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank, when he was
widely thought to be the chairman in waiting, is puzzling.
True, the chairman of Morgan Stanley's European operations is likely to earn
several times the Pounds 223,000 that the chairman of Lloyds Bank got last
year. At 54, Sir David is still young enough to make some serious money
after a long career of public service. Even so he is turning down the chance
of leading Britain's most successful high street bank into the next century
in order to be the European figurehead of a Wall Street broker.
Whether or not Sir David sensed that the chairmanship of Lloyds was no
longer in his grasp, his departure raises the fascinating question of
whether Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, will be allowed to take
over as chairman from the elderly Sir Robin Ibbs who turns 70 in 1996 .
This would be a turn up for the books since Lloyds has never given the
chairman's job to one of its own managers before. But Sir Brian has
transformed the group and parallels could be drawn with Sir Edward Holden,
the banking 'superman' who turned Midland Bank into the biggest bank in the
world at the turn of the century, and was rewarded with the Midland chair.
Lloyds Bank could do a lot worse than promote one of the workers. These days
clearing bank chairmen don't have to be gentlemen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with Germany or other countries in central Europe, let alone those
of the third world, the UK does not have a refugee problem. The number of
asylum applications peaked in 1991 at 44,800, falling to 22,370 last year.
Yet the British Home Office finds it necessary to hold a growing number of
applicants - currently about 600 - in detention.
In a report published this week, and based on 50 cases selected at random,
Amnesty International found an average of nearly five months' detention
before release or expulsion. More than half those studied were detained for
over four months. Also, more than half spent at least part of their
detention in a criminal prison, in violation of international standards.
A separate study by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of
Torture deals with 47 detained asylum seekers examined by doctors from the
foundation since January 1993. All claimed to have suffered torture in their
own countries; all were found to be credible.
The most disturbing aspect of the system is that detainees are held without
charge. In the great majority of cases the initial decision to detain is
made by an immigration officer with only minimal training in asylum issues
and no specialist knowledge of the political situation in countries from
which refugees come. Yet there is no requirement, as there is for people
accused of crimes, that the detainee be brought before a court or
independent review body within a fixed period of time.
The government says that detainees are told the reasons for detention. Yet
many immigration officers seem to be unaware of this obligation. In any
event no written statement of reasons is given. Some detainees (but not all)
are eligible for bail. This, however, requires two persons willing to act as
sureties by pledging a substantial sum of money. Even then, there is no
presumption in favour of bail (as there is in criminal cases), and Home
Office lawyers usually oppose it.
The ostensible reason for subjecting a small proportion of asylum seekers to
this treatment is the fear that they would otherwise abscond. Yet seldom if
ever is any reason given why some are more likely to do this than others. In
22 of the cases followed by Amnesty the person was eventually released
before his/her case was resolved. Not one of these subsequently absconded.
No other EU country detains asylum seekers for such long periods, or without
judicial process. As well as being expensive for the British taxpayer, the
practice is contrary to international human rights law. The government
should act promptly to ensure that asylum seekers, not accused of any crime,
have at least the same rights as people who are.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Leading Article: N Korea on trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any assessment of North Korea's nuclear agreement with the US has to be
tentative while the fine print remains shrouded in obscurity. Yet the
outside world should start out by willing the accord to work.
It would be easy to dismiss the agreement on the grounds that it sets a poor
predecent to reward a country - with aid and recognition - after it so
wilfully flouted the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It could still be
years before North Korea is obliged to reveal the full extent of its nuclear
weapons development. Meanwhile Pyongyang could still perfect the manufacture
of bombs. In short, it seems in no way a reliable recipient of sensitive
western technology.
Such arguments will doubtless appeal to hawkish politicians, especially in
the US. But they must also consider the alternatives. No agreement of any
sort would be possible without some trust in North Korea's good faith.
There are certainly risks in the present approach. It is far from clear
whether North Korea will in practice agree to reopen bilateral talks with
South Korea on de-nuclearisation, or that it will agree to spot inspection
of its facilities. South Korea will have a long wait before it can feel
secure. Yet these risks are small compared with those of allowing the status
quo to continue. There would be little regional support for a policy of
confrontation, so economic sanctions would never stick.
The agreement has merit in giving the west leverage over Pyongyang.
Concessions are to be phased in as a reward for good behaviour, with the
establishment of a US liaison office in the North Korean capital - and the
de facto recognition which that implies - coming late in the process.
Meanwhile, North Korea will become increasingly dependent on the west,
needing oil imports during the switch to the new light-water technology and
access to imports of enriched uranium thereafter. That should encourage it
to open up its economy. Similarly, the fact that South Korea is to supply
the nuclear equipment, and probably a large chunk of the finance as well,
will give it influence in the North at a sensitive time of economic and
political transition. It is in everybody's interest that that transition
should be orderly.
By agreeing to the use of South Korean/US technology rather than that
supplied by Russia and Germany, North Korea has made a considerable
concession. This is perhaps the strongest indication of its desire to
conclude an agreement that sticks. If so, it is also a sign that Mr Kim
Jong-il, who seems formally about to take over North Korea's leadership, is
seeking some kind of rapprochement. It would be foolish now to drive his
country back into isolation.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Dying romance of the open road: The UK government's
disenchantment with the 'great car economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glorious, stirring sight] The poetry of motion] The real way to travel] The
only way to travel] Here today - in next week tomorrow] Villages skipped,
towns and cities jumped - always somebody else's horizon] O bliss] O
poop-poop] O my] O my]
Few have been so stirred by the romance of the open road as Mr Toad, the
hero of Kenneth Grahame's classic, The Wind in the Willows, on his first
sight of a motor car. But 90 years on from Mr Toad's fictional adventures,
this Elysian view of the car has dimmed as growing numbers of motorists take
to the road.
Official forecasts suggest that the number of cars on Britain's roads could
double by 2025. While the car remains a potent symbol of freedom, its
economic and environmental costs are being weighed more carefully by the
government.
This represents a change for the Conservative government. In 1979, Mrs
Margaret Thatcher, then the newly-elected prime minister, urged that nothing
should come in the way of 'the great car economy'.
Last week, Dr Brian Mawhinney, the new UK transport secretary, struck a
different note in his address to the Tory party conference. He caught the
headlines with a strong environmental attack on vehicle pollution,
announcing tougher exhaust standards and roadside tests designed to take the
worst polluting vehicles off the road. 'I aim to get rid of these belching
monsters once and for all,' he told delegates.
Signs that the environmental arguments are beginning to count for more in UK
transport policy have become apparent since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992
when the UK committed itself to producing a detailed environmental strategy.
A recent environment department discussion paper, Improving Air Quality,
identified the car as the number one source of pollution.
'In some areas of the UK, even where there is no significant industrial
activity, high levels of air pollution can occur,' the discussion paper
stated. 'In these areas, largely due to motor vehicle emissions, World
Health Organisation guidelines (on pollution levels) are often exceeded.'
The department concluded that the growing evidence of links between poor air
quality and serious medical conditions such as asthma, the incidence of
which is increasing particularly among children, demanded careful attention.
Further support for the environmental arguments against the car is expected
next week when the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution announces the
findings of a study into the environmental impact of Britain's traffic.
The 300-page report, the result of nearly two years' work by a 16-strong
team of scientists and environmental experts, will make some 100
recommendations on how to deal with transport problems.
There will be a strong emphasis in the report on tax measures to curb car
use, with a doubling of the price of petrol over the next 10 years singled
out as one desirable aim. The government is already committed to increasing
fuel duty by at least 5 per cent a year and is expected to raise it by
considerably more in the November Budget. The aim of the report, according
to Sir John Houghton, commission chairman, 'is not to clobber the car but to
give much more serious consideration to environmental factors'.
Air pollution is not the only environmental influence at work on transport
policy. The visual impact of roads in ancient towns and the countryside
gobbled up by tarmac have prompted a rethink.
Increasing environmental pressures were explicitly acknowledged last March
when the government dropped or froze a third of the road schemes planned for
the next 10 years after a review of the Pounds 23bn roads programme.
And pressure to reduce the roads programme further is likely to grow when
the government publishes a new study, by the Standing Advisory Committee on
Trunk Road Assessment, a government advisory body. This is believed to
conclude - against the transport department's usual assumption - that new
roads generate extra traffic and fuel congestion.
The new environmental emphasis in transport policy reflects the broadening
coalition against road-building. When the groups ranged against the
government's roads programme comprised environmental organisations such as
Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, they were dismissed as 'single issue'
lobbyists.
But increasingly, more establishment groups such as the Council for the
Protection of Rural England and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
have raised their voice against an unbridled expansion of road transport.
And Tory backbench MPs with constituencies threatened by new road-building
have added their voices to the cause. As many as 35 Conservative MPs hold
marginal seats that would be affected by proposed trunk road schemes,
according to Friends of the Earth.
Financial pressures, too, are coming to bear on the road programme as the
government seeks cuts in expenditure to reduce the public sector borrowing
requirement.
One consequence of this tighter financial regime is a rethink of the way
roads are financed. With the exception of a small number of bridges and
tunnels which charge tolls, driving on Britain's roads has been free at the
point of use.
By introducing tolls on motorways, the government would raise funds to
improve the network and make drivers reconsider the attractions of public
transport. The government is assessing proposals for a system of electronic
tolls and is also looking at 'congestion charging' - making motorists pay
for driving in towns. But it will be some years before tolling can produce a
new source of income for roads.
Meanwhile the relatively poor state of the public transport network makes it
harder to reduce dependence on the private car. Spending in the UK on rail
is among the lowest in Europe, at Dollars 8 per head of population compared
with Dollars 49 in France, according to a recent study by consultants Steer,
Davies &amp; Gleave. The government hopes to attract private finance to back
public transport projects, but so far with little success.
Environmental groups remain suspicious of the government's intentions. 'We
don't see any sense of urgency about questions such as traffic growth,' said
Ms Lynn Sloman, assistant director of Transport 2000, which lobbies for
public transport.
As for Dr Mawhinney's stirring speech at last week's party conference,
anti-road lobbyists point out that the roadside clampdown on polluters will
last just two months and involves no new money.
Dr Mawhinney says that there is no unanimity about what constitutes an
environmental transport policy.
For instance, many people in towns and villages bisected by a busy road want
a bypass but this worries environmental campaigners concerned at the loss of
open countryside. And forcing motorists to pay the full cost of transport
pollution and accidents - estimated at between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 20bn a
year - would severely damage the economy by putting up transport costs. It
would also disadvantage country dwellers who are more likely to vote
Conservative than those who live in cities.
Dr Mawhinney says his role is to balance the conflicting voices. But it is
clear that, for a mix of environmental and financial reasons, the balance of
argument has swung decisively towards the environmental lobby.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis of book market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BILL MCGRATH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing in response to Michael Goldman's comments (Letters,
October 17) regarding Dillons' market share. The information I quoted
related to six of the leading specialist bookselling chains (which are
closely comparable with Dillons). Information on sales from these chains is
consolidated by an independent company, Book Marketing, and reported to each
chain on a weekly basis.
The latest information from Book Marketing shows Dillons' share of these
chains has increased to 42.1 per cent. Book Marketing estimates that these
chains constitute roughly 30 per cent of the overall retail book market -
ie, excluding book clubs and institutional sales. The overall retail book
market, on the same basis, is estimated at roughly Pounds 1.3bn, which is
consistent with Dillons holding about 12 per cent of the retail book market.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: City advisers add vital dimension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C D COLLINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest that certain leading company acquisition teams
believe they 'can do everything a merchant bank can do' ('No Adviser the
magician's rival', October 11). Hanson has small teams in London, New York
and now Hong Kong and we also believe in doing as much work as possible
ourselves. However, our company's founders were probably as knowledgeable on
this subject as any in-house team, but never felt they could do without
their 'City advisers'.
You acknowledge that banks must be used for flotations and takeovers, but
there is another vital dimension - the generation of ideas. The City has an
array of talent and specialisation which no in-house team could hope to
match. Help from banks is particularly relevant for expansion in unfamiliar
geographical areas. As they are not charities, banks are not going to come
up with ideas unless they are going to produce business.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Muzak - an irritating and noisy
distraction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROBERT T STREET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read the article, 'Muzak to the ears' (October 13).
Personally, I will always walk out of any shop, restaurant or hotel which
uses so-called background music. I would also get off any aircraft doing the
same thing, if it were possible without doing myself serious damage.
The whole point is that one has no control over this form of pollution. One
cannot alter it, suppress it or, best of all, get rid of it entirely, except
by going elsewhere.
Whatever Muzak or its British equivalent is labelled, it is noise - and
noise which one cannot switch off is not only an irritant, but likely to
cause increased blood pressure, nervous exhaustion or worse in susceptible
people.
To the misguided managements of Mothercare, Harrods and other proponents of
this insidious form of pollution, I would ask - do people visit their stores
to hear music? No, they go there to view and perhaps buy. Why therefore
distract them?

FT  19 OCT 94 / The phoney war: A more active strategy to get rid of Saddam
Hussein is essential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kuwait crisis has already faded from the headlines. In retrospect the
crisis appears rather phoney. Almost certainly, Mr Saddam Hussein had no
intention of attacking Kuwait this time.
Yet the crisis was also real, because in this game 'almost' is not good
enough. A lot of people, after all, were almost certain he would not do it
in 1990. As a result, the US put out confusing messages, which he misread as
signs of weakness or indifference.
This time, if one judges by the Iraqi media, Mr Saddam had identified Mr
Bill Clinton as 'the hesitant president' on the basis of events in Somalia,
Korea and Haiti. Well, Mr Saddam is not alone in that. Probably his
objective was merely to stage a crisis, to which a 'diplomatic solution',
perhaps involving ex-president Jimmy Carter, would have to be found. But had
Mr Clinton not sent troops to Kuwait, Mr Saddam could well have taken it as
a sign that the US had no stomach for a second Gulf war, and forged ahead.
Now both sides are claiming victory. The US is apparently satisfied with the
passage of yet another United Nations Security Council resolution, requiring
Iraq not to deploy its troops in positions that enable it to threaten Kuwait
and warning of 'serious consequences' if it does. Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, believes this gives the US 'all the necessary authority
to act' against Mr Saddam if he threatens Kuwait again. But this
interpretation is contested by France and Russia. In Baghdad, official
spokesmen and even some western diplomats believe the crisis has
strengthened Iraq's position, by pushing the lifting of sanctions higher up
the international agenda and bringing Russia back into the argument on
Iraq's side.
Certainly the crisis revealed the existence of a broad coalition of
business, diplomatic and humanitarian lobbies in favour of easing or lifting
sanctions. These lobbies point out that Mr Saddam's removal (unlike that of
General Raoul Cedras in Haiti) has never been called for by any UN
resolution; and they argue that Iraq's compliance with the resolutions that
have been passed should be rewarded. This would supposedly relieve the
needless suffering of the Iraqi people, while allowing western companies to
win lucrative contracts and making it possible to build Iraq back into the
regional security order, as a bulwark against the alleged Iranian threat.
Yet in reality none of those objectives is likely to be realised while Mr
Saddam remains in power. His lack of concern for the suffering of ordinary
Iraqi people is amply attested. Food and medical supplies are not covered by
the sanctions, and Mr Saddam evidently has money he could spend on them if
he so chose. More money could be raised for that purpose by selling oil
under the terms of Security Council resolution 706, which specifically
provides for it. If he is allowed to sell oil and spend the money as he
likes, we can be sure he will have other priorities.
As for regional security, it is inconceivable that western or regional
powers will again make the mistake of building up Mr Saddam as a bulwark
against Iran. Even business opportunities would be limited by a continued
arms embargo, by memories of what happened to foreigners in Iraq during the
1990 Kuwait crisis, and by general uncertainty about the stability of a
regime so blatantly lacking any popular base, especially in the southern
oil-producing region.
In any case, it is now clearer than ever that the US will not agree to lift
sanctions so long as Mr Saddam remains in power. Yet at the same time there
is no guarantee that sanctions will remove him; and if they do he will not
go quietly. Even Gen Cedras agreed to step down only when US troops were
already on the way to force him out. Before that, he had done all he could
to prove that sanctions were hurting the innocent Haitian masses more than
they were hurting him.
Mr Saddam is doing the same, and he has other tricks up his sleeve. The
feint against Kuwait was one. The next could well be a new move against the
Kurds in the north, starting perhaps with the area south of the 36th
parallel which is not covered by the 'no fly zone', and hoping that Turkey
would refuse to authorise retaliation by western aircraft based on its soil.
The three-year-old US strategy of waiting for sanctions to work and reacting
to Mr Saddam's provocations as and when they happen is not good enough. A
more active strategy to get rid of him is essential, and should include some
or all of the following elements:
expanding the no-fly zone to cover all of Iraq, and excluding all armour and
heavy artillery from both north and south;
encouraging the opposition Iraqi National Congress to set up a provisional
government in the exclusion zones, with financial and military support from
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait;
stating explicitly that sanctions will be lifted only if Iraq accepts
Security Council resolution 688 (which correctly identifies Mr Saddam's
internal repression as a threat to international peace and security and
calls on him to stop it) and if UN human rights monitors are allowed
throughout the country as recommended by the UN special rapporteur;
lifting sanctions on areas controlled by the provisional government as soon
as it accepts these conditions;
setting up an international war crimes tribunal on the lines of that for
Yugoslavia, and indicting Mr Saddam.
Such a programme would remove the ambiguity about the purpose and target of
sanctions, and would make it clear, notably to the Iraqi armed forces, that
the country can be saved from anarchy only by hastening Mr Saddam's
downfall, not by delaying it.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nationwide sale shows lessons to be
learnt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TREVOR HARVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor's article ('Estate agents pay price of boom years',
October 13) gave members of the Nationwide Building Society useful
information about why their estate agents' offices, bought at an average
price of Pounds 400,000, were sold at a price of three for a pound and why,
as a result of the directors' judgment, their accumulated funds are now
Pounds 200m lower than they might otherwise have been.
While Nationwide's members are now informed, their power base is too diffuse
for the directors to be held accountable in any effective sense. As a result
of directors' decisions, Nationwide's balance sheet is arguably at least
Pounds 200m weaker than it might otherwise have been. How are Nationwide's
directors to be held accountable? The traditional reply of the proponents of
the status quo is to point to the power of members to remove the retiring
directors at the next annual general meeting.
The reality of life is that 97.5 per cent of Nationwide's members chose at
the last AGM to act like pure consumers rather than members of a mutual
organisation. They neither voted in the election of directors nor attended
the AGM. Directors of building societies generally operate in an
accountability vacuum and it is not really their fault. If members have
given up on mutuality as an effective form of corporate governance, that
needs to be recognised.
Selling for a pound what has cost Pounds 200m of somebody else's money to
acquire is not very clever. What is even less clever is that the somebody
else in question will not be bothered to do anything about it. The
Treasury's review of current building society legislation, particularly in
relation to the accountability of boards to members, will need to recognise
the world as it really is if corporate governance within societies is to
change and become effective.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Coal contracts too short term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER VINCENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Smith ('Private bidders' dash for coal', October 13) rightly
points out how critical the future market for coal will be to the success of
the preferred bidders.
By its very nature, coalmining needs long-term investment if it is to
thrive. But investors expect a degree of certainty and, looking ahead, we
see precious little of it.
RJB Mining is effectively set to take over the remaining English coal
fields, and with them the bulk of contracts to supply power generators. But
what will happen when these five-year contracts expire in 1998? In our view,
10 or 15-year contracts are needed and unless these can be negotiated it is
difficult to see there being any incentive for RJB Mining to put in the
long-term investment the industry needs.
Without the certainty of such contracts, we fear there may be a temptation
to focus on immediate high value production at the expense of assets which
need longer-term investment in order to be realised. This may be profitable
in the short term, but is it really the best way of meeting the country's
future energy needs?

Sir, As usual, you exaggerate the excellence of French Prime Minister

The unfortunate Mr Balladur actually says 'Right, I'll call a register to

FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: A Romanian 'Nabucco' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worried that a visit to that new production at Covent Garden might turn out
to be a nasty post-modern surprise? Just a short tube ride away on Monday
one could see opera being performed as it used to be, most appropriately in
London's museum quarter at South Kensington.
For a single night the Romanian National Opera was in town. With three
operas in hand, the company is at present touring Britain on what is an
ambitious itinerary given the costs involved in taking an orchestra, chorus
and soloists overseas. Audiences are said to have been disappointing in some
venues but there were no worries in London: a well-filled Royal Albert Hall
greeted their rare staged performance in Britain of Verdi's Nabucco.
Like other countries in eastern Europe, Romania has opera productions that
are so old-fashioned as almost to be authentically 'period'. It is safe to
say that Nabucco in Verdi's day would have looked more like this dusty
offering from the Old Testament than one of our fashionably updated
productions set in the present-day Middle East against a background of
armoured tanks and oil wells.
There is nothing like a bit of cheap spectacle. Colour-coordinated costumes
(ruby red for bloodthirsty soldiers, green for homesick prisoners) ensure
that every crowd scene will be a gaudy feast for the eye. Final tableaux are
a speciality: soloists and chorus are happy to stand stock-still singing
away for hours, but in the closing minutes of each act everybody will make a
dash to take up their positions. Some dancing helps, too. Few generals are
as fortunate as this Nabucco, who arrived with an army of comely dancing
girls, each clad in little more than a body stocking and a
strategically-placed big red tassel.
Altogether, it was a bit of a hoot, but in the Royal Albert Hall it will at
least have come across as a visually bright production. The Romanian chorus
and orchestra are on an average level with small equivalent companies in
western Europe and the performance seemed well enough prepared, though the
conductor Cornel Trailescu might have brought more intensity to the high
points of the drama.
For export, Romania's main hope is likely to be its singers. This cast
included a moving Zaccaria in Pompei Harasteanu and a tenor with some
inelegant heft for Ismaele in Mihai Munteanu. Nicolae Urdareanu (the one
with the big putty nose) had enough voice for Nabucco, but proved shaky on
style and intonation when required to sing a lyrical line. Melania Ghioalda
sounded confident about tackling Abigaille, although she lacked vocal claws
in this tigress of a role. Most impressive was the mezzo of Ecaterina Tutu:
the role of Fenena did not give her much to sing, but we shall no doubt hear
more of her in the future.
Tour concludes in Canterbury, October 18-22

FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: Resurrections - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-publicity for Resurrections has marketed its author 'Biyi Bandele-Thomas
astutely, as a man who gave up the lucrative job of running an illegal
gambling operation in Nigeria at the age of 16 to go to university and
become a writer. It was an art-conquered-all story tailor-made for the
broadsheets, the perfect hype. However, cynicism of this kind is dashed on
encountering his work. Bandele-Thomas is an astounding story teller, in both
senses of the phrase.
He is a teller of astounding stories. The world of Resurrections is an an
exaggerated vision of contemporary Nigeria, in which a drug baron (who
clothes himself in euphemism, insisting that he is an enterprising
businessman who has spotted a gap in the market for 'commodities') can use
both senior contacts in the corrupt military government and simple bribery
to sue for his acquittal on a capital charge. Negotiations between his
counsel and the judge are conducted in a haze of poetic circumlocution,
where the very writing desk is alive, resting on the head of mute menial.
One of the characters describes the story he himself inhabits as 'Kafka on
speed', which isn't too far from the truth.
Here, too, the dead routinely return to the living to offer advice, smooth
their journey into the next world or even to re-write history. These ghosts
carry no air of the extraordinary about them, but are simply an integral
part of the fabric of things. Bandele-Thomas has fashioned a potent West
African counterpart to the creations of the Latin-American realists.
He is also an astounding teller of stories. The impulse to weave tales seems
stronger than the desire to ensure that their fabric is smooth: he possesses
a marvellous ear for individual phrases, and an enviably fertile imagination
through which his narratives twine, but as the play progresses from one
episode to the next there is often a palpable clunk as his dramatic
locomotive crosses the points.
So compulsive is this urge that on the conclusion of the main story he
cannot resist the temptation to keep the tale going; he tacks on an even
more fantastic coda in which his characters return in different guises. Yet
the mark of a true storyteller is that the listeners want above all to know
what happens next, or how it happens.
In Yvonne Brewster's direction it happens with startling visual opulence.
The judge's throne is periodically flown up to hover above the rest of the
action; chilling, vulture-headed, stilt-walking figures stalk the
proceedings when the smell of death hangs in the air; more ridiculously, a
ghost arrives on the stage on a bicycle.
Ben Thomas as Bubba BB has all the implausible dignity of a Charlton Heston;
his underling Santana - the storyteller within the play - is, in Colin
McFarlane's performance, a beguiling mixture of inarticulate deference
toward BB and confident fabulation toward the audience. A less fantastic
show would be stolen by Don Warrington's Judge Bassy, the worm who finally
turns.
Bandele-Thomas's Two Horsemen transfers from the Gate to the Bush next
month, and his Bad Boys is to be screened by the BBC; stories keep spilling
from him, and judging by Resurrections, outpourings from his well-spring are
both flavoursome and refreshing.
At the Cochrane Theatre until November 29 (071 242 7040)

FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: News on a heartstring - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The move towards soft-centred 'human interest' journalism on television is
unmistakable and yet the fear, expressed in this column as anxiously as
anywhere, that such material would drive out tough, investigative
journalism, especially on ITV, has, so far, proved empty. Indeed, if there
is any ground left for such qualms it would seem to exist at the BBC more
than ITV. True, the realisation that you could exploit 'sexy' stories (which
do not have to have anything to do with sex, the word being used in
television to mean a cross between appealing and trendy) to attract big
audiences in peak time at costs well below those for popular drama or other
entertainment, happened to coincide in Britain with the demolition and
reconstruction of ITV. The need for the new companies to make huge sums of
money to pay for the government's dreadful franchise auction and Treasury
levy in addition to dividends, and at the same time satisfy the demands of
the Independent Television Commission not to banish all current affairs to
the periphery, led to the prompt import of 'infotainment' models from the
US. But the BBC was not slow to follow suit; in fact it could be argued that
today the BBC sets the pace.
Consider the schedules for tomorrow evening. At 8.00 BBC1 begins another
batch of Children's Hospital, a series which typifies the fashionable
approach, being concerned with individual heartstring-tugging stories.
Medicine is a - if not the - major catchment area for infotainment, and
children, like animals, are a better bet than adults, being more helpless,
more appealing, and less likely to die. At 8.30 ITV screens Blues And Twos,
one of several series which literally chase ambulances, in the hope that the
cameras will come across a really nasty accident. At 10.00 we are promised
that Inside Story on BBC1 will 'lift the lid off cosmetic surgery'. And at
11.05 Channel 4 offers Prostitute in which, we are told, we can meet
Monique, mother of seven, who took up prostitution when her lover got into
debt, and Agnes who treats the business as an office job. There can surely
be no argument that there is far more material of this sort on British
television today than there used to be, nor any denying that it represents a
shift towards the tabloid.
However, on Monday last week, at 8.30, bang in the middle of peak time, ITV
provided a classic World In Action report on a 30-year experiment in Britain
to inject 2,000 slow-growing children with a hormone extracted from
pituitary glands collected from bodies in hospital mortuaries. If it sounds
like the plot from a Hammer movie, the outcome was not so very different:
though the children did grow faster, they then began to die of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disorder, the human version of 'Mad Cow Disease'. Perhaps
this story has already been widely publicised in the medical press or even
in consumer magazines or newspapers, but I had certainly not come across it.
WIA investigated the way in which the pituitaries were collected, often by
mortuary attendants who were paid 12 1/2 p a gland, keeping the parts in a
cupboard or on a window ledge until they had enough to send off.
It may be asked 'How is this so very different from those other 'soft
centred' medical series?' The answer is that although WIA did interview
individual sufferers, the programme's chief concern was to reveal the
classically British manner in which the whole business has been kept under
wraps. One patient said they had been 'treated like morons' with doctors and
civil servants being evasive and telling those affected as little as
possible. Another said, with admirable moderation, 'I think the whole thing
has been very shabbily handled'. It was an appalling story, and yet
heartening to find television using its weight and influence in a classic
piece of journalistic investigation.
The next day brought an edition of Network First, again on ITV, this time at
10.40 (surely not so terribly late for anyone really interested) called 'The
Secrets Of Porton Down' which produced even more important revelations. The
programme showed how claims that Britain gave up 'offensive' research to
stick to the 'defensive' type in the 1950s are, at best, disingenuous. It
also showed how servicemen have, over many years, been lured to the centre
for chemical and biological warfare research at Porton Down as guinea pigs.
The word 'lured' may seem loaded if you have not seen the commercial, shown
on this programme, which was used to induce men to volunteer, a commercial
which made Porton Down look, quite literally, like a holiday camp with the
special attraction of topless women. The programme showed how at least one
man died (his inquest was kept secret) and - via personal witness - how
others have suffered. Asked why there had been no systematic follow-up to
check the after effects of these experiments, the head of Porton Down said
there was no evidence of any need for such work . . . but how could there be
without any follow up?
Programmes of this sort send tendrils of fear curling around your heart as
you realise how frighteningly easy it is for even democratic governments to
mislead their electors, or simply to lie by omission. How many of us
realised that our governments used our money at the Nancekuke biological and
chemical warfare centre in Cornwall to extend work on nerve gases begun in
Nazi concentration camps? Perhaps we would approve, but how can we decide
unless we know what is going on? And is the job of telling us not more
important than keeping us up to date on French prostitutes?
Thursday brought yet another revealing programme, this time on Channel 4
where Critical Eye presented 'Quick War, Slow Death'. Here was yet another
example of the passion among British authorities for keeping the citizen in
the dark, wheeling out the Official Secrets Act at every opportunity,
ensuring that victims of a single problem cannot make common cause, and
withholding fundamental human rights by denying the British a freedom of
information act. This programme left you in no doubt, first, that a number
of those involved in the Gulf War now suffer some form of long-term illness
(the Americans admitted it long ago) and, second, that British military and
government authorities will go to startling and embarrassing lengths to
avoid any admission of involvement.
Three programmes in one week may not be hugely significant, but they do seem
to give the lie to my previous suggestions that the disappearance of such
series as This Week and First Tuesday could mean a new ITV with no
journalistic teeth. On the contrary, however unhealthy the relationship
between government and franchise winners, ITV currently looks like much the
most fierce champion in British television of the public right to know. And
that, surely, makes up for an awful lot of ambulance chasing and cooing over
little children.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: Pink Floyd - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pink Floyd are the best of pop - and the worst. Currently filling Earl's
Court for an unprecedented 14 nights, they are a mass of contradictions.
The songs evoke a druggy dreamworld of hippie indolence a generation old,
yet are programmed with a computerised precision that Captain Kirk would
admire. The lyrics are often heavy with revolutionary fervour yet the band,
or rather the three that survive, enjoy all the privileges of the ultra
rich. The music encourages you to close your eyes and trip, yet everyone at
the concert is tense and alert for the next mind-blowing explosion of
techno-trickery.
The Floyd long ago realised that their music was irredeemably archaic and
that to survive they must become showmen. Lacking personalities, they sold
their souls to the backroom boys: you leave the concert singing the special
effects rather than the tracks from the new album, The Division Bell.
As you wait for the band to appear you are titillated with bird song and a
tolling tocsin; then comes the dry ice and the brilliant blinding spotlights
and green, red and yellow laser beams. It is like being bombarded with
innocuous friendly fire.
To help keep you awake during the many songs that meander into banality, a
giant tambourine-shaped screen offers helpful images of spliff-toting
beatniks, Cambridge colleges, and flying bedsteads, which just fail to make
sense but are very decorative.
When the music lapses into especially monotonous doodling you know the Floyd
have a cracker up their sleeves. Look out for the model aircraft screeching
across the Arena to explode near the stage; and there go the flares, pumping
fire into the air again and again while the Floyd's motifs, giant
polystyrene pigs, poke their heads above the stage, eyes piercing the
audience.
Occasionally the adrenalin shot comes from the music, from 'The Wall', in
which the three ululating girl backing singers break into brutal cockney,
and an abusively sneering 'Hey Teacher' breaks out in lights at the front of
the stage. It all comes right near the end, too, when, against images of
world leaders slipping and sliding, grinning and fibbing and generally
making fools of themselves, Pink Floyd play their 20-year-old classic, 'Dark
side of the moon'.
What holds the show together is Dave Gilmour, the guitarist, who stands
centre stage and bravely despatches guitar licks back through the decades.
Like Rick Wright on keyboards and Nick Mason on drums, Gilmour has a
doppleganger, a shadowy fellow musician who discreetly earns his fee, and
pumps out the sound to pomp mark 10. Despite the millions invested in the
hardware at least the Floyd are professional enough to turn up.
The Floyd's success drives the critics mad: there must be something wrong
when fans fawn on 50-year-olds pumping out music unchanged since 1970. What
is wrong is current pop. It is a safe bet that in a century's time audiences
will sit in respectfiul approval at re-creations of Pink Floyd concerts.
There are very few other bands assured of such prospective immortality.

Having been knocked off my motorbike a few months ago, with consequent
broken ribs and a damaged leg, I shall watch Dispatches with particular
interest (9.00 C4). We are promised examples of the increasingly
questionable methods used by insurance companies in their determination to
avoid paying damages. It seems that private detectives posed as market
researchers, for instance, and tried to get Lynn MacDonald to undertake
cleaning work incompatible with her medical condition so that they could
secretly film her doing it. Lovely people. Highlight of the evening is the
return of Between The Lines, the most impressive police series to have
appeared in the past 10 years (9.30 BBC1). Bravely the producers have
decided to take a major sideways jump in the plot, moving Clark not only out
of the internal investigation bureau but right out of the Met. He finds
himself working undercover for the Sun. The opening programme in C4's
Counter Culture (the title is a pun) was about a tea and coffee merchant.
Today's shop is the one in Newcastle United's stadium (9.45).

FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Backing for food process -
Irradiation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Health Organisation has given strong backing to the controversial
technique of food irradiation.
It concludes in a study* that there is no evidence of any extra health risk
associated with the process and the health benefits could be substantial.
'As long as requirements for good manufacturing practice are implemented,
food irradiation is safe and effective,' the study says.
Food irradiation involves bombarding products such as spices, meat, poultry
and potatoes with ionising rays or electrons. This destroys insects and
bacteria, making the food safer to eat and delaying spoilage.
The WHO effectively scotches most consumer concerns about eating
'irradiated' food. Food irradiation does not increase the incidence of toxic
radiolytic chemical substances. It does not generate 'measurable' additional
radioactivity, and it is not capable of producing mutant bacteria or
viruses.
Nor does food irradiation destroy nutrients more than any other processing.
Compared with the loss of nutrients through cooking the loss through food
irradiation 'is really minimal', says Gerald Moy of the WHO's Food Safety
Unit.
Food irradiation holds the promise of big health gains, the WHO believes. In
developing countries, up to 70 per cent of diarrhoeal diseases, which cause
about a quarter of all deaths, are thought to be food transmitted.
In the US, there are between 24m and 82m cases of food-borne disease every
year, with some 10,000 deaths. An outbreak last year of illness caused by
undercooked hamburgers killed four children and put nearly 200 people in
hospital. *Safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated food. Distribution
and Sales Service, WHO, Geneva, ISBN 92 4 156162 9.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: From negative to positive -
Prices in Europe have recovered sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market for waste paper in Europe has turned around in recent months,
making it worthwhile for many countries to recycle material for the first
time in years.
Some grades of waste paper and board were even priced negatively at the
beginning of the year - the authorities would pay processors to take it away
 -but have shot up in value as shortages have appeared across the continent.
'Although it looks like a vast increase in waste paper prices, we are
actually just getting back to the level we saw in 1989 before we were hit by
the recession,' says Geoffrey Jones, national secretary at the British Waste
Paper Association.
A waste paper index of UK prices, which sets 1990 as 100, has shot up from
59 at the beginning of the year to 122 in August as consumption has
increased by 8 per cent. Prices in continental Europe have risen even faster
with increases for many grades of between 70 per cent and 100 per cent.
'We have gone from huge surpluses to huge shortages,' said Gerry West, sales
director of Severnside Waste Paper in Cardiff, which is part of the St Regis
group.
Although shortages have eased slightly in the past couple of months, West
points to the low levels of stock carried by European paper mills as a
measure of tight supplies. He reckons that stocks in the UK were generally
at 80,000 tonnes in mid-September compared with the usual 150,000 tonnes.
Waste paper prices are to a large extent following the dramatic increases in
the virgin pulp market. At the same time, demand from Asian importers has
sucked waste paper out of Europe.
German waste collectors are also not exporting so much to other European
markets and concentrating on developing processing capacity at home.
'In the past couple of years, German recycling laws had encouraged the
collection of large amounts of old paper and the country had little capacity
to handle it,' says Benedict Southworth, campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
'So it was virtually given away on the European market, forcing down
prices,' he adds.
The rise in the waste paper market is leading to a hike in newsprint prices
as mills seek to recoup raw materials costs.
October increases are expected to push the UK market between 7 per cent and
8 per cent higher. West expects the price rises to prompt higher recycling
rates in many European countries. For example, recovery rates in Italy and
Spain were very low as processors found it cheaper to buy German material.
In the UK a new newsprint mill in Aylesford, Kent, will be opened next year
with expected demand for an additional 400,000 tonnes of old newspapers a
year. Britain consumes 12m tonnes of paper and board products a year. But it
collects only 3.5m tonnes of material for recycling. 'Even with a
conservative recovery rate of 50 per cent, we ought to be recycling 6m
tonnes a year, so there is a lot to go at,' says West.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Recyclers on a paper chase -
Old newspapers and card have suddenly become a scarce and expensive
commodity / Implications for US waste recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of North America's biggest newsprint producers, Vancouver-based Fletcher
Challenge Canada and Jefferson Smurfit of St Louis, Missouri, broke with
tradition in August when they announced their third price hike of the year.
In addition to the usual across-the-board increase (in fact, a cut in
discounts), the two companies said they would slap a Dollars 27.50 (Pounds
17.50) per tonne surcharge on all newsprint made from recycled paper. The
move reflects a dramatic turnround in the North American market for used
newspapers, stationery and cardboard boxes. From being a cheap and readily
available alternative to wood pulp (the natural raw material used in
paper-making), waste paper has suddenly become a scarce and expensive
commodity.
The price of old newspapers (ONP) has almost quadrupled from a low of about
Dollars 30 per tonne a year ago to Dollars 110/tonne. Old corrugated
cardboard (OCC) prices shot up from Dollars 45 to Dollars 210 per tonne
earlier this year, but have since eased to about Dollars 80-Dollars 120,
depending on region.
The paper shortage comes just as North American forest-products companies
are in the middle of massive investments in paper de-inking and recycling
facilities.
According to the American Forest and Paper Association in Washington DC, 56
recycling projects are currently on the drawing board in the US. The
industry is expected to spend about Dollars 10bn on new recycling capacity
over the rest of the decade.
By 1996, the US paper and paperboard industry is expected to rely on
recovered paper for 35 per cent of its fibre supply, against 42 per cent
from primary wood pulp. (The rest comes from residues, such as sawmill
waste.)
The present shortages reinforce fears that de-inking and recycling plants
could struggle to acquire sufficient quantity and quality of old paper. 'We
need to collect more, especially in the office-waste side,' says Jon Ashley,
manager of fibre procurement at International Paper, the world's biggest
paper producer.
Mark Roseborough, general manager of Newstech Recycling, a waste-paper
processing company in Vancouver, notes that 'we're competing against virgin
pulp. There's a choice to be made.'
Publishers' enthusiasm for an ever-higher recycled content in newspapers and
magazines could wane if used-paper costs keep climbing. Some US state laws
exempt publishers from recycled-content targets if the price of newsprint
made from recycled material rises above that made from virgin fibre.
Fletcher and Jefferson Smurfit abandoned their plan for a two-tier price
structure after other producers failed to follow their lead. Some feared
resistance from publishers, whose newsprint costs have already jumped by
about 15 per cent this year. Others, protected by long-term contracts, have
yet to feel the full impact of the jump in recycled paper costs. But Mark
Gibson, Fletcher's vice-president for paper marketing, predicts that the
surcharge 'remains a very real possibility in the future'.
According to Gibson, Fletcher now pays more for de-inked, recycled pulp than
for virgin fibre: 'Most people assume that because it's old newspapers, it
must be cheap, but they're wrong.'
The used-paper shortage partly reflects rising domestic and foreign demand
as overall business activity picks up. US waste-paper exports, mostly to the
far east, rose by about 34 per cent in the first six months of this year.
Soaring wood-pulp prices, which have jumped from Dollars 390 to Dollars 700
a tonne in the past year, have encouraged papermakers to turn to used paper
as a raw material.
But the shortage has been exacerbated by the rising threshold imposed by US
and Canadian authorities on the minimum recycled content of packaging,
newspapers and other paper products.
The Clinton administration decreed last year that all paper ordered by the
US federal government must have a recycled content of at least 20 per cent.
In California, the rule is that one-quarter of state purchases must have a
minimum 40 per cent recycled content.
North American recycling targets are well below those in some European
countries, especially Germany. But US and Canadian paper mills also have to
fight harder to lay their hands on suitable used paper.
One sore point is the sizeable quantities of waste paper being directed to
energy-from-waste plants. According to some estimates, as much as 10 per
cent of paper that might normally go to landfills or recycling plants is
being channelled into energy production.
The terms of bond issues floated to finance energy-from-waste plants
frequently require municipalities to control the flow of combustible
materials. Municipalities are also eager to collect recyclable materials to
help raise money for their waste-management services.
'Any time you interfere with the free flow of our fibre source, you're going
to be creating some problems,' says Virgil Horton, vice-president of the
AFPA's paper group.
The paper companies want free-market forces rather than municipal ordinances
to decide what happens to used paper. A growing number of producers have
moved into waste-paper collection as a means of securing their raw material
supplies. Some industry experts are confident that the shortage of old paper
will subside. 'Recovery rates are still nowhere near what is attainable,'
says an executive at one Canadian company.
Paper companies have become increasingly active in recycling programmes.
International Paper, for instance, was involved in a milk-carton recycling
drive in Los Angeles. The AFPA has set up task forces to try to ease
bottlenecks in supply.
Papermakers are also encouraged by a rapid consolidation of the North
American waste industry. Big waste services operators, such as Waste
Management, Browning-Ferris and Laidlaw, have the resources to improve
collection and invest in extra recycling capacity.
Even if waste-paper prices stay high, recycling fans can take heart that
prices of virgin fibre are unlikely to drop much in coming years. The North
American forest industry's concern about waste-paper prices is matched by
fears that stricter rules to protect old forests in British Columbia and
rare species in the north-west US, are also making trees a scarce and
expensive commodity.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Easy guide to degrees of employment - Which
universities are the most successful at preparing their students for work?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anybody thinking of going to university with the aim of getting a job at the
end of it might be interested in the league table published here.
It rates UK universities (those established before all the polytechnics were
given the same status) according to the success of their first-degree
graduates in finding a job after leaving. The table covers those graduates
who attended degree courses over the three academic years from 1990-91 to
1992-93.
The table is compiled from the 1994 edition of University Management
Statistics and Performance Indicators in the UK.
One reason for a variation in performance is the difference in subject mix
because some subjects may be more useful vocationally than others, some are
a prerequisite for certain types of employment - in medicine for example -
and some may be simply more attractive to employers.
The compilers attempt to take account of this, calculating the number of
graduates unemployed or in short-term employment that would be expected if,
in each subject, it conformed to the national distribution.
The actual number of graduates without jobs or in short-term work is
subtracted from the predicted figure and then expressed as a rate of excess
per 100 graduates. A negative number, therefore, gives a higher than
predicted number of unemployed graduates or those in short-term work while a
positive figure reflects fewer unemployed than might be expected.
Regular readers of the column will note that the percentages vary in degree
from those published last year. That is because last year's table used a
slightly different calculation. The order would be the same, however, with
either calculation.
While there are many variables involved in assessing a university, the
league table does appear to be a good indicator of students' employability
at the end of the course. As the notes to the research point out: 'The First
Destination Record remains the principal source of information about
graduates' destinations.'
One factor in the placings not taken into account by the calculations is the
provision of sandwich courses where students get work experience with an
employer. This may account, in part at least, for the high placing of Brunel
University, for example, which offers a larger proportion of sandwich
courses than any other university.
The importance of course choice for job finding is highlighted elsewhere in
the statistics. Medical courses have the best record. The worst subject for
leaving graduates jobless at the end of the course was forestry, followed by
geography, aero engineering and zoology.
The full statistics, price Pounds 20, are available from the Universities
Statistical Record, PO Box 130, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL50 3SE. Tel:
(0)242 225902.
The index of advertised demand for executives compiled by MSL International,
the recruitment consultant, has not increased in the past three months,
although it is up on last year. Given the weakness of the jobs market during
the summer, this may turn out to be just a blip in the rise out of
recession.
Individual job categories reveal a marked rise in the recruitment of
personnel officers. Ian Lloyd, MSL's managing director, sees this as an
optimistic indicator of economic growth. 'Many companies have survived in
the past two years without expanding. Now they are realising that the human
resource function at a strategic level is critical to the future operation
of the business, we are seeing recruitment at personnel director level.'
The way the index is represented has been changed to conform with Financial
Times practice. Our statisticians say that the wiggly line wavering above
and below the index line is the best way to show the variation from the
trend.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Management: Reaping the benefits - John Willman starts a
series on public services with a success story at Camden benefits office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The customer comes first' is a philosophy that most service organisations
aspire to. But making it a reality in public services is a task that has
de-feated many managers, particularly in inner cities where the welfare
state picks up some of society's most intractable problems.
Yet Camden, the north London borough with an indifferent reputation for its
services and more than its fair share of social deprivation, boasts the
best-run local authority benefits office in the country.
The Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, last year cited the
council's benefits office as a model of good practice in a study which found
that only a third of councils administered benefits well. This week it
received a further accolade in the form of a chartermark, one of the
government's awards for good public service.
Camden includes some of the most prosperous north London districts,
including Hampstead and Bloomsbury. But much of the rest of the borough is
run-down, inner-city estates, with almost half of all households relying on
benefits to pay their rent or council tax. Last year, the office dealt with
more than 56,000 claims and paid out almost Pounds 120m in benefits.
'If Camden with all its inner-city problems can deliver good quality
standards, one must ask why other councils can't,' says the Audit
Commission's Doug Edmonds.
Much of the credit for the borough's outstanding performance goes to Bridget
Cumiskey, Camden's chief benefits officer. A former bank cashier, she
confesses to a 'passion for service'.
'People coming in here already have problems,' says Cumiskey. 'They are
unemployed, they're pensioners dependent on benefits, they are families
living on low pay. It's not our job to make those problems worse. We can be
the difference between misery and helping people to feel good about
themselves and beginning to solve their problems.'
Camden's mission statement is to pay the correct amount of benefit, on time,
and with courtesy and respect. They are principles the office organises to
achieve.
Applicants are seen within 15 minutes of arriving. They are interviewed in
privacy and escorted back to the exit - normally within 30 minutes of
arrival. Most benefit payments are processed in 14 days, with the remaining
5 per cent completed in a further five days.
Success in meeting these targets means Camden has no need for the large
waiting rooms that are typical of many inner-city benefits offices. Nor does
it need security glass to protect its staff. The reception rarely has more
than a dozen people waiting, and all interviews are conducted face to face
around a table.
'If you treat people with respect and in a pleasant manner, there is no need
to put up barriers,' says Cumiskey. 'If you keep customers waiting for two
or three hours, it's not surprising that they get angry.
'I just won't tolerate backlogs. My job descriptions are flexible, and I can
transfer staff very quickly between teams to deal with problems. Sometimes
we'll use Saturday working to clear backlogs, but we also try to avoid
burning staff out through institutionalised overtime.'
All this has been achieved for costs lower than those at similar councils
offering a far worse service. 'We save money by getting things right first
time,' says Cumiskey. 'If you have delays and backlogs of work, people get
desperate and telephone, write letters or come in. Staff dealing with such
inquiries are not doing the job of paying the benefits.'
Camden also takes care to make sure that money isn't paid out to people who
shouldn't get it. The borough is ranked third in the country on fraud
detection, saving more than Pounds 2m last year.
Until recently, there was little incentive for councils to tackle fraud  -
most of the cost of housing benefit is paid for by the government. But
Cumiskey successfully helped lobby the Treasury to let local authorities
keep a share of savings from fraud detection. Camden's share last year was
some Pounds 260,000.
There is no profound secret behind Camden's success, according to one
observer. Cumiskey sets the staff clear targets and makes sure they are met.
Rather than administering benefit in the traditional local authority way,
she manages the office, he says.
Some of that can be put down to training. During her 27 years with Camden,
Cumiskey has been on several management courses. But she is clearly a born
manager, who instinctively knows how to get the best out of people.
Her own explanation is rather more modest. She reckons that much of what she
does reflects what she saw during the 1970s as chairman of the local branch
of Nalgo, the local government union: 'I dealt with managers throughout the
council, and learnt very quickly how not to manage. It gave me the
confidence that I knew as much as they did about management.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Management: Who gets what from the maternity provisions -
New rights for women on leave bring the UK into line with European law / A
look at the changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British women employees whose babies were due on or after 16 October are
entitled to new legal rights and benefits during their maternity leave from
work.
All women now have a statutory right to at least 14 weeks' leave regardless
of length of service or hours of work.
The new maternity rights also guarantee protection against dismissal and the
right to alternative work or suspension with full pay if continuing in the
job is harmful to health.
The changes are intended to bring UK law into line with the European Union
directive on the health and safety of pregnant women agreed two years ago.
How much leave is a woman entitled to?
Maternity leave entitlements for full-time women staff, who have at least
two years' continuous service with their employer, and part-time women with
five years' service, who work fewer than 16 hours a week but more than
eight, have not changed. Everybody else gets 14 weeks.
How much maternity pay is a woman entitled to ?
Women who have worked for the same employer for at least 26 weeks prior to
the 12 weeks before the baby's expected delivery date and earn at least
Pounds 57 a week or more on average qualify for up to a maximum of 18 weeks'
pay.
The pay entitlement for the first six weeks is 90 per cent of the woman's
average earnings and Pounds 52.50 for up to a further 12 weeks. Women who
qualify for only 14 weeks' maternity leave (full-time employees who have not
worked in continuous employment for two years and part-time employees who
have not completed five years' continuous service) and therefore return to
work at or before the end of the 14th week do not receive the last four
weeks of SMP.
Are there some companies who already provide longer leave?
One in four employers already provide more than the statutory minimum. Some
allow periods of up to 52 weeks' leave. These include Abbey National,
British Gas, the civil service and the national health service.
Do some employers pay more than the statutory figure?
A growing number of companies also pay more than the statutory maternity
pay. Marks and Spencer, Rover car group, Amersham International and HP
Bulmer pay 100 per cent of previous earnings for the first six weeks of
maternity leave.
How much will this cost employers?
The cost to employers of the new materity rights has been set at Pounds 65m
a year, 0.03 per cent of the total national wage bill, or Pounds 230 per
expectant mother receiving maternity benefits. Employers are being
reimbursed by the state for up to 92 per cent of the cost of maternity leave
pay from September 4. Small companies - those who pay Pounds 20,000 or less
a year in gross national insurance contributions - are fully reimbursed.
What happens to the other provisions in a woman's contract?
All women on maternity leave continue to benefit from all the terms and
conditions of their contract (including holiday entitlement, pension rights
and company car) except for their normal pay.
Are women protected from unfair dismissal?
The new legislation's guarantee of protection against dismissal means that
all women on maternity leave who are subsequently dismissed must be given
written reasons. There are no set limits on the damages an industrial
tribunal can award if a pregnant woman is unfairly dismissed.
How will the new health and safety regulations affect employers and
employees?
Health and safety rights have been introduced to protect pregnant women,
women who have recently given birth or are breast feeding. An employer is
now required to carry out a risk assessment of working conditions and take
whatever preventable action is reasonable. The law also states that where a
risk to a woman's health is suspected and no alternative work is available,
an employer must suspend the employee on full pay. The regulations are being
revised at present by the Health and Safety Executive.
If suitable alternative work is available but not offered or a woman is
suspended without full pay, she can gain access to an industrial tribunal.
How can women claim their new rights?
To aid employers' planning of employment needs pregnant women have to follow
a procedure to claim any of the new maternity rights. If the procedure is
not adhered to they will lose entitlements.
A woman must give at least 21 days' notice to the employer of the date when
she intends to start her period of leave (the notice need only be in writing
if the employer insists). Maternity leave can begin 11 weeks before the
expected week of childbirth. To receive SMP, 21 days' notice before
beginning leave is required. A copy of the maternity certificate (MAT B1)
must also be sent to the employer.
What steps does a woman employee take to return to work?
The employer may ask for confirmation of intention to return to work eleven
weeks after the start of the maternity leave. A reply in writing must be
given within 14 days. At least 21 days before intention to return to work
the employer should be informed of the exact date of return. An extension
beyond the 29 weeks leave is allowed if a woman is ill. She must inform the
employer of illness and supply a medical certificate. Employers can also
delay return by four weeks, but must give reasons.
What are the main problems with the new rights?
All women are entitled to 14 weeks' maternity leave and only some women are
entitled to 18 weeks' statutory maternity pay. The Department of Employment
calculated that bringing the two into line would add Pounds 50m to annual
business costs.
If a woman is absent sick before her planned maternity leave begins, but
this is a pregnancy-related illness and occurs on or after the sixth week
before the expected week of confinement, maternity leave is automatically
triggered. Some believe this is confusing, too arbitrary and punitive.
Can a woman have her old job when coming back to work?
A woman is entitled to return to the same job she had before she went on
maternity leave on no less favourable terms and conditions of employment.
However, she may request to work on a part-time rather than full-time basis.
Who is not covered by the new regulations?
An estimated 2.25m women, or 20 per cent of the female labour force, who
earn less than Pounds 57 a week fail to qualify for statutory maternity pay.
Any woman who has not been in continuous service with the same employer for
26 weeks will not qualify.
How does UK maternity leave provision compare with the rest of western
Europe?
British women receive the lowest level of maternity pay in the EU with only
up to 14 per cent having statutory entitlement topped up by employers. In
Denmark they receive 22 weeks on full pay during maternity leave, in Germany
they get full pay for 14 weeks and in Italy for 17 weeks.

FT  19 OCT 94 / People: SIB appoints Swiss Bank executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Securities and Investments Board has appointed Tim Shepheard-Welwyn,
most recently chief operating officer of Swiss Bank Corporation's Hong Kong
business, on a two-year secondment to a newly created post of adviser on
international affairs.
Shepheard-Welwyn, formerly a Bank of England boffin, was recruited to SBC in
1987 by Andrew Large, former head of SBCI in London and now chairman of the
SIB. The SIB says it approached several investment banks seeking a
candidate, and that only SBC was interested.
His duties will include co-ordinating the SIB's relationships with other
securities regulators.
He will also be considering the ticklish issue of devising a regulatory
structure for London which allows it to keep its pole position at a time of
increasing internationalisation of securities markets.
SBC has recently attracted hostility from London's investment banking
community for suggesting that it is time to change some of the clubby rules
on underwriting and trading securities, arguing that London risks its
international standing if it fails to do so.
But Shepheard-Welwyn says he has no intention of using his position to
advance SBC's interests.

FT  19 OCT 94 / People: Fresh finance function at Argyll group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Supermarket group Argyll, owner of the Safeway chain, has held back from
appointing a group finance director to replace Colin Smith, promoted to
group chief executive earlier this year, but is appointing a chief financial
officer.
He is Simon Laffin, 35, previously group financial controller, who has been
taking joint responsibility for financial affairs with Colin Smith since the
latter's elevation.
'Although Simon has not taken on the job title of group finance director, he
has effectively assumed most of the duties formerly undertaken by Colin
Smith,' says Argyll.
Laffin is also taking over as finance director of Safeway Stores - now the
dominant part of the group, since the recent sale of Argyll's Lo-Cost
discount chain - in place of Nairn Glen, who moves to become director of
financial control of Safeway. Argyll is currently carrying out a strategic
review of all its businesses, which may result in some further changes in
management responsibilities.
Analysts believe Laffin is being groomed for the title of group FD and a
seat on the board in due course.
He joined Argyll as financial controller in 1990, after holding senior
financial positions with Mars. He is an associate of the Institute of
Chartered Management Accountants.

<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the large UK general insurance company, is breaking with
past practice and appointing a finance director. Peter Foster, 48, will be
responsible for group finance, corporate planning and tax.
The decision underlines the trend within the financial sector towards
appointing board directors with specific responsibilities for the finance
side of operations.
Finance had been the responsibility of Tony Wyand, executive director, who
was also in charge of CU investments. Wyand is now expected to spend an
increasing portion of his time in Paris, overseeing the integration into the
group of French insurer Groupe Victoire, which CU acquired this summer.
Foster was general manager, finance, at CU. He joined the company in 1963.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Howard at International Police Exhibition and Conference
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday tested a viewer for
recording scenes of crime in 3-D at the International Police Exhibition and
Conference at Olympia, London.
At the conference Mr Howard announced a plan to invite crime-hit communities
to bid for Pounds 2m from the government - complemented by private and
public sponsorship - to install closed circuit television systems.
Housing estates, shopping centres, hospitals and car parks will be eligible
to submit bids. Mr Howard said the government would only be looking for
applications from smaller communities and local neighbourhoods since large
towns and cities had already received support for the systems. Bids have to
be submitted by next month. The maximum that schemes will receive is Pounds
100,000. Mr Howard said: 'Given the success of CCTV in many parts of the
country in preventing crime and increasing arrests for crimes committed,
this is an important development.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / DTI may reform Whitehall pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is considering replacing final salary-based pension benefits
for civil servants with less costly personal pensions, it was revealed
yesterday.
The allegations were made by Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the
Association of First Division Civil Servants, who obtained a leaked copy of
a letter from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The letter, addressed to Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the
Treasury, and circulated to cabinet members, said Mr Heseltine's department
would 'look at the issue of portable/personal schemes'.
The move comes as the government faces growing embarrassment over its
failure to control the mis-selling of personal pensions. Up to 500,000
people may have been wrongly advised to transfer out of sound occupational
schemes into personal pensions.
While personal pensions are deemed beneficial for the self-employed and for
those who change jobs frequently, they are considered less advantageous for
those who stay in the same job longer.
The letter also says that the Department of Trade and Industry is
considering selling off the administration of its own employees' pension
scheme. This is in spite of a 1992 report from the Treasury's Efficiency
Unit which concluded that the scheme is administered as efficiently as any
in the private sector.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Print union calls off 18-month strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial action against the Bristol printing company JW Arrowsmith will be
called off today after 18 months of picketing. It has been the longest
dispute in the city's history.
Arrowsmith dismissed 120 employees in April last year after they voted to
take industrial action in pursuit of a national pay claim. At the same time
it derecognised their union, the GPMU.
In spite of an official picket ever since, the family-owned company has
stayed in business and the GPMU has failed to make it negotiate. But the
company has reduced in size and is seeking to sell its site in south Bristol
and move to smaller premises.
Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said last
night that the sacked workers' struggle had inspired trade unionists across
the country. He said the dispute 'should serve to show other employers that
such shortsighted, unjust and anti-union management is no way to build a
successful business'.
Arrowsmith, which was founded in the mid-19th century and specialises in
technical typesetting, dismissed the staff for breach of contract. The
company, which made a loss the previous year, said it had been damaged by an
overtime ban and could not afford the claim for Pounds 6.50 a week and an
extra day's holiday.
It offered to re-employ staff on personal contracts and with a pay freeze,
but only a handful returned.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Burns to unveil shake-up of Treasury today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's permanent secretary, will today spell out
details of a long-awaited internal restructuring plan to the department's
1,400 staff.
The proposals, which some reports suggest could lead to the departure of
perhaps 20 senior officials and a substantial number in lower grades, will
reflect the findings of a fundamental review of the Treasury's spending and
running costs announced in last November's Budget.
This has been combined with an internal inquiry into the style, workload,
and external image of the Treasury that was initiated in early 1992. The
outcome will be one of the most exhaustive reviews of a ministry.
Mandarins elsewhere in Whitehall have looked on in quiet amazement at the
intensity with which Sir Terry has presided over the investigation into the
Treasury's operations and his determination to reshape Whitehall's pivotal
ministry for a greatly changed role in the future.
The pressure for change has come from Sir Terry rather than Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, although it is known that Mr Clarke has an interest
in improving the efficiency of the Treasury, 'delayering' management where
possible, and ensuring that the department functions as a broad economics
ministry.
Much of the impetus for the restructuring has come from developments
elsewhere in government. It has become increasingly difficult to reconcile
the Treasury's traditional 'command and control' style of public-sector
management with an environment in which other ministries operate in a more
decentralised manner and more responsibility is given to executive agencies.
During the summer Sir Terry said that this change in Whitehall management
culture meant that the Treasury was 'looking quite fundamentally at the sort
of jobs we do and asking 'Should we be doing them?'.'
Sir Terry's aim has been for the Treasury to place more emphasis on setting
the agenda for policy and be less involved with detail and second-guessing
other ministries.
It has become apparent in recent weeks that this process would leave some
officials who have monitored activities in spending departments surplus to
requirements.
The review has been handled by Mr Jeremy Heywood, a young Treasury
high-flier who was principal private secretary to Mr Clarke and Mr Norman
Lamont, his predecessor. The process has been supervised by Sir Colin
Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI.
It is unclear how far the proposals, which will be given to staff by Sir
Terry and other top officials at meetings today, will be negotiable.
Treasury officials yesterday declined to comment on a report in the The
Guardian newspaper that the proposed shake-up could result in the departure
of a third of the Treasury's 24 under-secretaries.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Small business hits at cost of banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses believe that banks are providing worse value for money now
than they were four years ago, according to a survey published yesterday by
the Forum of Private Business.
The findings, produced by the University of Nottingham on the basis of 5,500
responses to questionnaires, found that small businesses see transaction
charges as the greatest constraint imposed on their activities by banks.
It also highlights the interest rates charged and the fear of having
overdraft facilities withdrawn as significant restrictions.
Barclays is seen as giving the worst value for money and Royal Bank of
Scotland is seen as giving the best.
Mr Stan Mendham, the forum's chief executive, acknowledged that banks had
tried to improve service to small businesses but criticised their
introduction of codes of practice as a 'one-sided' approach to the issue.
Instead, he said, written contracts between banks and small businesses would
bring greater understanding.
While banks did not generally dispute the survey's validity, and some
expressed concern at the perception of value for money revealed by the
survey, they rejected Mr Mendham's claim that payments by small businesses
were subsidising the charges paid by big companies.
Barclays said it had not made any profit from small business transaction
charges in recent years. Mr John Spence, head of business banking at Lloyds,
said that in small business banking 'we have not been making the sort of
profit that could be subsidising another part of our organisation'.
The survey shows that 43 per cent of small businesses are considering
changing their bank. The forum said, however, that only 5 per cent had
changed their bank in the previous year.
Several banks, including Barclays, Bank of Scotland and National
Westminster, said the poll findings were at odds with higher levels of
satisfaction indicated by their own internal research.
They said that the survey should be seen in the context of constraints on
small businesses arising from broader economic factors.
The FPB plans to publish a further report on individual banks' relationships
with small businesses next month.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Level of injury pay-outs attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compensation for personal injuries in England and Wales is often inadequate
according to research by the Law Commission published yesterday.
It said delays of six years or more in settling claims meant damages were
eaten up by debts and extra expenses incurred before settlement.
The commission surveyed more than 750 victims of accidents occurring between
1967 and 1991. They had received compensation from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds
100,000 or more.
The commission found minor injuries could have unexpectedly severe
consequences and serious injuries did not necessarily result in big
settlements.
More than 50 per cent of victims in work at the time of the accident never
returned to the same job and a substantial minority never returned to work.
Almost 90 per cent of those receiving damages of Pounds 100,000 or more left
their job as a result of the accident. Many victims who did return were
forced to leave owing to the continuing effects of their injuries.
This resulted in a significant burden of unpaid care being shouldered by
family or friends.
Although most victims were satisfied at the time of settlement with what
appeared to be a substantial sum of money, this satisfaction decreased
dramatically as they realised the long-term effects of their injuries and
their reduced capacity to work.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Magill, the district auditor investigating the alleged 'homes for
votes' scandal at Westminster City Council, announced yesterday that he will
not disqualify himself from further involvement in the case.
Public hearings into the affair, over which Mr Magill will preside, will
start today.
Dame Shirley Porter, the former leader of the council, who with eight others
faces paying a surcharge of Pounds 21.25m if the auditor does not change his
provisional findings on the case, had called for him to disqualify himself.
Dame Shirley will be appealing against the auditor's decision 'at the
appropriate time', but will take part in the hearings.
Mr Neale Coleman, one of the objectors to the council's alleged policy, said
the application for Mr Magill to disqualify himself had been 'a waste of
everyone's time and money'.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Shephard cool on nursery vouchers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, has played down speculation
that the government would use a voucher system to fund its projected
expansion of nursery education to cover all four-year-olds, John Authers
writes.
Speaking to The Independent newspaper, she said voucher systems were
'unwieldy' and said: 'You don't want the machinery to overshadow the
policy.'
Mr John Major gave a strong hint last week that the government would use
vouchers when he told the Conservative party conference that nursery funding
'must promote diversity and parental choice' and must not crowd out 'private
and voluntary provision'.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Business invited to join the club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Football diplomacy in the cause of economic regeneration is the new weapon
of Newcastle United Football Club, the Premiership leaders.
Sir John Hall, United chairman and a champion of his native north-east, has
decided to turn his team's success into a platform for local companies
seeking new business overseas.
When Newcastle play Bilbao in Spain in a fortnight, 20 north-east
businessmen will be at the game, cheering on the Magpies before meetings the
next day aimed at building on the team's expected victory.
Football diplomacy has already scored a success for Sir John, who recently
invited executives from Samsung, the Korean group then seeking a European
site, to St James' Park where they saw Newcastle beat Royal Antwerp 5-2.
This week Samsung announced its new Pounds 450m electronics complex was to
be located at Wynyard Park, Cleveland, on land owned by Sir John's family
business Cameron Hall Developments.
If, as Sir John and manager Kevin Keegan intend, United's winning streak
continues into future legs of the Uefa cup, more business people will
accompany the team on its European trips, with the promise of support at
marketing functions from Sir John, Kevin Keegan and the players to reinforce
the image of success.
The 20 business people for the Bilbao trip will have to pay travel costs of
about Pounds 400 each. They are being sought by Mr Ron Seymour, trade
missions manager for the Northern Development Company, the economic
regeneration body for north east England and Cumbria.
Those going along need not be United supporters. 'Business is business,'
says Mr Seymour, who operates from the NDC's Middlesbrough office.
Evidently Kevin Keegan sees success as a two-way process. Sir John recalled
after concluding the Wynyard Park deal: 'He rang me up and said:
'Congratulations boss. When you get your money can I have two players?'.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Heseltine confirms regional aid future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, insisted yesterday that
the government is committed to the regional aid policy which this week
helped win for Britain a Pounds 450m investment by Samsung, the Korean
industrial group.
Mr Heseltine said the idea that the system of regional selective assistance
grants, under which the Samsung investment has been offered Pounds 58m,
would be abandoned was 'trivia'. He said: 'There are no question marks over
the programme.' Asked on BBC Radio 4 yesterday if he could guarantee that
grants for next year would not be less than the current year, he said:
'These programmes I am dealing with are spread over several years and my
department is actively negotiating across the world in order to continue
this inward investment into Britain.'
RSA grants are made to encourage job-creating investments in areas of
Britain needing economic regeneration. In 1993-94 Pounds 341m was spent.
In August ideological differences between ministers over the principle of
such intervention became public with the leaking of a letter to Mr Heseltine
from Mr Michael Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury. In the
letter Mr Portillo said he saw no strong case for retaining the regional aid
scheme.
When on Monday Samsung announced its choice of Cleveland for a new
electronics complex, Mr Portillo, now employment secretary, welcomed the
news but made no mention of the grant incentive offered.
In spite of Mr Heseltine's support for the regional aid principle the DTI
earlier this year started scrutinising applications for grants in England
more stringently, arousing concern from economic development agencies that
areas needing regeneration might lose out.
The tightening is due to various factors, including constraints on public
spending, additions to the assisted areas map, and an increased stress in
granting aid on the quality of jobs created.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Property deals pull in Pounds 230m for new-towns commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Commission for the New Towns, the government agency which owns the
remaining public assets of England's 21 former new towns, raised Pounds 230m
cash in the year to the end of March, up from Pounds 160m.
In July last year Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said that the
commission would be wound up by March 1998. It has already been split into
two slimmed-down agencies responsible for marketing the remaining land and
buildings.
The commission's annual report, published yesterday, shows commercial
property sales valued at Pounds 130m. A further Pounds 111m came from the
transfer of housing assets to the local authority and housing associations
in Basildon.
After tax and loan interest the commission returned Pounds 117m to the
government, bringing its total contributions to the Exchequer in the past
five years to Pounds 867m. The commission made 500 sales during the year,
compared with 430 in 1992-93.
Sir Neil Shields, chairman, said market conditions had improved since the
begining of the financial year and that Pounds 95m from commercial
transactions had already been received.
He estimated that receipts for the current full year would be about Pounds
162m.
The commission still owns 2.5m sq ft of commercial and industrial floor
space and 19,000 acres of land. Most of its remaining assets are in Milton
Keynes and former new towns in the North and Midlands, such as Telford and
Warrington.
Holdings in the former new towns surrounding London have dwindled. Excluding
the Basildon housing transaction, which involved the transfer of 13,000
homes and leaves the CNT with virtually no residential housing, receipts
from towns in Southern England amounted to only Pounds 35m.
The commission employs 450 people, down from a peak of 1,100 during the mid
1980s. The number of employees is projected to fall to 220 by 1997/98.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A drive to attract more manufacturing investment to greater London was
launched yesterday by Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, in a move
that marks the first concerted attempt to reverse the decline of the capital
as a manufacturing centre.
The greater London manufacturing workforce has dropped from more than
800,000 in the early 1970s to 300,000. This is just 11 per cent of the
area's total workforce, compared with a nationwide figure of 20 per cent.
Mr Eggar's initiative also aims to ensure existing manufacturers get the
best deal from central and local government. It comes a day after Samsung,
the Korean industrial group, announced plans to build a Pounds 450m
manufacturing plant in the north-east of England, eventually creating 3,000
jobs.
He said this showed how development agencies, local authorities and Training
and Enterprise Councils elsewhere in the UK were working effectively with
government to attract new manufacturers. 'Other regions of the UK are old
hands at this,' he told the parliamentary manufacturing industry group.
Mr Eggar, MP for Enfield North, said London could not escape blame for
undervaluing its manufacturing sector. 'The false stereotype of the London
businessman with his pinstriped suit and bowler hat has been equally
misleadingly replaced by the image of a young man with red braces
wheeler-dealing in front of an exchange room computer screen,' he said.
An anti-manufacturing culture had been perpetuated. Companies faced with the
opportunity to expand had found it easier to move elsewhere rather than work
through the issues with their local workforce, local authorities and
government.
Mr Eggar said the government could not prescribe a recipe for success.
Instead, central government, local authorities, agencies such as the London
First forum and companies needed to work together to ensure that London
thrived as a base for manufacturing.
As a first step, he plans to bring together some of the capital's most
important manufacturers to agree priorities for action.
But he identified three key issues which he said London needed to address
urgently:
TECs must ensure that the skills of London's workforce match industry's
needs.
Boroughs need a proactive programme to nurture manufacturing industry.
Local business organisations need to foster supply chains and ensure that
the new London Business Links organisation gives clients a better advisory
service than is now available.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Nurses' pay is unfair says poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Three in four people believe nurses are not paid fairly for their work, says
a survey today which was commissioned by the Royal College of Nursing.
The poll represents a boost to the nurses' campaign for an inflation-busting
8.3 per cent pay rise. It also shows overwhelming support for a nurse's
right to speak out in defence of patient care.

Two South Yorkshire coal mines which failed to attract bids in the
government's recent auction of British Coal assets are to be sealed
permanently.
Goldthorpe Colliery near Doncaster and Kiveton Colliery near Sheffield were
already on 'care and maintenance' - work had ceased, but they were being

FT  19 OCT 94 / Interest rate rise rocks north-east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'needless' rise in interest rates last month has started to suppress a
fragile regional economy, according to a survey by the Trades Union Congress
in Yorkshire and Humberside, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Mr Paul Jagger, TUC regional secretary, yesterday warned that any further
rises in rates would have a 'very detrimental' effect. Yorkshire and
Humberside's growth had been only modest so far.
He said a regional survey by the TUC showed steel industry production up 1.4
per cent to 323 tonnes a week in August, but concerns that energy prices
would rise, damaging profitability, were increasing .
Mr Jagger said the TUC was particularly concerned about lack of new jobs and
investment in higher education, in spite of increasing numbers of students.
Government funding was getting tighter.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Taming the dragon for an uncertain future: How structural
changes to the Welsh Development Agency aim to improve its reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At London's Paddington station a huge illuminated sign tells departing
travellers: 'Wales gets your business on the right track. For successful
business, contact the Welsh Development Agency - the Welsh Advantage.'
That advantage has been put in doubt. Criticism by the Commons public
accounts committee last year caused it to become one of the most notorious
of UK quangos. Since then the WDA's management has been replaced and its
structure reorganised. But politically its future is at stake.
In a few days' time its corporate plan will be discussed with Mr John
Redwood, Welsh secretary. This week Mr Rhodri Morgan, the Labour MP for
Cardiff West who acted as the WDA whistle-blower, is tabling Commons
questions to Mr Redwood asking what consultation is taking place.
He said: 'The WDA is fighting for its life, mostly against Mr Redwood's
inability to accept there can be such a thing as beneficial intervention in
a market economy by a state agency. He wants it shrunk to a core operation.'
The Welsh Office, embarrassed by its hands-off supervision which failed to
check the malpractices, appears anxious to show it has tamed the dragon. The
agency will, for example, be allowed less say in forming regional
development policy.
But asked about the WDA's survival, Mr Redwood was adamant. 'I have been
crystal clear: the agency is remaining and there are no proposals to remove
it,' he said. 'I have given it a very clear set of tasks which I want it to
excel in. They have no reason to worry on my score.'
Its first task, he said, was to promote inward investment. Secondly, the WDA
was to assist with urban regeneration schemes 'and not to dominate or go
against local plans. I look to local authorities for vision and leadership'.
Its third main role was to continue its programme of land reclamation.
This suggests a significant redirection. In the past the WDA took the lead
in joint ventures. Councils, being accountable to the electorate, will now
take charge.
In addition the agency's role as an industrial property developer is largely
over. Mr Redwood said there were 'an awful lot of empty factories out there'
and the WDA would seek to sell about Pounds 180m worth of land and property
in the next two years.
Once the sell-off is complete, the funding shortfall will have to be met
either by an increased grant or by a reduction in the agency's programmes.
At present government grant provides 46 per cent of the Pounds 161m budget.
In future the WDA faces a much tougher fight to secure funding against
competing claims for taxpayers' money.
The overall implication is the WDA will become more modest. The old agency
was symbolised by its headquarters in Cardiff's Pearl House, a gaunt tower
dominating the city's skyline. This autumn more than half the staff have
been made redundant or been relocated to a new regional structure, intended
to devolve responsibility and bring the agency closer to its clients. Before
long the WDA will quit Pearl House for a less imposing location.
Staffing has been cut from 420 to 350 and nearly all the previous senior
management has departed - notably Dr Gwyn Jones, the former chairman, and Mr
Philip Head, chief executive.
Dr Jones performed a high-profile double-act with Mr Redwood's predecessors,
Mr Peter Walker (now Lord Walker) and Mr David Hunt (now employment
secretary). But an inquiry headed by Sir John Caines, after the public
accounts committee report, concluded: 'Good staff management was sacrificed
to the attainment of results.'
The new team of Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman, and Mr Barry Hartop, chief
executive, has recruited most of their top executives externally. Mr Hartop
said: 'We have a fundamental change in management, style, culture, approach
and values. We believe the role of this place is to promote Wales and not
the WDA. That is a rather large change from the way things were run
previously.'
In Mr Rowe-Beddoe's words: 'We recognise that we have the eyes of Wales upon
us.' Although an imminent report into an Aberdare development will disclose
another example of previous dubious conduct, systems have been introduced to
try to prevent future scandals.
A confidential hotline to the legal director has been installed -
previously, staff were too frightened of losing their jobs to raise any
doubts.
Mr Hartop said: 'We now have compliance reviews and have just issued a code
of practice. I'm feeling more and more comfortable that we're conducting
this agency in an appropriate manner for the expenditure of public funds.'
The board - criticised by one former executive as having been 'supine' - has
new members and is more active.
Mr Hartop said the guiding principles were to push power to the new
divisions and be demand-led. The private sector would be involved far more.
In particular, he believed it was right to encourage the private sector to
take over much of the WDA's property functions.
He said: 'We have looked at our property and decided on the level of what I
will call our working capital - what we need to satisfy the needs of inward
investors and indigenous businesses. We should not be a major landholder.'
The new management, which has not been immune from controversy, has yet to
rebuild staff morale. For example, Mr Rowe-Beddoe last April became a
director of Development Securities, a property company. But the perceived
threat to the agency has rallied support for it across a spectrum of Welsh
opinion.
Professor Kevin Morgan, of the University of Wales and author of a recent
report on the WDA, says that Mr Redwood, by being disinclined to support a
public-sector body, has precipitated a crisis. 'There is growing political
polarisation over the agency's role, when what is needed is greater
consensus,' he said.
While Labour urges greater accountability of quangos - saying that the
Conservatives use them to bypass their low electoral success in Wales - it
defends the WDA, which the party set up when in government 18 years ago. Mr
Rhodri Morgan said: 'We have always distinguished between the excessively
freebooting style of the previous regime and our support for the agency
itself, which should not be shrunk in importance. It remains the engineroom
of the Welsh economy.'
Mr Hartop, himself a businessman from the private sector, is convinced Wales
still needs a development agency. In spite of achievements in restructuring
the economy, gross domestic product remains below the UK average. 'Clearly
there are areas which require public support in order to get economic
regeneration,' he said. 'But we are cognizant that we have to get more
private-sector cash, because that in the long term is what will regenerate
Wales.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Ex-WDA chief issues statement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Gwyn Jones, the BBC governor for Wales, has not previously responded to
criticism of his WDA chairmanship, from which he resigned in June last year.
He issued a statement this week: 'During my five years as chairman, the
agency more than doubled the rate of inward investment projects going into
Wales. Capital investment was more than trebled and small businesses to
support the large inward investment projects grew considerably.
'This provided tens of thousands of new direct and indirect jobs and reduced
the unemployment level in Wales to below the national average for the first
time since before the war.
'I was recruited to do a specific job - to increase inward investment and to
make the agency itself more efficient - and it is, therefore, important to
judge the whole effort of the five-year period on the basis of the tasks
originally set against what was achieved.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Questions raised on joint ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Tesco superstore, being built on the edge of Aberdare in the south Wales
valleys, has called into question the way in which the Welsh Development
Agency has run joint ventures.
Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm, has been commissioned by the WDA's new
management and the National Audit Office to investigate the circumstances
behind the development, the result of a joint venture by the agency, Cynon
Valley borough council and Mid Glamorgan county council.
The inquiry report, due to be published in the next few weeks, is expected
to make serious criticisms of the way in which the WDA used its powers to
recommend changes in the management of joint ventures.
The development was intended to be an important part of the regeneration of
Aberdare. When the Tesco store opens in March it will employ 250 people in
an area of high unemployment.
Among the issues is why the WDA paid Pounds 440,000 in 1992 for a site which
had been bought by a South Glamorgan company, Offerdemo, only hours
previously for Pounds 160,000. The process by which the Tesco bid was
successful also raised protests.
The Co-operative Retail Society, which was a bidder, threatened to sue. Last
week it said: 'We are unable to comment for legal reasons.'
The Grant Thornton report is expected to say that there was no personal
involvement in the deal by Mr David Malpas, managing director of Tesco and a
member of the WDA board, and Dr Gwyn Jones, then WDA chairman and
subsequently a Tesco director.
The WDA has kept the Commons public accounts committee informed. It has set
up a group to ensure greater transparency and consultation in joint ventures
and more involvement by the private sector.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Judge calls for fraud tribunal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A tribunal to deal with all criminal, civil and regulatory aspects of
serious fraud was called for yesterday by the former judge in the Guinness
trials.
Lord Justice Henry, who presided over the trials arising from the 1986
Guinness takeover of Distillers, told a fraud forum that the need to avoid
duplication of investigation and adjudication in white-collar crime pointed
to the creation of 'forensic one-stop-shopping' for fraud cases.
He said that issues of guilt, punishment by imprisonment or fine, civil
liability, payment of damages and restrictions on companies' ability to
continue in business should all be adjudicated in one process.
He added that the closest the western world had to such a model was the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the US where, within a statutory
framework of racketeering laws much more hostile than anything in the UK, a
commission suggestion of a plea-bargain became an offer the defendant could
not refuse.
The US system was 'brutal but effective' and the US racketeering laws could
not be transferred entirely to the UK.
The judge said, however, that there was one seemingly fatal objection to his
proposal in that if a defendant pleaded not guilty he could not be sentenced
to more than 12 months in jail without being convicted by a jury.
As juries did not give reasons for their verdicts a jury's criminal verdict
was not sufficiently discriminating to try all the issues which would be
involved in one-stop-shopping.
He said the solution might be for fraud cases to be tried by a judge alone
giving a reasoned judgment. Defendants in serious fraud cases in other
common-law countries, such as New Zealand and Canada, were being offered the
choice of being tried by a judge.
These trials would, he said, provide all the economies of a single
fact-finding trial. The process would be internally consistent, more
manageable, shorter and cheaper.
It would also have the advantage that any appeal could concentrate on the
validity of the conviction rather than questions of procedural irregularity,
or technical misdirection.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Dairy industry warned of threat to investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Foods, one of the UK's biggest dairy groups, yesterday said the
sharp rise in milk prices that will accompany the market's deregulation next
month could drive investment out of Britain.
Mr Neil Davidson, group executive responsible for milk buying, said: 'The
processing industry will be leaner, fitter and more focused. It may also be
somewhere else.'
Mr Davidson told a dairy industry conference in London organised by Agra
Europe, the business information company, that domestic and foreign
investment in new technology and capacity had been thrown into doubt by
deregulation.
This was because of the price rises being introduced by Milk Marque, the
independent farmers' co-operative that will succeed the Milk Marketing
Board, and because of possible challenges to Milk Marque by the competition
authorities.
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, is considering
a formal complaint to the European Commission and the Office of Fair
Trading, claiming that Milk Marque's selling system is an abuse of its
monopoly position. Milk Marque controls at least 65 per cent of supplies in
England and Wales.
Mr Davidson said this made it the biggest milk selling organisation in
Europe.
He criticised the government, saying its original plan to improve UK dairy
competitiveness in Europe 'has been diluted to the achievement of a crude
political objective of abolishing the Milk Marketing Board while protecting
the farmer vote'.
However, Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, will today deny that
prices will rise excessively, saying: 'I object to Milk Marque being made a
scapegoat.'
He will tell the conference that dairy companies have agreed to pay less
than 0.3p per pint more for fresh milk, not 3p as some claim, and that the
price of milk for Cheddar cheese will increase by 13p a pound, not 50p.
The milk board has still not received written loan agreements from its
banks, creating further uncertainty about liberalisation on November 1. It
said yesterday that the loans, which it needs to establish Milk Marque,
should be finalised in the next two days.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Mercury to double its mobile reach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone network operator, is to invest Pounds
230m in doubling the size of its network over the next two and a half years.
The investment, which continues One-2-One's slow expansion, will give the
UK's main population centres four cellular phone networks by early 1997,
making Britain the most competitive market in Europe.
One-2-One currently covers only the south-east and the west Midlands - about
30 per cent of the UK population. The networks of Vodafone and Cellnet, the
two biggest operators, have national coverage. Orange, the newest network,
covers about 65 per cent of the population and plans to extend its coverage
to 70 per cent by the end of the year.
With 140,000 subscribers, One-2-One is small by comparison with Vodafone and
Cellnet, which have about 1.4m and 1.2m subscribers respectively. But the
company claims to be gaining a third of all sales in its coverage area.
Orange, which launched its network in April, refused to disclose subscriber
numbers, prompting speculation among analysts that it was gaining customers
at a slower rate than One-2-One in spite of its wider geographical coverage.
The new investment will extend One-2-One's network to include all of the
Midlands, the north-west, and the south and south-east coast.
Mr Richard Goswell, One-2-One's managing director, said the company did not
intend to cut tariffs or handset prices to attract more subscribers. 'We do
not see any need for a price war. All four operators are comfortable in
their parts of the market,' he said.
Vodafone and Cellnet are also keen to delay serious price competition but
have cut the price of their digital handsets sharply in the past month, to
less than Pounds 100 for the cheapest.
One-2-One's cheapest handsets sell for Pounds 200. Mr Goswell said the
company would not increase subsidies for handsets to reduce the price. 'I
don't believe in giving handsets away. It sends the wrong message about
their value, and we want customers to make decisions based on the long-term
cost of having a mobile phone,' he said.
With more than five mobile phone subscribers per 100 people, the UK has more
usage per head than any European country outside Scandinavia.
Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor,
made the biggest advance of any operator in the quarter to September, with
133,000 net new subscribers compared with 123,000 for Vodafone, which
remains the biggest operator.
The networks of One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West, and
Orange are built to the PCN standard, which requires the installation of
more radio base stations than the GSM standard used by Cellnet and Vodafone.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Employers support pension reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fears that employers will cut back on workers' pensions as a result of new
regulations may be overblown, according to a study.
In the study, by Alexander Clay and Partners, actuarial consultants, 86 per
cent of employers surveyed welcomed the white paper on occupational pension
reform, issued in June.
The survey covered 266 pension schemes with total assets of Pounds 48bn,
about 10 per cent of all UK pension assets.
Eight out of 10 employers were not concerned that proposed minimum solvency
ratios for pension funds would require additional funding, although just
more than a third said trustees might have to revise their scheme's
investment policies as a result.
The rules could force schemes with high numbers of current or deferred
pensioners to shift a greater proportion of their assets from equities to
fixed-interest securities.
Also, 87 per cent of employers supported the transitional arrangements for
phasing in the new minimum solvency test. Employers' groups have called for
an extension of the proposed transitional period.
Some 96 per cent of employers supported the plan for a pensions regulator
although nearly two-thirds of those questioned felt that taxpayers rather
than pension schemes should bear the cost.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Feltrim syndicates run by 'gamblers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Underwriters of three Feltrim syndicates at Lloyd's of London ran their
businesses like imprudent gamblers, the High Court was told yesterday.
The syndicates' total exposures to risk were not properly calculated and
inadequate reinsurance was purchased, said Mr Jeremy Cooke QC, opening the
case for more than 1,600 Feltrim Names.
The Names are suing the underwriters for negligence and are seeking to
recover losses of about Pounds 525m.
The losses were sustained between 1987 and 1989 by syndicates 540, 542 and
847, which specialised in catastrophe insurance. The syndicates suffered
massive losses after disasters such as the 1987 storms and the Piper Alpha
oil platform explosion.
Mr Cooke said the gap between the exposures of the syndicates and the levels
of reinsurance purchased was too big. Nobody running a business prudently
would operate on the basis that if certain events took place the business
would be destroyed, he said. This amounted to simply gambling on whether
those events would happen.
He added: 'Even if gambling, no prudent man would put Pounds 200m on a 100-1
outsider unless he knew he had Pounds 200m available should that 100-1
outsider come home first.'
The case is expected to last until Christmas.

VSEL, the Barrow-based shipyard, was cleared by the Ministry of Defence of

Swan Hunter bid Pounds 210m for the contract to build a helicopter landing

bid Pounds 140m.
Allegations were made that the price gap was so great that VSEL had

FT  19 OCT 94 / HSE to license weapons plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The atomic weapons establishments at Aldermaston, Hampshire, and Burghfield,
Berkshire, are to be subjected to licensing by the Health and Safety
Executive, the government announced last night, Kevin Brown and Ivor Owen
write.
Mr Roger Freeman, the junior defence minister, said the government accepted
'in principle' the HSE's recommendation that the plants' immunity from
safety licensing should be removed.
The announcement, at the end of a Commons debate on defence, followed the
release on Monday of the executive's first published annual reports on four
nuclear weapons plants.
The HSE report on Aldermaston revealed that production of warheads for the
Trident submarine system was shut down last year after an incident.
Earlier, Mr Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, said the government
would curb spending on the homes provided for senior officers and seek cuts
in entertainment costs.
A government motion approving the defence budget was approved by 321 votes
to 32 following a rebellion by Labour leftwingers who voted against the
government in spite of instructions from the Labour front bench to abstain.
A Labour resolution condemning the government for failing to carry out a
comprehensive defence review was defeated by 304 votes to 273, a government
majority of 31. Two Conservatives from constituencies with defence
establishments voted with Labour.
The defence ministry has paid Pounds 28.8m in compensation to female
officers and other ranks dismissed because they became pregnant, the
government said last night.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Thatcher link claim in papers on Saudi arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ministers are to study documents which Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for
Linlithgow, claims show that Mr Mark Thatcher was involved in the Al Yamamah
arms deal between the UK and Saudia Arabia while his mother, Baroness
Thatcher, was prime minister.
Mr Dalyell handed the documents, based on a report from from US intelligence
and an internal British Aircraft Corporation memorandum, to officials in the
Commons during the two-day defence debate.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for defence procurement, said the documents would
be examined, but insisted that the deal was conducted on a
government-to-government basis.
He said: 'No commissions were paid, and no agents or middle men were
involved.'
Mr Dalyell produced the documents after Mr John Major, the prime minister,
challenged MPs who supported allegations that Mr Thatcher had received
Pounds 12m in commissions to produce evidence that could be examined by the
proper authorities.
The prime minister reaffirmed that Lady Thatcher had 'acted with complete
propriety throughout her long and distinguished period as prime minister of
this country'.
Mr Dalyell said the documents highlighted Mr Thatcher's role in the arms
deal, and referred to the part he played in administering a 'sizeable
payment' to the Conservative party.
He challenged a government denial that Sir Clive Whitmore, former permanent
undersecretary at the Ministry of Defence, had told Lady Thatcher of his
disquiet over the involvement of her son in the negotiations on the arms
deal.
Mr Dalyell called for a specific assurance that 'there was no contact on
this issue, official or unofficial, between the permanent secretary to the
Ministry of Defence and the then prime minister'.
Earlier, when Mr Paul Tyler, a Liberal Democrat MP, asked for an assurance
'that your administration is now a sleaze-free zone', Mr Major said: 'I am
as concerned as any member in this House or any person in this country that
we should have the highest standards in public life.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Portillo consolidates EU attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, yesterday consolidated his
attack on the European Union's social chapter provisions, saying that he
would resist any directives from Brussels that reduced employment in the UK.
As the Labour party launched a new broadside against the government for
refusing to direct UK economic development Mr Portillo said that the only
way to create jobs was by promoting low inflation and a prosperous economic
climate.
Answering Commons questions for the first time since he assumed the
employment portfolio Mr Portillo told MPs: 'I want to make sure we do not
destroy jobs in Britain. I am not prepared to have imposed upon Britain
costs on employers which make them less likely to take people on.'
Mr Portillo's attack came as the Labour party criticised the Department of
Environment's urban regeneration programme, saying that plans to promote
local enterprise were turning into a 'smokescreen for cuts' in public
spending.
Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, said the amount of money
being allocated for the Single Regeneration Budget amounted to less than a
quarter of the size of bids made by local authorities and Training and
Enterprise Councils to obtain money under the scheme.
He said that the total allocation for the budget, amounting to Pounds 100m,
had been dwarfed by the overall cuts in funding for urban regeneration over
the next two years, amounting to about Pounds 200m.
Mr Straw said that 469 bids - worth more than Pounds 375m - had been made
for SRB grants in the next financial year.
'Despite its high profile launch earlier this year it is now clear that the
SRB is a gameshow with high entrance fees but very few winners.'
He said that millions of pounds had been wasted in the preparation of bids.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, also joined in the attack on the
government's industrial policies, pledging Labour's active promotion of
information and communications technologies.
He said that Britain had to respond to the revolution in information
technology if it was to compete in the global economy.
He said: 'The white heat of technology in the 1960s has been replaced by the
white light of technology in the 1990s.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Setback hits Dublin peace forum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dublin's plans for a cross-party forum for peace and reconciliation in
Ireland suffered a setback yesterday when the Alliance party, the only party
due to attend which can claim to represent the Protestant community of
Northern Ireland, said that it might pull out unless it receives a larger
allocation of seats.
An Irish government official said Mr Albert Reynolds, the republic's prime
minister, would seek to resolve the wrangle when he met Mr John Alderdice,
the Alliance leader, on Friday.
Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists and Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic
Unionists have said they will not attend. A boycott by the Alliance would
add to the perception among Protestants that the forum is a pan-nationalist
front.
With regard to seat allocation, a spokesman for the small, non-sectarian
Alliance party said: 'Anything less than equal to Sinn Fein is completely
unacceptable.' Under the proposed allocation Sinn Fein would have three
seats, the Alliance two and the SDLP five. For the republic Mr Reynolds'
Fianna Fail party would have nine seats, Labour five and Fine Gael six.
The dispute comes amid renewed calls from Northern Ireland's moderate
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party for the UK to reduce its
troop presence in the province to underpin the peace process.
Dublin is keen to use the forum to build confidence between the two
religious traditions on the island.
The Alliance is moderate and non-sectarian, and unlike the main unionist
parties it favours a Dublin contribution to any solution and is committed to
the Anglo-Irish talks.
It has never won a seat in parliament but has the same number of councillors
as Sinn Fein, received only slightly fewer votes than Sinn Fein at the
general election and had a bigger representation at the last Stormont
assembly.

FT  19 OCT 94 / New car sales forecast to show 8% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford and Vauxhall forecast yesterday that new car sales in the UK would
total about 1.92m in 1994, an increase of nearly 8 per cent from 1.78m last
year.
The rate of growth has slowed significantly in the last four months, however
 -with private sales particularly weak - forcing carmakers to lower
forecasts for the year.
The leading UK dealer organisation attacked the makers for overpricing cars.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers' Association,
said that 'prices of new cars could be cut by as much as Pounds 2,000 if
manufacturers abandoned two-tier pricing and stopped adding expensive
specification items purely to influence corporate buyers'.
He added: 'It is not surprising that the retail customer has shown
insufficient confidence to invest in today's overpriced product.'
Prices could be reduced by 10 per cent, or about Pounds 1,000 on an average
saloon car, if manufacturers stopped giving fleet buyers excessive discounts
at the expense of the private buyer, Mr Pulham said.
'The price cut could be doubled if vehicle specifications were made more
relevant to today's market,' he said. '1994 vehicles are grossly
overspecified and as a consequence overpriced.'
Mr Pulham has previously attacked carmakers for distorting the market by
encouraging the pre-registering of cars by dealers in order to gain market
share without the cars having a final buyer.
Mr Charlie Golden, chief executive of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General
Motors, said: 'We were disappointed by the market's activity in the past two
months, but we see no reason to panic.'
Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said that 'according to all
the economic indicators' the recession was finished but 'the message has yet
to get through to the general buying public'.
He called on the UK government to follow France and Spain in introducing
financial incentives to encourage the scrapping of old cars. About 10 per
cent of vehicles - particularly unregulated diesel cars - caused 50 per cent
of vehicle pollution, he said.
'It's time for the government to look at the actions taken in France and
Spain to stimulate sales of new cars and, more importantly, to encourage the
removal of the older vehicles that do most damage.'
The scrapping incentives in France and Spain had had a marked impact on
economic activity and had started to take older cars and vehicles off the
road, Mr McAllister added.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Drop in train orders risks 35,000 jobs, says Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British-based companies building railway engines and carriages face
extinction because of a lack of new orders in the approach to rail
privatisation, Mr Brian Wilson MP, Labour transport spokesman, said
yesterday.
There was a danger that no orders would be placed with British manufacturers
by UK companies this year, risking up to 35,000 jobs in the rolling stock
and railway equipment supply industry, he said.
Mr Wilson said there were only definite orders from customers in Taiwan and
London Underground to carry the industry beyond the end of 1995.
'The government's much vaunted private public finance initiative is a fiasco
as far as train building is concerned. The solitary potential order under
the scheme, for the Northern Line trains, has only been acceded to under
intense political pressure,' Mr Wilson said.
ABB Transportation, the Swiss-Swedish company with manufacturing plants in
Derby and York said: 'We are extremely concerned about our order book.'
ABB finishes work on trains for the Underground's Central Line this year and
on trains for BR's Network SouthEast division next October.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Sainsbury chief admits supermarket 'greed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Britain's biggest supermarket group admitted yesterday that
big food retailers had been 'greedy' in the 1980s and allowed prices for
basic foods to 'drift upwards', opening a gap for cut-price discount chains.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman of J. Sainsbury, also suggested the big grocery
retailers had been wrong to desert town centres, and were finding new ways
of trading successfully from high-street stores as well as out-of-town
superstores.
Mr Sainsbury said at the annual convention of the Institute of Grocery
Distribution that in their rapid expansion since the mid-1980s grocery
retailers had 'allowed the pendulum to swing too far in two areas'.
He said: 'The major food retailers in the 1980s concentrated heavily on
meeting the increasing demands of customers for convenience, service and
quality, and in so doing we allowed the prices on some basic commodities to
drift upwards. This provided an opportunity for discounters to undercut us.'
Over the past year, he said, superstores had cut prices on basic goods and
returned to the 'historical position' where the gross profit on such
products was small 'because the costs of selling them are very low'.
Answering questions after his presentation Mr Sainsbury conceded that
superstore groups had been 'greedy', but joked that this meant trying to
make a profit margin of a few per cent on products such as bread and milk,
on which they previously made virtually no profit.
Mr Sainsbury suggested the big groups had been mesmerised by the efficiency
and popularity of edge-of-town supermarkets, and forgot that there would
always be some business located in town centres.
He added: 'The market did, however, work extremely effectively and a number
of chains, including the discounters, moved in to fill the gap.' Sainsbury
now favoured remodelling and refurbishing town-centre stores to extend their
life, rather than closing them.
Mr Sainsbury's view was echoed by Mr David Reid, finance director of Tesco,
the UK's second biggest food retailer, who said retailers could now achieve
acceptable rates of return from smaller stores.
Mr Sainsbury's comments came as Mr Henrick Gundelach, managing director of
Netto, the Danish discounter which has been operating in the UK since 1990,
said that discount competition in the grocery market would increase.
He told a conference organised by Verdict, the retail research group, that
the number of discount chains would increase from between three and four to
between eight and 10.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Tory corruption probe stays private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour MPs yesterday admitted defeat in a campaign to force the Commons
privileges committee to hear corruption allegations against two
Conservatives in public.
The committee's Conservative majority voted to meet in private to hear
evidence that Mr Graham Riddick (Colne Valley) and Mr David Tredinnick
(Bosworth) were prepared to accept Pounds 1,000 to table Commons questions.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, the Labour MP for Workington, who was one of the
prime movers behind the establishment of the committee, but is not a member,
said the decision was 'an outrage'.
Labour members of the committee refused to comment on the debate because of
parliamentary rules requiring the proceedings of the committee to be kept
secret.
They appeared deeply unhappy with the decision to sit in private, however.
Some are thought to be considering whether to resign from the committee in
protest.
Labour MPs believe that quitting the committee before it starts its formal
investigation would undermine its authority and raise questions about the
relevance of its findings.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons and chairman of the committee, said
the decision to sit in private was in line with long-standing conventions.
He said the committee would publish the evidence when its hearings were
concluded, and would decide later whether to consider the wider issues of
parliamentary privilege in public.
Other Conservative members of the committee refused to comment, but one said
privately that the best interests of both MPs - who have strenuously denied
any wrongdoing - would be served by hearing evidence in private.
He said: 'It should not be held in public because we do not think we could
get to the root of the matter, and it would not be beneficial to the two
people under investigation.
'There would be all sorts of press comment on the rights and wrongs of it
before we came out with our own findings.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Major to insist IRA gives up its Semtex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday signalled that a readiness by the IRA to hand over
its Semtex explosive and detonators will be one of the first tests applied
by his government to the long-term intentions of the republican movement.
As cabinet ministers prepared for a meeting which is expected to pave the
way for a positive but limited response to the cessation of violence, Mr
Major told MPs that the issue of the IRA's armaments would be 'crucial' to
the process.
But, answering questions in the Commons, he appeared to suggest that
initially at least, the government was prepared to differentiate between
guns and explosives. He said: 'The question of armaments, and especially
Semtex and detonators perhaps more than guns, are crucial issues that will
have to be dealt with.'
Downing Street officials subsequently rejected any suggestion that he was
signalling that the IRA might be able to keep its guns. But senior unionists
have raised the possibility that the surrender of IRA weapons might be
staggered, with explosives and heavy weapons handed in first as they could
be used only in an offensive capacity. The republicans might say that they
need initially to hold on to their guns in case of a resurgence of loyalist
terrorism.
Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist, told Mr Major yesterday
that until the terrorists handed over their arms and Semtex explosives there
was a danger of them being used by breakaway paramilitary groups.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP said: 'It is the IRA's intention at
active service unit level to recommence their violence in the month of
January or as soon thereafter as they believe they can do so.'
The unionists estimate the IRA still has about two tonnes of Semtex as well
as more than 1,000 high-velocity rifles and a range of heavy machine guns
and rocket launchers.
Mr Major and senior cabinet ministers are expected to agree as early as
tomorrow to respond formally to the IRA ceasefire by announcing that it is
the government's 'working assumption' that the violence has ended for good.
That could pave the way for informal contacts before Christmas with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, to discuss the terms under which it would be
allowed to join talks on the province's future. But senior ministers
privately acknowledge that the arms issue will be critical.
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, yesterday told the Dail, the
Irish parliament, that peace negotiations could not be concluded until
paramilitaries on both sides had handed over their arms. He said the
government had made this point to Sinn Fein.
Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, may hold a summit
meeting this month to try to remove the obstacles that are still blocking
the completion of a framework document to guide the talks process.

FT  19 OCT 94 / PM on defensive over sleaze claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday forced on to the defensive over allegations of
'sleaze' inside the Conservative party as opposition MPs pressed home claims
that leading Tories were guilty of corruption.
In the first prime minister's question time since the summer recess, Mr John
Major issued a staunch defence of his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher, over
suggestions that her son had received Pounds 12m in commissions from a 1980s
arms deal.
The prime minister told the Commons that Lady Thatcher had 'acted with
complete propriety throughout her long and distinguished period as prime
minister of this country'.
He also called on Labour MPs to provide firm evidence of any impropriety by
his predecessor, rather than 'peddling' speculative remarks.
However, amid claims that Mr Mark Thatcher had been heavily involved in the
Al Yamamah arms deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia, Labour MPs continued
to call for further investigation.
Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, claimed in the Commons that Sir
Clive Whitmore, the former permanent undersecretary at the Ministry of
Defence, had told Lady Thatcher of his disquiet over the involvement of her
son in the arms negotiations.
Mr Nicholas Soames, armed forces minister, rejected the claim, saying: 'Sir
Clive Whitmore has already denied the veracity of that story.'
Labour MPs were also hoping that the Commons public accounts committee would
launch an investigation into Mr Thatcher's involvement at a private meeting
today.
Yesterday, replying to a call from Mr Paul Tyler, a Liberal Democrat MP, for
an assurance 'that your administration is now a sleaze-free zone,' Mr Major
insisted: 'I am as concerned as any member in this House or any person in
this country that we should have the highest standards in public life.'
Mr Major later insisted that a report into allegations of insider share
dealing against Lord Archer, the former Conservative party deputy chairman,
should not be published.
Responding to opposition demands for publication of the DTI inspectors'
report, Mr Major said there was no legal provision for such a move.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Spending on top brass to be curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to curb excessive spending on the homes provided for
senior officers in the armed forces and look for cuts in official
entertainment costs, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr Nicholas Soames, the armed forces minister, indicated that action would
soon be taken when responding in the Commons last night to further
complaints about the spending of Pounds 250,000 on refurbishing an air chief
marshal's house.
The minister said a report by Ms Sheila Masters of KPMG Peat Marwick into
the cost of the work was near completion.
Mr Soames promised to consider with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, the 'follow-up action' required.
He said that Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman of APV and deputy chairman of GKN,
was conducting a review of the official entertaining undertaken by senior
officers as part of their duties.
Mr Soames said particular consideration would be given to whether there were
alternative and more cost-effective means than the use of official service
residences and other service married quarters for entertaining.

FT  19 OCT 94 / PSBR cut by surprise tax boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unexpected boost in tax receipts brought government borrowing down to
Pounds 4.08bn in September, edging slightly below City forecasts of Pounds
4.3bn.
September's figure brings the public sector borrowing requirement for the
first six months of the financial year to Pounds 19.5bn, down from Pounds
23.9bn in the same period last year, indicating that the Treasury is still
well on course for its forecast of Pounds 36.1bn for the PSBR in 1994-95.
The Central Statistical Office said the rise in tax revenues was largely due
to early payments of corporation tax, which usually are not received until
October. Companies were encouraged to file taxes early by the introduction
of the pay and file scheme, an incentive plan allowing companies to earn
interest on overpayments.
Receipts from taxes, excise duties and other income totalled Pounds 19.26bn
for September, representing a 20 per cent increase from Pounds 16.11bn in
the same month last year. Cash receipts so far this financial year are 8 per
cent up from the previous year.
Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'So far this
year revenue growth has been rather weak. But in the last couple of months
the figures on tax revenues have been very encouraging indeed.'
The government's purse was filled with Pounds 59m in early receipts from the
third call of the third tranche of BT shares. Excluding these privatisation
proceeds the underlying PSBR was Pounds 4.14bn in September and Pounds
21.8bn in the first six months of the year, compared with Pounds 27.4bn in
the same period last year.
Central government borrowing on its own account was Pounds 4.65bn in
September and Pounds 21.7bn for the financial year to date, against Pounds
25.2bn in the same six months last year. The overall public sector figure
was improved by the debt repayments of local authorities and public
corporations.
Cash outlays by the government in September were Pounds 23.9bn, up from
Pounds 22.3bn in September last year and Pounds 20.96bn in August. The
running total for the financial year to date is Pounds 128.0bn, an increase
of 3 1/2 per cent from the same period last year.
Spending by departments was Pounds 21.8bn in September and Pounds 120.1bn in
the first six months of the financial year, only 1 1/2 per cent up from
Pounds 118.4bn in the same months in 1993-94.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, said: 'It now appears that
expenditure is picking up more than we had expected so I think this month's
figure will tame some of the more optimistic forecasts for the PSBR this
year.'
Construction orders fell by 5 per cent in the three months to the end of
August, compared with the three months to the end of May, the Department of
the Environment said yesterday.
It added that orders were 5 per cent higher than the same period last year,
suggesting that the slow recovery in construction activity is generally
being maintained.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BIRMINGHAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Daewoo group, South Korea's third largest car maker, is planning to
quadruple its worldwide production capacity to around 2m cars a year by
2000, Mr Woo-Choong Kim, Daewoo chairman, said yesterday.
Daewoo would produce around 500,000 cars this year, and was planning to
raise output to 700,000 in 1995.
The group has embarked on a five-year, Dollars 5bn investment programme from
1995 to 1999, said Mr Kim, which would raise capacity in South Korea to
around 1m cars a year with a further 1m units of capacity being created
overseas, most importantly in Romania, India, China and Uzbekistan.
The Daewoo expansion is one of the most ambitious projects launched by any
of the world's leading car makers in recent years, as it seeks to break into
the ranks of the world's top ten vehicle manufacturers.
Mr Kim said that the group had completed this month the acquisition of a 51
per cent stake in Automobile Craiova, the small Romanian carmaker, formerly
known as Oltcit.
'We think we are going to produce about 100,000 cars a year in Romania
starting at the end of 1996,' said Mr Kim.
Daewoo could begin with the local assembly in Romania of kits supplied from
Korea, but it planned to start production in 1996 of a new small car
currently under development as the group's first world car.
This would be a 1.3 and 1.5 litre supermini, the size of the Ford Fiesta or
Renault Clio. Daewoo also planned production of this car in India, and China
as well as in Romania and in Korea.
'We are going to produce engines and transmissions in Romania,' Mr Kim said.
Total investment planned for the project was around Dollars 500m, he said,
and cars would also be exported to other east European markets.
Production would begin in Uzbekistan next year with plans to raise output to
200,000 a year by 2000. Daewoo was investing Dollars 600m in this project in
a 50/50 joint venture with the Uzbekistan government, said Mr Kim.
The group was planning production of its Cielo small family car as well as
the Tico range of mini cars and light commercial vehicles with sales in the
markets of central Asia and Russia.
In India Daewoo had just purchased a 51 per cent stake in DCM Toyota, an
ailing truck maker, which it planned to transform into a car maker with a
capacity for 200,000 cars a year by 2000.
It planned a investment of around Dollars 500m in India. Production of the
Daewoo Cielo (to be called the Nexia in the UK, where it goes on sale next
year) would be followed later by the introduction of the group's new world
car.
Mr Kim said that Daewoo had received preliminary approval from the Chinese
government last year to establish co-operative projects with the First
Automotive Works for the manufacturing of both components and a passenger
car which would be a joint development project with China with production
possibly beginning in 1997.
Investment in the China project could total Dollars 2bn, shared equally by
Daewoo and its Chinese partner. Daewoo launched its cars in Europe for the
first time at the Birmingham motor show yesterday with sales in the UK
planned to begin in 1995. It has scheduled a launch in the North American
market in 1996.
Mr Kim said that the group's main growth would come in the developing
markets of Asia, east Europe and possibly Latin America, rather than in west
Europe and the US. 'The newly created markets we are going into are growing
much faster than the main world markets,' he said.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Dow to invest in east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dow Chemical of the US intends to take control of the core of the former
East German chemical industry in a deal which will bring DM2.9bn (Dollars
1.87bn) of investment from the Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency.
Through its subsidiary Dow Deutschland, Dow intends to buy majority stakes
in the steam cracker at Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the
electrochemical units and derivative operations at Buna, and the
intermediate chemical operations at Leuna.
The three units formed the basis of the old East Germany's chemical industry
before unification. Since then, the Treuhand has been planning to hive off
the entire industry to private investors.
It has been engaged in a big restructuring programme aimed at attracting
investors to install a new steam cracker facility and oil refinery in the
region.
The Treuhand has been providing generous financial investment incentives for
the Leuna/Buna/Bohlen chemical sector, in which 68,500 people had been
employed before 1990. This figure has fallen sharply to 12,300 through
closures, redundancies and early retirement schemes.
The Treuhand will invest DM2.9bn to modernise the polyolefin complex at Buna
and to build a pipeline from the east German northern port of Rostock. This
line will ship gas sold by Gazprom, the Russian state-owned utilities
company, to Buna.
Treuhand officials said that majority control of the Buna complex's equity
would pass to Dow over time. The Treuhand would retain a 49 per cent stake
for several years. Dow would eventually acquire 76 per cent of Buna's
equity, with Gazprom taking the rest.
Buna is this year expected to have a turnover of DM800m and losses of about
DM300m. However, Treuhand officials said Buna could move into the black in
four years and the investments would be completed by the end of the decade.

Kawasaki Steel has signed a contract with General Motors to supply hot and
cold-rolled steel sheet for vehicle body parts and components. The contract
represents a shift in GM's 'buy American' policy, which the Japanese
steelmaker believes has prevented it from receiving orders from GM for 20
years. Ford terminated purchases from Kawasaki in 1991 in a 'buy American'
policy, while Chrysler stopped buying from the Japanese company after
Japanese steelmakers were hit by anti-dumping charges in 1992. Recent price
increases by US steel companies may have been a factor behind GM's policy
shift, Kawasaki said.

Italian-Thai Development, Thailand's largest construction company, confirmed
yesterday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Philippines
government for a Dollars 3bn project to turn the former US Clark airbase
north of Manila into an international airport. The project would be a
'build-operate-transfer' scheme to convert the airbase into a passenger and
cargo airport with an aircraft maintenance centre by the end of 1997; to
develop a 'mass transit' railway system from Clark to Makati, the Metro
Manila business district, and on southwards to the industrial zone
south-east of the capital; and to expand and improve road links to Clark.
It is not clear, however, how the plan to redevelop Clark will fit in with a
similar and further advanced project for nearby Subic Bay, the former US
naval base, which also has a big airport.

Mr Henri Conze, procurement chief at the French defence ministry, said UK
participation was 'fundamental' to the project because the British might buy
60 of the planned 300 aircraft. Also, British involvement would help ensure
that the Airbus consortium would carry out the project, he said.
Last month, Airbus announced plans to establish a new military equipment
subsidiary to manage the development and production of the Future Large
Aircraft (FLA), Europe's proposed military transport plane. The separate
military subsidiary would include the Italian aerospace company, Alenia, as
well as the four Airbus partners, Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale, British
Aerospace and Casa, of Spain.
The move was designed to strengthen the FLA group and to help market the
aircraft to potential customers - including the UK's Royal Air Force.
British Aerospace has been lobbying hard to persuade the UK defence ministry
not to buy any more Lockheed transport planes from the US but to join the
FLA project endorsed by France, Germany and some other European governments.
Mr Conze predicted that Airbus could build the FLA 35 per cent more cheaply
than the traditional cumbersome forms of international collaboration. 'But
how can we achieve this if BAe is not in the programme, or if BAe is in, but
the UK government is not in?' he asked during yesterday's opening of
Euronaval, the biennial maritime equipment exhibition which France has
opened for the first time to other Europeans.
At next month's Franco-British summit, which is likely to be dominated by
defence issues, the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, is expected
to press Mr John Major, his UK opposite number, to go with the FLA rather
than Lockheed. France is also hoping that Mr Michael Heseltine, the
president of the board of trade, will show the same support for the European
option as he did in the Westland affair in the mid-1980s.
CMN, the French shipbuilder which recently failed to reach agreement to take
over the bankrupt Swan Hunter yard in Newcastle, yesterday announced a
marketing agreement with BAe Dynamics to put the latter's missiles on CMN's
range of missile boats.

FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US duties 'broke fair trade rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last year breached international fair trade rules in levying
anti-subsidy duties on imports of hot-rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel
from France, Germany and Britain, a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
panel has decided.
Though the amount of trade involved is small - about Dollars 19m a year -
the judgment corroborates repeated allegations by Washington's trading
partners that US anti-subsidy (and anti-dumping) rules are unfairly biased
against imports. It also suggests that the US could be found in breach of
Gatt rules in a second panel case, this time involving countervailing duties
imposed on carbon steel flat-rolled products from six European Union states.
The Gatt panels arise from a wave of anti-dumping and countervailing duty
suits brought by US steel producers in 1992 following the expiry of
voluntary export restraint arrangements. Though most of the 70-odd suits
were later dismissed by the US International Trade Commission, some
definitive duties were imposed.
The first panel report, which went to Washington and Brussels last Friday,
broadly upholds the EU complaint that US methods of calculating
countervailing duties artificially inflate the level of alleged steel
subsidies. However, the panel did not accept every aspect of the EU case.
The report says the US commerce department failed to give the steel
exporters involved sufficient opportunity to present evidence. It was also
wrong to treat debt forgiveness by private banks as a subsidy and to assume
subsidies to a state-owned company were 'passed through' on privatisation.
The panel nevertheless ruled that the US was entitled to average subsidies
over a 15-year period and to include a risk premium in the discount rate it
applied to calculate the benefit of certain subsidies.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Foreign groups 'should get' US research funds
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>

US subsidiaries of foreign companies should be made eligible for millions of
dollars of US government research and development funds if they can prove
their work is beneficial to the US technology base, a congressional report
suggests.
The report, multinationals and the US technology base, released yesterday by
the office of technology assessment, said 'a national benefits test' could
be applied equally to both foreign and domestic companies, consistent with
the principle of national treatment which underlies the world trading
system.
With the report, the OTA enters an debate over whether subsidiaries of
foreign companies, which contribute to the US economy by employing American
workers, ought to benefit from government funding and trade promotion
activities.
The OTA suggested several criteria for the participation of foreign
companies in US technology projects, including:
Measuring a subsidiary's research and development presence in the US,
perhaps as a percentage of sales.
Requiring specific technological and financial contributions for the
project.
Requiring a company to conduct all the project's R&amp;D (or a negotiated
percentage) in the US.
Agreeing not to license the technology abroad, but to export products
resulting from the R&amp;D.
The European-American chamber of commerce, which has been pushing a
multilateral investment pact among the industrialised countries, announced
its support for the proposal. 'It would be even more useful for such a test
to be formulated jointly with our European partners, yielding a test that
would apply equally to European and US companies on either side of the
Atlantic,' said Mr Willard Berry, president of the group.
The chamber attacked another suggestion in the report that the US also
consider 'a two-tiered policy regime' which would treat foreign-owned
companies the same as US companies on the condition that home governments
offer comparable treatment and market access.
'Conditional national treatment is a dangerous precedent because the
conditional can be completely unrelated and arbitrary,' said Mr Berry. The
report said 'reciprocity' requirements could 'increase tensions in
international relations, leading to a variety of retaliatory actions.'
The Organisation of International Investment (Ofii), which represents
foreign companies that invest in the US, said the US gained from foreign
technology development when it allowed foreign-owned companies to
participate in US government-funded technology projects.
'If foreign-owned US companies are held hostage to the trade and investment
practices of their home countries, the US would be building a wall around
itself,' said Ms Nancy McLernon, of Ofii.

FT  19 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Where politics is a commercial break
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN DIEGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
By most counts, Ms Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for governor of
California, 'won' her televised debate with Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican
incumbent, last Friday night. For once, she seemed confident, he came over
as ungracious and she probably scored among women voters by effectively
rebutting his charges that she did not care about the victims of violent
crime with the disclosure that her daughter had been raped and her son
mugged.
If candidate debates were all there were to winning elections, Ms Brown
might have reason to believe she was at last on her way to reducing the
13-point lead Mr Wilson has accumulated among likely voters in the latest
Los Angeles Times poll. Even the fact that he agreed to only one debate and
ensured it was broadcast only in Friday evening 'drive-time' were acceptable
conditions given Ms Brown's need to energise her supporters.
But across the country, and especially in big mass media states such as
California, political campaigns prefer to leave as little as possible on the
air waves to chance. Instead they buy the time and plug their own messages,
secure in the calculation that six out of 10 Americans, and no fewer than
nine out of 10 Californians, to whom television is a particular addiction,
will be paying some attention.
Virtually all of them have only one intent - to tear down the opposition.
For a week California has enjoyed an unrelenting diet, from breakfast to the
small hours, through soap operas and Monday night football, of lies, damn
lies and highly suspect statistics.
Unedifying it may be, and costly it certainly is, but it can pay quick, if
not necessarily ultimate, dividends. Republican Congressman Michael
Huffington has already forked out a record Dollars 12m-plus to undermine
California Senator Dianne Feinstein and will probably double that by
election day on November 8.
That brought him from obscurity to near parity, though his surge now seems
to have been stemmed and Ms Feinstein holds a seven-point lead. But this has
been less the result of her vicious counter-attacks than national and local
media attention on his record and the New Age associations of his wife, the
former Arianna Stassinopoulos, considered odd even by Californian standards.
The basic Huffington message is, according to an especially ubiquitous
commercial, 'Feinstein - a career politician who will say or do anything to
stay in office.' She is also 'slimy' (a quote from a local newspaper) and
given to brokering 'sweetheart deals' in Congress that favour her unnamed
'supporters'.
Even when the Republican's commercials are notionally positive - one
concludes dreamily 'Michael Huffington, US Senate. Finally a reason to
believe' - the voice-overs disclose nothing that he actually believes in,
except no new taxes.
Ms Feinstein, who has a serious record to run on in the Senate and as mayor
of San Francisco, does not confine herself to the high road. One of her
commercials, quoting an old story in the Wall Street Journal, charges that
Mr Huffington's company 'repeatedly sold illegal shock batons to foreign
dictators' (Singapore, as it turns out, which may restrict any Asian travel
plans she has in mind). It does not try to explain the relevance of this to
the voters of modern California.
Her latest refined commercial pitch is to depict Mr Huffington as 'the Texas
millionaire California can't trust'. This slogan, together with graphics
featuring lots of dollars, manages to embrace his wealth, the charge that he
delayed establishing legal residence in California for tax purposes, and
even a congressional record of alleged big spending.
Mr Wilson and Ms Brown have been little better. On capital punishment he
tars her indiscriminately with guilt by familial association by recalling
that her father and brother, both previous governors, opposed the death
penalty.
Her commercials quite blatantly distort his budget battles of two years ago
in the depths of the recession, replete with a black and white mugshot of
the governor that might have been taken from an FBI 'most wanted' list.
One reason for Mr Wilson's lead is his support for, and her opposition to,
Proposition 187, the 'save our state' referendum on the November 8 ballot
that would deny a wide range of state-provided social services to illegal
immigrants.
It is a serious issue, involving federal and state responsibilities, worthy
of serious consideration and both actually agree that even if it passes, as
the polls say it will easily, it will end up eventually in the US Supreme
Court.
Writing in the San Diego Union-Tribune this week, Mr Robert Laurence
suspects that all these smear campaigns are basically intended to turn the
larger public off politics, with only the fervent minorities bothering to
vote. 'And that,' he concludes sadly, 'tells you what the candidates
themselves really think of the American democratic process.'

FT  19 OCT 94 / Washington seeks tougher line on mergers overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US anti-trust enforcement agencies have issued new international guidelines
asserting their right to act against a broad range of anti-competitive
mergers or corporate behaviour overseas.
The guidelines were issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the
Federal Trade Commission for a 60-day comment period and replace rules
issued in 1988, under President Ronald Reagan, which shielded most foreign
companies and joint ventures between US and foreign companies from US
anti-trust enforcement, unless they affected US consumers.
In the draft, the Clinton administration confirms a 1992 policy reversal
under which action may be taken against foreign anti-competitive behaviour
that affects US exporters as well as consumers.
The Justice Department earlier this year launched its first case under the
new policy against Pilkington, the UK glass company, and anti-trust lawyers
say the department is investigating allegations of pressure applied to
buyers by the Japanese plate glass industry.
This investigation could bolster the US trade representative's efforts to
get Japan to open up its glass market, but could also provoke an
international battle over the extension of US jurisdiction beyond its
borders.
The guidelines also 'take a broader view of anti-trust jurisdiction
involving imports than the 1988 guidelines', the Justice Department said.
Reflecting a 1993 Supreme Court decision in a case between Hartford Fire
Insurance and California, the guidelines say that the US may act against a
foreign cartel that colludes to raise prices, if the cartel members make
substantial sales to the US.
US efforts to assert its anti-trust jurisdiction overseas caused
considerable friction in the 1970s. Countries such as Canada, France and the
UK even passed laws prohibiting companies from supplying documents to the US
in retaliation for US action against a uranium cartel.
The guidelines say that there may be less conflict between US and foreign
anti-trust interests as 'more countries adopt anti-trust or competition laws
that are compatible with those of the US'.
In pursuing a foreign cartel, they say, the Justice Department and the FTC
'would ordinarily notify the anti-trust authority in the cartel's home
country.'
'If that authority were in a better position to address the competitive
problem, and were prepared to take effective action to address the adverse
effects on US commerce, the agencies would consider working co-operatively
with the foreign authority or staying their own remedy pending enforcement
efforts by the foreign country,' according to the guidelines.
The guidelines say the Justice Department and FTC will follow the principle
of comity, under which countries respect one another's legal acts, but
insist that the administration's determination on the application of comity
cannot be challenged in the courts.

FT  19 OCT 94 / North Korea nuclear deal eases fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>

   SEOUL, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International fears over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme
abated yesterday in the wake of a deal that will open the country to
inspections and improve ties with the US.
The pact is a sign that Mr Kim Jong-il, North Korea's new leader, is
prepared to broaden his country's international contacts. It raised hopes he
will speed opening the country to foreign investment.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the agreement 'goes a
long way' to removing a potential North Korean nuclear threat'.
In Washington last night, President Bill Clinton described the agreement 'as
good for the US, good for our allies and good for the safety of the entire
world'. The deal 'represents the first step on the road to a nuclear-free
(Korean) peninsula'.
Mr Clinton said he was instructing Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US
delegation in the tortuous negotiation, to sign the accord in Geneva on
Friday as scheduled. Mr Gallucci announced the breakthrough in talks with
North Korean officials at midnight on Monday, saying the agreement had to be
referred back to respective governments for approval.
Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister and head of the
delegation to the Geneva talks, said the planned replacement of North
Korea's existing graphite-moderated nuclear reactor programme with
light-water reactor technology would 'completely eliminate and dispel'
suspicions about Pyongyang's alleged development of nuclear weapons.
The agreement is linked to the gradual improvement of bilateral relations
between Washington and Pyongyang, which, Mr Kang said, would 'make a
significant contribution to greater security in Asia and the rest of the
world'.
The deal apparently provides for a delay in inspections by the International
Atomic Energy Agency to determine whether North Korea has reprocessed
plutonium for nuclear weapons. South Korean officials had expressed concern
that such a delay would give Pyongyang more time to produce a bomb from
plutonium it is suspected of reprocessing five years ago.
There were also doubts in Seoul about providing North Korea with
international aid that could revive its troubled economy when it appears to
be heading towards collapse. But officials yesterday acknowledged they had
little choice but to accept the accord concluded by the US, South Korea's
main military and economic ally.
The agreement, however, contains several advantages for South Korea,
including securing a foothold in the North through the supply of safe
light-water reactors to Pyongyang. North Korea made a last-minute compromise
to secure the deal by agreeing to resume talks with Seoul on the
de-nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
Officials said Seoul is preparing to relax restrictions on investments by
South Korean companies in the North if the agreement proceeds smoothly.
Mr Han indicated that Pyongyang may have been anxious to reach an agreement
with the US on the nuclear issue because it would boost the prestige of Mr
Kim Jong-il before he formally takes over the leadership of North Korea in
the next several weeks.
North Korea has achieved several long-sought goals under the deal, including
improved ties with the US and provision of energy supplies that could
reverse its economic decline.

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China and the US have agreed to increase the frequency of their military
consultations in a further sign of improving relations.
The move follows the decision by President Bill Clinton earlier this year to
sever the link between human rights issues and renewal of China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status.
Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said in Beijing that the two sides
would enhance their military contacts in regular high-level briefings to
begin next month. The US would lead the way in providing the Chinese with
the briefings. 'Dialogue is in the security interests of both countries,' Mr
Perry said. Washington has been pressing the Chinese military to become less
secretive.
The US has also offered the Chinese data from computer simulations of its
nuclear tests. The purpose has been to persuade the Chinese to stop carrying
out tests. Beijing has refused to join a Washington-sponsored moratorium on
testing but says it is committed to a comprehensive test ban when this comes
into effect in 1996.
Mr Perry called on China to exercise restraint in the transfer of nuclear
technology. The US has long suspected Beijing of helping Pakistan to develop
a nuclear capability.

                  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1991:             North, under mounting pressure, says it will allow
                  inspection as soon as US begins removing nuclear
                  weapons from South Korea; South declares there no

                  agree to ban nuclear weapons and hold talks to
                  ensure compliance.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1992:             North signs safeguards agreement; IAEA says after
                  visit to Yongbyon complex that North is moving
                  ahead with programme that could produce weapons-grade
                  plutonium.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, Jan-May:    Talks between two Koreas on mutual inspections
                  collapses; North says it will pull out of
                  NPT; IAEA rules North has violated nuclear accords;
                  UN Security Council calls on North to open
                  sites; US and North agree to talk.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, June-Nov:   North agrees to suspend withdrawal from NPT and to
                  renew talks with IAEA; inspectors report that access
                  to two sites still restricted; North says it will
                  not yield and is prepared to suffer sanctions or even
                  war.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994, Jan-May:    After further talks with US, North agrees to
                  inspection of seven declared sites; South says
                  North hampering inspectors at Yongbyon and North,
                  saying confrontation could lead to war, walks out
                  of meeting with South; US decides to deploy Patriot

FT  19 OCT 94 / A pact shaped in distrust: The US-North Korea nuclear accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the US and North Korea sign their nuclear agreement on Friday, it will
set in motion a train of events that could last almost a decade before the
dispute is completely settled.
The goal is to remove suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme while
breaking Pyongyang's diplomatic isolation and providing it with much-needed
economic aid in the form of new nuclear reactors and other energy supplies.
The accord consists of phased steps designed to provide each side with
leverage to make sure that the other adheres to its promises. This reflects
the deep mutual distrust which exists between the US and North Korea and
which prevented an agreement being reached earlier.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, yesterday described the
agreement as a combination of steps in an 'incremental process'.
The elements of the deal, details of which will be announced on Friday,
include North Korea abandoning its nuclear programme and accepting full
international inspections of its nuclear facilities in return for improved
ties with the US and economic aid. Pyongyang also promises to resume
negotiations with South Korea on the implementation of their 1991
non-nuclear pact.
Many pitfalls lie along the way, with parts of the carefully calibrated
timetable remaining unclear.
The first steps are likely in the next month or two. They include North
Korea returning to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and accepting ad hoc
and regular inspections at its Yongbyon nuclear complex from the
International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea threatened to withdraw from
the NPT in March 1993 and later 'suspended' its treaty obligations, which
provoked its confrontation with the US and South Korea.
At the same time, North Korea will freeze its programme. This includes
suspending the operation of its 5MW graphite reactor and halting
construction of two larger 50MW and 200MW reactors, which can produce
considerable amounts of weapons-grade plutonium. It will also close its
suspected nuclear reprocessing centre. All these facilities are later to be
dismantled.
North Korea will place in dry storage spent fuel that it withdrew from its
5MW reactor last spring. The fuel, which could produce enough plutonium for
four or five nuclear bombs, will later be transferred to a third country for
reprocessing.
But Pyongyang will only accept at a later stage special inspections by the
IAEA to determine if it had reprocessed plutonium for one or two nuclear
bombs in 1989. The IAEA wants to examine two undeclared nuclear waste dumps
to answer this question.
The special inspection demand triggered North Korea's threatened withdrawal
from the NPT and lies at the core of the dispute. North Korea may only allow
the special inspections once equipment for new and safer light-water
reactors is delivered over the next several years, but before they are
completely built.
North Korea has agreed to resume negotiations with South Korea on their 1991
de-nuclearisation treaty. However, South Korea is demanding inspections that
are more intrusive than those to be conducted by the IAEA, and prospects for
those talks remain uncertain.
Disagreements over South Korea's demand for spot or challenge inspections of
suspected nuclear facilities in the North led to the breakdown of the talks
in 1992.
In return for the North Korean concessions, the US has offered several
promises. They include a guarantee to provide North Korea with two 1,000MW
light-water reactors and alternative energy supplies while they are being
constructed during the next decade. This would help solve North Korea's
chronic energy shortage, which has been one of the main reasons for its
declining economy.
The light-water reactors are dependent on imported enriched uranium for
fuel, making it easier for the US and other countries to maintain control
over the future North Korean nuclear programme. They also produce plutonium
less suitable for the manufacturing of atomic weapons. The current graphite
reactors use uranium mined in North Korea.
The light-water reactors will be supplied by an international consortium,
probably led by the US. But the reactors are expected to be built by South
Korean companies using a Westinghouse design. Seoul will also provide the
bulk of the financing for the Dollars 4bn project, although contributions
are also expected from Japan and other countries, according to Mr Han.
In the meantime, North Korea will start receiving heavy fuel oil fuel
supplies from an international consortium to replace energy lost from the
shutdown of the graphite reactors.
The US has also promised to improve ties with North Korea by establishing
liaison offices. It is also expected to ease its trade embargo against North
Korea and possibly offer a pledge not to launch a nuclear attack against
North Korea, a guarantee Pyongyang has long sought.
However, the pace of US-North Korean negotiations may be determined by
progress in the inter-Korean talks, although Mr Han said there were 'not
one-to-one preconditional constraints' between the two.
South Korean has insisted on linking the resumption of inter-Korean talks
with the US-North Korean accord out of concern that Pyongyang is trying to
drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington on the nuclear issue.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Syria rules out Jordan-style deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Syria yesterday flatly ruled out an Israeli proposal to craft a peace
agreement between the two neighbouring states based on Israel's landmark
treaty with Jordan involving exchange of land and lease-back deals.
President Hafez al-Assad, holding surprise talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Cairo last night, reaffirmed Syria's demand for a full
Israeli withdrawal from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and said it would
be blasphemy to lease Arab land to Israel. Mr Assad said anyone who thought
Syria would accept such a model was 'shamefully wrong' and adoption of this
strategy by Israel would lead to the opposite of peace 'even if we live tens
or hundreds of years'.
Mr Assad's comments came after Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister,
said he hoped territorial exchange between Israel and Jordan might set a
precedent for peace talks with Syria over the return of the Golan, home to
14,000 Jewish settlers and many businesses. Under the Israel-Jordan peace
treaty initialled in Amman on Monday Israel will return to Jordan more than
300sq km of occupied territory. In addition Jordan agreed to accept 30sq km
of Israeli land in exchange for Jordanian territory being farmed by Israelis
and to lease back at least a further 700 acres for 25 years with an option
to renew. President Mubarak, who has welcomed the Israeli-Jordanian
agreement, also cast doubt on leasing Arab land to Israel, saying 'land is
honour'. More criticism against the Israeli-Jordanian agreement came
yesterday from Palestinian radical groups based in Damascus and from the
extremist Islamic Hamas group, which said the accord favours 'the occupation
enemy and contradicts our legitimate Palestinian and Arab rights'.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation also attacked the treaty's allocation
of a special role to Jordan as the guardian of Islamic holy sites in Arab
East Jerusalem, saying it was a 'flagrant violation' the PLO-Israeli
agreements and an attempt to legitimise Israeli occupation of the holy city.
The statement confirmed mounting PLO-Jordanian tension over the rival claims
to Arab East Jerusalem.
In Israel, however, the treaty was received with near euphoria. Israeli
newspapers lauded Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin as a great man and even
ultra-right-wing parties praised the agreement, which appeared to involve no
significant Israeli sacrifices.
Mr Dan Proper, head of the Israeli Manufacturers' Association, said the move
marked a 'big swing forward' for Israel in trade with the world, access to
foreign investment and participation in large regional infrastructure
projects.
Tourism officials forecast large gains to both economies, with at least
1,000 tourists a day crossing between Israel and Jordan.
Arkia, a small airline company, announced it would start two flights a day
between Amman and Tel Aviv and another company plans to offer a helicopter
and limousine service for businessmen. Plans were also unveiled yesterday
for an Israeli-Jordanian joint venture to construct a tourism project in the
Arava desert.
Israeli optimism has been buoyed by President Bill Clinton's decision to
attend next Wednesday's signing ceremony at the new border crossing between
the Red Sea twin cities of Aqaba and Eilat.

China has signalled that it wants to speed the entry of foreign companies
into the country's rapidly-growing insurance market. Speedier consideration
of applications for joint ventures involving foreign insurance companies is
been actively sought by the People's Bank of China, which regulates the
insurance industry. Mr Di Weiping, deputy director of the bank's
international department, told a conference in Hong Kong that, despite
growing rapidly, China's insurance industry 'cannot meet the needs of the
country's economic development'. For international insurance groups, the
Chinese market offers potentially vast opportunities: between 1992 and 1993
income from premiums in China increased by more than 40 per cent. But only a
handful of foreign insurance companies have made in-roads into the Chinese
market.

<TEXT>
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the Japanese finance minister, said yesterday he
believes a proposed revision of the country's securities trading tax should
be considered as part of an overall review of the securities tax system.
Speaking in the Japanese parliament, Mr Takemura said a review would also
cover a proposed increase in capital gains tax. But he said that a full
review of the tax was unlikely before 1996. Alone among the leading
international capital markets, Japan currently imposes a 0.3 per cent tax on
all securities transactions. But in the last year, as equity trading has
remained sluggish and foreign companies have de-listed from the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, alarm has been expressed about che damage done by the tax to
Japan's market.

Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,

Seven opposition to his plan for the fund to provide more financial aid to
developing countries, he said yesterday. In a briefing at the end of a

negotiations on the proposed assistance scheme 'will come to a successful
conclusion'. He had proposed the IMF create SDR50bn (Pounds 53bn), that
could be tapped for developing economies encountering serious external
payments problems. The Camdessus proposal was rejected by the Group of Seven
industrial nations at the IMF-World Bank meetings in Madrid early this
month.

<TEXT>
Nigeria's military government yesterday sacked the finance minister, Mr Kalu
Idika Kalu, architect of the country's suspended economic liberalisation
policy and leader of a lobby for deregulation. Mr Kalu's sacking was
reported in the government-owned Daily Times newspaper. There was no
official announcement and no reason given. No replacement has been named.
His dismissal may be part of a reshuffle in which the ruler, General Sani
Abacha, has fired senior military officers. In 1986, Mr Kalu negotiated with
the World Bank and introduced stringent reforms, opening the way for new
loans and debt rescheduling. He was a lone voice for free market policies in
a civilian cabinet at first dominated by supporters of government regulation
of the economy. He then became sidelined by the increased role of the
military since Gen Abacha seized power last November. In January Mr Kalu had
to present a 1994 budget that contradicted his own policy prescriptions and
ended Nigeria's eight-year experiment with structural adjustment.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Japan under pressure on Iranian dam: US and Israel oppose
Dollars 1bn funding because of Tehran's alleged terrorist links
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan has come under pressure from the US and Israel to stop funding a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 620m) hydroelectric dam in Iran, because of claims that
the Iranian government has terrorist links.
Japan's Foreign Ministry has been urged to decide against disbursing an
overdue second Dollars 460m tranche of a soft loan for the dam, over the
Karun river, south of Tehran. It is the latest of four hydroelectric plants,
an important part of efforts to update an inadequate power supply, the
success of which is crucial to economic reforms.
Criticism of Japan's support for Iran risks embarrassing the Tokyo
government, the world's largest aid donor, less than a month after its
application for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council.
Japan has based its UN application on its credentials as a supporter of
humanitarian causes across the world.
Diplomatic pressure to stop helping Iran has built up in recent weeks
because the Foreign Ministry is nearing a decision on the loan. The second
tranche was due to have been paid in May, but has been delayed while the
ministry studied its allies' evidence of Iran's terrorist links.
The first tranche, worth Dollars 364m and paid in May 1993, was for
engineering and consultancy costs, while the second is to pay for machinery.
A final tranche is for construction, yet to start. The Japanese government's
approval for the Karun project last year marked a controversial end, against
US opposition, to a 17-year suspension of Japanese aid to Iran. This is
among several subjects on which Japan has started recently to sketch out a
foreign policy line independent of Washington.
Last year's U-turn in Tokyo's Iranian policy, influenced by Mr Kunihiko
Saito, the foreign ministry's bureaucratic chief and a former ambassador to
Iran, is intended to support moderate elements in the Tehran government.
This will help political stability in the Gulf region, on which Japan
depends for more than half its oil supplies, argue the ministry's Middle
East experts. Iran alone provides a mere 8.4 per cent of Japanese oil.
Critics of Japan's support for Iran, including some sections in the ministry
itself, argue that it produces the opposite effect to that intended. They
maintain that President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's pragmatic
president, is aware of and unalarmed by CIA reports showing Iranian backing
for the Hizbollah bomb attacks in Buenos Aires and London in July and claims
by Mossad, Israeli intelligence, that aid to Iran is being diverted to
Hamas, the extremist Islamic group.
Moreover, UK intelligence reports earlier this year demonstrated links
between Tehran and the Irish Republican Army, so arousing British concern
over the possible diversion of Japanese aid.
Japan's Foreign Ministry is, however, sensitive to these allegations. It has
at least once since restarting aid to Iran hinted that official loans would
be withdrawn if it found conclusive evidence that Tehran supported
terrorism, built nuclear weapons or expanded its military. Officials do not
deny that the Iranian government's pragmatists and extreme religious groups
are close to each other.
Against that, a ministry official points to encouragingly moderate recent
statements from Tehran that it will not obstruct the Middle East peace
process and that it has shifted its support for North over South Korea to
neutrality between the two.
Whether or not to proceed with the loan remains under study, the official
said.

FT  19 OCT 94 / NTT in row over use of network
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A private Japanese telecommunications carrier has asked the country's
regulatory authorities to intervene in what has become an unusually public
row with NTT, the former public utility, over use of its local network.
Japan Telecom, the country's third largest long-distance carrier, yesterday
asked the minister of posts and telecommunications to order NTT to make its
local network available for high-speed data services Japan Telecom is
seeking to offer.
The appeal, which highlights the increasingly competitive market environment
in Japan, could strengthen the argument for breaking up NTT (last week
listed on the London Stock Exchange) into separate long-distance and local
operations.
NTT has been accused by critics of using its local network monopoly to
impede competition in the long-distance network. Japan Telecom said it had
been in talks with NTT for two years in an attempt to link its long-distance
network with NTT's local network, to provide frame relay services letting
users cut the cost of sending data down phone lines.
As a long-distance carrier, Japan Telecom must use the local network
dominated by NTT to provide such services. While talks between the two
companies failed to bear fruit for Japan Telecom, NTT applied in July this
year to offer frame relay services of its own. NTT, which on privatisation
was allowed to retain both long-distance and local networks, faces a
decision next year on whether it should be broken up or allowed to operate
intact.
If the minister decides to order NTT to make its local network available to
competitors, it will be the first time the authorities will have done so.
NTT has two weeks to bring its case to the authorities. NTT said it was
ready to continue talks.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Greens set to help shape the German agenda: Michael
Lindemann charts the radicals' return to parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Greens are back - and not just by the skin of their teeth but, with 49
seats, as the third strongest party in Germany's federal parliament.
That gives the left-wing environmentalists the right to appoint one of the
parliament's four deputy speakers and gives them access to other committees
which shape the parliamentary agenda.
They celebrated longer than anybody else on Sunday night but were yesterday
holed up in a hotel outside Bonn reviewing their strategy for the next four
years, sure they will be able to build on their success.
'I think you'll see us winning the sort of support that we got in the
European elections next time round,' said Ms Anne Nilges, the party
spokeswoman, referring to the result in June when the party won 10.1 per
cent of the vote.
Four years ago the Greens scored just 3.8 per cent. They lost voters to the
Social Democratic party which had shifted leftwards and they lost their 44
seats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.
Other parties have meanwhile taken up many of the environmental policies
mooted by the Greens, but the party says it will remain on the environmental
offensive and can turn environmental concerns that stretch across German
society into more votes at the next election.
The Greens will work together with the SPD, with whom they had hoped to form
a so-called red-green coalition government, but have few fears of having the
ground stolen from beneath them. 'The SPD is much more likely to move to the
right as it tries to become the ruling party,' Ms Nilges said.
Mr Joschka Fischer, the former environment minister in the state of Hesse
who hopes to become one of the two leaders of the parliamentary party, set
the tone for the new party when he faced the cameras on Sunday night after
the election.
He first saw action in the Bundestag 10 years ago when he was scruffily
dressed and wore trainers. Ten years ago to the day he was expelled from
parliament for rowdy behaviour and on leaving called the acting speaker of
the Bundestag an 'arsehole'.
Mr Fischer now wears a tie, but it is still poorly knotted and his top
button is still undone.
The party now faces competition of a different sort. The party of Democratic
Socialism, the renamed east German communist party, has no impressive
environmental credentials but it has proved that it can steal radical votes
from the Greens.
Four years ago just 0.3 per cent of west German voters backed the PDS. This
time 0.9 per cent plumped for the PDS in the west, many of them one-time
Green voters who were disappointed that the Greens were ready to tone down
their revolutionary agenda to form a coalition with the SPD.
The Greens appear to have made decisive inroads into the support of the Free
Democratic party, the small liberal coalition partner of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
The Greens also won seats in the state parliament in the Saarland, the small
south-western state, and were able to bolster their presence in councils
across North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, where their
share of the vote jumped from 7.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent.
The Greens' biggest problem remains eastern Germany where it picked up just
5 per cent of the vote. It has been unable to get its environmental message
across to people who, leading Greens admit, have more everyday concerns.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Kohl pressed on plans for spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's newly re-elected government came under strong pressure yesterday
from industry and the Bundesbank to stick to its plans for spending cuts and
take strong action to reform the costly social welfare system.
'The burden of the welfare state will crush us if we fail to act,' said Mr
Klaus Murmann, president of the German Employers' Federation. The steadily
growing system of social benefits could no longer be financed in its present
form - 'our main demand to the government and parliament is, therefore, to
restructure the welfare state.'
Mr Murmann said Germany's competitiveness had to be improved by reducing
social security costs. He said total social expenditure - on sickness and
accident insurance, pensions, unemployment and welfare benefits - was
DM1,060bn (Pounds 434.4bn) in 1993, 50 per cent more than Germany's capital
investment. In 1970, they had been roughly equal at some DM170bn.
His proposals included a reduction in initial sickness pay and review of the
pension system. Social insurance should be for the needy and people should
be more prepared to make their own provision rather than relying on the
state.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, warned the government
against relying on the accelerating upturn in the economy to solve the
country's long-term problems. 'The structural crisis of the German economy
will take time to overcome. It will not be solved by the economic recovery.'
Mr Tietmeyer did not mention the election result but it was clear both he
and Mr Murmann were anxious that the narrowness of the government's majority
might deter it from tough measures. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition
party, won fewer seats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament,
while the opposition Social Democrats lifted their majority in the
Bundesrat, the upper house, which can delay legislation.
One of Mr Tietmeyer's main concerns is that too much federal borrowing could
push up interest rates on the bond market. He warned against a 'crowding
out' situation - in which heavy demand for funds pushes up rates - at a time
of incipient economic recovery.
Too much of the government's efforts to curb the budget deficit had
concentrated on raising taxes and welfare contributions, he said. More
effort should be devoted to cuts in spending.
A further salvo towards Bonn was fired by Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company. He said the government
should find the courage to tell people of the need to tackle 'a pile of
unpopular tasks', including plans to reduce spending.

Mrs Tansu Ciller, Turkish prime minister, has convinced her cabinet's
biggest opponent of privatisation to back a draft framework law on state
asset sales, significantly increasing the chances that parliament will enact
it. Mr Mumtaz Soysal, foreign minister, a member of her coalition
government's junior partner, the Social Democratic party, signed the draft
law on Monday night after obstructing privatisation for months. He demanded
that Mrs Ciller adopt a political liberalisation package before backing
privatisation. Earlier this year he won a constitutional court appeal
against her plan to impose privatisation by decree. The government still
hopes to raise Dollars 1bn this year from privatisation and a further
Dollars 9bn-Dollars 12bn next year. The state telephone and electricity
utilities as well as five banks, the national airline, manufacturing and oil
refining businesses are to be sold. State companies lost Dollars 5.6bn last
year. Privatisation is a key feature of a wider World Bank-supported public
sector reform programme aimed at tackling the main causes of the
government's big budget deficits and Turkey's high inflation.

Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency and the economics ministry may be
forced to reduce by DM250m (Pounds 103m) the planned DM1.2bn rescue package
for Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's steel mill, European Commission officials
said yesterday. But any reduction of subsidies could throw into jeopardy the
sale of the plant to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producer, which has
agreed in principle to buy for DM30m a 60 per cent stake in Eko Stahl. It
also intends to invest DM440m in modernising the steel mill's existing blast
furnace and building a new hot-rolling mill. Cockerill yesterday said 'it
would not take Eko Stahl at any price', adding that the agreement to buy a
stake in the mill was linked to the large rescue package. 'It is up to the
Treuhand to negotiate with the European Commission,' it said. If Cockerill
is not prepared to renegotiate the rescue package, the Treuhand might allow
it to buy the remaining 40 per cent stake for a token DM1 in order to make
up for any reduction in the rescue package.

<TEXT>
The muddle over results in the first round of Macedonia's presidential and
parliamentary elections, still unresolved more than 48 hours after the polls
closed, is creating confusion among voters and increasing anger in
opposition political parties. The electoral commission, headed by a
constitutional court judge, which supervised Sunday's presidential and
parliamentary vote, yesterday cited 'technical difficulties' for not being
able to announce results from as many as 83 out of 120 constituencies in the
former Yugoslav republic.
According to unofficial returns, President Kiro Gligorov, seeking
re-election through a direct vote, held a commanding lead over his
nationalist challenger, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, while the governing
Alliance for Macedonia claimed its candidates were ahead in more than half
the constituencies. But the prolonged delay in producing official results is
likely to reduce support for the Alliance at the run-off poll on October 30.
Both the main opposition Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, the
hardline nationalist party, and the free-market nationalist Democratic party
set up last year have complained of ballot box fraud and are threatening to
boycott the second round of the elections.

Mr Joep van den Nieuwenhuyzen, chairman of the Dutch engineering group
Begemann, said yesterday that he was stepping down temporarily while he
pursued an appeal against his conviction for insider trading. Mr van den
Nieuwenhuyzen, the first person in the Netherlands to be found guilty of
insider trading, said he was vacating the top job in favour of Mr Andre
Deleye. On Monday, Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen was sentenced to six months in
jail, with three months suspended, and fined Fl 100,000 (Pounds 36,900) for
insider trading in the shares of HCS, a now bankrupt computer company. He is
free pending his appeal.
In 1991, Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen, one of HCS's main shareholders, sold 4.1m
shares in the company the morning after he attended a meeting with bankers
and other big shareholders to discuss a rescue plan. He had acknowledged
'share orchestration' but denied insider trading. His appeal to the supreme
court could take a year or a longer. Mr van den Nieuwenhuyzen's conviction
on Monday reversed his acquittal by a lower court in April.

France's main public works companies - with the exception of one of the
largest, Bouygues - have foresworn using illegal payments to win contracts
or orders, in an attempt to restore public confidence in their sector. At
the initiative of their trade association, the companies, which include
subsidiaries of Lyonnaise des Eaux, Compagnie Generale des Eaux and the
Schneider engineering group, have signed a pledge that they will obey the
law on corporate contributions to political parties and candidates.
Bouygues, which happens to have figured less in recent corruption
allegations, yesterday questioned the need for such a pledge with its
implication of possible past wrong-doing. Meanwhile, Alcatel CIT yesterday
described as 'absurd' a reported estimate by an investigating magistrate
that the telecommunications company had in fact overcharged France Telecom
for equipment by up to FFr2bn, way in excess of the FFr62.6m which Alcatel
recently paid the telephone utility in an agreed settlement.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italian industrial production surged during the normally static month of
August, rising 16 per cent on the same period in 1993. However, the August
figures are not considered truly comparative because of the adoption of more
staggered holiday closures by factories during the summer holidays this
year. The rise in industrial production lifted the increase in the first
eight months to 3.7 per cent over the same period last year, according to
Istat, the national statistics institute. The most spectacular increase has
been the 145 per cent jump in car production over 1993, reversing the
decline that set in three years ago. Other sectors growing fast are
electrical goods (up 41 per cent), shoe manufacture (up 36 per cent) and
plastics (up 34 per cent).
Poland's industrial output (unadjusted) rose 3.5 per cent in September and
was 16.7 per cent higher than in September 1993, the central statistical
office said.
Switzerland recorded a trade surplus of SFr169.1m (Pounds 84.5m) in
September after a revised deficit of SFr288.7m in August, the federal
customs office said.
Finnish industry's producer price index rose 0.2 per cent month-on-month in
September and the year-on-year rise was 2.1 per cent, Statistics Finland
said.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Spanish financier detained on fraud charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Javier de la Rosa, one of Spain's richest and best known businessmen, was
yesterday detained pending formal charges in Barcelona, prompting
speculation that his arrest on charges of fraud could prompt an
Italian-style political fallout.
Earlier Mr de la Rosa, who was at the centre of major deals during the
booming late 1980s in Spain, had defiantly threatened those seeking his
downfall. 'Everyone had better be prepared to take their share of
responsibility,' the financier told a radio interviewer, 'Those who have put
this process in motion haven't a clue what the consequences could be.'
Meanwhile in Madrid, Mr Mario Conde, removed as chairman of Banesto, the big
domestic retail bank, by the Bank of Spain at the end of last year, was
questioned yesterday by the chief investigative judge dealing with fiscal
offences over alleged bribes paid by the bank in order to obtain tax breaks.
Mr Conde faces several investigations following the move by the Bank of
Spain, which believed he had brought Banesto close to collapse.
Mr de la Rosa is accused of misappropriation of public funds in connection
with credits, guaranteed by Catalonia's Generalitat government, that were
granted to his loss-making holding company Gran Tibidabo.
He is best known for spearheading large investments in Spain by the Kuwait
Investment Office and is being separately sued by the office over losses
that forced the Spanish companies it controlled into receivership two years
ago.
His arrest has already prompted opposition calls for the resignation of
senior members of the Generalitat which had recently blocked an
investigation by Catalonia's regional parliament into Mr de la Rosa's
affairs.
The development is very embarrassing for Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan
nationalist leader and President of the Generalitat, who has consistently
backed Mr de la Rosa. The political consequences could extend also to Mr
Felipe Gonzalez's government in Madrid which depends on the support of Mr
Pujol and the Catalan nationalists to stay in power.
Mr Gonzalez yesterday distanced himself from the events saying he did not
intend to 'lose any sleep' over Mr de la Rosa's arrest. Referring to the
fortunes that were made in Spain in the late 1980s, the prime minister said
the times of a 'speculative' economy were over.
Mr de la Rosa and former Banesto chairman Mr Conde were the emblematic
winners of Spain's recent economic boom and both were close to the political
establishment in Madrid and Barcelona.
Conservative opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar said that Mr Gonzalez,
who has been in power since 1982, had 'sown the seeds of corruption' and
that the prime minister would be forced to 'reap the harvest'.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Job battle marked by personality conflicts: Robert Graham in
Rome charts the course of a bitter five-month wrangle that has inflicted
deep wounds on both sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The conflict between Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government and the Bank of Italy
over nominating a new director-general for the central bank has left only
losers. The dispute was resolved yesterday with the naming of Mr Vincenzo
Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors, to take over the second
most important post in the Bank of Italy. But the wounds run so deep on both
sides they may not heal within the life of the current administration.
The five-month long wrangle over the appointment - with the issue of the
bank's autonomy at stake - has also damaged Italy's credibility in the
financial markets. When a European government falls out with the central
bank over the composition of the latter's key directorate, it looks as
though serious differences of economic and monetary policy are at issue.
These differences do exist. In an economy experiencing a strong recovery and
with a huge public debt, the Berlusconi government wants interest rates to
fall; the Bank of Italy is concerned to protect the currency and hold down
inflation. The government was critical of a decision by Mr Antonio Fazio,
the governor, to raise the discount rate in mid-August by half a percentage
point, and was furious he observed his governor's charter to the letter,
informing of the move only when it was decided.
However, conflicts of personality have played a big role in this case as Mr
Fazio has fought to preserve the bank's autonomy with the choice of an
internal candidate.
The seeds of disagreement were sown in April 1993 when Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi agreed to leave the governorship of the bank to become prime
minister. Having been governor since 1979, he had clear ideas about the
succession, choosing Mr Fazio, then the senior of the two deputy directors.
Mr Lamberto Dini, director-general and the natural hierarchical choice, was
overlooked.
No explanation was ever given for ignoring Mr Dini, who was a better known
international central banker. But within the bank and among Italy's banking
community, it was no secret that Mr Ciampi and Mr Dini had an awkward
relationship. Mr Dini was considered too close to the old Christian Democrat
party, including former premier Giulio Andreotti, whose contact with Mr
Ciampi was frosty at best.
The governor and the three other members of the bank's executive directorate
are appointed by the body's governing council (composed of the Bank's
regional office chairmen). They are then confirmed by the head of state in
consultation with the government which formalises the appointments. Mr Fazio
was appointed rapidly because of Mr Ciampi's unique position as a former
governor and because of his and Mr Fazio's close understanding with
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
The situation was more complex when Mr Dini became treasury minister in May.
He was anxious to have a say in his successor and he was now in an equal if
not more powerful role than the man promoted over him a year previously.
Mr Berlusconi, the premier, and his ministers could have won sympathy if the
appointment had been placed in the context of a much-needed debate on
introducing blood to an institution that had become too complacent and
inward-looking. Unfortunately, there was no debate, only sniping conducted
in the spirit of a vendetta.
This immediately took the form of a veto on Mr Tommaso Padoa Schioppa,
technically the next in line as senior deputy-director and a highly
respected central banker, who had played an important part in pre-Maastricht
work on monetary union. However, he was seen as one of the 'Ciampi boys' -
closely linked to the former governor and premier - and whose crime in the
eyes of the new government was to have identified too much with the left.
The government advanced several outside candidates - Mr Rainer Masera, head
of Imi, the state-run financial institution being privatised, Mr Mario
Draghi, the brilliant director-general of the Treasury, and latterly Mr
Paolo Savona, a banker and former industry minister in the Ciampi
government. But Mr Fazio insisted the appointment come from within the bank.
As early as July, the governor suggested Mr Desario, promoted by Mr Fazio in
1993 to become the fourth member of the directorate, as a compromise
candidate. But the stand-off has lasted until now, aggravated by individual
members of the right-wing coalition conducting a smear campaign against the
Bank of Italy.
The government climb-down is partly the result of pressure from leading
members of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, who have argued
the dispute was damaging Italy's international credibility. Equally, Mr
Berlusconi may well have recognised the conflict is an unnecessary diversion
from securing safe passage for the 1995 budget.
Those who know the affair well say Mr Desario, whose career at the Bank of
Italy has been in banking supervision, is not of the same calibre as the
other candidates. They say the Desario promotion gives Mr Fazio a tight grip
on monetary policy. But the price may well be that the government pays less
attention to the Bank of Italy's counsels, and turns more to Confindustria
and the Treasury. The same battle could also repeat itself over a
replacement to Mr Desario.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Swedish budget deficit set to widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fragile state of Sweden's economy was underscored yesterday when the
government announced a much bigger than expected budget deficit, threatening
growth prospects. The central bank also warned that price rise expectations
in 1995 exceeded its target ceiling of 3 per cent inflation.
The finance ministry said the budget deficit in the current 1994-95 fiscal
year would be SKr201bn (Pounds 17.3bn), well above the SKr150bn previously
forecast and likely to be around last year's record equivalent of 13 per
cent of gross national product. The ministry blamed increased borrowing
costs.
Mr Goran Persson, the new Social Democratic finance minister, said more cuts
in public spending were now probable in January's budget beyond those
already being implemented and the fiscal measures he was due to introduce
early next month. Next month's package would reflect his plan outlined
during the campaign for last month's general election for spending cuts and
tax increases to strengthen the budget by SKr61bn over four years.
Mr Persson acknowledged the threat which the crisis in the public finances
now poses to Sweden's slow recovery from three years of recession. He said a
new round of spending cuts in January would have a negative effect on
growth. Already, earlier forecasts of 3 per cent GNP growth in 1995 have
been downgraded to 2 per cent or less.
To add to his difficulties, the Riksbank said yesterday that inflationary
pressure was on the rise because of increasing producer prices - prompted by
the heavy fall in the value of the krona last year - and historically high
levels of capacity utilisation in industry.
It issued an implicit warning that short-term interest rates might have to
rise to check inflation unless the government restored market confidence in
the public finances.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading European carmakers yesterday accused the European Commission and EU
governments of failing to meet financial and strategic planning obligations
under an eight-year Ecu900m (Pounds 710m) collaborative research programme.
The Prometheus research programme aims to halve the EU's 50,000 road deaths
a year by 2010 through the greater use of in-car electronic information
systems and other technological developments.
Mr Jacques Calvet, Peugeot chairman, and Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, managing
director of Fiat and president of the European Automobile Manufacturers
Association, warned that unless Brussels and the 12 EU member states made
better progress in creating common standards and electronic languages for
such items as roadside beacons transmitting information to receivers in
vehicles this goal would be threatened. In addition, technology developed by
Europe's vehicle and component manufacturers would be overtaken by the
Japanese and North American motor industries.
Also at stake were tens of billions of Ecus, which business loses every year
through delays, wasted man-hours and other costs, industry leaders said.
The warnings came at a Paris conference and exhibition at which 90 cars and
commercial vehicles fitted with the technology developed under the
programme, which started in 1986, were demonstrated.
The cars could:
illuminate long distances in the dark with infra-red and ultra-violet
headlights;
automatically avoid collision with radar;
cruise 'intelligently' by automatically keeping pace with vehicles in front;
stay within white lines, thanks to computer image processing;
know exactly where they were on the Paris road network via satellite; and
summon emergency services to the exact location of a breakdown or accident
with or without any driver action.
Mr Calvet and Mr Garuzzo sharply criticised 'budgeting problems' in Brussels
and national governments, which have led to the 20 vehicle and component
makers within Prometheus funding 70 per cent of the research programme.

<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday sought to defuse
factional disputes within his government which threaten the chances of the
right in next spring's presidential elections.
The divisions in the centre-right coalition have been fuelled by the
undeclared contest between Mr Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the
Gaullist RPR party, for the conservative candidacy in the presidential
polls.
Mr Balladur met Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, and Mr Charles Pasqua,
interior minister, yesterday to urge the maintenance of government unity.
Last week, the two ministers clashed when Mr Juppe, a strong supporter of Mr
Chirac, rejected Mr Pasqua's proposal for primary elections to select a
single conservative candidate for the presidential elections.
Mr Pasqua responded by suggesting that Mr Juppe should leave the government,
claiming that the foreign minister's membership of a support committee for
Mr Chirac was incompatible with his position in the cabinet. Mr Francois
Leotard, defence minister and a Balladur supporter, has also been at odds
with Mr Juppe following the defence minister's remarks that US policy
towards Iraq was motivated by domestic political considerations.
After meeting the prime minister, Mr Juppe said he was 'staggered by the
deterioration of the political climate', but denied having breached cabinet
solidarity.
Mr Balladur is seeking to delay campaigning for next year's presidential
poll until January, partly because of his own interest in silencing Chirac
supporters. He has also written to Mr Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, junior partner in the RPR-UDF coalition,
calling for a meeting to discuss a political ceasefire.
The increasingly public disputes between cabinet members has further
unsettled a government shaken by two resignations in the past three months.
Mr Alain Carignon, communications minister, and Mr Gerard Longuet, industry
minister, stepped down following corruption allegations.
The various setbacks have highlighted the potential threat to the right from
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president and a possible
Socialist presidential candidate. Mr Delors has said he will not make a
decision on his candidacy until the beginning of next year, but he has
closed the gap with Mr Balladur in recent opinion polls.
An IFOP poll published yesterday showed that Mr Delors had gained five
percentage points to close within four points of Mr Balladur in a survey of
voting intentions for the second and decisive round of the presidential
elections.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Brittan in struggle over E Europe portfolio

Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, is fighting an uphill battle to
keep control of relations with central and eastern Europe in the new
European Commission, Brussels diplomats said yesterday.
With a French-led campaign to cut Sir Leon down to size apparently making
headway, the senior British commissioner is pinning hopes of preserving his
bureaucratic empire on Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany.
Sir Leon's camp welcomed Mr Kohl's election victory this week, on the
grounds that the German leader will prefer a free-trader committed to early
enlargement of the EU to the emerging democracies of central Europe. The
British hope he will pass on the message to Mr Jacques Santer, who takes
over as Commission president next January from Mr Jacques Delors.
But UK officials remain worried that Mr Kohl may tip support to France,
whose senior incoming commissioner - Mrs Edith Cresson, a former French
premier - is said to have expressed interest in the eastern European dossier
(which also includes Russia and the former Soviet republics).
Handling relations with central and eastern Europe is rated as the plum job
in the new five-year Commission headed by Mr Santer. One of its chief tasks
will be to lay the groundwork for the entry of Poland, the Czech republic
and Hungary, and possibly Slovakia and Slovenia, into the EU around the turn
of the century - a daunting challenge but also one with a guaranteed high
political profile.
Sir Leon's credentials rest mainly on his role in the successful conclusion
of the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation and his successful
lobbying for more generous EU market access for central and east European
exporters.
But Mr Santer's problem is that he does not have enough good jobs to share
around in the next Commission, which will expand from 17 to 21
commissioners, assuming Sweden and Norway join Austria and Finland in
supporting membership in referendums next month.
Mr Santer will attempt to reach agreement among his new colleagues on a
share-out of portfolios at a meeting in Luxembourg at the end of the month.
Already, the session is being billed as a test of his grip on his new
colleagues and his clout with member states.
Responsibility for the external relations portfolio is currently shared
between three Commissioners: Sir Leon, Mr Hans van den Broek, the former
Dutch foreign minister who handles political affairs, and Mr Manuel Marin,
the long-serving senior Spanish commissioner, who is responsible for
development aid, Latin America and most of the Mediterranean.
The carve-up is dogged by inefficiencies, overlap and personal rivalry.
Mr Marin is understood to have won control of Latin America and expanding
responsibility in the Mediterranean, in exchange for yielding the dossier
relating to the Lome convention, the trade arrangement with 60 African,
Caribbean and poorer Pacific countries, mainly former European colonies.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Bank of Italy wins appointment row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government yesterday backed down in its long-running dispute
with the Bank of Italy over the nomination of a new director-general from
within the bank.
The central bank has fought a bruising battle over its second highest post
with the right-wing coalition to ensure an insider replaced Mr Lamberto
Dini, who left the job to become treasury minister in May.
Yesterday the bank's governing council named as a replacement Mr Vincenzo
Desario, the junior of the two deputy directors who form part of the
four-man executive directorate of the Bank of Italy.
The 61-year-old Mr Desario is a compromise candidate chosen over Mr Tommaso
Padoa Schioppa, the senior deputy director, technically the first in line
for the job but vetoed by the Berlusconi government as being too close to
the former Ciampi administration. In a statement yesterday the Bank of Italy
stressed its appreciation of Mr Padoa Schioppa.
The Desario appointment has to be approved by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
and the cabinet. Bank of Italy officials yesterday pointed out that an
appointment proposed by the governing council, composed of chairmen of the
bank's regional offices, has never been turned down.
If the government climbs down as expected and accepts Mr Desario, it still
leaves unresolved the issue of Mr Desario's successor. The governing council
yesterday avoided discussion of filling the fourth place on the directorate.
The government is considered unlikely to take this defeat lying down and
yesterday Mr Antonio Parlato, junior minister at the treasury for the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, said legislation to change the statutes
of the Bank of Italy would shortly be placed before parliament.
The opposition welcomed the outcome. A spokesman for the former communist
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) said: 'The government has been unable to
impose its line, while the Bank of Italy in the midst of hundreds of
difficulties has managed to defend its autonomy and mark a point in its
favour.'
The government had sought to bring in an outsider, arguing the bank needed
new blood. This was seen both within the bank and outside as an attempt by
the executive to exert greater control over the bank, especially regarding
interest rates policy.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Moscow names acting chief for central bank
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday named Ms Tatyana Paramonova as acting
chairman of the Russian central bank in succession to Mr Victor
Gerashchenko. She is one of the youngest of the bank's deputy chairmen and
the only woman in its senior management.
Ms Paramonova, 44, joined the bank's top echelons only two years ago when Mr
Gerashchenko was appointed head of the bank six months after relinquishing
his post as head of the Soviet State Bank at the end of 1991.
She was described yesterday by Mr Andrei Illarionov, a prominent reform
economist, as 'Mr Gerashchenko's right hand, but tougher on inflation than
he was'.
A senior western financial official in Moscow welcomed the appointment,
saying that Mrs Paramonova had earned a high reputation for her tough line
on credits and on the fight against inflation.
However,the general view is that her relative youth, her sex and her brief
time in the bank's ruling council mean that she is a temporary appointment
while the struggle continues over who takes the job on a permanent basis.
The state duma, or lower house of parliament, yesterday decided to postpone
a debate on Mr Gerashchenko's resignation - a debate demanded by those
deputies who insist that only the duma has the right to accept a resignation
and to confirm appointment of a new chairman. Ms Paramonova's appointment,
since it is a temporary one, does not require to go before the duma.
Though the appointment fills the vacancy left by Mr Gerashchenko and stills
the fears of Moscow's bankers, it leaves the main Russian financial
institutions in the hands of young, inexperienced and temporary figures.
Last week, Mr Andrei Vavilov was appointed acting finance minister in place
of the sacked Mr Sergei Dubuinin - himself 'acting' - and his status was
further compromised by briefings from presidential spokesmen to the effect
that he was a 'temporary' acting minister.
Her appointment comes on the eve of talks today between Russian officials
and a top-level team from the International Monetary Fund on a standby loan
of Dollars 4bn.

FT  19 OCT 94 / IBM poised to sell disk drive plant at Havant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer maker, is
within weeks of agreeing the sale of all or part of one of its best-known
European manufacturing operations.
The site, at Havant, Hampshire, principally manufactures disk drives for
personal computers and is the sole source of some important IBM systems.
It employs some 1,500 people and turns over more than Pounds 500m a year. It
is profitable, although separate figures are not published.
Among the likely bidders are the plant's own senior management, led by
managing director Mr Ken Wilkie. It is not known how IBM regards the
prospect of a management buy-out at the plant although it would not be the
first time IBM had accepted such a buy-out in the UK. It recently sold its
property management activities to its senior staff.
The planned disposal follows the sale of a majority stake in the company's
printer operations at Jarfalla, Sweden, to a Swedish venture capital company
earlier this year. It also follows the opening of part of its Montpellier,
France, manufacturing facil-ities for lease by other companies.
These are unprecedented moves for the computer giant which has traditionally
owned and controlled its manufacturing capacity. The sites at Havant,
Jarfalla, Montpellier and Valencia in Spain were identified last year as
'surplus to requirements' as part of the company's strategy to return to
profitability.
IBM has been reducing staff numbers and manufacturing capacity as it comes
to terms with the economics of a computer industry dominated by personal
computers which yield low profit margins compared with mainframe computers,
its traditional strength.
Havant has been operating as an 'independent business unit' - run by local
management with the option to seek manufacturing contracts from outside
customers.
It has been diversifying into the contract manufacture of systems for other
customers. At the end of last year, for example, it signed a contract to
make disk drives for Western Digital, a US disk drive supplier.
The staff were told this week that several potential new owners had been
identified and that the parent company expected to make a final decision in
the near future. A small number of potential buyers has been invited to view
the plant's operations.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Rover to boost UK workforce as demand surges: Carmaker will
create 1,450 jobs at plants over next six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, is creating 1,450 jobs at its British plants
in response to strongly rising sales, particularly in export markets.
About 1,000 of the jobs will be at the main Rover plant at Longbridge,
Birmingham, in vehicle assembly and engine production.
A further 300 workers will be recruited at the Land Rover plant at Solihull,
near Birmingham, to support rising production of the new Range Rover luxury
four-wheel-drive vehicle, while 150 jobs will be added at the body and
pressings plant at Swindon.
The recruitment halts the long decline in the size of the workforce of Rover
(formerly British Leyland), which has fallen from 41,700 in 1990 to 33,000
last year. The workforce has been cut from 96,000 in 1984.
Rover, taken over by BMW in January, said recruitment of the workers would
take place during the next six months. The workforce worldwide was being
increased to about 35,500 to meet increases in production and future model
programmes, which formed part of the group's Pounds 1.5bn, five-year
investment plans.
Next year Rover will replace its current 200/400 range and launch a new
range of MG sports cars.
Rover has added 1,300 jobs at its Land Rover Solihull plant in the past 18
months to support rising production of its Discovery four-wheel-drive
vehicle.
The group's retail sales in the first nine months worldwide rose by 9 per
cent to 371,805 from 341,075 in the corresponding nine months last year with
sales in continental Europe increasing up by 20 per cent.
Its sales increased by only 3.2 per cent in the UK market, but Mr John
Towers, Rover group chief executive, said the group was willing to accept a
fall in its UK market share, as long as this was more than offset by rising
exports in order to reduce its current heavy domestic reliance.
'I would be happy with a lower market share in the UK, so that sales and
marketing can be in line with the positioning of the Rover brand rather than
responding to business pressures,' he said.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Walker to leave Lloyds for Morgan Stanley post: Deputy
chairman was expected to take over as head of UK bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir David Walker, the deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank who was widely expected
to take over as chairman, is to leave to join the US investment bank Morgan
Stanley.
Sir David's decision means that Lloyds, the most consistently profitable
British bank, must select both a new chairman and a new chief executive
within two and a half years.
Sir David, who is 54, is to become executive chairman of Morgan Stanley in
Europe. He said that he had expected his role at Lloyds to be 'more
executive than is the case', and he was attracted by the idea of a 'wholly
executive and more than full-time job' when approached by Morgan Stanley.
The move could allow Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, to succeed
Sir Robin Ibbs as chairman.
Sir Robin is due to retire in two years when he is 70. However, it would be
the first time a Lloyds chief executive has become chairman. The post has
traditionally been filled from outside.
Another candidate to succeed Sir Robin may be Sir Richard Greenbury, the
57-year-old chairman of Marks and Spencer, who is a non-executive director
of Lloyds.
Sir David, a former director of the Bank of England and chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board, was thought likely to become chairman
rapidly when he joined Lloyds in 1992, but Sir Robin has stayed longer than
expected.
Sir David said that Sir Robin was 'hale and hearty, and good for another two
and half years'. He did not expect there to be 'any problem at all' in
finding a chairman to succeed him in what was 'a superbly managed
organisation'.
The main uncertainty over management succession at Lloyds concerns Sir
Brian, who is due to step down as chief executive at the end of 1996 after
his term was extended earlier this year. Sir Brian has no obvious internal
successor.
Lloyds emphasised yesterday that it had two years to make decisions on
management succession. One director said that there was 'no rush' for the
board to choose successors, and that no decision on either post was
imminent.
Lloyds emerged as the most profitable of the 'big four' clearing banks in
the late 1980s. It is trying to take over Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building
Society for Pounds 1.8bn as part of its effort to expand retail banking.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, said that Sir David, who will
be a member of the firm's New York board, would bring both 'a wealth of
experience' and 'extensive relationships with key figures'.
Morgan Stanley has grown rapidly in Europe in the past two years and
generated Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 790m) of revenues there last year. Some
directors expect it to double its European business within the next two or
three years.

FT  19 OCT 94 / Murdoch hopes BSkyB float will net Dollars 1bn for News Corp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, said yesterday he hoped
that the flotation of British Sky Broadcasting could lead to an early cash
injection of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 625m) into News Corp.
The remark at the company's annual meeting in Adelaide suggested that Mr
Murdoch thinks the flotation could value the satellite broadcaster at
Dollars 10bn or Pounds 6.25bn - the highest figure so far suggested
publicly. Most analysts expected the sell-off to value the company at Pounds
4bn-Pounds 5bn. News Corp at present owns 50 per cent of BSkyB.
In remarks made from notes rather than a prepared text, Mr Murdoch said: 'If
one is to believe the expectations of the analysts and the valuations that
have been put on the proposed reduction from 50 per cent to 40 per cent of
our shareholding, it will see a strengthening (that is contingent on a lot
of issues and if forecasts are correct) of the News Corporation balance
sheet by the injection of another USDollars 1bn in cash.'
A pathfinder document preparing the way for the flotation is expected next
month, with mid-December the likely date for the flotation of BSkyB, in
which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 17.5 per cent stake.
Mr Murdoch said he very much hoped, markets permitting, that the sale could
take place within the next few weeks or by January 1995 at the latest.
Analysts believe that if a December deadline is missed the next realistic
date would be March.
The News Corp chairman conceded that most of his established businesses,
although extremely active, had not increased profits in the past 12 months.
The big growth had come from investments in two partnership companies -
BSkyB, which recorded a 170 per cent rise in operating profits in the year
to the end of June, and Ansett airlines of Australia.
Together, the two associated companies contributed a combined ADollars 394m
to boost News Corp's 1993-94 net profit to ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds 550m).
Mr Murdoch also spelled out how he sees the development of the organisation
 -vertical integration 'from top to bottom ' in the media business.
He added that the company intended 'to expand and double and then redouble
our production of electronically filmed entertainment'. As part of the plan,
the company was establishing a ADollars 20m film production centre in Sydney
which would produce at least three international feature movies a year.
Shareholders were also given new details about News International's
newspaper price-cutting wars in the UK. Mr Murdoch, who admitted that at one
stage selling The Sun at 20p had cost the company Pounds 1m a week, said the
price of the paper, now 22p, would gradually rise.
'We expect to hold the majority of our (circulation) gain as we go back up
in price slowly,' he said. With The Times still selling at 20p, Mr Murdoch
promised: 'We will keep that pressure on there and keep going.'
He also said he was in no hurry to issue new limited-voting preference
shares in News Corp and had no plans for big acquisitions at the moment.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New Look margins grow to 16.9% in first
half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating margins at New Look, the women's wear chain, grew to 16.9 per cent
in its first half, the pathfinder prospectus showed yesterday.
The 224-shop chain, which hopes for a market value above Pounds 150m, made
operating profits of Pounds 9.92m on sales of Pounds 58.7m in the six months
to September 24. In the year to the end of March, when operating margins
were 12.5 per cent, operating profits were Pounds 11.1m on sales of Pounds
88.4m.
Mr Tom Singh, founder and deputy chairman, said the group was well on course
for sales of more than Pounds 100m this year. Sales per square foot were
Pounds 449 in 1993-94, up from Pounds 299 in 1989-90.
He attributes the growth, among other factors, to a stock turnover rate of
more than 15 times, compared with a sector average of eight times. More than
1.5m customers pass through the shops every week.
The group is wholly owned by the Singh family. About 35 per cent of the
equity is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer.
Mr Singh will not be selling any shares. He will have about 9 per cent of
the company after flotation.
The flotation will raise about Pounds 10m of new money, most of which will
be spent on freeholds.
The prospectus shows that Mr Singh, the managing director and the corporate
development director will be paid 2 per cent of any increase in net profits
under a bonus scheme. Mr Singh said yesterday that the group was highly
incentivised, with bonus schemes for all its workers, including the 71 per
cent of staff who are part time.
Impact day is November 3 and dealings are expected to begin on November 18.
Sponsors are J Henry Schroder Wagg and brokers James Capel.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Activity in homes market declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in the housing market declined last month, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors said yesterday.
Its survey of estate agents mirrors research by other business groups which
suggested that the modest rise in activity over the summer has not been
sustained.
Nearly 60 per cent of the 127 agents included in the institution's survey
said that pre-purchase activity such as inquiries and viewings declined
during the month. Just 16 per cent said that activity had increased while 24
per cent reported no change.
A survey last week by the National Association of Estate Agents found
two-thirds of its members reporting lower activity last month.
Three-quarters of the agents questioned by the institution said that house
prices remained stable, although 15 per cent reported a decline.
Mr Peter Miller of the institution said: 'Optimism about the short-term
prospects for the housing market recovery has seeped away as the anticipated
autumn pick-up in most areas simply failed to happen.'
He added: 'It is now clear that neither house prices nor market volumes will
increase until the new year at the earliest.' Mr Miller said that while the
rise in interest rates had deterred some potential buyers, local factors
were more important than national trends.
The Halifax index showed prices rising slightly in the south in the past
three months but falling in the north.
The survey shows marked variations in housing market conditions even in
neighbouring towns, depending on their local economic fortunes.
Mr Robert Thomas, housing market analyst at UBS, the stockbroking group,
said that in spite of regional variations, the evidence pointed
unambiguously to a weaker market.
He said: 'The relative weakness of personal disposable income following this
year's tax increases and the psychological effect of higher interest rates
have clearly had an impact.'

Paribas, one of France's leading banks, yesterday announced the purchase of
all outstanding shares in two Luxembourg financial companies in which it had
long held strategic stakes.
The purchase came in an agreement signed with Groupe General Mediterranean
Holding-Compagnie Internationale de Participations Bancaires et Financieres
(GMH-CIPAF), the holder of the remaining shares.
The bank bought the remaining 20 per cent of shares in Banque Paribas
Luxembourg, which was created in 1964 and separated from Paribas at the time
of its nationalisation by the French government in 1982.
It also bought the remaining 50 per cent of outstanding shares in Banque
Continentale du Luxembourg, which had developed links with Paribas and
GMH-CIPAF since 1982.
Both sides declined to reveal the price. Banque Continentale du Luxembourg
last year reported net assets of FFr473m and net profits of FFr50m (Dollars
9.45m), while Banque Paribas Luxembourg had assets of FFr880m and profits of
FFr150m in 1993.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel warns of lower revenue and outlines fares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, has been hit harder than expected
by delays to the start of rail services.
It said yesterday it expected its revenues for 1994 to be only a quarter of
the Pounds 135m (Dollars 213m) figure which it was predicting as recently as
May, at the time of its Pounds 858m rights issue. Analysts in London had
predicted revenues might be cut to Pounds 90m-Pounds 100m. Eurotunnel shares
fell 7p to 221p.
Eurotunnel faces tough negotiations with its bankers when it starts to draw
down its loans early next year. But it expects they will continue to provide
backing, according to Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman.
Analysts expressed surprise at the revenue shortfall and predicted the group
would fail to meet its banking covenants next year. Mr Richard Hannah of UBS
Securities said: 'To miss first-year forecasts by this kind of margin is
upsetting to say the least. One wonders how accurate their future figures
will be.'
But Eurotunnel's main lenders said they remained supportive and were
unlikely to force a cash crisis in the spring ahead of the peak holiday
season. One leading bank lender, however, said: 'All we can do at this stage
is sit and pray'.
Sir Alastair commented: 'We have had a grim and very hard nine months and we
have not delivered all the expectations in our (rights issue) prospectus.
But we believe were are getting into a position of delivering the goods.'
Eurotunnel announced yesterday that high-speed Eurostar services through the
tunnel would start on November 14. This represents the final stage in the
introduction of passenger and freight services and will bring the tunnel
into direct competition with the airlines on short-haul routes.
Eurostar fares for London-Paris will range from Pounds 95 return, provided a
booking is made 14 days in advance, up to Pounds 195 for first class travel
including a hot, three-course meal for an initial 'discovery' period lasting
until next spring.
Eurotunnel reported a Pounds 47m loss in the first six months of the year,
most of it resulting from interest and financing charges and with a
contribution of only Pounds 2m from the limited freight services which began
in late May.
But tight control on costs and savings made because services were started
late had meant cash flow was Pounds 3m better than was expected at the time
of the rights prospectus. Eurotunnel expects that by the end of 1994 its
cash position will be Pounds 50m worse than planned.
In spite of these setbacks, 'there is no actual or potential breach of our
loan covenants let alone a default,' said Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial
officer 'These estimates could pose technical problems when we draw down our
bank loans but this situation is quite familiar to us and our bankers.'
Sir Alastair denied there was any need for another cash call. 'No way will
there be another rights issue', he said. 'We don't need one. Our way forward
is with our banks and with our warrant holders later.' Eurotunnel expects to
raise Pounds 200m if warrant holders exercise their rights.

<TEXT>
President Suharto yesterday forced the postponement of his own trial in a
landmark suit charging him with diverting state funds meant for preservation
of Indonesia's rain forests. As no presidential lawyer turned up for the
hearing on the opening day of the trial, Judge Benyamin Mangkudilaga of
Jakarta's State Administrative Court said he had no option but to put it off
until Oct. 31. Mr Suharto is not expected to testify in the trial, the first
time he has been taken to court in his three decades of power. The suit,
filed by six environmental groups in August, accuses Mr Suharto of ignoring
ecological concerns by diverting Dollars 183m in state forestry funds as an
interest-free loan to the state-owned Indonesian aircraft industry for a
project to develop a passenger plane. The prototype of the 64-seat turboprop
plane is scheduled to roll out of the plant next month, coinciding with a
summit of heads of state from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

Indonesia will need more than Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.3bn) in infrastructure
investment over the next five years, President Suharto said at the opening
of the world infrastructure forum Asia, which the Indonesian government is
hosting this week. 'We hope most of this investment is borne by the private
sectors, both domestic and foreign,' he said. According to a government
report Indonesia needs the private sector to invest at least Dollars 18bn in
infrastructure projects over the next five years. That investment will be
channelled mainly into toll roads, container ports, airports, power plants,
housing and water supplies. In June, the government unveiled a deregulation
package for foreign investment which opened up most of these sectors to
foreign capital.

More than 5,000 Islamic supporters, some armed, marched through Gaza City

Julian Ozanne.
The march followed riots earlier in the day by angry students demonstrating
against an internal Palestinian crack down on the extremist Hamas movement
responsible for the kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier last week.
Hamas has demanded that Mr Yassir Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation, sack Gen Nasr Youssef who last week headed the operation to
arrest and question Hamas activists believed to have information on the
kidnapped Israeli. During yesterday's march organised by Hamas some
activists fired guns in the air in defiance of last week's PLO decision to
ban unlicensed firearms.
The disturbances reveal the bitter divide which has emerged between the PLO
and Hamas since the kidnapping crisis. In an effort to calm the tension Mr
Arafat yesterday began releasing some of the 300 Hamas activists he arrested
last week and detained a PLO general who ordered his troops to fire in the
air during a Hamas demonstration at the Gaza central prison on Saturday.
Mr Arafat's advisers have warned the PLO leader against giving in to Israeli
and western pressure.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Queen arrives in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Queen Elizabeth, the first reigning British monarch to visit Russia,
inspects a guard of honour on her arrival in Moscow yesterday, She was
greeted at Vnukovo 11 Airport by Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime
minister, as Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is on holiday.
Later, the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, received a formal red
carpet welcome from President Boris Yeltsin at St George's Hall in the
Kremlin.
However, the start of the historic four-day visit was marred by furore over
the marital problems of her son and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, the
Prince of Wales.
John Major, the UK prime minister, dismissed as 'pretty far from the mark'
reports that he was to advise the Queen that the prince and the Princess of
Wales should divorce as soon possible. Close aides of the prime minister
made clear that he continued to believe the monarchy was the cornerstone of
the British constitution and must remain so.

FT  18 OCT 94 / France launches Renault shares: First step in partial
sell-off - Car group valued at up to FFr42.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will today launch the partial privatisation of
Renault, the motor group that is one of the most attractive assets in the
country's public sector and a former bastion of union power.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, gave a guideline price of between
FFr163 and FFr178 per share for institutional investors, valuing the company
at between FFr39bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and FFr42.5bn. The price range, which
officials described as non-binding, is below many market estimates which
have been between FFr42bn and FFr45bn.
Mr Alphandery described the partial privatisation, which is expected within
the next month, as an important step for the motor group and for French
financial markets.
'It will give Renault the resources for development and place it in pole
position for competition with its rivals. It also puts one of France's most
important industrial groups on the bourse,' he said.
The issue is being aimed mainly at individual investors, who will be able to
make non-binding applications for shares from today. Mr Alphandery said the
government planned to sell about 60 per cent of the shares to individuals,
but the proportion could be increased to two-thirds if demand was strong.
Previous issues in the French government's privatisation programme have seen
shares clawed back from institutional investors following strong
subscriptions by individuals. Industry observers in Paris predicted that
Renault would also see keen interest.
'It is a household name and seems likely to be fairly priced,' said a motor
industry analyst at a French merchant bank. He added that Renault, which
achieved profits of FF1.07bn last year and forecasts a strong increase in
1994, was one of the few motor groups to remain in profit during the
recession in the industry in 1992 and 1993.
Mr Alphandery stressed that the company would remain in French hands and
that the government, which holds 80 per cent of Renault's shares, would
retain a 51 per cent stake. 'Privatisation is not on the agenda. There are
no plans for a second tranche to be floated on the bourse.'
The proceeds of the share sale are expected to be used to finance a capital
increase at Air France, the loss-making state-owned airline.
The government's decision to limit the flotation to a partial privatisation
reflects the political sensitivity of Renault. The communist-led union, the
Confederation Generale du Travail, has sought to block the sale of Renault
shares, but calls for industrial action at the motor group have met with
little success.
As part of the operation, Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an
aborted merger, will sell between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of the French
company's shares. Volvo holds 20 per cent of Renault's equity, which it has
kept since the collapse of the merger plans last year.
The French economy minister said that foreign shareholders would be welcome
and that international investors had expressed strong interest in the issue.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie bounces from 3,100 in subdued
trading - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Firmness in government bond prices yesterday helped the UK equity market
recover after at first dipping below the Footsie 3,100 mark recaptured so
recently. The London market was also helped by renewed focus on the defence
sector after suggestions that GEC, already closely watching developments in
the VSEL situation, might be interested in bidding for British Aerospace
itself.
London traders maintained that the outcome of the German elections had been
widely foreseen, but the big dollar earning stocks were subdued by
uncertainty over the medium term outlook for the US currency. Oil shares
lacked strength as the Iraq-Kuwait situation appeared to become more stable.
Trading volume was generally poor, but with activity in the defence stocks
boosting the Seaq total. A trading programme ranging across the FT-SE 100
and Mid 250 stocks was printed in the second half of the session.
Led by stock index futures, the market bounced from its early low and, at
the day's best, the Footsie was 26 points ahead. Support faded later and in
spite of a rise of 18 points on the Dow Jones Indus-trial Average in UK
trading hours, the final reading of 3,120.2 on the FT-SE 100-share Index
showed a gain on the day of only 13.5 points. Private investor interest
appeared to have faded away again, leaving the broader range of the market
without much strength to face profit-takers.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 4.6 at 3,548 and overall volume of 459.5m
shares through the Seaq network showed a fall of nearly one fifth from
Friday's total. Volume in equities was boosted at the close on Friday by the
sudden weakness in the US dollar which prompted some US selling of the blue
chip internationals in London.
Press suggestions that GEC might bid for British Aerospace were not new,
having been widely canvassed as a part of the general reshaping of the
western defence industry envisaged following glasnost.
There was significant market support for a GEC move yesterday, although few
analysts expect such a development without offical sanction. At least one
sector analyst rejected any suggestion of a GEC strike. Trading figures from
VSEL had little impact since the share price remains linked, via the share
bid offer, to the Aerospace share price.
Shares in Eurotunnel responded firmly at first to the board's interim
report, which rejected outright any talk of another rights issue or threat
to banking covenants. But by the close the shares were slipping away as
analysts focused on the disappointing downgrading of 1994 revenue forecasts.
Traders took a mixed view of prospects for the UK equity market in the near
term. The institutions were clearly keeping out of the way yesterday,
waiting for the latest UK Public Sector Borrowing estimates, wich are due
this morning. Most forecasts are for a sharp increase in the September
figure and there is some doubt as to how this would be taken in the British
government bond market.
The recovery in UK gilts remains the key to a genuine rally in UK equities
and analysts noted yesterday that the FT-SE 100 Index is still unable to
break away from the 3,100 level which appears to have become a significant
barrier.
However, some traders commented that much of the potentially unsettling news
in the market - ranging from the German elections to the latest raft of US
economic statistics - is now out of the way and that UK equities could
resume their upward path. Doubts over the delay in recovery in retail
spending failed to hold back shares in the big store groups, and banking
stocks continued to hope that domestic base rates can remain at present
levels, at least until the new year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers of BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that US investors have continued to reduce their holdings in BP in
recent weeks left the shares slightly under the weather and finally a penny
easier at 421 1/2 p, although dealers were at pains to point out that the
stock had outperformed the market by a substantial amount this year. And the
stock price was helped by bullish noises from Lehman Brothers, the US
brokerage.
BP said ADRs issued by Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York accounted for 19.54
per cent of BP's issued capital, or 1.07bn shares, down from a previous
level of around 19.7 per cent and a high point of above 26 per cent last
year. BP shares reached an all-time high of 430p last month.
Shell edged up 3 to 730p as the market responded to a bullish press report
on the outlook for petrochemicals.
Exco, the money broking group which came to the market in the summer at 175p
a share, lost 15 at 179p, after 180p, as the market reacted badly to news of
the resignation, from December 31, of Mr Ron Sandler, the chief executive.
He will be succeeded by Mr Peter Edge, who currently runs Exco's money
broking business.
Mr Sandler joined Exco in April last year and is thought to have crossed
swords with the rest of the broker's board, according to dealers. 'It looks
bad so soon after the flotation,' said one dealer.
Exco reiterated the view that its performance for the year 'will be
satisfactory' but also warned of subdued trading in the third quarter.
The dollar's retreat affected HSBC, whose fortunes are viewed as linked to
those of Hong Kong. HSBC shares, which began to weaken late last week,
slipped 7 to 716p.
Guinness put on 5 at 465p, with NatWest Securities adding the shares to its
Top 15 performing stocks. Highland Distilleries dipped 15 to 419p in spite
of improved half-year profits and an extra 0.66p on the interim dividend.
Northern Ireland Electricity was one of the star turns in a generally
buoyant electricity sector, the shares climbing 10 to 385p after the company
said it is looking at ways of restoring the electricity transmission link
with the Republic of Ireland, a move long viewed as bullish for NIE.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca was helped by news that it hoped to extend the
range of its prostate cancer drug, Zoladex, in the US. The shares rose 9 to
833p.
Rival Glaxo was assisted by the publication of a large trade carried out two
working days previously at above the current market price. A block of 4.4m
shares was placed at 620p a share and the underlying stock moved forward 3
to 615p in spite of a persistently weak US dollar.
The latest national newspaper circulation figures acted on various media
stocks. Mirror Group Newspapers was 2 firmer at 134p after its flagship
paper recorded a 0.58 per cent rise in circulation against 1/2 per cent fall
in the Sun, whose parent company News International closed unchanged at
149p. Telegraph shares were down 5 at 341p and Sunday Telegraph sales were
down on the month.
Cable and Wireless's recent bout of outperformance triggered some switching
by action funds out of C&amp;W, 7 off at 414p, and into BT, up 6 at 400 1/2 p.
In an otherwise quiet property sector, MEPC fell 10 to 432p following a
downgraded net asset valuation by BZW.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: ICI strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chemicals leader ICI outperformed the leading share index smartly on a
combination of positive press comment and analysts' recommendations.
Initially, the shares spiked higher as one newspaper argued that any
softening of commodity prices in the US would be irrelevant to European
chemicals groups because of the low levels of the exports to the US.
Then, securities houses UBS and Hoare Govett stressed their positive view of
the stock. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare said: 'Given the forward momentum of
earnings recovery the cyclical rating has scope to expand upward.'
Even NatWest Securities, which has a more downbeat view of the stock,
anticipates 'sparkling' third-quarter figures on October 27, given the
'dramatic product price increases coming through in petrochemicals, plastics
and some bulk inorganic chemicals'. A rash of cheap buying after last week's
weakness saw the shares recover 25 1/2 to 818p.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's announcement that revenue for 1994 would be in the region of
Pounds 34m, and not the Pounds 137m forecast at the time of the May rights
issue, left the shares down 7 at 221p, the lowest level since February 1988.
This was far worse than even the most pessimistic London analyst had
expected and the company now has very few friends in the City. UBS
reiterated a sell notice which has been in place for a record-breaking seven
years.
Few houses had any clear idea of where Eurotunnel's trading patterns go from
here. The general consensus was that if another immediate cash call has been
avoided there could yet be painful decisions early in the new year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Spotlight falls on BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The spotlight in the VSEL takeover saga swung away from the submarine maker
yesterday, to beam full square on British Aerospace following weekend press
reports that BAe might itself end up the victim of GEC's huge cash balances.
BAe, which has an agreed offer for VSEL on the table, surged 28 to 498p in
turnover of 5.9m, at which level its market capitalisation is around Pounds
1.87bn. At the last count GEC was known to be sitting on cash funds of some
Pounds 3bn.
GEC, which last week declared itself as a potential counter-bidder for VSEL,
is widely understood to have held talks last year aimed at merging its
defence business with that of BAe.
GEC opted to play its cards close to its chest yesterday, putting out a firm
no comment statement. The shares rose 2 to 295p in turnover which at 3.1m
suggested that the rumour mill was not having too great an effect on
activity.
VSEL dipped 5 to 1320p following half-year results which included an
increased interim dividend and a declaration that September cash balances
stood at Pounds 364m.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures were volatile in dull volume, swinging about erratically
but eventually closing comfortably up on the day, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 18 points higher at 3,140 at the
official 4.10pm close, having touched a 3,163 best for the day towards the
end of the morning session.
At this level the premium to the cash market was around 20 points and the
fair value premium just short of 13 points.
Trading volume was flat, with just 11,811 contracts showing at the official
close, down from an average of 15,000 for the final two days of last week.
Traders said there was very little two-way business and that most deals were
hard to trade. 'Everybody's unsure of direction,' commented one trader.
Futures markets were watching the dollar, as it made its response to the
outcome of the German elections.
On the upside, traders see 3,170 as the most immediate selling point. Wall
Street continues to provide the strongest leads.
Activity in traded options was also light, with 22,778 lots comparing with
34,231 contracts on Friday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for just
over 14,000 lots.
British Aerospace headed the list of active individual options with 1,868
lots dealt. British Steel (1,844 lots) and HSBC were also busy.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rises but mood subdued by
dollar woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks posted modest gains yesterday, but the wider market
languished as fresh weakness in the dollar ensured that overall investor
sentiment remained subdued, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.46 at 3,923.93. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.14 off at 468.96, while
the American SE composite was 0.26 firmer at 458.76 and the Nasdaq composite
down 1.30 at 765.78. Trading volume on the New York SE was a modest 238.5m
shares.
After posting gains totalling more than 100 points last week, the Dow
continued on its upward path yesterday but the advance was not entirely
convincing with secondary indices lagging well behind the blue chip index.
Analysts said there was nothing specific to explain the gains in the Dow
industrials. The mood of the market, however, has been generally positive in
the past week because recent economic and inflation statistics have helped
to ease fears that the Federal Reserve would put up interest rates again
before the month's end. Equity prices have also been buoyed by mostly strong
third-quarter corporate earnings.
The absence of a more broadly based advance was blamed on weakness of the
dollar - which fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday - and on an early
decline in bond prices. By late afternoon, however, the benchmark 30-year
bond had recouped its fall and was back to its opening yield of 7.825 per
cent.
Eastman Kodak retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in volume of 3m
shares amid reports that the company was preparing to embark on another
round of cost cuts in expectation of weak second-half earnings.
General Electric was unchanged at Dollars 50 3/8 and PaineWebber firmed
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 15 on news that GE was selling its troubled Kidder,
Peabody investment banking unit to PaineWebber in a deal that will leave GE
with a 25 per cent stake in the securities firm.
Chemical Waste jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 on news that the
company had signed a definitive merger agreement with WMX Technologies in a
deal that put a higher value on Chemical Waste than had been originally
outlined in a July pact. The news left WMX shares up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars
29 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, California Micro Devices plunged Dollars 6 3/8 to
Dollars 7 1/2 after the company said it was investigating possible
accounting irregularities that could affect its financial results.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar weakness hits bourses
after Kohl victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday's narrow victory for Germany's Conservative/Liberal coalition was
seen as a reassurance for the country's financial markets, and it certainly
seemed to be good for both the D-Mark and bunds, writes Our Markets Staff.
It had less apparent effect on the Frankfurt equity market, but Mr James
Cornish, the NatWest strategist who concentrates on the European political
scene, put this in perspective. 'It is good for equities, too,' he said,
'but they were already up by more than 7 per cent last week.'
Outside Germany, he added, the Kohl win should be good for countries with a
commitment to hard currency; it was probably no coincidence that the usually
sedate Danish equity market posted a rise of 1.5 per cent yesterday.
FRANKFURT's professionals went fishing for more buyers in the early morning,
with prices marked up and a little buying lifting Dax futures. However, the
buyers did not bite and, from an Ibis-indicated high of 2,147.3 in the
morning the market slipped rapidly to close the session 14.85 lower at
2,090.88.
Turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM8.5bn and, in the afternoon, the Dax
recovered a little to 2,095.58. Unfortunately, what was good for the D-Mark
was bad for the dollar, and the malaise of the US currency had its impact on
exporters: there was weakness in chemicals, carmakers and engineering and
metals, with Hoechst down DM5.10 at DM329.50, Daimler by DM15.30 at DM779.70
and Thyssen by DM7.50 at DM290.
However, the losses were not restricted to cyclicals. Deutsche Bank fell
DM12.50 to DM714.50, although it denied a Spiegel report alleging that it
had profited from the oil futures fiasco which drove Metallgesellschaft into
financial disaster. In utilities, Veba fell DM9.80 to DM526 and Viag by
DM9.60 to DM475.
PARIS was pulled down by a number of factors, including a weak currency and
some institutional switching of funds from France into Germany following the
general election there at the weekend. The resignation of a senior member of
the Balladur government was not seen as affecting sentiment, brokers said,
since the decision by the industry minister to quit on allegations of
corruption had been expected.
The CAC-40 index settled down 26.60 or 1.4 per cent at 1,906.42 in turnover
estimated at FFr6bn.
Vehicle and component stocks reflected the market's overall weakness, with
Peugeot off FFr6 at FFr782, Michelin down FFr3.90 at FFr229.10 and Valeo
FFr1.40 lower at FFr280.10. The government said yesterday that institutions
subscribing to the partial privatisation of Renault - pre-marketing begins
today - could be expected to pay between FFr163 to FFr178 per share.
Eurotunnel confirmed forecasts of weak 1994 revenues and the shares lost
FFr1.15 or 6 per cent at FFr17.85.
ZURICH was lower in thin turnover, the SMI index losing 9.7 to 2,575.6 in
response to the weak dollar and profit-taking after last week's advance.
UBS bearers, however, picked up SFr5 to SFr1,290 as the bank continued to
buy its own shares ahead of the extraordinary shareholders meeting on
November 22 at which shareholders will be asked to approve the bank's
planned capital restructuring.
Roche certificates gave up SFr65 to SFr5,835 after the group announced that
third- quarter sales fell 4.7 per cent to SFr3.4bn. Ciba registered dipped
SFr3 to SFr714, while Sandoz, which is expected to announce nine-month
figures next week, fell SFr5 to SFr632.
Export-oriented shares fell prey to the weak US currency, Nestle giving up
SFr7 at SFr1,197.
AMSTERDAM was supported by bonds as the weak dollar threatened to drag
equities lower. The AEX index finished with a modest rise of 0.28 at 408.44,
having seen a day's high of 411.60.
Unilever, up 30 cents to Fl 200.30, attracted interest from Merrill Lynch in
a review of food industry stocks, the broker noting that the stock had the
best performance among European groups in the third quarter. Merrill added
that an estimated p/e of 12 times 1995 earnings did not seem too demanding,
while the company also stood to benefit from its positioning in the world's
emerging economies.
MILAN turned back from early highs amid fresh signs of backtracking by some
ministers over the budget proposals. The Mibtel index finished 24 ahead at
10,143, off a high of 10,288, as teething troubles with the new Mib-30 index
also acted as a disincentive.
Credito Italiano was a bright spot, climbing L45 or 2.6 per cent as it
launched its rights issue to raise L1,500bn and the bank's president said he
had many new projects in mind at a time when the Italian banking system was
about to regroup.
Olivetti was L60 or 3.1 per cent lower at L1,890, although dealers said
there was no news to account for the fall.
TEL AVIV bracketed the Israeli/Jordan peace treaty with two gains of 2.4 per
cent. On Sunday, it liked Friday's Israeli September price index and the
Mishtanim index put on 4.46 at 188.07; yesterday it added a further 4.52 at
192.59.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: European equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's enthusiasm from European equities, led by Finland and Germnay,
stands in stark contrast to an overview from Merrill Lynch which heralds
'the coming collapse in market multiples'.  The US broker's European
strategy team believes that price/earnings ratios in major European equity
markets could halve as they approach peak earnings.  The rise in earnings
would make most of the difference in a fall from p/e estimates, 'in the high
teens to high 20s on average', to 10 or less; but Merrill also thinks that
markets could trend sideways to down for the nect three to five years.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa extends gains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg extended gains in slow trade as the market derived support from
stronger world markets and improved gold price prospects. However, dealers
said that low trading volumes indicated a lack of real interest and that the
medium term direction remained cloudy.
Currencies continued to play their part, with a firmer financial rand
undermining some price rises early in the day.
The overall index collected 28 at 5,655, industrials rose 49 to 6,404 and
golds picked up 12 to 2,300.
De Beers added 10 cents at R101.60, Anglos rose R1 to R238.25 and Minorco
hardened 25 cents to R107. Iscor put on 5 cents at R4.78 and Hiveld climbed
a strong R1.50 to R32.
SAB firmed R1 to R85.75 and Remgro picked up 75 cents to R27. Sappi
registered a fresh high for the year as it appreciated R3 to R66 on
continued positive reaction to its acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD
Warren.
