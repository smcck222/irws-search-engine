Investors remained sidelined as the yen rose to the Y97 level against the
dollar and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground on small-lot arbitrage
selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed 11.00 off at 19,958.29 after a day's high of 20,055.41 and
low of 19,907.68. Arbitrage buying supported shares in the morning, pushing
the index above 20,000, but unwinding of long positions later depressed the
index.
Volume came to 200m shares, against Friday's 397m. The Topix index of all
first section stocks slipped 6.62 to 1,586.46 and the Nikkei 300 shed 1.38
to 289.89. Losers led gainers by 508 to 451, with 195 issues unchanged. In
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.08 to 1,300.35.
The dollar fell below Y98 for the first time since September 26, depressing
investor confidence. While traders said the currency movements failed to
prompt heavy selling, sentiment remained subdued. The US currency was later
supported by intervention from the Bank of Japan.
Electricals were lower, with NEC down Y30 to Y1,230 and Sony losing Y20 at
Y5,950. Foreign selling depressed Sega Enterprises, the video game maker,
with the shares falling Y300 to Y5,030.
Some investors took profits on steels and chemicals which were higher last
week on buying by overseas investors. Mitsubishi Chemical and Kawasaki Steel
dipped Y3 apiece to Y580 and Y445 respectively. However, Nippon Steel moved
up Y1 to Y389 and Ube Industries Y6 to Y430.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, the most active issue of the day, advanced Y16 to
Y995 as speculation that a leading US hedge fund was purchasing gold
prompted individual and dealer buying.
Japan Telecom declined Y10,000 to Y3.89m and East Japan Railway receded
Y1,000 to Y483,000, but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose for the fifth
consecutive day, by Y7,000 to Y893,000.
Textiles gained ground, with Toho Rayon adding Y13 at Y460 and Mitsubishi
Rayon Y5 at Y458.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 38.78 to 22,309.84 in volume of 17.6m
shares. Nippon Shoji fell by its daily limit of Y100 to Y896. Investors sold
the issue after the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the
securities industry watchdog, filed a charge with the Osaka district
prosecutors office last week for alleged insider trading by 32 of the
company's employees.
Roundup
Mixed performances were seen in the Pacific Basin region.
SEOUL continued its forward momentum in brisk trade, the composite index
ending at a record closing high of 1,109.87, up 13.39 or 1.2 per cent.
Brokers commented that a number of positive factors were influencing
investors at present, including prospects for high economic growth and good
company earnings.
TAIPEI was also firmer, led by rises in the food sector, but the weighted
index finished off the day's high, up 35.77 or 0.5 per cent at 6,731.23. The
session's peak was 6,778.34. Turnover totalled TDollars 79.06bn.
In the food sector, President Enterprises went the day's limit up to
TDollars 56 on hopes that the company would make a TDollars 5.5bn to
TDollars 6.2bn profit by selling its stake in affiliate President Chain
Store.
MANILA was supported by property issues and the composite index added 1.7
per cent at 3,050.14. Some brokers observed that investors seemed to be
targeting large manufacturing companies such as Petron and San Miguel.
Turnover amounted to 2bn pesos.
SYDNEY was firmer, although bond weakness dampened sentiment. The All
Ordinaries index was finally up 8.2 at 2,014.2 after touching 2,024.4.
Among the day's leading performers, BHP advanced 24 cents to ADollars 20 and
News Corporation moved ahead 13 cents to ADollars 8.38.
HONG KONG finished just off the day's lows in reaction to a weak dollar and
continuing concern over the health of China's leader Deng Xiaoping.
The Hang Seng index retreated 94.99 to 9,455.94.
The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong fell by 3.2 per
cent, on the back of a drop in Shanghai A shares.
SHANGHAI's A share index fell 50.54 or 7.5 per cent to 627.55 after a local
Communist party newspaper voiced sharp criticism of the media for
irresponsible reporting on the market, brokers said.
Brokers added that the index also fell on fears of a flood of so-called
'legal person' shares, prompted by an exchange announcement that Zibo
Investment Fund would list a portion of its institutionally owned units on
November 4. They will be the first institutional securities on the market.
Most shares in Chinese listed companies are owned by institutions and are
not traded.
KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains to close lower as the market's
consolidation and lack of foreign demand kept a lid on prices.
The composite index eased 2.33 to 1,126.12 in volume of 307.07m shares.
Hong Leong Bank made a striking debut, closing at MDollars 8.75 to give the
stock a MDollars 5.45 premium.
Amalgamated Industrial, the steel products maker, hit the 30 per cent
limit-up in the morning at MDollars 5.70 before the company asked for a
suspension in the afternoon trade.
BOMBAY was lower on sustained selling pressure which left the BSE 30-share
index 21.00 down at 4,365.43.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Markets Report: German elections push dollar to two-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar yesterday fell to a two-year low on the foreign exchanges as
Chancellor Kohl's victory in the German elections lent support to the
D-Mark, writes Philip Gawith.
The dollar's weakness prompted talk of central bank intervention to support
the currency.
Analysts said the re-election of Mr Kohl had removed the last prop of
support for the dollar. Market concerns that the US Federal Reserve is
losing the battle against inflation are also contributing to dollar
weakness.
It closed yesterday in London at DM1.5036, from DM1.5201 on Friday. Earlier
it had touched a low of DM1.4970 in Asian trading, below the previous 1994
low of DM1.5160. Yesterday evening it fell below DM1.50 again in New York
trading. Against the yen it ended in London at Y97.85, from Y98.285. The US
currency finished in New York at DM1.4980 and Y97.65.
The D-Mark's performance was mixed. It finished firmer against the French
franc, at FFr3.434 from FFr3.428, but was weaker against the Belgian franc,
at BFr20.58 from BFr20.61.
The Finnish vote in favour of EU membership lent support to the markka,
which traded at FM3.078 to the D-Mark from Friday's close of FM3.0910.
Sterling was also weaker against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.4168 from
DM2.4207. It was firmer against the dollar, closing at Dollars 1.6074 from
Dollars 1.5925.
In spite of the bearishness surrounding the dollar, trading volumes were not
large. Analysts said customers were confused; many had seen DM1.51/52 as a
potential buying opportunity, but were now put off by the bearish technical
outlook.
Mr Brian Marber, technical analyst, said the dollar's downward break out of
its recent trading range meant 'a very large fall has become possible; I am
expecting an eventual DM1.3910'.
Mr David Cocker, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said the absence of any
profit-taking on the stronger D-Mark was bearish for the dollar; 'this
suggests the dollar has the potential to go lower still'.
This view was echoed by Mr Joe Prendergast, strategist at Paribas capital
markets. He noted: 'The response of the markets reflects the fact that the
last safety net for dollar bulls in 1994 has been removed.'
With the German election result having been largely discounted by the
market, analysts said there had not been any large-scale D-Mark buying.
Although the German election result was the catalyst for the latest bout of
dollar weakness, it is also the victim of market fears about US inflation.
Mr Mike Rosenberg, managing director of international fixed income research
at Merrill Lynch in New York, said the market feared that softer than
expected US economic data last week meant the Federal Reserve would not
raise interest rates immediately.
'But the feeling in the market is that the Fed is already behind the curve,'
he added.
Declaring a 'mini-dollar crisis', Mr Rosenberg said there was evidence that
the US Treasury was setting itself up for intervention to support the
currency. 'We could be within 24 or 48 hours of a significant co-ordinated
effort.'
He said the problem was that the market was already expecting intervention,
and this reduced the prospect of it succeeding. This, in turn, was a reason
not to intervene, because to intervene and to fail was worse than to do
nothing.
Mr Rosenberg said the Fed might be trying to lure the market into believing
it would not intervene. This would encourage traders to establish short
positions, thus increasing the likelihood of successful intervention, as
traders would be forced to cover short positions, adding impetus to the
dollar's recovery.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency strategist at JP Morgan in London, said he
doubted whether the Bundesbank would intervene to curb the D-Mark's advance.
At the moment it was more likely to see the stronger D-Mark as a useful
brake on German growth than as something to be resisted.
In addition, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has said there
remains scope for lower interest rates. These would help to curb the
D-Mark's rally.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 250m of late
assistance. Earlier it had supplied Pounds 677m at established rates, after
forecasting a Pounds 1.15bn shortage.
In Germany, the election result had no market impact on rates, with call
money unchanged at 4.90/95 per cent.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (6): Networks
open to hackers - Alan Cane checks the incidence of computer fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not be surprised by the paucity of published examples of computer fraud.
Perpetrators and victims feel it is in their interests to keep quiet.
Financial institutions, in particular, do not relish admitting that their
systems' security has been compromised.
Fortunately, the danger of 'hackers' breaking into corporate computer
systems is often exaggerated by the press and by security consultants; it is
nevertheless real.
Philip Swallow, a specialist in security with Andersen Consulting, says:
'Hacking is far from being a myth but neither is it endemic. Managers have
to be aware of the risks involved. Computer fraud by its very nature can be
difficult to detect.'
The European Information Technology Observatory (EITO), an organisation of
European IT companies, noted earlier this year: 'With the increasingly
pervasive usage of computers in all contexts and activities, the security of
information and of the systems that manage the information is becoming of
great importance.'
EITO points to two important developments in recent years: the definition of
security standards within the rules devised to allow computers from
different manufacturers to work together (Open Systems Interconnect or OSI)
and the establishment of criteria and rules for the security evaluation of
information technology products.
A critical point is that computer security is relative. It is possible in
theory to create a completely secure system, but cost and inconvenience
would make it unattractive. The level of security implemented represents,
therefore, a balance of business interests.
The diversity of ways of attacking a system lends itself to colourful
descriptions. There are trap doors (part of the software written in such a
way that the security of the system is compromised), Trojan horses (parts of
the software written so the system performs unauthorised and covert
operations), logic bombs (part of the software written to trigger an
operation at a subsequent date) and masquerades or piggy backs where a
fraudulent terminal pretends to have legitimate access to the system.
Most of these attacks depend on a corrupt member or members of the data
processing department. Only a software specialist with intimate knowledge of
a company's software would have the skill and opportunity to insert a trap
door or logic bomb. Systems compromised by trap doors or logic bombs are
difficult to detect; the very complexity of many systems makes it difficult
to check every program and section of computer code.
Attacks on computer systems from the outside are increasing. In one survey
in the UK, about a quarter of the companies questioned said there had been
unauthorised attempts to gain access to their systems. The National
Computing Centre in the UK estimates the average cost of a security breach
to a company is Pounds 9,000.
Alan Stanley of the consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand says the most recent
figures for the UK show that some 40 per cent of companies believe their
systems have been hacked into, although the damage level is low. Some 13 per
cent of mission critical operations had been compromised, but again, little
damage was done.
Measuring the level of security afforded by a computer system has been
simplified by the publication of evaluation criteria. The lead was taken by
the US in 1983 with the Orange Book; it provides essentially a set of
standard security measures for implementation by computer users each with an
indication of the level of confidence afforded.
European users, however, have never been wholly satisfied with the Orange
Book, arguing that it is chiefly geared to military systems. The European
Union has now published its own set of criteria, the White Book, which EITO
says 'could be considered as the beginning of European standards for
evaluating computer trust'. It is, EITO argues, 'one of the most significant
events in the last decade in the European IT security scenario and it might
cover the shortcomings and gaps of the Orange Book'.
The White Book evaluates systems in terms of their functionality and
effectiveness, with special reference to database management, process
control, exchange data integrity, high confidentiality and high integrity
environments.
The fact remains that computer systems, no matter how secure, greatly
increase the possibilities for fraud. Funds can be moved virtually
instantaneously anywhere in the world through computer networks. Is fraud on
the increase? There is a simple, positive correlation between the level of
fraud, the number of computers in use, the number of people who have
knowledge of and access to computers and the number of termin-als attached
to computers.
The Internet, the world's largest computer network with more than 25m users,
represents a special case. Designed as a channel of electronic communication
between scientists and technologists, it was intended to be as accessible as
possible. There is little in the way of built-in security. Earlier this year
thousands of Internet passwords were stolen giving the thieves access to
secret messages and files.
Now that commercial companies are taking an interest in the Internet for
communications, the question of security is more than academic. Managers are
becoming interested in electronic 'firedoors', methods of preventing
security lapses on the Internet from compromising their systems. An example
would be a minicomputer controlling access to the Internet, collecting and
authenticating messages.
Encryption is one way to make electronic messages secure but it is
controversial. The US administration was forced to abandon efforts to
introduce a special encryption chip, the 'Clipper', which would have allowed
pc users to protect themselves from hackers and fraudsters. Developed by the
National Security Agency and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, its use would have allowed secret service personnel to decrypt
the messages.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (7): Track record
raises doubts - John Mason examines the effectiveness of the Serious Fraud
Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The future of the Serious Fraud Office, set up in 1988 to spearhead the
fight against financial crime in the UK, is highly uncertain.
Question marks over its track record recently prompted a government review
which recommended a merger between the SFO and the lower profile fraud
investigation group (Fig) of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
If the review's conclusions are adopted, the SFO would be subsumed into the
CPS. To some observers this would appear an admission that the original
conception of an elite department to combat the most complex cases of
financial fraud has failed.
The attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, is now considering the merger
proposal. At the same time, he will decide on parallel proposals for both
the SFO and CPS to be turned into executive agencies outside the civil
service as part of the government's plans to streamline Whitehall. Sir
Nicholas is expected to announce his conclusions on the proposed merger by
the end of the year.
So what has gone wrong? The SFO was set up with unique powers and structure
to bring an increased effectiveness to the investigation and prosecution of
complex financial crime. Its brief is to tackle those cases which involve
considerable sums of money (more than Pounds 5m) and are of a particularly
complex nature.
Unlike the CPS, it handles both the investigation and prosecution stages -
although detection remains the responsibility of the police and City
regulatory bodies. Its multidisciplinary structure, in which lawyers,
accountants and police are supposed to pool their skills, is intended to
increase the effectiveness of its investigations. Finally, it was given
unique powers in Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to remove the
right to silence and compel witnesses to give evidence.
With these powers and structure, the SFO was supposed to be able to tackle
complex fraud cases that had proved virtually impossible for police fraud
squads working on their own to handle. However, as has been documented
exhaustively in the press, the SFO's track record since its inception has
been mixed.
Its initial success in the Guinness trial, when four prominent City figures
were convicted over the 1986 takeover of Distillers, proved the high point.
Since then, headlines have been restricted to reporting failures such the
Blue Arrow trial, after which the SFO was criticised by the Court of Appeal
for the size and unmanageability of of the prosecution, and the fiasco over
Mr Roger Levitt, the financial services salesman who served 180 hours'
community service after agreeing to a widely criticised plea-bargaining with
the prosecution.
Lawyers involved in defence and prosecution work agree that not all the
responsibility for such failures should be laid at the door of the SFO. The
legal system that the SFO has to operate within still has crucial failings
in its ability to present fraud cases that are tried by a jury. For example,
there is common agreement that within the judiciary there are all too few
judges with the necessary experience of both commercial and criminal cases
to handle such difficult cases.
Equally, George Staple, the SFO director, insists that efforts have been
made to learn from previous mistakes, notably on bringing to court cases
that are too large and unwieldy.
However, its past failings and the consequent bad publicity has proved
highly damaging for the SFO. It has had its success stories - such as the
four successful prosecutions which followed the large-scale investigation
into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International - but these are
less well reported.
The result has been that the SFO has found itself in a similar position to
that of the beleaguered Child Support Agency - forced on to the defensive by
a poor public image it is finding difficult to reverse. The question of
public perception - rightly or wrongly acquired - is one that the
attorney-general will have to consider. For the SFO to be effective, it is
widely agreed, it has to be widely seen to be a credible organisation.
Perception aside, the initial review of the workings of the SFO and Fig
concluded there are sound reasons for a merger of the two bodies. It found
that there is considerable overlap in the work they carry out and that it is
anomalous to apply different methods to what amount to very similar cases.
This problem has been enhanced over the past year because the number and
size of cases referred to the SFO has dropped significantly, leaving it to
pick up smaller cases that would previously have been dealt with by Fig.
The review also found room for improvement in the management of both bodies.
The SFO, it reported, was not fully exploiting its current systems and
lacked formal management overview of important decisions.
It did, however, conclude that the 'Section 2' powers removing the right to
silence had proved an effective weapon.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (5): Is there a
spy in your boardroom? - Industrial espionage is a growing problem in
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there a turner in the boardroom? This question, being increasingly asked
by big and small companies around the world, has nothing to do with art
collections but is concerned with the growing problem of industrial
espionage.
Industrial espionage can be defined as virtually any technique aimed at
taking a company's secrets. Although electronic surveillance or computer
hacking more often grab the headlines, the most common form of industrial
espionage is for a rival company to employ an insider - or a turner in the
trade jargon - to give them inside information.
Industrial espionage is increasingly worrying executives in highly
competitive areas of industry. High-tech businesses such as aerospace,
engineering, computers and telecommunications are frequent victims but
companies in other fields, where marketing or advertising strategies may be
as important as new product information, are also suffering.
Behind the phenomenon is the large financial advantage that a rival company
may gain from a timely insight into a competitor's product ideas or
marketing plans.
'Why should a company spend Pounds 100m on research and development when it
can gain the relevant knowledge from a rival for a much smaller outlay?'
asks Peter Heims, a British security consultant.
According to Paul Carratu, managing director of Carratu International, a
London-based fraud investigator, the most common form of industrial
espionage concerns disaffected employees offering this type of information
to a rival for a fee.
'More often than not you see the opportunist approach where the employee
makes the information available via an intermediary such as a security
company. It is less common to see the more direct approach where a rival
goes out actively to seek the information through bugging or similar means,'
says Mr Carratu.
It follows, therefore, that the most sensible ways to try to stop industrial
espionage are through common sense tactics that are really nothing more than
an extension of good management. Among these are restricting access to
sensitive product or marketing information; keeping a check on documents
that could be of value to a rival; and trying to sort out personal problems
involving employees before the person affected becomes so disgruntled that
he or she even thinks of starting to hawk secrets to competitors.
Of course, deciding on where to draw the line on potentially sensitive
information may be highly tricky. There is a story much recounted among
industrial espionage investigators of a company that, in the cause of
improving communications with its employees, revealed detailed marketing
information about a new product launch in its internal company newspaper
several weeks before the product appeared. Not surprisingly, the details
leaked out to a competitor and the company launched an industrial espionage
probe which ultimately led to the dismissal of the newspaper's unfortunate
editor.
The point underlines the fact that industrial espionage covers a wide
spectrum.
One estimate of the extent of industrial espionage is that about half of all
big companies may have had secret information leaked over the past decade by
some form of espionage. The phenomenon is relatively widespread in the US,
France and Italy, according to Mr Carratu. 'There is less industrial
espionage in Britain: in the UK it's thought not to be ethical to indulge in
this kind of thing,' he says.
Understandably enough, most companies hit byindustrial espionage do not like
to talk about it. But in recent years the businesses affected have included
BP and Shell, which suffered as a result of outsiders gaining access to
secret tender information for engineering contracts through the information
leaking out via an unscrupulous marketing agent. Volkswagen and General
Motors have recently been locked in a long-running battle over allegations
by the US company that its rival 'stole' secrets - allegedly channelled to
the German car maker by the defection to Volkswagen of Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, a Spaniard who had been running GM's worldwide parts purchasing
operations. SKF, the Swedish ball-bearing company, also recently suffered an
embarrassing loss of its new product plans which was later traced to a
disgruntled employee.
Electronic surveillance is a method frequently used by competitors to gain
access to secrets. A rival boardroom can be bugged - perhaps using the
services of a person contracted for this purpose who uses the 'cover' of
working for a cleaning company - with an instrument the size of a matchbox
and costs no more than Pounds 100. Such devices, with tiny microphones and
which transmit over perhaps a quarter of a mile, can be very difficult to
spot if cleverly hidden.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (8): Wall
Street's private eye / Profile of Kroll Associates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kroll Associates, the world's leading corporate investigative agency, has
not generally been shy of publicity. They have managed to present an image
of a dynamic sleuthing operation, whose success has bred an impressive
client list which includes governments and leading companies.
However, in recent months the agency's founder and majority owner, former
New York prosecutor Jules Kroll, has been on the defensive, fighting off
rumours of significant internal problems and creeping financial
difficulties.
The suggestion of something approaching an organisational haemorrhage has
been fuelled by a spate of high-level resignations and the threat of more to
come.
In an interview published in the New York Times early in September, Mr Kroll
blamed unnamed competitors for spreading false rumours about the financial
condition of his company which, in turn, had provoked a round of crisis
management at Kroll itself.
Most of those who have left say their reason for going was to set up their
own smaller, private investigation agencies.
Mr Kroll and the remaining senior executives insist that the resignations do
not signify the beginning of the end. In London, Kroll's senior man, Thomas
Helsby, boasts of a 'critical mass of experience' among its staff which can
without difficulty absorb and overcome the temporary setback of the
resignations.
Not only has Kroll managed to hang on to many of its talented investigators
on a full-time and freelance basis, it retains what it considers one of its
biggest assets: a highly developed in-house data system. As one competitor
reluctantly conceded: 'Kroll has a powerful armoury of research capability.'
Mr Helsby, with characteristic bullishness, says: 'Our business is growing
and growing, adding on new things all the time. This office is having the
best year it has ever had.'
In New York, Mr Kroll has published figures showing that his company has
remained profitable with a pretax profit margin of about 12 per cent.
Revenues are expected to exceed Dollars 60m this year compared to Dollars
40m in 1990, with an increase in clients over the past four years of 78 per
cent.
What Kroll executives are not prepared to counter with any conviction is the
widely aired view held by its competitors that the agency may in one sense
have fallen victim to its own success: its turnover is being badly dented by
disputed debts on at least two highly publicised cases.
In August, it emerged in New York that Kroll was suing the family of the
late Italian banker Roberto Calvi for non-payment of Dollars 3m. Kroll,
which has filed a court action in the US, hopes it will recover the money as
well as recoup the legal costs it will incur.
Rather more problematical is the non-payment of an even larger sum believed
to stem from a contract with the Russian government. It is estimated the
contract may have cost Kroll up to Dollars 4.7m.
The extent of the hurt caused by the setbacks, depends on whether the
company can continue to diversify.
Following its formation in 1972, Kroll established itself fairly quickly as
Wall Street's private eye, specialising in investigations involving mergers
and acquisitions. With the recession, Kroll has cast an increasingly wide
net to attract clients.
It still considers due diligence reports on companies part of its core work,
along with fraud investigations, but its target is to become an unrivalled
international provider of planning and analysis on every aspect of security
and risk management.
Mr Kroll hopes to quadruple his firm's revenues by the end of the decade,
building on its partnership with the US insurance company American
International Group (AIG bought 23 per cent of Kroll last year).

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (4): Exploiting
the EU loopholes - The incidence of false accounting in the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something is rotten in the rapidly evolving mega-state of Europe. The stale
odour of systematic fraud is persistently leaking from investigations of the
European Union's financial arrangements, but so far there has been little
concrete remedial action.
Expert opinion is that up to 10 per cent of the EU's budget of Ecu70bn
(Dollars 87bn) a year is diverted to the wrong recipients either through
fraud or improper exploitation of financial loopholes. The exact figure is
impossible to calculate because most fraud is undetected. However, Lord Hunt
of Tamworth, a former top-ranking UK civil servant who served as cabinet
secretary and who is chairman of the House of Lords' European communities
committee, does not dispute the 10 per cent figure.
In July, Lord Hunt's committee issued a damning report on EU fraud which
said: 'We have increasingly come to the conclusion that most fraud in the EU
happens because the administrative procedures and financial controls are not
lucidly defined by community legislation, and because the procedures and
controls (in member states) are defective. There is no central
responsibility in the European Commission for ensuring that new regulations
and schemes are foolproof and this is far from being the prime consideration
in the policy-making directorates (of the commission).'
Most fraud involving EU spending follows directly from the extreme
complexity of the rules for channelling money from Brussels to member states
for projects such as infrastructure programmes or supporting food prices.
This makes it relatively easy for fraudsters - who can range from highly
organised criminal gangs to opportunist individuals taking occasional
advantage of an EU loophole - to make a financial gain.
This can happen, for example, through a farmer applying for an extra subsidy
on, say, a cotton shipment simply by filling in a form saying he has grown
10 per cent more than he really has. Behind many of the frauds discovered
over the past few years have been such cases of falsified documentation,
sometimes created with the connivance of government officials in the state
where the act is taking place. Indeed, a factor which may help the fraudster
is that often the country where he or she is operating may see no particular
advantage in combating the fraud. The government involved may be willing to
turn a Nelsonian eye to evidence of what is taking place on the grounds that
the cash from Brussels is boosting the local economy whether or not it is
being spent according to the letter of EU rules.
At the level of the European Commission itself, officials operate within a
culture where it is the spending of money that is all important, not the
monitoring of the extent to which the spending achieves agreed objectives.
Operating along these lines, Brussels officials frequently become
embarrassed when the subject of fraud crops up. In many ways they are as
reluctant as are some member governments to discuss the incidence of fraud
and how to tackle it. This is because raising the subject may irritate the
member government where the alleged fraud is taking place and may be seen to
be against the co-operative spirit driving the union.
Italy is one of the focal points of fraud investigations. Italian
prosecutors recently alleged that Filippo Galli, the head of the state
organisation overseeing EU agriculture subsidies, took bribes from a big
grain trader to ignore evidence of massive corruption. In one instance
documented by Uclaf, the European Commission's anti-fraud unit, traders
claimed a subsidy of Ecu76m (Dollars 94m) for a large shipment of wheat
which supposedly was kept in intervention storage in a government warehouse
but which inquiries indicated did not exist.
In another recent case, sugar traders in Belgium are thought to have gained
about Ecu6m in extra subsidies by claiming to have transferred a large
quantity of this commodity out of the EU to states in the former Soviet
Union, so qualifying for an export refund, whereas the sugar was really sold
at high prices in Spain.
What is being done about EU fraud? Several moves are afoot, though the
effect of these actions may turn out to be fairly slight. Uclaf, which has a
new director, Per Brix Knudsen, an energetic and outspoken Danish customs
officer, is doubling its staff to 100 by the end of the year and promises to
be more diligent in detecting fraud cases and bringing miscreants to justice
through co-operation with national authorities.
Second, the EU's agricultural aid programme, which accounts for half the
total EU spending and is thought to account for the lion's share of fraud,
is being radically changed to cut down on subsidies overall and to change
the direction of subsidies towards farmers rather than traders and
processing companies where opportunities for false accounting are greatest.
Third, the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's financial watchdog,
is becoming more eager to highlight cases of fraud or improper action.
However, most of its deliberations and actions are kept secret. The court
also lacks the self-confidence to take the initiative on big cases of fraud
or financial mismanagement, and as a result its power to influence the broad
picture on fraud is limited.
It seems that the efforts to improve the EU's far from impressive record on
combating fraud can only really come from the centre, via the commissioners
installed in Brussels by the member governments. Much will therefore depend
on how the new crop of commissioners, easing into their positions over the
next few months, approach a subject which is certain to command an
increasing amount of attention from outside pressure groups and from
taxpayers concerned that their cash is being misspent.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (3): Mafia gangs
target the west - The former Soviet Union / Jimmy Burns on fears of money
laundering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are increasing fears among regulators and law enforcement agencies
that so-called Russian Mafia networks may be penetrating western financial
systems with the object of laundering their illicit cash.
The break-up of the Soviet Union has brought in its wake a huge flight of
capital estimated by senior bankers to be as much as Dollars 1bn a month. It
has also led to a proliferation of gangs involved in financial corruption
and illegal trade whose operations threaten to extend well beyond the former
Soviet Union states.
These fears were voiced in July this year by Albert Pacey, the
director-general of the UK's National Criminal Intelligence Service, during
a visit to Moscow and in evidence to a House of Commons committee.
British police believe that although Russian gangsters are most active in
eastern Europe and Germany, there are indications that they may move their
operations to other parts of western Europe.
The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) refuses to discuss
specific cases. However, last year under new regulations requiring banks and
other institutions to report 'suspicious financial transactions', there were
13,000 cases reported to NCIS of which 200 involved Russians.
'That is not a large number, but what distinguished the Russian cases were
the amounts involved - from Pounds 500,000 to several million pounds,' says
Mr Pacey.
An NCIS briefing paper earlier this year states that 'the nations of eastern
and central Europe and the former Soviet Union have enormous potential to
impact significantly upon Europe and the United Kingdom . . . the situation
in the Russian Federation continues to give particular cause for concern.'
According to NCIS, the significance of the UK in terms of criminal groups
emanating from the Soviet Union and eastern Europe is that 'UK financial
institutions, over a long period, are being used for the transfer of large
sums of illicit funds'.
NCIS identified four areas for potentially illicit transactions emanating
from the former Soviet Union:
Laundering of funds from 'general criminal activity' including extortion;
Laundering of funds involving trade in high-technology equipment;
Laundering of funds from the sale of weapons, commodities, and precious
metals, including radio-active material; and
The transfer to the west of former Communist Party funds.
The extent to which regulatory authorities in the west are managing to curb
these illicit activities remain unknown. Theoretically, any unusual cash
transfers to the UK emanating from the former Soviet Union should be brought
to the attention of the Bank of England, while Russian businessmen wishing
to set up a trading operation in the UK are subject to immigration controls.
In practice, according to some senior bankers, some Russians may be taking
advantage of areas such as the property business, which is not subject to
significant institutional controls. They may also be using offshore centres
to confuse investigators tracking money flows.
Ray King, finance director of Chartwell International (UK), a financial
consultancy firm which specialises in the former Soviet Union, says part of
the problem for regulators in the west is identifying what amounts of
Russian flight capital actually emanate from criminal activity.
'If you are a western bank it is very difficult to know what the current
rules and regulations are regarding capital export from the former Soviet
Union,' says Mr King.
He believes that it is difficult to prove that any of the Russians who are
investing in property in London or setting up trading companies are engaging
in illegal activity 'although there are clearly a few cowboys who are
bending the rules'.
There is certainly some evidence suggesting that the problem may be even
graver. According to other banking sources, some trading companies in the UK
have in recent months been approached by individuals in the former Soviet
Union with known connections with the criminal fraternity who asked them to
arrange for transfers running into several millions of pounds. Meanwhile,
some estate agents are thought to have refused to proceed with contracts
with Russians after becoming suspicious about the amount of money available
and the dubious nature of references given.
Few money transfers, however, involve a direct transaction between the
former Soviet Union and the UK. One area of concern to regulators is the
financial offshore centre of Cyprus where numerous 'brass-plate' Russian
companies have been set up together with banks to facilitate hard currency
deposits by businessmen and officials. There are suspicions that some of the
Cyprus-based companies - with on-transfers to other financial centres such
as Switzerland - are being used to launder illegal profits from activities
such as arms smuggling, prostitution, and bogus trade deals.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (2): Greater
alertness uncovers more cases - Money Laundering / Ian Rodger discusses
reasons why the frequency of this crime has increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money laundering has suddenly become among the most frequent of crimes being
attacked by law enforcement officers and politicians.
Scarcely a week goes by without a fresh call to action being issued against
this most discreet of crimes.
And scarcely a week goes by without a new case of money laundering coming to
light or being prosecuted. It even figured in the recent macabre case of
more than 50 religious cult-related deaths in Switzerland and Canada.
The two trends are of course related. The increased focus on the problem has
made banks and law enforcers more sensitive to it, thus leading to greater
surveillance and more discoveries.
According to recent estimates by US and UK officials, the amount of money
laundered every year amounts to roughly Dollars 500bn. This money is the
fuel that keeps organised crime going and growing, mainly in support of the
international drug trade but also for various other sophisticated crimes,
from insider trading to the traffic in nuclear materials.
The attack on money laundering only became serious in the 1980s, mainly
because of the expanding drug business. And there are still several
loopholes or weak points within the international financial system, some of
them bizarre.
For example, in the US, which probably still tops the world money laundering
league table, a 1970 Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to report
suspicious transactions. But wire transfers, the most common form of
transaction, are excluded from this requirement.
In theory, money laundering should be relatively easy to prevent. If banks
and other financial institutions deal only with customers they know and if
they monitor carefully certain types of potentially suspicious transactions,
they should be able to keep out big-time financial criminals.
That is the rationale behind a plethora of guidelines and recommendations
that have been issued by various international organisations in recent
years.
Starting in 1988, the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices issued a recommendation calling on banks to make 'reasonable
efforts' to determine the true identity of customers.
The following year, the group of seven leading industrial countries set up a
Financial Action Task Force to study ways of curbing money laundering. FATF
has since established guidelines for national financial systems and carried
out audits of several leading countries.
A European Council 1991 directive on the prevention of the use of the
financial system for the purpose of money laundering came into effect
throughout the European Union at the beginning of last year. It obliges all
financial institutions to know the true identity of their clients and to
report any suspicious transactions to the police.
Money launderers tend to use large financial centres or tax havens to try
and disguise routes to the sources of their earnings.
It is in places such as Switzerland, the City of London or New York that
they are likely to find a few bent bankers willing to help them.
In an attempt to preserve their reputations, these centres have been among
the most aggressive in introducing laws and guidelines to prevent money
laundering.
The Swiss Federal Banking Commission, for example, issued detailed
guidelines in 1992 outlining no fewer than 30 specific transactions -
withdrawals, purchase of drafts, transfers or excessive cash movements -
that should be regarded as suspicious.
This year, a new law has broken the conflict between Switzerland's bank
secrecy provisions and criminal investigations. Bankers may now report
substantial suspicions of criminal activities by their clients to state
prosecutors. This is, in fact, tantamount to an obligation. Failure to do so
would be regarded by the banking commission as negligence.
Switzerland has also made insider trading, money laundering and membership
in a criminal organisation criminal offences, thus bringing them within the
orbit of crimes on which it is willing to co-operate with law enforcers from
other countries.
With this sort of tightening occurring in most western countries, the focus
has in the past couple of years moved eastward and southward.
Money launderers were quick to realise that the former Warsaw pact and
Soviet Union countries, with no experience of financial markets and with a
desperate need for hard currency, were easy victims.
There is also believed to have been a large flow of ill-gotten funds from
former Communist officials to western banks.
In June, Treuhandanstalt, the industrial reconstruction agency for eastern
Germany, launched a civil action in Zurich against the Swiss subsidiary of
Bank Austria.
It claimed that agents of the former East German Communist Party stashed
Sch1.76bn (Dollars 162m) there in the spring of 1991 as the German
Democratic Republic collapsed. Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, has
denied the charges.
In September, EU finance ministers met with their central and eastern
European counterparts in Berlin and, among other things, urged the eastern
countries to tighten their laws and regulations against money laundering.
Meanwhile, the noose appears to be tightening on the tax havens of the
Caribbean. In January, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Britain's
Scotland Yard set up a joint task force to fight white-collar crime in the
UK dependent territories.
The British Government has also recently reprimanded Gibraltar for not
implementing the EU directive on money laundering.
Such is the momentum that several speakers at an international symposium on
economic crime at Cambridge University in England in September recommended
that economic sanctions be imposed on countries that do not combat money
laundering seriously.
The idea was backed by a number of delegates attending the symposium. John
Moscow, New York's assistant district attorney, said: 'It is an idea whose
time has come.'
All of this activity does not mean that money laundering is going to
disappear in the near future. Even if new criminals are rebuffed by banks,
it is going to take them some time to clear their books of long-standing
dubious customers.
This problem was highlighted by a case earlier this year in which a Dollars
150m account of a suspected Colombian drug dealer came to light at the Union
Bank of Switzerland. It had remained undetected for several years partly
because there had been very few transactions into or out of it.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Survey of Fraud - Prevention and Detection (1): Focus on
financial crimes sharpens - The first national fraud forum this week comes
at a time when the incidence of this crime in business is rising steadily
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first national fraud forum, bringing together representatives of the
police, regulatory agencies, and private sector investigators, is being held
this week.
The three-day event, organised by the Association of Chief Police Officers
(Acpo), will bring together all groups interested in the fight against this
growing crime for the first time, to discuss how to improve prevention and
investigation procedures.
It comes, moreover, at a time when companies and the government are
increasingly aware of the penalties of failing to implement effective
procedures to prevent fraud.
The government has this year been considering introducing plastic identity
cards to replace benefit books, in an attempt to save some or all of the
hundreds of millions of pounds lost every year in social security fraud.
Meanwhile, a growing number of companies has implemented much tighter
internal auditing procedures, in a bid to detect possible frauds at a much
earlier stage.
Fraud comes in so many different forms - from the company director who uses
company funds to take his partner on holiday to the wholesale theft of
hundreds of millions by the corrupt Bank of Credit and Commerce
International - that it is notoriously difficult to define.
It is not explicitly described in criminal law, but in practice it is
treated by the authorities as a sophisticated form of theft, usually
involving deceit to obtain funds. Prosecution is normally carried out under
the 1968 Theft Act.
Detailed statistics on the national scale of fraud are equally elusive, but
Network Security Management, the fraud investigation business controlled by
the merchant bank Hambros, estimates that companies on average lose between
2 per cent and 5 per cent of their turnover as a result of fraud.
An attempt at obtaining more precise statistics has been made by the
investigation arm of accountants, Ernst &amp; Young. Its survey in 1992 of 100
companies, covering most industrial and commercial sectors, found that 24
per cent had reported a fraud costing more than Pounds 250,000 at least once
in the previous two years and that 30 per cent had reported a fraud
exceeding Pounds 50,000 in the same period. More than a third had suffered a
fraud but not notified the authorities.
Banks in particular have been particularly reluctant to report frauds,
fearing publicity would damage the confidence of their customers.
Ernst &amp; Young has recently completed another survey of these 100 companies:
98 per cent believed that there had either been no diminution, or a rise in
the incidence of fraud over the past two years.
In its assessment of reported frauds KPMG Peat Marwick's fraud investigation
unit identified 27 significant cases involving the attempted theft of Pounds
254m in the first six months of 1994, a larger number than in the whole of
1991.
These increases are perhaps surprising, since the level of fraud which comes
to light usually rises as the economy goes into recession, falling back
again as the economy recovers, as at present.
There are probably two reasons for the counter-cyclical trend. First, a
company hit by tougher trading conditions may resort to fraud to prop itself
up - the motive widely ascribed to the late Robert Maxwell for his decision
to plunder his companies' pension schemes. Second, honest companies facing
tough times may examine their costs more closely - and in the process detect
hitherto hidden frauds.
The specific types of fraud showing the greatest increases, according to
Detective Superintendent John Probert and other experts, are insurance,
mortgage and banking frauds, such as advance fee fraud.
All three are simple in concept. Mortgage fraud, for example, usually
involves overstatement of the purchase price of a property, so that a bank
or building society lends more than the actual price - with the difference
being pocketed. Earlier this year, charges alleging a Pounds 100m fraud were
brought against one group of development companies after a three-year
investigation.
The apparent abundance of work has led to a sharp increase in the number of
private sector firms involved in giving advice on prevention, as well as the
detection and recovery of lost funds. As a result, the market has become far
more competitive.
At the same time, the services offered by some less scrupulous firms - and
the methods they use - threatens to sully the image of all. Some agencies
advertise openly that they can obtain confidential details of bank accounts,
credit card records or medical information, for modest fees.
However, for police fraud squads the greatest challenge is how to do the job
effectively while having to compete against other policing priorities for
increasingly scarce resources.
There are 850 officers involved in fighting fraud throughout the UK, with
the biggest single unit, the London-based Metropolitan Fraud Squad,
employing 150 policemen and a further 40 people in support services.
The Metropolitan Police Fraud Squad, working in partnership with other
agencies, and with an annual budget of Pounds 10m last year, recovered more
than Pounds 20m in cash and securities obtained by fraudsters, compared with
Pounds 10.6m in the previous year.
The Met claims to have prevented frauds worth Pounds 6.57bn in the twelve
months to March 31, 1994. However, this figure is slightly misleading
because it includes one unusually big case: a Pounds 6.5bn attempted fraud
on the Agricultural Bank of China.
Persistent and widespread criticism of the Serious Fraud Office, which was
set up in 1988 to lead the battle against the most complex and substantial
forms of financial crime has to some extent undermined morale in the
official fraud agencies. The SFO was given large financial and staff
resources including lawyers and accountants as well as policemen.
Because the government believed that the fight against fraud presented very
different challenges from those presented by other kinds of crime, the SFO
was made independent of the Crown Prosecution Service, handling both
investigations and prosecutions. Detection has remained, however, the
responsibility of the police and City of London regulatory authorities, such
as the Stock Exchange and the Bank of England. The SFO was also given unique
powers in Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to remove a suspect's
right to silence and compel witnesses to give evidence.
However, its handling of some high-profile cases - notably the Blue Arrow
trial and the prosecution of the financial services salesman, Roger Levitt -
has been clumsy, and its future is under review by the government. Officials
believe it could be merged with its less glamorous sister, the Fraud
Investigation Group, under the umbrella of the Crown Prosecution Service. An
announcement is likely before the end of the year.
The multi-disciplinary approach which the SFO applies - combining the skills
of police, accountants and lawyers - is likely to be increasingly adopted by
agencies and firms involved in the fight against fraud, whether they are
private sector or public sector.
Building those bridges between different institutions with their different
skills will be the focus of the forum this week.
According to some experts, such co-operation between the police and private
sector firms could one day lead to privatisation of some of the fraud
squads' activities.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine expects lowest grain
harvest in over a decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine, the former Soviet Union's bread basket blessed with exceptionally
fertile soil, yesterday announced it expects this year's grain harvest to be
the lowest in over a decade.
The gross harvest, including corn, will stand at 37.7m tonnes this year,
6.4m less than expected and a 17 per cent drop on last year's 45.6m tonne
harvest, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
However, Mr Viktor Gluzdeyev, a government spokesman, told Interfax-Ukraine
news agency yesterday that Ukraine does not plan to make up the gap with
imports and that the harvest is sufficient to meet domestic demand.
The large state-run sectors produced a 35m tonne harvest yield, short of an
expected 40.7m tonnes. The tiny private farms showed slightly better average
yields.
Overall, average grain yields will be 28.6 centners per hectare, roughly
half western European levels.
The blame for the lower yields - the spring crop was also down 40 per cent -
rests partly on a drought this year and on the slow pace of Ukraine's
attempts to overhaul the agricultural sector, which is ruled by powerful
lobbies.
Declining production might jump start reform, however. Structural changes
urged by the World Bank include land reform, privatisation of food
processing and farm infrastructure such as grain silos, and liberalisation
of domestic trade in products.
Experts say reforms are needed to improve incentives for farmers who are
currently forced to sell at low state-set prices, and to restructure the
inefficient collectives still dominant in Ukraine.
Mr Neil Spooner, an agricultural consultant, said the fault lies with the
government's controls on prices and trade, not with farmers or the land,
since average yields at state and private farms are half those achieved on
farms participating in joint-ventures with western firms.
A Ukrainian government spokesman this week outlined plans to eventually put
60 per cent of land in public hands - the state currently owns 93 per cent.
Subsidies to Ukraine's agricultural sector eat up half the state's annual
budget and feed inflation. Economic advisers argue farming can survive
without the credits and even compete on western markets.
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma in a policy speech last week endorsed farm
reform, including plans to decentralise control within powerful ministries
such as agriculture.
'The key to the realisation of real reform in Ukraine is agriculture,' he
said.

Dutch agriculture must go on the offensive if it is to maintain its leading
position in European and world exports, according to Mr Jozias van Aartsen,
agriculture minister in the new Dutch government.
Mr Aarsten's call for action, made last week, follows the publication of a
report showing that farmers, horticulturists and livestock breeders are
losing their reputation for quality and failing to respond to changes in
European demand.
The minister urged farmers, agricultural produce boards and other
organisations in the sector to come up with ideas for a response to the
report's findings by the end of the year.
The report, compiled by the consultants AT Kearney at the ministry's
request, concludes that the agricultural sector - a key motor of the Dutch
economy, accounting for 26 per cent of exports - is lagging competitors in
countries such as France and Denmark.
'In the mid-1980s the Dutch agri-sector was a textbook example of efficiency
and quality. Since then it has changed into a bulk producer with low product
variety,' the report said.
The Netherlands' competitive position in cut-flowers and seeds remains
strong, but this is not enough to compensate for weaker performances in the
dairy, vegetable and pork sectors.
The consultants argue that the Netherlands' relative decline in European
market share has been masked by continued increases in the value and volume
of agricultural sales.
One of the main factors behind the decline is the failure by Dutch
agriculture to respond effectively to the demand for a greater range of
products and product specifications, particularly from Europe's increasingly
powerful food retail groups.
In the dairy sector, for example, the report cited criticism by retailers of
Dutch cheese-makers, which have scored just one success over the past 15
years: the launch of Leerdammer cheese.
By contrast, the Danish and the French have turned their attention to feta
and mozzarella cheeses to take advantage of the popularity of Mediterranean
products.
The Dutch, unlike the Germans and French, also seem to have missed the
growth of European demand for new desserts.
One reason for the lack of innovative skill seems to be a conflict of
interest within the Netherlands' agricultural co-operatives.
At dairy co-operatives, the owners - the farmers - want high prices for
their milk. But the co-operatives would be able to make more long-term
investments in research and development of new products if raw material
prices fell, the report said.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcoa says avoid rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employees of Aluminium Company of America, the world's biggest aluminium
group, have been told to stay away from meetings where competitors are
likely to be present.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman, made this edict following the recent decision by
the US Justice Department to investigate whether US aluminium producers
broke antitrust laws when they cut production after government
representatives from some of the major aluminium-producing regions signed an
unprecedented Memorandum of Understanding in February.
Alcoa insisted that Mr O'Neill's instruction did not arise from any
heightened concern about the antitrust inquiry. Mr O'Neill said in his note
to senior managers he was sure no employee had engaged in any improper
conduct. Nevertheless: 'It is prudent to take into account the possibility
of changing standards of enforcement and compliance by governmental agencies
as administrations change. As a responsible company we want to assure the
reduction of any risks arising from misunderstandings regarding contacts
with competitors.' In future, employees would need explicit permission to
attend any meeting where rival companies would be represented.
However, Alcoa has told the US Aluminium Association and the International
Primary Aluminium Institute it will continue to supply them with statistics.
The Justice Department investigation surprised the industry because three
department lawyers were present to advise on the memorandum. Alcan of Canada
and the European Aluminium Association have also been asked to co-operate in
the department's inquiry.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Copper highly volatile - Market
Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COPPER fluctuated wildly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, reaching
Dollars 2,520 a tonne at one stage before closing Dollars 5 down from Friday
at Dollars 2,476.50. There was a Dollars 5 a tonne premium for metal for
immediate delivery compared with three-month aluminium at the close and that
backwardation (premium) reached a notional Dollars 50 at one point. Traders
said the bulk of the activity reflected 'third Wednesday' pricing and
trading, and covering against nearby option commitments. Big cash purchases
defended the Dollars 2,500 level in the morning before heavy Far Eastern
selling and fund liquidation established the lower trend, they said.
ALUMINIUM prices reached a new four-year high of Dollars 1,720 a tonne
before closing at Dollars 1,715.50, up Dollars 7.75.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian rain sends coffee
futures lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Coffee futures rebounded from a sharp setback in volatile trading yesterday,
affected by rainfall that has relieved a long drought in Brazil, the world's
biggest producer.
In London, the January robusta futures contract staged a strong comeback
after losing Dollars 118 at one stage, to close just Dollars 23 lower at
Dollars 3,485 a tonne. This compares with its nearly nine-year high of
Dollars 4,140 on September 22.
New York arabica futures continued the trend, moving sharply lower in early
trading, but then striding back in the afternoon, with the March position up
14.50 cents at 207.25 cents a pound on a wave of buying.
The volatility appeared to reflect uncertainty over whether the rain during
the weekend, and forecasts of more to come during the early part of this
week, would do anything to relieve the pressure on next year's Brazilian
crop. This is expected to be well down following the drought and the two
severe frosts that hit the country in June and July. A report yesterday by
Weather Services, an independent US forecaster, said the recent drought was
worse than the last severe dry spell of 1985.
There was also speculation that an export sugar tax announced by Brazil on
Friday might be followed by a similar tax on coffee. GNI, the London broker,
commented in its daily report: 'Coffee prices are still historically very
high, and the government could well impose a stiff export tax in the very
near future.'
However, Mr Robert MacArthur, head of the Tropical Trader Group at Merrill
Lynch in London, said the price volatility had more to do with traders' own
positions than with any shift in fundamentals.
Indonesia, the world's third largest coffee producer, said it would increase
coffee output to 450,000 tonnes next year and predicted exports at around
300,000 tonnes, Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The prolonged drought this year had affected production for next year.
Production would be 420,000 tonnes this year, down from 460,000 tonnes last
year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh talks on international
rubber pact set for February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A third attempt to negotiate a new international rubber pact will be made in
February after consuming and producing countries failed to agree on the
crucial issue of the reference price during two weeks of talks in Geneva.
The 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement, which expires on December
31, will be extended for a further year when the pact's governing council
next meets in Kuala Lumpur at the end of November.
Producing countries had argued for a 5 per cent rise in the reference price
which has remained virtually unchanged at 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
kilo since 1979. However, consumer nations, led by the European Union,
refused to budge.
The rubber agreement is the only remaining international commodity pact with
price stabilisation provisions under which buffer stock operations are used
to keep the market price of rubber within a fixed range centred on the
reference price.
Mr Peter Lai, chairman of the United Nations-sponsored negotiations, said
after the talks ended on Friday that there was 'much sympathy' for an
increase in the level of the lower indicative price - the price below which
the buffer stock manager may, but is not obliged to, buy in stocks to
prevent further falls.
There was also 'the same measure of sympathy' for a more frequent review of
the price range than the present 15 months. Another area of disagreement,
the duration of the new accord, was unlikely to pose much difficulty, Mr Lai
added. The options are a 3-year or 5-year accord with the possibility in
each case of a 2-year extension.
Thirty-one countries took part in the Geneva talks, including the most
important exporters and importers. The next round will be held in Geneva
from February 6.
The argument over the reference price arises from different views of market
prospects. Producers say price levels set by the 1987 accord do not
guarantee farmers' livelihoods and are leading to production cuts at a time
of rising demand. Prices this summer reached their highest levels for more
than six years.
Consumers believe market conditions do not justify a rise in the reference
price of rubber, maintaining that recent price rallies have been driven by
short-term factors and by speculators.
One possible compromise is a rise in the indicative price, which is related
to production costs and is therefore an important signal to growers, while
leaving the reference price unchanged.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Bonds: World Bank follows EIB with three-year
lira offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank made its debut in the three-year area of the eurolira sector
yesterday with a L300bn offering that was targeted mainly at Italian retail
investors.
Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar sector witnessed further issuance, continuing
a trend begun last week. Borrowers also launched offerings into a rising
D-Mark sector, boosted by the German general election result.
The success of last month's three-year L500bn deal from the European
Investment Bank persuaded the World Bank to tap the short end of the lira
sector, joint lead manager IMI said.
The World Bank usually prefers to borrow funds of a maturity of at least
five years, an IMI official said.
'This deal recognises that current demand is at the very short maturities in
most currency sectors,' the official said. 'There is a particular shortage
of supranational paper.'
The bonds, launched with a coupon of 10 5/8 per cent, represent the World
Bank's first lira offering since a reverse floating-rate note launched in
May, IMI said.
France Telecom made its debut in the Canadian dollar sector with a CDollars
125m offering of three-year bonds priced to yield 12 basis points over
Canadian government bonds.
Lead manager Paribas said the bonds were targeted mainly at retail investors
in Switzerland and the Benelux countries.
Syndicate managers said the bonds were fairly priced. However, some dealers
said that the Canadian dollar sector was now becoming congested. The launch
follows similar deals last week by the European Investment Bank and
Rabobank.
'The EIB deal was a success, largely because there had been very little
issuance in Canadian dollars for some time,' said one syndicate manager.
'Then there was Rabobank, and now this deal may just have overdone things.'
Also in the Canadian dollar sector, Banque Nationale de Paris launched a
CDollars 75m offering of six-year bonds, lead managed by Hambros Bank.
Syndicate managers said that the bonds, priced to yield 22 basis points over
Canadian government bonds, represented very tight pricing for the six-year
area of the yield curve.
In the D-Mark sector, the state of Baden-Wurttemberg launched a DM750m
offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 25 basis points over German
government bonds.
Although there was some interest in the paper from German institutions, most
of the bonds were placed with institutions in the Netherlands, the UK,
France and east Asia, excluding Japan, joint lead manager Goldman Sachs
said.
It said many investors were switching out of German government bonds to buy
the new issue.
'With state bond issuance falling following privatisation (of state
companies), there is clearly room for an alternative to government bonds,
and the states are prime candidates with their high implied credit rating
and regular funding needs,' said a syndicate official.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries recover early losses as dollar
improves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
After falling back during the morning session on overnight weakening of the
dollar, Treasury prices recouped most of their losses yesterday afternoon
following a modest rebound in the US currency.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down just 1/32 at
96 5/32 , to yield 7.828 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged, at 99
7/8 , yielding 6.549 per cent.
Prices edged lower from the start, primarily because of a slide in the
dollar's value on foreign exchange markets overnight and fresh losses in US
trading, which pushed the US currency to a new low against the D-Mark.
Investors were worried that further declines in the dollar might push the
Federal Reserve into raising interest rates sooner rather than later.
Although the Fed generally does not change monetary policy because of
currency concerns, it is believed to be ready to raise rates if the economy
continues to grow strongly. Consequently, some analysts believe fresh
weakness in the dollar could trigger an early move by Fed policy makers.
The market was put under additional pressure by a firming in commodity
prices - including gold, platinum, silver and crude oil - and by news of a
strong business inventories reading for August. However, dealers reported
little selling during the morning session. This helped explain why, after
the dollar bounced of its lows, bond prices rallied in the afternoon amid a
rush of short covering by dealers.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's narrow election victory gave bunds a boost
which rippled across European government bond markets.
The Nordic markets derived additional support from the Finnish referendum on
European Union membership, which resulted in a vote of 57 per cent in favour
of joining.
German government bonds recouped an early drop to end a busy day more than
1/2 point higher.
Although bunds had already risen sharply last week in anticipation of a Kohl
victory, the rally continued yesterday as capital flows into the market
increased, observers said.
'Although a lot of people were calling for a Kohl victory, few of them were
willing to bet their money on it before the election - the opinion polls
were so close until the very end,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist
at Kleinwort Benson.
'But once people knew the outcome, there was an immediate flow of funds into
German assets, especially bonds.' Traders reported buying of bunds not only
by European fund managers, but also from east Asian and US investors. This
was also reflected in the D-Mark, which rose sharply against most other
currencies.
Bunds largely ignored weakness in the US Treasury market, which caused the
yield spread between the two markets to widen. Mr Callow expects this
divergence to continue in the near term as bunds strengthen further.
However, he warned that as bund yields approached 7 per cent, that spread
would look 'very stretched'.
The election hurdle having been overcome, the focus is now back on the
Bundesbank as market participants await September M3 money supply data and
October inflation numbers.
French bonds underperformed their German counterparts, causing the 10-year
yield spread over bunds to widen to 69 basis points, from 62 on Friday.
The market was depressed by the French franc's weakness against the D-Mark
and the shift of the political focus from Germany to France ahead of next
year's presidential elections. Political jitters have been exacerbated by
recent corruption scandals surrounding members of the government. The OAT
futures contract on Matif rose by 0.08 point to 111.90.
UK gilts tracked bunds higher and underperformed them only slightly, with
the 10-year yield spread widening by two basis points to 132. The December
long gilt future rose by  1/2 to 102 1/4 . In the absence of significant
domestic data, gilts are expected to take their cues from international
markets until Friday's release of third-quarter GDP figures.
The Nordic markets posted solid gains, boosted both by firmer markets
elsewhere and Finland's vote in favour of EU membership.
Mr Paul Donovan, bond analyst at UBS, said: 'The prospect of a positive vote
in the Swedish referendum on November 13 has increased; if Sweden agrees to
EU membership, there are realistic prospects for a 'yes' in Norway's
referendum on November 28.'
EU membership for Sweden would provide prospects for fiscal austerity as the
government aimed to meet the Maastricht criteria, and support for the krona,
he said.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Indosat ADSs set for launch
in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading is set to begin today in New York in the American Depositary Shares
(ADSs) issued by Indosat, Indonesia's international telecommunications
company, marking the launch of one of Asia's biggest international equity
issues.
The Indonesian government - which will reduce its stake by some 25 per cent
 -has raised Dollars 721.13m through an issue of 22.5m ADSs and has an
option to sell a further 3.4m. It is expected to raise a further Dollars
330m through an issue of new shares to local investors.
Overall, the scale of the deal looks likely to surpass other large Asian
issues such as Pakistan Telecommunications (Dollars 917.4m) and Morgan
Stanley Asia Pacific (Dollars 802.5m), according to figures produced by IFR
Securities in London.
The ADSs (each representing 10 shares) were priced yesterday at Dollars
32.05 each. Roughly half have been directed to US investors. The new Indosat
shares will be listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya bourses later this week.
Merrill Lynch and the local brokerage house Danareksa Securities are joint
global co-ordinators of the issue. Co-managers of the deal in the US are JP
Morgan, Salomon Brothers, Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
Smith Barney.
Reportedly oversubscribed in both New York and Jakarta, it should raise the
international image of the local market and boost the government's stalled
plans to privatise a batch of state companies. The possible privatisation of
more than 200 state firms, many of them poorly-managed and inefficient, has
been mooted for some time. Garuda Indonesia, the airline, PT Telkom, the
domestic telecommunications firm, and PLN, an electricity company, are the
favourites to follow Indosat.
The issue also confirms a trend for companies in emerging markets to raise
capital through issues of either ADSs, American Depositary Receipts or
Global Depositary Receipts, tradeable certificates which represent
underlying shares. Earlier this month, a Citibank study showed that issuers
from the emerging markets accounted for 61 per cent of ADR programmes
launched in the first nine months of the year, compared with only 11 per
cent in all of 1990.
The total number of ADR shares traded on the US stock exchanges hit an
all-time high of 5.2bn in the period, a 21 per cent increase on the year.
The dollar volume of ADRs traded amounted to Dollars 184bn, a rise of 32 per
cent.
A total of 184 companies from 40 countries launched new ADR or GDR
programmes, up from 96 companies in the comparable months of 1993.
Depositary receipts were also used in 17 privatisations.
Indian companies were the most active in the ADR market, with 29 issuing new
depository receipt programmes in the period, followed by Hong Kong with 17
companies, Brazil and Mexico with 16, and South Africa with 10.
India's Shiram Industrial Enterprises raised Dollars 40m through an issue of
GDRs on Friday. Also last week, Banco Ganadero, one of Colombia's largest
commercial banks, confirmed that it, too, intended to issue ADRs in New
York.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Transition hits third quarter at
Unisys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter earnings at Unisys dropped sharply as the US computer group
continued a painful transition from proprietary mainframe computers to
information services.
Net income for the third quarter was Dollars 42.9m, or 8 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 84.1m, or 29 cents, in the same period last year.
Excluding a one-time favourable tax item of 9 cents a year ago, earnings
were 20 cents a share.
The lower earnings were in line with Wall Street expectations.
Revenues continued to decline, but more slowly than in recent quarters.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.79bn, down from Dollars 1.81bn.
The company cited three factors that had a negative effect on third-quarter
performance: declining government business, a continuing shift away from
high-margin proprietary systems and an increase in sales expenses.
However, Unisys reported strong growth in its information services business,
which is the primary focus of its efforts to return to profitable growth.
'Revenue from information services, our strongest business, grew 23 per cent
in the quarter and 22 per cent over the past nine months,' said Mr James
Unruh, chairman and chief executive.
'We are continuing to invest in this growth business which is leading our
information management thrust. Information services is now our single
largest business revenue stream with 25 per cent of total revenue,' he said.
Mr Unruh said that the transformation was on course, in spite of declining
earnings.
Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses.
Revenues, however, have continued to decline.
For the year to date net income was Dollars 152.8m, or 36 cents a share. The
nine-month period included a charge of Dollars 7.7m, or 4 cents, for costs
associated with repurchase of debt. In the same period last year net income
was Dollars 447.7m, or Dollars 1.83, including a net gain from accounting
changes and an extraordinary item of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents. Revenue
for the first nine months of 1994 was Dollars 5.28bn, compared with Dollars
5.64bn last time.

Scott Paper, the international tissue paper manufacturer that has undergone
a restructuring, yesterday reported a near 75 per cent jump in third-quarter
net income to Dollars 60.6m, or 80 cents a share, writes Laurie Morse in
Chicago. This compares with Dollars 35.1m, or 48 cents, in the comparable
quarter last year.
Scott last week announced the sale of its S. D. Warren printing paper
subsidiary to the South African company Sappi, as part of its strategy to
focus on tissue-based products.
The profits advance was made in spite of flat sales, at Dollars 1.1bn.

<TEXT>
Falconbridge, the Canadian metals producer which went public this year, has
reported third-quarter earnings of CDollars 55.5m (USDollars 41.4m), or 32
cents a share, compared with a CDollars 11.4m loss, or 11 cents, a year
earlier, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Operating income more than quadrupled to CDollars 94.6m from CDollars 21.5m,
while revenues climbed to CDollars 526.7m from CDollars 371.1m.
The improvement was due to rising metal prices, higher sales volumes and a
drop in the Canadian dollar. The results were also buoyed by a reduction in
debt-service expenses from CDollars 21.1m to CDollars 10.9m in the wake of
the recent equity issue.

San Miguel, the Philippines' largest food and beverage conglomerate, posted
a sharply-improved net profit, of 9.6bn pesos (Dollars 375.7m), in the first
nine months of the year. It attributed the rise to an extraordinary gain
from a Hong Kong property sale, Reuter reports from Manila. Even without the
6.46bn pesos gain, San Miguel would have posted a net profit of 3.14bn pesos
in the January to September period, 40 per cent up on the 2.24bn in the same
period last year.
San Miguel, through its San Miguel Brewery Hong Kong unit, sold a prime
property in the colony for HKDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 452.9m).
The company's consolidated sales in the first nine months amounted to 48.9bn
pesos, 12 per cent better than the same period last year.

International Business Machines has simplified its personal computer product
lines, reducing them from nine ranges to four in an attempt to cut costs and
reduce confusion among buyers, writes Louise Kehoe.
The new 'branding strategy' is the latest move by IBM to try to regain
momentum in the fiercely competitive PC market. It has fallen from first
place in the US market in 1993 to fourth place behind Compaq Computer, Apple
and Packard Bell in the first half of this year.
The company also launched several new desktop and notebook models and cut
prices on others.
The new IBM brand names are IBM PC, IBM PC Server, ThinkPad (for notebook
computers) and Aptiva (for consumer products).

<TEXT>
Sun Microsystems, the computer workstation manufacturer, more than doubled
first-quarter net earnings while the per-share earnings figure tripled,
writes Louise Kehoe.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 1.27bn, up almost 33 per cent from
last year's corresponding Dollars 960.5m. Net income surged to Dollars 38.4m
from Dollars 16.6m in last year's first quarter.
Earnings per share were 40 cents, up 150 per cent from 16 cents and well
above Wall Street projections of about 26 cents.
'We had an outstanding quarter - both in the marketplace and financially,'
said Mr Michael E. Lehman, chief financial officer. 'We experienced strong
worldwide demand across all our major products and businesses in what is
normally a seasonally weak quarter. First-quarter unit shipments jumped
nearly 50 per cent over the year-ago levels, to 74,000 systems in the
quarter.'
Sun leads the market for computer workstations - powerful desktop computers
used by engineers, financial analysts and a broad range of design and
graphics professionals.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Contenders fight it out for
Czech prize - Part-sale of SPT Telecom may be biggest foreign investment to
date
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twelve of the world's leading telecommunications groups are fighting for a
27 per cent stake in SPT Telecom, the Czech Republic's telephone operator,
in what could become the country's biggest one-off foreign investment
opportunity to date.
Competition for the stake - valued at between Dollars 700m and Dollars 1bn -
is likely to be fierce. If the price reaches the higher end of expectations
it will outstrip Volkswagen's DM1.4bn (Dollars 900m), five-year purchase of
70 per cent of Skoda Automobile as the largest foreign investment yet in the
country.
'This is the big one, the one everybody has been waiting for,' says a
merchant banker advising one of the bidding companies.
The 12 companies must make preliminary bids by mid-December. Those that most
fully meet the government's two main criteria - price and operational
experience - will go through to a second round, with final offers due to be
tabled next February. The winner will be known by March 1.
The bidders are American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Ameritech International,
Bell Atlantic, Southwestern Bell International Development, GTE Telephone,
Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom, Telecom Denmark, PTT Telecom Netherlands,
Stet International, Swiss Telecom and Korea Telecom.
Analysts say the successful bid is likely to come from a consortium
consisting of a private US operator and a wholly or partly state-owned
European group. The selection of the 12 companies on October 6 has led to a
hectic round of negotiations as they attempt to join forces to bid for the
stake.
A precedent for the sale is last December's sale for Dollars 875m of a 30
per cent stake in Matav, the Hungarian equivalent of SPT, to a consortium of
Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech. The Matav sale is the biggest
telecommunications investment in central Europe to date.
In that sale, the proceeds were split between the company and the exchequer.
But SPT will receive the entire proceeds, to help it finance a Kcs130bn
(Dollars 4.7bn) modernisation programme through to the end of the decade.
The programme aims to increase the number of lines from 20 to 35 per 100
people by 1998. The present density is one of the lowest in Europe, although
higher than Hungary and Poland. The average in western Europe is roughly one
line for every two people. 'Demand and supply should balance by 1998,' says
Mr Jiri Makovec, SPT general director.
Key elements of modernisation will be to replace outdated analog equipment
with digital technology and the construction of 168 digital host exchanges
by 1998.
The Czech government has laid down strict rules for bids from consortiums.
It insists that a bidder be 'a clearly defined entity' with a transparent
ownership structure consisting of 'experienced operators'. It must also
speak with one voice. 'I will only deal with one person or one company at a
time,' warns Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech economy minister whose department is
co-ordinating the tender.
Already, speculation in Prague suggests that three of the 12 companies -
France Telecom, Bell Atlantic and PTT Telecom - are emerging as favourites
for the SPT investment. France Telecom has been providing technical
assistance to the Czech company for several years, while Bell Atlantic is a
partner, along with US West and SPT, in the EuroTel consortium established
in 1990 to provide mobile telephone services in the Czech Republic.
PTT Telecom, the Dutch operator which was partly privatised earlier this
year, has a consultancy and technology joint venture with SPT, and has
experience in Hungary, Ukraine and south-east Asia. As a relatively small
European operator, PTT 'is not a threat' to SPT, analysts say.
Attention is now focused on a detailed examination of SPT. Each company paid
Dollars 100,000 for access to preliminary bidding packages. In spite of its
underdeveloped network, SPT is highly profitable. Last year it made Kcs6bn
(Dollars 216m) on revenues of Kcs18bn. In the first six months of 1994 it
recorded pre-tax profits of Kcs3.4bn on revenues of Kcs10bn.
SPT has received Kcs7bn in loans from the World Bank, the European
Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to
finance its modernisation project. In July it raised a further Kcs1bn
through a five-year bond issue. But the bulk of the cost of modernisation
will be met through the sale of the stake and re-investment of future
profits.
SPT is 74 per cent state-owned, of which 70 per cent is held directly and 4
per cent is owned by two state-run investment funds. The remaining 26 per
cent - roughly 6m shares - is held by domestic investors who bought the
shares in the second wave of mass privatisation this year.
The winner of the tender will receive new shares in SPT, to give it a
maximum 27 per cent stake. The issue of new shares will dilute the domestic
investors' holding to 19 per cent and the state's directly-held share to 51
per cent. The state will retain its majority stake for up to five years. It
may then sell a further block of shares after that time.
The 6m shares sold in the privatisation wave have still to be delivered to
investors, but a grey market has developed in SPT stock on the Prague
bourse. The shares are trading at about Kcs3,500, which values SPT at
Dollars 2.96bn.
Bidders are somewhat in the dark, however, as to SPT's true worth. This will
not become clear until the government establishes a regulatory framework
covering future tariff policy for SPT. The framework is due to be announced
late next month, and it will have an bearing on the price the government
gets for the stake.
At present, high international tariffs subsidise SPT's domestic call
service. International call prices from the Czech Republic are among the
highest in Europe.
A call from Prague costs Kcs31.5 a minute to the UK; Kcs63 a minute to the
US; and Kcs25.2 a minute to Germany. A local call costs about Kcs2.
The tariff policy is expected to rebalance prices by lowering international
tariffs, raising local charges to market level, and pegging future price
rises to inflation. If it cuts international charges too much it would make
SPT less attractive. 'The government can influence the price it gets by
keeping international call prices high,' one banker says.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher nickel prices help to
lift Falconbridge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Falconbridge, the Canadian metals producer which went public this year, has
reported a sharp improvement in third-quarter performance, due to rising
metal prices, higher sales volumes and a drop in the Canadian dollar.
Earnings were CDollars 55.5m (USDollars 41.4m), or 32 cents a share,
compared with a CDollars 11.4m loss, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Operating
income more than quadrupled to CDollars 94.6m from CDollars 21.5m, while
revenues climbed to CDollars 526.7m from CDollars 371.1m.
The results were also buoyed by a reduction in debt-service expenses from
CDollars 21.1m to CDollars 10.9m in the wake of the recent equity issue.
Mr Frank Pickard, chief executive, predicted that nickel prices would be
supported for the rest of the year by a 10 per cent rise in western steel
output in 1994, and a 9 per cent increase in nickel consumption.
'Fourth-quarter fundamentals are the strongest the nickel industry has
experienced in many years,' he said.
Nickel output rose to 17,321 tonnes in the third quarter from 15,633 a year
earlier. Ferro-nickel production was 9,068 tonnes, up from 7,021 tonnes.
Average nickel prices received rose to USDollars 2.89 a lb from Dollars
2.29. Ferro-nickel prices climbed to Dollars 2.80 from Dollars 2.37, while
copper prices advanced to Dollars 1.13 from 86 cents.
Falconbridge also disclosed yesterday it had obtained 'particularly
encouraging' exploration results from the Kidd Creek zinc and copper mine in
northern Ontario. Samples from four new drill-holes have yielded an average
grade of 3 per cent copper, 4.8 per cent zinc, 0.85 per cent lead and 180
grams of silver per tonne.
Drilling results from the Biankouma nickel venture in the Ivory Coast
indicate the ore may be suitable for ferro-nickel production, using the same
process as Falconbridge's operation in the Dominican Republic.

profits decline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
An improved political climate and renewed economic growth allowed Holdains,
the South African packaging group, to lift an earlier, gloomy earnings
forecast, but it still recorded a 4.6 per cent decline in after-tax profit
to R110.6m (Dollars 30.1m) for the year ended in August, down from R134.8m a
year ago, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Sales rose 9 per cent, to R2.8bn from R2.5bn, but operating income declined
sharply to R168.7m from R196m as a result of intense pressure on the group's
margins in the first half of the year.
However, after-tax figures were helped by a reduction in interest paid, to
R19.8m from R31.8m, as well as lower taxes, at R25.7m compared with R29.4m a
year ago. The full-year dividend was maintained at 125 cents.
Mr Richard Bruyns, chief executive, said the outlook for the next year was
greatly improved. 'Strong turnover growth in all our divisions was achieved
in the last quarter and we anticipate that the accelerated pace will
continue,' he said.
Holdains' balance sheet improved slightly on the year as gearing dropped to
14.8 per cent from 18.4 per cent a year ago. The 1992 figure was 45.1 per
cent. The company also announced it had spent R105m on plant expansion and
R34m on asset replacement.

BES was one of the first state-owned companies to be privatised.
As one of two government-owned contractors, BES was until 1992 granted
preferential access to infrastructure contracts.
Faced with challenges from legislators and private construction companies,
it has since been obliged to participate in open bidding for projects.
The company is estimated to have orders amounting to some TDollars 20bn

<TEXT>
Berjaya, the Malaysian conglomerate controlled by Malaysian-Chinese
businessman Mr Vincent Tan, has announced a wide-ranging shake-up of its
corporate structure, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The complex exercise will bring the listed Berjaya Singer, a producer of
household goods and one of the most profitable companies in the Berjaya
stable, under the direct control of Berjaya Group, the quoted company which
serves as the conglomerate's holding company and flagship.
Under the present structure, Berjaya Singer is controlled through two other
listed companies in the group, Berjaya Industrial and Berjaya Leisure.
Berjaya Group says the new arrangement will mean that Berjaya Singer's
profits to the group holding company will no longer be diluted.
Berjaya, with interests including textiles, media, leisure and casino
operations and timber concerns, has been restructured several times in
recent years.
The latest reorganisation involves cash and share transactions between the
various Berjaya companies, plus a Berjaya Group rights issue which aims to
raise nearly MDollars 970m (USDollars 379m). The cash would be used to repay
loans and finance Berjaya's ambitious expansion plans.
Earlier this month, Berjaya companies announced plans to gain control of
Indah Water, a consortium which has been given charge of a MDollars 6.4bn
scheme to upgrade Malaysia's sewerage system.

for Dollars 365m

<TEXT>
Pacific Telecom, an 87 per cent owned unit of PacifiCorp, is selling its
Alascom long distance phone company to AT&amp;T for Dollars 365m, Reuter
reports.
Alascom provides Alaska with interstate and intrastate long-distance,
private line and other communications services.
Pacific Telecom is to use the proceeds to fund its local telephone exchange
acquisition programme, including purchases of lines from US West in Colorado
and Oregon for Dollars 380m.
In 1993 Alascom contributed Dollars 338m in operating revenue and Dollars
59m in operating income to Pacific Telecom's consolidated operations. For
the first half of 1994 the figures were Dollars 160m and Dollars 31m
respectively.
'The decision to sell Alascom was based in part on the expectation that
operating revenues and operating income would decline as the result of
implementing a final Federal Communications Commission order relating to the
restructuring of the Alaska long distance market,' said Mr Fred Buckman,
chief executive of PacifiCorp.

buy-out

Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran chairman of MCA, the Los Angeles-based
entertainment group, and Mr Sidney Sheinberg, its president, are expected at
a meeting today to raise the subject of taking control of MCA by buying a
majority stake from Matsushita, its Japanese parent.
Top managers from MCA are due to meet in Hawaii with representatives of
Matsushita, the Japanese electronics company that acquired MCA four years
ago.
Matushita yesterday denied it would consider ceding control of MCA, which
owns Geffen Records and Columbia Pictures, the studio behind a string of
recent recent box office hits, including The Flintstones and Jurassic Park.
Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, said his group had not
received notification of a bid for MCA. However, he admitted to a Japanese
newspaper that there had been differences between MCA and Matsushita over
the former's investment plans.
The MCA management has made no secret of its frustration with Matsushita's
apparent reluctance to allow the company to participate in the acquisitions
and joint ventures sweeping across the entertainment industry.
Since buying MCA for Dollars 6.1bn in 1990, Matsushita is reported to have
blocked several proposed investments, including a plan to buy a stake in the
NBC television network and an earlier bid to take control of Virgin Records.
Faced with the aggressive expansion of rivals, such as Time Warner and
Viacom, Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg are said to have become anxious to
free MCA from Matsushita's control. The two, both of whom made substantial
sums from the Matsushita acquisition, are believed to have discussed the
possibility of a buy-back with external investors.
They are also understood to have had discussions with the three Hollywood
heavyweights - Mr David Geffen, the music magnate, Mr Steven Spielberg, the
Oscar-winning film director, and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt
Disney's movie studios - who last week announced plans to launch a new
entertainment group.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Apple Computer enjoys a record
fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer has turned in record fourth-quarter revenues, boosted by
strong sales of multimedia personal computers and its new Power Macintosh
models. Earnings picked up significantly as costs declined.
Revenues totalled Dollars 2.4bn, a 16 per cent increase over last year's
fourth quarter, and the highest quarterly figure in Apple's history. Net
income for the three months was Dollars 114.7m, or 95 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.
Apple said quarterly unit shipments exceeded 1m computers for only the
second time in its history. Mr Michael Spindler, president and chief
executive officer, attributed the increase to strong demand for multimedia
versions of its Macintosh computers, notebook computers and its new Power
Macintosh desktop computers. Strong demand has led to a shortage of some of
these products, Apple said.
During the quarter Apple shipped more than 250,000 Power Macintosh personal
computers and upgrades, bringing the total to more than 600,000 units since
the products were introduced in March. The company has set a goal of
shipping 1m Power Macintosh personal computers and upgrades in the first 12
months.
Apple said its earnings improvement was the result of strong revenue growth
combined with higher gross margins and lower operating expenses. Gross
margins improved to 27.2 per cent of net sales, compared with 25.7 per cent
in the fourth quarter of 1993. Operating expenses declined to 19.6 per cent
of sales, from 25.4 per cent, and represented one of the lowest operating
expense ratios in Apple's history.
For the full year, revenues were Dollars 9.19bn, a 15 per cent increase over
fiscal 1993. Net income was Dollars 310.2m or Dollars 2.61 against Dollars
86.6m or 73 cents.
Included in the company's results for fiscal 1993 was a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 320.9m for restructuring and other expenses. Fiscal 1994 results
include a pre-tax gain of Dollars 126.9m related to a reduction in the
company's estimates of restructuring costs.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: US banks register sharp profits
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A pick-up in consumer lending in the US this year was the main factor behind
underlying double-digit earnings growth at three large US commercial banks
which reported third-quarter earnings yesterday.
NationsBank, the third biggest bank with assets of Dollars 167bn, said its
consumer loans were up 18 per cent on a year ago, while commercial loans
were 10 per cent higher, excluding the effect of acquisitions.
KeyCorp, the Cleveland-based group with assets of Dollars 65bn, reported
loans up 13 per cent on a year before.
First Interstate, a Los Angeles-based bank, reported loan growth of 22 per
cent. The advance was based on acquisitions, as well as the continuing
recovery in the Californian economy. The growth in loans came against the
background of narrower lending margins at the first two banks.
At NationsBank, the net interest margin slipped from 3.83 to 3.54 per cent,
and at KeyCorp from 5.3 to 4.69 per cent. First Interstate, though, reported
an improvement in its margin, to 5.22 per cent.
NationsBank reported after-tax profits of Dollars 431m, up 26 per cent due
partly to acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 17 per cent, to Dollars
1.55, in line with market expectations.
KeyCorp's net income also matched most analysts' projections, with a 14 per
cent year-on-year rise, to Dollars 229m. Earnings per share rose 12 per
cent, to 92 cents.
First Interstate, despite the advance in underlying earnings, was held back
by a previously announced restructuring charge of Dollars 86.2m, or Dollars
1.05, after tax. Net income was Dollars 130m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, down
from Dollars 150m, or Dollars 1.80 a share.
However, First Chicago, with assets of Dollars 66bn at end-September,
reported a 46 per cent fall in net income from a record level in the third
quarter of 1993. Earnings last year had benefited from the sale of equity
investments, which contributed Dollars 1.40 a share. Net income was Dollars
154m, or Dollars 1.54 a share.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: New York puts new light on
nationalisation - Richard Tomkins examines the arguments for the state's
planned Dollars 2.5bn takeover of Lilco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
America, the land of free enterprise, is surely the last place anyone would
expect to find the public sector proposing to nationalise a stock-market
quoted company.
That, however, is precisely what the State of New York intends to do with
its planned Dollars 2.5bn acquisition of the Long Island Lighting Company, a
private sector electricity company known to its customers as Lilco.
Thumbing its nose at the world-wide trend towards privatisation, New York
state has asked the company to enter immediate negotiations on its proposed
cash offer of Dollars 21.50 a share.
Lilco's board says it is 'seriously evaluating' the offer: but it seems
quite possible the company and its shareholders will accept.
Why do it? Lilco, which generates and distributes power in the counties of
Nassau, Suffolk and a portion of Queens, is not in imminent danger of
collapse. But it is extremely unpopular with its customers because it
charges the highest electricity prices in the US - 16.1 cents per kWh for
residential customers, almost double the national average of 8.7 cents.
Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says that taking
Lilco into public ownership would cut electricity bills by an immediate 10
per cent because the company would no longer have to pay tax or
shareholders' dividends.
The result would be a lot of happy voters when Mr Cuomo is fighting a tough
re-election battle.
Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at Bear Stearns, the Wall Street
securities house, believes the financial case stacks up. The arithmetic goes
like this.
At present, US electricity companies need to deliver an annual rate of
return of 11 per cent on equity to attract investors. For Lilco, the cost in
shareholder dividends works at about Dollars 250m after tax. That means it
has to earn Dollars 400m before tax to deliver a satisfactory rate of
remuneration.
Now contrast the case if the company were taken into public ownership. The
takeover would be financed through a Dollars 2.5bn issue of tax-exempt
revenue bonds. Holders of these would require an interest rate only 7 per
cent because they would not have to pay tax on the income, so the after-tax
cost of servicing the debt would be only Dollars 175m. And because a
government-owned Lilco would not be liable for taxation, the figure would be
Dollars 175m before tax, too.
The saving to Lilco would therefore be the difference between Dollars 400m
and Dollars 175m: that is, Dollars 225m. Based on Lilco's present annual
revenues of Dollars 2.35bn, that would allow for an immediate cut in
electricity prices of just under 10 per cent.
The logic is seductive. But if valid, could not the same case be made for
nationalising every other private sector utility in the US?
Mr Irwin Stelzer, director of regulatory policy studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, a free-market think-tank, points out there are flaws
in the argument. One is that a public sector company is unlikely to be
better managed than a private sector one. Another is that Lilco's tax-exempt
status will simply transfer costs from its customers to federal taxpayers. A
third is that the bond issue will further extend New York state's
indebtedness, leaving it less room to borrow for other purposes.
A better way of reducing electricity bills, according to Mr Stelzer, would
be to allow other power companies to supply cheap electricity to Lilco's
customers through Lilco's wires.
'The solution to high-cost power is competition, not state monopolies,' Mr
Stelzer says.
In fact, some of Lilco's most pressing problems relate to the threat of
competition.
Between 1973 and 1984, the company spent Dollars 5.5bn on constructing a
nuclear power station which was never used. Now it has to charge high prices
to service the debt it incurred - but it can only do so because it enjoys a
monopoly.
That could change. The regulatory environment for electricity companies is
shifting, and Lilco is under increasing pressure to let its customers shop
around for power.
Once that starts to happen, Lilco will need to charge even higher prices to
maintain revenues from a smaller customer base, leading to a spiral of
decline.
Such fears have done little for Lilco's share price: it has generally been
heading downwards for more than a year. From that point of view, a takeover
by New York state might come as a relief.
But the market yesterday looked reluctant to gamble that Mr Cuomo would be
re-elected to pursue it. Lilco's shares closed down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars
17 3/8, well below the Dollars 21.50 offer price.

Travelers, the broad-based US financial services group, was held back by
difficult conditions in the financial markets in the three months to the end
of September. The company reported a marginal advance in earnings per share
to 97 cents, up from 96 cents a year before.
Profit growth was dampened by a fall in operating earnings at Smith Barney,
the group's securities business. Smith Barney reported earnings of Dollars
72.9m, down from Dollars 118.8m, even though the year-ago period included
only a two-month contribution from Shearson, the retail broker Travelers
bought from American Express.
Earnings from consumer finance rose 10 per cent to Dollars 56m, while
operating profits from life assurance were 13 per cent higher, at Dollars
50m.
Overall, Travelers reported net income for the period of Dollars 331m,
compared with Dollars 242m the year before. In the 1993 period, the group,
then known had Primerica, had yet to buy out the whole of the Travelers
insurance company.

Scott Paper, the international tissue paper manufacturer that has been
undergoing a big restructuring, yesterday reported a near 75 per cent jump
in third-quarter net income to Dollars 60.6m, or 80 cents a share. This
compares with Dollars 35.1m, or 48 cents, in the comparable quarter last
year.
Scott last week announced the sale of its SD Warren printing paper
subsidiary to the South African company Sappi. The deal was part of its
strategy to focus on tissue-based consumer products,
The profits advance was made in spite of flat sales, at Dollars 1.1bn.
Mr Albert Dunlap, the new chairman brought in to oversee Scott's
restructuring, said: 'Our third-quarter results represent the best quarterly
performance in four years.'
During the third quarter, SD Warren's sales increased modestly to Dollars
294.7m, from last year's Dollars 290.8m, while its operating income rose to
Dollars 26.3m, from Dollars 26m.
For the first nine months, Scott recorded income of Dollars 126.0m, or
Dollars 1.68, against last year's Dollars 93.3m, or Dollars 1.26.

product lines

<TEXT>
International Business Machines has simplified its personal computer product
lines, reducing them from nine ranges to four in an attempt to cut costs and
reduce confusion among buyers.
The new 'branding strategy' is the latest move by IBM to try to regain
momentum in the fiercely competitive PC market. It has fallen from first
place in the US PC market in 1993 to fourth place behind Compaq Computer,
Apple and Packard Bell in the first half of this year.
The company also launched several new desktop and notebook models and cut
prices on others.
'The PC industry has done a brilliant job of innovation and technology,'
said Mr G. Richard Thoman, IBM senior vice-president and group executive,
who took charge of IBM's PC operations in January.
'But in the process, we have lost touch with the majority of customers who
are all dazed and confused by the complexity in the technology, the array of
choices, and the level of support.'
The new IBM brand names are IBM PC, IBM PC Server, ThinkPad (for notebook
computers) and Aptiva (for consumer products).
The consolidation does away with lines including the PS/1, PS/2 and Value
Point, and reduces the number of designs IBM will manufacture. The new
approach marks the return of the 'IBM PC' brand that for a decade was the
hallmark of PC industry standards.
IBM will back its new branding strategy with an aggressive television and
print advertising campaign, Mr Thoman said. Streamlining the product lines
is part of a broad restructuring effort, he added. Over the past 10 months
he has consolidated IBM PC operations and sharply cut its workforce.
The changes have been 'difficult, but necessary', said Mr Thoman. 'We are
now in a position to respond better and faster to the customer and become
the long-term leader in the PC industry.'
The company also introduced new products under these brands, including a
family of commercial desktops - the IBM PC 700 and IBM PC 300 Series.
A software suite called IBM PC EasyTools, including applications and
programs that help to set up a new computer, will be loaded on the entire
IBM PC series.
Also introduced were a new PC Server and new multimedia notebook computers.
Prices were cut by up to 17 per cent on some existing ThinkPad and PS/2
models.

Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, reported record sales
and earnings for the third quarter, with revenues up sharply as sales of its
high-performance Pentium microprocessors, used in the latest personal
computers, doubled.
Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 2.86bn, up from Dollars 2.24bn a year
ago. Net income rose 14 per cent to Dollars 659m, or Dollars 1.52 a share,
against Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33, for the same quarter last year.
The PC industry is rapidly moving to a new performance standard, based on
Pentium microprocessors, said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief
executive. 'The PC industry is moulting, shedding its past in a way that
hasn't happened for a decade. Just one year ago, the standard was a PC
featuring an Intel 486 microprocessor. Today, a PC at the same price point
has a Pentium processor.
'This is the fastest and smoothest processor generation changeover we have
ever experienced,' said Mr Grove. Intel said it expected to meet its goal of
increasing Pentium sales to 25 per cent of its fourth-quarter microprocessor
unit sales.
A second goal was to ship 6m-7m Pentium chips this year. The company said it
expected to be within a few weeks of meeting this goal by the end of the
year.
Intel recently began an unprecedented Dollars 80m advertising campaign, to
last through the end of the year, for Pentium PCs. The company is pushing
Pentium sales in a bid to beat competitors.
Although Intel dominates the market for microprocessors used in PCs, with
about 90 per cent of the world market, several competitors are nipping at
its heels. Advanced Micro Devices is expected this week to announce a new
chip called the 'K86', which it says will be compatible with Intel's
Pentium, but faster. IBM, Nexgen and Cyrix are also offering their own
versions of Intel-compatible microprocessors.
For the nine-month period, Intel revenues were Dollars 8.29bn, up 30 per
cent from Dollars 6.39bn in the same period last year. Net income of Dollars
1.92bn represents a 13 per cent increase from Dollars 1.7bn for the first
three quarters of 1993. Earnings per share grew to Dollars 4.37 from Dollars
3.86 for the same period last year.

Sales of Roche, the Basle-based healthcare and fine chemicals group,
continued to deteriorate in the third quarter, falling 4.7 per cent to
SFr3.4bn (Dollars 2.63bn).
Roche, which is in the process of completing a Dollars 5.3bn acquisition of
the US pharmaceuticals group Syntex, also said yesterday that it would make
a SFr230m provision against this year's pre-tax profit for a restructuring
of its pharmaceuticals division. Some 5,000 jobs would be eliminated, mainly
in the US.
However, Roche said it still expected 1994 net income 'to show a further
rise' over last year's SFr2.48bn.
The rise of the Swiss franc continued to dampen revenues. Expressed in local
currencies, total sales in the nine months to September 30 were up 6 per
cent. In Swiss franc terms, they were flat at SFr10.7bn.
The group said it 'felt the impact' of health cost containment measures
taken by governments in several countries. Sales in the pharmaceuticals
division, which turned downward in the second quarter, fell 4.3 per cent in
the third quarter to SFr1.85bn.
However, it said pharmaceuticals sales in local currencies grew
significantly faster than the average for its sector in most leading
countries, due to its strong position in the hospital market.
The vitamins and fine chemicals division achieved a volume increase in spite
of competition from low-cost suppliers from the Asia-Pacific region. Sales
were down 7 per cent in the quarter at SFr780m.
Sales of the diagnostics division fell 10.8 per cent in the third quarter to
SFr380m, reflecting closure of some unprofitable laboratories and changes in
customer payment policies. Two new applications of Roche's polymerase chain
reaction technology, for detecting the hepatitis-C virus and mycobacterium
tuberculosis, have been well received.
The flavours and fragrances division bucked the group trend, achieving a 4.7
per cent rise in third-quarter sales to SFr375m. The group cited strong
sales of flavours in the US and a general recovery of fragrance sales.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ferfin opts for simplification -
The Italian group still has many debts to clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What has been described as the largest out-of-court financial restructuring
in corporate history is almost one year old.
In October last year, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian financial
holding company, and its industrial subsidiary Montedison proposed a radical
programme of disposals, capital raising and debt-for-equity exchanges to
sceptical bankers.
The company had been brought close to collapse by alleged mismanagement, and
was groaning under a burden of debt estimated at L30,000bn (Dollars
19.35bn). Although the threatened alternative was bankruptcy for Italy's
second largest private industrial group, some foreign banks held out for
better terms until the end of November, when the plan was finally agreed.
Since then, Ferfin and Montedison, 30.5 per cent of which is owned by the
financial holding company, have moved quickly to reduce debt and make the
promised disposals. Yesterday, Mr Guido Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi, who took
over last year as, respectively, chairman and managing director of the two
companies, expressed themselves satisfied with the progress of the plan at a
shareholders' meeting called to simplify still further the sprawling
structure of the group.
But the Ferruzzi-Montedison group is still less than halfway towards the
target of L7,000bn which it wants to raise from asset sales and debt
transfers by the end of 1997. Although the group continues to work on
restructuring all its subsidiaries, many of the most difficult disposals
still have to be made.
Asset sales have raised more than L2,300bn, in cash and debt transfers, with
the disposal last week of Fermar, the group's shipbuilding subsidiary. In
the first six months of this year, Ferfin cut its borrowings by nearly 30
per cent to L15,768bn.
The sale of Fermar to fellow Italian shipbuilder Gruppo Coeclerici was the
biggest disposal so far. Coeclerici is to buy Fermar for L225bn, of which
L62.5bn plus interest will be paid in three years, and the disposal will
reduce Ferfin's debt by a further L320bn.
The group has disposed of its stakes in other quoted companies, including
Gemina, the insurance company, Mediobanca, the merchant bank which
masterminded the rescue plan, and Parmalat, the foods group. It has also
sold or closed many small trading and agro-foods subsidiaries, disposed of
substantial property interests, and even auctioned off paintings, furniture
and ornaments bought by the previous management.
Ferfin wants to slim until it controls only its 30 per cent stake in
Montedison, which is active in the energy, chemicals and agro-industrial
sectors, and its 34 per cent direct and indirect investment in Fondiaria,
the insurance company. Mr Bondi said yesterday that the disposal programme
was on schedule, and that prices were in line with internal forecasts 'down
to the last lira'. This is heartening news for a company which last year -
under previous management - had to admit that it had discovered a L435bn
hole in its 1992 accounts, triggering a series of judicial and financial
investigations which are continuing.
The test will come with the larger disposals which lie ahead. For example,
Ferfin still controls a majority stake in Calcestruzzi, the quoted concrete
and building materials group, which has been hard hit by the downturn in the
Italian construction and public works sector. Mr Giampiero Pesenti, who
heads Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, may want to increase his
own minority interest in Calcestruzzi, but such a move would raise
anti-trust problems and risk prompting a full bid for the concrete group.
Ferfin also controls holdings which reflect the interests of its discredited
founder, Mr Raul Gardini, who killed himself last year, and Mr Carlo Sama,
the former managing director.
Ferfin and Montedison undoubtedly hope that creditors - now among their
largest shareholders following the conversion of debt into equity last year
 -will not put undue pressure on the group to accelerate the programme, a
move which might sacrifice the benefits already achieved.
At least the signs are encouraging. Yesterday, Montedison shareholders heard
that the group had consolidated the last L345bn of its debt at favourable
rates, which will save the company a further L18bn of financial charges
every year, and voted in favour of absorbing Finanziaria Agroindustriale,
the quoted vehicle for shares in Eridania Beghin-Say, Montedison's
agroindustrial subsidiary.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Deficit cut to Dollars 32m at
Time Warner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Record operating earnings at Time Warner's publishing, music and
cable-television channel businesses allowed the US entertainment group to
report a net loss of Dollars 32m for the third quarter, sharply reduced from
the Dollars 133m loss incurred a year ago.
During the quarter, combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortisation (Ebitda) for the group and its Time Warner Entertainment
subsidiary (which reports operating results on a deconsolidated basis)
reached Dollars 747m on revenues of Dollars 4.1bn, compared with Ebitda of
Dollars 726m on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn a year ago.
The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden
following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, likes to focus Wall
Street's attention on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying performance.
Time Warner's music division posted the best results, with Ebitda of Dollars
172m compared with Dollars 132m a year earlier. Worldwide record sales and
music publishing revenues were both significantly higher, with Warner Music
artists such as Eric Clapton and REM releasing best-selling albums during
the period.
The group's publishing division also notched up record earnings from
continuing operations, with Ebitda rising 20 per cent to Dollars 78m.
Although the group's HBO television cable channel reported record Ebitda of
Dollars 66m, up 16 per cent from 1993, Time Warner's filmed entertainment
division saw the figure fall to Dollars 189m from Dollars 204m a year ago.
The group said the comparison over the year was unfavourable primarily
because the unit produced exceptionally strong earnings in the third quarter
of 1993.
Once again, earnings from cable operations declined, with Ebitda falling to
Dollars 242m from Dollars 268m a year ago in response to the reduction in
cable television charges imposed by Congress last year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Drug companies face lawsuits in
US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty-nine of the world's largest drug companies are likely to face US
federal lawsuits from pharmacy groups alleging price discrimination and
anti-trust violation.
The Georgia Pharmacy Association said yesterday it and other groups
representing 1,346 independent pharmacies in 15 states would file separate
federal lawsuits against 29 drug companies. Target companies include
Merck-Medco of the US and the UK's Glaxo, the world's two biggest drug
companies.
The lawsuits are the latest moves in a campaign by pharmacies against drug
makers. It includes lobbying Washington to staunch the flow of corporate and
commercial drug company deals with healthcare intermediaries called health
management organisations (HMOs) and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
Pharmacists accuse drug makers of offering better deals to the
intermediaries even if pharmacy chains are buying in greater bulk and should
qualify for greater discounts.
Pharmacists' groups have been pressing the Federal Trade Commission over the
planned Dollars 4bn purchase by US drug company Eli Lilly of PCS, a pharmacy
benefit manager.

FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Valeo in Dollars 80m US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Valeo, the French vehicle components group, yesterday took a further step in
the expansion of its North American operations, announcing that it is to buy
Lake Center Industries (LCI), a US supplier of electronic and mechanical
equipment, for Dollars 80m.
The French company said the acquisition would strengthen its position with
North American vehicle manufacturers, in particular Chrysler, General Motors
and Ford.
LCI's main product lines include control panels for heating and air
conditioning systems, switches and electronic assemblies. Its annual
revenues amount to Dollars 110m and are expected to reach Dollars 140m in
1995. The company, a subsidiary of Guy Atkinson, has six manufacturing
plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin, with a workforce of 1,380.
The US company will become a division of Valeo Electronics, and should push
sales for this sector of Valeo's operations to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 410m) in
1995.
Turnover for Valeo as a whole is expected to reach FFr22.5bn this year, with
more than FFr3bn coming from North America. Its principal products include
cooling systems, clutches, heating and air conditioning systems and
windscreen wiper equipment.
Valeo said it would pay for the acquisition in cash. Following the purchase
of Borg Instruments of Germany, and majority stakes in joint ventures in
Argentina and China, Valeo said its total financial investments for the year
should total about FFr850m.
The company added that strong cash flow should enable it to reduce its debt
to equity ratio to below 10 per cent at the end of the year, compared with
14 per cent at the end of 1993.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Survey shows 8.5% rise in directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors' pay rose by an average 8.5 per cent this year, more than six
percentage points above inflation, according to a survey published
yesterday.
Chief executives, directors and senior executives earn an average basic
salary of Pounds 109,030, increasing to Pounds 183,787 when bonuses and
other benefits are included.
In a telephone survey of the FT-SE 100 companies, more than half said their
chief executives worked under three-year contracts, which can command huge
severance payments.
Almost two thirds of those companies stated they had no intention to reduce
the length of contracts, despite a high profile campaign by leading
investment institutions.
Chief executives, whose average total pay package now stands at Pounds
351,280, have resisted institutional pressure to move away from three-year
rolling contracts.
The survey, by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, of 954 directors in 126 companies,
also revealed a widening pay gap between small and large businesses.
Directors at companies with turnover of more than Pounds 1.25bn enjoyed a 10
per cent pay rise, compared with 6 per cent for those at companies with less
than Pounds 125m turnover.
'Our survey data shows that directors' earnings differentials are widening
between the successful and the struggling companies, as performance-related
pay becomes a larger part of the remuneration mix,' said Mr Keith McNeish,
pay and benefits consultant at Bacon &amp; Woodrow.
'Furthermore, the pay gap is widening between small and large companies.
The salary gap between executives has also increased over the past 12
months, with the differential between chief executives and their senior
executives rising from 136 to 170 per cent.
The survey revealed that the UK's average director is aged 48 and male. Of
the 954 executives surveyed, just 32 are female.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe confident that Avro will break even by
1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace expects its lossmaking Avro regional jet operations to
break even by 1997; earlier if the regional aircraft market recovers more
quickly as a result of the extensive restructuring of the past three years.
Avro is expected to lose about Pounds 50m this year on sales of between
Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m.
Mr Michael Donovan, Avro's new chief executive, said yesterday that
break-even would be achieved even without a joint venture with other
regional jet manufacturers.
The company has shed 6,000 jobs in the last three years and now employs only
2,000 at its assembly facility at Woodford, near Manchester.
Mr Donovan was speaking at the hand-over of the first of three Avro RJ85
jets to Lufthansa's regional subsidiary, Cityline. The German airline is the
first large international flag carrier to order the aircraft.
'The delivery to Lufthansa represents a milestone in the history of Avro,
and indeed British Aerospace,' said Mr Donovan. Lufthansa has also taken
options to acquire an additional three RJ aircraft.
Talks are continuing between BAe and Fokker, the Dutch regional aircraft
manufacturer owned by Deutsche Aerospace, on the establishment of a regional
aircraft joint venture modelled on European Airbus, the large airliner
consortium. These discussions are likely to take time, although both
companies acknowledge that they share a vision of the need to regroup in the
European regional jet market.
BAe is also keeping its options open over possible collaboration with
Asia-Pacific manufacturers, since it believes that Asia will become the
biggest market for regional jets. BAe failed to negotiate a regional jet
joint venture with Taiwan last year, but Taiwan is understood to be still
interested.
Mr Donovan stressed that any joint venture would be customer-driven.
Although the industrial logic argued in favour of a European grouping of
regional jet manufacturers to reduce excess capacity, European manufacturers
had to be open to possible joint ventures with Asian partners - a
prerequisite for large-scale aircraft sales in that region.
This year Avro has won 18 orders for its jets (equivalent to one year's
production) and has an order backlog of 29 aircraft.
At its peak five years ago, BAe was producing about 40 regional jets from
its two assembly lines at Woodford and Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Hatfield has
since been closed.
BAe is also continuing its search for joint venture partners for its
lossmaking turbo-propeller activities regrouped around Prestwick, Scotland.
This represents a more difficult challenge as the turbo-prop business is
estimated to be losing some Pounds 150m a year.
Unlike the regional jet operations, the future of the turbo-prop side hinges
on a joint venture since the company believes it is highly unlikely that
these activities can break even on their own. BAe has been talking to the
Franco-Italian ATR consortium.
The problem for the turbo-prop business is that regional airlines are
tending to trade up their turbo-prop aircraft for jets.
Overall, BAe is confident its commercial aircraft operations - which turned
over Pounds 1.6bn last year - will be profitable by 1997, largely because of
the contribution from its 20 per cent stake in the Airbus consortium. Airbus
is already contributing profits.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Highland advances to Pounds 42.5m - Whisky
producer hints at diversifying into other spirits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highland Distilleries, the independent Scotch whisky producer, reported
yesterday a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 42.5m for
the year to August 31 and hinted that it was thinking of diversifying into
other spirits.
Despite its success from focusing on Scotch, 'we see ourselves as a premium
spirits company. If there are opportunities in other spirits, we wouldn't
say 'no',' Mr Brian Ivory, chief executive, said.
'Other spirits would give our sales and distribution another sector of the
market,' said Mr John Goodwin, chairman. Neither he nor Mr Ivory would be
drawn on which drinks Highland was looking at or whether it would buy or
build brands.
'We're working very hard on this and within the next year, we'll come out
with something,' Mr Goodwin said.
Despite difficult conditions over the past year, Highland's Famous Grouse
Scotch brand, accounting for three quarters of group operating profits of
Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.5m), held its second place in the UK market behind
Bell's, but its share slipped to 13.8 per cent (14 per cent). It increased
exports by 14 per cent in volume terms and 24 per cent by value.
Sales of new fillings and mature whiskies were steady, but profits were
lower in the latest financial year. Orders for new fillings this year were
up 11 per cent.
Income from associates rose to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 9.8m), reflecting a
larger contribution from Robertson &amp; Baxter, a distiller, and the first time
equity accounting of Highland's 50 per cent interest in the North British
grain distillery.
With Christmas threatening to bring another whisky price war, Highland
expressed confidence in its strategy of maintaining its premium market
position.
Highland planned to use the same approach as last year when it maintained
its premium pricing and refrained from joining its rivals' discounts for
buying multiple bottles.
Turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 171.1m to Pounds 175.8m. A 5.5p final
dividend is proposed, making 7.26p (6.6p) for the year. Earnings per share
were up 9 per cent at 21.9p and the company is proposing to buy back up to 5
per cent of its shares.
COMMENT
Highland has proved again the wisdom of focusing on Scotch and the Famous
Grouse brand. The strategy will face another test this Christmas when the
group will defend its premium market position against price-cutting
competitors. But the brand's inherent strength is likely to produce pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 46m this year for earnings of 23.7p and a
prospective p/e of 17.6. This is expensive relative to the market and the
suggestion of broadening the drinks portfolio might undermine the shares
until Highland's strategy is clarified. With these uncertainties, the shares
fell 14p to 419p yesterday.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Airtours stretches sea-legs in Pounds 35m
buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The detour by Airtours into the cruise market, launched in April with the
purchase of a Norwegian ship, has taken off faster than the group expected.
Yesterday the UK's second biggest holiday company paid Pounds 35m cash for a
second ship - almost six months before a single passenger embarks on an
Airtours cruise.
'We were surprised by the demand in the market place,' said Mr Hugh
Collinson, managing director, adding that potential customers had been
disappointed that more than 90 per cent of the cruises on the first ship had
already been sold.
'We were keen to get a second ship to take advantage of the pent up demand,'
he said.
The group's first boat, the Seawing, has room for 800 passengers, and sets
sail under the Airtours banner on March 25.
Its purchase for Pounds 16m was announced on April 28 at the same time as an
Pounds 82m rights issue and the acquisition of SAS Leisure for Pounds 74m.
The group said at the time that it had no immediate plans to invest in
further cruise ships.
The Nordic Prince, bought yesterday from Royal Caribbean Cruises, can take
more than 1,200 passengers. Airtours takes delivery at the beginning of next
year, but is leasing the ship back to Royal Caribbean until March 15.
Mr Collinson said the ship would then undergo a minor refit - mainly of
furnishings - and start operations for Airtours on May 6 from Palma in the
Mediterranean.
Airtours is using its existing marketing and reservation systems for its
cruise holidays, which can be combined with stays ashore.
Mr Collinson said summer prices for a flight and an inside cabin ranged from
Pounds 399 to Pounds 549 per person a week, which he claimed was Pounds 300
below competitors' prices.
April's rights issue price was 390p. Yesterday the shares edged ahead 3p to
455p.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Division's Dollars 2m step into electronic
entertainment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Division, one of a small group of public companies specialising in virtual
reality technology, has taken its first step in the entertainment business.
It will announce today a Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.45m) order from Virtual
World Entertainment of Chicago, which is pioneering a form of entertainment
centre. The VWE order marks Division's first success in an area with great
potential for virtual reality companies.
VWE specialises in electronic entertainment for 18 to 35-year-olds. Its
centres follow the theme of a battle between robots or a race beneath the
surface of Mars.
The idea is to create an electronic equivalent of the setting where social
ambience is as important as the game, as with a bowling alley, for example.
Electronics supplied by Division will improve the realism.
Its principal market to date has been the engineering sector. Its largest
customer is Matsushita Electric of Japan, for which it built a system that
simulates a kitchen complete with white goods. It recently sold a system to
McDonnell Douglas which simulates the engine and engine bay of its F/A-18
fighter aircraft.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy buoyed by lower interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp reduction in interest charges helped Kelt Energy, the oil and gas
producer and explorer, increase interim profits in spite of lower oil
prices.
Profits after tax for the six months to end-June rose from Pounds 2.54m to
Pounds 2.77m after a reduced interest charge of Pounds 523,000 (Pounds
1.05m).
Strong operating cashflow enabled the company to repay fixed interest loans
of Dollars 15.2m (Pounds 9.6m) and Dollars 6.97m and to reduce gearing to 4
per cent (9 per cent) in spite of acquisitions in Gabon and heavy investment
in its Colombian wells.
Turnover was down at Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 18.2m), with the profit
improvement being achieved in spite of oil prices on average Dollars 3 per
barrel (15 per cent) lower than in the first half of last year. The price
fall was, however, partly offset by higher production, with daily output
running 17 per cent above that achieved last year.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 1.8p.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ross tumbles to Pounds 15,000 as costs of
restructuring bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring costs of Pounds 500,000 reduced pre-tax profits at Ross Group,
the consumer products and technical services company, from a restated Pounds
602,000 to just Pounds 15,000 for the six months to June 30.
The shares closed 2p down at 8 1/2 p.
Turnover of continuing operations rose by 41 per cent, from Pounds 22.9m to
Pounds 32.3m. Operating profits fell from Pounds 1.83m to Pounds 32,000.
The technical services division suffered 'significant losses', which would
continue into the second half, said Mr Noel Hayes, chairman.
The company had recently won two contracts for test rigs, the benefits of
which would be apparent in the 1995 results.
Stiff competition and small margins, together with the costs of integrating
three businesses into one site at Bolton, depressed profits in the consumer
products division.
Better news came from the Powercords division, which makes plug-in power
supplies for mobile phones, said Mr Hayes. Tadmod was expected to increase
turnover by 75 per cent in 1994, and Ross was anticipating a further 35 per
cent increase for 1995. The group is targeting Asian markets through Accom,
its joint venture company in China.
The group also disposed of Traveller, its travel accessories company.
Losses per share came out at 0.04p, compared with earnings of 0.29p, and
there is no interim dividend (0.2p). The company will not make a decision on
a final dividend until the end of the first quarter of 1995.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hobson continues CWS rationalisation with
further sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hobson, the homecare and food products group, yesterday announced a further
series of rationalisations of the food manufacturing business of the
Co-operative Wholesale Society it bought for Pounds 111m in April.
The group will receive some Pounds 11.1m cash, but costs, including
write-offs, will amount to Pounds 7.5m.
It has sold, to HL Foods, the plant and machinery of FE Barber's cannery
operations in Lowestoft, Suffolk, for Pounds 200,000, and its contracts and
stock for Pounds 9m cash.
It has also sold - to Pura Food Products, a subsidiary of Acatos &amp;
Hutcheson, the edible oils group - the plant and machinery of its oils and
fats operation for Pounds 950,000. Pura has paid Pounds 2.08m for the
contracts and stock.
As already announced, Hobson has closed the Lowestoft cannery with the loss
of 350 jobs. Its oils and fats operation in Irlam, Greater Manchester, is
also to be closed and relocated to London with the loss of a further 120
jobs. This will take the CWS jobs lost since the acquisition to 600, or
about 40 per cent of the ex-CWS workforce.
In the year to January 8, the cannery made losses before interest and tax of
Pounds 691,000 on sales of Pounds 39.5m. Net assets at that date were Pounds
15.8m. The operation has continued to be lossmaking.
The oils and fats operations, which had assets of Pounds 2.1m at the year
end, incurred losses of Pounds 235,000 before interest and tax.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitive MY leaps to Pounds 4.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY Holdings, the packaging group, pledged to continue its acquisitions
strategy after announcing an 80 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the
year to August 27.
The company, which spent Pounds 23.3m acquiring four packaging businesses
this year, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 4.51m on
turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 51.2m (Pounds 35.1m).
Mr John Monks, chief executive, said the company was considering another
share issue to fund acquisitions this year. In February, the group raised
about Pounds 23m through a placing which more than doubled its market
capitalisation.
'This year's acquisitions are not the end of the story. We are only at the
beginning,' he said.
'We like healthcare and would like further expansion in that sector. We are
also looking to continue our expansion of specialist corrugated activities,
and would like to fill in gaps in our geographical spread. We do not really
have anything in the Midlands and the west country, and the Scottish market
would be very interesting to us.'
However, the directors warned that operating margins, which increased from
7.6 to 9.4 per cent last year, would come under pressure from price rises
for its pulp and paper raw materials.
Turnover on continuing businesses rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 39.8m,
despite a poor performance by Trondex, the moulded cushion packaging
business.
Stripping out acquisitions, operating profit grew 12 per cent to Pounds 3m.
Interest costs increased from Pounds 164,000 to Pounds 301,000 as the group
raised its borrowing for cash acquisitions and capital investment. Gearing
rose from 4.2 to 16.3 per cent.
Earnings per share grew 16 per cent to 4.52p (3.91p), as the number of
shares doubled.
The board recommended a final dividend of 1.1p to make a total of 1.6p
(1.25p) for the year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Strong overseas growth helps Farnell to
Pounds 28.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farnell Electronics, the components distributor and manufacturer, reported
sharply higher interim profits and turnover, reflecting strong overseas
growth and the Pounds 41m acquisition of the Multicomponents distribution
business.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 increased by 36 per cent to
Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 21.1m). Turnover grew by 77 per cent to Pounds 261m
(Pounds 147m); underlying growth was 13.5 per cent.
'Overseas growth was particularly strong,' said Mr Richard Hanwell,
chairman. Both the high volume distribution and the low-volume catalogue
businesses improved profitability overseas, he said, 'demonstrating the
success of offering customers a pan-European service'.
The Multicomponents operations, renamed Farnell Electronic Services, added
Pounds 93.7m to turnover in the first half and Pounds 2.2m to operating
profits, which increased by 40 per cent to Pounds 29.8m (Pounds 21.3m).
Overall, the overseas FES operations doubled profits on sales up 15 per
cent. In the UK, sales volumes at FES increased by 11 per cent but margins
remained under pressure.
Farnell Electronic Components reported a 22 per cent increase in profits on
sales 12.3 per cent ahead.
The UK operations achieved steady sales growth while overseas sales were up
by more than 40 per cent.
Particularly strong sales of power supplies for the telecommunications
sector helped the group's manufacturing operations to increase sales by 26
per cent, but results from Farnell Instruments were 'disappointing'.
At the end of July the group had net borrowings of Pounds 8.67m, equivalent
to gearing of 7 per cent.
Interest costs totalled Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 138,000), reflecting borrowings
undertaken to finance the purchase of Multicomponents.
Earnings per share grew by 36 per cent to 14.3p (10.5p). The interim
dividend is increased by 19 per cent to 3.8p (3.2p).
Mr Harry Elstone is to step down as finance director, although he will
remain on the board. He is succeeded by Mr Andrew Fisher.
Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, and Mr Barry Bramley, a director of
BAT Industries, are both joining the board as non-executives.
COMMENT
Once again Farnell has produced a strong underlying performance, justifying
its decision to expand its overseas operations. Following a recent strategic
review undertaken by Mr Howard Poulson, the chief executive, the company
intends to focus future growth on the higher margin catalogue distribution
business and is particularly interested in expanding in the US or east Asia
 -possibly through acquisition. Pre-tax profits should climb to about Pounds
62m this year, producing earnings of about 30.5p. At 531p, the shares are
trading on a forward multiple of 17.4 - a small discount to competitors such
as Electrocomponents - and well below their 12-month peak of 653p.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Acorn slides Pounds 1.98m into red as
schools tighten spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Acorn Computer Group, the dominant supplier of school computers in the UK,
lapsed into the red at the halfway stage as changes in education spending
patterns and the cost of new initiatives took their toll.
Turnover was flat at Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 23.6m). The deficit amounted to
Pounds 1.98m against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 and losses per share
came out at 3.2p (0.5p earnings).
Mr Sam Wauchope, managing director, said the first half was affected by
changes in the pattern of education spending as budgetary control and
financial management were devolved to schools.
Customers had also delayed purchases in anticipation of the launch in April
of the Risc PC, Acorn's new top-of-the-line offering. At the period end
there was an order backlog of more than 2,000 Risc PC systems.
The USM-traded group now comprises three companies: Acorn Computers,
Advanced Risc Machines, designer of the ARM family of low power consumption
microprocessors in which Acorn has a 47 per cent stake, and Online Media, a
new division established to exploit the emerging market for interactive
multimedia. Online Media incurred an operating loss because of start-up
costs. ARM made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m in the first half, of which
Acorn's share was Pounds 499,000.
Mr Wauchope said Risc PC was proving a success and was confident Acorn would
return to profit in the second half.

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: WMI rises 11% in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weak prices reined in profits growth at Waste Mangement International, the
UK quoted arm of WMX Technologies of the US, which yesterday announced an 11
per cent improvement in third quarter pre-tax profits.
Mr Nigel Wilson, of WMI, said the group was disappointed following a mixed
third quarter performance, in spite of strong sales growth.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 43.1m on sales 23 per cent
ahead to Pounds 288.8m. Profits for the nine months rose 14 per cent to
Pounds 125.4m on sales up 20 per cent to Pounds 831.7m.
Revenue growth in the quarter was due in roughly equal measure to
acquisitions and underlying volume gains. About 2 percentage points of the
sales improvement was down to price increases.
Mr Wilson said operating margins had slipped from 16.8 per cent to 16.2 per
cent in the quarter.
This was partly due to problems in Italy, which is WMI's single largest
market with 26 per cent of its total sales. Municipal customers in Italy
were renegotiating contracts at prices of between 10 and 20 per cent below
existing arrangements. These reductions would have to be recovered through
productivity improvements.
The company also suffered from a poor performance in the highly competitive
French market. Mr Wilson said volume at some group landfills was running at
about two thirds of peak levels.
WMI said it was pleased with volumes in the UK, and it was beginning to see
some signs of the 'significant price increases' being talked about in UK
landfill.
Mr Wilson said WMI was comfortable about prospects in the UK market, even if
Browning-Ferris Industries, the large US waste services group, wins its
hostile Pounds 364m bid for Attwoods. Such a major force could bring
'further support for stronger regulation,' which would improve the market,
the company said.
In the Asia/Pacific region, WMI enjoyed good growth in Hong Kong, a higher
margin business which would also benefit in 1995 from the landfill opened
last week.
WMI has spent Pounds 40m on 35 acquisitions so far this year. Earnings rose
by 6 per cent to 7.2p for the quarter.
Analysts are forecasting annual profits of about Pounds 175m this year, with
significant improvements from European recovery and east Asia feeding
through in 1995.

Pre-tax profits were Pounds 429,000 in the six months to June 30, compared
with a deficit of Pounds 116,000 last time.
The interim dividend, the first since 1989, is 3p, payable from earnings of
6.87p (losses of 1.86p) per share.
Turnover expanded by a quarter to Pounds 5.41m (Pounds 4.31m) and margins
increased slightly. The improvement, however, largely reflects the disposal
of its lossmaking restaurants.
The board is engaged in a prolonged power struggle which saw Sir Ian Rankin
replace Mr Anthony Kerman as chairman in August. The Kerman family controls
a quarter of the company and is understood to have been recently approached
by Scotts Holdings, a Singapore property company. Sir Ian, who is seeking to
widen the BS share ownership by attracting institutional investment, is
opposed to any sale of the entire Kerman stake to the Singapore group.
Mr Kerman did not comment yesterday on the family's intentions.
Sir Ian said the group's liquidity had been greatly improved with the
elimination of short-term borrowings and the creation of cash reserves. 'The
company, having weathered the financial storm created by its London
restaurant businesses, is now ideally positioned to take advantage of the
numerous opportunities which are presenting themselves both in leisure and
property.'

FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VSEL advances to Pounds 30.2m - BAe shares
rise 28p on market speculation about bid from GEC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker and target of an agreed bid from
British Aerospace, yesterday announced a 5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 30.2m for the six months to September 30.
The results were hurried out to coincide with the publication of BAe's offer
document.
BAe's bid offers 2.747 of its shares for each VSEL share with a cash
alternative of Pounds 11.40.
At BAe's closing price, up 28p to 498p, the bid values each VSEL share at
Pounds 13.68 and the company at Pounds 518m.
BAe shares had risen on market speculation that GEC might bid for it. VSEL
shares did not follow, however, and closed down 2p at Pounds 13.23. GEC has
declared that it is a possible bidder for VSEL.
The offer document includes details of VSEL's results. In its last full-year
statement the company predicted that its 1994-95 profits would be similar to
last year and trading profits for the first half were Pounds 24.4m compared
with Pounds 24.7m. Turnover declined from Pounds 233.2m to Pounds 194.7m.
Interest income on the company's cash pile has increased from Pounds 4.1m to
Pounds 5.8m, lifting the pre-tax result.
The interim dividend is increased from 10.5p to 12p, payable from earnings
of 52.5p (49.3p) per share.
The document says that trading continues to be in line with the board's
previous forecast.
The document also confirms that Lord Chalfont, VSEL's chairman, will become
an adviser to BAe until next July if the recommended offer goes ahead.
Mr Noel Davies, the chief executive, will also be a consultant to BAe during
the handover period.
Information made available to BAe in the course of discussions is expected
to be made available to GEC in the next day or so. Any GEC bid would be for
cash, and it would take the company some days to assess information provided
by Morgan Grenfell, VSEL's bankers.
BAe is to hold an extraordinary meeting on November 2 to approve the
takeover bid. Proxy votes must be registered by October 31.
BAe forecasts that its total dividend for 1994 will be not less than 10p, an
increase of 20 per cent on the previous year.
The offer document also discloses that VSEL is in a legal dispute with
British Shipbuilders, from which it was privatised in 1986. VSEL would be
obliged to pay British Shipbuilders (a government-owned company) an
additional amount if its profits rose above a certain level after
privatisation.
The dispute could cost VSEL up to Pounds 40m, but the company is fighting
the claim.

Increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 629,000, against Pounds 425,000, were
announced by Riva Group, the USM-quoted supplier of electronic point of sale
systems, for the half year to June 30.
The result was in line with expectations, said Mr Peter Giles, chairman.
Revenue was stable but, in common with the industry, there were declining
hardware margins.
He said the outcome for the year was sensitive to volumes in the last
quarter but was not expected to show a significant improvement on the first
half.
Turnover edged ahead to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26.4m). Losses per share deepened
to 2.5p (1.9p).

FT  18 OCT 94 / Exco chief executive to leave after rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exco, the money broker which came to market only 11 weeks ago, yesterday
become the latest debutant to produce an unpleasant surprise, announcing
that it was parting with its chief executive. Its shares fell 15p, or 8 per
cent, to close at 179p, slightly above the flotation price of 175p.
Mr Ron Sandler, 42, will resign at the end of the year. Exco said yesterday:
'Since the flotation, differences in management style have developed which
the board felt could become damaging to the business. A recent flotation
should not stop a board from making a hard decision.'
Mr Sandler, who joined Exco in April 1993, was on a 12-month contract and
will leave with a year's salary of Pounds 297,000. However, his 480,000
share options, worth potentially Pounds 500,000, and at the discretion of
the board, are not being granted.
He joined Exco from a management consultancy. His role was to guide the
money broker, in which institutional investors had taken a majority stake
the previous year from the administrators of the failed financial services
group British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, to the market.
The share issue was 3.2 times oversubscribed, valuing Exco at Pounds 220m.
The shares went to 14 per cent premium on the first day's trading, and
reached a high of 211p on August 15.
Neither Mr Sandler nor any other member of the Exco board was available for
comment. A trader at Exco said that Mr Sandler's style 'was not suited to
people management and this is a people business'. Another company source
said: 'He was not part of the club; his broking experience was limited.'
Mr Sandler previously held the post of chief executive of Bierbaum Group, a
money broking operation bought by Trio Investments at the end of 1992.
Mr Peter Edge, 36, director of global money markets, who has worked for Exco
since 1980, will take over from him.
Exco repeated yesterday that trading in the third quarter had been
'subdued'. The chairman's statement added that: 'With the caveat that
trading volumes are difficult to predict, I believe that Exco's performance
for the year as a whole will be satisfactory.'
Kleinwort Benson, Exco's broker, downgraded its profits forecast for the
current year by Pounds 2m to Pounds 45m and by the same amount to Pounds 50m
for 1995.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Eurotunnel defends track record: Efforts to limit damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, was characteristically
robust in his defence of the company's performance yesterday. He had to be.
Eurotunnel had a lot of damage to make good.
Not only were revenues well below the levels forecast in its May rights
issue prospectus, but Eurotunnel had attempted to dismiss the significance
of this development last week, triggering unfavourable comment and a slide
in its share price.
The first half of 1994 should have shown the tunnel gearing up for a full
summer service, but delays meant that it was able to launch only a limited
freight service at discount tariffs.
'Clearly, we shall end the year with a substantial shortfall in revenue
compared with earlier forecasts. But we hope to be back on track in the
second half of 1995, which is the bigger half because it has the summer
season in it,' Sir Alastair said.
These limited activities produced just Pounds 2m of revenues which was
overwhelmed by Pounds 33m of net interest and finance charges, Pounds 8m of
operating costs and Pounds 8m of depreciation charges. In the year, as a
whole Eurotunnel now expects to achieve only one quarter of the Pounds 135m
revenues forecast in its rights prospectus.
Analysts were yesterday surprised by the size of the revenue shortfall and
the shares closed down 7p at 221p. 'Anyone buying shares is really taking a
bet on whether the company actually survives and whether they make any
money,' said Mr Richard Sanderson at Panmure Gordon.
At best, he predicted, the group could expect revenues next year of Pounds
450m with all services running - some 12 per cent below Eurotunnel's
forecasts of Pounds 513m - and would not make a profit before the turn of
the century.
At UBS Securities, analyst Mr Richard Hannah said: 'To miss first-year
forecasts by this kind of margin is upsetting to say the least. One wonders
how accurate their future figures will be.'
Despite the revenue setback, Eurotunnel's management was keen yesterday to
emphasise that the company's cashflow position was not so gloomy. Cost
savings mean its cash position was Pounds 3m better than expected in the
first half while it will be 'only' Pounds 50m worse than forecast by the
year-end. This was just over 3 per cent of the Pounds 1.6bn funds raised in
May.
Eurotunnel still has Pounds 1.1bn of the loans and equity raised in May and
should not need to start drawing on any loans until next spring, by which
time it will be covering its operating costs, excluding interest payments,
from revenues.
The banks could frighten themselves into deciding they did not want to
release these loans but they would simply be denying themselves the
repayment of their earlier loans, according to Sir Alastair.
'The banks are in a difficult position,' said one analyst. 'The last thing
they want is to see it fail because they haven't come up with the necessary
finance.'
A banker at one of Eurotunnel's main lenders predicted that the conditions
over the access to the next tranche of senior debt could be relaxed next
spring. 'There is no crisis. We remain supportive,' he added.
Sir Alastair was also optimistic that Eurotunnel's share price will have
recovered enough to make it attractive for warrant holders to exercise their
warrants, worth Pounds 200m to Eurotunnel, at the 300p exercise price.
But some institutional investors said the latest figures could prove a
powerful disincentive for UK fund managers contemplating a stake in
Eurotunnel. 'Institutions have been put off by the history of delays, and
the remote prospects of earnings and dividends,' said Mr Kevin Fenelon,
investment director at Scottish Amicable.
In Paris, the Association Pour l'Action d'Eurotunnel, which represents 1,200
small shareholders, was not surprised by the figures. 'We are more concerned
with its ability to repay its capital debt when the service is fully
running,' said Ms Francoise Doumerc, the group's spokeswoman. 'We're
advising our members to wait. As long as they haven't sold shares, they
haven't lost.'

FT  18 OCT 94 / GE breaks up Kidder with sale to rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment banking subsidiary of General
Electric, will be broken up in the coming months and its most attractive
businesses transferred to Wall Street rival PaineWebber.
The deal, agreed late on Sunday and announced yesterday morning, brings to
an end GE's troubled eight-year ownership of Kidder Peabody. Rocked by an
insider trading scandal and loss-making junk bond holdings in the late
1980s, Kidder has been hit this year by tumbling bond markets and an alleged
bond trading fraud which resulted in fictitious profits of Dollars 350m.
The US industrial conglomerate said it would take a charge of about Dollars
500m as a result of the sale, taking the total cost of its ill-fated
involvement with Kidder to more than Dollars 1.5bn.
GE paid Dollars 600m for 80 per cent of Kidder in 1986 and subsequently
injected another Dollars 800m of capital. By the middle of this year, Kidder
had returned a total of Dollars 250m in profits, GE said. Since then, the
firm is understood to have lost Dollars 85m. The deal with PaineWebber is
worth a net Dollars 90m to the US industrial giant.
Under the agreement, Paine-Webber will acquire Kidder's retail stockbroking
business and its fund management operation. It will also take over parts of
the firm's investment banking and trading businesses, though final agreement
will be reached over the coming weeks.
PaineWebber will also receive Dollars 580m in net assets from GE. In return,
the securities firm said it would issue Dollars 670m of ordinary,
convertible and preferred shares to GE, which if fully converted would give
the industrial group a 25 per cent interest.
Mr Jack Welch, GE's chairman, who negotiated the original Kidder purchase,
said yesterday that the group would retain an interest in 'a much larger,
well-established franchise' in the broking industry.
The deal will further PaineWebber's ambition of becoming a full-service
investment bank, combining a retail broking force with underwriting
securities issues, advising on takeovers and trading, said Mr Donald Marron,
chairman.
Rivals pointed out, though, that the acquisition would do little to
strengthen PaineWebber's underwriting and advisory operations.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Age and fame no barrier to Kidder's fall from grace:
PaineWebber to reap the benefits as GE's investment banking unit is pulled
apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EF Hutton, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Shearson .. and now Kidder Peabody.
The list of famous names that have become casualties in the US stockbroking
and investment banking industry gained another entry yesterday. The
128-year-old Wall Street firm, battered by scandal and tumbling bond markets
this year, is to be dismantled, and up to 2,000 of its staff laid off.
Many aspects of the deal, agreed in principle on Sunday, have to be sorted
out. However, the broad outline is clear.
The General Electric unit will be split for PaineWebber to pick over,
allowing PaineWebber to expand in a number of areas - without having to take
on any of Kidder's operations it does not want. 'GE is indemnifying us
against all the liabilities of Kidder,' says Mr Donald Marron, PaineWebber's
chairman. 'GE is paying for all the down-sizing.'
PaineWebber, whose 5,000-strong retail broking force puts it among the ranks
of mid-sized brokers, is effectively raising Dollars 580m (Pounds 367m) of
new capital through the transaction, the amount of Kidder's liquid net
assets that will transfered, and it will expand its equity capital base,
which stands at Dollars 1.2bn.
In return, it welcomes GE as a minority shareholder . GE will have a seat on
PaineWebber's board. Net of the additional capital it acquires through the
transaction, PaineWebber is paying GE Dollars 90m for the Kidder businesses
it chooses.
Chief among the assets on PaineWebber's target list is Kidder's retail
salesforce - 1,150 brokers around the country who are among the most
productive in the US. Between them, these brokers generate about Dollars
500m in commissions and fees a year. Their average of Dollars 425,000 each
is well ahead of PaineWebber's estimated Dollars 300,000 average.
The problem for PaineWebber - other than the question of how it merges this
network of brokers with its own, bigger salesforce - is that every other
retail stockbroker of size in the US is likely to attempt to lure away
Kidder's most productive offices.
'There is bound to be scepticism regarding PaineWebber's ability to pull it
off,' says Mr Michael Flanagan, a securities industry analyst at Lipper
Analytical. If the firm retains all of Kidder's brokers, it will cement its
position as the fourth biggest US retail brokerage network.
On PaineWebber's immediate target list are Kidder's investment management
activities. Assets under discretionary management in this part of the
business amount to Dollars 9bn, compared with some Dollars 37bn at
PaineWebber, says Mr Marron.
The firm will also take over Kidder's equity research group; Kidder's
mortgage business; and parts of its investment banking and trading
operations.
It is these areas that raise the biggest questions. Kidder, under former
chairman Mr Michael Carpenter, had turned itself into a big fixed income
trading house, amassing a balance sheet with assets of more than Dollars
100bn. PaineWebber, by contrast, has assets of little more than Dollars 30bn
and a far less leveraged balance sheet.
While Mr Marron talked yesterday about acquiring parts of Kidder's fixed
income trading businesses - including those in London, where the firm's bond
operations provide no overlap with Kidder's US operation - he was studiously
vague about what this would involve.
Of particular interest to Wall Street is the fate of Kidder's
mortgage-backed bonds business, the biggest of its kind and the operation
which in recent years has provided the bulk of the firm's profits. GE ten
days ago said it would transfer Kidder's mortgage-backed bond portfolio to
another part of the group.
For General Electric, meanwhile, the announcement marks an ignominious end
to its eight-year involvement with Kidder - though the industrial giant was
at pains to point out that it has a substantial continuing interest in the
securities industry through its stake in PaineWebber.
'Over the long term, they don't want to be in this business,' says Mr
Michael Bunyaner, an analyst who follows GE at Oppenheimer in New York.
'They want to let someone else who knows the industry manage it.' But GE may
not rush to sell off its stake, he adds: it has a similar substantial
minority stake in the defence group Martin Marietta, demonstrating that it
is content to remain a minority partner over the long term.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Israel and Jordan agree peace plan: Historic accord is
critical to trade and economic integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan initialled a peace treaty yesterday in Amman, the
Jordanian capital, paving the way to normal relations between the two
countries and breaking down economic barriers in the Middle East.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, and King Hussein of Jordan settled
disputes over their borders and access to the region's water sources to
achieve the draft treaty. It was initialled by Mr Rabin and Mr Abdul-Salam
al-Majali, the Jordanian prime minister, at Amman's royal guest palace.
Mr Rabin immediately returned to Israel and received unanimous support from
his cabinet for the historic accord.
President Bill Clinton will attend the signing ceremony next Wednesday on
the Jordan-Israel border, marking the formal end of hostility between the
two countries which have fought three wars since 1948.
The treaty, Israel's first formal peace accord with an Arab neighbour since
the Israeli-Egyptian agreement of 1979, requires ratification by both
parliaments.
The agreement is critical for boosting economic integration and trade in the
region. It will put pressure on Syria and Lebanon to intensify peace talks
with Israel, and considerably enhance Mr Rabin's domestic standing.
The treaty will also unlock a range of planned economic projects, including
shared use of trade infrastructure, joint projects in water, energy and
tourism and trade links.
Mr Rabin said the agreement 'will set a cornerstone for a new Middle East in
which peace, development and co-operation will replace animosity, hatred and
war'.
Details of the deal have yet to be released, but Mr Rabin said the two sides
had agreed to a border based on the international boundary between Jordan
and Palestine drawn by the British in 1921, with only minor changes.
Mr Rabin said neither side had lost or won, although Jordanian and Israeli
officials said accepting the 1921 border meant that Israel had given up a
substantial part of the 350 sq km of arid land claimed by Jordan. Israeli
farmers living on part of the land would be able to stay under a leaseback
deal which recognised Jordanian sovereignty.
Israeli officials said Mr Rabin and King Hussein had spoken to President
Clinton yesterday and urged him to attend the signing ceremony. Both leaders
want to support Mr Clinton in maintaining his Democratic majority on Capitol
Hill in the November 8 congressional elections, given his administration's
huge financial and military underwriting of the Middle East peace process.
Mr Clinton was the first leader to hail the draft peace accord, saying: 'At
a time when hatred and extremism and threatening behaviour still stalk the
Middle East, this agreement reminds us that moderation and reason are
prevailing.'
Egypt also said the agreement was a step towards a comprehensive peace
settlement in the Middle East.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Revenue may invite competitive tenders for confidential tax
work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is planning to allow private companies to compete with
its own staff for vital work involving the collating of sensitive financial
information on individuals and companies.
The data are provided by banks and other financial institutions and are used
to verify information given in tax returns.
The controversial proposal concerns one of several core activities the
Revenue plans to put out to competitive tender over the next 12 months.
The move was denounced by the tax officers' union last night. Breaches of
confidentiality might arise if delicate areas of tax operations were run by
private companies, it said.
Mr Clive Brook, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation,
said: 'Taxpayers will be up in arms at what is being proposed. It raises an
issue of public concern.'
The Revenue has told staff it plans to make its Cardiff-based taxpayer
information distribution office (Tido) compete for its work with private
contractors.
The 107 staff collate information provided by banks, building societies,
insurance companies and stockbrokers. This includes the interest income
earned on bank accounts as well as details of entertainment allowances and
other benefits received by individuals and companies in the UK. It also
involves data on the transfer of properties.
The information is matched against the tax disclosures provided to the
Revenue by individuals and companies, and can be sent to local Revenue
offices if discrepancies are found. The material is stored on disks in
Cardiff.
'It is disgraceful that such material could find its way to third parties
like private companies that might use it for other business purposes,' said
Mr Brook last night.
The Revenue confirmed last night it intended to market-test the Cardiff
centre as part of the government's wider programme to introduce competitive
tendering across the civil service. But it denied the union's accusation
that this might threaten confidentiality.
In a letter to his staff, Mr Geoffrey Bush, the Revenue's director-general,
said other key areas of work to be opened up to bidding include:
The departmental security unit that advises on security matters at tax
offices;
The specific security operations of head office;
The Kew tax sorting centre and the new Nottingham-based facilities
management unit.
Mr Bush said the Inland Revenue had agreed in principle to market test these
areas after discussions with the Treasury and the government's efficiency
unit.
The director-general sought - in a letter on September 29 - to reassure
staff that while he understands market testing is a 'major area of concern'
for them, they were 'very difficult to beat' where an 'in-house bid can be
mounted'. He warned staff that in 'the present climate it is unfortunately
impossible to say there will be no compulsory redundancies'. Market testing
would 'almost certainly involve some job reductions'.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Kohl promises to maintain coalition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl held preliminary talks yesterday to re-form Germany's
conservative-liberal coalition after its parliamentary majority was
drastically reduced - from 134 to just 10 seats - in Sunday's election.
Mr Kohl promised to maintain the coalition and rejected any suggestion that
the majority might be too small to govern. He ruled out any thought of a
grand coalition with the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD). Mr Rudolf
Scharping, the SPD leader, also rejected calls from his own party to propose
such a move, while predicting that the present coalition would prove
unstable.
The coalition of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its
Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the liberal
Free Democratic party (FDP) was 'perfectly capable of government', the
chancellor said. 'In a difficult situation, the German voters have shown
confidence in us once again.'
The final election result for the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament,
gave the CDU 244 seats in a 672-seat assembly, with 50 seats for the CSU,
and 47 for the FDP. This gave a total of 341 seats for the government,
against a combined 331 for the opposition parties - the SPD, the Greens, and
the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the re-formed east German communist
party.
The size of the government majority was bolstered at the last minute by the
allocation of 16 so-called 'residual seats' to the parliament, resulting
from Germany's two-vote proportional representation. Twelve of the seats
went to the CDU, and four to the opposition SPD, giving the latter a total
of 252 seats.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the FDP, said that
coalition negotiations would begin next week, although he held a preliminary
meeting with Mr Kohl yesterday. His own party emerged from the election with
32 seats fewer than in the previous parliament, after its vote sank from 11
per cent to 6.9 per cent.
The Greens returned to the Bundestag with 49 seats, and the PDS came in with
30. Although the former communists did not win the minimum 5 per cent of the
national vote, they gained four seats in the first direct vote, all in east
Berlin, giving them the right to proportional representation.
The results mean that the majority of the opposition SPD in the Bundesrat,
the second house of parliament representing the 16 federal states, will be
reinforced.

FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: PaineWebber/Kidder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Non-financial groups do not make good parents for investment banks. General
Electric has had to admit as much by selling most of Kidder Peabody to
PaineWebber for Dollars 670m. The reason is that investment banks are unruly
and sensitive children. Too firm a hand and the most talented brokers,
traders and bankers will move to rival organisations. Too lax an approach
and trading operations can easily run up large losses. GE now stands
condemned of the latter failing. But it is also true that, in the past,
Kidder's ability to recruit suffered from the perception that GE was
excessively interventionist. Yesterday's sale is the third recent retreat by
non-financial groups from US investment banking. This year American Express
cut its connection with Shearson Lehman, while last year Sears Roebuck spun
off Dean Witter.
Though PaineWebber should be a better parent for Kidder than GE, the
acquisition will not catapult it into the investment banking big league.
Neither PaineWebber nor Kidder is large in advisory work or underwriting.
Where the combined group will be a significant force is in US retail
broking, though it will still be a long way behind Merrill Lynch and Smith
Barney. Even so, PaineWebber will have its work cut out to make a success of
the deal. Blending the cultures of the two groups will not be easy and
rivals will be circling to see if they can poach Kidder's best staff.

FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Retail sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry's September retail sales figures,
showing a sharp rise in the balance of shops reporting higher volumes, do
little to unscramble the confused signals coming from the British high
street. Although the fall in the official figures for August was widely seen
as an aberration, the City was expecting a pretty flat September picture
from the CBI. In recent months the CBI survey has tended to give a gloomier
view than the official numbers, which are being treated with increasing
caution. But those observers who justified their pessimism by arguing that
the CBI is more accurate will find today's figures tricky to explain.
The CBI believes that the weak surveys in July and August were partly due to
retailers misreading the price/volume mix of their sales growth. When
inflation was high, retailers tended to overestimate volume growth and the
CBI figures were generally better than the official numbers. During the
period of heavy discounting in the summer, the illusion worked the other
way. With the summer sales largely over, the September figure for volume
growth looks all the more impressive. Yet even those who place most faith in
the CBI figures will not get carried away. The series has been very volatile
and the average for the three months to September was unchanged from August.
Nor, given their recent poor forecasting record, will retailers' optimism
about October be given much weight. But, if tomorrow's official figures are
also better than expected, the City might start believing the leading
chains' predictions of a bright Christmas.

FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Renault
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's refusal to privatise Renault fully is a recipe for
uncommercial meddling in the company's affairs. It reflects political
sensitivities over the French car manufacturer and suggests that Renault may
be managed counter to the interests of investors.
But this will not stop the forthcoming Renault issue from being a roaring
success. It was always likely that the issue would be priced generously, if
only to avoid the embarrassment of a flop ahead of next spring's
presidential elections. So it has proved. The pricing parameters announced
yesterday are below analysts' expectations, valuing the group at
FFr39bn-FFr42bn rather than the forecast FFr45bn. Assuming the price is
fixed at the upper end of the range, the shares will be on a multiple of
some 8.5 times expected earnings for next year. This is a discount of at
least 20 per cent to Peugeot. It also compares favourably with the ratings
of other European car manufacturers which have not coped with recession so
successfully.
The issue's likely success will be accentuated by the relatively small
volume of shares allocated to institutions: 40 per cent of the total, with
even that subject to a clawback from private investors. There will be a lot
less demand for AGF, Bull and other French companies in the running to be
privatised. But that is little consolation for institutions left scrabbling
for shares in Renault.

FT  18 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel's cash crunch
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel and its advisers, SG Warburg, should be suitably red-faced for
undershooting its revenue projections by so much so quickly. Long-suffering
shareholders who subscribed to May's rights issue at 265p yesterday watched
their sterling units drop to just 221p - their lowest point since 1988.
The group's deteriorating cash position is the immediate concern. It means
Eurotunnel is unlikely to meet the conditions necessary to access its senior
debt next spring. This need not involve yet another rights issue because the
breach is likely to involve tens rather than hundreds of millions of pounds.
But it adds aggravation at a time when the management should be
concentrating on next summer's peak season.
Each time important milestones have been reached - when the boring was
completed, when the tunnel was commissioned, when the Queen and President
Mitterrand opened it - doubts have emerged. Concerns over whether the group
can generate enough revenue to cope with its interest burden should be
dispelled or confirmed next summer when the system is supposed to run at
full capacity. Three things will be needed if it is to succeed. Eurotunnel
has to ensure service quality, running fast, reliable and frequent trains;
British Rail and SNCF have to generate volumes on the city to city routes;
and Eurotunnel must avoid a price war with Stena and P&amp;O.
The auguries are not good. The margin for error is tight and Eurotunnel's
historic inability to predict even the nearest of futures does not instill
confidence. The tunnel will undoubtedly be a money-spinner at some point.
But whether under this management and for this generation of shareholders
remains doubtful.

British Rail travellers be warned: the system is running out of timetables.
London's Kings Cross station, for example, no longer stocks timetables for
journeys to Bournemouth or Liverpool. 'We haven't had all the timetables
since British Rail was split up in April,' says an assistant.
Look on the bright side: if there are no timetables, at least you won't be

The European Monetary Institute, the precursor to the European Central Bank
which has been squatting in Basle since the beginning of the year, moves to
Frankfurt next month and is inviting journalists to its new headquarters
after the mid-November council meeting.
But it seems to have gone native even before it has pitched its stall among
the preternaturally tidy-minded Teutons.
Observer, having just discovered that journalists were supposed to register
their interest (in writing) by October 7, won't be there.

Hope that professional investors attending Singer &amp; Friedlander's Company
Investor Show on Thursday pay a bit more attention than they did last year.
The idea is to give small quoted company stocks an opportunity to tell their
story to the investment community. Last year, fund managers, brokers and
analysts attending were asked to pick the three stocks that would perform
best over a six month period. No one came close to picking the winning
portfolio - car distributor William Jacks, chemical colours company European
Colour or Regent Hotels - and no prize was awarded. All jolly embarrassing.
In a bid to tickle the palates of a better class of punter, this time round
the organisers are offering a case of White Burgundy - 1992 Meursault.

The German electorate may have returned the same old chancellor at the
weekend, but look to the 30 deputies from the Party of Democratic Socialism,
successors to east Germany's former communist party, to inject a bit of
fresh colour into the next Bonn government.
Candidate for the gerontocracy is Stefan Heym, the 81-year-old writer, who,
as the oldest member of the Bundestag, qualifies to deliver the opening
speech when parliament reconvenes. The literary caucus is further bolstered
by the presence of Gerhard Zwerenz, known principally for his steamy short
stories. Heinrich von Einsiedel, the great grandson of Bismarck, should be
relied on to deliver a piquant historical perspective, as, in a different
way, should Rudolf Kutzmutz, who admits to having been an informer for the
Stasi secret police. On the distaff side, meanwhile, the formidable
Christina Schenk, an outspoken lesbian, will be rubbing shoulders with
Christa Luft, the elegant Marxist economist.
The PDS's parliamentary leader, Gregor Gysi, promises 'anything but a
boringly unified fraction'. You could say that the heirs to the faceless
grey communist party apparatchiks have come far.

What's more he says he plans to hold them at least a year and then sell them
when 'the holding shows me a 50 per cent per annum growth'. Brave words. Sir
Alastair paid Pounds 2.30 for the shares and by the close was showing a loss
of 7p a share on his latest investment. Timing has never been one of Sir

FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Three cheers for Oleg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, is proving to be an
indispensable cog in Russia's political machine. As Russia's unofficial
minister of apologies, he is the man who has to turn out at short notice to
explain away the sudden no-show of his superiors.
Three weeks ago he had to explain to Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds
why President Boris Yeltsin did not want get out of his plane at Shannon
airport. Yesterday, he turned up at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport to glad-hand
the Queen because his prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, was having too
much fun on holiday in Sochi.
The incident confirms the air of improvisation surrounding the Russian
government. Yeltsin, who has twice delayed a planned state visit to Ukraine,
decided at the weekend to put off a meeting of the Security Council to
consider a report by the federal intelligence service on the reasons for the
fall in the rouble last week.
Next Saturday's high-level meeting of the signatories of Russia's treaty on
social accord, promoted as a crucial element of the country's political
stability, has just been put off - without explanation - until December.
Finally, the parliament's legal committee has postponed Friday's vote of
confidence on the government's handling of last week's currency crash -
because the finance ministry had been unable to prepare a report on the
budget due today. Guess who was due to present that report? The overburdened
Soskovets.

FT  18 OCT 94 / 2000 and beyond: Antony Thorncroft argues that the
Millennium Commission needs to firm up its brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Millennium Commission, a handpicked band of nine of the
extremely Good and reasonably Great, are travelling the UK for ideas on how
to spend an estimated Pounds 1.6bn to celebrate the end of the second
millennium.
While they search for imaginative suggestions, they must also find a new
chief executive. For when the Commission moved into new offices in
Westminster's Little Smith Street last weekend, it was minus a boss.
Mr Nicholas Hinton, former head of the Save the Children Fund, was due to
start a Pounds 72,000-a-year job there yesterday. But last week, the
Commission's chairman, Mr Stephen Dorrell, the National Heritage Secretary,
told him his services would not be required.
In his preliminary meetings with the commissioners, Mr Hinton had proved too
interventionist. He thought he would have a decisive say in how the millions
were spent: the commissioners are seeking a more subservient bureaucrat.
Excited by the prospect of making their mark on the future, the
commissioners are not about to delegate.
However, they are saddled with implementing a scheme that has no
organisation and is without a practical, considered, brief.
The Millennium Fund, first mooted by Lord Palumbo, the former chairman of
the Arts Council, is set to receive a fifth of the proceeds from the UK's
National Lottery until the year 2001. But it is starting from scratch.
Until this weekend, the fund consisted of a seconded civil servant, Ms
Heather Wilkinson, a handful of helpers, and nine part-time commissioners,
headed by Mr Dorrell and including industry secretary Michael Heseltine.
Other commissioners were chosen for their strong regional links, or interest
in areas likely to receive Millennium money. The Honourable Robin Dixon was
ideal as an Olympic athlete from Northern Ireland; the Earl of Dalkeith can
speak for Scotland and the heritage; and journalist Simon Jenkins is
interested in architecture and has a Welsh background.
But choosing the commissioners was the easy part. Deciding how the
Millennium Fund should operate and what it should spend the money on is
proving more difficult. The only guidelines were provided in a short speech
by the former heritage secretary Peter Brooke.
In it, he urged the commission to 'seek to capture the spirit of our age in
enduring landmarks that symbolise our hopes for the future'. Millennium
projects should be those that would probably not otherwise happen, he added.
'Above all, the Millennium Commission's legacy should form a permanent
enhancement of our national heritage'.
Not much detail there, although Mr Brooke had his own favourite ideas. He
wanted a big Millennial Festival, and was keen on bursaries. On the
projects, particularly the grand works that will absorb around half the
fund's expenditure, the brief was wide open.
If the commissioners want to, they can reject all the likely front runners.
The new Tate Gallery of Modern Art on London's Bankside is a strong
candidate - it represents contemporary art and it is international. But it
is planning to move into a converted 1940s power station rather than a brand
new 21st-century structure, hardly fitting for the new Millennium, the
commissioners might decide.
They can suggest to the proposed Cardiff Opera House that it goes to the
Welsh Arts Council for its funding. They can point the revamped South Bank
Centre towards the fifth of the lottery assigned to heritage projects. All
can be criticised for not occupying new buildings, or for having possible
alternative sources of lottery funding.
This should add up to plenty of work for the nine part-timers. But the
Commission will also be distributing thousands of small local grants, of
Pounds 10,000 upwards. And the commissioners seem unwilling to hand over
responsibility for these much smaller projects to a bureaucracy.
This is perhaps understandable. The Millennium money comes from millions of
ordinary citizens spread across the land, with the majority living far from
a national opera house and art galleries. The government is keen that they
should benefit. But how? The commissioners' tour for grass-roots projects
has had little success to date.
Most of the suggestions are outside the scope of the Fund - improving the
health service, or education, or transport are already the responsibility of
existing government institutions. Many are worthy but banal - like giving
every village a millennial clock, or (the prime minister's suggestion)
giving every community hall a computer. Few seem keen on a giant ferris
wheel on the banks of the Thames. The Channel Tunnel has deterred plans for
great engineering ventures. Environmental ideas - inner-city parklands and a
new Caledonian Forest - look likely winners.
The government proclaims it wants an independent body, but the commission is
an obvious source for some 'feel good factor' in the run up to the next
election.
However, without guidelines and a bureaucracy that can take decisions, the
Millennium Commission looks like becoming a huge bottleneck with plenty of
money, but not enough time.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Battle to hold the middle lane: Quentin Peel examines the
challenges ahead for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the small hours of Germany's Monday morning, any normal political animal
would have been wide awake, frantically following every last election return
to determine the fate of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.
Computer predictions put his overall majority at two seats, a cliff-hanging
result well within any normal margin of error. Only three-quarters of the
seats were counted by midnight, and most of the remainder were in
unpredictable territory in east Germany. On the face of it, it could have
gone either way.
But in Bonn, at midnight, most German political animals were in bed.
In the first place, Mr Kohl had said he had won, so they believed it.
Indeed, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD), had virtually admitted defeat. And secondly, they knew that
even a two-vote majority would not necessarily spell chaos and instability
in the German political system.
Long past bedtime, it emerged that the chancellor's conservative-liberal
coalition had actually survived with a 10-seat majority, a dramatic drop
from its lead of 134 in the outgoing parliament, but, in Mr Kohl's words, 'a
perfectly good working majority'.
Yesterday, the markets took it all in their stride. The Frankfurt stock
exchange put on an initial 2 per cent, before falling back later in the day
in 'muted' trade. The bond market was up. The atmosphere was relaxed.
But the political establishment was split down the middle over whether the
current coalition would survive its full four-year term.
'They won't even last a year,' Mr Rudolf Dressler, social affairs spokesman
of the SPD, said yesterday. 'There is no reason why they shouldn't survive a
full term,' said Mr Klaus Beck, head of the Bonn liaison office of the trade
union federation.
Everyone accepts that a tiny majority is not in itself a disaster. Former
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt survived with a 10-seat majority from 1976-1980,
and his predecessor, Mr Willy Brandt, had a 12-seat margin from 1969-1972.
The government of the north German state of Schleswig-Holstein has been in
power with a one-seat majority since 1992. There are no mid-term
by-elections, and German governments are anyway slow-moving, consensus-based
creatures, which avoid conflicts at all costs.
The trouble for Mr Kohl is that his coalition contains political strains
which have been under pressure for several years and the finely-balanced
election result could just bring them to breaking point. And the government
agenda in the coming four years is certain to include some issues that could
provide the material for deep divisions.
For a start, it must tackle the question of tax reform, of both income tax,
which is the chancellor's priority, and company tax. Another key question is
the soaring cost of the welfare state, and how to control it. Privatisation
and deregulation are also potentially divisive issues for the members of the
coalition. And so is the need to take tougher action to enforce law and
order, and cope with organised crime.
Only foreign policy looks to be an area of relative harmony.
Everything depends on the highly unpredictable Free Democratic Party (FDP),
the liberal minority partner in the ruling coalition, and the big loser in
Sunday's general election. It emerged from the poll with just 47 members in
the 672-seat Bundestag, compared with 79 in the previous parliament. But it
still holds the balance of power between Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats and
the opposition SPD.
The party, led by Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, has fought a string
of disastrous election campaigns during the year, losing all its seats in 10
state parliaments, and in the European parliament, because it failed to get
more than the required 5 per cent minimum share of the vote. In east
Germany, in particular, its philosophy of free market liberalism has failed
to find any response.
It scraped into the Bundestag on Sunday night, largely thanks to votes
transferred by CDU supporters. People who said they voted FDP as they
emerged from the polling stations were asked which party they really
favoured. No fewer than 63 per cent said CDU, compared with only 16 per cent
for the FDP itself.
The FDP is now the smallest member of the coalition - the Bavaria-based
Christian Social Union (CSU) has 50 seats. Yet the irony is that it is more
politically powerful, because of the paper-thin majority, than it was over
the past four years.
Mr Kinkel is totally committed to the current coalition. He fought the
entire election on that basis. But he knows that over the next four years he
has to win a clear political profile for his own party if it is to survive
the next election at all. The FDP has to take a clear, independent position
on issues. The question is whether it can best do that within the ruling
coalition, or outside it.
On tax reform, the FDP, the CDU and the CSU are not too far apart, although
the FDP is clearly more radical in the reduction it would wish to see in
company tax.
It is also more potentially radical on deregulation and privatisation. A big
issue for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, has been the need to
make the energy market more competitive, and another has been to deregulate
the retail sector - both issues on which he has met solid opposition from
the more conservative CDU/CSU.
But the most potentially contentious area is social spending cuts, where the
FDP is also more radical than its more powerful partners.
'The dilemma of the FDP is that they will be tempted to try to get more
profile by being in the forefront of moves to deregulation and to slim the
welfare state,' according to one top political adviser. 'But they know first
of all that the CDU is much more cautious. And Mr Kohl knows that these are
issues on which he needs the support of the Bundesrat (the second house of
parliament representing the 16 federal states). The Bundesrat has an SPD
majority, and on such issues, he will never get that support. So he has to
resist the FDP.'
Social spending issues nearly brought disaster during the past four years,
first over reform of the health service, and then over setting up a new
insurance scheme to finance nursing care for the old and handicapped. The
FDP backed down, but next time, it might decide not to.
The other key area of contention could be law and order, for the FDP still
contains a strong libertarian wing, committed to generous immigration
policies, good race relations, and a determined resistance to police
surveillance, such as bugging telephone lines. Mr Kohl will be pushing for
tougher action on law and order, to fulfil his election promises.
Only on Europe are the coalition members in broad agreement, although Mr
Kohl is perhaps more passionate about the need for further European
integration.
But any of those issues could be the one the FDP chooses to use to seek a
new profile, if the party leadership decides that is the best strategy.
Mr Kohl, on the other hand, will bend over backwards to keep his coalition
together. He knows that the alternative - a grand coalition with the SPD -
was a disaster for his party before, when it paved the way for a change of
power to an SPD-FDP alliance. He will thus seek to accommodate the liberals,
within the limits of his need to work with the SPD majority in the
Bundesrat. That is where a de facto grand coalition already exists.
That is perhaps why the German body politic, and the financial markets, can
afford to be so relaxed about such a close election result. But it still
leaves the future clouded by uncertainty, and the fate of Mr Kohl in the
hands of his unreliable partner, Mr Kinkel.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Precarious peace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Middle East peace process took another important step forward yesterday
with the initialling of an outline agreement between Israel and Jordan. With
the Hashemite kingdom now joining the Palestinians on the path completed
only by Egypt, there is a mounting sense that the process is irreversible.
Confidence would have been greater had it not been for events last week in
Israel, where Palestinian extremists came alarmingly close to wrecking much
of what had been achieved. The alarm is all the greater because the main
proponents of peace knew all too well of the dangers in over-reacting to
such calculated provocation. Hamas, on the one hand, and a Jewish extremist
fringe on the other, have both shown this year their capacity for
politically motivated murder. The terror attack by Hamas in central
Jerusalem last week, and the subsequent kidnap and killing of an Israeli
soldier, are part of a depressingly predictable pattern.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is right to expect that the
Palestinian police force should maintain order in the newly-liberated
territories. But to attempt to link the future of the peace negotiations
with the ability of the Palestinian police to prevent Hamas from committing
acts of terror in Israel proper is dangerous.
Although Mr Rabin and Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, find no
pleasure in each other's company, they share a common objective in seeking
to blunt the appeal and activities of Hamas in its bid to sabotage the peace
agreement. To this end, the security forces of both sides need to
co-operate, not to apportion exclusive responsibility and subsequent blame
for security failures. At the same time, the two men need to work on
limiting the appeal of Hamas to the wider Palestinian population, which
means redressing the economic deprivation and political grievances that are
still rife throughout the occupied West Bank and liberated parts of the Gaza
strip.
There is culpability on both sides for failing to move the peace process
forward with greater urgency. Mr Arafat's reluctance to consult or delegate
has delayed the creation of an effective bureaucracy, and with it hundreds
of millions of dollars in international aid. Mr Rabin's desire to tie down
every last detail of each accord in a way which stifles any sense of
Palestinian self-determination has served to dissipate much of the goodwill
that surrounded the initial breakthrough.
Withdrawal of Israeli forces from the rest of the West Bank and elections
for Palestinians to choose legitimate leaders are urgently needed. Israel
should allow the elections fairly to reflect Palestinian opinion and should
recognise their results, whether they legitimise Mr Arafat's leadership or
replace him with others more capable of pursuing Palestinian aspirations.
The practice of democracy can only assist peace.
The agreement initialled in Amman yesterday has contributed to sustaining
the wider momentum for peace, while continuing US efforts offer hope for
progress between Israel and Syria. But events of the past week have been a
reminder of how critical the core issue of Israel's relations with its
Palestinian neighbours is to the entire fabric of peace.

Last week the ex-chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, declared himself 'unable to
pinpoint a single concrete economic advantage' that comes to the UK from its
membership of the European Union. A trip to Cleveland and Durham ought to
make him think again.
Samsung and Fujitsu yesterday joined a growing list of foreign companies
that have recently decided to invest substantially in their UK sites. Such
companies are apparently happier to invest in the UK's economic future than
many of their home-grown counterparts have been of late. But Mr Lamont and
others should be under no illusions: these foreign direct investors are
betting money on a future within the EU, not without it.
Not so long ago, yesterday's announcements by Samsung and Fujitsu would have
been met with little but complaints. Once the world's leading manufacturer,
the UK was said to be becoming merely a site for the 'screwdriver'
operations of foreigners eager to escape European import barriers.
Why are these complaints not heard today? Some would put it down to a new
realism about the UK's economic options. But it is also the fact that
Japanese direct investment has yielded considerable benefits to both sides.
The latest census data indicates that foreign-owned manufacturing
enterprises achieved an average 31 per cent higher net output per employee
than domestically-owned enterprises in 1991. This is to be expected: the
companies coming to the UK are some of the most successful in the world. But
that is merely another argument in favour of such investment.
Low-cost labour, the English language and membership in the EU are clearly a
large part of the UK's attractiveness. The Nissan plant in Sunderland, for
example, was a simple assembly operation for European sales when it was
announced in 1984. From such beginnings, however, grew a plant that is now
the UK's largest car exporter, employing 4,600, up from an initial 470. With
luck, Cleveland and Durham will provide similarly good examples for UK
companies to follow. Maybe the latter should also acquire the Asians' quiet
trust that the sentiments of Mr Lamont and others will not prevail.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Weaker rule in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the robust confidence displayed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday,
his margin of victory in Sunday's German elections was uncomfortably narrow.
The centre-right coalition's 10-seat Bundestag majority appears insufficient
to guarantee passage of tough measures needed to improve Germany's economic
structure, particularly cuts in public spending and taxation, and social
security reform.
Modest recovery from recession will continue, but so will voter
disgruntlement caused by cuts in real incomes needed to correct
post-unification economic imbalances. Mr Kohl's domestic problems may divert
his attention from necessary efforts to show German leadership over European
integration.
Mr Kohl owes his fourth term in office to his considerable electioneering
skills, mistakes by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), and the innate
conservatism of the German electorate, which since the war has never ejected
an incumbent government. None the less, there is a risk that the coalition
between the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP)
may not last the full four-year parliamentary mandate.
The share of the vote registered on Sunday by both senior parties, the CDU
and SPD, was well below the average of the past 30 years. Voting
fragmentation, reflected in the strength of the Greens and reformed east
German communists (PDS), will make the future policies and alliances of
government and opposition prone to complex political arithmetic.
Reflecting the shrunken Bundestag majority and the Social Democrats' hold
over the Bundesrat, which has a veto over tax legislation, the coalition's
power to introduce radical legislative initiatives has now crumbled. It is
true that Chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt survived two past
legislative periods with similarly slender majorities. However, in 1969 and
1976 the Social Democrats' comparatively fresh coalition with the Free
Democrats was probably in a fundamentally stronger state than Mr Kohl's
12-year-old government.
Much will depend on how the Free Democrats adjust to the loss of power and
prestige caused by a string of election setbacks. Mr Kohl's recent rejection
of his coalition partner's calls for tax cuts indicates the FDP's
difficulties in maintaining its traditional high profile as an exponent of
free market policies. On the other hand, the FDP leadership, knowing that
many voters now see it as little more than an ersatz CDU, seems unlikely to
risk a trial of strength with Mr Kohl by threatening to defect to the SPD in
mid-term.
The questions facing the SPD under its chairman and future parliamentary
floor-leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, are still more painful. It has lost four
successive general elections, and leadership divisions during the recent
campaign have left fresh scars. Mr Scharping's task is to mount an energetic
yet constructive challenge to Mr Kohl, particularly over economic policy,
that will strengthen the SPD's credentials as a party of government. Given
the SPD's strength in the Bundesrat, the new government in Bonn will in some
ways be behaving like a de facto Grand Coalition. If Mr Scharping can use
his leverage wisely, and restrain those within his party wishing an overt
alliance with the PDS or the Greens, he may yet reap his reward.

<TEXT>
The 'Charles and Diana' story is the opium of the people. It attracts
immense interest in most countries, but at home it does more. In Britain,
gossip about the private life of the scions of the House of Windsor is an
obsession of the tabloids, a quick-seller for the serious newspapers,
dominant on the airwaves, an easy topic of conversation, the stuff of
fantasy and scribblers' invention, marginal, fluffy, inconsequential - and,
as such, a substitute for thought, a painkiller for a bewildered national
psyche. It is, in short, a constant distraction from genuine problems of
governance, evidence of a polity thrashing around for a sense of purpose.
The latter is the serious element in an essentially unserious flow of media
pap. It may be that this flow has latterly been stimulated by the heir to
the throne and his estranged wife, but that is beside the point. The British
people approach the end of the 20th century as uncertain about their role in
the world as at any time since the end of empire. Historians will be
justified if they label it the century of moral decline.
The final decade is already looking inglorious. A prize for literature is
awarded to a 'novel' widely acknowledged to be illiterate. A fund is set up
to spend the proceeds of a national lottery on celebrating the millennium,
but no one, not even the minister in charge, has articulated a clear idea of
what that means, or what there is to celebrate. At a conference of the
governing party, a yob makes a successful bid for the front pages by lifting
his kilt for the cameras.
We affect to be shocked, but our sensibilities are numbed. Nothing is
sacred, least of all religion. There is some tut-tutting when a clergyman is
dismissed for professing a lack of belief in God. Several of our television
comedians appear to be motivated by a militant, even spiteful, atheism. The
end of deference may be welcome, but in its place has come - a void. We
revel in titillating accounts of the sexual misdemeanours of this or that
government minister and affect surprise when we hear that various officials,
elected and appointed, appear to have been lining their own pockets, or
allowing their relatives to do so. We live in the kingdom of Grab, an empty
commonwealth in which, when financial fiddles are revealed, some wonder
whether the misdemeanour lies in the act, or the getting caught.
In such a world, prattle about whether the monarchy will survive the war of
the royal books is mere escapism. Prince Charles and Princess Diana have
been subsumed into the production line of the media; they have become its
primary raw material, second only to paper. They are the prince and princess
of publishing. Their original image, that of the shyly spooning couple, was
a romantic fiction in the preparation of which they connived. They are now
assisting in the manufacture of the salacious prose that may diminish or
possibly even destroy one or both of them.
Does it matter? At the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth last
week the senior minister at our dining-table was asked what he made of it
all. 'You are addressing the wrong person,' came the reply. 'I give little
thought to these things. All we need to know is that most voters are
monarchists. Nearly all of them hold the Queen in high regard. End of
story.'
Mr John Major concurs. 'I think the monarchy has got its roots sunk so deep
in the affairs of the people of this country that it is very sound and
secure,' the prime minister said yesterday. His confidence is supported by
precedent. Two centuries have passed since James Gillray's caricatures
savagely attacked the extravagance and promiscuous behaviour of the
'voluptuary', the then Prince of Wales. The crown survived. Nearly 60 years
have flown by since the abdication of Edward VIII was forced upon him when
he declared his intention of marrying Mrs Wallis Simpson, the American
divorcee. His niece is still on the throne.
There is no constitutional reason why the Queen's eldest son should not
succeed her. That he shall do so is, as it happens, the essence of the
British constitution. The Prince's qualification for the job is that he is
of his mother born. His private behaviour is irrelevant. This is not a
change of mind on my part. I have long advocated the setting up of a federal
republic of Britain, on the ground that the executive hides behind 'crown
prerogative' as an excuse for misgovernment. Hanging everything on the tag
of the supposed royal command is a licence to print honours, a permit for
the exercise of patronage.
Yet I would cheerfully salute the accession of Prince Charles if the throne
were first to become detached from the executive, made contractually
subservient to the people, and defined in a written constitution. It might
then usefully be slimmed down, becoming a 'bicycle monarchy' as in northern
Europe. It would certainly benefit from a period of reticence about itself,
as the Duke of Edinburgh intimated yesterday. In such clearly-defined
circumstances, the role of an hereditary king as a focus of loyalty to the
nation - that is, of all of us to one another - could as well be fulfilled
by Prince Charles as anyone. Better that, as they said at the recent Liberal
Democrat conference in Brighton, than President Tebbit or, heaven help us,
President Thatcher.
Meanwhile Queen Elizabeth II is more likely than not to reign well into the
next century. The first queen bearing her name ruled during a flowering of
English culture; hers were years of national glory. The second Elizabeth,
possessed of few powers, has been less fortunate. She has been able to
reign, but not rule. She has been steadfast and dutiful, but her governments
have not covered themselves in glory. They have left the nation uncertain
about whether it belongs to the continent to which it is attached.
As a nuclear power and permanent member of the security council, Britain
retains the vestiges of its 'great' past, but lacks the self-confidence to
participate wholeheartedly in the affairs of the European Union. We cling to
illusory 'certainties', such as 'sovereignty' and the idealised Victorian
royal family. We know that reality lies elsewhere. Some - perhaps most - of
us cannot bear the knowledge. To get through the night, we tune in to
'Charles and Di,' and go back to sleep.

<TEXT>
Sir, Norman Lamont's thoughts concerning the UK and the European Union place
him some time in the first decade of this century ('Lamont says it may be
necessary to pull out of EU', October 12). He need only look beyond his
small island to see that the UK will wither and shrivel if it cuts itself
off from the continent.
The economic power centres of the world are shifting to the east. China's
enormous potential is only beginning to be realised.
Among the great advantages China has over western Europe is that it has so
much to do in order to modernise. Not having progressed at the rate of the
west, China can make use of the latest technologies without having to
consider a loss on its investment in earlier technology.
China will indeed make its 'great leap forward'. Without strong competition
from a united Europe and a reinvigorated North America, China will be far
ahead by the middle of the new century.
In the face of the progress of China and some of the other countries in East
Asia, the UK is not in a position to go it alone. Like the rest of Europe
(of which, like it or not, it is a part), the UK will have to find strength
in union.
The only other alternative I can see is for the UK to halt all further
development and to turn the whole country into a museum. In 20 years or so
the nation and its people could make a decent living by charging admission.
How quaint it would be.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: University reform proposal is recipe
for destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof TONY POINTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'University reform' (October 11), while being music to
the ears of certain pressure groups who would subordinate a rational system
of higher education to self-interest, will probably be quoted (and - God
help us - used) to wipe out the UK system of higher education as an
international competitor.
You suggest 'a designated 20 or so universities' should be funded to do
research, while others would be restricted to being teaching institutions.
What this would mean is that there would be 20 universities in the UK. That
may be an aim espoused by the Financial Times - although there is absolutely
no logic advanced for it.
Of course, many universities are currently inadequately funded to carry out
their functions as places of teaching,learning and scholarship. The FT's
contribution appears to be to propose they are destroyed before they can
collapse.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Foreign entrants to Italian retail
market will need to seek partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN D. GORDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Neil Buckley's article, 'Retailers' global shopping spree' (October
13), cited Italy as one of the 'tough three' markets. We can confirm that it
is 'tough', especially for foreigners. It is changing rapidly, but 'a
l'Italienne'.
We have made four large studies of food retailing in Italy - the first in
1980 when the balance of power was firmly with producers and their problem
was physical distribution costs in serving the large market. Those of 1987
and 1989 showed some increasing retailer toughness, but multinational
producers still got 20-30 per cent higher prices for their grocery products
in Italy than in France or Germany due to the semi-collusive relationship
with retailers to maintain high prices.
Our new study, just published, shows that, while pending legislative changes
will probably allow the big to get bigger, the basic objective of large
Italian retailers is to keep out any large foreign invasion (as in Spain)
and ensure foreign entrants come in via a partner (for example, franchising)
or on a joint venture basis.
There are examples of acquisition by Carrefour and Tengelmann, but the
candidates are small and individually give little position.
Auchan has been trying to start from scratch in Italy and has hardly made
any progress, mainly due to bureaucratic obstruction. Foreign discount
chains with small units are making some progress because of the lower threat
to local interests.
The Coop is the largest retailer in Italy and voluntary chains and buying
groups have a strong presence. The integrated 'five sisters' (Rinascentre,
Standa, GS, Esselunga and Pam), plus the Coop, currently only hold 21 per
cent of grocery food sales.
We forecast, however, that the top five groups (all categories) will hold 40
per cent in 2000.
Producers are meeting growing demands for discounts, longer delays in
payments, increased publicity costs, and tougher logistics requirements,
while private label is starting to gain momentum. While Italian retailing is
concentrating, potential foreign retailer entrants, to be successful, will
have to find a suitable Italian partner.
It is not for nothing that in the cold-war days Italians boasted they would
have converted invading Russian soldiers into Italians in 12 months.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basis for manufacturing's pleas
survives intact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Robinson (Letters, October 11) errs in appearing to equate fixed
investment in plant and equipment (p and e) with manufacturing investment in
p and e. In fact, manufacturing now only accounts for 28.5 per cent of total
p and e investment in the UK economy, down from 48 per cent in the early
1960s; the services, broadly defined to include internationally exposed and
sheltered segments, account for the majority of economy-wide p and e
investment.
UK manufacturing's miserable record in p and e investment can be gauged from
the fact it now accounts for just 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product -
against 3.2 per cent in the early 1960s. In absolute terms, UK
manufacturing's p and e investment is no higher (at constant prices) than 20
years ago, but then output is no higher either.
The UK's comparative investment record internationally can best be gauged
from the following data of the share of total manufacturing investment as a
percentage of gross domestic product (averages for 1980-1992): UK: 2.1 per
cent; Germany: 3.1 per cent; France: 3.2 per cent; Italy: 4 per cent.
Quite why UK manufacturing stagnates despite the recent sharp recovery in
profits remains a mystery.
But the statistical basis for the industrial associations' pleas for fiscal
incentives survives Peter Robinson's strictures intact.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Clear and velvet tones at their best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms GAIL CHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am writing to protest at your music critic's review of Kathleen
Battle's recital with the Philharmonia ('Battle with the Philharmonia',
October 14). To say that her rendering of Mozart's Exultate Jubilate was 'a
boring vocal display' is both grossly unfair and pitifully inaccurate.
It is well known that Miss Battle does not have a loud booming voice. I was
sitting quite far back in the hall and I was apprehensive that I might not
hear well. However, I found that I could hear her quite clearly.
The piece was sung with on abundance of subtle tone colours. Far from 'one
mezzo-forte-ish dynamic' she maintained a beautifully controlled and
sustained fortissimo which was never harsh and strident. She sang with an
apparently effortless mastery of the music which left the audience in a
state of joyful bliss - as was evidenced by the prolonged and enthusiastic
applause.
It is to Andre Previn's credit that he composed his song cycle Honey and Rue
for Battle's voice. The result was truly magnificent. We were treated to a
display of her velvet tones at their best, full of light and shade, and
great warmth: a heavenly interpretation with its high point the fourth song
'Do you know him' which, far from calling for 'earthiness', requires and was
rendered with a beautiful timeless ethereal quality. Only a very unmusical
person could fail to be moved.
It is indeed sad when such great artistry is so ill received and
unrecognised.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Personal View: A case of cut and thrust - Russia's record of
economic management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOCHEN WERMUTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In early 1994, Russia's economic prospects looked bleak. Industrial
production and gross domestic product had fallen dramatically, inflation was
running at almost 20 per cent a month and there were plans for a costly
monetary union with Belarus.
Critics said the government had given up on economic reform, an assertion
seemingly given new life last week by the dive of the rouble to almost
Rbs4,000 to the US dollar.
In fact, the Russian authorities have implemented an unprecedented austerity
programme during 1994: policymakers have responded to shortfalls in revenue
with severe expenditure cuts, and high real interest rates have been
maintained.
As a result, inflation is at its lowest levels since the economic reforms
began and lending by the central bank has been so low that Russia has for
the first time met its IMF monetary policy targets. At the same time,
economic recovery is under way.
One reason for the critics' gloom is the fall in government revenue. Budget
revenue has fallen from 29.5 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 1993
to 26.3 per cent in the first half of 1994. This was due to changes in
legislation, a profit squeeze as GDP fell and real wages stayed constant,
and an increase in tax evasion.
However, the response to low revenue was not the widely-expected hike in
central bank lending to government. Instead, government expenditure was cut
from 35.3 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 1993 to 32.8 per cent in
the first half of 1994.
This is, by any standards, a serious fiscal austerity programme. It has been
matched by successful efforts to increase tax compliance.
Another argument raised by critics is that monetary policy has been 'loose'
because the central bank is lending to the government at 10 per cent a year,
well below market rates.
However, the amount of central bank lending to the government is restricted
by credit ceilings. Because of these, quarterly central bank lending to
government fell over the first half of 1994 from 8.8 per cent of GDP to 7.9
per cent.
Meanwhile, lending to other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States has stopped. And lending to commercial banks is at high real interest
rates, since the central bank has maintained high real refinance rates since
November 1993.
The last batch of central bank credits at low interest rates - the so-called
'soft credits' - was allocated in the spring. Since then, soft credits have
been counted as part of federal government expenditure and are no longer a
source of monetary expansion.
True, government borrowing from the Central Bank of Russia rose in July and
August. But this was a deliberate move. The government is required by the
parliament to make annual expenditure equal to the sum of tax revenues and
approved borrowing. In 1992 and 1993, pressures from the former state
enterprises and farms led to high levels of borrowing in the fourth quarter
and a resurgence in inflation. This time, the government borrowed more in
the third quarter to head off lobby pressures.
By September nominal borrowing had fallen to half the level of August. The
October figures, in line with government targets, are similarly low.
Officially agreed credit limits for the fourth quarter are at a record low
and could be as little as 3 to 5 per cent of GDP if some borrowing is
replaced by sales of governmental currency reserves, as planned.
Thanks to such restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, the Russian
authorities have met the IMF monetary base target - even with the spring's
soft credits and additional borrowing in the third quarter.
Despite the higher inflation rates of recent months and the recent collapse
of the rouble, annual inflation this year is not expected to exceed 180 per
cent, down from over 800 per cent in 1993 and over 2,400 per cent in 1992.
Monetary growth at the end of 1994 could average 3 per cent a month -
providing ideal conditions for stabilisation in 1995.
In spite of this restrictive policy stance, unemployment remains low and a
recovery seems under way. Official GDP for August 1994 was 20 per cent
higher in constant prices than in January, and 12 per cent higher than in
August 1993. Industrial production troughed in May 1994 and has grown by
around 1 per cent a month since. These figures are supported by statistics
on energy consumption and evidence of a construction boom.
What prevents the country from taking off even faster are outstanding
reforms in the energy and agricultural sectors, hidden subsidies to powerful
lobbies and enterprises, and the failure to make enterprises bankrupt when
they have no future.
The lack of an institutional framework for investors, such as registers to
establish title to land, also means there is a lack of capital. Domestic
saving has been low and Russia has remained a net exporter of capital. The
government has been working on macro-economic policies for the next 10 years
to pay back foreign debt. These include commitments that should help to
attract long-term investment.
Furthermore, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, rejected the first
budget and monetary programme for 1995, which aimed at an average inflation
rate of 5 per cent a month. Instead, on October 9, the government, supported
by the president, set a budget deficit target for 1995 of 4-5 per cent of
GDP. The government plans to finance a large part of this deficit by issuing
Treasury bills and with what could well be the last significant injection of
foreign credits, rather than through central bank lending to government. At
the same time, a stable exchange rate is to be maintained.
As a result of these plans, inflation should be down to less than 1 per cent
a month by the second half of 1995 and annual inflation is forecast at 27
per cent for 1995. This is the culmination of a two-year policy of a gradual
but substantial reduction in inflation.
Given economic fundamentals, the government's tough policy, and the increase
in the central bank's refinancing rate, the recovery of the rouble after its
fall last week is no surprise. The real exchange rate is, in fact, no lower
than it was in December 1993.
However, last week's rapid devaluation is a warning to policy-makers against
any return to loose policies. Genuine exchange rate stability is thus more
politically feasible.
Russia is on the brink of moving beyond crisis management and could soon be
a G8 country with low inflation, low inflationary expectations and low
medium-term interest rates.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: The Poisoned Chalice - Music Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The one virtue of The Poisoned Chalice, an opera scripted and composed by
Tony Britten, being premiered by Music Theatre London at the Drill Hall, is
brevity. Its two acts are not much more than half an hour apiece. The
interval is on you just as you feel the need to run out screaming into
Chenies Street; and those who steel themselves to go back in will be pleased
to find that this is unusual among bad operas in lacking the defect of
long-windedness.
Indeed, its concision is like a slap in the face. The four characters in
brilliant white process at the start on to Simon Higlett's tilted silver
disc, deliver some solemn choral thoughts, and embark on what will be very
many individual circlings of the platform, singing as they walk, taking care
to avoid the little tree, and all involved in a drama that has evidently
been going on for some time before we arrived. Gradually we settle into the
idea that this is a story and not just a bawling contest, and recognise old
friends in Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and Morgan Le Fay.
For it is the 'Matter of Britain' that Tony Britten says has always, since
childhood, drawn him on and driven him to pen the doggerel libretto and
doggerel-like score of this Chalice. His feeling for prosody is remarkable -
extra syllables just crammed in where necessary and the music stretched to
fit. What he says is even worse than how he says it: utterances of pure
unmisgiving bathos which contaminate you with the deadly, confident clasp of
bad art.
Britten - an artistic director of Music Theatre London, along with the
evening's stage-director Nicholas Broadhurst - has composed much for
television and films, but the Chalice's music has scarcely the inventiveness
of a soap-powder jingle. It was performed by a quartet consisting of
conductor/keyboardist Jonathan Rutherford with flute, cello and percussion
players at least two of whom were not the musicians named in the programme.
Perhaps they had bolted in horror at an insipid tonal idiom - tonal, that
is, with a few obligatory raucous gesturings - which seemed to my unlucky
companion like the Hecklers' answer to the Birtwistle opera Gawain they so
deplored.
It must have been a hard job finding the singers, too. Swedish soprano Sara
Jungberg's Morgan at least had some sort of voice. Mary Lincoln's Guinevere
tried hard to make us believe she had one. Both parts, alas, required
considerable vocal prowess. Billy Hartman's Lancelot was too stiff, Andrew
C. Wadsworth's Arthur not stiff enough. He just slouched there in his burlap
with the cool self-possession of someone about to order a drink. At the
opera's end each character is resolved into an allegorical single word -
'Stability' (Arthur), 'Honour' (Lancelot), 'Power' (Morgan), 'Love'
(Guinevere) - which they keep repeating. 'Love' has the last word. But I
should add 'Vanity'. This is a show that should never have reached the
boards.

Does it matter that Takin' Over The Asylum tacitly conveys the message that
most of the people in mental hospitals are rather charming eccentrics who
are kept inside largely because other people are intolerant of their quirky
little habits? Given the misery caused in some homes by the presence of
those with mental illnesses it seems unfortunate to say the least, yet last
week's episode was undeniably an entertaining piece of drama (9.00 BBC2).
This week's drama in the C4 series Alan Bleasdale Presents is Jim Morris's
play 'Blood On The Dole' which was first performed at the Liverpool
Playhouse in 1981: 'Four Merseyside teenagers struggle to forge their own
identities in an unsympathetic world blighted by unemployment and social
deprivation' (10.00). In the week when the first volume of Doris Lessing's
autobiography is published, she talks on Omnibus about her childhood in
Rhodesia and her move to England (BBC 1). We have heard a lot recently about
the assassination of Nicholas and Alexandra and their family in Russia in
1918 and we are not finished yet: Network First (10.40 ITV).

FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: Master of simple authority - William Packer admires a
magnificent review of Poussin's work in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicolas Poussin is one of the great panjandrums of the history of painting.
Almost the exact contemporary of Rembrandt in Holland and Velasquez in
Spain, he was the greatest French painter of the 17th century, indeed the
first great French painter of the modern, post-Renaissance era.
That he came out of France both figuratively and literally, spending all but
a couple of years of his mature career in Rome, simply confirms his European
reputation and influence. For he united within a single oeuvre the warmer,
more sensuous and instinctive Italian tradition with the cooler, more
cerebral tradition of the north. He also set the programme for the
development of neo-classicism that ran on through David and Ingres and has
continued in constructivist and analytical practice and tradition, from
Cezanne and Mondrian to the minimalism of our own times.
Indeed the problem with Poussin, if problem it be, has largely been a
function of his acknowledged importance and the general seriousness in which
he is held. 'Signor Poussin', said Bernini tapping his forehead, 'is a
painter who works up here.' Such respect is all very well, but it is
inclined to get in the way of the work itself.
The scholars of art have a field day with Poussin, loving him for the
recondite complexities of his references, and absorbed by the problems of
attribution and chronological development he sets them. As for the artists,
to them Poussin is the supreme organiser and constructor of the image, the
supreme analyser and integrator of form and space, the supreme controller of
tone and colour.
There is to his work a simple authority, assured and inevitable, that quite
takes the breath away. How calm it all is, how exactly right in every
gesture and expression, how entirely free of fudge and hurry and histrionic.
All is worked out, definitive in its presence, ideal in its essence, artless
in its apparent simplicity and completeness, yet so full of art. No wonder
that Cezanne was moved to say, two centuries on, that his only wish was 'to
do Poussin again, but from Nature', as though to suppose in all sincerity
that Poussin had taken nothing from the real world, had made it all up.
The thrill of the magnificent and comprehensive review of Poussin, now on in
Paris, is that while it gives us these two views of this great master's work
exactly - the scholar's and the artist's to both their hearts' content - it
goes far beyond each limited response to give us the whole artist. Here he
is, cerebral and technical to be sure, but also free and experimental,
sensuous and intuitive, and full of wit.
The drawings are an especial interest and pleasure and, quite rightly, are
given due prominence - though I would question the wisdom of showing such
naturally dense and absorbing material en bloc, most of all the early
drawings that fill the first room, for they inevitably create a traffic jam
of visitors at the very outset of the show. That said, they are not to be
missed, for they are not only extremely rare, delicate and beautiful things
but they offer a peculiar insight into Poussin's working methods.
Here, lightly and freely stated, we see the first intuitive registering of
his pictorial ideas, with each then radically simplified, almost to modern
eyes to the point of abstraction - shades of Cezanne, Picasso, Bomberg - by
the application of a stark chiaroscuro wash for the shadows. Thus are the
essential structure and dynamic of each composition established, here a
battle, here a bacchanale, reduced to a set of vigorous directional strokes.
The paintings take us through the full range of the work, from the earliest
mythologies and history paintings before the migration to Rome, to the
mysterious and elegiac landscapes with cities and figures of the later
years. Poussin had stopped at Venice for a period on his way to Rome, and
the influence of the idealised arcadian vision of such as Bellini, Giorgione
and the young Titian is clear enough. So much is known and recognised, but
always rather in the letter than the spirit. Here it is the evident
sensuousness of Poussin himself, Venetian perhaps in origin but transformed
by his own clear purposes and intellect, that comes as the glorious
surprise.
So much for the stoical Poussin, looking rather to the classical than to the
Christian model for his austere moralities - yet how lightly his nymphs and
goddesses flirt and turn, or stretch and dream beneath the trees. And how
beautifully seen they are, and so lovingly drawn and painted. The two great
sequences of the sacraments are shown complete, and in the earlier 'Extreme
Unction', from Belvoir Castle, the dying man lies surrounded and urgently
attended on the bed. Alone to the right, the pretty serving-maid slips out
to fetch more wine, turning to smile at us as she goes. Life goes on.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: Aurelie, My Sister - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Incest may be rife in Quebec: even if it isn't, it is taken remarkably
calmly when it occurs and can be beneficial to family relationships, or so
we learn from the new production at The Gate.
Aurelie, My Sister, by the prolific French Canadian, Marie Laberge, is
beautifully acted, meticulously directed and has one of the most lovingly
detailed sets ever seen in this theatre. It is also very well written. But
it is not much of a drama.
The plot is complex and tends to unfold backwards. There are only two
characters: the 45-year-old Aurelie and the near 25-year-old Cat, who could
be her daughter. Their relationship is close and friendly. Cat is having an
intensely physical affair with a married man whom she hopes will leave his
wife. She tells Aurelie all about it. In what seems a fairly banal
development the man decides to spend more time with his family.
Yet this is only a teasing, though longish, start: almost a decoy, just as
Hitchcock and Truffaut have been mentioned in the early dialogue. Cat is not
Aurelie's daughter: she is her young sister. She was conceived by their
father in a fit of incest with Aurelie's other sister, Charlotte. The latter
has packed her bags and gone off to sculpt in Italy, leaving Cat in
Aurelie's care.
Most of this comes out about half way through when Cat and Aurelie return
from the father's funeral in small town Quebec.
If the play has a coherent theme, it is that life in French Canada can be
petty and bigoted, but that human relationships can survive in unexpected
forms. Aurelie, who is divorced, says that she was brought up with a terror
of God and sex. She declares herself a pagan like her father, but adds that
'in this neck of the woods, you don't have to be a Catholic to have all the
symptoms'.
Nevertheless, Quebec seems reasonably affluent. Aurelie and Cat are seldom
less than well dressed and the friendship between them is civilised - closer
perhaps than between a real mother and daughter. One can just about read
into the text a political allegory: either French and English-speaking
Canada should stick together despite their differences, or that Quebec
should get on with the separation.
The flaw is the absence of action. Aurelie, My Sister is a peculiarly
passive play. It might be better as a novel: certainly it has possibilities
as a movie where the camera could range to scenes which are here only
referred to in the dialogue.
Given the text as it is, however, nothing can detract from the performances
of Sheila Reid as Aurelie and Carol Starks as Cat. Both have a quiet
dignity, even beauty: neither has much of a chip, despite the circumstances.
The set, full of old books, rag dolls and all the paraphernalia of half a
life-time, is Aurelie's conservatory, plants and vegetables to the fore. She
seems content to be there, and so does Cat.
Laurence Boswell directs. I do not wholly like the technique of pulling a
semi-transparent curtain round the stage between scenes, especially when
nothing much is changed, but it does have the effect of suggesting a kind of
therapy. There are characters who need to be treated carefully, wrapped and
unwrapped: otherwise they might go mad.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Arts: An enlightened 'Euryanthe' - Opera in concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We are in debt to the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the South
Bank's 'associate orchestra', for many enlightening performances. On Sunday,
however, Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe came up like a revelation:
who would have believed that it could be so stirring? Happily, the Queen
Elizabeth Hall was packed out with the OAE's devoted audience - but it is a
thousand pities that Euryanthe is not running for two or three evenings
more. The 'Deutsche Romantik' series will be lucky to strike gold again with
such eclat.
Euryanthe came two years after Weber's Der Freischutz, and less than three
before his Oberon for London and his untimely death here (he was not yet
40). Unlike the popular folk-tale Freischutz it has an old-fashioned
chivalric plot, generally agreed to exceed the limits of preposterousness.
(The story is so batty that even the programme was muddled about just whose
suicidal sister's ghost needed laying.) That said, Weber set about animating
every moment with direct, passionate feeling and a wealth of original
resource.
That was what we heard on Sunday: not just a performance that was often
thrilling, but a proclamation that Euryanthe really is a magnificent
operatic score. Everyone who collaborated in it was on peak form. A special
mention is due to the bass-baritone Nicholas Folwell, who had learned the
role of the villainous Lysiart at very short notice, and delivered it with
grim confidence and a torrent of lustily rolled 'r's.
The hapless heroine herself was Christine Brewer, who explored the
surprising range and depth of her part with exquisite sensitivity. Nicely
matched against her, Elizabeth Connell lent her familiar, formidable powers
to the wicked Eglantine. Jon Garrison was a stylish hero, Adolar; in the
lesser role of the King, young Nathan Berg's beautiful baritone reminded us
that he is a star in the making; and in faceless small parts Elizabeth
Woollett and Timothy Robinson made positive marks.
The hero of the evening was nevertheless Mark Elder, conducting the OAE with
tireless energy and imagination. Not only the main numbers, but all the
fluid 'recitatives' - misleadingly so called, for scarcely any of them are
mere declamation over chords: Weber - and Elder - shaped them lovingly,
instilling them with moment-to-moment drama and dressing them often in
unheard-of orchestral colours.
In all that, the OAE's 'original'-style instruments came superbly into their
own. Wonderful vox humana bassoons, dewy flutes, a clattery hubbub of horns,
trombones with a hoarse, rousing blat that never domineer over the tutti
sound. Perhaps half the problem with Euryanthe in this century has been that
Weber understood his own instruments so perfectly, and deployed them so
brilliantly, that modern playing-machines can never do him more than dusty
justice.

FT  18 OCT 94 / People: HSBC consolidates control over Midland Bank
management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Geoghegan, 41, who joined the predecessor of HSBC Holdings over 20
years ago and is senior vice-president of its US operations, is taking over
from Michael Smith, 38, as head of Midland Bank's international operations.
Smith, managing director of Midland's international business for the past
couple of years, becomes deputy chief executive of Hongkong Bank Malaysia
Berhard, with effect from November 28.
Midland Bank was taken over by HSBC Holdings just over two years ago. The
Hongkong Bank has since moved its own people into top positions at Midland.
Keith Whitson, with the Hongkong Bank since he left school, took over as
Midland's chief executive at the end of March. His deputy, chief financial
officer, head of human resources and Midland's head of credit and risk have
all been drafted in from the Hongkong Bank.
A couple of months ago Christopher Sheridan, 51, quit as chief executive of
Midland's Samuel Montagu after ten years in the post. Sheridan, who joined
Montagu in 1962, has been replaced by Keith Harris, a former Morgan Grenfell
and Drexel Burnham Lambert merchant banker who was managing director of the
corporate finance arm of Apax Partners, the venture capital group.
Roger Downham, 50, director of Midland Bank Property Services, recently left
to join Leslie Clark &amp; Partners as managing director of Leslie Clark Project
Services. His place has been taken by John Breen, head of group property at
HSBC.
The Hongkong Bank has also extended control over management of Midland's
overseas subsidiaries. David Dew, 38, a senior manager with the British Bank
of the Middle East, has become chief executive of Midland Bank, Italy. John
Wheeler, 47, senior manager international corporate accounts at Hongkong
Bank, takes over as chief executive of Midland Bank, Spain; his post goes to
Alan Keir, 35, Midland's head of consumer industries.

FT  18 OCT 94 / People: O'Shea moves up at Halma group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen O'Shea has been appointed to the new post of deputy chief executive
at Halma Group, the fast-growing safety and environmental technology
concern.
The promotion of O'Shea, 48, below, is designed to give more 'central
horsepower' according to David Barber, who remains chairman and chief
executive. Over the past two years, the number of companies within Halma has
grown from 30 to about 45.
The appointment suggests the beginnings of a succession policy. Barber, 62,
chairman since 1973, said no further changes are planned in the short-term
but added that O'Shea, in his new position, was clearly 'the favourite
candidate' to replace him.
Barber has turned Halma into one of the UK's most successful specialist
engineering companies, with subsidiaries in environmental control, fire
detection, gas detection, safety and security. In June, it announced a 20
per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 25.1m.
O'Shea was previously Halma's divisional chief executive responsible for
both the fire detection and gas detection divisions; he will have overall
responsibility for these businesses and the security division.
He is replaced by Neil Quinn and Ralph Jessop at fire detection and gas
detection respectively.

Ivory &amp; Sime, the quoted Edinburgh-based fund management group, is getting a
new managing director.
Allan Munro, who has held the job since 1991, is stepping down and being
replaced by Colin Hook, 52, who joins from Caledonia Investments, the
holding company controlled by the Cayzer family which took a 29.9 per cent
stake in I&amp;S in July.
David Newbigging, chairman, said Munro had told him earlier this year he
wished to step down to concentrate on his speciality, managing fixed
interest portfolios.
Munro was a member of the management committee which took over the running
of I&amp;S in 1990 after the previous managing director David Ross and four
senior fund managers abruptly left.
Hook was founding managing director and shareholder of J Rothschild
Charterhouse Management and Global Asset Management (Asia), two Asian fund
management businesses in Hong Kong.
His appointment is cautiously welcomed in Edinburgh investment management
circles. 'Probably the first md I&amp;S have ever had from outside the company.
He could be a new broom,' one observer said yesterday.

FT  18 OCT 94 / People: BZW's new deputy chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The heir appparent to David Band at the helm of BZW, Barclays' investment
banking arm, emerged yesterday with the appointment of Donald Brydon,
chairman and chief executive of BZW Asset Management, as BZW deputy chief
executive.
Brydon, right, who has been responsible for growing funds under management
at BZW Asset Management to Pounds 50bn and spreading its international
activities, takes over from John Spencer, who will be leaving BZW at the end
of the year.
Although Band is expected to remain chief executive for at least two years,
Brydon's appointment completes the reshuffle of senior management at BZW
intended to prepare for a new generation of leadership in the second half of
the decade.
Unlike Spencer, who combined the role of deputy chief executive with being
head of BZW's markets division, Brydon will give up his line management
responsibilities to work alongside Band heading BZW's management committee.
He will be succeeded as BZWAM chief executive by Lindsay Tomlinson, the
current deputy chief executive.
Brydon will be non-executive chairman of BZWAM, and will also join the group
executive committee which runs the Barclays group.
Band, who has been chief executive of BZW since 1988 and has been at the
helm during a period of rapid growth and diversificaction, may succeed Sir
Peter Middleton as chairman of BZW when he gives up the chief executive
post.
Brydon, who is 49, said that the firm's growth meant that 'a more complex
style of management' was required.
Brydon took over at BZAM in 1991. He has a mathematics degree and helped to
introduce quantitative techniques there, but is modest about his skills. 'I
wouldn't describe myself as a mathematician. I am numerate maybe,' he says.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: On time and to order / A look at Compaq's
upgrade of its Scottish computer plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compaq Computer's plant at Erskine in Scotland is just a few miles from the
village of Houston, a coincidence that symbolises its connection with the
company's headquarters in Houston, Texas.
Until recently Compaq's Scottish manufacturing operations have largely
focused on assembling technology developed in the US. However, Erskine's
role is being upgraded as part of the company's worldwide review of
manufacturing efficiency, started four months ago in a bid to become the
personal computer world market leader by 1996.
Already, Compaq is well on the way to achieving its goal. The company
doubled its profits in the first half of this year. It has also continued to
cut the prices of its PCs, which have stolen a lead from IBM and Apple
Computer in terms of unit sales in the US and Europe for the first half of
this year. Third-quarter results are due tomorrow.
George Devlin, managing director at Erskine, has led the project team
examining the company's manufacturing and delivery operation, nicknamed
'make and move'.
However, he acknowledges that shortcomings have recently emerged across the
company's plants in producing its Elite line of notebook computers.
'We couldn't get some new products to our customers in the quantities they
wanted, at the time they wanted them,' he says. This, he observes, was due
to 'design issues' and 'supply issues'.
The rethinking of the company's processes from manufacturing to delivery has
now gone through what Devlin calls its diagnosis phase, ending last week
with a presentation in Houston to Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president and
chief executive. Compaq plants are now implementing the conclusions of the
review.
Compaq has been transformed since Pfeiffer was appointed in late 1991.
Between November 1991 and November 1993 Compaq quadrupled its global output
volume, producing cheaper PCs, without increasing the manufacturing space of
its core factories at Houston, Singapore and Erskine.
This year it has opened plants in Brazil and China.
The 540,000 sq ft Erskine plant outside Glasgow, which supplies 80 per cent
of Compaq's European, Middle East and Africa market, had to make changes in
manufacturing systems, some of which are now being adopted across the
company.
'We used to think of ourselves as a high volume manufacturer,' says Devlin.
'In reality we've become one only recently.' Erskine's output increased two
and half times between 1991 and 1993, while unit production costs fell by 76
per cent. There has been a further 60 per cent rise in output volume over
the past 12 months.
Greg Petsch, senior vice-president in Houston for corporate operations, set
the Erskine plant the target of cutting costs to the level of the Singapore
plant, which has the advantages of more component suppliers located nearby
and lower labour costs. If it succeeded it would earn the right, enjoyed by
Singapore, to manufacture its own mother boards - a printed circuit board
which includes the microprocessor and other tiny components, and are at the
value added end of making PCs - and to produce notebook computers.
First, Erskine's PC assembly area abandoned progressive production lines and
moved to a station build system - instead of a moving production line, one
person assembles most of the central processing unit at one station. Ken
McQuade, manufacturing manager, says this gives workers more satisfaction
because they partially finish a product.
Erskine then introduced a cell build system alongside station build and now
uses it for 40 per cent of its output. Workers in cells of five operate as a
team, carrying out all the jobs of PC assembly to boxed product ready for
the customer.
This enables PC testing and software installation to be carried out in one
place, cuts out travel round the plant and releases valuable space. There
are manpower savings as all members of the cell can be continuously
occupied.
Partly because of successful cost-reductions at Erskine, Compaq has
installed five new production lines using surface mount technology (SMT) to
produce the PC's mother board. The first line began operating in July. A
month earlier Erskine began production of its notebook products.
By the end of the year Erskine will have invested Pounds 17m in SMT lines,
producing 40 per cent of its boards in-house. It has taken on 250 extra
staff, taking total numbers to around 1,100, in addition to which there are
up to 500 temporary staff.
To justify the capital cost of the new lines the Erskine plant has begun
working 24 hours a day seven days a week. Devlin says the new production
processes at the plant 'collapse part of the supply chain'.
The remaining boards will continue to be imported from Compaq in Singapore
with some supplied by PCB assemblers nearby in Scotland. By 1997 Erskine
hopes to make all its mother boards in-house.
Devlin admits that the Scottish plant has less control over its supply chain
than Houston or Singapore, but says 50-60 per cent of its components are
delivered on a daily, just-in-time basis. Most sheet metal products come
from Fullarton at Irvine, Ayrshire, and disc drives from Quantum in Ireland
as well as Conner at Irvine.
But the flat-panel displays for the company's notebook still have to be
imported by sea from Japan, requiring a 24-week ordering lead time.
'Scotland should get someone to invest in a Dollars 1bn plant making
displays and monitors,' he says.
As the plant moves towards PC production to order, a short supply chain is
essential and would complement its improved manufacturing efficiency. 'We
want to move the company from being a 'push' organisation in which we
determine what we build and you the customer use it, to becoming a 'pull'
organisation in which we build what the customers tell us they want,' he
says.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: Driving at new speeds - Robert Patton considers
a new concept in CD-Rom drives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PATTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matsushita's new CD-Rom drive, unveiled in Tokyo this month, could provide
the company with a specialised niche in the multimedia market.
The latest drive enables users to transfer data from CD-Rom to another disc,
edit the data, and read it at roughly the same speed as from the CD-Rom. It
is the nearest the industry has come to creating recordability in the CD-Rom
format.
The drive will read conventional CD-Rom discs at quadruple speed and allows
the user to write, erase and rewrite up to 650 megabytes of data onto
optical discs. The drive uses a 'phase-change' recording technique, which
reversibly alters the structure of the disc.
Matsushita is not the first to produce such a dual-purpose drive. This
February, Sony introduced the MD (MiniDisc) data drive, an offshoot of the
MiniDisc audio format which also combines read-write and read-only
technology in the same drive. But where the MiniDisc has yet to develop its
market, CD-Rom has become an essential part of every computer system that
aspires to the 'multimedia' catch word.
When Sony's MiniDisc format was being developed, recordability was an
essential part of the concept. According to Andrew House, a Sony spokesman:
'We never thought that write once was a really effective alternative.'
The field of audio, video and data recording is strewn with the bones of
formats that died because they did not allow consumers to make their own
recordings. The compact disc is the only recording medium since the LP
record that has achieved broad market success without offering
recordability. That shortcoming is the principal reason for the continued
market success of the audio cassette.
With recording media for computer applications, the ability to rewrite data
is even more vital. This makes the success of CD-Rom as a medium of
distribution and storage for computer data remarkable. But CD-Rom arrived at
a time when there were no better alternatives. The market needed a means of
distributing large quantities of graphical data to users. Hard disc drives
of comparable size were expensive. Some drives could handle removable media,
but the capacity of a CD-Rom disc was 5-10 times that of a removable hard
disc.
A rewritable CD-Rom drive is technically impossible at the moment. The
process of recording data on a CD involves burning microscopic pits into the
surface and the process is not reversible.
But there are other optical disc recording methods which combine the
capacity of the CD with the advantage of recordability.
Magneto-optical (MO) recording uses a laser beam to change the magnetic
state of the recording surface using a technique called Kerr-rotation. The
changes are read magnetically during playback.
Most optical disc drives for personal computer applications use
magneto-optical technology. Governed by an international ISO standard, MO
drives are now available with capacities of 230 MB per 3.5-inch disc and are
expected to surpass 600 MB by 1996. Magneto-optical is also the technique
Sony uses in MiniDisc and MD Data recorders.
A second optical recording technique, shown by Matsushita at the Japan
electronics show, uses the laser beam's heat to change the phase of
structure of the recording surface from an amorphous state to crystalline
and back again. It is this ability to change structure and reverse that is
the basis of the rewritable CD-Rom/optical drive.
It is likely that when CD-Rom/phase-change drives appear in the shops next
year, they will be the only game in town for those who want to read
pre-recorded software and multimedia data CDs in a drive that can both read
and write the same amount of data at the same speed. The only alternatives
available now involve two drives, a conventional CD-Rom combined with a 650+
MB hard disc drive or one of a few very expensive optical recorders
currently produced for commercial and industrial applications.
But in a year or two, next generation magneto-optical drives are likely to
reach the capacity of a CD. Matsushita hopes that by then its CD-Rom/phase
change drive, which uses discs of 120mm diameter, will have carved out its
own specialised niche in the market. In addition, CD-Rom drives might be
used side-by-side with high-capacity magneto-optical drives.
One thing is certain: the market wants high-capacity, high-speed, rewritable
media. One way or another, the market will get it. By November, Matsushita
will be shipping samples of their CD-Rom/phase-change drive priced at
Y100,000 (Pounds 633) and some time next year, volume shipments will begin.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Technology: Factory cranes get smart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Factory cranes have long been taken for granted by industrial users, but the
drive for increased productivity is prompting customers to seek more
sophisticated solutions for their handling needs. Enter, the thinking crane.
The trend towards more efficient stock control, smaller warehouses and
just-in-time production, calls for faster, more productive and safer cranes,
which, in turn, requires sophisticated controls of electric motors.
In March, Cheshire-based Street Crane, one of the market leaders for
electric overhead travelling cranes, responded by beginning Hoist 2000, a
Pounds 500,000 project to develop the use of programmable logic controllers
in hoists.
The aim is to develop programmable speed control for cranes, incorporating
changes of speed to accelerate the movement of components around a factory
or distribution centre without compromising on safety.
For the first time, Street has won support for its technology development
from the Department of Trade and Industry, which is funding the most
innovative parts of the project with Pounds 300,000.
In its most developed form, the Hoist 2000 will incorporate in-built
condition monitoring to record cycles of operation and events such as
overloading. This will allow users to undertake planned maintenance, detect
abuse of the crane and monitor safety of operation.
The project is still under development, but Street is already selling cranes
incorporating another PLC-based initiative called Smart Options. This
embraces two developments, SC. Smartlift and SC. Smartdrive, which enable
the crane's horizontal and vertical motions to be pre-programmed. SC.
Smartlift monitors the speed 25 times per second.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Accountants need to be 'proactive' -
Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Accountants need to be more proactive in the services they provide to
lawyers. This is the finding of a survey of law firms by accountants Baker
Tilley and The Lawyer magazine.
Lawyers do not rate the financial advice they receive from accountants very
highly, with only 43 per cent of respondents considering it to be good or
excellent. A number of firms said accountancy documents were too technical
and should be simpler and more precise.
Lawyers are also unhappy at the level of fees charged by accountants. More
than 30 per cent of respondents thought these were high or very high.
According to Baker Tilley, this is 'a surprisingly high statistic from a
profession which operates a similar fee structure'.

The Centre for Dispute Resolution (CEDR), an industry-backed,
non-profit-making body set up in 1990 to promote the use of alternative
dispute resolution in the UK, has resolved a Pounds 3m dispute between
Hawker Siddeley Power Engineering and the Ceylon Electricity Board.
The two-year-old dispute, over an electrical engineering contract for
Colombo's underground distribution system, was resolved in five days.
CEDR was approached by the British High Commission after several
unsuccessful attempts by the parties to settle the wrangle. Mediation was
carried out in Sri Lanka by two mediators from London. The alternative for
the parties was lengthy international arbitration, according to CEDR. One of
the companies estimated its cost savings at Pounds 200,000.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Tetra Pak appeal - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, recently lost its appeal to the
Court of First Instance against a record Ecu75m (Pounds 58.8m) fine levied
by the European Commission for breach of the Rome Treaty competition rules.
The case, which involved a six-year investigation by the Commission followed
by a two-year administrative procedure, concerned the commercial policy
adopted by Tetra Pak in the European Community since 1976 in respect of its
packaging machines and cartons.
The Commission found Tetra Pak had a dominant position in the markets for
machines and cartons intended for the aseptic packaging of liquid foods in
the EC, and that it had abused that position both in those markets and in
the neighbouring markets for non-aseptic machines and cartons.
Non-aseptic food packaging does not require the same degree of sterility as
aseptic packaging and so calls for less sophisticated equipment.
Tetra Pak denied it was in a dominant position in the EC and that it had
infringed the competition rules.
First, it disputed the Commission's definitions of the product market and
geographical market. Second, it disputed that it was in a dominant position
in the markets for aseptic products. Finally, it disputed whether the
relevant EC competition rules applied to Tetra Pak's conduct in the
neighbouring markets for non-aseptic products, in which it was not dominant.
In defining the product market, the Court held that it was necessary to take
account of all the competitive conditions in the general market for the
packaging of liquid food products when determining whether the Commission
was correct in finding that there were distinct markets for aseptic and
non-aseptic machines and cartons.
The Commission was right to determine this issue on the basis of whether
other products were sufficiently interchangeable with the particular
markets, and to apply this test to the packaging systems themselves and not
to the finished products (for example, milk cartons).
Given this, the Court found, on the facts the Commission had established to
the requisite legal standards, that the markets for aseptic and non-aseptic
machines and cartons were distinct from the general market in systems for
packaging liquid food products.
With regard to the geographical market, the Court held that this consisted
of a territory in which all traders operated under the same conditions of
competition as far as the relevant products were concerned.
The Commission's definition of the market as covering the whole EC market
was thus correct, as demand was stable throughout the EC, customers could
obtain supplies in other member states and the products themselves could be
easily transported between member states.
With regard to dominance of the aseptic markets, the Court had little
difficulty supporting the Commission's findings, as these showed the
applicant had 90 per cent of the market in aseptic machines and cartons
throughout the EC.
With regard to the Commission's finding that Tetra Pak had abused its
dominant position in the neighbouring market of non-aseptic products, in
which it was not dominant, the Court said a company in a dominant position
had a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair genuine,
undistorted competition on the common market.
The actual scope of this special responsibility depended on the specific
circumstances of each case.
In the present case, both aseptic and non-aseptic products were used for
packaging the same liquid food products, and a substantial proportion of
Tetra Pak's customers operated in both areas.
Given these facts, the Court held that the Commission was entitled to find
that the links between the aseptic and non-aseptic markets reinforced the
applicant's economic power over those markets, without there being a need to
establish the existence of a dominant position on the non-aseptic markets.
Tetra Pak also claimed that its conduct was not abusive. The Court found,
among other things, that customer contracts which tied machine users to
using Tetra Pak's cartons were not objectively justified and were intended
to strengthen the company's dominant position by reinforcing its customers'
economic dependence on it.
The Court also found that the company's prices at certain times were below
variable costs and that this was evidence of predatory pricing, as no
dominant company had any interest in applying such prices except to
eliminate competitors.
A number of other procedural pleas raised by Tetra Pak, including
submissions on the level of the record fine, were dismissed.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Cause for quiet celebration - One year
after its launch, Robert Rice examines the progress of the UK's Financial
Law Panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As it approaches its first birthday, the UK's Financial Law Panel has good
cause for cheer. The panel was set up by the Bank of England amid concern
that uncertainties in the law affecting financial markets were undermining
London's future as an international financial centre.
Today, the FLP enjoys the active support of some 150 (fee paying) law firms,
banks and other financial institutions. And according to the FLP's chairman,
Lord Donaldson, former Master of the Rolls: 'In its first year, the panel
has made far greater progress with its allotted task than could reasonably
have been expected.'
To date, nine projects have been completed. In addition to guidance papers
on so-called 'netting' (off-setting liablities between two parties), the FLP
has produced papers on the legal position of 'shadow' directors (people who,
while not directors themselves, exercise control over the management of a
company); the controversial issue of brokers' liability for premium in
non-marine insurance at Lloyds; and a recommendation on the position banks
should adopt on security over cash deposits.
Lord Alexander QC, chairman of National Westminster Bank and the Bank of
England's legal risks review committee, which recommended setting up the
FLP, said 'I feel the prototype is flying.' When, two years ago, the
committee recommended the FLP the idea seemed a good one, he said. But there
were several concerns. Would there be enough subscribers? Would there be
enough for the panel to do in the long term? Would enough people want to
solve problems outside court to make the panel worthwhile?
Those concerns have proved largely unfounded. 'Overall, I'm rather
encouraged,' said Lord Alexander.
According to Lord Alexander, NatWest is satisfied it is getting value for
money. He points to the reassurance the panel has provided for the markets
in general, particularly in areas such as netting and shadow directorships,
where although bankers and lawyers felt they were on solid legal ground
there was still some uncertainty.
The panel has also been able to prevent disputes going to court by examining
issues such as the Lloyd's brokers' liability. The panel sought to determine
whether an industry practice existed by which brokers could be held liable
for premiums. It found no such custom existed and the issue has now been
resolved without recourse to the courts. 'That seems to me like a very
attractive way of dealing with issues,' said Lord Alexander.
He believes the panel's greatest strength is that it is seen as impartial -
a view echoed by Mr Colin Bamford, the FLP's chief executive. Although Mr
Bamford concedes that 'sometimes what we do makes people's lives more
difficult', his main objective of ensuring the FLP is seen as independent
appears to have been achieved.
'There is no point in the panel being the representative voice of City
solicitors or another arm of the Bank of England,' he said.
This question of independence is particularly important when dealing with
the government. 'My perception is that the government regards us as worth
listening to because we are not a representative body of City interests.
There is enough special pleading on behalf of interest groups already,' he
said.
One consequence of this uncompromising stance is that several banks which
have turned to the FLP have been frustrated at its dogged impartiality.
The debate on the limits of auditors' liability is an example of an issue in
which the FLP has resisted any involvement. 'It's an important debate. But
there are no legal uncertainties involved. We would just be adding our voice
to one side or another and that's not what we're here for,' says Mr Bamford.
As it sets out on its second 12 months, the panel's agenda is already full.
The two big projects on its hands are legal uncertainties in fund management
 -an issue brought to the FLP by UK commercial banks - and the powers of
public bodies, such as local authorities and National Health Service Trusts,
to deal in financial markets. The latter is a legacy of the 1990 Hammersmith
and Fulham council 'interest rate swaps' case in which the Law Lords ruled
that swaps contracts between banks and local authorities were invalid
because local authorities were not empowered to carry out such transactions.
The issue of public bodies trading in financial markets has been given added
importance by two recent developments: a High Court ruling in May in the
Allerdale case; and by the government's much-vaunted private finance
initiative for public sector projects.
In the Allerdale case, the High Court ruled that Credit Suisse, a Swiss
bank, could not recover a Pounds 5m loan to Allerdale Borough Council,
Cumbria, which the local authority had guaranteed. The court said the
council did not have the power to issue a guarantee. The judgment heightened
concern in the City about lending to local authorities.
Since the Hammersmith and Fulham ruling local authorities have been lobbying
the government for a change in the law on the public bodies' powers to
engage in City trading. Local authorities have proposed two solutions:
either abolish the ultra vires rule (which provides that a contract is void
and unenforceable if it is beyond the powers of a public body); or introduce
'safe harbour' provisions for banks entering into such transactions.
Neither solution is attractive to the government. The FLP was called in and
has proposed to the Treasury that a tribunal be set up under the Audit
Commission to which public bodies can take pre-clearance for proposed City
deals. If the proposed tribunal says a deal is within a public body's powers
it will issue a certificate as a safeguard for third parties. It is a novel
solution, says Lord Alexander, which only an independent body such as the
panel could have proposed.
Over the coming months the panel will also be continuing two long-term
projects - seminars for judges on practical developments in the financial
markets, and the development of the idea of the panel acting as amicus
curiae - friend of the court - in litigation involving the operation of the
financial markets.
The latter has already been discussed with senior judges and lawyers and is
generally well received, said Mr Bamford.

Around Derbyshire's coalfields in the north of England there is widespread
mistrust of anyone who says that improving productivity will make jobs more
secure. The closure of pits shortly after British Coal exhorted employees to
higher productivity left many understandably cynical.
Local feelings were therefore running high three years ago when new
management at Plyglass, a glass processor in Somercotes, Derbyshire,
attempted to rebuild the basis on which its 460-strong workforce was paid.
The company, which makes tempered and laminated glass, sealed double glazing
units and PVCU windows for the construction industry, was typical of many
long-established companies.
Industrial relations were characterised by management and labour simply
co-existing with little sense of common purpose in an atmosphere of mistrust
and hostility.
Plyglass's efforts to break with the 'them and us' attitude and improve
productivity will be familiar with many other companies trying to alter
working practices. Its experience underlines the difficulty of changing
deeply entrenched attitudes.
When Alan Twaite arrived at Plyglass as managing director three years ago,
he says, it was clear that company interests were not uppermost in the minds
of many in the workforce.
He says less than 10 per cent of the workforce at its four sites could be
described as 'caring' and willing to learn how to improve the business. A
smaller minority were firmly rooted in the 'stuff it' camp. But the vast
majority of employees were sitting on the fence, undecided which side of the
traditional divide they were on.
'There was this feeling that if everyone was standing to attention the
management was in control,' says Twaite.
'In fact, Plyglass was paying the highest wages in the area but it was bad
value for money,' he adds.
The business was also in financial difficulty. Like many larger companies,
the parent of Plyglass, family-owned Greenbrook Industries, had gone on an
acquisition spree in the 1980s that proved unsuccessful.
Plyglass was on the way to making pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.4m on sales of
Pounds 17m in the year to June 1993 and was threatening the health of the
whole group.
Twaite quickly sold or closed the Scottish, Welsh and Hampshire companies.
But he believed the big obstacle to further progress was working practices.
'The productivity issue was important, to solve an attitude problem,' says
Twaite. But the company also needed the workforce on its side to reduce
waste of materials. Sixty per cent of manufacturing costs is accounted for
by materials compared with less than 10 per cent for labour costs.
'One does not address this issue with enforced disciplines,' Twaite says.
'You have to get the guys to treat the product with care.'
With the one remaining site at Somercotes, the management started looking at
the annual pay settlement.
Under long-established practice, the Glass and Glazing Federation and the
General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union would negotiate a basic rate that
accounted for about half average pay. The balance was negotiated in bonuses
at the factory.
Twaite says this system led to all sorts of anomalies. The bonus was partly
decided by time and motion studies of throughput on a particular machine.
Any breakages or work that required more work led to higher bonuses.
Furthermore, the system was geared to maximising output, not to meeting
demand from customers.
At the beginning of 1993 Twaite and production director Bob Taylor decided
to raise the basic pay to about 80 per cent of the average pay under the old
system. This would be enhanced under a new pooled bonus scheme.
The new scheme includes a productivity element; if departmental targets are
exceeded, the bonus pool is credited. Employees also work to quality
targets. This is based on a formula that looks at the amount of materials
waste, whether orders are delivered on time and the level of customer
returns. The bonus pool is then shared equally throughout the company.
Management's announcement of the plan, after months of trying to negotiate
its introduction, was greeted with a vote for strike action. But the strike
never happened - Taylor says because district union oficials realised the
company's customers would take their orders elsewhere, effectivly closing
the factory.
Eighteen months later, there has been progress but not unqualified success.
Output has increased by 16 per cent, while the wage bill is unchanged year
on year.
But there has been less consistent progress in reducing waste. 'I cannot
point to continuous improvement,' says Taylor though he claims Plyglass is
better placed to manage its reduction.
The response from the workforce has been mixed. Twaite says some old
attitudes die slowly. Some employees are only just beginning to understand
what the company is trying to do for its customers.
The management admits it also has much to learn, particularly about
communication. Employees complain they get little notice of the size of
their bonus payments or explanation why they vary.
'The main problem is that the workforce does not feel it can see the bad
months coming whereas in the old system they could tell what their pay would
be,' says Taylor.
The company has returned to profit with Pounds 620,000 from sales reduced to
Pounds 16m. But it believes it has only scratched the surface of possible
improvements.
It is working with consultants on a programme of continuous improvement
funded partly by the Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council. And it is
stepping up efforts to communicate better - a move Taylor says will pay off
as more employees try to isolate problems that have affected the bonus pool.
Whether this is enough to give Plyglass a future as a successful,
independent glass processor is uncertain, given the consolidation taking
place within the industry, says Twaite.
But its efforts so far have at least given it the opportunity to fight for
that future.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Learning to extend
quality - New aids are available to take companies beyond BS accreditation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies pursuing accreditation under BS EN ISO 9000 - what used to be BS
5750. - need to peer through a fog of marketing hype these days to find
those parts of the process that genuinely improve quality.
Different organisations are attempting this in different ways. The British
Standards Institution, the UK's largest quality assurance assessor, is about
to launch an ambitious teaching aid using CD-Rom technology.
The distance learning product, called Fastraq 9000, uses video, text and
sound in an interactive package to describe the methodology behind the
writing of a quality manual. Fastraq 9000 took two years to develop at a
project cost of Pounds 500,000. It will take an executive 16 hours to work
through properly, BSI says.
In complete contrast MRDL, a small Woking-based consultancy, is questioning
the way many companies have implemented quality programmes and is
introducing what it calls an alternative 'Minimalist Managing System'.
MRDL asserts that UK companies waste Pounds 45m a year writing and managing
inflexible and over-complex quality systems simply to comply with BS EN ISO
9000. Simplification of the process not only costs less, but is more likely
to produce a quality manual that will become a management tool, MRDL says.
But first, BSI's Fastraq 9000, which will be on sale from mid-November. BSI
has targeted the product at managers interested in gaining certification and
for company training purposes. According to Ram Mylvaganam, director of
marketing at BSI, the most committed managers can also use it as a tool to
help write a company's quality manual, thereby reducing the need for
external consultants.
BSI is doing its bit to dispel the idea that the BS EN ISO 9000 standard is
an end in itself. Accreditation, it says, 'is just the end of the
beginning'.
But for a CD-based product of such length, the material is surprisingly
difficult to dip into and needs to be systematically worked through from
start to finish.
The 10 modules are not cheap - Pounds 2,500 in total, excluding VAT, plus up
to Pounds 500 for an expansion board to handle the high quality video
pictures. Unfortunately, BSI has declined to say how many Fastraq 9000's it
hopes to sell - so much for outsiders being able to measure its performance
against objectives.
Minimalist takes a different approach. It attempts to strip the narrative
used to describe procedures in quality manuals. The English language, it
says, is wordy and imprecise and even when clearly written can spawn
confusion. Minimalist breaks down each crucial procedure in a business and
puts the actions required in a matrix.
Down one side of the matrix are the actions needed to perform marketing or
purchasing procedures, for example; across the top is a list of who is
responsible, the follow-up action required, and what other procedures depend
on the action elsewhere in the organisation.
One fan of the system is Black Horse Relocation Services, part of the Lloyds
Bank group, which sought BS EN ISO 9000 accreditation to maintain a
competitive edge. After scouring the market, Paul Bolton, general manager of
network services, said he saw the limitation of many quality management
systems. 'You can end up with volumes of documentation that hold the
building up but do not help to manage the business,' Bolton says.
MRDL provided the training for Black Horse to write its own manual using
Minimalist. By minimising documentation and using the simple tabular format,
Black Horse's staff were able to write their own quality system. This
involvement gave them 'ownership' of a manual that has since become a
working tool.
'We have noticed a lot of benefit in terms of departments that are more
aware of what each other department is doing,' says Bolton.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Guidance when late bills
pile up - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation to allow businesses a statutory right to interest on bills that
are paid late may still be a long way off in the UK. But the need to manage
cash flow remains as acute as ever for businesses, particularly when they
are growing rapidly.
To help understand and calculate the cost of unpaid invoices and improve
cash flow, Griffin Factors, the subsidiary of Midland Bank, has produced a
guide, Financing the Credit Gap.
The free guide contains an interactive disc and a booklet which help to
assess the business's financial position and make recommendations.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Call to end VAT
'money-go-round' - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Federation of Small Businesses yesterday called for a system of VAT-free
trading between companies dealing on credit terms.
The Federation says HM Customs and Excise collected Pounds 63bn in 1993, of
which Pounds 25bn was subsequently repaid to companies in a 'futile
money-go-round'.
Freeing such inter-company trading from VAT would relieve small companies of
much of the paper work required to avoid the stringent VAT penalty regime,
the Federation said in a submission to the Chancellor of the Exchequer ahead
of the November Budget.
Abolition of inter-company VAT would be the 'biggest clearance of red tape
within a system recognised by all small business surveys to be the biggest
cause of concern for this sector', the Federation said.
The idea is likely to be opposed by Customs and Excise, which has argued
that VAT-free trading would increase the risk of abuse. The Federation
claims Customs and Excise collects considerably more than it is due and pays
it back later, creating a cash flow benefit to the Exchequer at the expense
of UK commerce.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Blair at risk of revolt on defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair is battling to head off a revolt by leftwing Labour
backbenchers in the Commons tonight in the first vote on defence policy
since he became party leader.
A group of leftwing MPs is expected to vote against the entire defence
estimates - the government's projected funding for the defence department -
defying Mr Blair's call for Labour MPs to abstain.
In an attempt to avoid a split Mr Blair last night tabled a wide-ranging
amendment condemning the government for imposing piecemeal cuts and failing
to hold a comprehensive review of defence policy.
His amendment also deplores the effect of the cuts on areas dependent on
defence contracts, and presses for more effective economic assistance for
hard-hit regions.
But the amendment fails to call for defence spending to be cut to the
average level of other western European countries, nor does it seek the
scrapping of the Trident missile system - as demanded by last week's Labour
conference.
This demand has again been backed by a group of prominent leftwing
backbenchers. They have tabled their own amendment to the government motion
seeking approval for the defence estimates.
If, in accordance with precedent, they are denied an opportunity to vote for
the amendment they will argue that voting against the entire estimate is the
only effective way of backing the decision taken by the conference.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, predicted yesterday that Mr Blair
would not be able to prevent another open split on defence policy.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Ending C4 funding 'safety net' ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday ruled out early legislation to scrap the funding
safety net for Channel 4, which says the formula could could cost it Pounds
500m over 10 years.
Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, and Mr Michael Grade, chief
executive, were left in little doubt yesterday after a meeting with Mr
Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, that legislation in the next
parliamentary session was virtually out of the question.
Under complex funding rules in the 1990 Broadcasting Act a safety net was
created to protect the minority remit of Channel 4 when it started selling
its own advertising time. Sir Michael has called the formula a 'golden-goose
windfall' for ITV.
The act requires all Channel 4 revenue above 14 per cent of total
non-satellite television advertising to be divided. Half goes to ITV, a
quarter is kept by Channel 4 and the last quarter goes into a reserve fund.
If revenue falls below 14 per cent Channel 4 is compensated from the reserve
fund and ITV companies down to a floor of 12 per cent.
Mr Dorrell yesterday refused to back a private member's bill to change the
formula, under which Channel 4 last year paid Pounds 38.2m to ITV. This
year's figure is expected to be Pounds 50m.
A formal review of the funding mechanism in 1997 is provided for under the
act and the issue could easily be shelved until then.
The meeting coincided with the publication of a pamphlet by the Bow Group,
the Tory think tank.
In the pamphlet Sir David Knox, Conservative MP for Staffordshire Moorlands,
warns that Channel 4's success is threatened by the formula. He says the
safety net is the single biggest hindrance to reinvestment in new
programmes.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Union against sell-off of division of UK Atomic Energy
Authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale of a division of the UK Atomic Energy Authority has run into strong
opposition from unions, which last night threatened industrial action unless
staff concerns were met, Alison Maitland writes.
The authority announces today that it is inviting bids for its Facilities
Services Division, which provides engineering, maintenance, security and
other services for its six sites.
The sale is part of the restructuring of the authority. Its nuclear
installations are to remain in public hands, but technology and consultancy
services are due to be privatised as AEA Technology. The authority wants to
sell the services division separately.
The IPMS specialists civil-service union, which represents 200 managers,
engineers and technicians employed by the authority, said 92 per cent had
opposed the sale in a ballot in which 73 per cent had voted.
Mr John Billard, national officer, said the authority had refused to show it
the memorandum of sale and was allowing it to consult with the preferred
bidder on terms and conditions only after the exchange of contracts.
He said: 'UKAEA have drawn up a new pension scheme which will abandon
index-linking and will freeze increases at 5 per cent a year.'
Coopers and Lybrand, financial advisers on the sale, said the authority
would sell only to a business prepared to preserve terms and conditions.

FT  18 OCT 94 / ITV to pitch for lottery ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV is seriously considering its own 'unofficial' National Lottery programme
to counter the official live draw on BBC 1 every Saturday evening.
The ITV network is saying nothing about its plans other than to insist that
its viewers will be kept fully informed about the National Lottery that will
start creating millionaires from November 19.
ITV could simply scroll the winning numbers across the bottom of the screen
while sticking to its existing schedule. But it is thought probable that ITV
will put on a matching lottery-related programme.
The signs that ITV intends to be competitive on what could be one of the
top-rated programmes on British television came yesterday as Camelot, the
National Lottery operator, and the BBC confirmed that they had signed a
three-year contract.
The BBC gave few details of the content of the programme but it did reveal
the names of the regular presenters who will take over after the initial
'extravaganza' to be hosted by Noel Edmonds. They will be Anthea Turner, a
presenter on GMTV, the commercial breakfast station, and Gordon Kennedy, the
comic actor.
After the opening draw the programme will be broadcast from venues all over
the country.
Mr Alan Yentob, controller of BBC 1, said yesterday he was not worried about
a potential response from ITV.
Mr Yentob said: 'This is the event, the real thing, and most people will
want to watch that.'
The lottery result will also be carried live on BBC Radio 1.
The BBC will announce today details of a competition to find a member of the
public to be the first person to press the button to start the machine that
will draw the winning six numbers.
The Pounds 1 tickets go on sale on November 14. If Camelot's forecasts are
met, the lottery should have revenues of Pounds 32bn over seven years and
raise a total of Pounds 9bn for the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the
national heritage and sport.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Atomic weapons plant safety standards attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Safety standards at the Atomic Weapons authority were criticised yesterday
by the government's Health and Safety Executive.
A 16-strong team of inspectors highlighted 65 areas of concern about safety
at four sites, with 19 points identified as priorities.
The group's review of health and management arrangements at Aldermaston,
Burghfield, Cardiff and Foulness was announced in May last year.
The inspectors called on Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, to remove
the establishment's immunity from licensing. They said that doing so would
provide additional controls.
The Ministry of Defence, which brought in Hunting-BRAE as management
contractors to run the sites last year, said it would examine this closely.
It accepted all the other recommendations.
However, Mr John Rimington, the health and safety group's director-general,
said: 'I must make clear our judgment, for the time being, that parts of the
plant most critical to safety are adequately safe by the standards we apply
to hazardous plant. The team found much to praise both in the attitudes and
actions of the management.'
The 19 priority areas include:
Production of an up-to-date instruction for the system which prevents
high-radiation events.
Facilities for the examination of drummed intermediate-level waste and a
waste-management strategy.
Work is already under way on the 19 main points, and the establishment must
respond within 12 months to the other 46 recommendations.

The Health and Safety Executive launched a campaign yesterday to cut the
Pounds 1.25bn a year cost to industry of strain injuries at work.
The body said that than 1m people a year were affected by injury, leading to
the loss of 5.5m working days.
This includes 500,000 back-related injuries a year, mostly caused by
accidents at work. The second biggest problem involves upper-limb injuries.
Ucatt, the construction union, called for an overhaul of the investigations
system for accidents at work after a court verdict yesterday.
British Rail and Tilbury Douglas Construction were each fined Pounds 25,000
and ordered jointly to pay Pounds 25,000 costs after pleading guilty at
London Crown Court to breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act that led
to the deaths of two workers in 1992.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Retail sales show patchy increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail sales grew last month at their fastest annual rate since December
last year, the Confederation of British Industry says today.
The CBI's distributive trades survey of 15,000 outlets in the retail,
wholesale and motor trades shows that retailers last month reported growth
in sales volumes at a much higher level than in the previous two months.
The buoyancy of retail sales runs counter to anecdotal and survey evidence
of a slowdown in consumer demand.
However, the CBI results may be related to the sharp jump in September of
the annual growth rate of M0, the narrow measure of money supply. M0 has
traditionally been closely linked with retail sales. Official figures for
retail sales growth in September will be published tomorrow.
A total of 49 per cent of retailers reported higher sales volumes in the
year to September while 21 per cent said they were lower. The difference
between the two, a positive balance of 28 per cent, was up from a 2 per cent
balance in August. Sales were also higher than retailers had expected.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades survey panel,
said: 'The pick-up in high-street trade reported in September confirms that
the trend in retail sales remains firmly upward.'
He added, however, that the underlying annual growth in volumes had levelled
out in the past few months and followed 'quite an uneven path over most of
the year so far'.
The survey shows that nearly all retailers reported strong volume growth in
the year to September. The biggest increases were in the footwear and
leather sector, where the improvement was the strongest since September last
year.
Chemists and specialist food retailers such as butchers, bakers and
greengrocers reported a decline in annual sales volume growth.
The bulk of the growth in retailing came from mail order groups and big
multiple stores. Single outlets reported a modest increase in volume of
sales.
Wholesalers reported sharp annual growth rates for sales volumes last month,
showing a positive balance of 55 percentage points, the strongest annual
rate since June.
Motor traders reported a fall in sales volumes in the year to September,
with a negative balance of 4 per cent. This was the lowest balance since
December 1993, and much lower than expected.
Both retailers and wholesalers believe sales volumes will rise in October
while motor traders expect a further fall. The CBI warned, however, that
expectations of retail sales had been fulfilled in only three surveys this
year.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Ruling on council hearing due
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Magill, Westminster City Council's district auditor, will announce
today whether he will disqualify himself from public hearings into
allegations of gerrymandering.
If he does, the hearings will not take place at all, he said yesterday. But
if he does not disqualify himself, they will start tomorrow morning.
The hearings were due to start yesterday but were delayed because lawyers
for Dame Shirley Porter, former leader of the council, wanted more time to
argue that Mr Magill should disqualify himself.
At yesterday's one-day hearing, Mr Andrew Arden QC, barrister for the group
of objectors which first lodged the allegations, urged that the hearings
start as soon as possible. He quoted from one of Dame Shirley's interviews
with Mr Magill in which she insisted that she was 'no Asil Nadir'.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, retained by Dame Shirley, said that Mr Magill
should step down because he had acted wrongly during his investigation. Mr
Scrivener said that Mr Magill used emotive words such as 'disgraceful',
'improper' and 'gerrymandering' when he announced his provisional findings
in January, and that he created the 'maximum amount of prejudice' by giving
a press conference.
After a four-year investigation Mr Magill, a senior partner at accountancy
firm Touche Ross, provisionally ruled that Dame Shirley and nine others
should repay Pounds 21.25m spent on selling council homes in marginal wards
to secure victory at the 1990 local elections.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Cleveland seizes Samsung prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Samsung's decision to establish its main European production beachhead at
Wynyard, Cleveland, comes after fierce competition among European Union
members to attract the biggest investment in the region yet by a Korean
company.
The world's fifth-biggest electronics group has been studying sites in the
EU for the past year as part of its strategy to establish regional
manufacturing centres around the globe. It has already selected Tijuana,
Mexico, as its main production complex for North America.
EU candidates included Portugal, Germany and France. the final choice came
down to Spain, where Samsung has TV and VCR manufacturing operations in
Barcelona, and the UK. It produces colour TVs at Billingham, Cleveland.
Samsung plans to spend Dollars 700m (Pounds 443m) on the new project, almost
seven times the average annual investment by Korean companies in the EU.
The proposed complex will have an annual production of 1m computer monitors,
1.3m microwave ovens, 250,000 facsimile machines, 250,000 personal computers
and 3m monitor tubes as well as facilities to make 8in semiconductor wafers
and colour televisions. The facilities will generate Dollars 2bn in annual
turnover.
British officials describe Samsung's project as the single biggest foreign
manufacturing investment in the UK since Nissan's initial Dollars 450m
investment at Sunderland in 1988.
It is a significant boost to overseas expansion by Korean companies, which
lag behind their Japanese competitors in establishing plants abroad. The aim
is to get round protectionist trade barriers and to be close to markets.
Samsung recently announced plans to build a Dollars 500m plant outside
Shanghai.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, believes that the
reasons the UK was selected include labour productivity and infrastructure,
the Koreans' familiarity with the English language, and the previous success
of Korean operations in the UK.
Mr Heseltine, who is on a visit to Seoul, cited the Samsung choice as
supportive of the UK's decision to opt out of the EU social chapter so that
it could offer 'competitive wage rates'. But he added that Samsung found the
UK an attractive place to invest because of its membership in the EU.
The government's offer of financial benefits also influenced Samsung. The
company said direct and indirect assistance accounted for 20 per cent of the
investment cost.
British officials believe the incentive package is worth the price since the
Samsung complex is expected to provide at least 3,000 jobs in a 'regional
unemployment blackspot'. Samsung is expected eventually to buy electronic
components from local suppliers, further boosting employment.
In the past two months seven Korean companies have decided to invest in the
UK, including Goldstar, Samsung's main electronics rival, which announced a
Pounds 10m colour TV plant last week.
Other EU countries are also seeking Korean investment. Daewoo Electronics
has plants in northern France and Samsung plans to establish other European
complexes, possibly in Spain or central Europe, and in eastern Europe.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Endorsing a growing manufacturing reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the world's 18th-largest company opted to spend Pounds 450m on
extending its Cleveland factories, it gave a further vote of confidence in
the quality of British manufacturing.
The activities of Samsung, South Korea's biggest industrial group, range
from semiconductors, electronic watches and computers to shipbuilding, heavy
engineering, petrochemicals and medical equipment.
In the past month NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, Sharp, the Japanese
consumer electronics company and Philips of Holland have all announced
further investment in their UK manufacturing operations, chiefly in the
areas of semiconductors, television picture tubes and white goods.
In addition, Mr Phillip Samper, president of the computer division of Sun
Microsystems, the US workstation manufacturer, said the quality of portable
computers produced by Sun's Scottish plant was on a par with any other
manufacturing region.
Samsung is following this pattern. The company's expansion corresponds with
its stated corporate strategy which is to concentrate investment in
promising sectors of international industry rather than weakening its thrust
by over-diversification.
Mr Chan Bea, managing director of Samsung Electronics in the UK, said
manufacturing in Europe would also avoid regulatory problems with the
European Commission.
The company has been in the UK for 10 years. Its sales have grown 100 per
cent since 1989. It markets microwave ovens, television sets, portable audio
systems and midi systems as well as facsimile machines, computer monitors,
printers and typewriters. It already manufactures 700,000 television sets a
year on Teesside for export to Europe.
Mr Bea pointed out the proximity of Cleveland to Scotland's Silicon Valley
where there are a host of computer companies which could become customers
for Samsung's products.
Further afield the market is also buoyant. More than half the personal
computers sold throughout Europe are manufactured in the UK. About 10.3m
machines worth about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.6bn) were shipped to Europe in
1993. A recent Economist study suggested demand was set for double-digit
growth. It said: 'Business in the 1990s cannot compete without the
efficiency and technology provided by computers . . . the massive price
reductions of the past two years have played a vital part in promoting
continued growth in the sale of PCs.'
The picture for microwave ovens is less clear-cut. While the number of
first-time buyers is continually replenished, it is becoming a replacement
market. The UK is reckoned to be ahead of the rest of Europe, however.
Almost 90 per cent of European households have a washing machine, but only
about 33 per cent have microwave ovens.
Samsung's decision to move its European headquarters to the UK underscores
its decision to centralise European servicing operations at Telford.
The company believes that only eight key electronics brands will survive the
next decade. Its decision to expand in the UK and in Europe is a key element
in its strategy to be one of the survivors.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Grants vital in tipping the investment balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung's new electronics complex underlines the fierce competition between
areas of Europe for investments, and the substantial incentives offered to
tip the balance.
In the summer the rift between UK government departments over the DTI aid
available for inward investment was exposed in a leaked letter in which Mr
Michael Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury, criticised the use
of grants to deal with regional employment imbalances.
But Mr Tim Eggar, trade minister, said on BBC Radio 4 yesterday: 'We have
got to live in the real world, and the real world is that major investment
decisions of this kind inevitably involve a level of government assistance.'
Samsung could, however, have been given more money had it gone to Spain, the
other shortlisted location for the project. The Northern Development Company
was told informally that more was on offer in Spain than in the UK.
Samsung's choice of the north-east will have been influenced by its happy
experience in the region, where it has expanded an investment at Billingham,
Cleveland.
But nobody in the economic development field doubts the important of cash
incentives. At Wynyard, a development area, Samsung has been offered Pounds
58m in regional selective assistance, on the basis of a Pounds 450m project.
If, as hoped locally, the investment goes up to Pounds 600m, applications
for further assistance could be made.
In addition, government-backed developer English Partnerships is putting in
Pounds 9m and Cleveland County Council and Teesside Training and Enterprise
Council Pounds 5m each. Other council aid and European funds have produced
an additional Pounds 1.85m.
As late as last Friday the Northern Development Company did not know if it
had secured the project. Mr John Bridge, chief executive, believes the
Samsung study team made its decision only on Friday, and that Mr KH Lee,
company chairman, confirmed it at the weekend.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Estate moves from carbon to silicon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of Wynyard Park for Samsung's electronics complex is not without
symbolic significance.
This agricultural land was part of the Londonderry family estate, a property
assembled by Victorian coal barons. This century the family fell on harder
times and its ancestral home, Wynyard Hall, and grounds were bought in 1987
by Sir John Hall, a self-made millionaire pitman's son.
Sir John, the developer of the Gateshead MetroCentre and chairman of
Newcastle United Football Club, saw Wynyard as a potential growth point for
the north-east's economic transformation.
In 1991 he said that development in the coming decade would provide up to
10,000 jobs. Yesterday he said that Wynyard, with Samsung now signed up,
would attract Pounds 1bn of investment.
Planning permission - unlikely to be a problem - is needed for Samsung's
400-acre site but Cameron Hall Developments, Sir John's company, already has
permission for business development on another 500 acres of the estate.
Intensive marketing of this site will now start. Executive housebuilding is
already under way elsewhere on the estate.

FT  18 OCT 94 / A boost for the north-east revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Samsung project is a tremendous economic and psychological boost for a
region of the UK that is undergoing its own industrial revolution.
North-east England prides itself on being the UK's biggest focus of Far East
inward investment in manufacturing.
It already boasts dozens of foreign investment projects including two of the
UK's biggest - Nissan's Pounds 926m European car plant at Sunderland, Tyne
and Wear, and Fujitsu's only European semiconductor manufacturing operation,
at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.
Fujitsu announced yesterday that production of 16 megabit D-ram microchips
at this plant, where it has already invested more than Pounds 300m, will
start next April.
The success of these companies, other inward investors and indigenous
companies has helped north-east England establish a track-record for
exporting more of its output than any other part of the UK.
Yet the area still has the highest regional unemployment rate on the
mainland and suffers from continuing painful erosion of industries on which
its prowess, as one of the world's leading industrial regions, was founded
more than a century ago.
The future of its last shipbuilder, Swan Hunter on the Tyne, hangs by a
thread, and it now has only one coal mine, Ellington in Northumberland,
currently mothballed but expected to reopen.
The Samsung investment, with 3,000 promised jobs in electronics, is seen
locally as important in its own right and also for its spin-off potential.
Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, the
inward investment and economic regeneration agency for north-east England
and Cumbria, said: 'It's fundamental. We need, in this process of economic
regeneration, very significant building blocks which set off another wave of
development. This will be like Nissan; there will be a significant supplier
base.'
Mr Bridge believes Samsung's presence will trigger investment nearby from
other companies in related activities such as plastic injection moulding and
wiring systems production.
Cleveland county council yesterday voiced hopes the Samsung decision would
mean 5,000, rather than 3,000, new jobs.
The company's investment, estimated by the NDC at Pounds 600m rather than
the DTI's more cautious figure of Pounds 450m, will be located on 200 acres
of the Wynyard site, but the company has taken an option on a further 200
acres.
'We have been told there are other products in mind,' said Mr Bridge.
Wynyard Park, where Samsung is to establish its electronics complex, is on
the Cleveland/County Durham border and is accessible to job-hunters from
both sides.
In East Durham, the collapse of deep coal mining in the last decade has
brought 10,000 job losses, while in Cleveland, the pillars of the local
economy, chemicals and petrochemicals and steelmaking, have seen heavy job
losses and restructuring.
Between 1981 and 1991 Cleveland lost 6,345 jobs in its oil and chemicals
sector, a 27 per cent drop, 11,235 jobs in metals manufacturing, a 56 per
cent drop, and 2,574 jobs in electrical engineering, a 47 per cent drop. The
Cleveland economy gained 14,800 service - sector jobs, many part-time and
occupied by women, but 18,149 manufacturing jobs, mainly full-time and held
by men, were lost.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Policy on asylum seekers rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office practice of detaining asylum seekers for long periods
without giving reasons is severely criticised in two reports from
humanitarian organisations published today.
In one report, based on a study tracking the fortunes of 50 detained asylum
seekers over 14 months, Amnesty International's British section says
procedures violate international human rights laws and standards.
The other report, from the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of
Torture, a UK-based charity, finds that people who seek asylum after
surviving torture in their own countries are being detained in Britain for
periods ranging from two to 17 months.
About 600 asylum seekers in the UK, out of 50,000 under consideration, are
detained pending a decision on their claims. Amnesty believes that 'in most
cases detention is neither necessary nor for reasons recognised as
legitimate under international standards'. It cites four specific
international agreements to which the UK is a party.
These agreements say that anyone deprived of their liberty is entitled to
challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a court, that detainees
must be given 'prompt and full communication' of the reasons for detention,
and that 'refugees and asylum seekers shall, whenever possible, not be
accommodated with persons detained as common criminals'. Amnesty finds all
these provisions routinely violated under the British system.
On average, Amnesty says, the asylum seekers in its study - none of whom was
charged with any criminal offence - were detained almost three times as long
as remand prisoners charged with serious offences. Twenty-two of the 50 were
eventually released, either on bail or on 'temporary admission', while their
cases were still unresolved. None of these later absconded or failed to
comply with the con-ditions of their release.
The report also condemns the lack of any requirement that detentions should
be justified to a court or similar review body.
The Medical Foundation report is based on 47 cases of detained asylum
seekers visited by doctors from the Foundation since January 1993. In 45 of
these, the foundation was able to document evidence of torture, but
detention continued none the less. The report stresses that detention,
besides adding significantly to the distress of torture survivors, 'makes it
more difficult to make decisions about a person's credibility', because of
the trauma it produces.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers stand to lose from privatisation of the Post Office unless lessons
are learnt from past utility sell-offs, a watchdog said yesterday.
The government-funded National Consumer Council said it could not support
current plans for Post Office privatisation without more safeguards on
pricing and services.
Unless tight price controls are set, the mistakes made in the privatisation
of electricity could be repeated, leading to excess profits for the industry
at consumers' expense, it said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Savings contributed Pounds 211m to government funding in September,
down from Pounds 265m in August. Of this, Pounds 116m was accrued interest.
Net receipts amounted to Pounds 95m while total gross sales were Pounds
719m. The contribution made by premium bonds was almost unchanged, and, at
Pounds 127m, was the highest-selling product.
National Savings is expected to contribute Pounds 3.5bn to government
funding in the 1994-95 financial year and at the end of September had
already raised Pounds 2.17bn. The total invested in National Savings at the
end of September was Pounds 50.5bn.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Career guidance for pupils attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Too many sixth-formers attempt inappropriate academic courses after
receiving inadequate careers guidance, two government inspectorates say
today, John Authers writes.
The Further Education Funding Council for England and the Office for
Standards in Education, which monitors schools, said higher priority should
be given to work-related activities and opportunities for students to take
on 'adult responsibilities', rather than academic A-levels.
They also found that students wishing to move into further or higher
education received better support and help than those seeking work.
The inspectors recommended that colleges should give more attention to
action plans based on students' experience, and that performance indicators
should be used to evaluate careers guidance.
General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) were piloted as an
alternative to A-levels last year, and can be used either for university
entrance or for moving straight to employment. The government hopes this
route will attract those who are unlikely to succeed at A-level. Students
arrive at university with an inadequate grasp of how to manage money, says a
survey by the National Westminster Bank and the University of Exeter. Most
do not count a student loan as a debt, and have unrealistic expectations of
their future earnings.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Sawyer faces early test on Clause 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tom Sawyer, a leading trade union ally of Mr Tony Blair, was yesterday
appointed Labour's general secretary by the party's ruling national
executive committee.
His appointment ensures the loyalty of the party machinery, and helps
prepare the ground for Mr Blair's plan to dump its traditional commitment to
common ownership, which is embodied in Clause 4 of the party's constitution.
It became clear yesterday, however, that Mr Sawyer may have a more difficult
job guiding through reform of Clause 4 than originally supposed.
Officials have calculated that more than half of the main unions affiliated
to the party have clauses in their own constitutions committing those unions
to the long-term goal of common ownership.
Although many of those clauses are more loosely worded than Clause 4 they
will either have to be removed before the unions can support a radical
re-writing of Labour's commitment to common ownership or that re-writing
will have to be more restrained than originally envisaged.
Removing the clauses will require special union conferences and, in most
cases, two-thirds majorities. That may be difficult to achieve even in
Labour loyalist unions such as the GMB general union, whose leadership is in
principle supportive of re-drawing Clause 4.
Mr Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Unison, the public sector union,
replaces Mr Larry Whitty, who was regarded by Mr Blair as too close to the
party's traditional socialist wing. His appointment is a boost to Mr Blair,
who believes that Labour's organisational skills must be sharpened if the
party is to win the next general election.
A former leftwinger, Mr Sawyer is solidly behind Mr Blair's plan to dump
Labour's commitment to common ownership. He said: 'I think that Labour party
members will be very pleased when they see the empowerment that can come
from a revised statement of aims and values.'
Meanwhile, Mr Blair's grip on the party machine is expected to be further
strengthened tomorrow by the election of additional supporters to the shadow
cabinet. The elections are likely to be followed by a thorough shake-up of
the shadow cabinet.
Nominations for the annual elections, which closed yesterday, disclose a
record field of 52 candidates, including 17 women.
There are two vacancies, caused by the elections of Mr Blair and Mr John
Prescott as leader and deputy leader following Mr Smith's death. Both are
likely to go to women, partly because rules introduced last year require MPs
to cast at least four of their 18 votes for women.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the traditionalist former deputy leader, is certain to
return to the shadow cabinet after losing her place in the leadership
elections.
Ms Harriet Harman, the modernist shadow chief secretary, is expected to be
rewarded for her campaign against tax increases by winning the second vacant
slot.
Other candidates include Ms Joyce Quin, who speaks on Europe, Mrs Ann Clwyd
(employment) and Ms Clare Short (women). All narrowly missed election last
year.
Several less well-known MPs are strongly tipped, including Mr Brian Wilson
(transport), Mr Alun Michael (Home Office), Mr Alistair Darling (City), Mr
Nick Brown (Treasury), and Ms Hilary Armstrong, formerly Mr Smith's
parliamentary aide.

FT  18 OCT 94 / London-led operation halts Dollars 10bn international fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) bank fraud was prevented by an international
police operation led by the Metropolitan Fraud Squad.
Details of one of the biggest bank frauds yet attempted emerged yesterday on
the eve of the first National Fraud Forum, which brings together police,
City regulators and private-sector investigators to discuss how to improve
the country's record on fraud prevention and prosecutions.
The victim of the fraud attempt was Agricultural Bank of China, one of
China's big four banks. It involved the issue by the bank of Dollars 10bn in
letters of credit or bank certificates guaranteeing trade payments between
two companies. Letters of credit can be traded or used as collateral when
raising bank loans.
On April 1 last year the Hengshui Central branch of Agricultural Bank issued
200 of these certificates, in the name of United Asia (Group) Corporation, a
shell company based in North America, with payment due to Sherwood
Investments, of the Bahamas.
According to an official with knowledge of the case, the certificates were
genuine in that they were signed by two employees of the bank. However, they
may have been obtained by deception and their export out of China was also
probably illegal.
The official said that the perpetrators of the scheme were too greedy. 'If
there had been less money at stake, they might have got away with it,' he
said.
Most of the certificates were taken on a circuitous route through a series
of offshore centres to the City, where eventually they were presented to
Barclays Bank.
Investigators believe that the aim of presenting them to Barclays was to
obtain a receipt stating that the certificates had been lodged with the
bank. This receipt would then have been used to obtain substantial loans
from other banks.
However, Barclays had suspicions about the provenance of the certificates
and therefore contacted Agricultural Bank's head office and the Bank of
England.
Meanwhile, Chinese authorities had by July last year become aware of the
export of the letters of credit. Messages were sent to all international
banks via the Swift electronic funds transfer network, telling these banks
that the certificates should not be treated as legal tender.
The police in London and New York were alerted. In the next six months, they
recovered 193 of the certificates in London. Another six were found in the
US and West Indies. One was traced to a bank vault in Switzerland.
Mr Lei Ping Wu of Agricultural Bank's London office said that thanks to the
actions of the police, his bank had suffered no loss.
The individual who presented the certificates to Barclays has disappeared.
Several people have been imprisoned in China in connection with the case,
including two bank employees. No charges have been laid against anyone
outside China.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Armed forces set to adopt lower profile in N Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave fresh impetus to the peace process in Northern
Ireland by indicating that the armed forces were preparing to adopt a lower
profile in the province.
Amid clear indications that Downing Street will announce in the next week
that it is ready to hold exploratory talks with Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told MPs he was
planning new measures to reduce the impact of the armed forces' operations.
Mr Rifkind said it would be irresponsible to cut force levels in Ulster
prematurely. But he told the House of Commons that the government aimed to
'make the posture of the military patrols appear less aggressive to the
public'.
He said: 'It can never be normal for soldiers to be deployed on the streets
of the United Kingdom. Our aim is to remove soldiers from the streets of
Northern Ireland - but when it is safe to do so, and not a moment sooner.'
The new measures will be implemented by the GoC (General Officer Commanding)
Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
Yesterday, Rev Ian Paisley, leader of Ulster's Democratic Unionist party,
reiterated that he would not take part in peace talks over the future of
Northern Ireland in spite of the declaration of a ceasefire by loyalist
paramilitaries last week. Mr Paisley condemned the negotiations as a
'counterfeit peace process' and warned that the IRA was continuing to arm
itself.
He reserved particular scorn for Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the
Ulster Unionist party, who made clear at the weekend that he endorsed the
prospect of talks between the British and Irish governments and republican
nationalists.
Mr Paisley accused the UUP leader of 'crawling' to Dublin. Mr Molyneaux last
night had 40 minutes of talks in Downing Street with Mr John Major, prime
minister, on the situation in Northern Ireland. He is believed to have
reaffirmed his tacit support for the British government's plans to hold
preliminary discussions with Sinn Fein.
The cabinet's Northern Ireland sub-committee is expected to meet this week
to make preparations for such talks.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Inland Revenue clash looms over merger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Inland Revenue is privately threatening to tear up its pay agreement
with its staff in retaliation for the creation of a new 'super-union' in the
Civil Service which it fears could lead to more conflict.
The IRSF, the tax officers' union, plans to amalgamate with the NUCPS union
which covers the executive grade in the Civil Service. If their merger plans
are accepted by the members, the new union - which would be the biggest in
the Civil Service - would come into being next October.
Mr Clive Brook, the IRSF general secretary, has already been warned
privately by management that such a move could bring future collective
bargaining arrangements in the Inland Revenue into question.
Under a clause written into the existing agreement either side can reopen
the deal if the 'identity' of either is substantially changed. The Inland
Revenue insisted this should be included in the agreement over Mr Brook's
protest.
It is expected that the proposed merger would change the 'identity' of the
IRSF, thus enabling the Inland Revenue to decide whether to derecognise the
union, end the check-off system of paying union subscriptions or introduce
other restrictions on union activity.
Mr Brook said last night that the Inland Revenue had wanted to see fewer
unions in its business and that the new body was in line with that position.
But management is believed to dislike what it sees as the more aggressive
campaigning tactics and leftwing strategy of the NUCPS, fearing this could
lead to the greater likelihood of disruption.
The Inland Revenue said last night that it would consider its next move if
the new union was created. The executives of both the unions involved in the
merger have just agreed to a joint rulebook.
The IRSF is holding a delegate conference next February and both unions will
ballot their members on the merger in the spring. This will be followed by
further ballots of the rank and file in both unions in the summer to approve
the joint rule book.
Mr John Sheldon, the NUCPS general secretary, said yesterday that his union
was well on the way to financial recovery after restructuring its
organisation with the help of overdraft facilities from the Unity Trust
Bank.
But to allay fears among tax officers that their more prosperous union might
be used to finance the NUCPS's activities, Mr Brook said it had been agreed
to 'ring-fence' the IRSF's Pounds 3m campaign fund.
That money could only be used after the merger by those who now belonged to
his union.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Scottish water costs 'to double'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans by the Scottish Office to involve the private sector in financing
water and sewerage projects will cost businesses and council-tax payers
double what they would pay if they were financed by local councils, says
Scotland's biggest local authority.
Strathclyde regional council yesterday presented calculations showing the
cost to payers of business rates and council tax of a private contractor
building a sewage treatment plant and financing it via the build, own and
operate method. It compared this with its cost of it building the same
installation and borrow from the government's low-interest Loans Fund.
The Scottish Office wants to see 15 water and sewerage projects worth a
total of Pounds 545m financed under the build, own and operate method in the
next few years.
Strathclyde says an Pounds 80m installation financed from the Loans Fund
would have a capital cost over 27 years of Pounds 167m including interest,
and operating costs of Pounds 115m, making Pounds 282m in all. If the same
installation were built under build, own and operate, payers of council tax
and sewerage rates would pay for it according to throughput. Assuming an
average charge in full operation of 20p per cubic metre, the cost to the
public over 27 years would be Pounds 453m.

Mr Don Cruickshank, the director-general of Oftel, said that the
restrictions were 'no longer necessary' because of action taken by Cellnet.
Mr Cruickshank said, however, that he intended to continue monitoring mobile

FT  18 OCT 94 / Minister resists roads budget cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the Transport secretary, is resisting big cuts in next
year's road-building programme, in spite of his determination to promote
policies which are more sympathetic to environmental factors.
As Whitehall departments prepare to finalise their spending plans for next
year the Treasury is putting pressure on the Department of Transport to
reduce its annual Pounds 2bn roads budget, saying that Dr Mawhinney is in
the throes of a re-examination of policy.
But Dr Mawhinney is understood to have warned that it would be irresponsible
to carry out sweeping cuts in road building next year because of commitments
that the government has already made, and that any reductions in the
programme should be deferred.
According to transport department officials about Pounds 900m of the annual
budget is spent on the maintenance of existing roads, and this cannot be
reduced in any event. They say that much of the remaining Pounds 1.1bn has
already been earmarked for specific projects.
Instead, the department is saying that any cuts should come in the second
and third years of the Treasury's public spending projections. This would
allow the roads programme to gradually adapt to a shift in priorities away
from road building.
A senior official said: 'You simply couldn't cut more than Pounds lbn from
the programme in year one. That would produce the most absurd kind of cuts,
with motorways being half-finished and roads ending in the middle of
nowhere.'
At the Conservative party conference last week Dr Mawhinney talked of the
need to achieve 'a better balance between the economic benefits of motoring,
the public's right to choose to drive and what I have called social and
physical environmental protection'.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Banks wary of auditing deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New small businesses are likely to continue to be required by banks to have
their accounts audited in order to borrow money in spite of a government
initiative to reduce auditing burdens, the British Bankers' Association said
yesterday.
The association said banks would support the spirit of the government
deregulation initiative by 'not normally' requiring audited information for
small businesses exempted from such requirements under new legislation.
However, it said banks were likely to continue to ask for audited accounts
when a company had 'no regular or reliable management information,' or when
there was no account history against which to measure ability to repay debt.
Leaders of the association said this would probably include small business
start-ups. Banks will also retain the right to call for audited information
if terms and conditions of loans are not met, although this will be 'used
sparingly'.
The association insisted there was likely to be a significant change in the
behaviour of local managers as a result of guidance being sent out by all
large banks which will change policy to fit in with the government's
initiative.
Legislation has exempted companies with a turnover of less than Pounds
90,000 from having to have accounts audited, and those with a turnover of
between Pounds 90,000 and Pounds 350,000 can replace the audit with an
independent accountant's report.
Mr Paul Chisnall, an assistant director of the association, said banks had
shifted towards a greater appreciation of the benefits of deregulation but
he added that they would still have to 'look very closely' at small business
start-ups because of a lack of account history. Banks were likely to want
properly audited accounts in order to establish 'base figures' as they
started up.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, president, said that account audits were no longer
regarded by banks as an 'essential tool' in monitoring small businesses
because they reflected the past, and banks were more concerned with current
cashflow.
The Auditing Practices Board is expected later this week to publish
guidelines on reporting requirements for accountants who have to provide
independent reports as a substitute for audits in larger small businesses.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Farmland reform boost for tenants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legislation ending security of tenure for new agricultural tenants should
immediately free nearly 1m acres of farmland for rent for periods of five
years or more, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said yesterday.
The institution said this would represent almost 10 per cent of the rented
sector in England and Wales, which is paralysed by landowners' unwillingness
to risk losing control of their land.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said last week that a bill
reviving freely negotiated contracts between farm landlords and tenants
would be introduced early in the parliamentary session which opens next
month.
Mr Martin Lowry of the institution said a survey of 148 rural chartered
surveyors in the summer showed that the legislation would bene-fit the
entire agricultural sector.
He said: 'More farms to rent will allow new blood, some of it from a
non-agricultural background, into the industry, bringing on a fresh
genera-tion of entrepreneurial farmers.'
Under the 1986 Agricultural Holdings Act any tenancy longer than two years
entitles the tenant to stay for life. This has led landowners to resort to a
variety of short-term arrangements covering about a quarter of all tenanted
land.
Mr Lowry said such deals were 'time-consuming, complex and don't lead to
well-farmed land'.
The government is pursuing new legislation after industry-wide agreement
that change is needed. But concern has been expressed in some quarters that
landowners will opt for short-term leases.
Mr Lowry said this fear should be allayed by the survey's findings that 61
per cent of new rentals would be for 10 years or more.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Prices unveiled for Eurostar channel service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The railways of Britain, France and Belgium yesterday announced the start of
their high-speed Eurostar service through the Channel tunnel with prices for
a return ticket from London to Paris or Brussels starting at Pounds 95.
European Passenger Services, the British partner in the three-country
project, said the prices did not seek to undercut airline fares because
Eurostar aims to sell tickets on the basis of more convenient travel. Mr
Richard Edgley, managing director, said: 'We will run a city centre to city
centre service with less hassle. We will also offer better and more
interesting meals.'
He said Eurostar would gain 'a major share' of the market for journeys
between the three capitals and a significant, though probably smaller, share
of longer distance journeys between Manchester and Paris.
Fares for what Eurostar calls its Discovery service start at Pounds 95
return between London and Paris or Brussels if the traveller books 14 days
in advance. They rise to Pounds 155 for a standard ticket, without
pre-booking, and Pounds 195 for first-class travel which includes a hot
three-course meal.
The service starts on November 14 with tickets on sale from October 24.
British Airways said the Eurostar fares were higher than expected, making
its own cheap flights look competitive. BA said air travellers could buy
return flights from London to Paris for Pounds 83, provided they travelled
in mid-week and stayed in the French capital over a Saturday night.
However, Mr Cris Rees, commercial manager at Thomas Cook, the travel agents,
said Eurostar could probably afford to charge a small premium because it
offered a convenient route from the centre of London to the centres of Paris
and Brussels, cutting out travel to and from airports. Mr Rees said
travelling by rail for the weekend would also be more appealing for families
than flying.
American Express, the financial services and travel group, said it welcomed
the added competition for London-Paris travel, the world's busiest air
route. The company said it expected Eurostar to win over travellers who
found it easier to travel to Waterloo station than to Heathrow airport.
American Express said: 'Commuters to Waterloo will just have to change
platforms to travel to Paris.' They would also be able to work more
comfortably on the trains than on an aircraft, the company said.
In the first few months of Eurostar travel departures will be limited to two
a day each way. Services will increase in frequency as more trains and
carriages are delivered.
Because of continued work on the tunnel by Eurotunnel, operator of the
cross-Channel link, there will be no Eurostar services on Saturdays and
Sunday mornings. But the Friday afternoon and Sunday afternoon services will
allow travellers to spend weekends away.
Tickets will go on sale through Eurostar's telesales office, at main railway
stations and through travel agents.
The journey time between London and Paris is three hours and between London
and Brussels 3 1/4 hours. These times will fall when the Belgian and British
high-speed links have been completed.

FT  18 OCT 94 / BR chief hits out at demands of sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes demanded by British Rail's privatisation have slowed improvements in
the quality of service, its chairman, Sir Bob Reid, said last night.
Sir Bob expressed sympathy for the victims of Saturday's rail crash in Kent,
in which five people died. He added that the commitment to safety had not
been compromised.
However, he said: 'The continuing demands of the further reorganisation and
contractual issues have unfortunately not allowed as much managerial effort
as we would have liked to be devoted to the day-to-day activities that
determine the quality of service to our customers, particularly in terms of
punctuality and reliability.'
He said the signalworkers' strike had accentuated problems and the
'consequent loss of momentum'.
He said: 'Sad to say, but we have to face facts. It is those three factors -
the strikes, loss of momentum in investment and slippage in performance -
that have turned 1994 from a potential year of renaissance to one of
disappointment, damage and major threat.'
Sir Bob, giving the annual Dallas Lecture in Glasgow, said the rail industry
would benefit from being made into smaller, more autonomous units which
would 'loosen up rigidities and give flexibility to take account of local
circumstances'.
He said: 'Expenditure on basic infrastructure has fallen seriously behind
what is needed to maintain the sort of performance that we have on the
railways today, let alone improve it.'
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said Sir Bob's comments were
'a thinly veiled indictment of the rail privatisation shambles'.
Meanwhile, the government said that an independent inquiry into the Cowden
crash would be held in public.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, told the Commons that Railtrack, BR
and the Railway Inspectorate were carrying out their own technical
investigation. BR and Railtrack have accepted responsibility for the crash.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Brent Walker jury retires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The jury in the Brent Walker fraud trial retired yesterday to consider its
verdicts. After deliberating for the afternoon it failed to reach any
decisions and was sent away for a night in a hotel.
Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of the Brent
Walker Group, and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, its former finance director, are both
accused of fraudulently boosting the company's profits between 1984 and
1989.
Mr Walker denies four charges of theft involving Pounds 17m, two charges of
false accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the Brent Walker accounts
to overstate profits and assets.
Mr Aquilina denies one charge of theft involving Pounds 4.5m, three of false
accounting and one of conspiring to falsify the company's accounts.
The trial, in an annexe of the Old Bailey, started on June 2.
The prosecution alleges that the Brent Walker profits were illegally boosted
by Pounds 19.3m through bogus film rights transactions which in reality were
funded by Brent Walker money.
The transactions were then concealed by a complicated money laundering
operation involving offshore companies and trusts in the Bahamas, the Isle
of Man and Canada, it is alleged.
The prosecution said profit-boosting enabled a healthier picture of Brent
Walker to be presented to investors when the property and leisure group was
expanding in the mid-1980s.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Texas cuts 900 jobs in management shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Texas Homecare, the UK's second biggest do-it-yourself stores chain, which
is owned by Ladbroke group, is cutting 900 jobs in its 240 stores as part of
a management restructuring.
The redundancies provide further evidence of the depressed state of the DIY
market - one of the fastest-growing sectors of retailing in the 1980s -
which Ladbroke said yesterday remained 'highly competitive'.
Sales growth is slow, with little sign of stimulus from a recovery in the
housing market. Many analysts believe that with more than 1,000 DIY
superstores in operation there is too much capacity in the market.
About half the planned job losses come from reducing the average number of
managers and assistant managers in stores from seven to five, with some
administrative functions being taken over by computer systems. Remaining
assistant managers are being retrained and will spend more of their time on
the shopfloor to improve service.
The other losses result from closure of Texas Pantries snack bars in 170
stores.
Ladbroke said research by Mr John Coleman, the Texas chief executive
recruited from fashion chain Dorothy Perkins last year, showed that the
snack bars did not fit the chain's image and were being under-used.
The group said there was little scope for redeployment of staff, although
generous redundancy terms were being offered.
Restructuring costs of about Pounds 2m will be charged to this year's profit
and loss account, but Ladbroke said resulting cost savings would be
'considerable'.
The recent half-year results of the top three chains reflect the squeeze.
Texas reported a fall in profits from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 2m.
B&amp;Q, the market-leader owned by Kingfisher, saw interim profits increase
slightly from Pounds 41.6m to Pounds 44.5m, but the number three, Do It All,
a joint venture between Boots and WH Smith which is selling 100 of its 240
stores, could only reduce its loss from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 10.5m.
Mr Coleman is attempting to improve Texas's performance by cutting the
number of suppliers from 400 to 200, and renegotiating terms.
He is also refitting 50 stores and introducing more 'heavy' items such as
bricks, cement and timber - often in space vacated by the snack bars - to
cater properly for the 'high-spending DIY enthusiast'.
Ladbroke, which has no other retail interests apart from Texas, says it has
no plans to sell the chain, but analysts believe it might be prepared to if
its performance could be improved sufficiently to attract buyers.

FT  18 OCT 94 / ITV to pitch for lottery ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV is seriously considering its own 'unofficial' National Lottery programme
to counter the official live draw on BBC 1 every Saturday evening.
The ITV national network is saying nothing about its plans other than to
insist that its viewers will be kept fully informed about the National
Lottery that will start creating millionaires from November 19.
ITV could simply scroll the winning numbers across the bottom of the screen
while sticking to its existing schedule. But it is thought probable that ITV
will put on a matching lottery-related programme.
The signs that ITV intends to be competitive on what could be one of the
top-rated programmes on British television came yesterday as Camelot, the
National Lottery operator and the BBC confirmed that they had signed a
three-year contract.
The BBC gave few details of the content of the show but it did unveil the
regular presenters who will take over after the initial 'extravaganza' to be
hosted by Noel Edmonds. They will be Anthea Turner, a presenter on GMTV, the
commercial breakfast station, and Gordon Kennedy, the comedian and comic
actor.
After the opening draw the programme will be broadcast from venues all over
the country.
Mr Alan Yentob, controller of BBC 1, said yesterday he was not worried about
a potential response from ITV.
Mr Yentob said: 'This is the event, the real thing, and most people will
want to watch that.'
The lottery result will also be carried live on BBC Radio 1.
The BBC will announce today details of a competition to find a member of the
public to be the first person to press the button to start the machine that
will draw the winning six numbers.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade figures
are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German
current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade
balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free
on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF
method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up
to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West
Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of
England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from
national government and central bank sources.

The European Union and east Asian countries may hold a summit late next year
at which government leaders would aim to forge closer economic and trade
ties between the two regions, according to European Commission officials.
The EU also plans to renew attempts to establish a dialogue with the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, the five-year-old grouping which
embraces the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand as well as Japan
and 11 other Asian countries.
The initiatives are intended to accelerate recent efforts to deepen
relations between Europe and Asia, amid growing European fears of being
excluded from developments in the world's fastest-growing economic region.
Until now, most of the running has been made by the Europeans. However, EU
officials say the proposal for a summit is Asian-inspired, and has been
backed particularly strongly by Singapore and Thailand. The proposal has yet
to be placed formally on the EU agenda but may be raised during a visit to
Paris this week by Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister.
As president of the EU Council of Ministers in the first half of next year,
France would be closely involved in preparing the ground for a summit.
Germany, the current council president, has called for stronger EU links
with Asia.
A senior European Commission official said yesterday that if the summit went
ahead, participants would be likely to include government leaders from
Japan, Taiwan and Korea, as well as from the six members of the Association
of South East Asian Nations.
The official said the meeting was envisaged as a relatively informal event
which would seek to encourage increased trade and investment between Europe
and Asia and closer co-operation between governments of the two regions in
the new World Trade Organisation.
Talks with Asian leaders would also bolster European efforts to establish
closer contacts with Apec, which is expected to agree a timetable for trade
liberalisation by its members at a summit meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, next
month.

Toyota of Japan is considering increasing vehicle production capacity at its
Indonesian and Philippines units to an annual 150,000 and 50,000 vehicles
respectively by 1997, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Such a move would double its combined vehicle production in south-east Asian
countries to an annual 520,000 in 1997, a spokesman said. In 1993, Toyota
produced 24,799 vehicles in the Philippines, 51,535 in Indonesia, 114,752 in
Thailand, 52,928 in Taiwan and 13,488 in Malaysia. In February 1993, Toyota
said its Thai unit Toyota Motor Thailand in Samrong, east Thailand, would
invest about 9bn baht (Dollars 360m) over the next four years to double car
production capacity to 200,000 and set up a training centre for service
technicians.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi to launch Dutch-made hatchback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Motors is to begin its first car production in Europe in the
first half of next year at its joint venture plant in the Netherlands, Mr
Hiroshi Ninomiya, president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales Europe, said last
night.
The company aims to achieve production of up to 100,000 Mitsubishi cars a
year by 1997 at the Nedcar plant, which it owns jointly with Volvo, the
Swedish carmaker, and the Dutch government, each holding a one-third stake.
The partners are investing Fl 3.4bn (Dollars 1.9bn) in the project to
modernise the former Volvo Car BV plant at Born in the Netherlands in order
to create a total capacity to produce 200,000 cars a year, which will be
shared equally by Mitsubishi and Volvo.
Mr Ninomiya disclosed in a speech at the Birmingham motor show that
Mitsubishi would initially launch from the Dutch plant a five-door hatchback
car, code-named MX, between its existing Mitsubishi Lancer and Galant ranges
in size. It is expected to be followed later by a four-door saloon version,
and possibly an estate car.
It will compete directly with rivals such as the Ford Mondeo and the Opel
Vectra/Vauxhall Cavalier, as well as the European-built products of other
Japanese carmakers such as the Nissan Primera and the Toyota Carina, both
assembled in the UK.
The new car will be unveiled at the Amsterdam motor show in January and will
go on sale in continental European markets from mid-1995 and in the UK from
November next year. The Volvo version of the new range, which is expected
eventually to replace the current Dutch-built Volvo 400, will have a
different exterior and interior styling and is expected to be unveiled in
the autumn next year.
Mitsubishi is following the same strategy as its Japanese competitors by
choosing the large family car sector of the European car market for its
first locally-built products in Europe. Mr Ninomiya said the local European
content of the new Mitsubishi range would exceed 85 per cent.
Purchases from components suppliers in Europe for the Mitsubishi car alone
are expected to total more than Fl 1bn a year by the time output reaches
100,000 cars a year, the company said yesterday. More than 150 suppliers
have already been selected in Europe, including some local European
subsidiaries of Japanese components groups, such as Calsonic in the UK,
which will supply radiators and cooling systems.
Mitsubishi plans to import all its petrol engines (in 1.6 and 1.8 litre) and
automatic gearboxes from Japan, but it is understood that it will buy a 1.9
litre diesel engine and all its manual gearboxes from Renault, the French
carmaker.
Mr Ninomiya said that Mitsubishi had drawn heavily on the latest Japanese
production technology to modernise the Dutch plant, organised along the
lines of its Mizushima plant in Japan.
Mitsubishi said it planned initially to achieve around 20 hours per car
assembly time at the Born plant, but this would be reduced later to 17 hours
per car when full capacity was reached. It would take around 7 minutes to
change the tools on the heavy stamping presses. The plant will include 305
robots.
Around half of the Fl 3.4bn earmarked for the Nedcar project had been
invested to date. Mr Ninomiya said Mitsubishi Motors, the third largest
Japanese vehicle producer, was seeking a 5 per cent share of the global
vehicle market by 2000.
To achieve this goal it was aiming to raise its share of the domestic
Japanese market from 12 to 15 per cent, to increase its share of the Asian
and Asean market from 20 to 25 per cent and to gain a 2 per cent share of
the combined European and US markets.

FT  18 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Honda to double Thai capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Honda is investing more than Y10bn (Dollars 100m) in a new car-making plant
in Thailand, a move which will double its Thai capacity and may lead to the
production of a small, popular car for Asia, the company announced
yesterday. A ground-breaking ceremony for the new press-stamping factory
near Ayutthaya, 70km north of Bangkok, is to take place next week.
The plant, which should be completed in early 1996, will incorporate
research and development capability, according to the Japanese vehicle
maker.
The decision to double capacity reflects both the rapid growth of the Thai
domestic market for cars and Thailand's campaign to become a regional
automotive centre by welcoming foreign manufacturers with investment
incentives.
'Thailand is one of the best potential markets in Asia,' Mr Tetsuyo Honda, a
Honda executive in Bangkok, said yesterday. China, Indonesia, and India were
also promising markets in the longer term, he said.
Honda in Thailand does not make the pick-up trucks which at present account
for more than half the vehicles sold in the country. With only a 7.4 per
cent share of the total Thai vehicle market, it lags behind the four
dominant Japanese manufacturers: Toyota, Isuzu, Nissan and Mitsubishi.
But sales of Honda passenger cars, most of them Civics and Accords assembled
at an existing plant in Thailand, have surged 60 per cent in the first nine
months of this year to reach 26,000 units, giving Honda a 23 per cent share
of Thai passenger car market - second only to Toyota.
With increasing spending power and growing wealth in the population, the
Thai passenger car market is expected to grow strongly to reach about
400,000 units by the end of the decade, Honda said. The market grew rapidly
from 67,000 units sold in 1991 to 174,000 units last year, although it has
declined by 14 per cent in the first nine months of 1994.
'Currently the pick-up market is bigger than the passenger car market,' said
Mr Honda, 'but the desire of mankind is for more speedy and more comfortable
transport. This kind of desire is unlimited. This is the market trend.'
Honda expects its expanded Thai manufacturing facility to be one of the
recipients of vehicle components it will produce in China under a joint
venture arrangement with a Chinese parts maker which it announced last week.

Heineken, the Dutch brewer, is planning to build the first brewery
majority-owned by foreign shareholders in Cambodia. The brewery in Phonmh
Penh will have an initial capacity of 170,000 hectolitres when completed in
mid-1996 at a cost of Dollars 25m. Cambodia's beer market was equal to
160,000hl in 1993 - about 2 litres per capita - but is expected to grow to
270,000hl by the end of the decade. The capacity of the brewery could be
gradually expanded to 500,000hl to meet demand. The country has only one
brewery, Heineken said.
The Dutch beer group and its Singapore-based partners Fraser &amp; Neave will
own 80 per cent of the brewery, to be called Cambodia Brewery, through their
existing joint venture Asia Pacific Breweries (APBL). The remainder will be
owned by Progress Import and Export, the Cambodian importer of APBL's Tiger
beer brand. The Cambodian brewery will produce Tiger beer as well as ABC
Stout, another APBL brand.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days of hard election campaigning since the US congressional recess
began has failed to reverse the disillusioned and anti-incumbent mood among
US voters,according to an Associated Press poll.
The poll, released yesterday, found only 35 per cent of the electorate in
favour of re-electing their own congressional representatives. However, only
26 per cent thought much would change if the Republicans took control of
Congress.
There was good and bad news for both parties engaged in a campaign so far
permeated by rancour and sleaze. Republicans were slightly more likely to
vote for newcomers than Democrats, who risk losing control of the Senate
and, conceivably, the House as well in the November 8 election.
However, Democrats had a slight edge with 38 per cent of the voters against
37 per cent in favour of Republicans.
Democratic party strategists fear the apathy and anger in the electorate is
more likely to keep Democrats at home and drive Republicans to the polls.
President Bill Clinton and the national Democratic party have sought to turn
the anger towards the 'obstructionist' Republicans in Congress.
Recent missteps by Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader in the
House, have given the Democrats the opportunity to campaign with a national
theme. His 'Contract With America', unveiled last month, promises a balanced
budget, tax cuts and strengthening of defence - a prescription Mr Clinton is
deriding as warmed-over Reaganism.
Mr Gingrich has also warned that Democrats will be portrayed as 'the enemies
of ordinary Americans'.
This has given ammunition to Mr Clinton, whose approval rating on foreign
policy has been rising.

US business inventories rose 1 per cent in August, the fifth straight
increase and the biggest advance since May, in what analysts said is fresh
evidence of continuing economic expansion. The Commerce Department also
reported yesterday that the rise was easily outpaced by business sales,
which surged 3 per cent in August, the biggest jump in over seven years. The
Commerce Department said inventories totalled a seasonally adjusted Dollars
903.6bn, up from Dollars 894.7bn in July, more than twice the rise expected
by analysts.

Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's former finance minister, was
yesterday confirmed as the country's future president following elections
two weeks ago. With the final votes counted yesterday, Mr Cardoso polled
34.4m votes or 54.3 per cent of the valid votes cast. His nearest rival,
left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, polled 27 per cent. The
right-winger, Mr Eneas Carneiro, seen as a protest candidate, came third
with 7.4 per cent, beating established politicians Mr Orestes Quercia and Mr
Leonel Brizola, who polled 4.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively. Most
votes had been counted by early last week, but delays and fraud allegations
in Rio de Janeiro slowed the final announcement of the results. Mr Cardoso,
who is on holiday in Russia with his wife, is due to take office on January
1.

Cuba said yesterday its security forces had captured a raiding party of
seven armed Cubans from Miami who landed by launch on a causeway near
Caibarien on the island's northern coast early on Saturday. The Interior
Ministry said the seven, who wore camouflage uniforms, shot dead a local
fishermen. Three of the raiders were wounded in a shootout with the security
forces. The ministry described the seven as mercenaries, and the incident in
Villa Clara province as a 'strange attempt of armed infiltration coming from
the US'. It occurred a week before Cuban and US delegations were due to meet
in Havana to review a bilateral immigration accord signed on September 9. In
January 1992 Cuba said it executed by firing squad one of three Miami Cuban
exiles captured landing with arms and explosives on the north coast.

The US is to provide Dollars 100m in new funds over the next fiscal year to
finance Haiti's economic reconstruction now that President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide has returned to power. The new money, part of an ambitious recovery
plan announced yesterday, is in addition to the Dollars 100m already
budgeted by the US for Haiti in the coming year. The State Department's
Agency for International Development (Aid) has also indicated pledges of
Dollars 350m from other donors including the World Bank, the Inter American
Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union.
Haiti's donor needs in the first year are estimated at Dollars 555m of which
Dollars 272.3m must be available in the first four months of Mr Aristide's
new government. The US Treasury Department is co-ordinating a Dollars 83m
debt relief plan for Haiti which will clear all arrears until the end of the
year. Help with Haiti's balance of payments problems is also contemplated so
that depleted inventories can be replenished and the cost of government can
be covered until tax collection is sorted out.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Canada's westerners flex their muscles: Economic growth
gives them voice in separatist debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An unusual event in Canadian politics took place last month when Mr Ralph
Klein, Alberta's unilingual premier, appeared as the guest speaker at a
chamber of commerce function in Sherbrooke, Quebec.
Thousands of miles and a huge cultural divide separate the French-speaking
province from the prairies and mountains of Alberta and the rest of western
Canada. Many westerners resent French signs at federal government offices in
Vancouver, Calgary and Winnipeg. For their part, few Quebecois have been
'out west'.
Mr Klein's trip to Quebec, however, was a sign of the critical role which
the four western provinces are set to play in the intensifying debate over
the francophone province's future place in Canada, leading up to the
independence referendum which the newly elected separatist government in
Quebec plans to hold next year. The run-up to the referendum could also make
or break the reputations of several of the west's most prominent
politicians.
The western provinces - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba
 -have for years resented the influence wielded in national affairs by
Ontario and Quebec, which are by far the most economically powerful
provinces.
Mr David Elton, president of the Canada West Foundation, a Calgary policy
research group, observes that whenever a westerner hears about a new federal
initiative, 'you may not know what it is, but you know you want to be
sitting down when you hear it'.
However, the west's clout has grown appreciably in recent years. Bank of
Nova Scotia forecasts that British Columbia's economy, bolstered by a flood
of immigrants and climbing pulp, paper and metal prices, will expand by 4.8
per cent this year, the strongest growth rate among Canada's 10 provinces.
Alberta, which depends heavily on oil, natural gas and wheat, is expected to
come in second with a 4.5 per cent growth rate.
Alberta and Saskatchewan have made more progress than most other provinces
in bringing down yawning budget deficits, to the point where Alberta is on
track to balance its budget in 1996.
On the political front, Conservative westerners gained a new voice in last
year's general election when the Reform party, which is based in Calgary,
won 52 seats in the House of Commons, all but one of them west of Ontario.
Reform reaffirmed its opposition to official bilingualism at a convention
last weekend. It is also opposed to any special concessions for Quebec.
'People want to hear tough talk from their politicians on the Quebec issue,'
says Prof David Bercuson, a political scientist at the University of
Calgary.
Many westerners take a more conciliatory line. Mr Elton estimates only 25-30
per cent think that if Quebecois choose to leave Canada in the forthcoming
referendum, nothing should be done to stop them. The west's distance from
Ottawa and its increasingly close links with east Asia and with neighbouring
US states belie a strong attachment to Canada. Periodic initiatives to bring
western US states and Canadian provinces together in a 'Rocky Mountain
Corridor' have so far been confined to commercial links.
Mr Klein, who is by far the west's most popular politician at present, has
given notice that he will be a voice of moderation in the national unity
debate. 'Canada may not have succeeded in everyone's eyes,' he told his
audience in Sherbrooke, 'but we have not failed. Our federal system of
government has allowed both Alberta and Quebec to manage our own economies,
and to protect our diverse culture, language, heritage and history.'
Mr Klein's closest ally in national politics is Mr Jean Charest, the 36-year
old Quebecois who took over the Progressive Conservative party after its
near-annihilation in last year's election. The Conservatives, who ruled
Canada from 1984 to 1993, lost all but two of their seats in parliament.
Mr Klein believes that only Mr Charest, who is expected to emerge in coming
months as one of most effective federalist voices within Quebec, can revive
Conservative fortunes.
The two men have recently indicated - without putting flesh on their ideas -
that they favour a middle ground between Quebec breaking away and the status
quo. Mr Elton agrees that 'a creative, third option will emerge'.
But the risk remains quite high that the west could hasten rather than
hinder a break-up. Mr Mike Harcourt British Columbia's premier, was widely
seen as playing into the separatists' hands earlier this year with remarks
that while Quebecois and westerners were the best of friends, they would
become the worst of enemies if Quebec decided to go its own way.
The new government in Quebec has an interest in provoking further such
outbursts. After only a month in office, it has already raised hackles by
turning a number of relatively minor irritants into evidence of the
inability of French- and English-speaking Canada to live together.
It would take a handful of western politicians to rise to the PQ's bait or
the Reform Party to regain its stride for Mr Klein's optimistic scenario to
start unravelling. On the other hand, if the separatist threat is defused,
Mr Klein and Mr Charest could emerge as the saviours of Canada.

FT  18 OCT 94 / US to push for GM truck recall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US transport secretary said yesterday he would push for a compulsory
recall of General Motors pick-up trucks with side-mounted fuel tanks in a
move that brings to a head a long-running dispute over the vehicles' safety.
Mr Robert Pena said research carried out by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration showed that about 150 people had died in crashes
involving the GM trucks as a result of the side-mounted tanks and that a
further 32 more lives were likely to be lost, based on past trends.
Critics of the trucks say they have a tendency to burst into flames when
involved in collisions from the side. GM has already refused a 1993 request
from the NHTSA for a voluntary withdrawal of the pick-up trucks, of which
around 9m were built between 1973 and 1987 and 4.5m are still on the roads.
In a potentially damaging rebuke of GM management, Mr Pena also said the
carmaker was aware of the alleged design flaw 'possibly as early as the
mid-1970s but certainly by the 1980s.' Despite this, the company 'chose not
to alter the design for 15 years', he said, adding that the GM management in
place at the time 'appears to have made a decision favouring sales over
safety'.
After 1987 GM redesigned the vehicle to locate the fuel tanks inside the
main frame.
GM responded angrily to Mr Pena's comments, claiming his verdict was
'totally unjustified'. It would fight a recall, if necessary in court, and
said 'the suggestion that GM puts sales ahead of safety is outrageous and
wrong'.
The announcement comes 18 months after the transport secretary took the
unusual step of intervening personally to review the case in the absence of
a full-time administrator of the NHTSA.
His decision sets the stage for public hearings on the matter on December 6,
after which a final view will be taken on whether to order a compulsory
recall.
Yesterday's announcement was the transport secretary's initial decision
having reviewed the evidence put to him by the NHTSA. He will take a final
decision based on evidence from interested parties at the public hearing.
The direct harm to GM from such a recall could be minimal, since the US
authorities' decision would only apply to vehicles made within the past
eight years. However, it would hand valuable ammunition to lawyers
attempting to extract settlements from the carmaker under product liability
suits.
Last year a federal court approved a settlement under which GM was to offer
discount vouchers to owners of the pick-up trucks, enabling them to buy new
GM trucks for Dollars 1,000 less than the list price. That agreement,
however, has since been thrown out by state courts in Texas and Georgia.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Campaign fails to dent disillusionment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten days of hard election campaigning since the US congressional recess
began has failed to reverse the disillusioned and anti-incumbent mood among
US voters, according to an Associated Press poll.
The poll, released yesterday, found only 35 per cent of the electorate in
favour of re-electing their own congressional representatives. However, only
26 per cent thought much would change if the Republicans took control of the
Congress.
There was good and bad news for both parties engaged in a campaign so far
permeated by rancour and sleaze. Republicans were slightly more likely to
vote for newcomers than Democrats, who risk losing control of the Senate
and, conceivably, the House as well in the November 8 poll.
However, Democrats had a slight edge with 38 per cent of the voters against
37 per cent in favour of Republicans.
Democratic party strategists fear the apathy and anger in the electorate is
more likely to keep Democrats at home and drive Republicans to the polls.
President Bill Clinton and the national Democratic party recognise the
threat and have sought to turn the anger towards the 'obstructionist'
Republicans in Congress.
Recent missteps by Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader in the
House, have given the Democrats the opportunity to campaign with a national
theme. His 'Contract With America', unveiled last month and signed by 300
Republican incumbents and challengers, promises a balanced budget, tax cuts
and strengthening of defence - a prescription Mr Clinton is deriding as
warmed-over Reaganism.
Mr Gingrich has also warned that Democrats will be portrayed as 'the enemies
of ordinary Americans'.
This has given ammunition to Mr Clinton, whose approval rating on foreign
policy has been rising in the wake of US action in Haiti and towards Iraq.
However, he remains deeply unpopular in large sections of the country.
'They are going to give us the trickle-down economics of the 1980s. They are
going to give us their 'politics of the enemies list' of the 1970s,' Mr
Clinton said at the weekend, referring to the late President Richard Nixon's
obsession with his opponents.
Key to the Democrats' chances of stemming a Republican tide will be
delivering the message of Mr Clinton's accomplishments to voters, still
anxious about job security and profoundly ignorant of the nation's business.
Mr Richard Morin, polling director for the Washington Post, noted at the
weekend that few Americans knew the names of congressional leaders and four
out of 10 think Republicans control Congress.
Most could not name a single piece of legislation passed by Congress, and
half could not think of a single Clinton accomplishment. Those that could
named healthcare reform, which was never passed.

Argentinians will re-elect President Carlos Menem next May without the need
for a damaging second-round run-off, leaving the opposition vote divided
among rival factions, according to an opinion poll published yesterday. The
poll adds weight to an important victory earlier this month for the
president's Peronist party in Buenos Aires province. Governor Eduardo
Duhalde, the second force in Mr Menem's party, overwhelmingly won a
plebiscite allowing him to seek re-election, strengthening the Peronists'
claim that their policies still carry majority support. Yesterday's poll,
published in the government-leaning La Nacion, showed the Peronists
capturing 43.5 per cent of the vote, with the two main opposition forces,
the centre-left Frente Grande and the Radical party, mustering only 20.7 and
18.9 per cent respectively.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq's parliament ended a special session yesterday by backing President
Saddam Hussein's handling of thorny relations with the United Nations, but
did not reveal if it had approved the recognition of Kuwait's borders and
the Gulf state's sovereignty - a fundamental Security Council precondition
for any moves towards the easing of sanctions.
The hastily called meeting had been widely expected to meet the terms
required by this weekend's Security Council resolution, calling on Iraq to
make the recognition through 'full and formal constitutional procedures'.
But no announcement came at the end of the meeting. At the UN in New York,
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, reported formally on his
Baghdad talks and reiterated Moscow's view members should consider lifting
the oil embargo in about six months if Iraq showed honest co-operation and
followed through with recognition of Kuwait's borders. Ms Madeleine
Albright, the US delegate, responded that the crisis created by the recent
Iraqi troop deployments was still not over. As for promises made to Mr
Kozyrev, the US placed no more value on these than on previous Iraqi
pledges. The council should categorically reject any idea of rewarding Iraq
for 'partial compliance with some of its obligations', she said, citing a
list of other requirements under UN resolutions.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Japanese bankruptcies decline

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate bankruptcies in Japan continue to decline, but those companies
that do collapse are getting bigger, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit
research agency. The number of companies to close their doors fell by 6.8
per cent from a year earlier to 1,143 in September, for the third month in a
row. But their debts piled up by 30.2 per cent to Y568bn (Pounds 3.8bn), the
highest this year, a sign of how companies damaged in the recession can
easily be brought down by the strains on working capital imposed by even a
gentle upturn. A handful of large corporate collapses was to blame,
including the Y100bn failure of Fasuto, a property developer, and a rise in
bankruptcies in construction and manufacturing, Teikoku says. Of the total,
702 bankruptcies were caused by recession, while a surprisingly low 10
casualties were attributed to the strength of the yen.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Interest rate controls lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bank interest rates in Japan were yesterday freed from final government
controls, as the finance ministry completed a series of deregulatory
measures begun in 1985. Interest rates on ordinary and savings deposits rose
slightly above peviously fixed levels, in line with the general upward drift
in market interest rates. Rates on ordinary bank deposits, which were a
uniform 0.22 per cent a year, increased to between 0.27 per cent and 0.3 per
cent at the country's main commercial banks. Rates on time savings deposits
rose by between 0.05 and 0.1 percentage points. Until 1985, virtually all
Japanese interest rates were fixed by the government, as it sought to keep
borrowing and lending rates low to finance post-war economic reconstruction.
But, under pressure from foreign governments and financial institutions, the
finance ministry allowed a limited deregulation of interest rates that year.
The deregulation will put further competitive pressure on banks, already
weakened by bad debts.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Tokyo surplus down again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's trade surplus continued its slow decline in September, for the
second month running, with an unexpectedly large 4.6 per cent annualised
fall, to Dollars 11.94bn (Pounds 77.2m). A strong growth in imports, sucked
in by Japan's recovering economy, outweighed a rise in exports to the
fast-developing markets of Asia and to a strong US economy. It brings the
trade gap for the six months to the end of September to Dollars 59.38bn or
0.7 per cent less than the same period of 1993, the first such decline for 3
1/2 years. On a three-month sliding average, which shows a clearer trend for
Japan's volatile surplus, the gap, at Dollars 9.4bn, is the lowest since
January last year.
The good news was partly undermined by a 13.2 per cent rise in Japan's trade
surplus with the US, to Dollars 27.09bn in the six months to September,
suggesting yesterday's figure will bring little relief to industry in the
form of a weaker yen. Japan's exports to all destinations in the first six
months of the fiscal year rose 8.3 per cent, while imports grew rather
faster, by 12.7 per cent. Increased energy use during an unusually hot
summer is one reason for the rise in imports. Another is strong growth in
purchases of foreign food, drink, clothing, where the yen's strength has fed
through to bargain prices. Three-quarters of export growth came from sales
to other Asian countries, Japan's fastest growing market and investment
destination, where the trade surplus rose to Dollars 31.4bn.

Exporters complain of unfair burdens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The central bank of Kenya has come under siege from irate exporters who
claim a rapid appreciation of the Kenya shilling is strangling their Dollars
200m (Pounds 133m) annual sales of fresh vegetables and cut flowers to
European markets.
Since the abolition of foreign exchange controls 12 months ago, the Kenyan
currency has strengthened by more than 30 per cent against the dollar. A
wave of speculative capital has come from abroad, chasing high-yielding
Treasury bills which offer some of the best rates of return in the world.
Exporters complain they are shouldering the cost of the government's
inability to bring its budget deficit, and the inefficiencies of its large
parastatal sector, under control.
'Interest rates must come down,' says Mr Richard Evans of Homegrown, the
largest suppliers of fresh horticultural produce to Marks and Spencer in the
UK.
'Speculators are making windfall profits on Kenyan treasury bills, while my
earnings are down by 30 per cent.' Smaller export-oriented companies, he
adds, are on the brink of disaster.
The predicament of Kenya's horticulture exporters, who are the third largest
exchange currency earners after tourism and coffee, poses an unprecedented
challenge for Mr Micah Cheserem, central bank governor.
If it were not for the bank's frequent interventions in the money market to
buy surplus dollars, the shilling would be even stronger than it is.
But the central bank has already accumulated Dollars 800m of reserves,
enough to cover six months' imports, and ruled out any more interventions,
to stabilise the currency market.
The unexpected dollar bounty marks a dramatic turn of events. Only last
year, the Kenyan government was forced to reschedule Dollars 500m of debt
arrears.
Mr Cheserem believes his success in curbing inflation, from an annualised
rate of over 50 per cent last year to under 20 per cent, should allow
interest rates to come down and a more realistic exchange rate to emerge.
Treasury bill yields have fallen from a high of 80 per cent in June 1993 to
16 per cent this month, but commercial banks have been slow to follow suit.
The prohibitive cost of credit has discouraged new investment in Kenya's
economy, which has seen no significant growth in over two years.
'When inflation reaches single digits,' Mr Cheserem says, 'we will see a
revival in economic activity, and the greater demand for imports should ease
the dollar glut.'
Kenya will be hosting an investors' conference in London next month, during
which its rapid progress in deregulating the economy will be on display.
Import curbs have been abolished, the currency is now freely convertible,
and a host of incentives are in place to attract foreign investors.
Doubts persist, however, about the willingness of President Daniel arap
Moi's government to tackle more fundamental reforms.
Little progress has been made in the programme to privatise loss-making
parastatals, largely because of the inertia of civil servants. Meanwhile,
the services provided by parastatals (telecommunications, electricity, water
and the upkeep of roads) continues to deteriorate.
President Moi has faced an upsurge in social unrest in recent months, with
doctors and university lecturers staging strikes to demand government
recognition of their unofficial trade unions.
Both groups returned to work in September defeated, but the government's
refusal to tolerate independent trade unions has drawn criticism from human
rights groups and donor governments.
Donors will be meeting in late November to review Kenya's economic progress
and assess the country's aid requirements for 1995.
Aid pledges are expected to be substantially lower than the Dollars 850m
obtained last year, partly because of continued concern over Kenya's human
rights record.

FT  18 OCT 94 / India relaxes bank lending rate controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
India yesterday scrapped most controls on bank lending rates to promote
cheaper credit, greater liberalisation in financial markets and more
competition in the banking industry. The decision, announced by the Reserve
Bank of India, the central bank, will bring a decline in lending rates for
blue-chip borrowers and is expected to boost economic growth.
The changes will help the government rebut criticism that India is dragging
its feet over economic reforms. Mr C. Rangarajan, reserve bank governor,
said the new policy marked a continuation of financial reforms. While
controlling inflation remained important, the central bank would tolerate a
faster rate of money supply growth than before: 16 per cent for the year to
the end of March 1995, against an original target of 14-15 per cent.
Industry welcomed the prospect of lower interest rates. Mr Subodh Bhargava
of the Confederation of Indian Industry said: 'The new policy includes
initiatives industry has been seeking.'
The latest reforms were contained in the central bank's announcement of its
credit policy for the six months to the end of March. Minimum lending rate
is to be deregulated for loans of about Rs200,000 (Pounds 4,123). Controls
remain in place for smaller loans.
Bankers were divided over the extent of likely declines in lending rates
from the present 14 per cent. Some forecast falls up to 2 percentage points,
others a decrease of 0.5 percentage points. Biggest benefits are expected to
go to big blue-chip borrowers able to negotiate good terms. An important
constraint on cutting lending rates will be that deposit rates will remain
fixed, though the key savings rate will fall from November 1 by 0.5 of a
percentage point to 4.5 per cent.
State-controlled banks are under pressure to improve their profitability.
But competition from privately owned banks will tend to encourage lending
rate cuts. Also, the reserve bank reduced the statutory liquidity ratio (the
ratio of deposits which banks must deposit with the central bank), from a
maximum 33.75 per cent to 31.5 per cent. It raised from Rs2bn to Rs5bn the
ceiling for loans from all Indian banks to a single large project.
Industrial output in June rose 8.6 per cent from the same month in 1993,
figures published yesterday showed. The recent surge in industrial activity
shows no sign of abating. Output in the first quarter of 1994-95 rose 7.8
per cent.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Gaza witnesses second day of riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian students rioted in Gaza for a second day in a row yesterday,
following an upsurge in militant feeling after the killing of three Islamic
kidnappers in an Israeli raid last week and an internal Palestinian
crackdown on the fundamentalist organisation, Julian Ozanne reports.
The students, supporters of the Hamas Islamic group responsible for the
kidnapping and killing of an Israeli soldier, stoned a joint patrol of
Israeli and Palestinian police and overran an Israeli military checkpoint.
The continuing riots reveal the bitter divide which has emerged between Mr
Yassir Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation and Hamas since the
kidnapping crisis.
In an effort to calm the tension, Mr Arafat yesterday began releasing some
of the 300 Hamas activists he arrested last week and detained a PLO general
who ordered his troops to fire in the air during a Hamas demonstration at
the Gaza central prison on Saturday.
Mr Arafat's advisers have warned the PLO leader against giving in to Israeli
and western pressure to deal a decisive blow to Hamas, which could risk
civil war.
But relations between the PLO and Hamas, which opposes peace with Israel and
is bent on the destruction of the Jewish state, have reached an all-time low
and have left deep uncertainty about political stability in the Gaza Strip.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Three days is a long time in this peace process: Roger
Matthews shows just how delicately balanced Arab-Israeli negotiations have
proved to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just how delicately balanced the Middle East peace process remains was never
better illustrated than during the past 72 hours. On Friday afternoon it was
legitimate to speculate about a possible collapse of the negotiations
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, with potentially
devastating consequences for the entire movement towards a lasting
settlement. By yesterday afternoon not only had that fear receded, but the
momentum towards peace had gathered pace with the signing of a draft
agreement between Israel and Jordan.
The advocates of peace, and its enemies, will both probably have been
heartened by events. Hamas, the radical Palestinian faction, will have noted
how close it came to provoking Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister,
into breaking off talks with the PLO and forcing a bitter confrontation
among the Palestinian community.
Little suits Hamas better than being able to portray Mr Yassir Arafat, the
PLO chairman, as a tool of Israeli security policy in repressing Palestinian
national ambitions. By first staging a terror attack in the heart of
Jerusalem and then kidnapping an Israeli soldier, Hamas got the reaction
from Mr Rabin that it sought. The end to the kidnapping, tragic though it
was, would have been so much worse had Hamas been holding the soldier in
territory under the control of Mr Arafat's police.
The speed with which Mr Rabin announced the resumption of talks with the
PLO, suspended last week, on the holding of elections in the West Bank and
Gaza and the further redeployment of Israeli troops, suggests the Israeli
government is aware of how dangerously close the peace process had come to
breaking down. It was also fortuitous that negotiations with Jordan had
progressed to the point that Mr Rabin was able to head almost immediately to
Amman where he and King Hussein worked late into Sunday night to complete
their agreement.
King Hussein had signalled in June his intention to press ahead with
bilateral negotiations. Frustrated by the lack of co-ordination among his
Arab negotiating partners, and generally depressed about the political
health of the region, King Hussein said he had no option but to concentrate
on his own immediate interests. The Jordanians had been angered by the
behaviour of Mr Arafat, particularly over future links between the two
economies, and were being given little information by the Syrians on the
progress of their negotiations with Israel.
'We cannot wait any longer. We have to address the problems which relate to
the interests of this country,' said King Hussein.
This he has now done. In the process, the king has cemented his
rapprochement with the US after the breach caused by the Gulf war, and will
probably be successful in winning debt relief on some Dollars 2bn owed to
western governments. Simultaneously he has given Israel the satisfaction of
having picked off the third of the five Arab nations which had sworn to
remain forever united before the Zionist foe. Egypt, the Palestinians and
Jordan have all now signed separate deals. Only Syria and Lebanon remain.
On paper, the last stage should not present too formidable an obstacle. The
broad outline of an agreement is already well understood by all sides. Syria
requires Israel to withdraw totally from the Golan Heights, occupied in
1967. The Lebanese government, which will not act without Syria's blessing,
similarly wants Israel to quit territory in the south of its country. Israel
is demanding a full normalisation of relations.
The critical issue is over timing. Israel says it must have prior evidence
of the Syrian commitment to peace before it will begin a staged withdrawal,
which would only be completed over several years. The Syrians, of course,
want their land back first.
Given the deeply suspicious nature of Mr Rabin and President Hafez al-Assad
of Syria, it was to be expected that the mediation efforts of Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, would only edge forward slowly. But
US officials are confident progress is being made and the most optimistic
talk about a breakthrough before the end of the year. Nothing would provide
a greater blow to the ambitions of Middle East extremists than the sight of
Mr Assad and Mr Rabin shaking hands.

FT  18 OCT 94 / China air traffic accord with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
China and the US yesterday agreed to co-operate in converting the Chinese
military-dominated air traffic control system to civilian management under
an agreement signed by senior US and Chinese officials.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, and Mr Ding Henggao, minister of
the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence,
agreed to 'pursue preliminary co-operation in air traffic control systems
and technology'.
The signing follows the Sino-US decision earlier this year to establish a
Joint Defence Conversion Commission to provide a framework for co-operation
in transforming military industries to civilian use.
Mr Perry and his Chinese counterparts were seeking improved defence
co-operation as part of attempts to enhance Sino-US relations. Other issues
discussed by the US defence secretary and Chinese officials included human
rights, North Korea and non-proliferation of nuclear technology.
The US had identified air traffic control, exacerbated by confusion between
civilian and military controllers, as a priority because of China's poor
safety record.
At present China's military controls 90 per cent of the skies, with civilian
controllers playing a limited role.
US officials did not go into details, but the transformation of China's
chaotic air traffic control system will lead to greater involvement of US
companies in the building of a modern network.
Mr Perry arrived in China on Sunday at the start of a four-day visit aimed
at consolidating a recent improvement in Sino-US relations. But US officials
made it clear that an embargo on arms sales to China would be maintained.
Imposition of sanctions on sales of military equipment followed the bloody
events of 1989, when the military turned its guns on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing.
Chinese media hailed the visit, saying it marked the 'resumption of
high-level contacts between the two countries.' US officials expressed
satisfaction with the wide-ranging discussions, which included human rights
issues.
Mr Perry spent two hours in talks with General Chi Haotian, his Chinese
counterpart. These discussions will continue over the next few days.
Guy de Jonquieres, Business Editor, adds: Mr Richard Needham, Britain's
trade minister, has cancelled plans to visit three Chinese provinces this
month after being told by Beijing that his visit was 'inopportune.'
The move appears intended to underline Beijing's continuing anger at
political reforms in Hong Kong instituted by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's
governor. However, the Department of Trade and Industry in London was
playing down the significance of the incident. It said ministerial visits
were always subject to last-minute change and Mr Needham had known the visit
was not going ahead before he left for a Far East tour at the weekend.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Cornerstone for new Middle East: Israel and Jordan point the
way to regional economic changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Israel-Jordan peace treaty initialled in Amman yesterday is the most
important cornerstone yet of plans for a new Middle East marked by
Arab-Israeli trade, integration and regional economic development.
The geographical proximity of the two countries and the opportunities for
joint projects in energy, water, tourism and shared use of ports, airports
and roads will take the new Middle East beyond the drawing board.
The agreement comes two weeks before Arabs and Israelis are due to meet in
Casablanca at a conference to discuss an economic blueprint to cement peace
in the Middle East. On the Casablanca agenda are plans to form a regional
development bank, initially capitalised at Dollars 10bn, and to raise
finance for at least 150 private and public sector projects worth Dollars
25bn (Pounds 15.8bn) in investment over 10 years.
Furthermore, with a second Arab neighbour formally at peace with Israel,
economic relations with Egypt, a much larger economy than Jordan, should
increase after more than a decade of cold and cautious peace and minimal
trade.
'This is an enormously important piece of the economic puzzle,' Mr Ehud
Kaufman, senior Israeli economic negotiator, said yesterday. 'Jordan is a
trading country at the heart of the Middle East with western standards and a
desire to boost its economy.'
Economic negotiations between Israel and Jordan, backed by detailed plans,
are already well advanced and yesterday's agreement will allow for speedy
implementation of projects.
First on the agenda is the construction of dams on the Yarmouk and Jordan
rivers and a desalination plant at the Sea of Galilee. Under the peace
agreement, Israel has promised to raise the finance and, says one official,
the European Union has agreed to meet half the costs. There are hopes of
finance from the US-backed Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
The second most immediate development will be the wider opening of borders
to promote trade and tourism. A new border crossing at Bet Shean south of
the Sea of Galilee is expected to be opened early next month. The main aim
of the crossing, supported by an upgrading of roads, will be to give Jordan
access to the Israeli Mediterranean ports of Haifa and Ashdod.
The new crossing, combined with that opened two months ago between Aqaba and
Eilat, will also boost tourism. Once the agreement is formally signed,
Jordan is expected to lift the ban on Israeli passport holders crossing into
Jordan and to speed the movement of vehicles.
Israel last week transferred responsibility for a third crossing at the
Allenby bridge from the military to the ministry of transport and Jordan
abolished the requirements for special permits to cross the bridge.
In return for Jordanian access to Israel's ports, Israel is hoping for a
quick agreement for shared use of Jordan's huge Red Sea port at Aqaba to
gain easy access to markets in east Asia. Use of Aqaba would also allow
Israel to give scarce land in Eilat, currently used by its port, over to the
more profitable and booming Eilat tourism industry.
In trade, Mr Kaufman said yesterday, the agreement would allow Israeli
negotiators to move ahead quickly with a formal bilateral trade deal. Israel
has already granted Jordan a preferential trade concession worth Dollars 30m
a year for exports into the still Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Mr Kaufman said both sides were committed in principle to a free trade area
with the removal of customs barriers but first would conclude an agreed list
of products. While Israel would continue to give Jordan preferential trade
treatment to support its political courage, he said Israel now wanted a
formal agreement to 'underscore the fact that the trade boycotts and
barriers are removed formally and in practice'. Within a few years trade
could approach Dollars 1.5bn or Dollars 2bn, Mr Kaufman said.
Air links between the two states are also expected to be concluded within
weeks of the formal signing ceremony. Linking the electricity grids of
Israel and Jordan is already under way, starting with Eilat and Aqaba.
Jordan's Dollars 4.5bn economy is dwarfed by Israel's which last year had a
gross national product of Dollars 70bn. But the two countries, spurred by
the political commitment of their leaders to a new Middle East, are the most
likely to develop economic co-operation providing both a vital building
block and a model of economic transformation in the region.

Iraq's People's Assembly yesterday gathered for an extraordinary, secret
session to approve the recognition of United Nations-demarcated borders with
Kuwait and the Gulf state's sovereignty - a fundamental UN Security Council
precondition for any moves towards the easing of sanctions. The
hastily-called meeting was expected to deliver an official recognition of
Kuwait's sovereignty and borders in the terms required by this weekend's
Security Council resolution, which called on Iraq to make the recognition
through 'full and formal constitutional procedures'.

Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, flew to Oslo yesterday for
talks with Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, his Norwegian counterpart, as the two
leaders sought to capitalise on Finland's approval of European Union
membership in their own EU referendum campaigns.
Both Mr Carlsson, making his first trip outside Sweden since his Social
Democratic party won last month's general election, and Mrs Brundtland
welcomed the result of Sunday's Finnish vote and said it should help
persuade sceptical voters in Sweden and Norway to accept EU membership in
referendums due in the two countries on November 13 and 28 respectively.
Opposition in Sweden and Norway is more deeply entrenched than in Finland.
Mr Carlsson's own cabinet includes two prominent anti-EU campaigners. But he
said the Finnish vote undercut the argument from the no campaign that there
was a Nordic alternative to the EU. 'It would be striking for Sweden to be
outside the Union when Denmark and Finland are inside,' he said.
However, leaders of the strong anti-EU campaigns in both countries said the
Finnish result - a yes victory by 57 per cent to 43 per cent - was not as
decisive as had been expected and they pledged to continue their fight
against joining the Union. Despite the Finnish result, voters in Norway
appear to be maintaining their opposition. A poll published in Aftenposten,
Norway's leading newspaper, suggested that 51 per cent of the electorate was
against EU membership, an increase of six percentage points since September.
Those in favour accounted for 31 per cent, a decline of four percentage
points.
The Finnish vote meant two out of the four European Free Trade Association
applicants have now won referendums. Austria voted in June by an even
clearer margin than Finland.
The last hurdle in Finland before taking up membership on January 1 will be
a so-far unscheduled parliamentary vote. Under the Finnish constitution,
membership must be approved by a two-thirds majority, leading to some
concern that EU opponents might try to mount a last-ditch blocking effort.

Portugal's centre-right government yesterday presented to parliament a
moderately restrictive budget for 1995 that allows room for a high level of
European Union-financed investment in the approach to a general election
next October. Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the budget deficit
would be cut to 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product from an estimated 6.3
per cent this year. This would be achieved through increased revenue rather
than by spending cuts, consolidating a downward trend after a large overrun
in 1993. Overall revenue next year was forecast to grow by 7 per cent
compared with 1994, to Es3,649.2bn (Pounds 14.7bn). The central value added
tax rate would be raised from 16 to 17 per cent, but Mr Catroga said direct
tax would not rise as a percentage of GDP. Public spending would rise 5.2
per cent, above forecast 1995 inflation of 3.5-4.5 per cent, to Es4,380.8bn.

Mr Franco Ambrosio, the largest private grain trader in Italy, was arrested
yesterday in Naples on charges of being involved in illicit financing of
political parties. The charge related to a L7.5bn (Pounds 3m) payment made
in 1990 by the late Pietro Barilla, then a leading industrialist, which Mr
Ambrosio is alleged to have deposited in a Swiss bank account on behalf of
the Socialist party. The arrest was ordered by Milan magistrates as part of
their investigations into the secret use of accounts at the Clariden Bank,
Geneva, by the Socialist party, then headed by Mr Bettino Craxi. Mr
Ambrosio, dubbed 'the king of grain', has his trading base in Naples and he
is the biggest business figure in southern Italy. He has already been
arrested once in the past year on charges of alleged corruption, but this
related to investigations by Naples magistrates.

The four big public television shareholders in Euronews - Europe's attempted
answer to CNN of America - yesterday pledged to fund the satellite news
station for the next two years and to bring in private capital.
The French, Italian, Spanish and Swiss public television companies, which
together own about half of Euronews, promised to provide 'the necessary
funding' for the station to continue in 1995-96. Euronews has so far piled
up losses of FFr150m (Pounds 18m) in its first two years of transmitting
identical pictures in five different languages for 20 hours a day, despite a
FFr20m a year subsidy from the European parliament. Its main problem is that
despite a claimed audience in the tens of millions, through cable, satellite
and terrestial re-broadcast, it has failed to pull in much advertising.

Sweden's new Social Democrat industry minister, Mr Sten Heckscher, has said
two existing privatisation plans would continue but that he was less
enthusiastic about state asset sales than his conservative predecessor.
'Privatisation is not a religion for us,' he said in a weekend interview
with the business daily, Dagens Industri. The planned flotation of the bank,
Nordbanken, and the sale of more shares in the drugs maker, Pharmacia, would
continue. However, in Nordbanken's case, Mr Heckscher said there would be no
hurry to comply with the target of early 1995 set by the previous minister,
Mr Per Westerberg. Mr Heckscher said that he would consider some
privatisation of the national telecommunications company, Telia, 'but I am
convinced that the state must ensure it has a significant control over this
company in the foreseeable future'.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Finns see new era of prosperity in Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Finnish electorate's clear approval of the country's move to join the
European Union was welcomed yesterday by government and both sides of
industry who believe membership will cement Finland's recovery from the
deepest recession experienced by an industrialised country since the second
world war.
'EU membership is good for our economy,' said Mr Sixten Korkman, director
general of the finance ministry's economics department. 'It should help to
sustain the momentum of our recovery and help to bring down long-term
interest rates. Investment activity should benefit because there will be
more certainty about the rules of the game.' Mr Jarl Kohler, head of the
country's forestry industry association, said: 'This means a lot for
(Finnish) industry, especially for the forestry industry.'
Finland's economy is already rebounding from a recession that between 1990
and late 1993 saw output shrink by some 15 per cent, the deepest slump in
any member of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development in
the post-war period.
Loss of vital trade with the neighbouring Soviet Union, the bursting of a
huge 1980s credit boom, the international recession and the burden of a big
welfare system combined to throw the economy violently into reverse, driving
up unemployment to almost 20 per cent of the workforce. This year an
export-led recovery has taken hold, with the country's big forestry industry
and companies such as Nokia, the telecommunications group, benefiting from
renewed international demand and the low value of the Finnish Markka, which
is about 20 per cent below its 1991 level against a basket of currencies.
Gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 4 per cent this year and
by at least 5 per cent in 1995.
Finnish political and business leaders have been careful not to portray EU
membership as a magic formula for greater growth. Although Finnish exports
will no longer be subject to EU customs duties, most of the other direct
trading benefits of membership are already available through Finland's
membership of the European Economic Area.
Mainly because of the extra costs of cushioning Finland's highly subsidised
agriculture from the adjustment to lower EU producer prices, EU membership
will add a net FM10bn (Pounds 1.25bn) in costs to the government's budget in
1995. This will help push up state debt set to the equivalent of 70 per cent
of GDP next year and prolong the struggle to bring the budget deficit to
within the EU's Maastricht criteria for European monetary union.
But the benefits of membership are expected to flow in other ways. Lower
agricultural prices will further dampen annual inflation, already running at
a lowly 2 per cent. Yesterday, long-term interest rates continued the
downward path they have been following since opinion polls began forecasting
a firm Yes vote in the referendum. Yields on 10-year government bonds stood
at around 10 per cent, down from a peak of around 11.5 per cent in
mid-August. The Markka also strengthened in another sign of market
confidence.
The hope is that such trends will boost investment - which is vital to
sustain the ambitious levels of growth needed to make significant inroads on
unemployment. A recent presidential commission on unemployment said annual
growth of 5 per cent was required up to the end of the decade just to get
unemployment down to 8 per cent from the present level of 18 per cent.
Finnish officials are also hoping that being in the EU will encourage
foreign investors to look more seriously at Finland, which only abolished
its last restrictions on foreign ownership of Finnish companies at the end
of 1992. Since then there has been a flood of foreign buying of shares in
Finnish companies, but little direct foreign investment in the country.
In the drive to attract inward investment, the new Invest in Finland bureau,
set up by the government, is stressing the location of the country as a
gateway to trading with Russia, with which Finland shares a 1,270km-long
border and a long history of trading ties.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Economic Digest: Swedish unemployment falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment in Sweden fell last month in line with a trend of gradual
improvement in the economy, but the numbers out of work remain at
historically high levels. Those without work or places in government
training programmes totalled 346,000, or 8.1 per cent of the workforce, in
September, down from 8.8 per cent in August and below the figure of 8.7 per
cent a year ago. Although an export-led recovery has created many jobs, much
of the fall in unemployment in September was due to a rise in the number in
training schemes by 40,000 to 289,000.
The number of jobless in Poland fell to 16.5 per cent in September from 16.8
per cent in August, but it was up from 15.4 per cent a year ago.
Hungary's monthly consumer price index rose 2.3 per cent in September, up
from 1.4 per cent in August, making it 18.9 per cent higher than a year ago.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Brussels to look deeper into Italtel venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The structure of Italy's state-controlled telecommunications sector is to
come under European Commission scrutiny as part of an antitrust
investigation into the proposed joint venture between Italtel, Italy's
telecoms equipment manufacturer, and Siemens of Germany.
The Commission yesterday announced it was deepening its investigation into
the deal struck in March between Stet, the state-controlled holding company
which is Italtel's parent, and Siemens.
The two companies agreed to merge their equipment manufacturing interests in
Italy. Stet and Siemens would each control 50 per cent of the new company,
which would have a turnover of about L3,400bn (Dollars 2.2bn) in 1994.
The Brussels inquiry, which follows a one-month preliminary examination of
the case, could last up to four months. It is thus likely to overlap with
the build-up to privatisation of the Italian state's 65 per cent holding in
Stet, expected to take place in the middle of 1995.
The Commission said it was concerned about the impact of the Italtel-Siemens
deal on the Italian market for the supply of telecoms switching and exchange
equipment in the state sector. It said the joint venture would command
around half the Italian market for public switching and transmission
equipment.
But Brussels is also worried about vertical links between Italtel/Siemens
and Telecom Italia, Italy's main domestic telephone company. Telecom Italia,
which is Italtel's principal client, is also a subsidiary of Stet. 'One of
our concerns is that one of the main EU companies, Siemens, will have the
same status (within Stet) as Italtel, which has a very important
relationship with Telecom Italia,' the Commission said yesterday.
The announcement of an in-depth inquiry was not unexpected, given that
Italtel already had nearly 50 per cent of the Italian equipment market
before the merger. But it is the second antitrust setback this month for
Stet and Telecom Italia.
Last week, a Milan appeal court ruled that Telecom Italia would have to
provide more leased lines for Telsystem - an Italian telecoms services
company that wants to provide telecoms services for businesses in Italy  -
pending a ruling by Italy's antitrust authority.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Arrest warrant issued for Spanish financier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An arrest warrant was issued yesterday for Mr Javier de la Rosa, the
Barcelona-based financier who in the 1980s became a symbol of the then
booming Spanish economy as he orchestrated a major investment drive by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) into the country.
The chief prosecutor of Catalonia's supreme court in Barcelona, Mr Carlos
Jimenez Villarejo, said that the arrest had been ordered on counts of fraud,
misappropriation of public funds and falsification of legal documents in
connection with Mr de la Rosa's loss-making holding company Gran Tibidabo
and that he would oppose bail.
Mr de la Rosa is accused of rerouting towards other businesses in his
holding Pta1bn (Pounds 4.96m) of a Pta10bn credit, guaranteed by Catalonia's
Generalitat government, that he obtained in order to develop a theme park
south of Barcelona. Earlier this year Mr de la Rosa sold his interests in
the theme park to a consortium headed by the UK's Tussauds Group, part of
Pearson, owners of the Financial Times.
Mr de la Rosa, who was on a hunting trip in central Spain when the warrant
was issued, meanwhile told a radio station that he was travelling back to
Barcelona to present himself to the court but that he could not 'understand
what all the fuss was about'.
The arrest order has shaken the domestic financial establishment, which had
viewed Mr de la Rosa's rapid creation of one of Spain's biggest private
fortunes with a mix of awe and envy.
'A lot of people considered de la Rosa an upstart and had it in for him but
the general belief was he would get away with it; now they are thinking
again,' said a Madrid broker.
The development is seen as part of a wider judicial movement against the
self-made multi-millionaires of the late 1980s that has already targeted Mr
Mario Conde, who was removed as chairman of Banesto, one of the leading
domestic banks, at the end of last year and Mr Manuel de la Concha, a former
head of the Madrid stock exchange who was held briefly in prison earlier
this year in connection with the collapse of a private banking empire he had
created.
The move against Mr de la Rosa is also likely to have an embarrassing
knock-on effect in Catalan political circles as his meteoric business career
had been consistently backed by the local nationalist party as an example of
Catalonian enterprise. Prosecutor Jimenez Villarejo hinted yesterday that
the judicial investigation into Mr de la Rosa's affairs could extend to
local politicians.
Mr de la Rosa lost executive responsibilities at Grupo Torras, the KIO's
investment arm in Spain, in a 1992 management shake-up and came under
further pressure at a stormy shareholder meeting of his Gran Tibidabo
holding in June after a revised audit declared losses of Pta11bn last year
in place of profits of Pta16m.
Separately, the Barcelona financier, along with other former KIO executives,
is being sued in Madrid and London by the Office's present board over
alleged losses of Pta500bn that forced Grupo Torras into receivership two
years ago.

Portugal's centre-right government yesterday presented to parliament a
moderately restrictive budget for 1995 that allows room for a high level of
European Union-financed investment in the approach to a general election
next October.
Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the budget deficit would be cut
to 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product from an estimated 6.3 per cent
this year. The reduction is to be achieved through increased revenue rather
than by spending cuts.
Portugal aims to consolidate a downward trend for the budget deficit after a
large budget overrun in 1993 when the deficit jumped to 7.1 per cent of GDP.
The original target for 1994 was 6.9 per cent but has been lowered as a
result of higher than expected tax revenue.
Overall revenue next year is forecast to grow by 7 per cent compared with
1994, to Es3,649.2bn (Pounds 14.7bn). The central value added tax rate is to
be raised from 16 to 17 per cent. But Mr Catroga said the direct tax burden
would not increase as a percentage of GDP.
Public spending is to rise 5.2 per cent, above forecast 1995 inflation of
3.5-4.5 per cent, to Es4,380.8bn. But Mr Catroga said the increase in
current spending would be lower than the inflation rate. Public investment
is to rise by 15 per cent, largely due to national budget contributions to
EU-financed projects.
The government aims to stimulate economic recovery in the run-up to the
election. GDP growth resumed in mid-1994 after two years of recession and is
expected to reach 1.1 per cent this year. Mr Catroga forecast the economy
would expand by 2.5-3.5 per cent in 1995.
But Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, is also concerned to meet
targets for nominal convergence with the EU, particularly now that the
possibility of a multi-speed Europe has been raised by politicians in
Germany and France.
Failure to cut public debt, inflation and interest rates would hinder
Portugal's participation in economic and monetary union. The 1995 budget
deficit target Mr Catroga announced yesterday is equal to that earlier
suggested by the European Commission.
'If we lose the battle to reduce the budget deficit, Portugal will forfeit
the political weight required to defend its interests within the European
Union,' Mr Cavaco Silva warned at the weekend.
He was talking to trade unionists after the collapse of efforts to forge a
1995 wage pact between government, employers and unions.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Poll called to end Bulgaria crisis: Six-week row over
cabinet prompts president's action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Bulgarian president, Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, yesterday ended a six-week-long
cabinet crisis by dissolving parliament and appointing Ms Reneta Indjova to
lead an interim government until early general elections on December 18.
Ms Indjova, a tough-minded, 41-year-old economist who helped to draw up the
economic programme of the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF),
is the first woman premier in this Balkan country's political history.
Early elections were made inevitable by the refusal of the two biggest
parliamentary groups, the Bulgarian Socialist party (BSP) and the UDF to try
to form a government to replace the non-party government of technocrats
headed by Mr Lyuben Berov.
Mr Berov, who survived a severe heart attack in March and six no-confidence
votes over the past 12 months, resigned on September 2 after successfully
concluding negotiations for a reduction of Bulgaria's Dollars 9.3bn foreign
debt and a strategically important oil pipeline deal with Russia.
His government, which was supported by Socialist party votes and a handful
of breakaway groups from the UDF, was never forgiven by the UDF which won
the October 1991 elections but resigned and was replaced after only a year
in office by Mr Berov. This followed a no-confidence vote in Mr Philip
Dimitrov, the then UDF prime minister.
The UDF saw the government as a front for the BSP with its roots in the
communist past and continued to press for early elections. This is in spite
of the fact that opinion polls indicate that the BSP is likely to emerge
from elections as the largest party, albeit without an absolute majority.
The government was also held responsible for the emergence of a new class of
businessmen who made quick profits from the illegal, or so-called 'shadow',
privatisation of state or municipally owned assets.
Breaking the United Nations-imposed embargo on neighbouring Serbia and the
Greek blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia also made
millionaires out of smugglers and led to widespread bribery of poorly paid
officials and policemen, undermining public morale.
Sensitive to such complaints, President Zhelev appealed to Ms Indjova to
declare war on crime and to clear the administration of people with
Mafia-type connections.
Critics also blame the slow pace of privatisation for the lack of
transparency which has encouraged the enrichment of former communist
officials.
The outcome of the elections will be closely watched both by potential
western and Russian investors who are looking for a government capable of
improving the bureaucratic system and creating the institutional and legal
framework needed to sustain several planned large infrastructure and
industrial projects. The most important is a Dollars 700m oil pipeline, to
be financed largely by Russian oil companies and Greek banking and shipping
companies.
The pipeline will run from Burgas to the northern Greek port of
Alexandroupolis, by-passing the congested Bosporus. It will strengthen the
hand of Russia which is determined to maintain a stranglehold over future
exports of oil and gas from the entire Caspian region by ensuring that
future regional pipelines converge on its own Black Sea port of Novorossiysk
before transshipment to Burgas and on to the Aegean sea.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Rouble probe says fears caused fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The official investigation into the reasons for the more than 20 per cent
fall in the value of the Russian rouble last week points to fears about the
underlying weakness of the economy and not to subversive or criminal
manipulation of the market, as senior Russian officials, including President
Boris Yeltsin, initially suggested.
Mr Mikhail Zadornov, a member of a special investigation into the currency
collapse, said yesterday that rising inflation, lower bank interest rates, a
new tax on bank deposits and a presidential decree ordering all transactions
of more than Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 6,329) to be reported to the tax police
came together to produce a flight from the rouble. The probe is being led by
Mr Oleg Lobov, the secretary of the Security Council, which reports to Mr
Yeltsin on matters of national security.
The immediate cause of the rouble run, said Mr Zadornov, was 'weak
co-ordination' between the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. He said
the bank, which had drawn heavily on hard currency reserves which stood at
only Dollars 5bn on August 1 during trading in August and September, had
ceased to intervene last week and precipitated the crash.
The findings of a report by the commission investigating the currency fall,
which has not yet been officially released, was confirmed yesterday by
leading Moscow bankers. Mr Vladimir Vinogradov, president of Inkombank, said
yesterday that a lack of financial products in which money could be invested
 -apart from short-term Treasury bills - meant that fears of inflation and
the drop in interest rates sent investors fleeing from the rouble into the
dollar.
'Why can't the Central Bank develop a range of products as others are
learning to do?' asked Mr Vinogradov. Fears of a further sharp fall in the
rouble in trading yesterday were not fulfilled. The Russian currency fell by
only eight points to end the day at Rbs2996 to the dollar. The currency fell
to Rbs4000 to the dollar on 'Black Tuesday' last week, to recover after bank
intervention to Rbs2888 last Friday.
There is, however, less unanimity on the successor to Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman who resigned after what was said to
be a frosty meeting with Mr Yeltsin last Friday - or even if his resignation
is constitutionally in order.
Mr Zadornov, chairman of the parliament's budget committee, said his
committee believed the resignation, accepted by Mr Yeltsin, should be
debated by parliament and suggested that Mr Gerashchenko should be
re-appointed acting chairman until another candidate is found.
Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, head of the Most financial group and vice-president of
the Association of Russian Banks, said that the chairman 'must be a
professional, not a macroeconomist' - a comment which indicated that the
bank chiefs are against the appointment of either Mr Boris Fyodorov, the
former finance minister, or Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister.
The NTV independent TV channel - which Mr Gusinsky owns - reported on Sunday
that Mr Gaidar would be appointed as head of the bank. However, his office
said yesterday that Mr Gaidar would make no comment.
Mr Fyodorov said that the rouble's fall was engineered by the Finance
Ministry and the Central Bank to 'patch up the holes in the budget' by
artificially lowering the rate of the rouble. He said the incident showed
that the government had no defined economic policy and that there was
'insufficient political will' to continue economic reforms.

FT  18 OCT 94 / German Elections: SPD leader unbowed after defeat in German
polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Rudolf Scharping was sitting relatively pretty as the dust settled
yesterday on one of Germany's closest election results in years. And he
seemed content to sit tight. Looking slightly more relaxed than during
pre-election encounters with the press, the leader of the Social Democratic
party (SPD) said he would give the government no quarter over the next four
years. 'Nothing will get done without the Social Democrats,' he said.
True, Mr Scharping has not managed to unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl and many
party members, exasperated by 12 years of Mr Kohl, were obviously
disappointed.
He had also not fought the most inspiring election campaign, allowing a lead
of several percentage points in the spring to be turned into a 5.1 point
bonus for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister
party, the Christian Social Union.
He did, however, manage to improve on the party's dismal performance in 1990
when it won just 33.5 per cent. The odds were also against him: no modern
German government has fallen at the elections; they have collapsed mid-term
with the break-up of the governing coalition. Had Mr Scharping made it, he
would also have been the first state premier to manage the leap from a
provincial capital directly to the chancellor's office in Bonn.
Most importantly, party members and outside observers were agreed that Mr
Scharping had emerged from Sunday's vote unchallenged as the party's leader.
For the time being at least he has fended off a challenge from Mr Gerhard
Schroder, the ambitious state premier of Lower Saxony, whose differences
with Mr Scharping had several times caused confusion in SPD ranks.
Once again, though, it seems Mr Schroder will have to play second fiddle. Mr
Scharping denied any prospects of a grand coalition and seemed content
yesterday to sit out Mr Kohl's new and weaker coalition and wait his turn.
That could happen in two ways. The Free Democratic party (FDP), the small
liberal party which has been in coalition with the CDU since 1982, might
decide in the next few years to transfer its allegiance and support the SPD,
reversing the move it made 12 years ago when it caused the collapse of the
then SPD government.
A more plausible, though still distant, possibility is that the CDU and SPD
move closer together over the next four years if it becomes apparent that Mr
Kohl's new 10-seat government majority is becoming untenable.
Such a grand coalition does in practice already exist. Mr Kohl has a
majority of just 10 seats in the Bundestag, while the SPD controls just over
60 per cent of the votes in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber which
represents Germany's 16 Lander, and which approves all Bundestag
legislation.
The parallels with Mr Kohl bode well for Mr Scharping's future. Both were
state premiers of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the wine-growing southwestern
German state.
Now Mr Scharping hopes that he will today be endorsed as the leader of the
SPD's parliamentary party aged 46, as Chancellor Kohl was when he took over
his party in Bonn in 1976. Mr Kohl had to wait just six years before he
managed to move from parliament into the chancellor's office.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Job cuts spark strike at Skoda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ten thousand workers at Skoda Automobilova, the Czech carmaker that is part
of the Volkswagen group, staged a half-hour warning strike yesterday over
plans to make 800 employees redundant by the end of the year. More stoppages
are threatened.
The dispute risks disrupting the launch next month of Skoda's Felicia model,
its first new product since 1988. It could also rebound on VW's delicate
talks with the government on increasing its stake.
Skoda says the job losses, announced last month, are necessary to increase
competitiveness and it has hinted at more next year. The company employs
17,000 people.
Union representatives insist, however, that wages are lower and productivity
higher at Skoda's Mlada Boleslav plant north of Prague than in European
Union countries.
Volkswagen's 31 per cent of Skoda is due to rise to 70 per cent under a 1991
agreement with the government, at a total cost of DM1.4bn. VW also agreed to
invest DM8bn, but it announced last year that it would cut this to DM3.75bn
after running up huge losses at its Seat subsidiary in Spain.
The original investment envisaged production levels of 400,000 cars yearly
at Skoda by 1997, but this is expected to be changed to about 300,000 by the
end of the decade.
Production has fallen steeply this year as the company's old Favorit model
has been phased out and new assembly plants installed to produce the
Felicia. Overall production is expected to dip to 180,000 this year from
220,000 last year, but Skoda says it should rise to 1993 levels again next
year.
Skoda lost Kcs4.26bn (Dollars 154m) last year on revenues of Kcs35bn, and
further losses are expected again this year.
Volkswagen and the government are discussing an addendum to the 1991
agreement under which the carmaker would commit itself to production,
employment and investment targets. The talks are due to be completed by the
end of this month. Even at its reduced level Volkswagen's investment is the
biggest in the Czech Republic to date. Hostility to foreign investment is
growing, however, as the Skoda investment and other high-profile deals, such
as that of Air France in Czechoslovak Airlines, begin to run into problems.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Competitive role for mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mobile phone companies could play a critical role in boosting competition
across Europe's telecommunications industry as existing monopolies are
abolished, the European Commission believes.
Mr Leo Koolen, a senior Commission official, told a Financial Times
conference on mobile communications in London yesterday that mobile phone
operators would be well placed to com-pete with existing 'fixed-wire'
operators when the monopoly of national phone companies over basic phone
calls is abolished in 1998.
Commission projections show the number of mobile telephone subscribers in
Europe rising from about 12m - three times the level of three years ago - to
at least 40m by 2000 and 80m by 2010.
'We believe that the mobile and personal communications sector has the
potential to grow to a size equivalent to the present fixed-wire sector in
just one and a half decades,' said Mr Koolen.
The mobile communications sector has been opened to competition across the
European Union. Within the past two years industrial groups such as
Mannesmann in Germany and Bouygues in France, with no previous telecoms
business, have taken significant stakes in the cellular market, in
competition with established operators Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom
and
As a first stage in opening up fixed-wire telecoms networks to competition,
the Commission wants mobile operators to be allowed to build their own fixed
links as a means of reducing their reliance on existing monopoly networks.
This will be covered by a green paper on telecoms infrastructure
liberalisation, to be published early next year.
However, Mr Koolen said the Commission also envisaged mobile operators
competing head-on with fixed-wire companies once the latter's monopoly over
basic voice telephony is abolished in 1998.
In the UK - the EU's most open telecoms market - Mercury Communications, the
main competitor to the former monopoly British Telecommunications, is a
significant operator in both the mobile and fixed-wire markets.
The Commission believes a similar pattern could develop across the EU as
liberalisation advances.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Financial markets show their approval
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
German financial markets opened yesterday with a positive reaction to the
election result, but profit-taking and concern over the sharp cut in the
government's majority left share prices slightly lower.
Initially, the Frankfurt stock exchange gained nearly 2 per cent, measured
by the DAX-index of 30 leading shares, later easing to close 0.7 per cent
down at 2,091 points.
Markets had already shifted last week from pessimism about a possible defeat
for Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the expectation of a victory for the coalition
his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leads. Thus the vote's outcome had been
discounted, with the DAX up by 7.4 per cent over the week.
The stock market also failed to draw any benefit from yesterday's firmer
bond market, where prices continued last week's gains. Traders said higher
bond prices reflected the strength of the D-Mark which yesterday stood at
around DM1.50 against the dollar, a two-year high.
Although the coalition's majority fell from 134 to 10, economists felt
investors would be encouraged by the re-election of Mr Kohl's government,
committed to making Germany more competitive through deregulation,
privatisation and debt-cutting.
'The good news is that the government can continue,' said Mr Norbert Braems,
Frankfurt-based economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. But, he added: 'The
narrow majority does not make politics easier.'
The first test would be the next budget; the government intends to
reintroduce an income tax surcharge to help pay for east German
reconstruction. The opposition would be strong, he said, particularly
because of the Social Democrats' increased majority in the upper house, the
Bundesrat - which can hinder legislation - thanks to its performance in
Sunday's regional state elections.
Economists said the Bundesbank would watch to see how decisively the
government held back public spending. The bank has been concerned about the
inflationary consequences of the cost of rebuilding east Germany.
Yesterday's September wholesale price figures for west Germany, with a rise
of 2.8 per cent on the year against 2.2 per cent in August, showed
inflationary tendencies persist.
The Bundesbank reported on a favourable trend in federal finances in its
monthly report, however. It said the government had cash reserves of some
DM11bn as a result of its capital-raising late last year. The federal cash
deficit fell to DM15.3bn in the first nine months from DM38.7bn in the same
period of 1993, partly as a result of a higher profit from the Bundesbank.

FT  18 OCT 94 / 'Overhang mandates' help swell Kohl's majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrat coalition, which in
the early hours of the federal count had its slender majority reduced to
two, managed to increase it by eight because of the 'overhang mandates', a
peculiarity of the German political system. The opposition Social Democrats
gained four extra seats in this way, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The system works as follows. If a party gains more seats on the first vote
(for directly-elected individual constituency seats) than its share based on
the second vote (for the party) then the number of seats is increased by the
difference. These are known as 'overhang mandates'. This is done on a
state-to-state basis.
For example, in the case of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the CDU won seven of the
nine constituencies. In the second vote, it was allocated five seats. This
number reflects the state's share of the overall federal CDU party vote,
which was just over 34 per cent, the equivalent of 232 seats.
But since the number of seats the CDU won on the constituency level exceeded
by two the number of seats available to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern CDU on
the federal party list, the party still retains the right to send the seven
directly-elected deputies. The extra two are known as overhang votes.
Through the overhang mandate system, the CDU won extra seats in several
other constituencies, which helped boost Mr Kohl's majority. These include
two overhang mandates in Baden-Wurttemburg, two in Saxony-Anhalt, three in
Thuringia and three in Saxony. The outgoing Bundestag had six such overhang
mandates. The incoming one will have 16.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Election boost poses dilemma for east German party: The PDS
must decide whether to widen its horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the Party of Democratic Socialism, successor to east Germany's
former Communist party, had much to smile about yesterday. They had won four
constituencies in east Berlin, gained 4.4 per cent of the national vote, and
will have 30 deputies in lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.
'Against all the odds, including the anti-PDS propaganda in the media, we
have proved we are a genuine left-wing party for the east Germans,' said Mr
Gregor Gysi, its charismatic parliamentary leader. Ironically, however, the
very success has exposed the party's weaknesses as it tries to define its
role in the Bundestag, and what kind of party it wants to become.
Ms Christa Luft, economics minister in the last Communist government in East
Germany who was elected for the PDS in east Berlin, said she would lobby
hard for east German interests. 'We have to have a new policy for the east
German Mittelstand (small and medium-sized companies). They require capital
and financial assistance.'
Mr Manfred Muller, a former banker who was also elected, wants a new housing
policy for the east Germans. But Mr Gysi admitted it was too early to say
what impact the PDS would have on the Bundestag.
One thing seems certain, however. The PDS will be working closely with the
Greens and the Social Democrats to promote east German interests, and to
dispel the persistent image in western Germany that it is at heart either
still communist, or merely an ephemeral 'protest' one.
To achieve the latter, the PDS knows it has to confront three issues: its
membership structure; whether it will remain a regionally-based party for
the east Germans, akin to Bavaria's Christian Social Union; and if it can
isolate the Communist Platform, its influential Leninist faction.
The party's voting structure is already changing. Although 90 per cent of
members are former communists, this does not reflect its vote Mr Andre Brie,
the campaign manager, and Infas, the independent polling organisation, have
shown that more than 20 per cent of PDS voters are under 25 - too young to
have any meaningful communist background. However, more than 30 per cent are
unemployed. 'This vote will erode over time,' said Mr Brie, adding that it
would be strategically unwise for the party to rely on this protest vote.
'When the economy picks up, peoples' voting habits will change.'
The PDS will thus have to decide if it will remain a party for east Germans
in the expectation that they will retain an identity, and interests,
separate from west Germans', or should move into the western states - the
party has already captured 5 per cent of the vote in the radical Kreuzberg
district of west Berlin.
'We want to get a foot in the west and be seen as the alternative left-wing
party,' said Mr Lothar Bisky, PDS leader. That carries a risk. Were the PDS
to go nationwide, it could split the left-wing vote in the west - to the
advantage of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.
But these problems pale in comparison to the task the party faces in shaking
off its communist legacy so that it can move towards becoming, at least in
east Germany, a genuine east German social democratic party. If it wants to
woo SPD votes in the east, and later in the west, it knows it must expel the
Communist Platform.
Achieving this would remove the charge that the PDS is a mere front for
communists. East Germany's SPD state and local governments might also find
it ideologically more acceptable to work with. A 'purge', though, would
deprive the party of a vital and disciplined grassroots element which helped
increase its influence in all five east German states. 'But it is a showdown
we have to have,' said Mr Bisky. 'And we have to address these issues very
soon.'

FT  18 OCT 94 / US and N Korea reach deal on nuclear programme
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US last night announced that it had reached a framework agreement with
North Korea to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme which
had threatened to destabilise the Korean peninsular.
Mr Robert Gallucci, head of the US delegation at the Geneva talks, said that
subject to approval by both governments, he and Mr Kang Sok-ju, his North
Korean counterpart, would return to Geneva on Friday to sign the 'framework
document'. Mr Gallucci said he was recommending that Washington sign the
deal.
Mr Gallucci gave no details of the document's contents but said it addressed
concerns about North Korea's past, present and future nuclear activ-ities.
'It's a good agreement,' he said. It served the interests of the US, South
Korea, Japan and other countries in the region and he believed the accord
would be broadly supported.
Under an outline accord reached in August, the US offered to help North
Korea switch from graphite-moderated to light-water nuclear reactors which
produce less plutonium, and to establish diplomatic ties, provided North
Korea agreed to freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full
international inspections of its nuclear facilities.
This included inspection of two undeclared suspect nuclear waste dumps which
could provide clues on whether Pyongyang has diverted plutonium to make one
or two atomic bombs. North Korea, which denies having a nuclear weapons
programme, has so far consistently rej-ected inspection of these sites.
Other key issues in the talks, which began on September 23, included the
financing and organisation of the light-water reactor programme, what to do
about 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a holding pond at the Yongbyon
nuclear complex north of Pyongyang, and the resumption of high-level talks
between North and South Korea.
Mr Gallucci admitted the deal was 'fairly complex'.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Delays at Eurotunnel may cause problems with banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the debt-burdened Channel tunnel operator, yesterday said delays
to the start of rail services had seriously dented its revenues this year,
and could prevent it from meeting conditions for Pounds 700m of fresh
borrowing.
The Anglo-French group had forecast revenues of Pounds 135m when it launched
its Pounds 858m rights issue in May, but yesterday it said it would not earn
a quarter of that by the year end.
'We have had a grim and very hard nine months and we have not delivered all
the expectations in our (rights issue) prospectus,' said Sir Alastair
Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman. 'But we believe we're are getting into a
position of delivering the goods.'
The news disappointed city analysts, who had been expecting Eurotunnel to
make revenues of more than Pounds 90m. The shares slid 7p to 221p -
compounding a 20p fall last week.
Healthy revenue forecasts earlier this year helped persuade the group's
syndicate of 220 banks to offer Pounds 700m of senior bank debt as part of a
Pounds 1.6bn refinancing.
Eurotunnel may now have to renegotiate the terms of the new debt, which was
due to provide working capital during its first full year of operations.
However, the so-called agent banks co-ordinating the lending syndicate -
including National Westminster and Midland - remain supportive and are not
expected to force a cash crisis ahead of next year's peak holiday season.
Mr Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, said: 'There is no
actual or potential breach of our loan covenants, let alone a default.'
Sir Alastair, meanwhile, denied there was any need for another rights issue
to boost finances.
Next year, Eurotunnel hopes to raise Pounds 200m from warrant holders
exercising rights over shares at roughly Pounds 3 each. Analysts are
sceptical that the share price will revive sufficiently.
Concern over the company's financial health mounted after it reported
sharply increased first-half losses of Pounds 47m, against Pounds 1m last
time.
The company has enjoyed some cost savings following the delay to rail
services. Sir Alistair said the deterioration would be limited in its
year-end cashflow postion to Pounds 50m worse than forecast.
The gloomy revenue picture was brightened slightly by the announcement of
the start of high-speed Eurostar passenger services from November 14.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Samsung to invest Pounds 450m in UK: North-east factory will
create 3,000 jobs - S Koreans reject rival EU sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Samsung of South Korea, the world's 14th largest industrial group, is to
invest Pounds 450m to build a manufacturing plant at Wynyard, Cleveland, in
the north-east of England.
The factory, which will produce consumer goods ranging from microwave ovens
to computer monitors for the European market, will eventually create 3,000
jobs and provide a considerable psychological boost for a region where high
unemployment seems endemic.
The Korean company also plans to move its European headquarters from
Frankfurt to London as part of the deal. The investment was unveiled
yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, during a
visit to Seoul. He said Samsung was attracted to the UK because of
'competitive wage rates without the social charter'.
Mr John Bridge, chief executive of the Northern Development Company, the
inward investment and economic regeneration agency for north-east England
and Cumbria, said he believed Samsung's presence would stimulate investment
from other companies in related activities such as plastic injection
moulding, metal casing manufacture and wiring systems production.
Samsung's plan is the latest in a series of large investments in the UK by
foreign companies. Last month NEC, the Japanese electronics giant, said it
intended to spend Pounds 530m to build a semiconductor manufacturing plant
at Livingston, near Edinburgh.
The UK government offered Samsung Pounds 58m in regional grants and loans to
secure the project. Together with indirect aid, the support is equivalent to
20 per cent of Samsung's investment.
Samsung's decision follows stiff competition from other European countries,
including Spain, where it has manufactures television and video recorders,
Portugal, France and Germany. The Cleveland investment dwarfs other Korean
investments in the European Union.
Mr Chan Bea, managing director of Samsung's UK operations, said the decision
had been influenced by the proximity of Cleveland to Scotland's 'Silicon
Glen' where a large number of computer manufacturers, potential customers
for Samsung's electronics products, are located.
He said the move was part of Samsung's globalisation strategy and a move
against possible anti-dumping measures by the EU.
Samsung intends initially to manufacture 1.3m microwave ovens and 1m
computer monitors annually at the Cleveland site. It will add production
facilities for personal computers, facsimile machines, colour display tubes
and semiconductors. The plant should be completed by 1999 when it should be
generating Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) in turnover, about half the group's
total European sales.
Samsung manufactures a broad range of products, from semiconductors and
personal computers to ships, petrochemicals and medical equipment.
Samsung Electronics was established in the UK in 1969. It makes 700,000
televisions a year in Teesside, and earlier this year, supported by the
Department of Trade and Industry, agreed to invest Pounds 11m over three
years in the plant.

FT  18 OCT 94 / Renault valued at Pounds 5bn for launch of partial sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The French government will today launch the partial privatisation of
Renault, the motor group that is one of the most attractive assets in the
country's public sector and a former bastion of union power.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, gave a guideline price of between
FFr163 and FFr178 per share for institutional investors, valuing the company
at FFr39bn to FFr42.5bn (Pounds 4.7bn to Pounds 5.1bn). The price range,
which officials described as non-binding, is below many market estimates
which have been between FFr42bn and FFr45bn.
Mr Alphandery described the partial privatisation, which is expected within
the next month, as an important step for the motor group and for French
financial markets.
The issue is being aimed mainly at individual investors, who will be able to
make non-binding applications for shares from today. Mr Alphandery said the
government planned to sell about 60 per cent of the shares to individuals,
but the proportion could be increased to two-thirds if demand was strong.
Previous issues in the French government's privatisation programme have seen
shares clawed back from institutional investors following strong
subscriptions by individuals. Industry observers in Paris predicted that
Renault would also see keen interest.
'It is a household name and seems likely to be fairly priced,' said a motor
industry analyst at a French merchant bank. He added that Renault, which
achieved profits of FF1.07bn last year and forecasts a strong increase in
1994, was one of the few motor groups to remain in profit during the
recession in the industry in 1992 and 1993.
Mr Alphandery stressed that the company would remain in French hands and
that the government, which holds 80 per cent of Renault's shares, would
retain a 51 per cent stake. 'Privatisation is not on the agenda,' he said.
As part of the operation, Volvo of Sweden, Renault's former partner in an
aborted merger, will sell between 8 per cent and 12 per cent of the French
company's shares. It holds 20 per cent.
Mr Alphandery said foreign shareholders would be welcome. However, a UK
retail broker said that foreign individuals might find it hard to obtain
shares.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Milan bourse sets date for
launch of futures contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Milan stock exchange intends to launch its long-awaited futures
contract, based on the new MIB 30 index of leading Italian shares, on
November 28.
On the same day, the exchange will extend the close of share trading from
4pm to 5pm, and end the distinction between shares which can be traded only
in the afternoon session and larger stocks which can be bought and sold
throughout the day.
Mr Ettore Fumagalli, a member of the exchange council, confirmed the launch
date on Friday, although he added that it could be postponed until December
2, if necessary.
'I think we will have a flat phase at the beginning (of futures trading),
with a limited number of contracts traded, but then I think we will have a
real take-off,' he told journalists.
The Milan stock exchange has been working hard to compete with other
European exchanges, and to attract Italy's small investors, who have
traditionally preferred to place their savings in government bonds.
Today, the exchange is launching a regulated system for trading in small
quantities of shares, which fall below the threshold for on-screen trading.
'To be complete, this has to be a market which allows everyone to operate,'
Mr Fumagalli said.
The new futures contract - known as the FIB 30 - will be promoted with a
series of international road-shows, beginning in London at the end of this
month, and will be traded between 9.30am and 5.30pm once the market is
launched.
The MIB 30 index, based on the 30 largest and most widely traded stocks, is
to be compiled by the exchange from today.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Indonesia's forest fires fan fury in Malaysia: An ecological
disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE and MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In mid-summer, Malaysia and Singapore noticed something strange happening to
the weather. On most days a thick haze, caused mainly by forest fires in
neighbouring Indonesia, blanketed much of the Malay Peninsula. The
authorities warned of the dangers to health. There were also air traffic
control problems.
Indonesia has now admitted the extent of the damage, describing the fires as
one of the worst ecological disasters in the country's history. 'Based on
the latest reports, the current fires have covered up to 5.1m hectares,'
said Mr Djamaluddin Suryohadikusumo, Indonesian forestry minister. In recent
days, rains have doused many of the fires, but underground peat deposits
continue to burn over an area larger than the Netherlands.
Within Indonesia, arguments over the cause of the fires continue, while
Malaysia and Singapore worry about the effects of the haze. There have been
worries about health; there are concerns that recent events could do serious
damage to the multi-billion-dollar tourist industries of both countries, and
in Malaysia there have been warnings of a dip in agricultural production.
The fires are believed to have initially broken out in early August, during
a prolonged drought. At first, the Jakarta authorities did not seem
over-concerned: the smoke did not affect the main Indonesian island of Java
but blew north-west towards Singapore and Malaysia.
Mr Djamaluddin is adamant that about 90 per cent of the fires were started
by local communities who practise a slash-and-burn form of farming to clear
land for agricultural uses.
But environmental groups in Indonesia blame the fires on plantation
companies who took advantage of a prolonged dry season to burn land and
plant palm oil. They also point the finger at logging companies who, they
say, are recklessly degrading forests and leaving large amounts of
combustible debris behind.
Critics say the Indonesian government not only lacks the necessary equipment
to try to control such fires; they contend it has shown little willingness
to intervene and settle land disputes between settlers and logging
companies, thought to be one of the other causes of the fires.
A fire on Kalimantan in 1982 destroyed a similar area of rain forest. 'This
present fire ranks as the worst,' said Ms Emmy Hafild of the Indonesian
forum for the environment, a leading non-governmental organisation. 'This
will happen every time we have a long drought, because most of our forests
have been degraded.'
Environmentalists are concerned about the increasing frequency of large
forest fires in Indonesia. Apart from the big fire in 1982, serious blazes
also occurred in 1987 and 1991. Neither Malaysia or Singapore have publicly
criticised Indonesia over the fires. Malaysia has its own pollution
problems, the result of eight years of more than 8 per cent economic growth,
and is reluctant to lay all the blame on Indonesia. But there is also a
wider issue.
Indonesia is seen much as the 'big brother' of the Association of South-East
Asian nations (Asean). Asean prides itself on solving its problems through
consensus. This can mean potentially tough issues are often ignored. So far,
the only outside help accepted by Jakarta has been an offer from Singapore
to give more weather information.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Suharto to be challenged in court on decree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MANUELA SARAGOSA
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Indonesia's political and economic stability belie the status and authority
of the judiciary. It is a generally held view that President Suharto and
senior cabinet ministers stand above the law and challenging authority at
this level is largely taboo.
The next few weeks, however, will see two cases which challenge the
government's authority at its highest level. Hearings on the first case
start today and involve Indonesian environmentalists suing President Suharto
for issuing a decree which allegedly allowed state money from a
reforestation project fund to be diverted to non-environmental causes. While
the president has said he will face the challenge, officials have also made
clear that he will not testify.
In the second case, a prominent journalist, Mr Gunawan Mohamad, and former
employees of the banned weekly magazine Tempo have filed a suit against Mr
Harmoko, minister of information, challenging him for banning the magazine
in June this year. Court hearings are expected to start within the next two
weeks.
Environmentalists and journalists admit their chances of winning are slim
but they remain undeterred. 'Winning or losing is not the target here,' said
Ms Emmy Hafild, project co-ordinator at Walhi, the Indonesian Forum for the
Environment, which is among the seven pressure groups bringing the case
against President Suharto. 'This suit is just a gesture.'
Earlier this month, a Jakarta court established at preliminary hearings that
the pressure groups and journalists have valid cases. Among other things,
environmentalists are accusing President Suharto of 'violating the
principles of good governance'. They have criticised him for not seeking
parliamentary approval before allegedly diverting the money from the
reforestation fund.
No fewer than seven environmental and legal pressure groups have joined
forces to file the suit against the 73-year-old president. They are
contesting a presidential decree, issued on June 2, which, they say, allowed
about Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) from a reforestation fund to be used for
developing a national aircraft industry.

'Implementing Reforms in the Telecommunications Sector: Lessons from
Experience.' Edited by Bjorn Wellenius and Peter A Stern; The World Bank,
757 pages; price Dollars 59.95
Bjorn Wellenius is telecommunications adviser to the World Bank and a
respected authority on telecoms development and restructuring. He and Peter
Stern have done a great service to governments and the telecoms industry by
bringing together this collection of studies on the international experience
of reform in the telecoms sector.
The lessons are of critical importance to developing and developed countries
alike. Virtually everyone agrees that telecoms modernisation is a spur to
economic growth, and will become steadily more important as the information
revolution advances.
Governments start from starkly differing positions, within as much as
between regions. At this summer's conference of the Asia-Pacific
Telecommunity in Bangkok, a speaker hailing the advance of the superhighway
in Australia was followed by another from Papau New Guinea recounting the
treks faced by villagers wanting to reach a rural pay phone. There is no
pretence in this book - which includes case studies of countries at all
stages from development, from Sri Lanka to France - that reform can proceed
without allowance for distinctive national and regional traits.
Nor is there any simplistic assertion that 'big-bang' change is the only
viable strategy. The US telecoms industry has retained its leading edge
within the confines of a law drafted in 1934 - which looks set to survive
for some while yet following the collapse of this year's Congressional
legislation - while the Canadian telecoms industry operates within a law
adopted in 1906 which is only now being redrafted.
In the developing world, 'build, operate, transfer' contracts have evolved
to inject private and foreign capital without breaching formal monopoly
regimes.
Even China's ministry of posts and telecommunications looks set to devise an
elaborate ruse to the same effect, following contracts signed in principle
this month with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK group which owns a majority stake
in Hongkong Telecom.
Yet the basic argument of the book, repeatedly propounded by the editors and
contributors, is simple and universal in its application: that the only
effective way to counter persistent shortfalls in telecoms investment is for
governments to attract greater private sector participation. And that can
only be done by abolishing monopolies, withdrawing the state from the direct
provision of services, and opening up telecoms services and infrastructure
to new entrants.
Wellenius and Stern note in the preface: 'Traditional state monopolies are
giving way to more complex sector structures that seek to overcome past
constraints on telecoms development through commercialisation of operations,
competition and private sector participation.'
Six hundred pages later, Richard Schultz wraps up the study with a subtle
attack on the 'exaggerated fears of restructuring,' highlighting the
'enhanced and refurbished' role left for the state after privatisation and
regulatory reform. For policy-makers, the most useful of the 39 intervening
chapters are the introduction and the regional overviews, which set reform
programmes within the broad parameters of public sector constraints and the
demands of private investors.
The introduction by Wellenius and Stern is about politics as much as
telecoms. Discussing the slow pace of reform in sub-Saharan Africa, they
note that the region could have 'most to gain' from reform but that little
has happened in part because 'national security is still a politically
significant issue, compounded by a broader concern about foreign control of
key factors of economic production and distribution'. The rapid development
of telecoms in Latin America is explicitly linked to the return to democracy
across the region in the late 1980s.
The thesis that economic liberalisation requires prior political
liberalisation is hardly novel, nor is it necessarily disproved by China's
experience.
In the case of telecoms, however, it is a challenge to those, notably in the
US, who see telecoms development and the 'global information infrastructure'
as a means to promote democracy and all that goes with it. The reverse is
probably the reality. I shall never forget a phone interview earlier this
year with a western businessman in Rwanda's capital of Kigali, across a
brilliantly clear fibre-optic international line, as he described the
slaughter and mayhem taking place in the streets outside.
Latin America is the developing-world model which inspires the authors.
Chile led the way with privatisation in 1987; in Argentina, Mexico and
Venezuela subsequent privatisations were completed in less than two years
(only in Mexico was much done to improve the network before privatisation);
and most other countries in the region have followed suit.
In his over-view, Wellenius pronounces most of the reforms broadly
successful, although he notes serious regulatory issues which remain
unresolved. His rule of thumb is that privatisation and liberalisation can
be carried through in two or three years, but it takes a decade to sort out
the regulation.
A key factor in the Mexican reform process was the opening of the cellular
market to competition at an early stage of the reform process. This is also
the case across Asia-Pacific and Europe, where competition in cellular
networks is now widespread and is being extended to fixed-line networks.
There are three clear benefits to such an incremental strategy: it obliges
governments to tackle inter-connection and regulation of the state operator
before its main business is subject to competition; it forces the pace of
reform in the fixed-wire sector, where political and trade union obstacles
to change are greater; and it brings together consortia, often led by
non-telecoms groups such as Mannesmann in Germany and Bouygues in France,
which can move across to the larger fixed-wire sector as liberalisation
advances.
The mobile communications sector, becoming ever more important, is strangely
neglected. The absence of an index is frustrating. But the book is
nonetheless a bible for those contemplating structural telecoms reform.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (24): Surprising
collaborations emerge - Value-added Services / Phone companies and software
suppliers aim to reap the benefits of the electronic mail bonanza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To ask a telephone company to do joint marketing with a software company is
a bit like asking the tortoise if it would collaborate with the hare. It
seems like a complete mis-match in commercial culture. Yet that could be
just what the phone companies have to do in order to boost their value-added
services business.
The reason is electronic mail. Email is one of the fastest growing software
applications for personal computers. Software giants Microsoft, Lotus and
Novell/WordPerfect have targeted communications as the next big growth area
for their own applications. They have simplified end-user email software and
are aggressively pursuing it.
One of the problems with email services in the past is that they were not
user-friendly, and were usually accessed by equally unfriendly
communications software.
Lotus, Microsoft and Novell/WordPerfect have evolved software which makes it
easy for people to send mail, directly from their spreadsheets and word
processors: what they call 'mail enabled applications.' It uses the same
interface that people are used to in their other applications, so that
people do not need to learn a new way of working just to send mail.
Jenny Proctor, UK marketing director of AT&amp;T Ezylink, cited the example of
economists in the City of London who want to replace fax with email for
sending reports to customers. This is the direct result of the improved
personal computer software - 'in the finance sector, mail enabled
applications are a growth area,' she says.
This should be good news for the telephone companies, which have the
opportunity to sell services to support the increased demand for
connectivity - 'software companies such as Microsoft have simplified
end-user software, and are promoting telecom activities. This is now acting
as a driver for messaging services and frame relay managed data network
services,' comments Neil Lawrence, applications and information marketing
manager at British Telecom.
The corporate email systems typically run on local area networks (lans);
lans in different buildings are connected to create an 'enterprise-wide
system.'
One way to achieve lan-to-lan connections is to use a frame relay managed
data network service - frame relay being a faster method of transmission
than older packet switched data networks and more suitable for connecting
lans. This segment of the market is currently small, with an estimated value
of Ecu60m (Dollars 74.4m) across Europe, according to London-based market
research consultancy Ovum; this is due to the fact that frame relay is a new
technology.
However, sales are growing fast, and vendors such as BT and AT&amp;T report that
they are struggling to keep up with demand for frame relay services: BT
claims this segment of the market is growing at 300-400 per cent, per year.
Ovum analyst Clare McCarthy predicts a sharp upturn in growth from 1996
onwards - 'by 1998, we are looking at projected European revenues of around
Ecu800m (Dollars 992m) for frame relay services,' she adds.
Another way to connect lans is to use the public email services offered by
the telephone companies. Most email services provide a simple way to connect
the popular proprietary lans such as Lotus cc: Mail and Microsoft Mail. For
example, cc: Mail users could connect to a service and send mail between two
sites without ever knowing they were not using cc: Mail all the way.
According to Ovum, this market will grow at an average of 53 per cent a year
in Europe.
However, in order to reap the benefits of the email bonanza, the telephone
companies have to become as aggressive in their marketing tactics as the
software companies themselves. It represents a significant cultural shift
away from traditional telephone company thinking.
According to Mr Lawrence, there has been a sea change in the way user
purchasing decisions are taken. In the past, users would go through the IT
department to get email. Now they buy it out of their own budget -
'end-users are now becoming more influential in purchase decisions,' he
says.
To attract end-users, the phone companies will have to work with Microsoft,
Lotus and Novell/WordPerfect on product marketing as well as product
development. For example, BT has a collaborative arrangement with Microsoft
which permits geographically dispersed workers to use Microsoft groupware
software for collaborative working over ISDN lines.
This will be an odd situation for most phone companies. According to some
industry observers, those who have faced competition in core services, such
as the US or UK phone companies, should be flexible enough to cope. Others
will have difficulty, especially those which still operate in a
non-competitive monopoly environment.
End-users are also being attracted by the Internet, and Compuserve, two
global network services which actively target individuals, and sell the
benefits of going on-line. They are pursuing high profile marketing
campaigns and are creating an awakening as to the possibilities of email.
This could represent a further threat to the traditional email networks as
operated by the telephone companies. The
take up of traditional email does not match the quoted numbers for the
Internet, which has 30m users worldwide. The Internet - or 'The Net,' as it
is commonly called - covers around 140 countries and is expanding at the
rate of ten per cent a month. Well over two million computers are linked to
the network.
In the UK alone, there are a million Internet users and numbers are growing,
according to David Mooring, marketing consultant with Pipex, a reseller of
Internet connections.
Pipex and others are targeting corporate customers, and they could provide
more of a competitive threat to the traditional electronic mail services
market. Mr Mooring points out that today most of those users are academics,
but adds: 'The number of commercial users is growing. I reckon that in a
year's time there will be more non-academic users than academics.'
However, Neil Lawrence believes that business customers are attracted by the
concept of the Internet, but find they need the greater security features of
the business messaging networks. 'Once people consider investing, they ask
'Is it secure?' and 'Do I get an audit trail?'' he says.
Mr Lawrence reports an increased number of enquiries for British Telecom's
messaging services in recent months, in response to the Internet marketing
campaigns.
Jenny Proctor believes the email market will split into two groups: serious
business applications and personal 'chat'/lightweight business use.
She sees an emerging group of business customers who will require a more
sophisticated electronic mail service, which the telephone companies are in
the best position to provide.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (25): Tactical
advantage for racers - New mobile communications application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the European cycle racing season draws to a close, riders on the Motorola
squad will be hanging up their Lycra and switching off their radios. For
three years the American-based team has been using lightweight portable
radios to give it a tactical advantage and to improve race safety.
In the big races like the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, the Spanish Vuelte
and the Tour DuPont in the US, the teams of up to nine riders each have to
keep in touch with their managers who follow in cars. They need to know when
team tactics are changing and when a colleague needs help.
Traditionally, the manager has driven alongside the riders and barked
instructions. The Peloton Communication System that Motorola uses means this
dangerous manoeuvre is no longer necessary.
Each of the riders carries a receiver in their jersey pocket and an earpiece
fitted into his crash helmet. It can pick up the manager's signal at up to
four miles away, a distance that can easily separate first and last riders
on an Alpine race.
To keep the manager informed of what is happening in the centre of the
bunch, one rider in the team has a transmitter unit, weighing eight ounces,
fitted under his saddle and a microphone mounted on the handlebar. He tells
the manager whether any team-mate needs attention and how rival teams are
performing.
The Motorola team reckons the system gives it a competitive advantage. The
team spokesman and former Tour de France cyclist Paul Sherwen is convinced
it helps them to win - 'in the Paris-Nice five-day race last year, our rider
Frankie Andreou got out front in a breakaway group,' he says. 'It became
clear that he was wondering whether he should drop back to conserve his
energy. Then our team leader realised that the chasing group was tiring and
the message went to Frankie to keep up the pressure. As a result, the break-
away survived much longer than it would otherwise have done.'
He also believes the team's radio saves time - 'if you are in the middle of
the main bunch of up to 200 riders and you have a puncture, you put your
hand up and hope that a race official sees it quickly. The official then
gets a message to your team manager who drives forward with a spare wheel.
It can take more than a minute to get help,' says Sherwen.
Similar equipment has long been in use in automobile racing. Motorola has
worked with the Benetton Formula 1 team and with Indy Cars in the US, but
every ounce counts when cyclists have to pedal for six hours up 12,000 ft
mountain roads. 'Motorola managed to cut the weight of the receiver unit to
just 2.5 ounces by modifying a standard Minitor pager,' says Paul Sherwen,
'It is just light enough for the riders to accept the burden.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (23): More power
now for the users - Equipment Supply Industry / Increased competition and
the aftermath of recession have tilted the balance of power away from the
telecoms operators towards the users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTYN WARWICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International telecommunications was the industry which stood up best to the
the global recession of the early 1990s. While many other industries
suffered, telecoms kept going at a strong pace, often on the basis that
while one country, trading bloc or applications sector declined, another
one, somewhere, was bound to be on the way up.
Thus, while the market in Europe, the US and Japan stagnated, telecoms
operators, manufacturers and equipment suppliers focused their attentions on
the more buoyant markets of parts of South East Asia, the Middle East and
Gulf and South America.
They also pitched for a share of the massive, but traditionally difficult,
Chinese market and made forays into the highly uncertain world of
post-communist Russia and eastern Europe.
However, while it is true that the telecoms sector survived the recession
more or less intact, the prevailing conditions of that period have had a
long-term effect. The present shape of the industry is, in part, the direct
result of the realities of adapting to, and coping with a massive,
worldwide, economic downturn.
The other big contributory element is the remarkable increase in
international competition in the provision of telecoms equipment and
services. It is interesting to note that research undertaken by the public
telecommunications organisations (PTOs) in Europe indicates that 80 per cent
of their business is in the domestic sector.
Of the 20 per cent that is non-domestic traffic, 80 per cent is
trans-European rather than intercontinental. Of that European traffic, 90
per cent terminates within 1000 kilometres of its place of origin.
So, at first sight then, it might seems odd that European PTOs and other
carriers are rushing into global alliances in the way that they are. The
reason is competition: the battle to supply and service the world's biggest
international companies is under way in earnest. Meanwhile, the combined
effects of recession and intense competition lie behind the plethora of
mergers, partnerships and alliances which characterise today's telecoms
environment.
When the recession arrived, manufacturers soon discovered that even wealthy
countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, cut back on infrastructure
projects and expected even greater value for money. Tendering processes
changed, competition intensified and margins were cut as prospective
customers demanded - and won - more comprehensive and generally cheaper
technological solutions, supplied to tighter specifications and stringent
timetables.
It soon became apparent to the big industry players, as well as the second
line organisations, that the pace of technological change combined with a
new market dynamic, meant that no one company, no matter how big, could any
longer claim to be able to develop and supply every component of a telecoms
solution. The result has been a rash of affiliations and acquisitions as
manufacturer has combined with manufacturer, supplier with supplier and
operator with operator in an unprecedented series of industry alliances.
Some, such as the proposed Synoptics and Wellfleet merger, the Chipcom and
Cisco partnership, the Cisco and Hewlett-Packard relationship and BT's
coalition with the Nordic telecom operators, are carefully planned exercises
which can be seen to have both immediate and long term benefits for all
partners concerned.
However, there is a downside. Most mergers are described as alliances and
partnerships, rather than take-overs, but in many cases retention of the
name of the smaller company is an indication of the potency of its
particular brand rather than its continued independence.
Some other corporate exercises, although presented as grand designs and
strategic alliances, are, in reality, little more than panicky reactions to
changed market conditions. It is more than likely that some of these will
end in dismal failure. A new report from telecoms strategy consultants,
Analysys, supports this conclusion, observing that established names in both
the telecoms and computing-services markets could effectively disappear as
wave after wave of alliance activity washes over the converging sectors of
telecoms and information technology.
Alliances are taking place because manufacturers and carriers alike have to
fill the gaping holes in their portfolios of offerings if they are to stand
any chance in the battle for the mighty budgets of their target customers:
the world's largest corporations and multinational businesses.
Companies with, or intending to build, global corporate networks have woken
up to the fact that telecoms systems can leverage competitive advantage. The
telcos have responded with a variety of initiatives, the most radical of
which is the concept of 'total outsourcing,' whereby companies hand over
complete responsibility for the design, deployment and management of their
telecom systems to a carrier and its affiliated suppliers, partners and
acolytes.
So far, the strategy has not met with great success, since many users, while
apparently keen to contemplate a move from private to public networks, are
unwilling to abdicate responsibility for a vital corporate lifeline until a
number of important issues have been addressed.
A key concern is that carriers are carriers, and therefore cannot appreciate
the subtleties and nuances of non-telecoms business sectors. Other issues of
concern include the poor service and weak customer-care characteristic of
some of the European and North American carriers, as well as restrictive
contracts, uncertainty over cost comparisons and limited geographical
coverage.
The telecoms research organisation, CIT, estimates that the total telecom
spend by the world's top 1,000 companies will top Pounds 25bn by 2003. It is
obvious then, that aspirant providers of global networks and end-to-end
service packages must answer user concerns - or fail in a market of massive
strategic importance.
Carriers are also striving to develop and market the ultimate carrier
service: as power and bandwidth continue to become cheaper, business is
looking for a true multimedia information exchange system which will
interconnect LANs and WANs and provide voice, image, video, data,
information processing and even entertainment services across the corporate
network.
The provider alliance that can provide such a system at the right price  -
and that does not necessarily mean the first one to market - will have the
world at its feet and emerge as the telecoms carrier equivalent of Atilla
the Hun.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (21): Australian
battle begins - The gradual introduction of intensified competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Frank Blount, the former AT&amp;T executive who runs Telstra, the large
government-owned telecommunications group, is forthright about where the
Australian market is headed - 'competition will intensify: this is just the
warm-up,' he says.
Few industry observers would disagree. As recently as the late-1980s, the
Australian telecoms market was essentially government-controlled and
dominated by three entities. There was the Australian Telecommunications
Commission, which ran the domestic telecom services; the Overseas
Telecommunications Commission (OTC), which provided international services;
and Aussat, which was responsible for Australia's satellite communications
system.
Already, there have been significant changes. The first two entities were
merged to form Telstra (which goes by the Telecom name in its home market)
and is still wholly-owned by the federal government. Aussat, meanwhile, was
sold to Optus, a new second telecom carrier licenced in early 1992. Having
started by competing with Telecom in cellular telephone market, Optus moved
into long-distance services in late-1992.
To improve Optus' chances, a series of ballots were held in Australia's
larger cities, giving customers a well-publicised opportunity to choose
between the new carrier and Telecom for their international and national
long distance services. This process is still continuing, although it has
begun to move on to 'second-line' cities such as Bendigo/Ballarat in
Victoria where balloting starts on October 12.
Responses have varied, but in the key Sydney market almost 20 per cent of
subscribers opted to move away from Telecom. In Melbourne, the figure was 14
per cent. At the same time, selective opportunities have been available for
overseas players. The UK's Vodaphone won entry into the mobile phone market
last year, for example, initially offering services in Melbourne, Sydney and
Canberra.
A number of international companies have also entered the 're-sale' market.
Last month, Pacific Star, a joint venture company established by Telecom NZ
and Bell Atlantic, signed a deal with Optus under which the latter will
supply long-distance services to Pacific.
But, as Mr Blount says, this limited opening-up of the telecoms sector is
almost certainly just the start. The duopoly system in the long-distance
market was always intended to be an interim arrangement, and the federal
government's declared aim is to move towards full network competition by the
middle of 1997.
Earlier this year, in a speech to the annual conference of the Australian
Telecommunications Users' Group, Mr Michael Lee, federal minister with
responsibility for the industry, indicated post-1997 regime would have
Canberra playing only a 'minimal' role, 'protecting consumers and
facilitating competition.'
The government appears to envisage the introduction of new legislation,
setting out the ground-rules for this liberalised environment, in the
back-half of 1995. That would then give companies seeking to enter the
Australian market an 18-month window in which to develop their plans.
Among the many issues which the post-1997 planning will need to address is
what long-term role, if any, should be played by Austel, the industry
watchdog. As Australia moves to greater competition on numerous fronts, Mr
Lee has noted: 'It is quite clear that . . . the role of specialist industry
regulators like Austel will have to be examined.'
For Telecom, liberalisation of the Australian telecommunications market has
posed big management questions. The business has not always been held in
high regard by its customers, nor has it fared particularly well in terms of
international benchmarking studies - especially in some key areas, like
labour productivity.
Telecom's image was dealt a blow when Austel published its report on the
'Casualties of Telecom' affair earlier this year. The CoT group was a
self-styled band of protesters, mainly made up of small businesses, who
claimed that the company had failed to take their service complaints
seriously and, in some instances, caused them significant financial loss as
a result.
Although Austel handed its judgment down in moderate language and the
CoT-related complaints were a minute proportion of the total business
handled by Telecom, the impression left by the report was highly
unfavourable. Telecom, the regulator decided, had failed to take some
complaints seriously and its behaviour was 'less than that of a model
corporate citizen.'
But if the challenge of imbuing Telecomwith service values whilst cutting
staff numbers without damaging morale, look formidable, the financial
picture is more satisfactory. Last month, Telstra unveiled an after-tax
profit of ADollars 1.7bn after tax and exceptional items - up from ADollars
905m in the previous year - on revenues 5.6 per cent higher, at ADollars
13.4bn. Since half of Telstra's after-tax profits are now paid to its
shareholder by way of a dividend, meaning an inflow of ADollars 738m into
government coffers.
But even on this score there are problems. Some observers question what sort
of return is appropriate for a government-owned utility. Others ask whether
Telstra should really be in the private sector.
Mr Blount, unveiling the results, declined to be drawn on the thorny,
highly-politicised privatisation issue, beyond noting that ministers have
said that the business will not be handed over to the private sector in the
term of this government.
He did, however, note that 'the development of a world class Australian
telecommunications network requires massive investment.' Over the next three
years, Telstra plans to spend over ADollars 3.5bn. One of the biggest single
investments will be in digital equipment to modernise the network.
The company has also pledged to take its fibre optic and coaxial cable
network into 1.1m Australian home by the end of 1996 at an investment cost
of ADollars 710m - suggesting that cable pay-TV may then become a serious
rival to the currently more advanced satellite availability.
For Optus, the issue is how to capitalise on Telecom's weaknesses. The
newcomer is owned by a mix of domestic and international institutions and
acquired a new shareholder in Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network, the leading
commercial TV network, in March. Nine Network paid ADollars 318m for a 15
per cent stake. Optus has said that it expects to float at least part of its
equity on the stockmarket during the next calender years, and brokers have
already been appointed.
As a private company, Optus does not release full earnings reports. However,
it makes no secret of the fact that it ran at a loss in 1993/4, although Mr
Bob Mansfield, chief executive, has said it should break even in the current
12 months and move into profit thereafter. Revenues in the year just ended
have been estimated at well in excess of ADollars 800m, and possibly over
the ADollars 1bn-mark in annualised terms.

<TEXT>
The outlines of the new structure of the world telecoms industry are starkly
clear: three rival alliances of operators, each seeking to create and corner
the market for one-stop international telecoms contracts. Although defensive
as much as offensive in motivation, the alliances are displaying less and
less regard for the 'cartel culture' which has hitherto governed
international telecoms.
The three alliances are headed respectively by British Telecommunications,
AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, and Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned German
carrier.
Concert, the joint venture company headed by BT, is widely credited as the
most advanced of the three alliances. Its cornerstone is a Dollars 5.3bn
alliance between BT and MCI, the second-largest US long-distance carrier,
forged in June 1993. The alliance involved BT taking a 20 per cent stake in
MCI for Dollars 4.3bn, and the establishment by the two companies of a
Dollars 1bn joint venture (Concert), based in the US, to develop and market
one-stop voice and data services for multinationals.
Concert has gained regulatory approval on both sides of the Atlantic and
launched a range of voice and data services. Its main strategic priority is
building relationships with national operators to market its wares.
So far, it has signed up three of the four Nordic national operators
(Norwegian Telecom, Telecom Finland and Tele Danmark, the Danish national
operator), and Nippon Information and Communication (NIC), a small joint
venture between NTT, the Japanese national domestic, and IBM Japan.
None of these tie-ups involves equity exchanges or is exclusive, although
the Nordic alliance is more than a simple marketing agreement since the four
partners have agreed jointly to attack the Swedish corporate market where
the national operator, Telia, is a key member of a rival alliance. However,
BT does not rule out more equity partners for Concert. Its most evident
weakness is in the crucial Asia-Pacific region, where NIC is no substitute
for its parent (NTT), or for one of the larger national operators.
Worldsource/Unisource, the second of the alliances, is a more complex hybrid
formed this June between two different groupings: AT&amp;T's Worldsource venture
and Unisource, a joint venture between four mainland European operators.
The two have been growing separately - indeed, in competition - for more
than a year, but are now committed to progressing in partnership.
Worldsource involves no equity exchanges between carriers, but is a bid by
AT&amp;T to enlist a cast of leading national and regional operators to market
and help provide its international business services.
The members, who have joined with differing degrees of commitment, include
KDD, the Japanese international operator, Singapore Telecom, and Telstra,
the Australian national operator. Telstra is a significant force across
Asia-Pacific.
Until this June, Worldsource's obvious weakness lay in Europe. AT&amp;T pondered
several strategic options but for a year appeared reluctant to chose between
them. In the end, Unisource became an almost inevitable partner.
A joint venture between the national operators of Sweden, Switzerland and
the Netherlands, Unisource has direct contact with most of Europe's
multinationals and was developing a solid reputation. Its imminent expansion
 -now completed - to include Telefonica, the semi-state owned Spanish
national carrier, was a further attraction to AT&amp;T because of Telefonica's
significant operations in Latin America. And since Unisource included none
of Europe's four largest carriers, the tie-up is hard for regulators to
oppose on competition grounds.
For its part, Unisource needed a US partner urgently to be credible to
multinationals. Early in the year it joined AT&amp;T in a successful bid to
provide telecoms facilities to the EVUA, an association of more than 30
European multinationals contracting for a common corporate network for their
European traffic.
'It brings us what we needed to make a strong competitor in this
international market,' says Mr Viesturs Vucins, Unisource chief executive.
Atlas, the third alliance, comprises Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and
Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance carrier.
As with the AT&amp;T/Unisource alliance, Atlas was preceded by a grouping of the
European carriers, who a year ago formed a joint venture called 'Eunetcom.'
In June, this was expanded to include Sprint, when France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom signed a deal to take a 20 per cent stake in the US
operator for Dollars 4.2bn.
'There are hard and soft alliances in this industry,' says a leading
corporate finance adviser to Deutsche Telekom. 'To our mind, the lesson of
BT/MCI's marriage was that only the hard variety were durable, so we had to
go the whole way.'
However, Atlas may yet founder on the rock of regulation. BT faced a
marathon examination by US regulatory authorities, lasting over a year, when
it was pressed hard on the issue of the openness of the UK telecoms market
to competition.
The US has since formally declared the UK's telecoms regime to be
'equivalent' to the US in terms of the openness - the only country besides
Canada to enjoy that status.
By that token, Atlas is set for a traumatic ordeal before the Federal
Communications Commission and the US Department of Justice. Neither the
French nor the German public voice telephony markets are open to competition
 -and will not be until 1998.
AT&amp;T is making much of the prospect of 'monopoly' revenues being used to
'subsidise' Sprint in its US and international activities, while US
operators are unable to compete head-on in either France or Germany. Atlas
has to answer similar charges before the European Commission.
Even if Atlas is allowed to proceed, it lacks Asia-Pacific partners. Mr
Helmut Ricke, chairman of Deutsche Telekom, says Asia is 'an immediate
concern', but partnerships have yet to be announced.
If the outline of the alliances is increasingly clear, vital issues
concerning their future remain shrouded in mist. Three issues in particular,
each of which has ramifications for international telecommunications more
broadly:
Market share: the alliances proclaim multinational companies - anywhere
between 400 and 4,000 of them, depending on the interviewee - as their
target.
How fast will they gain them? And is that just the first, large step on a
road which could see the alliances corner a large part of international
telecoms business?
There is alarm among the smaller European PTTs, which fear that isolation
from the alliances could result in a haemorrhage of lucrative corporate
traffic, since their main corporate customers are almost by definition
'multinational.'
Liberalisation makes the threat more potent still: the likes of BT and AT&amp;T
are already allowed to operate private corporate networks across the
European Union; if - as appears likely - full infrastructure liberalisation
takes place across the EU in 1998, they will be able to put their weight
behind fully-fledged alternative carriers if they consider that to be the
best way into the local market.
However, for most Asia-Pacific carriers the pressure to ally is less
intense. Although the region includes liberal telecoms regimes such as
Australia, most of the market for international telecoms appears set to
remain protected by monopolies into the next century.
Cartel pricing: executives of the alliances say that they need to offer
savings on basic prices of at least 10 per cent to make their one-stop
services attractive. However, it is too soon to claim that the new regime
will undermine the cartel which keeps international prices artificially
high.
If, in a given market, the effect of the PTT joining an alliance is to keep
out effective competition, it could have the opposite effect.
Margins: is the core business of the alliances - one-stop international
corporate services - high or low margin business?
The pessimists say low margin, because multinationals are demanding large
savings for one-stop contracts. However, the optimists stress the undoubted
dynamic effect of improved networks in boosting traffic and the sale of new
services.
Furthermore, should corporate networks be the thin end of a larger wedge,
the pickings could be richer still. That, at any rate, is the view from
AT&amp;T, BT and Deutsche Telekom.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): Mexico
making up for lost time - An attractive market for investors / Telecom
prices in Mexico are falling sharply as a result of competition and the
emergence of cellular services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While governments in other countries remain cautious about deregulation,
Mexico is forging ahead with a swingeing reform programme that will bring
the national operator Telmex into direct competition with some of the most
powerful telephone companies north of the border.
Competition will largely be in long-distance services. The Ministry of
Communications and Transport agreed in July to grant an unlimited number of
licences to companies to offer long- distance services from January 1997. A
detailed regulatory framework for the new operators will be drawn up in the
autumn.
Several Mexican industrial and financial groups have already thrown their
hats into the ring. The leading contenders are those companies which have
forged links with US telephone operators.
Three such groups have emerged:
Mexico's largest financial group, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival
(Banacci), which has taken a 55 per cent stake in a consortium with US
long-distance operator MCI.
Mexican cellular telephone operator Iusacell, which is 49 per cent owned by
Bell Atlantic. Iusacell also has a liceence to build a fixed wireless local
telephone network.
US telecoms equipment manufacturer Motorola and the Mexican industrial
conglomerate Grupo Protexa; also, the US long-distance operator Sprint is in
discussions with Grupo Protexa about joining the consortium.
Joshua Levenburg, a Latin American analyst at Pyramid Research in
Massachussets, says there is 'enormous interest' in the Mexican market -
'the opening of the long-distance market is a tremendous investment
opportunity,' he adds.
Pyramid Research estimates that telecoms service revenues in Mexico will
almost double from Dollars 7.6bn in 1993 to Dollars 14.4bn in 1998; the
market grew by 16 per cent in 1993.
Mexican long-distance calling patterns are favourable for new operators.
Seventy-five per cent of all long-distance traffic is between the cities of
Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City.
Telmex's long-distance and international call revenues last year totalled
Dollars 4.2bn - more than 50 per cent of Telmex's total revenues.
Mexico's low telephone line-penetration levels also make it an attractive
market for investors. There are only eight telephone lines for every hundred
people. Telmex is having problems meeting the demand for new lines, and this
gives operators of wireless systems - who can instal lines in a matter of
days - a distinct advantage.
Telmex is vulnerable to competition - 'you've got some major players with
deep pockets coming in,' observes Eduardo Cabrera. It is difficult to
forecast the effect of competition on Telmex, he adds - 'the key question in
Mexico at the moment is how profitable Telmex will be in the long term.'
A proposed licence fee for new competitors in the range Dollars 100m to
Dollars 500m will dampen the prospects for competition. But a more important
issue is the interconnection fees that competitors will have to pay Telmex
for passing calls over its network.
Telmex will be seeking to pass on to competitors - through their
interconnection charges - part of the cost of operating its loss-making
local telephone network.
Long-distance competitors will operate along similar lines to companies such
as MCI and Sprint in the US.
Telmex customers will able to dial a code to choose a long-distance carrier,
but they will also have the option of subscribing to a particular carrier
for all their long-distance calls. This is the same system as in the US
where AT&amp;T has lost 35 per cent of the long-distance and international calls
market.
But competition will develop along different lines than in the US where
local networks remain closed to competition. Two of the three leading
Mexican consortia operate cellular telephone networks. Iusacell owns
cellular telephone networks in Mexico City, and controls other concession in
Guadalajara and in the centre and south-east of Mexico. Its concessions
cover almost three-quarters of the Mexican population. Motorola, meanwhile,
has stakes in cellular telephone networks across the whole of the 2,000-mile
border with the US.
This gives the two consortia a big advantage over other prospective
long-distance operators. Even when a customer choses a competing
long-distance operator, the call begins and ends on local phone lines
connecting the orginator and the person who receives the call. The competing
carrier has to pay Telmex for these two local ends, and these payments could
eat into profits derived from the long-distance section of the call.
Motorola and Iusacell can get round this problem by connecting customers to
their long-distance networks using their cellular networks.
Cellular phone services are currently too expensive for customers to
consider using them as an alternative to Telmex's standard telephone
service. But prices are falling sharply as a result of competition and the
emergence of cellular as a residential as well as a business service.
In the meantime, Iusacell is building one of the world's first local fixed
telephone networks using cellular telephone technology. The network, which
will open in a rural area close to Mexico City in the late autumn, uses
frequencies at around 450MHz - the same part of the radio spectrum used by
Scandinavian phone companies for first generation cellular telephone
networks, launched in the early 1980s. Iusacells's network is supplied by
Northern Telecom which has a Dollars 330m three-year contract.
Telmex has been bracing itself for competition since its privatisation in
1990 - 'they've done a commendable job of trying to improve the technology:
70 per cent of the network is now digital,' notes Cabrera.
Telmex has also hiked up local call rates and reduced long-distance and
international charges where it will face stiffest competition.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (19): Fierce
competition in Swedish market - Prices tumble for international and
long-distance calls / Pressures in Sweden's liberalised telecoms sector are
intensifying as large international players enter the fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden vies with New Zealand for the title of the world's most liberalised
telecoms market, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). Having for many years had a de facto state-owned
monopoly operating in an unregulated environment, it has moved rapidly to
establish a light regulatory framework designed to promote open and fair
competition.
The results have been striking. Despite the relatively small size of the
country - Sweden's population is just 8.7m - some of the world's biggest
telecommunications groups, including AT&amp;T , British Telecom and France
Telecom, have entered the market. Moreover a number of new competitors have
sprung up, led by Tele2, jointly owned by Swedish media group Kinnevik and
Cable &amp; Wireless.
It means that Telia, the dominant operator, is being challenged as never
before - 'Telia faces fierce competition on customer premises equipment,
data communications services, cellular services, international calls,
national long distance calls and infrastructure,' says Stig-Arne Larsson,
Telia's deputy chief executive.
Indeed, local calls and Sweden's analog NMT mobile network are two of the
few domains where Telia still has a 100 per cent market share.
The competition has brought a fall in international and long-distance prices
in a country where they already low by international standards. But there
has not been a full-blown price war and the effect on Telia's profits has so
far been limited.
What is clear is that pressures in the domestic market are intensifying. In
just 18 months, Tele 2 has bagged more than 10 per cent of the international
calls market, and from this autumn it will offer domestic long-distance
services.
Moreover, Telia has lost international calls and data transmission business
to overseas rivals. It was more than a little dismayed when StatTel, a state
procurement body, passed over it to award a prestigious data transmission
contract to France Telecom.
The biggest challenge may yet be to come. BT has just announced a
partnership agreement with Telia's Scandinavian rivals - Norwegian Telecom,
Telecom Finland and Tele Danmark - as part of a specific drive to win
business in the Swedish market. Telia purports not to be alarmed by the
increasing pressures, saying it expects to lose up to 40 per cent of
international calls and 25 per cent of long-distance traffic in the next two
years. Losing more than this would test Telia's patience, however, which may
force it to be much more aggressive on pricing than it has been so far.
'Being the market leader, we cannot stage a head-on price war. We would
destroy the market and ruin our company,' comments Mr Larsson, while
acknowledging it would be politically insensitive if the group went out to
destroy the competition before it has fully developed. Telia has responded
to the onslaught in a number of ways:
Firstly, it has implemented a fierce cost-cutting programme, reducing staff
numbers from 48,000 to 32,000 in three years.
Secondly, it has begun differentiating its products more, offering customers
tailor-made packages to meet their needs.
Finally, it has gone on the offensive both at home - where it is actively
building its position in mobile telephones, for example - and in markets
outside Sweden. There are two strands to the overseas expansion strategy.
One is to retaliate directly against competitors in their own home markets.
A good example is the UK where Telia has been awarded a licence for
international calls and has set up a switch in London.
The trouble here is that access to most other European markets is
restricted.
The second plank of attack is Unisource, a venture with Swiss, Dutch and
Spanish partners which is specifically designed to provide the international
clout which the four companies lack individually. The grouping has forged a
joint venture with AT&amp;T for the delivery of voice services to 50
multinationals.
Telia says it can share costs through Unisource while defending its home
market (because multinationals can be offered one-stop shopping and a
broader global reach) and capturing market share in other European
countries. Again, the last ambition will have to await a broader
deregulation of the European market.
Some worry that Telia is still too dominant, claiming the newly-established
regulatory body, the National Post &amp; Telecom Agency, is not trying actively
enough to promote competition. Underlying this is a broader concern about
conflicts of interest when there is state-owned agency regulating a fully
state-owned company.
Jerker Torngren, the NPTA's Head of International Affairs, does not see it
this way. He says: 'What we want to create is competition. We are not saying
we need a certain division of market share to create that competition.'
He also rebuts the conflict of interest suggestion, saying that in Sweden
there is a very strict dividing line between the government ministries which
draft legislation and the agencies which implement it - 'it is the
government which owns Telia, not us,' he stresses, adding that there are no
policy implications in the fact that Telia is state-owned.
Another concern is that the agency lacks the teeth to enforce its decisions.
For example, in the current row between Telia and Tele2 concerning
long-distance interconnection rights, the agency can act as a mediator, but
it cannot force the warring parties to abide by its findings.
This is a weakness which could always be ironed out in due course. There
were always likely to be some teething troubles given the dramatic change
being implemented and the fact that much of the legislation governing the
sector only took effect on July 1, 1993. In any case, there is a competition
authority to fall back on, as its powers are more than adequate to deal with
any clear abuse by Telia of its dominant position.
The one surprise is that Telia, though behaving in virtually every respect
like a private company, is still state-owned. This may change in due course.
There is no doubt that management is keen on privatisation: the incoming
Social Democratic government is much more ambigious about the process. Even
so, the Social Democrats have hinted they may not oppose privatisation if
they think it will help the group's international expansion ambitions.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): Moving into
the limelight - European Wireless Messaging / A far cry from tone bleepers,
European wireless messaging offers a multiplicity of new business and
personal communications applications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL QUIGLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine the nightmare office scenario: you are alone and it's late - but you
need to send documents, several pages in length, to colleagues who may be
next door, in another town or even in another country. They need your
missive, instantaneously, wherever they may be. You cannot send them
facsimile messages - you do not know exactly where they are; they might have
a cellular telephone, but you cannot phone them because the details they
require are complex, specific or not readily communicable by word of mouth.
What you have, and what they need, is mission-critical information.
What would you do? Panic? Delegate? Resign? Situations like this, you
realise, were not covered at business school.
The pager? Indeed so: having endured the ignominy of time, living in the
shadow of cellular telephony, the trusty war-horse of mobile
telecommunications has kept up with the times and has been transformed into
a high-speed, high-capacity, frequency-agile 'wireless messaging' device. A
far cry from tone bleepers, European wireless messaging is moving into the
international limelight as a serious contender for a global wireless
messaging standard, offering a multiplicity of innovative business and
personal communications applications.
The European Radio Message System (Ermes), an EC-championed second
generation digital radio-paging standard, is a model for international
co-operation in telecommunications. Conceived in 1987, Ermes uses 16 radio
channels between 169.4-169.8 MHz, and can hop about each available frequency
band to transmit vital information at speeds up to 6,250 kilobits per second
to pocket mobile messaging devices.
As a broadcast-based service, Ermes' inherent strength lies in its ability
to move large amounts of information from point-to-point, point to
multi-point, and also multi-point to multi-point. Thus, any number of
value-added service providers can offer tailored information broadcast
products to end-users over any Ermes networks.
As cross-border mobile and fixed telecoms traffic increases year on year,
business systems and applications that cut through national boundaries, and
can 'roam,' are now fundamental pre-requisites. While 31 European radio
paging network operators are currently signatories to the Ermes 'Memorandum
of Understanding' (MoU), interest is growing outside its European origins.
Paging operators across the Asia-Pacific region are set to sign up to the
standard.
'Interest from the Asia-Pacific region is very important' says Mr Per
Berntsen, chairman of the Ermes MoU group, 'because we are talking about
very large volumes.'
Ermes operators also see the future in satellite distribution. Not only of
value-added services that will be available to national and international
subscribers, but also in enabling Ermes networks to be rolled-out across
countries utilising satellite up-links and down-links between message
switching centres and their base stations. This, effectively, reduces
operator infrastructure costs by eliminating a large proportion of the
networks' requirement for private leased-line circuits - hard-wired or
microwave links - whilst at the same time, increasing the potential volume
of base stations to serve the coverage areas. Additionally, with minimal or
no paging bureaux personnel message-handling interlocution, network
operators will be able to pass on cost-savings from lower overheads to
cheaper messaging and terminal unit costs.
The key factor with new mobile communications technologies now coming
on-stream is that they will be targeted at new user segments, not solely
those who are already well-catered for; Ermes, and generic wireless
messaging, will have a much broader user appeal as operators and value-added
service providers launch global products.
Mr Berntsen concurs with this view - 'there will be those who don't have
GSM, or cellular telephones, who would rather have a pager because of the
type of work they do or on the grounds of the cost-effectiveness. Remember
that mobile telephone services have always had a traffic cost - paging does
not. No connection charge, no monthly rental - the calling part pays. It's a
question of segmentation of markets.'
Successful new messaging applications will be those that are modest, but not
radical variants on current practices. For example, the PC running Windows
applications software will be a familiar front-end for many business and
personal computer users. The prospect of accessing a pan-European, indeed
global network, through a communications software package will be about as
daunting as loading and printing a document file.
Further feature-rich benefits of international wireless messaging will
include the ability to connect a cable from the pager to desktop or notebook
PCs, and let the PC store incoming wireless messages direct to the hard
disk.
This could ensure critical messages are not wiped inadvertently from the
device's volatile random access memory. You could, therefore, leave your
pager behind and not miss messages, news or share prices.
Even the pan-European digital cellular systems, GSM (Global System for
Mobile Communications and its sister technology, DCS1800, would have trouble
performing the tasks required in the nightmare scenario, outlined above. GSM
and DCS1800 both offer a short-message service (SMS), but have a limit of
166 characters (about 20 words) per message. Compare this with Ermes' 9,000
characters per message and you start to see the limitations and
possibilities. Wireless electronic-mail could also be a possibility, but
this option too requires colleagues to be available, carrying their portable
PCs fitted with radio modems, being within range of either a cellular
network or a dedicated packet mobile data network - and powered up.
Message retrieval services would not be appropriate in the nightmare
scenario; certainly, they would want the information - but when? The next
day?
'Text messaging and personal wireless information services will be very
important in the future,' Mr Berntsen believes. 'They will become a natural
part of most people's working environment. I think they will need a pager -
even if they have a mobile telephone. Ermes has the potential for giving
such services to most markets, he adds. 'We will see more creative ways of
making information services that will also have a great appeal to the
public.'
Ermes also has capabilities to acknowledge receipt of transmitted
information, though this is not seen by the Mr Berntsen as a particular
enhancement that will be in demand at this stage, while it is not being
ruled out for the future. With digital cellular promising voice, data and
fax services, mobile data promising wireless email and remote dial-up data
services and download functionality, wireless messaging can offer
alphanumeric document transfer and real-time broadcast information services
at minimal costs.
Clearly, the convergence process of historically disparate mobile
communications technologies is well under way.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (17): A change of
image in the US - Growing interest in two-way radio paging services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD HARFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio paging, perhaps the least glamourous area of the telecoms industry, is
set for its own star turn in the US, thanks to a series of auctions of radio
spectrum, staged by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the
summer.
The commission succeeded in raising over Dollars 600m from companies eager
to bid against one another to acquire a new allocation of radio frequencies
that will enable the winners to offer - for the first time, anywhere -
two-way paging services.
The auction exceeded expectations and attracted bidders from outside the
confines of the paging industry: two of the most successful were KDM
Messaging, a wholly-owned subsidiary of McCaw Cellular, America's largest
cellular operator which has been taken over by AT&amp;T, the largest telecoms
company in the world; and - among others - Destineer, a new company which
has the backing of the software giant, Microsoft. Both companies appreciated
how two-way services go beyond the limitations of the staid, limited-revenue
potential of existing paging systems. New systems allow users to make and
receive data messages and paging - sold as one of the new range of
interactive multimedia services.
Destineer and AirTouch, one of the largest cellular operators in the US and
a one-way paging operator which also bid successfully for some of the new
frequencies, are looking at similar applications: both want to use two-way
paging as way to invigorate the market for personal digital assistants
(PDAs), the personal organiser-messaging devices launched last year by
various manufacturers, including Apple Computers and AT&amp;T. Initial sales of
the Apple Newton Messagepad were disappointing; and AT&amp;T's EO has been
withdrawn from sale.
However, AirTouch in particular believes that PDAs can succeed if pitched at
a business rather than consumer audience. The company is already using its
existing paging network for trials to a PDA manufactured by the electronics
company Casio and will extend the service to its new two-way frequencies
next year.
AirTouch is also looking at new, industrial applications for paging such as
a monitoring device which would be sold to suppliers of vending machines. A
radio device, fitted inside a vending system, would emit a signal when it
was time for restocking, thus saving the time and expense of regular checks
by the vending machine supplier. All five of the US companies licensed by
the FCC are looking at similar new ways of widening paging's appeal and
increasing its already substantial penetration in the US - where,
incidentally, eight per cent of the population owns a pager.
By comparison, in Europe, only three per cent of the population are
pager-users; there is also greater market pressure in Europe as the cost of
using cellular phones continues to fall.
Cellular, particularly since the arrival of digital phones based on the
pan-European GSM standard, would swamp the European paging industry unless
it can maintain its price differential or explore more advanced
applications.
Two initiatives in paging during the past year demonstrate the way that
European industry is getting to grips with the challenge:
First, there was the launch of the MiniCall service last year by Sweden's
state-owned mobile operator, Telia Mobiltel. This has had a significant
influence on the marketing strategies of other European operators. MiniCall
is known as a 'CPP' service which stands for 'calling party pays.' In other
words, the tariff burden is shifted from the pager-user - who buys the pager
but no longer pays a one-off connection fee or monthly rental charges - to
the caller who wants to leave a message. Instead of a standard local call
tariff, the caller is charged at a premium-rate for leaving a message. The
lost revenue from connection and subscription charges is more than made up
by increased contribution from call charges, according to Telia Mobiltel.
The Swedish model was closely studied by other-operators including BT and
Mercury who launched their own versions of the service this autumn. BT gave
their service an extra twist by offering it with the UK's first wristwatch
pager, manufactured by Swatch.
Secondly, an important innovation in Europe this year has been the launch of
digital paging services. Based on an European Commission-backed standard
called Ermes (European radio messaging system), the system had several
technical setbacks following interference to television sets in Germany,
before its launch in France. Several other European operators are to start
Ermes services in the near future; Telia Mobitel will launch its Minicall
Europe service in the first quarter of 1995.
Initially, Ermes terminals will be significantly more expensive than today's
pagers but they will offer a wider range of services. The system transmits
messages faster and is capable of including more text in each message.
Futhermore, users are able to receive messages electronically from computers
on Ermes pagers.
Ermes' main advantage over existing paging systems is that, as a common
European standard, it is possible for the first time to receive messages
across Europe.
As the equivalent digital technology to cellular's GSM, which now has nearly
3m subscribers in Europe, Ermes must make a similar impression if paging is
to shake off its dowdy image.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (14): You can
always switch off - Satellites will provide mobile phone links - everywhere
/ A portable phone that works anywhere worldwide is no longer science
fiction, according to satellite operators. Serious investment lies behind
their dreams of global telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Less than ten years ago, when cellular radio opened in London, hand-held
mobile phones were a novelty. They cost a king's ransom and had most of the
characteristics of a brick (including the nickname), but they represented a
genuine breakthrough.
For the first time anyone with the money could make phone calls from more or
less anywhere - at least, anywhere in range of a base station anyway. Now
another communications breakthrough is about to move those base stations
into the sky so that portable phone users will always be in touch, no matter
where they are throughout the world.
Purists will no doubt argue that luggable mobile telephones existed before
cellular and that you can already make phone calls by satellite worldwide if
you are prepared to carry around a terminal the size of a briefcase.
Neither of these solutions were mass-market products, whereas the new
generation of portable phones are intended for a wide user-base, even if the
cost restricts take-up in the early stages.
Charges, in fact, should not be a big hindrance among potential users:
according to Iridium, front-runner among the satellite phone consortia,
dual-mode handsets will allow users to switch to cheaper land-based services
when possible.
lridium customers can expect to pay Dollars 3 (Pounds 1.80) a minute for
calls, whilst their rivals intend to undercut this figure. Vodafone, a
member of Globalstar, another consortium, says typical charges will
represent only a modest premium to existing cellular tariffs. Indeed, in the
US, Globalstar has announced prices as low as 65 cents - just under Pounds 1
 -a minute.
Six competing consortia have announced plans to offer global telephone
services by means of satellites in low earth orbit ('Leo' satellites) and a
seventh is expected shortly. lridium, led by Motorola, was the pioneer
scheme and has been joined by contenders Globalstar, TRW, Teledesic,
Constellation Communications and Ellipsat.
Rather than compete with established cellular radio operators, the sky-based
systems will collaborate with them, offering them franchises. The UK's
Vodafone group has, for instance, acquired the franchises for Globalstar in
the territories where it is already involved in operating cellular networks.
These include Australia, South Africa, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, Sweden,
Malta, Greece and, of course, the UK.
Gerry Whent, Vodafone chief executive, explains the rationale for this:
'We've always been at the leading edge of mobile telecoms technology and we
regard the Globalstar service as being complementary to the terrestrial
cellular networks that we already operate in a number of countries.
'It will enhance the potential coverage to subscribers in more remote areas
who will use dual-mode handsets capable of using either terrestrial GSM
networks or Globalstar when out of local cellular coverage areas.'
In terms of technology and service offering there are general similarities
between the plans announced so far. Globalstar and lridium will both open
commercially in 1998 and each will also allow their subscribers to use
land-based GSM cellular systems wherever available (and incidentally,
confirming GSM as the de facto global standard for mobile phones).
Iridium services will include voice, data, facsimile and paging. lridium
will employ a 'constellation' of 66 Leo satellites, whilst Globalstar is
based on a constellation of 48 - whereas lridium plans links to pass
international calls between satellites, Globalstar does not, and will rely
on long-distance terrestrial networks.
The scale of investment required - lridium will cost Dollars 3.2bn to build
 -means that costs must be shared between constructors and network
operators. The consortium announced this month that Germany's Vebacom would
take a 10 per cent stake and invest at least Dollars 140m to acquire in
return the northern and western European gateway territories.
In Globalstar, Vodafone has joined nine other international companies and
will contribute Dollars 37.5m in 1994-95 for a stake of around 10 per cent
in the consortium.
Not all potential global satellite operators are newcomers, however. BT and
other partners in Inmarsat, the international consortium providing satcomms
to shipping and airlines, have announced their own hand-held satellite phone
called Inmarsat-P and targeted for introduction by 1998-2000.
Whether all these plans will come to fruition is anyone's guess: some
observers are chary whether the total business to be had can support such
grandiose plans - and they fear charges may need to be raised to protect
terrestrial networks, especially in developing countries. Some nations may
demand a high premium for the tight to establish earth stations, forcing up
charges further.
Some European telecom operators are also privately critical of what they see
as US aims of global domination in satellite communications, as well as 'bad
faith.' Because satellites ignore national boundaries, any service
authorised in the US has, in effect, a world-wide operating licence, and as
long as customers are happy to deal with an operator in America, they can
use their phones wherever they choose. This, they say, gives the US an
unfair advantage.
There is also disagreement over frequency allocations: channels or
frequencies for radio communication are at a premium; a world conference in
1992 set aside radio spectrum in all countries for a new, third-generation
terrestrial mobile phone system.
However, in the US, part of this spectrum has now been allocated to lridium
and other Leo satellite systems, pre-empting its use for other services.
Whilst this may be expedient now, it could also cause problems for the
future development of the terrestrial service. Official talk of a rift is
discounted, however, by David Court, head of the European Radio
Communications Office in Copenhagen: 'We would merely point to a difference
in emphasis between the US and Europe; America is clearly focusing on
satellite services, whereas Europe is more concerned with terrestrial
services,' he says.
The vision of the phone that works everywhere is now within reach, which
must assure the future of personal satellite communication systems. Coupled
with a personal follow-me phone number, the user will stay in touch with the
world wherever he or she roams. Thankfully an on/off switch is also a
standard fitting.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (15): Many
bridges to be crossed - Multimedia / Multimedia has been the victim of its
own promotion, but that's no reason to write it off entirely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The cynical tags, 'vapourware' and 'real soon now' are commonly associated
more with computing than telecommunications, but multimedia could change
this. Vendors who traditionally shunned the hyping of products seem to have
lost their inhibitions with multimedia, even though its most dynamic aspect
appears to be the extravagance of the claims made.
For many observers, despair and disinterest have replaced early enthusiasm,
as the multimedia concept is successively redefined and relaunched.
On the other hand, according to the 'real soon now' merchants, the promises
and predictions for multimedia are, after an agonising wait, starting to
turn into products.
Indeed, multimedia communication is believed by industry pundits to be the
growth market of the 1990s and is set to repeat for manufacturers the
commercial bonanza of the fax revolution of the eighties.
Multimedia is defined as the integration of a variety of audio-visual
presentation methods into a single framework, using a personal computer as
the 'platform' or basis. The technique is well established as a presentation
medium and is now being advocated as the universal answer to business
communications, as well. The problem is that multimedia may be adopted for
the wrong reasons.
'The corporate world always has a tendency to grasp at the newest advance in
technology as a panacea for all their problems,' comments Judy Roland,
director of Mouse Power Presentations, a multimedia creative studio based in
Box, Wiltshire.
'Like any other communications tool, multimedia is appropriate for achieving
some business objectives - but not all,' she asserts. 'We have a major
education problem, not to get management to accept multimedia - they do so,
already - but to show them it's not always the most appropriate technique
nor is it some miracle means where you just press a button and it
revolutionises your work.
'Multimedia has a serious role to play - it's already used much more
maturely in the US - but it shouldn't be chosen purely for faddish reasons.'
Identifying the kind of productivity improvements that multimedia is
expected to achieve is even harder, according to Jeff Goldberg, an analyst
with technology research consultancy, Dataquest.
'The truth is that multimedia is a completely abused topic, one which has
been described incorrectly by industry and misunderstood by users,' he
explains.
'Multimedia is not a technique or goal in isolation but rather one single
element of a much broader discipline. Anyone who promotes multimedia for its
own sake is heading for trouble.'
To date, he says, the most successful applications for multimedia have been
in presentation and these have been adopted and accepted, not because they
were touted as multimedia but rather because no-one even mentioned the 'M'
word.
Whereas the average business presentation a year ago used simple black and
white transparencies and an overhead projector, today you see computer
graphics in colour and motion on a video projector. This, he asserts, is an
appropriate and practical application for multimedia, even if other people
do not class it as such.
According to Goldberg, multimedia's chief achievement - so far - is in its
use as a 'fix' to correct the inadequacies of the basic PC computer. To fill
in the gaps in the original PC specification, suppliers have come up with
improved sound and vision capabilities, together with the ability to play
CD-ROM disks, turning the humble PC into a powerful tool for training,
video-conferencing, distance-learning and, inevitably, computer games.
Nevertheless, he concedes that this early incarnation that we currently call
multimedia is insignificant in terms of market share and cannot be said to
fulfil the ambitious claims made for the concept.
Other parties are pinning their faith in the home TV set as the agent of the
multimedia revolution. This autumn, hundreds of homes in Cambridge will take
part in interactive multimedia trials and will be offered personalised news
services, video-on-demand, games, education and armchair shopping. Large
companies are involved, including Cambridge Cable, News International,
Anglia Television, Acorn Computers and Olivetti.
To some observers, however, the trial sounds suspiciously like a repeat of
BT's encounters of the expensive kind with Prestel, dial-up computer games
and movies by cable a decade ago, which proved minimal user demand. Probably
the most valuable information that the trial will generate is that the home
TV is not the most appropriate platform for multimedia.
So perhaps multimedia belongs in the office after all; certainly that's
where the larger informatics companies see its future. Companies such as
Alcatel, Philips, IBM and Olivetti, as well as telecoms players such as BT
envisage multimedia as a unified total communication system: unlike the
telephones, fax machines, computers and even videophones we have today,
multimedia combines all these capabilities and more in one single desktop
terminal.
Now, they say, the common desktop computer has been transformed into
something much more powerful, in fact a real tool for business. Soon we
could be seeing the person we are phoning in a corner of our PC screen, with
this image then replaced by sight of a document we are discussing jointly.
Researchers could examine pictures in a photographic library at any time,
without leaving their desk, then extract the images required and use them in
a new presentation of their own.
Significant problems remain before this can come to pass. Setting aside the
lack of apparent user applications and easy-to-use connectivity, there are
big bridges to cross in terms of workplace culture and user training.
According to a senior executive of one of the companies just mentioned,
multimedia offers the office automation industry a Iicence to print money -
users are keen to adopt leading-edge technology and are probably prepared to
pay for it - 'but,' he confesses in the same breath, 'the tragedy is that
we'll probably blow the opportunity . . . simply because all this technology
is too complicated to use.
'If people cannot even program their video recorders at home, how on earth
will they relate to a Pentium PC, a CD-ROM player and two video cameras to
drive?'
His dilemma may be not be so imminent, though: according to Dataquest's
Goldberg, the multimedia revolution can only take place with an adequate
communications infrastructure and this has not been fully defined or
developed yet.
Existing technologies are too expensive and take-off will depend on further
progress with data compression or the deployment of an affordable universal
broadband network.
Until then, it will remain an effective technique for specialist
applications, but hardly the all-embracing cure-all portrayed up to now.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (13): Farewell to
underwater phones - New equipment application / Sonar modems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX GLASKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sonar modems that transmit text and graphics underwater are speeding up the
work of divers. Since July, US defence agencies have been testing 'wet'
portable computers that use sonar to maintain continuous contact with the
surface.
The hand-held computers mean that divers can dispense with a lot of their
conventional clutter such as plastic writing slates, depth gauges and ropes.
The built-in sonar modem allows the surface crew to monitor the progress of
the dive, to receive data from the diver and to relay messages that increase
the diver's safety.
'Underwater telephones can distort your speech and be hard to understand,'
says Marco Flagg, whose Desert Star Systems, California, designed the
DiveTracker computer. 'They can also need extra cables. Our system overcomes
these problems and it can also store all the data from a dive, including
logging the diver's movements.'
The DiveTracker is a box a little larger than a mobile phone, machined out
of portable aluminium to withstand the pressure 1,000 feet down. It includes
the standard depth and tank pressure gauges which are integrated with the
computer. It has a micro controller with 538 kilobytes of memory holding the
operating system and bespoke applications software. There is a back-lit
graphic LCD display of 64 by 128 pixels and a solid-state 16-key pad
operated with a magnetic pointer.
It is powered by an internal rechargeable nickel-cadmium battery that is
said to last up to eight hours if the modem is used only 'moderately.' If
used continuously, the battery runs flat in two hours. Once back on board
ship, there is an RS-232C serial port for downloading data to an
IBM-compatible personal computer.
Software for DiveTracker is written in the 'C' programming language and the
first package covers the three main needs of a diver - dive
status/decompression display, communication and navigation.
Each function has its own display screen. Besides a graphic dive profile it
also shows the present depth, tank pressure, water temperature, time
elapsed, air consumption and remaining air time. The modem has a range of
300 feet in 'noisy' waters, where the sounds from creatures such as dolphins
disrupt the signal, up to 3,000 feet in tranquil lakes.
DiveTracker models cost between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 3,000. It is being
used across a range of military applications. These include the enigmatic
category of 'special warfare' and the less mysterious disposal of
explosives, as well as positioning divers on underwater structures for ship
repairs.
The system should slot into the military's chain of command easily - 'the
precise navigation capability - accurate to within six inches - along with
the system's communication capabilities allow more efficient mission control
to military users,' says Marco Flagg. In other words, even captains in their
cabins will be able to know exactly what their divers are doing, 1,000 ft
below.
There is a software package that is targeted for divers that need to follow
precise search patterns under water, such as in explosive ordnance disposal.
In the scientific field, there has been an interest to use DiveTracker for
data recording as well as a sensor data acquisition device.
One group may also use it to track scientists performing their underwater
experiments: safety regulations call for surface team members to be aware of
scientist-diver locations.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): Landmark
rulings - Canada / New national policies in Canada will bring vigorous
competition between the telephone companies and cable-TV operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada has moved more cautiously than many other industrial countries to
lift the regulatory barriers which have long stifled competition in the
telecommunications market. The slow pace of change has given consumers fewer
choices and has arguably held back technological innovation.
On the other hand, Canadians continue to enjoy one of the world's most
efficient phone systems, and among the lowest charges for basic service.
However, the winds of change are likely to blow more strongly in the wake of
a series of landmark rulings in mid-September by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).
The CRTC's new policy, which is expected to form the regulatory framework
for the next 10 to 20 years, opens the way for much more vigorous
competition between the established provincial phone companies, cable-TV
operators and the plethora of resellers which have recently gained a
toe-hold in the long-distance market. (Resellers offer discount prices by
leasing lines at bulk rates from the phone companies).
'The Commission has determined that barriers to entry, as well as
restrictions on the participation of telephone companies in emerging
information and transactional telecommunications service markets, should be
removed,' concludes the CRTC in its 165-page report.
Under the ruling, the hefty cross-subsidy between long-distance and local
calls will be significantly reduced by allowing local phone companies to
push up their charges by as much as 40 per cent over the next three years.
At the same time, the CRTC will relax price regulation replacing a
rate-of-return yardstick with a more market-oriented system of price caps -
'this should lead to price stability for consumers and and greater
flexibility for telephone companies to invest in a more modern
infrastructure and to introduce new services,' says the CRTC.
These reforms are likely to encourage newcomers to enter the local market in
competition with the provincial phone companies, such as Bell Canada
(Ontario and Quebec), BC Telecom (British Columbia) and AGT (Alberta), which
presently have a monopoly on local services. But the telcos will also be
free to spread their wings, both as carriers and content providers.
Although they will not for the time being be granted broadcast licences,
they will be able to provide distribution facilities for broadcasters,
including cable companies.
Analysts at Nesbitt Burns, a Toronto securities firm, predict that the
ruling will benefit almost every sector of the telecommunications industry.
The big phone companies 'asked for a more freely competitive market where
they would have the flexibility to use their experience, expertise and
considerable reach to offer a broad range of services to customers,' Nesbitt
Burns says in a report. 'This decision goes a very long way in that
direction.'
Resellers are likely to reap the benefit of lower charges for access to the
telcos' switching facilities - 'in the medium-term, the advent of local
competition could lead to some profitable expansion opportunities,' adds
Nesbitt Burns.
Cable-TV operators will also be able to broaden their horizons, without any
siginficant erosion of their existing businesses. Within each sector
however, there are bound to be winners and losers.
Judging by recent experience in the long-distance market, where competition
began in 1992, some surprises are also in store. The telephone companies,
which have long had a reputation as slow-moving behemoths, have turned out
to be unexpectedly agile. Bell Canada has cut its long-distance charges by
an average of 30 pc since 1987, and by up to 60 pc for high-volume users.
Productivity improvements, including the elimination of 5,000 jobs, have
shaved 11 per cent off Bell's operating costs per access line over the past
five years.
By contrast, business has been unexpectedly tough for the plethora of
newcomers in the long-distance market. Unitel, which pioneered competitive
long-distance services, lost CDollars 82m in 1992 and another CDollars 525m
last year.
Most resellers do not expect to be in the black until 1996 at the earliest.
STN, one of the most aggressive resellers, recently announced a thorough
restructuring, including the departure of its chief executive, after seeing
its share price tumble from a peak of CDollars 7.63 in the second half of
last year, to little more than CDollars 2 in mid-September.
Even before the recent CRTC decision, the phone companies had begun to
secure their position in the converging worlds of telephony, broadcasting,
computers and consumer electronics.
Stentor, which is the long-distance consortium of provincial telcos,
unveiled plans earlier this year for an open-access, interactive broadband
network.
The coast-to-coast project - known as the Beacon iniative - involves an
investment of about CDollars 8bn, and aims to reach 80-90 per cent of
Canadian homes and businesses within the next decade. Stentor is also in the
process of setting up a multimedia company to develop suitable content for
the system.
The cable-TV industry is smaller and more fragmented than the phone
business. But cable companies have the advantage that more than four in
every five Canadian homes have access to cable, one of the highest
penetrations in the world. Their ability to offer competitive local phone
service is growing with the gradual installation of fibre-optic networks
equipped with two-way switches.
By far the best-placed cable company is Rogers Communications of Toronto.
Rogers, whose interests include a stake in Unitel, the long-distance
operator, struck a deal earlier this year to buy Maclean Hunter, the third
biggest cable operator.
Once the purchase is finalised, Rogers will have a 31 per cent share of
Canada's cable market. The Rogers-Maclean Hunter deal could be the start of
a period of consolidation, which would put the cable industry in a better
position either to forge alliances with the phone companies, or to challenge
them head on.

Three years after the start of the economic liberalisation programme by
India's prime minister, Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the nation's telephone networks
are being opened to private investment.
Albeit with many important issues left unsettled, government officials are
ending the state's monopoly of basic telephone services and inviting bids
from private companies, including foreign groups, to help transform one of
the world's least developed networks.
The conditions under which private investment will be permitted were
published only last month, so few would-be bidders have had time to study
the fine print. Moreover, the precise relationship between the private
operator and the state network has yet to be decided, including crucial
matters such as pricing and revenue-sharing.
Nevertheless, the prospect of winning even a small share of the undeveloped
Indian market, with its population of 890m people, has drawn expressions of
interest from all over the world. The telecommunications ministry says that
100 groups have filed outline proposals.
With only eight lines per thousand people, India has one of the least
developed telephone networks in the world. China has 17; and Malaysia, 130.
Only 140,000 of India's 576,000 villages have telephones. The country needs
telephones not only to fulfil its aim of increasing international trade and
investment but also to provide a basic communications network for its
people.
Until this year, the government's aim was to increase from the number of
lines from 5.8m in early 1992 by 7.5m to 13.3m by the end of the current
five-year plan in March 1997. But this would have left some 2.5m people
still on the waiting list. So, the target was raised in May to 10m new
lines.
With its own funds squeezed by the need to control public spending, the
government is relying on private companies to raise much of the extra
Rs230bn it needs on top of Rs330bn it had previously ear-marked from public
funds for 1992-97.
Big though it is, the total may not be unreachable. Even before the
government announced its new telecommunications policy, permitting private
investment, in May, private groups, including foreign companies, had
submitted to the government 21 plans together worth Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.5bn) for telephone networks. Among the foreign companies are industry
leaders such as US West, AT&amp;T, and Motorola of the US, Siemens of Germany,
and Japan's Fujitsu.
But it will be difficult to meet the government's demanding time-table,
given the department's past record in accommodating the private sector. With
46 trade unions, representing 470,000 workers, the department has long been
suspicious of changes which curb its influence. Since 1992, when value-added
services such as cellular telephones and voice mail were liberalised, the
department has been entrusted with handling potential competitors from the
private sector. The result has been confusion and delay. Cellular telephones
contract awards made in October 1992 were challenged in court by
unsuccessful bidders in a case which went to the Supreme Court, which then
ordered the ministry to reconsider the bids. A new award was expected in
early October.
The acrimonious debate inside the department which has accompanied the
launch of the new policy for basic services does not bode well for its
smooth implementation. Mr Nagarajan Vittal, the former telecoms secretary,
who was transferred out of the ministry a month ago, lost his job because he
became involved in a public row with his minister, Mr Sukh Ram.
Mr Vittal, brought into the ministry last year to spearhead pro-market
reforms, fought hard to make the new policy as liberal as possible. Mr Sukh
Ram, supported by the department's trade unions, adopted a more cautious
approach. Mr Narasimha Rao felt he had no choice but to move Mr Vittal for
abusing his position as a civil servant in speaking too publicly.
Mr Vittal's departure was followed by the announcement of details off the
new policy, which include a 49 per cent cap on foreign investment in any
private carrier. Private companies will also be limited to providing local
networks - they will be barred from operating the much more lucrative
long-distance and international services.
Companies will be free to bid for licences in 18 regions, which roughly
correspond with India's states. Only one private carrier will be permitted
to operate in each region - but will face competition from the existing
state-owned service.
Licence-holders will be required to offer lines in rural districts as well
as the far more lucrative towns and cities. The licences will run for 15
years and there will be no restriction on the number of licences awarded to
any one company. Mr Sukh Ram has said he hopes the first private carrier
would start operating in 1995.
There will also be a new regulatory body - the Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India, which will oversee the private operators. It will not have a
separate statutory existence from the telecommunications department.
The guidelines have provoked a mixed response from industry. There is relief
that Mr Vittal's departure has not further delayed the progress of the new
policy. But there is also concern that the arrangements for pricing and
revenue-sharing have not been announced. The published policy leaves the
telecommunications department with ill-defined powers to control the
negotiations with bidders, creating great scope for delays and for
corruption.
However, some executives argue that the lack of clarity is the price
companies will have to pay for investing in the market at the beginning of
its development. They believe that the ultimate prizes will justify the cost
and risk of entering the industry early.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (9): Further
turbulence ahead - Japan / The deadline is approaching for Tokyo to make a
long-term decision on the future of telecommunications in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The past few years have been a tumultuous time for the more than 210,000
employees of NTT, Japan's huge telecommunications company.
Just under a decade since it was privatised, NTT has had to embark on a
wide-ranging restructuring effort, fight a fierce battle against newcomers
in the profitable long-distance market and venture for the first time in its
history outside the domestic telecommunications business into the 'unknown
world' of multimedia.
But if the past few years of frenetic activity at NTT have unsettled its
employees, more accustomed to the bureaucratic ways of the former monopoly,
the years ahead promise to be even more turbulent.
Next year, the Japanese government is expected to make a long-overdue
decision on the future of NTT, which is still over 65 per cent owned by the
finance ministry. They are scheduled to conduct a telecoms review which will
have implications far beyond NTT's own operations and is likely to change
the shape of Japan's telecommunications industry in the years to come.
As in many other industrialised countries, the Japanese government faces a
pressing need to review the regulatory environment surrounding its telecoms
sector and to draw up a vision of what the industry should look like in the
21st century.
Although Japan was relatively early in deregulating its telecoms industry
with the privatisation of NTT in 1985, the measures it adopted back then
were half-baked. Rather than break up the former telecoms monopoly into
separate regional or business entities, the Japanese authorities preserved
NTT as a dominant operator with national coverage and introduced competition
only into the domestic long-distance and cellular markets. NTT was kept in
control of the crucial local network.
While the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications made it known on
reviewing NTT's status in 1990 that it favours breaking up NTT, the decision
was deferred for five years.
The result of the authorities' decision to allow only partial deregulation
of the telecoms sector so far has been that almost ten years after NTT was
privatised, the Japanese market suffers from the adverse effects of a lack
of competition.
The price of telecom services in Japan, from simple phone calls to more
value-added services, is still relatively high, particularly for
long-distance calls, compared with what is charged in more liberalised
markets.
The tight regulatory environment and the lack of competition has stunted the
development of new services, which are expected to play an important role in
stimulating future economic development.
The experience in the cellular market has been somewhat different, with a
second phase of liberalisation in April this year stimulating greater
competition and rapid growth. However, even in the relatively open cellular
market penetration is low compared with many countries in the west due to
high user charges.
Tokyo's telecommunications authorities have indicated recently that they are
in favour of further deregulation of the market in preparation for the much
more expanded information industry extending from telecoms to computer
communications and broadcasting that is expected to emerge within the next
decade or so.
As the deadline approaches for the Japanese authorities to make a long-term
decision on NTT and the future of telecommunications in Japan, and as it has
become increasingly evident that the US is leading the way in building an
advanced information society, the MPT has appeared increasingly favourable
towards changes in the industry, not only to catch up with the US but to
ensure the country's future economic and social well-being.
Mr Shun Oide, Japan's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, emphasised
the importance that telecoms is expected to play in the country's future
development in addressing a gathering of international telecoms ministers in
Kyoto last month.
Japan faces various difficult issues, such as dealing with the unprecedented
ageing of its society, rectifying the excessive centralisation upon Tokyo,
converting the framework of industry and employment to create products and
services with high added value through effective use of knowledge and skill,
and realising life-styles for our citizens which bring both comfort and an
enhanced spiritual quality of life, Mr Oide says.
These issues 'can no longer be solved with the conventional methods of
industrialised society,' he notes. 'Instead, we believe that an approach
through information networks, allowing the best use of information and
expertise, is essential.'
Telecommunications, together with other forms of information transmission,
and the future multimedia services they will provide, are also expected to
become a key source of economic activity.
The MPT estimates that with an advanced telecommunications infrastructure in
place, the multimedia market will grow to a leading industry with a value of
Y123 trillion yen and creating 2.43m new jobs by 2010.
Such considerations will form the basis for the authorities' decision next
year on the fate of NTT and the future of Japan's telecoms industry.
It has become increasingly clear to the authorities that deregulation and
greater competition are crucial in preparing the Japanese telecoms industry
for future growth. In recent statements, the MPT has indicated that it is
looking to the CATV companies to provide further competition to telecom
operators.
'It is important to establish the fibre-optic network efficiently through
the competition of private companies. The telecommunications carriers and
CATV operators are expected to build networks competitively,' a recent MPT
report states.
However, the need to nurture a strong information industry in many ways
complicates matters.
If greater competition in the market were the only goal, there would be a
strong case for breaking up NTT, a step the telecommunications ministry has
long favoured.
While competition on some vital intra-city lines has been heated, with three
new common carriers taking over 50 per cent of traffic on the important
Tokyo-Osaka line, the three long-distance carriers' share of the
intra-prefectural market last year was just 29 per cent.
NTT has been able to keep a tight grip on the long-distance market through
its monopoly on local lines which, in effect, has allowed it to control
access charges and gain information on its competitors' costs.
'The minimum pre-requisite for the three new common carriers' entry into the
long-distance market was the breaking up of NTT into long-distance and local
businesses,' said Mr Kazuo Inamori, president of Kyocera and chairman of
DDI, in a recent interview. However, plans to build an advanced information
industry have brought other considerations into the picture.
While competition is important in stimulating new developments, the huge
investment required and wide-ranging business territory to be covered by
communications operators calls for large, integrated companies to support
the information industry.
As Mr Masashi Kojima, president of NTT, argues: 'Telecommunications
companies from now on will provide a full range of services from telephone
and fax to personal computer communications and cable television.
Competition in future will be between large companies and there will be very
little room for companies than can only compete in parts of the market.'
Rather than breaking up NTT - a move that would create smaller companies
which would be less competitive in the global multimedia race  - the
authorities should work towards integrating smaller companies into a larger
company that can offer a full range of services, Mr Kojima asserts.
NTT, which has already converted trunk lines to optic fibre, also believes
it is the only company that is capable of building Japan's super highway
infrastructure singlehandedly. Breaking the company up, as the MPT
envisions, would weaken its ability to do so, the company argues.
The growing view among industry watchers is that despite arguments against
divestiture, there is a strong chance the MPT will in the end follow its
initial instincts and break up NTT at least into separate long-distance and
local businesses. The impact of such a move, combined with deregulation of
the CATV industry announced this year, is expected to stimulate the
development of Japan's telecom and cable industries into the information
industry of the future.
Increased competition from cable operators provided an incentive for the US
Regional Bell Operating Companies to modernise their networks to provide
advanced communications capabilities, which in turn, helped them to improve
profit margins, notes Mr Dargan at SG Warburg.
Greater competition upon divestiture could also encourage the MPT to relax
rules which currently restrict NTT from offering cable TV and other
services, Mr Dargan points out.
When that happens, Japan will move one step closer to the US in building
companies that can offer the public a full range of multimedia services.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10):  The debate
intensifies - Information 'Superhighways' / Superhighways are flavour of the
month with politicians and techno-buffs alike. But while they attract public
attention with promises of science fiction-type services, they are also a
target for cynics who question their commercial viability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The debate is hotting up over new superhighways - telecommunications
networks that will carry multi-media services to homes and businesses. The
issues are whether or not these superhighways should be laid automatically
in every town, village and street, whether or not there is a return on the
investment - or whether they should only go where they are profitable.
The telephone companies want to be free to develop the superhighway
according to commercial demand. But politically, they are under pressure to
ensure that all members of the population, rich and poor, rural and urban,
have equal opportunity to access it. Information is a now a commodity, and
people would be disadvantaged by not having access to it.
In the UK, the Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said recently that he
feared a society of 'information haves and have nots.' The information
super-highway could be used to widen the gap between rich and poor, between
the affluent urban areas and remote village communities. And US vice
president Al Gore laid down in his original proposal for the National
Information Infrastructure (the official name for the US superhighway) that
the information superhighway must be accessible to all people everywhere.
The superhighways will be constructed from fibre optic cable because fibre
has the necessary capacity for transmitting multimedia services. Fibre can
carry data at speeds up to 2 gigabits per second. Old fashioned copper is
limited to 64 kilobits per second.
But a fibre optic network is expensive, especially if the fibre is to
replace all of the existing copper lines into individual premises - known as
the local loop. BT, for example, estimates Pounds 15bn to take fibre to the
majority of UK population, rising to Pounds 20bn to reach the most remote
parts of the country. The phone companies are concerned about getting a
return on that investment. Operating the superhighway profitably will not be
as easy as on the existing copper networks - and for that reason, the phone
companies are reluctant to invest in the fibre infrastructure until they are
sure of getting a return.
Industry experts argue that the present method of charging for calls - where
prices are determined by the distance of the call and the capacity of the
line - cannot be sustained on a fibre network - 'when you have fibre in the
local loop, you have an infinite supply of capacity. For anyone to sell that
on a bandwidth related tariff is a nonsense,' says Malcolm Matson, chairman
of National Telecable.
BT is exploring new ways of tariffing as part of a trial of multimedia
services in Ipswich, Suffolk. John Drew, of BT's corporate strategy
department, recognises that changes will be needed - 'we don't want to be
constrained by 80 years of existing tariff structures.' Hepoints out that
the information superhighway is not the same as the phone service as we know
it today. The difference lies in who provides the content - 'in voice
telephony, it's simple: the users generate the content. In multimedia, the
users do not generate the content. They access it on a service.'
In commercial terms, the cost of providing voice telephony is the cost of
the line. On a superhighway, the providers of the service want payment, and
therefore the cost of the service embraces the content as well as the line.
Mr Matson believes the solution is to separate the ownership of the fibre
infrastructure from the service provision. Such a structure, not unlike the
current set-up for mobile communications in the UK, would provide more
flexibility for service pricing.
'The separation of infrastructure from service provision is certainly where
the industry is going to end up. But it is not something the telephone
companies will do voluntarily,' comments Andrew Entwhistle of the
Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, Analysys.
Demand for multimedia services is another concern. In the long term, new
services - ranging from dial-up books and compact disks, to interactive
education could be made available. But in the immediate future, the main
demand is seen to be entertainment - movies and computer games. The BT trial
will concentrate on a video on demand service, as will a similar trial by
Time Warner in Orlando, Florida.
The theory of video-on-demand is that there is an existing market for video
rental, which would be largely replaced by an on-line market. But Mr
Entwhistle casts doubt on its potential size: 'There is a major threshold
determining how much people will spend to get more than cable TV. The
initial hypothesis that people would double their expenditure to get
interactive TV has been exploded. There's not much evidence that people will
do that.'
John Drew believes that superhighways will actually need to begin with a
much more familiar service: broadcast entertainment. It would be a more
obvious wedge to put in the consumer's door, and one from which to introduce
the new multimedia services in a gradual way. This is why BT, for example,
insists it wants its licence altered to permit it to carry broadcast
entertainment before it will install fibre to every home. The phone
companies therefore question the political assumption about people's right
to have access to the superhighway - especially if the phone companies, not
national governments, are to foot the bill: 'What service do people have a
right to?' asks Mr Drew.
The idea that everyone has a right to phone services stems from the days
when the phone network was in its infancy. The telephone gave people a
facility to communicate with others. The super-highway, however, looks like
being primarily a medium of entertainment: thus, there is a case that the
commercial market should dictate who gets it. Put in simple terms, people do
not have the automatic right to dial-up Madonna movies. And if people do not
have a right to it, and there is no clear profit in it, they won't get it.
In the UK, the Telecommunications Users Association is pessimistic about the
chances of fibre connections to every home - 'realistically, it will never
happen,' says John Skarratt, TUA director.
However, the phone companies are pursuing a technical alternative to fibre,
which may provide a commercially expedient solution. Known as ADSL
(asymetric digital subscriber loop), the new technology operates at up to 6
megabits over an existing copper phone line. It is nowhere near the speed of
fibre, but could be sufficient for the entertainment and other
consumer-oriented services.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): New services
abound for businesses in the UK - Call charges fall for fixed and mobile
communications / It could be argued that the success of competition in the
UK has strengthened the case for telecoms liberalisation across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition and new technologies have transformed the shape of
telecommunications in Britain in the ten years since British
Telecommunications was privatised. New network operators and service
providers have entered the market and prices for both fixed and mobile
services are tumbling.
Oftel, the UK telecoms regulator, has forced BT to bring its call charges
down sharply to reflect the falling cost of delivering calls as new
technology cuts overheads. The latest price reductions announced by BT early
last month mean that, in real terms, UK long-distance calls are barely a
third of the cost a decade ago.
Meanwhile, a new band of telecom companies have appeared providing
specialist value added network services (Vans) such as electronic digital
interchange (EDI) and electronic mail. Others, many of them with foreign
parents, are building advanced digital networks, including some dedicated to
mobile data. As basic voice telephony services become more of a commodity
item, 're-sellers' leasing spare capacity and repackaging it at knock-down
prices, have begun to appear.
In cellular mobile telecommunications, consumers in some parts of Britain
can now choose from an array of competing tariff structures offered by four
competing network operators on four digital and two older analogue networks.
Other competitors offer mobile services over public access mobile radio and
satellite-based networks. All this has been achieved against the backdrop of
government policy which has turned the UK into the most liberalised telecoms
regime in Europe and in some areas - for example, cable telephony - made
Britain a test-bed for the world.
The privatisation of BT and the licensing of Mercury Communications, a
subsidiary of Cable Wireless in 1984 to build a competing national network,
heralded a period of unprecedented change in the UK telecoms industry.
Ten years later, BT still boasts a 90 per share of the total market for
telecoms services in the UK, and according to most projections, will only
loosen its grip by a few percentage points a year. Nevertheless, business
customers in particular can now select an ever-wider range of
telecommunications services from a growing number of vendors.
Mercury has captured about a quarter of the large business market and about
two-thirds of the City of London's outgoing traffic. Mercury - which
initially competed primarily on price - is, however, now facing tougher
competition from a leaner, more aggressive BT, and from new entrants
pursuing the lucrative business market.
These new competitors have sprung up in the past three years since the
government decided to end the BT/Mercury long distance duopoly and announced
its willingness to license new public operators, either building their own
networks or reselling services provided over existing networks.
At the same time, the government went one step further and became the first
country in the world to allow cable companies with franchises in urban
areas, to build combined TV and telephony networks - thus providing direct
competition in the 'local loop.'
In order to give the cable network builders a head start, BT was banned from
offering entertainment services over its telecoms network for a decade. As a
result, cable companies - many US-owned - have piled into the UK market
attracted by the prospect of a double income stream. Where new cable network
operators have offered telephony services, the take-up in some areas has
been running at more than 50 per cent.
Cable franchises have so far installed over 500,000 telephone lines in more
than 30 areas and the Cable Television Association has forecast that
exchange line connections will rise to more than 700,000 by the end of this
year. Although this still only represents a small dent in BT's dominance of
the residential market, BT has nevertheless felt the need to counter-attack
by sending 'win-back' teams into areas targeted by the cable companies.
Nevertheless, Dataquest, the market research organisation, forecasts that
business and residential customers for cable telephony will be renting 1.5m
telephone lines out of a total of 29.3m on the public switched telephone
network in 1997, representing five per cent of the market.
By the turn of the century, Barclays de Zoete Wedd analysts suggest cable
could be costing BT up to Pounds 1bn a year in lost revenues. BT is expected
to recoup some of that lost revenue in charges for linking cable systems
into its trunk network, but it will be competing for business with Mercury
and other new long-distance telephone companies.
Since 1991, more than 40 new operators have been licensed to provide
telecoms services in the UK. Most of the licenses are for specialised or
regional services but some, including a license awarded to Energis, a
subsidiary of the National Grid, are for national networks.
Energis, which began operations in June, has built a 3,500km nationwide
optical-fibre network using National Grid's pylons. Last month, Energis
announced that it was teaming up with Colt, which provides local network
services in London, to provide seamless national telecom services. Colt has
55km of fibre network installed around the City of London, serving nearly
170 buildings and has also extended its network into Westminster and
Docklands.
Colt is one of three new operators now building their own infrastructure in
the City specifically to serve the corporate sector. Another, MFS which was
launched in March this year, offers free line-rental to customers with bills
of Pounds 600 or more per line per year. Its fibre network covers most of
the City and Docklands and is being extended to Southwark and Westminster.
The City has also attracted a growing array of re-sellers - operators
leasing capacity from others and re-selling it at a discount to standard
tariffs, often providing their own switching facilities and direct links to
customer premises. Three US groups, Worldcom, Sprint, and ACC and Esprit, a
private UK-based operator, are the among the most prominent re-sellers.
The re-sellers concentrate on international traffic, but most also offer a
re-sale service within the UK. Worldcom, which set up in London in 1991 and
aims to undercut Mercury business prices by between 10 and 15 per cent, now
has more than 250 business customers and claims to have cornered nearly
three per cent of the UK's outgoing international telecoms traffic.
Competition is not, however, limited to fixed-line services. Britain's
cellular telephone industry is amongst the most developed and competitive in
Europe.
In the UK, the government seized upon the advent of cellular telephony in
the early 1980s to further foster competition. From the outset, two cellular
operators were licensed and BT was only allowed to take a 60 per cent stake
in one of them.
The government's aggressive policy towards competition has not always
worked, however - Telepoint services such as Hutchison Telecom's ill-fated
Rabbit network, based on digital cordless telephony, proved to be a business
flop in the early 1990s despite the financial backing of international
consortia.
Similarly, only two Personal Communications Networks (PCN) systems have been
built, although four licenses were originally awarded. Nevertheless, most
analysts agree that the UK's cellular mobile telephone network strategy has
been effective in stimulating subscriber growth and effective price
competition.
The UK now has four cellular network operators with 2.6m subscribers between
them: Vodafone, launched as a subsidiary of Racal Electronics but de-merged
in 1991; Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor; Mercury
One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury and US West, one of the US
regional Bell companies; and Orange, whose largest shareholder is Hutchison
Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate.
Vodafone and Cellnet, the original competitors, both have analogue and
digital GSM networks, while One-2-One, launched last year, and Orange, which
was launched earlier this year, were the first PCN networks in the world.
Fueled by falling handset prices, aggressive marketing and tumbling tariffs,
these cellular services have proved increasingly popular with net new
connections to mobile networks overtaking fixed network connections to BT
and the cable TV companies for the first time last December.
One-2-One has been particularly bold, offering residential customers free
off-peak calls in an effort to broaden the base of mobile subscribers, while
Orange's strategy has been directed more towards business customers.
As with fixed telecoms, there is little doubt that competition between
cellular operators has helped bring prices down for the first time,
broadened the range of services on offer and helped encourage subscriber
growth. Perhaps, more contentiously, the success of competition in the UK,
has strengthened the case for telecoms liberalisation across Europe.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): US
monopolies under attack - The bottlenecks facing legislation on deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liberalisation of US telecoms is a war conducted on a number of fronts:
in Congress, in the courts, in state legislatures and in regulatory
agencies. The significance of the bill which collapsed last month in the US
Senate lay in its attempt to draw the various strands together. Its failure
means that, for the time being, the deregulation process reverts to a state
of apparent chaos.
However, there are certain basic principles at work. The regulatory barriers
at issue are simple enough: long-distance telephone companies may not
operate in local markets, and vice versa; telephone companies may not
operate cable networks; and regional telephone companies may not manufacture
telephone equipment. There is general agreement that the first two, at
least, should be scrapped or modified. The argument is over the terms.
For the government, this involves a familiar type of trade-off. The Clinton
administration gives a high priority to the construction of a digital
super-highway, capable of delivering voice, image and data to homes and
businesses throughout the US. This can only be done with private sector
money. But, as long as companies are barred by regulation from roaming the
superhighway at will, they will be the less ready to invest.
Before setting all companies free to compete across the network, however,
the government is obliged in fairness to ensure they compete on equal terms.
The snag is that while long-distance telephone companies compete with each
other, as do cable companies, regional telephone companies - the so-called
'Baby Bells' - do not. They are still safe, immensely profitable monopolies;
and as such they form the chief bottleneck in the deregulation process.
In tackling this problem, the authorities face another familiar trade-off.
As in other countries, the regional companies are obliged by statute to
provide a universal service to the public. Their quid pro quo for this is
the monopoly: for if competitors were given free access to the market, their
natural inclination would be to poach business in lucrative urban areas and
leave the original companies to lose money supplying telephone services to
remote towns and villages.
Various schemes have been proposed to get round this, the most popular being
a 'play or pay' system whereby all competitors in a local market would
contribute to a central fund from which loss-making services could be
funded. In the meantime, however, the local monopolies remain hugely
profitable. As a result, it looks as if the regional companies will not
surrender their monopoly status until they are forced to.
This point was brought home by the collapse of the telecoms bill last month.
The regional companies were offered access to the long-distance market in
exchange for loosening their local monopolies. According to Mr Royce
Holland, president of MFS Communications and a vocal critic of the
regionals, this ultimately led them to kill the bill.
'Some of them were more in favour of the bill than others,' he says. 'But it
came down to an issue of whether they would try to hold on to their
monopolies for another year, or try to get into long distance. It looks like
in the last few weeks the monopolists won.'
But the monopolies are under attack, anyway. MFS Communications is a case in
point. One of a new breed of companies known as competitive access
providers, MFS takes advantage of gaps in the legislation to provide
high-tech telephone, video and data services to big business and government
customers, in competition with the local telephone company. Set up in 1987,
MFS now has a stock market value of around Dollars 2bn.
For Mr Holland, the point of the telecoms bill was simply that it would have
speeded up his company's development - 'our approach is basically state by
state,' he says. 'Big states, like New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, are
moving towards competition, anyway. But in a state like Georgia, where we
have a significant position in Atlanta, it will probably be five years
before we get proper competition. If we'd got a bill, it would have
accelerated the move towards competition across the country.'
Another threat to the local monopolies became real last month with the
finalisation of the AT&amp;T-McCaw merger. The combination of America's biggest
long-distance phone company and its biggest mobile phone operator means the
old nation-wide phone system is recreated at the cellular level. The deal
has, of course, been bitterly opposed by the regional companies, but their
chances of blocking it in the courts seem slim.
To add to their problems, the government has decided that the present system
of cellular licences - whereby the regional companies plus one competitor
apiece are allowed to run regional duopolies - is not competitive enough.
Towards the end of the year a clutch of broad-spectrum licences known as
personal communication services (PCS) licences will be auctioned off to the
highest bidder. There is already speculation that the bidding process will
force alliances throughout the industry, the result being further pressure
on the regional incumbents.
Not that the regional companies are incapable of looking after themselves in
other respects. Most of them are conducting court cases to overturn the ban
on them owning cable companies, and the industry gives them a reasonable
chance of success. More speculatively, they are bringing a collective action
seeking to overturn the ban on them entering the long-distance market. If
this comes to anything - which seems on balance unlikely - it will take 18
months to come to fruition.
By that time, the odds are that this year's failed telecoms bill will have
been revived. The regional companies are under fire for having blocked it,
and a number of influential senators are reportedly very cross. Informed
observers who had bet against the bill going through this year are now
betting on its passage next time. But, whatever form the legislation finally
takes, its task will merely be to tidy things up and hurry them along. The
momentum for change in the industry will carry on regardless.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (6): German
telecoms giant roused by call of the new - Supplier profile / Siemens faces
a challenge as rivals move ahead on prices and technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German industrial group Siemens is facing challenges in one of its
strongest areas: telecommunications. It remains one of the world's telecoms
leaders, with equipment ranging from multi-million-dollar telephone
switching systems to mobile phones representing nearly a quarter of its
DM81.6bn sales last year. But there are threats to the group from three
sources: privatisation, recession and technology.
Until about four years ago, Germany's state-owned telecoms monopoly,
Deutsche Telekom, bought much of its switching and transmission equipment
from Siemens and did not drive too hard a bargain over price - 'it was a
cosy arrangement between PTT and domestic supplier,' says Mr Jeremy Ledger,
telecoms analyst at Dataquest. But it was an arrangement that could not
last, as the experience of other countries proved.
By the late 1980s, British Telecommunications, the privatised UK operator,
was adopting more open procurement policies, as were Vodafone and Mercury,
newly-licensed competitors in the UK mobile and long-distance sectors
respectively.
Siemens was not a spectator on the UK scene: in 1989 it bought a 40 per cent
stake in GPT, the GEC telecoms equipment subsidiary and one of BT's
principal suppliers. But it was not under the same pressure at home. Indeed,
the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 led to an Indian summer for the
old regime in the form of a DM60bn Deutsche Telekom programme to upgrade
eastern Germany's antiquated phone system.
Dr Erwin Hardt, head of Siemens' public communication networks group,
rejects accusations by North American suppliers that Deutsche Telekom pays -
or paid - up to four times the going international rate for its network
equipment - 'they are not comparing like with like,' he insists. 'Our prices
typically include associated software, while US operators pay for software
on top. Take the two together, and our prices are about the same.'
However, Dr Hardt admits that the Indian summer is over.
The European recession was intensified for Siemens by a drop in orders from
eastern Germany and by the growing impact of privatisation as operators far
beyond Britain began putting unprecedented price pressure on their
suppliers.
Deutsche Telekom was one of them. Again, the figures are in dispute. Dr
Hardt says that prices for transmission and switching equipment have fallen,
in real terms, by about *something in here (HP) *
7 per cent in each of the last three years, and 'somewhat more' in Germany.
Dataquest's Mr Jeremy Ledger says that prices for key transmission products
have fallen in Germany by as much as 20 per cent over the past year as
Deutsche Telekom has awarded large orders abroad.
Either way, the trend is alarming for Siemens. Last year it reported a fall
in new orders and looks on nervously as Alcatel of France - which has a
substantial German telecoms business - repeatedly downgrades its profit
forecasts. Few question the strength of many of Siemens' product ranges,
notably its EWSD switching system, or its commitment to research and
development, which accounts for some 15 per cent of sales in the
communications divisions. But alone they are not enough to sustain margins
and guarantee market share.
Then there is the question of new technology, notably the burgeoning demand
for mobile communications. Both Alcatel and Siemens have been dramatically
outclassed in the market for cellular infrastructure and handsets by two
smaller European suppliers, Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland.
Motorola, the US electronics group, also has a significant European presence
in the mobile sector, where it is a leading handset supplier.
Dr Hardt claims that the Scandinavian suppliers were 'lucky' that the
cellular boom started in the Nordic states 'where all those isolated summer
homes created an instant demand.' He is convinced that Siemens' 'greater and
superior' R&amp;D, particularly in the switching technologies where a number of
cellular suppliers are 'weak,' will triumph 'ultimately.'
Yet Dr Dietrich Botsch, of Siemens' private communications systems group,
recognises the scale of the task facing the group if it is to establish
itself as a leading mobile communications force: 'We missed out on the
analogue developments in the cellular field, but are concentrating our
resources on new digital GSM systems. We believe we can generate the volumes
that will make us a serious contender.'
Siemens is also attacking its high cost base. It has just opened a software
house in India, where overheads are significantly lower, and plans to employ
1,000 programmers within three years. Within Germany, moves are afoot to
introduce seven-day working: 'Our unions now realise that such steps are
important to productivity,' says Dr Botsch.
Then there is marketing. Like the rest of the telecoms industry, Siemens has
had marketing thrust upon it. The telecoms divisions now employ more than
300 marketing staff where five years ago there were 15. Although two-thirds
are engineers by training, their career development and skills are
fundamentally different from the mono-engineers of old.
'It used to take two years to get from a first idea to a finished
telephone,' says Dr Botsch. 'Now it takes six months. Two years is the
entire life-cycle.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (5): Close to 50
million users already - Worldwide demand for cellular mobile communications
/ In Europe, the Global System for Mobile Communications - GSM for short -
has become the driving force behind the growth of cellular subscriptions
worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Europe tends to borrow most of its ideas about telecommunications products
and services from North America.
But in mobile communications, Europe has seized the initiative and US
companies are doing the unthinkable - they are giving some serious thought
to importing a European-developed technology.
The pan-European GSM digital cellular telephone standard has been adopted by
every country in western Europe. GSM is likely to be used across the whole
of eastern Europe and is already emerging as the dominant technology in Asia
and North Africa.
Since the first GSM telephones were produced in the summer of 1992, more
than three million people, most of them in western Europe, have signed up to
GSM services.
There are almost twice as many cellular telephone subscribers in the US as
in the whole of western Europe. If current growth levels are maintained,
there will be 22m US cellular subscribers and 13m European subscribers by
the end of this year. The worldwide cellular population will be close to
50m.
But while more than half of the European growth this year will be derived
from new connections to GSM digital cellular systems, US growth is accounted
for almost exclusively by connections to analogue Amps networks which are
close to reaching full capacity.
A number of operators have upgraded their networks to offer digital
services, but there is little or no customer interest because telephones are
more expensive and coverage levels are inferior.
US cellular operators will face competition in 1995 or 1996 from personal
communications service (PCS) companies. They will use high frequencies at a
similar part of the spectrum to those allocated to the UK cellular
operators, Mercury One-2-One and Orange, and E-Plus in Germany. But they
have to decide whether to use the same standard as the European operators,
or a standard that is developed in the US.
There is every chance that they will choose the European standard - which is
based on GSM - because it is a proven technology, and because manufacturers
can guarantee prompt delivery and are beginning to derive the economies of
scale to make PCS handsets cheap enough to compete with the analogue
networks.
'There is an awful lot of interest in DCS 1800,' acknowledges Dale Hatfied,
the managing director of US telecommunications consultancy Hatfield
Associates.
There will be three PCS licensees in each region and DCS 1800 would be an
attractive choice of technology because it gives an operator the opportunity
to beat its competitors to the market - 'with all the PCS licences that are
being issued, there is a big advantage in being first to the market,' says
the consultancy.
It believes that, in the longer term, spread spectrum technology, developed
by US company Qualcomm, could emerge as the optimal digital cellular
standard. But the handset technology is still under development, and a PCS
operator which chooses spread spectrum technology risks being left behind in
the race to build new networks.
While the whole of Europe is migrating from analogue cellular to digital GSM
over a period of two to three years, the US cellular industry is pulling in
a number of different directions and away from a standardised technical
approach - 'we have chaos over here in the US,' observes Hatfield.
But Europe has not always acted in such a unified manner: before GSM,
cellular telephone networks in Europe operated to a number of different
standards. Germany and France, for example, chose technologies which were
unique to their markets.
It was this disharmony and the licensing of competing operators - rather
than the merits of the GSM standard - which has helped to make GSM such a
significant success for Europe.
When the two German GSM networks, D1 and D2, launched in June 1992, the old
Deutsche Telekom C-Netz analogue network was creaking under the weight of
new subscriptions. The quality of the service was very low by US standards
and handsets were even more expensive than the new GSM telephones.
Germany, therefore, became the focus of attention for GSM equipment
manufacturers. If Germany had not provided the impetus to get GSM off the
ground, Europe could have experienced the same sort of difficulties in
engineering the market to upgrade to digital services as the US.
GSM also owes its success to the opening up of European markets to
competition. Most countries in Europe retained monopolies until the GSM
standard was developed. The licensing of competitors co- incided with the
arrival of GSM, resulting in a massive surge in demand for cellular
telephones.
The number of cellular subscribers in western Europe, which had grown by
roughly a third in each of the two previous years, increased by 47 per cent
in 1993.
The successful launch in Europe helped GSM to make the transition from a
European to a global standard. Asia, in particular, has turned to GSM as a
successor to analogue networks, many of which are close to full capacity.
In Hong Kong, GSM is now capturing the majority of new subscriptions,
largely because GSM handsets are 25 per cent cheaper than analogue models.
GSM services have also been launched, or networks are being built, in
Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia.
GSM is also emerging as the favoured standard in Africa where many countries
have no previous experience of cellular networks. Two new operators, Mobile
Telephone Network and Vodacom, launched GSM services in South Africa in June
and already share more than 100,000 subscribers. The whole of North Africa
is also adopting GSM.
A rapid fall in the price of cellular telephones has been a big factor in
the success of GSM. When services were first launched in northern Europe in
1992, the wholesale price of telephone was between Pounds 600 and Pounds
l,000. This did not matter in Germany, where telephones for the old C-Nets
service were even more expensive.
But in the UK, where retailers were already selling hand- portable
telephones for the Tacs analogue networks for less than Pounds 100, GSM
could not compete.
But since 1992, the wholesale price of GSM telephones has fallen to Pounds
250 for a bottom-of-the-range model, to around Pounds 500 for a pocket
telephone. Dealers heavily discount the price of telephones because they
receive cash bonuses for each new subscriber they connect to their network.
In Germany and the UK, these bonuses are so large that some dealers are
giving away telephones provided that the subscriber signs up to a service
for a minimum period.
GSM is proving a remarkable success for the western European
telecommunications sector. It has become the driving force behind the growth
of cellular subscriptions worldwide and is now threatening to make an impact
in the US, the world's biggest cellular market.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3):
Liberalisation is bound to accelerate the pace - European progress towards
privatisation of telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Privatisation and liberalisation are opening up new worlds for Europe's
former postal and telecom monopolies (PTTs), one where they have to compete
to survive and are no longer tightly constrained by ministerial dictates
Only a few years ago, three assumptions governed the provision of
telecommunications worldwide: that it was a natural monopoly, that it was a
national utility, and that therefore it was best managed within the public
sector.
Accordingly, state-owned PTTs were the norm. Almost all of them were
monopolies, many of them an integral part of their government's ministry of
posts, and often managed in tandem with the national postal service. In the
mid-1980s, the US and the UK struck out in a different direction. The
break-up of AT&amp;T in 1984 unleashed serious competition in the US
long-distance market, while Margaret Thatcher's government in the UK sold
off a minority stake in British Telecommunications in the same year,
exposing BT to a long-distance competitor, Mercury, which built its own
network.
But the US and UK had few international imitators, and none of note in
Europe. The US telecoms industry structure, with its divorce between local
and long-distance carriers, was regarded as alien on the other side of the
Atlantic; while Mrs Thatcher's passion for privatisatation was equally alien
to her fellow European government leaders. And in the early years after BT's
privatisation there was little to suggest that many people besides the
company's shareholders, who benefited from an underpriced flotation, had
gained much from the exercise.
A decade later, the picture is transformed. Most of Europe's PTTs are at
some stage on the privatisation road. Each country is following its own
distinctive path and some have as yet barely embarked on the course. But the
following milestones are frequently encountered:
De-merger of the posts ministry and the PTT: This step has taken place in
almost every European country. Posts and telecoms operations have invariably
been transferred to a state agency with a management board separate from,
though appointed by, the sponsoring ministry.
De-merger of posts and telecoms: This has taken place across most of western
Europe. The rationale is two-fold: that posts and telecoms are now
fundamentally different businesses, employing radically different
technologies; and that telecoms is more suitable than posts for
commercialisation and privatisation.
The Netherlands is a striking exception. KPN, the national operator, has
retained posts and telecoms - and was privatised in that condition earlier
this year. Some analysts say KPN is the exception which proves the rule,
since the Dutch postal service is one of the few in Europe to run at a
profit (one of the others is the UK's Royal Mail, which is also a candidate
for privatisation). However, most analysts believe the two postal services
to be profitable in large part because they are commercial. KPN's postal
division, in particular, has a Europe-wide reputation for its success in
exploiting the potential for competition in international mail delivery.
Across the rest of Europe postal services are highly regulated, and face
little external competition or pressure for reform. Whereas the EU is
pressing hard on the liberalisation of telecoms, it has moved more slowly on
the postal side.
Commercialisation: The next step after de-merger is generally the setting of
commercial targets for the new state-owned telecoms company, and the
granting of a degree of commercial freedom. Such freedom typically includes
the right to form international alliances, plan investments and manage
resources without close ministerial supervision (in theory at least). In the
case of Sweden, which has opened its telecoms market to full competition
while leaving the state operator, Telia, in the public sector, the upshot is
a company which in most respects except ownership resembles a private sector
concern.
Is commercialisation an unstable half-way house between state monopoly and
full privatisation with competition?
Many British and American industrial economists believe so; and their
verdict appears to be confirmed by European experience. The governments of
France, Germany and Italy all view their 'commercial' telecoms companies as
ripe for privatisation, and only fear of a serious trade union backlash has
led the Balladur government to refrain from moving to privatisation at the
same time as Germany and Italy do so.
The proposition is far from proven. Sweden's experience, in particular,
suggests that the 'dynamic' effects of privatisation can be secured by
rigorous commercialisation, while continued state ownership is not an
inherent barrier to competition.
Telia is also a leading member of Unisource, one of the three new European
telecoms alliances. However, were Unisource to wish to integrate its
operations more fully by some form of cross-ownership between its members,
partial privatisation of Telia would be unavoidable.
Partial privatisation: In most countries with a privatised former PTT, the
company is the largest on the local stock exchange. That fact alone explains
why virtually all telecoms privatisations have been phased, although
political factors have also weighed heavily.
All the EU telecoms privatisation carried through to date (UK, Denmark,
Netherlands) have been - or are being - carried through in stages.
Typically, an initial sale of 30 per cent is followed by the disposal of two
further tranches.
In the UK, the process took nine years to complete. A similar course is
planned with the largest of the forthcoming flotations, that of Deutsche
Telekom, which is scheduled for 1996. Some of Europe's smaller PTTs, with
less advanced networks, are considering the sale of strategic stakes to
overseas partners as part of a partial privatisation. In January, Latvia
sold such a stake in its PTT to Cable &amp; Wireless, the privatised UK
international operator: in return for a guaranteed Dollars 160m of
investment over three years, a consortium headed by C&amp;W will take a 49 per
cent stake in the company.
Greece and Belgium are considering strategic partnerships. Telecom Eireann,
the Irish PTT, is looking for a strategic partner without privatisation, but
analysts expect that any deal might pave the way to an eventual sell-off.
Liberalisation: Privatisation does not necessitate immediate liberalisation,
as the experience of Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands shows. But
liberalisation tends to follow fairly soon, if not at the outset, for two
reasons:
First, because governments, once they are regulators rather than providers
of telecoms, become more consumer-oriented.
Second, because of political concerns about the straight conversion of a
public monopoly into a private monopoly.
In Europe another force is at work - the EU's 1998 deadline for the opening
up of voice services to competition. The imminence of liberalisation is
bound to accelerate the pace of progress towards privatisation, where it has
not already happened.
Restructuring: Privatisation and liberalisation open up a new world for the
former PTT, one where they have to compete to survive and are no longer
tightly constrained by ministerial dictates.
Internal restructuring, including severe cost-cutting programmes, almost
inevitably follow, although they are also taking place within state-owned
PTTs. The degree of change depends largely upon the degree to which
commercialisation had previously been taken.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): European
Union horizons draw closer - Fresh calls for a 'market-driven revolution' in
voice telephony services / The sceptics over European liberalisation are now
in fast retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When, after much anguish, the European Union's telecommunications ministers
finally agreed in June 1993 to liberalise the EU's voice telephony market,
full competition in Europe's telecommunications services market still seemed
a distant prospect.
The date agreed by the ministers for the liberalisation of basic voice
services - January 1 1998 - was still nearly five years away. Five of the
EU's 12 member-states gained exemptions allowing them to keep out
competition for longer still - Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland until
2003, and Luxembourg until 2000. And, with regulatory structures and
inter-connection regimes non-existent across most of the EU, many believed
that a few years could be added to those dates before effective competition
would be a reality.
The sceptics and far-distance gazers are now in fast retreat. Although
little has formally changed since the ministerial agreement, it appears
increasingly likely that liberalisation will come sooner rather than later
and that effective competition will follow hard on its heels.
It is not just the passage of time which has changed perceptions. Other
forces are serving to accelerate the pace of liberalisation and intensify
the commitment of EU member governments to the cause of early competition in
telecoms services.
The three strongest forces are the European Commission, the impact of
existing liberalisation on unliberalised sectors, and the rise of
international alliances between telecoms operators. The three are
complementary and mutually reinforcing.
The commission has been forcefully promoting telecoms liberalisation - in
public and by stealth. Trans-European networks featured prominently in the
Maastricht Treaty. And from Jacques Delors downwards, the commission has
spent the last few years warning of the damage to European competitiveness
if Europe fails to construct telecoms 'superhighways' to match those being
developed in the US and Japan.
Initially, such rhetoric was often accompanied by suggestions that
significant public investment - either by the EU or member-states - should
be devoted to upgrading telecoms networks. The commission soon saw that such
a statist approach was neither necessary nor desirable. It was unnecessary
because the telecoms industry is itself awash with funds to devote to
commercial projects; and undesirable because leading analysts and some
operators - notably the main US telecoms operators and British
Telecommunications, the privatised UK operator - convinced policy-makers
that a far better way of boosting the development and take-up of new
services was to abolish monopolies and allow competition to exert strong
downward pressure on prices.
A mature statement of this new approach is encapsulated in the 'global
information society' report of the EU-wide industry group chaired by Mr
Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner.
Published in May, and broadly endorsed by EU heads of government shortly
afterwards, the Bangemann report put superhighways at the heart of Europe's
future competitiveness. It called for a 'market-driven revolution' to make
them a reality; and to precipitate the revolution it recommended that EU
governments 'accelerate the ongoing process of telecoms liberalisation'.
The Bangemann report highlighted telecoms infrastructure, not just services,
as ripe for liberalisation, citing such liberalisation as part of the
'urgent action' needed to reduce high cross-border tariffs.
With a head of steam behind the Bangemann report, the commission has lost no
time in pressing forward. In July it published an 'action plan'. The title
of the first chapter - 'Towards a Competitive Environment' - sums up the
action envisaged. The rest of the paper listed the regulatory and legal
obstacles remaining to be overcome, and a framework for addressing them.
The next key stage is a Green Paper on infrastructure competition, expected
next month, which appears likely to recommend liberalisation on a rolling
basis so that competing systems can be opened at the same time as the
services to be carried over them are opened to competition. In practice,
this means infrastructure competition across most of the sector by 1998,
with investments targeted at private corporate networks permissible at once.
The commission is also drafting a directive on inter-connection, likely to
be published early next year, and is putting its weight behind other
practical initiatives such as a 'one-stop shop' for companies seeking
operating licences across the EU.
It will not be a smooth transition. Just as they opposed services
liberalisation, several EU governments - notably Spain's - are fighting hard
to delay infrastructure liberalisation. Their only plausible argument is
that decisions on infrastructure should not be taken before the precise
terms of services competition are agreed. But even that line has infuriated
Mr Karel Van Miert, EU commissioner responsible for competition policy, who
has hinted darkly about using 'special powers' to promote infrastructure
competition if agreement is not reached at the telecoms ministers' council
in November.
By stealth, the Commission has been doing its best to broaden the scope of
competition allowed within existing rules. For instance, it has given strong
encouragement to the EVUA, a grouping of more than 30 multinationals which
is contracting jointly for a Europe-wide 'private' network to secure cheaper
prices and enhanced functionality.
Some operators question whether the EVUA network counts as 'private', but
the Commission has voiced no doubts. Most of the leading telecoms European
operators bid for the contract, and the EVUA estimates that the trial
contracts awarded so far could offer savings of up to 40 per cent on
existing pan-European tariffs.
The EU's operators are fast waking up to the implications. Although most of
them remain state-owned monopolies, they realise that they must either adapt
to competition or lose significant segments of their business within a short
period. Their experience in the cellular mobile field, where competeting
providers are now entrenched over much of the EU, has been a salutary
warning to them.
The prospect of privatisation, now sweeping across the continent, is
underlining it. As the more reflective of the PTT chiefs realise,
privatisation is a body blow to monopoly. The government immediately
switches from being owner to being regulator, radically changing its
relationship with the PTT; and since private monopolies are harder to defend
than public monopolies, it also increases the pressure for rapid
liberalisation in the run-up to any sell-off, or in the wake of it. In the
Netherlands, the privatisation of KPN, the state operator, earlier this year
appears set to be followed by the licensing of a competitor long before the
EU's 1998 deadline.
Furthermore, 'private' contracts such as that placed by the EVUA, and the
rise of big transatlantic alliances between telecoms operators, have alerted
most of Europe's PTT's to the dangers of isolation. The larger PTTs have all
signed up to one or other of the three emerging alliances, while the smaller
PTTs are scrambling to get on board.
The alliances do not in themselves necessitate domestic liberalisation; but
since their raison d'etre is to compete in other markets, they increase the
pressure on operators and their governments to concede open access at home.
Telefonica, the Spanish semi-state operator, is an object lesson in this
regard. Barely a year ago the company was fighting tooth and nail against
any EU deadline obliging it to face competition in the Spanish public voice
market. Then Banco Santander, one of the largest Spanish banks, signed a
deal with British Telecom to develop a national private network selling
private and value-added services to the Spanish corporate sector. And
Telefonica suddenly realised it was the largest of the EU's operators to be
outside one of the emerging international alliances.
Telefonica is now a full member of Unisource, the alliance of the Dutch,
Swiss and Swedish operators, which has also linked up with AT&amp;T of the US.
And the Spanish government, with Telefonica's acquiescence, has agreed to
forego its five-year extension to the 1998 competition deadline. It is not
the last such volte face we are likely to see before 1998.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (2): Low
'teledensity' of poorer countries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The chart (above, right) plots GDP per capita against the number of
telephone lines per 100 people ('teledensity') for 105 countries, surveyed
by the International Telecoms Union. Each square on the chart represents a
country. The overwhelming concent- ration in the bottom left-hand corner
reflects the very low teledensity in poorer
countries. Although the relationship between wealth and teledensity is drawn
as a straight line, in fact it appears easier to increase teledensity for
low income countries. According to the ITU, this suggests 'that telecoms
investment brings higher social and economic rewards in low income countries
than in high income countries, at least in terms of benefits per extra
dollar spent.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (1):  It is time
to cut through the hype - Despite the excitement over telecom
'superhighways,' most of the world's population does not yet have access to
a basic phone line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS

<TEXT>
'The linking of the world's people to a vast exchange of information and
ideas is a dream that technology is set to deliver. It will bring economic
progress, strong democracies, better environmental management, improved
healthcare and a greater sense of shared stewardship of our small planet.'
 - US vice-president Al Gore, writing in the FT last month about his
ambitions for a Global Information Infrastructure (GII), based on
international fibre-optic telecommunications.
It is a noble goal. Mr Gore's vision also sounds plausible, so successful
has been the 'superhighways hype' industry. For many FT readers, sitting in
offices crammed with phones, PC screens, on-line information services, with
a mobile handset in the briefcase, much of it has already been accomplished.
But it is time for serious observers to cut the hype and take a sober look
at reality. The fact is that technology is not about to 'deliver' the GII,
and with it a paradise of universal democracy, peace, greenery and long
life.
Most of the world's population does not even have access to a basic phone
line; and that is the best that technology, plus huge investment, is likely
to deliver to even a small minority of people within the foreseeable future.
Mr Gore does not pretend otherwise.
In 1985, the Maitland Commission noted: 'In most developing countries, the
telecommunications system is not adequate even to sustain essential
services.' Now, a decade on, networks remain grossly inadequate. Barely a
fifth of 105 countries surveyed by the International Telecommunications
Union boast more than 25 phone lines per 100 people, with most developing
countries providing fewer than 5 per 100 (see charts, overleaf).
According to a recent study,* developing countries have 75 per cent of the
world's population and 16 per cent of its product, but only 12 per cent of
its telephone lines. As for the GII, the typical Spaniard will this year be
on the phone to someone abroad for a mere 20 minutes, but that compares with
a few seconds for the typical Tanzanian.
Telecoms development is critical to economic growth: a study by the
International Telecommunications Union plotting gross domestic product per
capita against 'teledensity' (telephone lines per 100 people) suggests that
for every extra Dollars 1,000 of GDP a country will have an extra 2.24 phone
lines per person.
The foremost challenge - in telecom terms - for the developing world is the
provision of more basic phone lines. The private sector in the developed
world - banks, equipment suppliers and operators - is set to play a critical
role in meeting it. According to a recent World Bank presentation, about
Dollars 55bn a year for the next six years will be required to build up
basic networks in developing countries and the former eastern Europe bloc.
Whereas in the 1980s barely a fifth of telecoms investment in the developing
world came from the private sector, about half of the Dollars 55bn will have
to come from that source.
In the World Bank's view, the only way to achieve that goal is for
governments to embark on radical liberalisation and privatisation
programmes. They are starting to do so, albeit in a halting manner.
India, which has barely eight telephone lines per 1,000 people, is a classic
study of the forces at work. Western operators, eyeing the lucrative
opportunities for satisfying unmet demand, have been flooding the Indian
government with proposals for franchised networks and competing operations.
The country's state telecoms commission gave them strong support, but the
government, besieged by trade unions and worried about losing control,
dithered about abolition of the state monopoly.
Finally, last month the government decided to allow private operators to bid
for regional licences to operate networks in competition with the state
monopoly - a significant concession, although less than the private groups
wanted - but at the same time moved the strongly pro-reform chairman of the
telecoms commission to another job.
It is a similar story in China, the world's biggest telecoms growth market,
where the country's ministry of posts and telecommunications (MPT) has
fought tooth and nail against any weakening of its position. The MPT this
year lost the battle to prevent other state ministries setting up their own
telecoms division, and it is set to face further deregulation of the market
as Beijing seeks to attract foreign capital to help meet its target of
increasing China's number of phone lines from the present 30m to 110m by
2000. Only in the developed world are 'superhighways' - the upgrading of
telecom networks to take fibre-optic cables to the kerb or even into the
home - an immediate concern. Most of the main operators have built trunk
fibre networks and are starting to extend fibre into the local loop; they
are also at various stages in trials of inter-active business and
residential services, from networked personal computers to home shopping and
video-on-demand.
Again, a dose of caution is needed. Very few inter-active services are
currently available. Most national networks are not yet up to it; and where
they are, the pricing of services such as video-on-demand is highly
problematic, particularly where existing alternatives - in that case renting
videos from the local store - are cheap and well-established.
The 'global village' is similarly inhibited by high cross-border telecoms
rates. Sustained by the cartel of national operators which fixes the
tariffs, international telecoms prices remain far higher than costs. The
cartel is beginning to crumble in the face of liberalisation, the rise of
new forms of competition, and the formation of global alliances of large
telecoms operators aiming to offer 'one-stop' services to multinationals.
But until cross-border prices come down to the level of national tariffs, Mr
Gore's GII will encompass a fairly select band.
One of the most effective remedies for monopoly pricing is, of course, to
abolish the monopoly. Across the developed world monopolies are in the
process of being abolished. The UK, Sweden and New Zealand now have almost
unrestrained telecoms competition: new operators are able to gain licences
quickly and they are allowed to build their own infrastructure.
Elsewhere, liberalisation is proving a fraught endeavour, although the trend
is unambiguous. In the US, Congress failed this year to reform the country's
antiquated telecoms laws. The proposed legislation would have broken down
the barriers between 'local' and 'long-distance' networks, extending
competition in one step and avoiding the heavy litigation which looks set to
continue to be the prime vehicle for reshaping the US regulatory maze.
In Europe, where monopoly remains the rule for basic voice traffic, an
orderly march to full competition is in progress. The EU's 12 members have
agreed to allow full competition in voice services by January 1998, and are
close to agreeing to open up infrastructure within a similar timescale.
Across most of the developed world, competition is already entrenched in the
fast-growing mobile communications sector, with the cellular phone on the
threshold of becoming a mass consumer good. As it does so, operators are
increasingly focusing on the potential for radio systems to replace 'fixed'
networks in the local loop. Such 'fixed cellular' systems are set to provide
low-cost local networks, dramatically cutting the investment required to
provide networks in competition with those of existing fixed-wire operators
and offering new prospects for telecoms growth in the developing world. Some
believe that in the developed world the prospect of serious competition with
radio operators for voice telephony traffic will drive existing fixed-wire
operators to develop superhighway services fast, since the greater bandwidth
of fibre-optics will provide their main competitive edge over radio. Mr
Jozef Cornu, technical director at Alcatel, the French equipment supplier,
says: 'In the battle between operators, those that go via radio will lack
bandwidth, so those with fixed networks will be obliged to develop
multimedia services.'
It is a plausible scenario, and further support for the 'Negraponte switch'
 -the notion developed by Mr Nicholas Negraponte, director of the media
laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that services
traditionally delivered by radio are set to switch to cable and vice versa.
But once again, it does not describe the telecoms world this year or next.

17 MONDAY
Compensation on Kuwait
The United Nations Compensation Commission meets in Geneva to consider
claims relating to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait (to Oct 21). The
Commission, which is sifting through more than 2m claims totalling nearly
Dollars 160bn, will focus on damage to individual property and compensation
for those forced to flee Kuwait. Most claimants will have to wait for their
money until the UN lifts its ban on Iraqi oil sales.
Russian economy: An International Monetary Fund mission starts talks in
Moscow on Russian economic reform, the government's budget and possible
financial assistance for a stabilisation programme.
World trade: Trade ministers, officials and business executives begin a week
in Colombus, Ohio, to discuss cutting the costs of doing business abroad.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the meeting's
organiser, believes streamlining procedures and paperless trading could save
companies and governments worldwide Dollars 100bn a year.
Infrastructure in Asia: Indonesia hosts the World Infrastructure Forum (to
Oct 21). The conference brings public and private sector together to discuss
co-operation in regional infrastructure development.
Environmental groups are due to sue President Suharto of Indonesia for
diverting to a state-owned aircraft maker Dollars 185m intended for
replanting rainforests.
Middle East peace: Jordan-Israel peace negotiations resume in Aqaba, on the
Jordanian Red Sea coast (to Oct 20). Last week saw an agreement to link
electricity supplies between Aqaba and the Israeli resort of Eilat.
Outstanding issues are water and security.
Women's economic and social advancement, including equality at work and
political representation, are the concern of a United Nations-sponsored
meeting in Vienna being attended by some 50 European nations. The five-day
meeting is part of preparations for the Fourth World Conference on Women in
Beijing next September.
UK politics: The House of Commons returns from its summer recess.
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, announces its 1994 first-half
results. It will be its first opportunity to report on actual performance as
opposed to making forecasts, though the results of just over a month of
freight operations will not be very significant.
At the same time, the start date and fare tariff for the intercity Eurostar
trains will be unveiled. Services between London, Paris and Brussels are
expected to begin in mid-November.

Turkic states hold summit
Leaders of Turkey and the five Turkic states of the former Soviet Union meet
in Istanbul for their second summit (to Oct 19). The group was set up in
1992 at Turkey's instigation, to draw together Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan,
Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
The two-day meeting is likely to be dominated by the crisis in Bosnia, the
Middle East peace process and unrest in the Caucasus, especially the
conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
Turkey's grandiose aim of creating a Turkic federation, floated at the
inaugural conference two years ago, has faded. Russia's continued strong
presence in the region overshadows all talk of unity.
Asylum in the UK: Amnesty International's British section
publishes its study Prisoners Without a Voice: Asylum-Seekers Detained in
the United Kingdom, showing that Home Office procedures violate
international human rights law.
Simultaneously, the London-based Medical Foundation for the Care of
Victims of Torture is due to issue a report saying that torture survivors
seeking asylum in the UK are being detained for periods ranging from two to
17 months.
Saleroom: The largest emerald-cut blue diamond ever to be offered at
auction is expected to raise Dollars 8m at a jewellery sale at Sotheby's in
New York. Of an intense powder-blue, the 20.17 carat diamond is also
favoured with good clarity and perfect proportions.
Lost art: The Musee d'Orsay in Paris opens an exhibition of works by artists
including Monet, Renoir and Gauguin, in the hope of discovering their
owners. The collection of 21 paintings and drawings was part of a hoard
taken from France by the Nazis during the second world war.
The works resurfaced in East Berlin in the 1970s and spent 20 years hanging
in the National Gallery there. They were returned recently in the wake of
German reunification.
Phone-cars: Ford is to offer free mobile telephones and connections to the
Cellnet system on nearly all its vehicles sold in the UK from today in an
attempt to improve new car sales. The company expects at least 100,000
buyers a year to choose the option.
Holidays: Sri Lanka.

19 WEDNESDAY
Black Sea energy plans
Energy officials from 11 Black Sea Economic Co-operation countries meet at
the Bulgarian port of Varna for the first working meeting of the Black Sea
and Balkan regional energy centre, which is supported by the European Union.
Most of the members have been moving from socialist-era planning to a market
economy and face energy problems. They plan to co-ordinate strategies, by
agreeing, for example, on the best routes for oil and gas pipelines.
Dynamic economics: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development is to hold a high-level informal meeting for participants from
OECD member countries and nine Dynamic Non-Member Economies (DNMEs) at a
hotel in Tokyo. The emphasis will be 'forward-looking' - how can the OECD
enhance the capacity of member countries and the DNMEs to address their
common domestic and international economic problems in the coming year?
Ukraine's parliament plans to vote
on President Leonid Kuchma's reform programme, unveiled last week. The
resolution is non-binding but will gauge the mood of the communist-
dominated chamber towards Ukraine's first significant attempt at economic
reform. The chamber may also this week set a date for an awaited vote on
Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Saleroom: The Lau Collection of early Chinese and Japanese photographs comes
under the hammer at Christie's in London. Highlights include prints of the
Imperial Summer Palace in Peking taken in 1860 immediately before its
destruction, and the hand-tinted albumen prints of the Italian Felice Beato
recording the people, costumes and landscape of old Japan. The photograph
below comes from an album of 69 prints of Chinese subjects estimated at
Pounds 4,000 (Dollars 6,300) to Pounds 6,000.
FT Surveys: Luxembourg and North American Business Locations.
20 THURSDAY
Vietnam focuses on deficit
Vietnam's National Assembly is due to begin a landmark month-long session.
Diplomats say the rubber-stamp legislative body is convening about a month
earlier than usual because the communist leadership wants to tackle economic
issues such as inflation and the growing budget deficit before the year is
out.
Trade negotiators meet in Geneva for two days in a bid to thrash out a new
Gatt code of fair trade practice for civil aircraft. With the US and the
European Union far apart, hopes are dimming that a deal can be reached by
the year-end deadline.
Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani visits India - a few weeks after Iran
received Farooq Ahmad Leghari, president of its ally Pakistan. Iran hopes to
build a gas pipeline through Pakistan to India, but Rafsanjani has said
economic co-operation between the three states is being held up by tension
between India and Pakistan. Iran is positioning itself as 'honest broker' to
resolve differences between the two over such issues as Kashmir.
Hungarian debt: International Monetary Fund managing director Michel
Camdessus visits Hungary. The IMF is urging the Socialist-led government to
cut spending to prevent the country's high debt rising further.
FT Survey: The New UK Gas Market.
Holidays: Kenya.
21 FRIDAY
Confidence vote in Russia
The Russian Duma has called a vote of confidence in the government following
last week's wild fluctuations of the rouble. President Boris Yeltsin moved
quickly to repair the political damage by sacking the acting finance
minister, Sergei Dubinin, and urging Victor Gerashchenko, head of the
Central Bank, to quit. But many deputies remain furious about the whole
affair and may bring the vote forward to earlier in the week.
CIS summit: Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States are due to
meet in Moscow to debate economic union - formally agreed last month but not
yet in place. Russian-Ukrainian relations will come up again; resolution of
such thorny issues as the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's debts to Russia is
still distant.
German M3: The September figures for the erratic M3 broad measure of the
money supply are due for release. The expectation is that it will continue
its decline, falling from 8.2% to 7.5%, but still above the 6% upper limit
desired by the Bundesbank.
UK economy: There have been tentative signs, notably the August fall in
manufacturing output, that the pace of UK economic growth slowed in the
third quarter. Today's first estimate of gross domestic product growth is
expected to reveal a 0.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise, down from 1.1 per
cent in the previous three months.
22-23 WEEKEND
Kyrgyzstan referendum
The Central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan holds a referendum on
Saturday on the future shape of the Kyrgyz parliament. The former
parliament, a hangover from the Soviet period, dissolved itself last month.
President Askar Akayev has called the referendum with the aim of
achieving public support for a smaller two-chamber parliament more
representative of the population and of the country's regions.
Apec meeting: The Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum starts a two-day
ministerial meeting in Osaka on Saturday dedicated to nurturing medium and
small enterprises.
UK motor show opens to the public on Saturday in Birmingham (to Oct 30).
Spain's Basque country stages regional elections on Sunday. The
moderate PNV nationalist party, a member of the governing coalition, is
expected to emerge as the strongest single party.
Reds on the streets: The Communist Party of the US celebrates its 75th
anniversary on Sunday, with demonstrations planned in 75 cities and a rally
in Chicago.
Clocks go back one hour in the UK and Ireland. They go forward one hour in
Brazil.

Tuesday: The UK's budget deficit has been falling, with economists
predicting a 1994-95 shortfall of Pounds 30bn-Pounds 34bn, below the
Treasury's forecast of Pounds 36bn. September figures, published today, are
expected to show a borrowing requirement of Pounds 4.3bn.

provide the week's first clue as to activity on the UK high street in
September.
Wednesday: UK retail sales volumes are expected to have rebounded after a
weak August performance. But the picture has been confused by signs of weak
personal income growth and buoyant M0 figures. The consensus forecast is for
monthly growth of 0.3 per cent.
Thursday: Britain's broad money supply growth has been weak during the
recovery and September's annual growth rate in M4 is forecast at 4.8 per
cent, near the bottom of the 3-9 per cent monitoring range.
Friday: Analysts expect a slight widening in the UK's trade deficit with
non-European Union countries to Pounds 320m in September, from Pounds 262m
in August. But this small deterioration should not alter the underlying
trend of an improving UK trade position.

FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Attitudes change on Latin America -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>

The return last week of Argentina to the syndicated loan market marks a
significant stage in Latin America's financial rehabilitation. Argentina
secured a Dollars 500m 18-month credit with a spread of 150 basis points
above Libor on Tuesday.
The deal is one of the biggest by any Latin American government since the
continent's debt crisis emerged in the early 1980s and reflects a marked
change in the attitude of international bankers.
'There is a change in mind set,' explains one banker in New York, who says
financiers have been impressed by the approach of finance ministers such as
Mr Domingo Cavallo of Argentina.
'It would have been unthinkable three or four years ago,' explains Mr Peter
West, economic adviser with West Merchant Bank in London.
Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank led the loan, which follows an increase in
project finance and short-term trade lending to Latin America and a sharp
rise in international equity flows towards the continent, where governments
are increasingly adopting the liberal economic policies, pioneered by Chile,
Mexico and Argentina.
So far this year some Dollars 5.25bn has been lent to Latin American
borrowers in 35 separate deals, according to figures by International
Financing Review, the specialist publication.
Borrowers include public enterprises and companies - such as Pemex, Mexico's
oil company - as well as banks and private companies.
Latin American borrowers have steadily increased issuance of new bonds, with
Dollars 12.6bn worth of new offerings in the nine months to the end of
September.
Nevertheless, they find syndicated loans more attractive because the deals
are flexible. Although front-end expenses can sometimes be more expensive,
the terms of the loans can be rescheduled.
The Argentine transaction, which amounts to a vote of confidence for the
three-year-old economic stabilisation plan introduced by the government of
Mr Carlos Menem, was 'remarkably easy to syndicate', said one financier.
'We have observed some enthusiasm for Latin American credits. Banks have
emerged from the Brady era and are now prepared to look at sovereign
exposures,' he adds.
As well as Chemical and Credit Suisse, other international banks
participating were Banco Santander, Dresdner Bank, Bank of Boston, UBS and
ING, alongside a number of local banks.
Argentina borrowed money to cover revenue shortfalls prompted by delays in
the privatisation of several gas distribution companies.
Mr West believes that there will be no massive rush back into the syndicated
loan market but he expects that other 'tailor-made' deals for Latin American
borrowers could be in the offing.
Nevertheless, there are fears in some quarters that in their enthusiasm for
lending to the new emerging markets, bankers could be opening themselves up
to a new debt crisis.
In a recent note Mr Raphael Soifer, analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman &amp;
Co, in New York, points to a steady increase of aggressive commercial
lending to Latin America and other less developed countries.
'Don't look now but LDC debt is back,' he says, with the cross-border
exposure of US banks to developing countries increasing by 33 per cent since
1990.
'As those of us who have followed the banking industry for a while can never
forget, what began in the 1970s as ostensibly harmless, short-term 'balance
of payments adjustment facilities' and interbank deposits, by the 1980s had
developed into the full-blown LDC debt crisis,' warns Mr Soifer.
Mr Michael Atkin, director for Latin America at the Institute of
International Finance in Washington, concedes that Latin American
indebtedness has increased, partly because the internal savings ratios of
Latin American economies are still relatively low.
'It is certainly true that Latin American indebtedness is building up. They
are importing a lot of capital,' he explains.
The total debts of 16 Latin American economies monitored by the IIF amounted
to Dollars 529bn in 1994, almost double the Dollars 274.5bn recorded shortly
before the emergence of the debt crisis in 1981.
Debt now accounts for an even higher percentage of the region's exports than
it did 13 years ago, at 264 per cent compared with 225 per cent.
Nevertheless, he insists that 'history is not repeating itself'.
The continent's private sector is now bigger and more widely involved,
economies are more open to international trade and competition and
macroeconomic policies generally are more to the liking of lenders.
Significantly, governments are not resorting to external debt to finance
public spending, says Mr Atkin.

Yesterday's German election, in which Chancellor Helmut Kohl was last night
heading for a narrow majority, took place against the background of an
economic recovery that looks increasingly solid and an inflation rate
expected to ease from the current 3 per cent this year.
It is these economic fundamentals and the gradual slowdown of money supply
growth which will determine the progress of the bond market, along with
events in the US, once the vote's outcome has been digested.
The bond and stock markets rose last week, with 10-year bund yields easing
towards 7.50 per cent, on the growing assumption that Mr Kohl's coalition
government would be re-elected.
Earlier, however, investors were not so certain and the markets softened.
The prospect of a Kohl victory and the continuation
of deficit-reducing fiscal
policies injected a new confidence into the market. Thus said Ms Alison
Cottrell, international economist at Kidder, Peabody Securities: 'If bond
markets had votes, Mr Kohl - rightly or wrongly - would romp home.'
Even if he was not voted in again, she recommended investors to move up the
yield curve, not jump off. The Bundesbank would see to it that any fiscal
laxity in Bonn was met with stern monetary policies.

Last week's subdued inflation figures enabled the gilts market to continue
its recent rally, so traders are braced for some profit-taking this week.
The most important statistic of the week is probably Friday's first estimate
of third-quarter gross domestic product growth. Most economists expect the
recovery to have slowed down from the second quarter, but Mr Nigel
Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), is
plumping for a quarter-on-quarter rise of 1 per cent. He believes that this
should not worry the gilt market, if growth is seen to be coming largely
from exports.
Indications of the strength of consumer demand will come from the
Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey - out
tomorrow - and Thursday's retail sales.
The Bank of England will publish details of its coming auction tomorrow,
with many traders expecting a five-year stock. The Bank took advantage of
market strength to make two tap stock issues last week, and it was able to
announce there would be no need for a November auction.
Unless the numbers are particularly bad, it is not expected that tomorrow's
public sector borrowing requirement figures for September will move the
market, given the general consensus that the deficit is gradually falling.

Favourable economic statistics and the Bank of Japan's manoeuvres on the
money markets have increased expectations of a rise in short-term money
market rates.
With the new reserve maintenance period starting today bond market investors
will this week be focusing on the central bank's operations and the level of
the overnight call rates. A rise in the call rate above the 2.25 per cent at
which it closed last week, could increase upward pressure on short-term
money market rates.
Expectations of higher domestic short-term rates have resulted in Japanese
banks switching their fundraising from the certificate of deposit market to
the Euroyen market.
Banks are wary of a further rise in CD rates, to which short-term prime
rates (lending rates to first tier clients) are linked when demand for funds
remain weak.
Meanwhile, institutional investors are reluctant to increase their holdings
of long-term government bonds.
Life assurers and other large investors are continuing to buy bank
debentures because they are unlisted and investors are not required to
disclose their positions at the end of the interim term.
This has resulted in rates on five-year bank debentures falling below those
of government bonds with the same maturity.

The US bond market ended last week on a positive note following Friday's
barrage of favourable news on inflation.
Treasuries rallied after the government published figures showing only
modest increases in consumer prices and retail sales in September. The
market was also consoled by news that industrial production in September was
unchanged and capacity utilisation had slipped slightly.
After other favourable economic reports during the week, traders took the
view that immediate pressure for an increase in interest rates had eased and
the Fed would sit on its hands at least until the next meeting of its
policy-making committee on November 15.
With little in the way of sensitive data due in the next few days, analysts
think bond prices will drift upwards.
Few shocks are expected from the figures for business inventories today, the
trade deficit on Wednesday or housing starts on Thursday.
One possible danger point is the Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey,
also due Thursday. MMS International forecasts that the net percentage of
Philadelphia companies noting a business increase in October will have risen
to 17.5 per cent from 14.8 per cent last month. If the pick-up in demand is
accompanied by adverse readings on prices paid and prices received, fears of
inflation could be reawakened.

FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Japanese flop sparks pricing rethink -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's finance ministry is rethinking how to price equity offerings, as the
result of what could become a costly hitch to its latest privatisation, that
of Japan Tobacco, the state monopoly cigarette maker.
The ministry is under fire from both Japanese and foreign securities houses
over the second privatisation issue to go wrong since the introduction of
tough new rules on the conduct of equity offerings at the end of the 1980s.
An embarrassed ministry announced on Friday that there were no buyers for
more than 65 per cent of the 436,666 shares allotted to small investors in
Japan Tobacco.
As a result, the ministry runs the risk of falling Y408bn short of the
Y958bn (Dollars 9.75bn) it had hoped to raise from the share issue. The
ministry is offering a total of 666,666 shares to individuals and
institutions, comprising a one-third stake in the company. At the issue
price of Y1.438m (Dollars 14,631) a share, Japan Tobacco is valued at
Y2,876bn (Dollars 29.3bn).
It is unlikely, in these circumstances, that other small investors will
voluntarily take up many of the left-over shares, say brokers. Ministry
officials will decide what to do on the results of a second attempt to
allocate unwanted shares by lottery. The final reckoning will be on
Thursday, when payments on those shares fall due.
The flop increases the likelihood that Japan Tobacco's share price will fall
when trading starts a week later, on October 27, unless the finance ministry
keeps the unwanted shares. If the ministry fails to step in, a heavy loss
could be on the way for big investors.
That could destabilise an already weak equity market and guarantee a poor
reception for future privatisation issues, like West Japan Railway early
next year and another tranche of the already-privatised Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone.
Japan's equity pricing system, to be fair, does serve the purpose for which
it was designed. It stops companies on the way to the market from covertly
handing out cheap shares to friends in high places, as was the case in the
late 1980s Recruit shares for favours scandal, which provoked the rule
change.
In drawing up the new rules for pricing shares, the finance ministry took
its inspiration for the auction system it has used for many years to sell
government bonds. The result produces a system very different from that
normally used for international share sales.
One third of the shares to be issued are auctioned in advance to rich
individuals and institutional investors. The rest are sold by lottery to the
public, at the mid-price of bids made in the auction.
This drains off all the surplus institutional demand for the shares, before
the issue even gets to the public, argue the system's critics, and ensures
that the first few days' trading will be more likely to show a loss than in
other international issues, which give advisers more scope to set the price
at a level likely to stimulate the market.
Big investors must pay the price they bid in the pre-offer auction, even if
they are unlucky enough to have bid above the mid-price. In Japan Tobacco's
case, bids accepted by the finance ministry ranged from Y1.36m a share, up
to Y2.11m, probably at the top end of total bids received. 'This way, you
get no after-market,' complains one foreign broker.
A second problem is that the pre-offer auction risks setting a misleading
price, in Japan Tobacco's case clearly higher than thousands of small
investors will bear. It only reflects the valuation accorded to the shares
by the biggest and richest one-third of investors, rather than the demand
from all potential buyers.
Japan Tobacco is not the only example of a flotation to have hit trouble
under this system. Japan Telecom, a private sector long distance telephone
operator, was a high profile flop only last month, despite the fact Nomura
Securities priced it at a discount to the auction mid-price. Mass selling
orders for JR East, a privatisation issue, made the stock exchange's
computers break down and hit the whole market last October.
Foreign lobbyists, like the European Business Council, have for years been
urging the finance ministry to adopt something like the book-building system
of pricing shares, used in most international equity issues. This would
reduce the mathematical distortions of the Japanese system, it is argued.
The finance ministry does not usually cave in easily to outside pressure.
But it has a clear self-interest in ensuring a smooth reception for future
attempts to raise government revenue from privatisations, at a time when its
tax revenues are short of target.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: German election sets tone for markets -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges will start their week digesting political events, but key
economic releases will also shape the pattern of trading.
The point of departure will be the outcome of yesterday's national poll in
Germany.
A victory for the ruling coalition of Chancellor Kohl has been widely
discounted by the markets. If this result transpires, further D-Mark
strength can probably be expected, though the 'good news' is already in the
market.
The shock outcome would be a more left-oriented coalition. This scenario
would cause D-Mark weakness, possibly driving the Bundesbank into raising
interest rates to protect the currency.
The other important poll was yesterday's Finnish referendum on whether to
join the European Union. Good economic prospects, and the prospect of a yes
vote, have recently buoyed the Finnish markka, dragging other Nordic
currencies in its wake.
A yes vote would lend further strength to these currencies, though continued
volatility is likely in the run-up to the EU referendums in Sweden and
Norway in November.
In terms of statistics, the key release will the US trade figures on
Wednesday. A number of economists are predicting a large merchandise trade
deficit, of about Dollars 17bn, which could prompt a bout of dollar selling.
A possible counter would be an improved bilateral trade account with Japan.
Some analysts say that the stronger yen, and rising economic growth in
Japan, favour this outcome.
In the UK, the release on Friday of the third quarter gross domestic product
figures will be closely watched.
If, as many economists suspect, they show a picture of slowing economic
growth, this will underline the pre-emptive nature of last month's rise in
interest rates, lending lustre to sterling assets, and sterling.
German M3 money supply, and producer inflation, figures are expected this
week. Assuming a Kohl victory, they will shed light on the potential for a
further fall in official rates.

Nerves are creeping into the market, as external influences combine with a
growing realisation that south-east Asia does not have a monopoly on
economic growth, writes Louise Lucas.
The week will again begin with the absorption of the latest US data, with
brokers looking at capacity utilisation for clues on forthcoming movements
in interest rates, which could feed through to Hong Kong. Concerns are also
spreading from across the border. Shanghai suffered another volatile week,
in spite of official assurances of the robust health of China's leader, Deng
Xiaoping.
Meanwhile, a trickle of unit trust redemptions is sparking fears of a more
widespread sell-off in Hong Kong. Investors are discovering growth in their
own home markets, not least the US, as well as other emerging markets such
as South America, eastern Europe and India.

Subscribers who have been reallocated Japan Tobacco shares for the second
round of sales have until Thursday to purchase the stock. The ministry of
finance announced last week that 66.2 per cent of the Japan Tobacco shares
offered had been unsold. Mr Jason James at James Capel expects, however,
that investors will remain unenthusiastic, and that Y300bn of the issue will
remain unsold.
While Japan Tobacco's saga has had little impact on the broader stock
market, the ministry has yet to decide whether to release the unsold shares
on to the secondary market following the listing of JT on October 27. Any
such move this week could dent investor confidence.
Meanwhile, earnings revisions will continue to exert an influence on share
prices this week, as will the yen's movements.

<TEXT>
The South African markets will be focusing on the release of the major gold
producers' quarterly results this week, including Anglo-American,
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments and Gengold, writes Mark Suzman .
The country's other major mining house, Gold Fields of South Africa,
reported last week. It showed improved profits and attributed them to a
fall-off in the election-related unrest and work stoppages that had dented
the June figures. Following the successful resolution of this year's wage
negotiations, the other mining companies are also expected to have boosted
production on the quarter, which should cheer investors.
Whether the results have a significant effect on the stock market, however,
is largely dependent on the fluctuating gold price. In recent months, the
bourse's All Gold Index has been rising steadily on the back of an improving
gold price.
However, after the metal failed to breach the psychologically important
Dollars 400 an ounce barrier, speculators have started to sell and in the
past two weeks it has since tumbled back below Dollars 390 on the back of
profit-taking. Gold shares have largely followed the metal's downward trend
and are currently well off their September peaks.

The market continues to be volatile, although most commentators have an
overweight position, favouring France over Germany on a medium to long-term
view, writes John Pitt. SG Warburg is overweight in the consumer sector, and
it also likes the luxury end of the sector, such as LVMH.
However, within the luxury segment, Remy Cointreau, due to release half-year
results this week, is less favoured by brokers. James Capel has downgraded
the stock to hold, given the drain on profits due to heavy investment in
upgrading its distribution network.

The November trading account, which starts today, will be marked by several
capital increases, the largest being that of Credito Italiano, which is
launching a rights issue, priced at L1,500, to raise more than L1,000bn.
UBS notes that Credito is following in the steps of BCI, which raised money
after the summer and, like BCI, is talking of a possible large acquisition.
'Rumours are already beginning to circulate about various possible targets
and, with the improvement of banking margins in the second half of this
year, this would help to lift the banking sector out of its doldrums.'
Meanwhile, Milan's new Mib 30 index, to be used as a base for futures
contracts, is launched today calculated on a basket of 30 blue chip shares.
The index will be adjusted every five minutes and every minute when the
futures contract is in place.
The base value of the Mib 30 was set at 10,000 using the value of December
31 1992. Further measurements are based on the existing BCI-30 index run by
Banca Commerciale Italiana.
The new index will be assessed daily from start of negotiations and will
finish with the end of contract cancellations.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets Markets: Final quarter promises more gains -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly, the UK stock market looks a more confident place and the final
quarter of the year offers a more promising prospect. Since the beginning of
October, the market has recovered by about 5.7 per cent after its prolonged
setback over the previous month and, more importantly, the gilt-equity yield
ratio has returned to around 2.19 times.
The first question on the lips of every market analyst is whether the market
rebound will carry it up to those optimistic year-end targets set up earlier
in the year. This would require a further gain of well over 8 per cent from
Friday night's levels, so it may be a little early to start cheering.
The technicians, as always, sound cautious. Derivative Securities, the
futures market specialist, having correctly pointed out that the market was
markedly oversold at the end of last week, is now wary of the steepness of
the sudden rise; 'far too steep to be sustained for too long', it comments.
If the market breaks out above the Footsie 3,110-3,135 band, Derivative
Securities sees the next line of resistance at 3,175-3,220. Still a fair
distance away from those 3,400-3,600 Footsie year-end forecasts on record.
The view consolidating among analysts is that the market has been
over-estimating the dangers of inflation and the interest rate fears which
go with them. '. . . the implied risk embedded in the valuations of gilts
and equities is way too high,' summarises Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse
Tilney, adding bluntly that the belief that base rates could move a further
1 per cent higher this year 'was wrong'. The strategy team at Yamaichi puts
it even more strongly, saying the latest inflation data indicates that the
previous figures were 'probably an aberration'.
This sea change in views on inflation has been inspired by the US as well as
developments at home. Linked to expectations of a broadly neutral Budget
next month - at the Conservative conference, the chancellor of the exchequer
stood fast against premature tax cuts - the likelihood of a further recovery
in gilts this week is rated highly. And, as equity strategists have argued
for many weeks, recovery in bonds is the required basis for a recovery in
equities.
Markets have remained highly volatile, and investors would be wrong to
ignore this just because the trend has been upward, for a change. This week
and the week following present a host of hurdles in the shape of global and
domestic economic data.
Also overhanging investors will be the prospects for the November budget and
the likelihood that an important by-election will shortly test the nerves as
well as the political ratings of Mr Major's government. The market may have
to struggle hard for that final 8 per cent gain.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Market hampers Taiwan financial ambitions
 -The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taiwan wants to use its economic might to become a regional financial
centre.
However having a stock market that is highly restrictive to foreign
investment, dominated by insiders and subject to political interference
poses a formidable obstacle to such ambitions.
The problem has been brought sharply into focus by a recent string of share
payments defaults which upset the stock market and sparked accusations of
lax regulation and involvement of politicians and officials.
'This kind of event has happened repeatedly. We hope this time the
government can institute reforms to prevent it from happening again,' said
Mr Daniel Chen, chief economist at ChinaTrust Commercial Bank.
'The authorities need to to re-examine the whole system, to re-examine the
regulatory framework to see whether the securities and exchange commission
has enough power and tools to monitor and regulate the stock market
effectively.'
Shares fell by nearly 15 per cent only to rebound 8 per cent last week
following the crisis which involved 28 securities houses and a total of
TDollars 7.6bn in bounced cheques. On Saturday the market rose almost 2 per
cent.
Mr Day Linin, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, called on
the central bank to relax barriers to foreign investment, arguing that funds
managed by overseas institutions had proven to be a force for stability in
the market.
Foreign investors continued buying heavily into blue chip shares, helping
counter the index's slide, despite panic selling by domestic investors.
Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the central bank, ruled out lifting ceilings
on foreign investment, citing concerns over the effect of capital flows on
the exchange rate. Analysts say government officials privately fear a covert
influx of 'red' Chinese money and that foreign investors would take
short-term profits.
Taiwan is one of the biggest stock markets among the emerging economies of
Asia with a total market capitalisation of Dollars 209.2bn at the end of
September. At that time direct investment by government approved foreign
institutions stood at Dollars 4.49bn or 2.15 per cent of total market
capitalisation.
The central bank imposes a ceiling of Dollars 7.5bn on foreign institutional
funds which may be paid into the country for direct investment in local
shares. Foreign individuals are barred from investing.
As of October 14, Taiwan authorities had approved investment quotas for 76
foreign institutions totalling Dollars 6.44bn, of which Dollars 4.78bn had
been taken up. Pending applications amounted to Dollars 3.31bn, mostly
awaiting central bank approval.
Speculative share trading by associates of Mr Oung Ta-ming, head of the
Hualon group and the local market's most notorious stock player, triggered
the recent incident.
However evidence uncovered so far suggests that as many as thirty
legislators, mostly from the ruling party, as well as government officials,
may have played a part in the crisis.
One of the main problems, according to analysts, is that the SEC, which
falls under the ministry of finance, does not have the independence and
authority it needs to regulate the stock market effectively.
It cannot investigate or prosecute trading irregularities but must rely on
the justice ministry's investigation bureau and the courts. And despite the
best intentions of securities regulators such as Mr Day, who is widely
respected and considered above reproach, investigations can be subject to
political interference.
'It wouldn't matter so much if the government here took a hands-off
approach, but on paper this is a heavily regulated market,' said a analyst
at a foreign securities house.
Calls for reform are largely drowned out amid the din of recriminations as
political parties seek to discredit one another ahead of elections on
December 3. Analysts say that reform is in any case unlikely in the absence
of political will on the part of the ruling Nationalist party, or
Kuomintang, which directly or indirectly controls much of the country's
finance and industry.
'Everyone knows the KMT itself is the biggest insider trader in this
market,' said a Taiwanese stock analyst.
Furthermore, analysts say, the ruling party is spending vast sums to finance
its candidates in elections, which it views as critical to countering the
growing power of opposition parties.
Some of the funds come directly from KMT coffers but legislators are tacitly
encouraged to find their own financing, and the quickest way to make make
money is from the stock market.
Analysts say Mr Oung was in effect acting as fund manager for politicians,
officials and other wealthy individuals who cannot be seen investing in the
stock market under their own names. 'Oung Ta-ming is a magician with money.
If you give him a dollar one day, he will come back two weeks later with ten
dollars,' said a Taiwanese investment banker.
The source of Mr Oung's magic touch is the wide and loyal following he has
cultivated among the gambling-mad small investors who dominate trading on
Taiwan's bourse. At the height of the market in the early 1990s, there were
4m trading accounts out of a population of 20m.
Ironically, it was Mr Oung's reputation as the patron saint of the small
investor that carried him to victory when he stood for election to
parliament two years ago, just after a similar share payment default crisis
linked to his group.
The advent of foreign investment, first permitted in 1991, is slowly
changing the character of the market, analysts say. The foreign-managed
funds tend to buy blue chip industrials and avoid overpriced financial
issues or speculative shares.
Recently domestic investors have taken an interest in those stocks preferred
by foreign investors, dubbing them 'foreign concept' stocks.
'Hualon is living in the past,' said Mr Ben Chen, managing director of the
Taiwan office of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 'They still believe if they ramp
share prices high enough retail investors will jump in. But in the past year
investors have mostly been pursuing stocks with a good fundamental story.'
Analysts believe that as the proportion of institutional investment, be it
foreign or domestic, in Taiwan's stock market increases, share prices will
be less susceptible to the manipulations of a handful of speculators. It is
hoped that small investors will learn from repeated scandals and avoid
speculative shares.
Meanwhile, the outlook for Taiwan's stock market is positive, marred only by
uncertainties surrounding the demise of Deng Xiaoping of China. There are
also concerns that both formal and informal lenders will tighten credit in
the wake of the recent cheque defaults scandal.
Nonetheless, the economy remains strong with economic growth forecast to top
6 per cent this year. Corporate earnings growth for blue chip companies
should average 15 per cent in 1995, and in the near term the government is
expected to sustain the index leading up to the elections in December.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Further rise likely to meet resistance - New
York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's barrage of economic data was not quite a clean sweep for the
bulls, but four out of five winners were more than enough to soothe Wall
Street's interest rate woes, at least for the time being.
Nevertheless, analysts say stocks may have difficulty making much headway
this week, even though the third-quarter reporting season is in full swing.
Part of the reason is the market surged during most of last week. Since the
release of surprisingly timid employment data during the first week of the
month, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has appreciated nearly 3 per cent.
The impression of moderating economic growth imparted from the jobs report
was reinforced last week by news of a downturn in producer prices, a tame
reading on the consumer level and stagnant output by US factories and mines.
Best of all, the rate at which the industrial sector was utilising its total
capacity slipped, suggesting inflation would stay benign in the coming
months. Only September retail sales came in a bit stronger than expected.
The prospect of an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term
rates now seems remote. Thus, monetary policy has joined Haiti, Kuwait and
US-Japanese trade relations on the list of threats which have receded as
immediate concerns. Most economists believe the Fed will wait until after
the November elections before tightening its policy.
But the market may have already expended its potential to trade higher on
the relief. The Dow has been brushing against technical resistance at the
3,910 level while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 will have
difficulty breaking through the 470 mark. On Friday, it closed at 469.10.
'It's hard to see what will push the market higher in the short run, outside
of good earnings news,' says Mr James Solloway, an analyst at Argus Research
in New York. 'The trouble is, it's hard to judge how much of the improved
earnings is already built into share prices.'
Last week, investors' expectations were mostly vindicated but strong
performances did not always translate into big gains in share values.
Chrysler was the first of the Big Three car makers to release third-quarter
results, announcing a 55 per cent profits rise. But its shares improved only
slightly.
This week General Motors is expected to publish its results. Some analysts
fear its key North American operations will post a loss, though a robust
bottom line is widely forecast.
IBM's third-quarter results, still the computer groups' bellwether, are also
due. Wall Street expects to see continued progress from the company, which
was running at a loss a year ago.

CHINA
New rules for rights issues by listed companies are expected to help
stabilise the Shanghai and Shenzhen equity markets whose A share indices,
directed at domestic investors, were highly volatile last week. All rights
issues must now be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in
addition to local governments, which previously had the final say.
HUNGARY
Quaestor Befektetesi Alapkezelo, the Hungarian investment management house,
plans to launch a five-year property fund, the Quaestor Property Investment
Fund, this week. The fund will use the money for buying lands and setting up
residential districts, mostly around Budapest.
PHILIPPINES
The World Bank's International Finance Corporation and the government-owned
Land Bank of the Philippines have injected an additional 100m pesos into All
AsiaCapital and Trust. The infusion, which gives IFC a 10 per cent stake and
Land Bank 8.33 per cent, will help the investment house diversify into
mutual funds and venture capital. All AsiaCapital is involved in corporate
finance, underwriting, securities dealing, loan syndication, trust services,
leasing, consumer financing and strategic investment.
CHILE
Telex-Chile SA is to raise between Dollars 100m and Dollars 110m through an
issue of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) this month. The company plans
to place a total of 9.35m shares with each ADR equivalent to two shares.
Most of the funds raised by the ADR placement will be used for investment
abroad.
Lead manager for the international offering is Goldman Sachs.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Strong overseas interest in Swedish
privatisation - International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International investors will soon be able to invest in Stadshypotek,
Sweden's largest mortgage lender, currently being privatised by the Swedish
government.
The international equity portion of the deal may be smaller than originally
anticipated by bankers advising the government. But there are hopes that
overseas investors could buy up to Dollars 300m of shares, making the deal
one of Scandinavia's - and possibly one of Europe's - biggest international
equity offerings this year.
This could be one of the last opportunities for some time for investors to
obtain privatised Swedish stock because the newly-elected Social Democrat
administration is less committed to state sell-offs than its predecessor.
'The current government has made no commitment to a privatisation programme.
We will see a hiatus with no new paper coming through. The flow of paper
will dry up for a while,' said Mr John St John, director of equity capital
markets at Kleinwort Benson, which is joint global co-ordinator of the deal
with Alfred Berg.
Kleinwort and Alfred Berg are co-leads for the US tranche, with Salomon
Brothers as co-manager. The tranche for the rest of the world, including
Sweden, involves Goldman Sachs, UBS, Cazenove, Nomura, Indosuez, JP Morgan
and Dresdner.
Overall, Stadshypotek, a mutual company which controls about a third of the
Swedish mortgage market, aims to raise SKr3bn in an international and
domestic offering.
Bankers are impressed by overseas interest. 'I have been astonished at the
interest from big, blue-chip institutions, both in Europe and the US,' said
Mr Jakob Kinde, director of corporate finance at Kleinwort Benson.
Kleinwort Benson was brought in after its success with the sale of Abbey
National, the UK building society, and the 1993 demutualisation of
Foreningsbanken, the Swedish farmers' bank. Mr Kinde says Stadshypotek
represents good value. 'This is a low-risk business with high earnings
ability.'
Bankers had hoped there would be Dollars 500m for international investors,
but the domestic take-up has so far been higher than expected, partly
because Swedish home owners and corporate borrowers are being offered free
shares to tempt them to invest in Sweden's largest initial public offer.
This means the precise size of the international offering will not be known
until the sale offer for the domestic side - described by Mr Kinde as a
'rights issue to mortgage holders' - closes on October 21.
Kleinwort has introduced a unique and complicated structure for the domestic
side of the Stadshypotek deal.
Borrowers who have mortgages with the Stadshypotek will be given 37.5m
shares currently owned by the state-owned Stadshypotekskassan or Urban
Mortgage Bank, for free. They will also be offered the right to buy a total
of 37.5m new shares at SKr80 a share.
The bigger their mortgage, the more new shares they can buy. The UMB shares
were trading at around SKr90 each on Friday. About half of Stadshypotek's
760,000 mortgage holders are property companies which may not subscribe to
the rights, and their entitlement will form the basis of the international
tranche.
The UMB owns all 80m of the existing Stadshypotek shares. After the capital
increase its shareholding will be cut to 36 per cent. All the SKr3bn raised
from the rights issue will go to boost the balance sheet of Stadshypotek,
allowing it to obtain better terms when it begins to borrow in its own name
at the start of next year.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The Markets: Lead and zinc group meets - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leaders of the world's lead and zinc industries, who have been meeting in
Vienna over the weekend, today begin the 39th full session of the
International Lead and Zinc Study Group.
The session, which continues tomorrow, follows committee meetings among the
300 government and industry participants. Many will have been continuing
debates begun at last week's London Metals Week on the influence on metal
markets of the influx over the past two years of money from international
investment funds, which have come to regard commodities as a long-term asset
to be traded as alternatives to traditional securities such as equities and
bonds.
The distortions this has entailed will be a factor when the study group
considers demand and prices for the two sister metals.
A report published last week by Billiton Metals said both metals were
'poised to derive significant benefits from the period of synchronised
growth emerging in the major industrialised economies'.
'On the production side,' it said, 'mine cutbacks have resulted in
substantial shortfalls of concentrate (an intermediate material). In 1993
contained zinc output fell by some 450,000 tonnes (8 per cent), while that
of lead declined by 300,000 tonnes (13 per cent). Further reductions will be
experienced this year, although restarts and new additions to zinc capacity
are already starting to reverse this situation. These will have little
impact on lead concentrate output, and a further deficit seems likely this
year.'
Other events this week include the 1st International Conference on Mining
Environmental Management in Reno Nevada, which began yesterday and continues
until Wednesday. The conference, sponsored by Mining Journal and Mining
World News, will focus on mining-oriented environmental legislation, the
financial implications, the available technological solutions and management
control systems.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: Problems with exchange rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent wild gyrations of the rouble may be a world away from the day to
day preoccupations of foreign exchange markets. But they have been a
reminder that currencies can be very volatile and have the capacity to
spring surprises.
Indeed, the many instances of foreign exchange market turbulence since the
collapse of the semi-fixed Bretton Woods exchange rate system in 1973 have
meant that exchange rate stability is rarely far from policy makers' minds.
Trading in leading currencies has been comparatively calm so far this year.
But this summer's celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Bretton Woods
agreement triggered an extensive review among policy makers and academics of
the current state of the international monetary system.
The first obvious point to emerge from a plethora of conferences and reports
is that nobody is particularly satisfied with the so-called 'non-system' of
floating exchange rates for the world's leading traded currencies. On the
other hand, it is difficult to think of anything better.
The last of the big conferences marking the 50th birthday of Bretton Woods
took place just ahead of this year's annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank in Madrid.
It was clear that there was a strong desire for greater exchange rate
stability, particularly among such international monetary luminaries as Mr
Paul Volcker, the erstwhile chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr
Jacques de Larosiere, the former managing director of the International
Monetary Fund who now heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
Equally striking was the rejection by practising finance ministers and
central bankers of the idea that the big three currencies - the dollar, yen
and D-Mark - should be confined within 'target zones'.
The general perception was that financial flows were too strong to permit
any attempt by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to peg
currencies in a more formal way. With characteristic bluntness, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the UK chancellor, said that a return to targets for exchange rates
was 'not remotely in the gift of the G7'.
The accompanying chart, prepared by Ms Wendy Dobson, a professor at the
University of Toronto and a former senior Canadian finance ministry
official, suggests that pressure for formal target zones may be misplaced.
She points out that 'a fair degree of stability' has existed among the
leading currencies since 1987. Although floating rates are thought to worsen
the climate for investment and international trade, world trade and
investment have grown faster than world incomes since 1983.
But these relative successes are no reason for leaving the system unchanged
if it can be improved.
In considering ways of promoting exchange rate stability, officials have
been looking at the surveillance responsibilities of the International
Monetary Fund.
At present the IMF is charged with exercising 'firm surveillance over the
exchange rate policies of countries'. To this end it examines international
monetary issues and analyses in detail the economic policies of its members,
usually by sending missions to national capitals. These comb through the
relevant data and discuss the results with the governments concerned. The
findings from these so-called Article IV consultations are discussed by
representatives of member countries in the IMF board but generally kept out
of the public eye.
Earlier this month, the Fund's policy making Interim Committee, representing
its 179 members, ordered the IMF's executive board to work on strengthening
Fund surveillance.
The idea is that if countries can be persuaded to pursue sound and
compatible economic policies, there will be less danger of exchange rates
moving out of line.
However, surveillance has been around for some time and has not always
proved successful. Mr de Larosiere pointed out in Madrid that it had failed
to prevent a sharp increase of public indebtedness in industrialised
countries in the 1980s.
The policy environment may be more encouraging today, even though this
month's IMF meetings were marred by a row between the G7 countries and other
nations over a proposed boost to global monetary reserves.
Industrialised and developing countries are in broad agreement on the
policies required to foster sustained non-inflationary growth. With policies
and performance more in line than before there should be fewer fundamental
reasons for exchange rates to move out of line.
There are also plenty of ideas for making surveillance more effective. Ms
Dobson has put forward suggestions for improvements to the existing
surveillance system 'to promote international peer group pressure for sound
domestic policies'. In particular, she suggests that the results of the
IMF's Article IV consultations should be published. She has called for the
greater involvement of the fast growing east Asian countries in discussion
with the G7 nations.
But although surveillance is fashionable, Mr Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief
economist, warns that it would be going too far to see it as a stepping
stone to a more fixed exchange rate system.
Such words will encourage the supporters of target zones: they have lived to
fight another day.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The Markets: Masters of a fragmented universe - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Globalisation is a word heard these days from only a handful of industries.
Once the height of fashion, used to justify the acquisitive tendencies of
companies right across the stock market, it fell from popularity when many
of those deals proved disappointing and when recession squeezed margins and
balance sheets.
But in some corners it lives on. At least two companies among those
declaring third-quarter corporate results this week continue to wield the
language of globalisation unabashed. They do not suggest that the pursuit of
international scope is damaging in itself but they do lend some weight to
the sceptics.
WMI
Waste Management International, the UK arm of WMX Technologies of the US,
which releases its third-quarter results today, is one case. WMI has pursued
growth through acquisition; last year it made 48 acquisitions in 12
countries, and in the second quarter this year another 16.
WMI's directors argue that pollution control is a global business. Last
year's annual report declares that WMI 'has established a strong leadership
in (the) global marketplace' for environmental services, and values this
market, excluding North America, at Pounds 150bn.
It is true that that environmental regulation has been tightening in
industrialised countries as well as in some industrialising ones in southern
Asia. In particular, there has been a drive, both national and
international, to tighten standards on disposal of solid waste and hazardous
waste, the areas on which WMI focuses. In regulating pollution, many
countries targeted threats to air and water first and have only recently
turned to solid waste.
But what benefits does international scale bring to a company in those
markets? Standards are set nationally or regionally; the ability to manage a
landfill in the UK does not imply that the company can do the same in
Germany.
WMI argues that its experience allows it to improve the management of the
businesses it takes over. That is plausible, but risky. The liabilities of
waste companies that have been technically lax as well as inefficient are
potentially huge.
WMI also argues that once it has entered a market it can grow organically by
winning new contracts because it has advantages over local companies. It
can, it says, display to government officials a track record of managing
large scale projects. Its size also reassures them about its ability to meet
potential liabilities; adequacy of financial resources became a condition of
UK waste licences earlier this year.
However, one of the unfortunate near-global characteristics of the waste
industry is that choice of contractor is frequently influenced by special
deals, if not corruption, particularly where local government awards
contracts. It is not too cynical to ask whether the attractions of the
professionally run 'outsider' to such markets will prevail over those
offered by local rivals.
In WMI's case, the question of whether the group's rush for international
presence has left it capable of organic growth is now in the forefront; some
analysts believe its hefty goodwill write-offs and consequently rising
gearing are a constraint to further acquisitions.
It is perhaps too early to judge. The group has had notable success in
winning contracts in Asia, but it is harder to assess its chances in Europe
given sluggish economic recovery. The slump of some 15 per cent in the share
price relative to the FT All-Share Index since its 12-month peak in
September largely reflects concerns about European growth, and Italy in
particular. But the group will be under pressure to demonstrate that the
world's waste industry is not simply a fragmented collection of essentially
different businesses, and that global presence pays off.
SmithKline
Some of the same points can be put to the world's pharmaceutical and
healthcare giants, including SmithKline Beecham, which reports third-quarter
results on Tuesday.
SmithKline's results will shed more light on the impact of the loss of US
patent protection for Tagamet, the group's ulcer treatment. But most
attention will be focused on the integration of the two recent mega-deals:
the Dollars 2.9bn purchase of Sterling Winthrop, the over-the-counter
medicines group, in August, and the Dollars 2.3bn purchase of Diversified
Pharmaceutical Services, one of the four largest US drug wholesalers, in
May.
The strategy, which pushed gearing up to nearly 300 per cent, assumes that
the deals will help protect margins and profits growth as competition from
generic drugs grows and as governments pare back healthcare budgets. In the
case of the Sterling deal, which makes SmithKline the world leader in
over-the-counter drugs and sharply reduces its dependence on the US, that
reckoning looks sound.
According to SmithKline, the worldwide OTC market grew by more than 7 per
cent last year, twice as fast as in the US. SmithKline hopes to use its
distribution network in 100 countries to lift sales across its product line.
It is also betting that European governments, hard pressed to pay the cost
of prescription medicines, will increasingly back OTC remedies.
Analysts question whether the long-term profitability of the OTC market is
as great as SmithKline expects, and are anxious to see evidence that it can
cut costs as promised. But their bigger concerns are directed at the DPS
deal.
It is unclear yet whether the deal will be the platform for the provision of
wider healthcare services, as SmithKline hopes, and whether that concept can
be exported to Europe and beyond. Given the wide variations in national
healthcare systems, it would be surprising if there were a simple
prescription for success.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Beta to launch fund for Cuba
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Beta Funds, a London-based company, is planning to launch a Dollars 50m
investment fund for Cuba and has created the first investment management
company to be represented on the island.
Havana Asset Management, a new subsidiary of Beta Funds International, will
manage the planned Cuba investment fund, which is expected to be established
early next year.
Mr Peter Scott, Beta's chief executive, said its expected areas of
investment included hotels and tourism, mining, food and beverages, the
high-tech pharmaceutical sector and specialised manufacturing. It would
invest in new joint venture companies, existing Cuban companies and foreign
companies with a significant exposure to Cuba.
Beta specialises in spotting new markets and pioneered the creation of
investment management companies in Vietnam and Poland. It has more than
Dollars 230m invested in emerging markets.
The Cuban government has opened up sectors of the economy to foreign
investors. It has signed more than 100 new trade and investment deals, from
oil exploration and mining to cosmetics and textiles.
Mr Scott said the Cuba fund had aroused interested in the UK, Scandinavia,
Switzerland, Spain, Italy and Mexico.
Besides Beta, the other shareholders in Havana Asset Management are Nueva
Compania de Indias, a Spanish trading company operating in Cuba, and James
Miura, of Ninecastle Overseas, a UK investment management company. Mr Scott
said Cuba had provided legal safeguards for foreign investors by signing
investment promotion and protection agreements with a number of countries,
including the UK.
Mr Scott said the fund's articles would not permit the participation of
investors from the US, whose government maintains a trade and financial
embargo against Cuba. He believed relations between Cuba and the US would
follow the same path as Vietnam, against which Washington lifted a
long-standing economic embargo earlier this year.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: US satellite TV group looks to
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hughes Communications,the main backer of the DirecTV satellite television
system in the US, is believed to be interested in expanding into Europe.
Preliminary approaches have been made to the two satellite television
operators in Europe, Eutelsat and SES, the Luxembourg-based organisation
that runs the Astra satellite system.
Both organisations have satellites due to be launched within the next few
weeks but both are understood to be full.
SES plans to launch a fifth satellite in July 1995 which will probably offer
digital services and Eutelsat intends to launch a digital satellite in 1996.
Interspace, a specialist newsletter, said yesterday that Hughes was
interested in trying to launch direct-to-the home satellite television
services to European countries not well served by satellite television, such
as Italy, Spain and eastern Europe.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Electrolux to expand in Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electrolux, the world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances, said
that it aims to double its revenues from Asian countries to SKr10bn (Dollars
1.37bn) within five years as part of its expansion drive in the region.
'Our target is to be one of the major players, corresponding to our position
in Europe and the US,' said Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux chief executive.
The company also said that it was planning to open five new factories in the
region within three years at sites still to be finalised.
Following its purchase of AEG's household appliance unit, Electrolux has
switched the focus of its expansion strategy to Asia.
It has recently launched a Dollars 50m investment programme in the Asean
region and said that it intended to spend Dollars 100m in China over three
years. The moves anticipate a substantial rise in disposable incomes.
'We expect China to emerge as the world's largest market for refrigerators
by the end of this year and will be exporting more fridges than Japan,' said
Mr Johansson.

<TEXT>
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange has cut the price of floor seats by more than
half and reduced its electronic order-routing fees to make trading cheaper
and more liquid.
Under new rules passed Friday, traders abroad will also eventually be able
to join the IBIS electronic trading system. The exchange - accounting for
three-quarters of business on Germany's seven stock markets - said interest
in IBIS membership had been shown from London, Amsterdam and Paris in
particular, and from Switzerland and Luxembourg.
The fee for admission to floor-trading has been cut from DM500,000 (Dollars
322,580) to DM200,000, with brokers' fees down from DM200,000 to DM80,000.
The DM15,000 admission fee for individual traders has also been removed.
The exchange's current membership comprises 138 banks (half foreign and half
German) and 97 brokers.
Mr Werner Seifert, chief executive of Deutsche Borse AG, which operates the
Frankfurt exchange said: 'Our goal is to offer cheaper and more liquid
trading than all other markets in German securities.'
Members using only the electronic order-routing system will pay half the
annual DM24,000 trading fee; the annual fee of DM3,000 per trader has also
been waived.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skopbank, the state-controlled Finnish bank, has warned that it might need
further government support before the year end, in spite of a 49 per cent
reduction in net operating losses in the first eight months.
The bank said its results could deteriorate in the final four months of 1994
if it has to make provisions to cover possible losses from restructuring.
The bank has been the biggest casualty of the Finnish banking crisis,
receiving more than FM17bn (Dollars 3.62bn) in government assistance since
it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991.
The drop in the bank's net operating loss to FM448m in the first eight
months followed a 58 per cent fall in credit losses to FM371m.
The improvement would have been greater but for a 47 per cent decline in
income from financial operations to FM176m. The fall reflects a significant
reduction in lending volumes and a FM55m loss on bonds.
Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has changed
following the restructuring of the Savings Bank of Finland in late 1993.
The bank continues to service domestic corporate customers and also
represents the savings banks in wholesale markets.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Discounting hits Japanese stores
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Earnings growth at Japan's leading retailers for the first six months of the
fiscal year to August was moderate, in spite of the income tax cut in June
and a hot summer which spurred sales of items such as summer clothing and
air conditioners.
The big supermarkets and department stores continued to be adversely
effected by the 'discount boom', as Japanese consumers shunned expensive
brand name products. The leading supermarkets expect further price
competition in the second half.
Sales per customer at the leading supermarkets fell by between 4 and 7 per
cent from a year earlier. Seiyu said that its price index for August
declined by 6.2 per cent from the same month last year.
Even Daiei, which saw a sharp sales increase thanks to the merger of three
supermarket chains in March, said that its low price campaigns boosted the
number of shoppers by 11 per cent, but average sales per customer fell by 6
per cent.
Daiei said that an extension of business hours, aimed at supporting sales,
pushed up personnel expenses and other sales management costs by 44.9 per
cent.
The company will continue its low-pricing strategy in the second half to the
fiscal year to February and expects sales to rise by 23.5 per cent to
Y2,560bn (Dollars 26bn) and pre-tax profits to increase by 4.4 per cent to
Y23bn.
Ito-Yokado said that brisk summer sales due to the hot weather and longer
business hours helped sluggish revenue during the previous few months. It
blamed its meagre pre-tax profit increase on a 4 per cent fall in sales per
customer and a decline in interest income.
For the full year to February, the company expects sales to rise by 1.9 per
cent to Y1,565bn and pre-tax profits by 5.5 per cent to Y86.5bn.
Jusco's pre-tax profits fell partly because of a rise in depreciation costs
stemming from restructuring and the relocation of its headquarters.
For the 12 months to February, the company expects a 2 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y26.5bn on a 10.3 per cent rise in sales to Y1,170bn.
Profits at Seiyu plunged due to cost increases from the launch of new
stores. For the full year Seiyu expects a 4 per cent fall in profits to
Y7.5bn while sales are projected to remain flat at Y1,048bn.
Mitsukoshi, a leading department store with business links with Harrod's,
returned to the black thanks to cost cutting.
However, the company will continue to see the effects of lower pricing on
its full year sales, and it is forecasting full year pre-tax profits of
Y2.5bn on a 4 per cent decline in sales to Y768bn.
Convenience stores, which have carved out a niche in the retailing market,
posted firm sales and profits.
However, the sector, which has been posting double-digit earnings growth in
recent years, has also been hit by discounting, and increasing competition
is likely to slow future earnings.
Sales at Seven-Eleven Japan for the full year are forecast to rise by 8.3
per cent to Y212bn and pre-tax profits are expected to increase by 5.5 per
cent to Y93bn.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record interim profits at
Kvaerner
</HEADLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kvaerner, Norway's second largest listed company, reported far better than
expected eight-month results shortly after sounding a warning of substantial
losses by the oil and gas division, which will weaken overall group
performance for the full year.
The group achieved record interim pre-tax profits of NKr1.02bn (Dollars
154m), up 41 per cent on last year's NKr720m, with four of Kvaerner's five
business sectors showing sharp improvements, particularly shipbuilding.
The eight-month result includes NKr190m in unrealised exchange gains,
against NKr180m in unrealised losses last year, related to long-term
financing of the group's shipping fleet.
The advance came in spite of a pre-tax loss of NKr202m by the oil and gas
division, reflecting cost over-runs on the North Sea Troll oil concrete
floating platform construction project and provisions for future
restructuring. Last year's comparative figure was a profit of NKr266m.
Group sales rose 5 per cent to NKr16.73bn but operating profit slipped 8 per
cent to NKr675m due to increases in operating costs and depreciation.
Shipbuilding boosted operating profit by NKr251m to NKr830m as sales shot up
by NKr2.01bn to NKr7.08bn. Pre-tax profit rose by NKr254m to NKr851m.
Mechanical engineering posted an operating profit of NKr49m, against a loss
of NKr76m, despite a NKr138m dip in sales to NKr3.22bn.
Pulping saw operating profit slip by NKr15m to NKr73m, but pre-tax profit
rose by NKr66m to NKr166m. Sales plunged by NKr855m to NKr1.23bn.
Shipping posted an operating profit of NKr64m, against a loss of NKr40m, and
returned a pre-tax profit of NKr188m compared with a loss of NKr142m as
revenues rose by NKr116m to NKr833m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aberdeen Steak Houses Group, the restaurant operator, reduced pre-tax losses
for the six months to June 30 from Pounds 197,000 to Pounds 137,000.
After a good start to the year, a combination of hot weather, the World Cup
and the beginning of the rail strikes in May and June reduced turnover and
profitability to below expected levels, directors stated.
Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 6.16m to Pounds 6.76m.
As turnover is traditionally seasonal, the company said it was 'hopeful' of
the year-end outcome.
Losses per share came out at 1.2p (1.8p).

FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: DTI will ignore RJB chief's 'bonus'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is not expected to pursue reports of
controversial payments made to Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB
Mining, which last week became the government's preferred bidder for British
Coal's English mining assets.
Mr Budge was cited in a report by receivers to AF Budge, the family business
which collapsed in 1992, for receiving payments without evidence of proper
boardroom approval.
Mr Budge, who says the payments were a performance bonus, has since repaid
Pounds 325,000 to the receiver without admitting liability.
Meanwhile, it emerged that one of the bids for British Coal's assets
included a clause to give members of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers up
to 20 per cent of the company.
A consortium of the UDM and Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the
former British Coal commercial director, is believed to have offered Pounds
510m for two of the central England regions.
This figure included a Pounds 35m payment to the government for the issue of
a 15 per cent stake to the mineworkers. A further 5 per cent would be set
aside for mineworkers to buy through an employee share ownership plan.
The consortium is believed to have provided a further substantial amount to
extend indefinitely the generous redundancy terms which the government has
said must be provided until March 1998.

FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hil raises funds for German plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hil Technologies, a designer of electrically powered commercial vehicles, is
offering 25m Pounds 1 shares at par to raise funds to build a manufacturing
and assembly plant on a former Russian military base near Eisenach, Germany.
The unquoted company hopes to raise Pounds 18m in the UK and Hong Kong. It
needs a minimum of Pounds 15m to trigger an offer of Pounds 45m towards the
project from Treuhand, the privatisation agency operating in former East
Germany.
The company grew out of Hil Electric, which raised Pounds 500,000 under the
business expansion scheme to fund the design of electrically powered
commercial vans. Hil believes there is a potential volume market for
environmentally friendly commercial vehicles.
Its aim is to begin construction of the plant in early 1995. The first phase
of the plant, which would be operated by a subsidiary, Hil Automobilwerk
Eisenach, would be an assembly facility producing 45,000 units by 1998. Hil
hopes customers will include large fleet vehicle owners attracted on
commercial grounds as well as ecologically minded companies and
institutions.
Hil's prospectus has been sent to 2,500 institutions and individual ethical
investors. Closing date is November 30.

FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Parity pays Pounds 8.3m for ACT's systems
business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the Birmingham-based computer services group, has taken a further step
in its transformation into a financial software products company with the
sale for Pounds 8.3m of its systems integration and training interests.
The buyer is Parity, formerly Comac, an information technology staff agency
and services group headed by Mr Philip Swinstead. The acquisitions, ACT
Business Systems, ACT Business Systems (Ireland) and BIS Training, will help
Parity achieve its objective of becoming a broadly based computing services
company.
The total cost includes the repayment of Pounds 3.8m of intra-group debt.
Some Pounds 6.3m will be payable on completion and the remainder on the
second anniversary of completion. The consideration will be met through a
placing and open offer, fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, to raise a net
Pounds 5.7m, The balance will be met from Parity's existing resources.
ACT, which took over the BIS Group last year, has been selling off non-core
activities as it concentrates on software products for the financial sector.
The company is likely to have annualised revenues of about Pounds 170m; last
year it achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 28.5m.
Market worries over the cost of restructuring and product development have
hit the share price, however, which closed yesterday at just over 100p.
Parity intends to create an new division, Parity Systems, to complement its
existing consultancy, training and agency operations. With the acquisitions,
annualised turnover is likely to reach about Pounds 120m.
Mr Swinstead said: 'In 12 months our small agency company has been
transformed into a significant IT services business.'
Parity Systems will be managed by Mr Keith Jennings, recruited from Easams,
part of GEC. The marketing director will be Mr George Waddington.

FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: MMH acquired for Dollars 25m - Tie-up has
come sooner than expected after management buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Morris Mechanical Handling, the Leicestershire cranes, hoists and warehouse
systems producer, has been taken over, just four months after Trafalgar
House, the engineering and construction group, sold it in a management
buy-out.
Harnischfeger Industries, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has bought Morris,
formerly Davy Morris, for about Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.8m). The combination
of Morris and P+H, Harnischfeger's materials handling arm, will create a new
world force in the industry.
The old Davy Morris had been only a very small part of Trafalgar House,
acquired in the 1991 takeover of stricken process plant contractor Davy
Corporation. Its purchase in June by management, for undisclosed terms, was
the prelude to a search for link-ups in materials handling, aimed at
establishing Morris as a world player in the industry.
In the event, a tie-up has come much quicker than expected. The alliance
combines P+H's strengths in the US market with Morris's strong customer base
in the rest of the world. It will have annual turnover of Pounds 150m and
1500 employees at manufacturing centres in the US, UK, South Africa and
Mexico.
Morris has about 750 employees, two thirds of whom are based at
Loughborough, and annual sales of about Pounds 60m. It is expected to report
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.2m for the year ended September 30.
The Leicestershire company has one of the industry's broadest product
ranges, making everything from huge ship-to-shore cranes to hand-operated
pull-hoists. Engineered products account for two thirds of turnover, with
standard or mass-produced products making up the rest.
Mr Mike Maddock and Mr Bruce Norridge, managing directors of the two product
sectors, said Morris and P+H had a complementary range of cranes, hoists and
controls and associated services; the new combined operation would be
extended by Morris's range of engineered cranes and automated warehousing
equipment.
The deal was carried out through the purchase by Harnischfeger of MMH
(Holdings). It is part of the US company's strategy to transform its
materials handling group into a core business with the technological
knowhow, global presence and after-market potential to generate significant
profits.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Property group wins Pounds 251m for Australian interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hammerson, the UK property group, yesterday clinched the sale of its
Australian property interests for Pounds 251m (USDollars 396m), after a
bidding race helped push the price to a substantial premium on recent
valuations.
The UK company, with an international portfolio valued at about Pounds
1.7bn, is now expected to launch an aggressive acquisition programme in
continental Europe, particularly France.
Hammerson has conditionally agreed a cash deal to sell six office buildings
and one shopping centre to Australian Mutual Provident Society. The
properties were revalued last year at Pounds 178.3m, against Pounds 211m in
1992.
Mr Ron Spinney, chief executive, said bidding had been fierce for the
Australian properties. 'There has been a considerable improvement in
conditions in Australia over the last six months,' he said.
The properties last year contributed income of ADollars 27m (Pounds 12.5m).
Mr Spinney said that Hammerson decided to sell when it became apparent they
would require further investment.
Hammerson intends to use the proceeds over the next 15 months to increase
its exposure to retail developments. The company will also seek to bolster
its portfolios in the UK and continental Europe. After the deal, 55 per cent
of Hammerson's portfolio will in the UK, 15 per cent in continental Europe
and 30 per cent in North America.
Hammerson is in advanced talks on potential property deals in France. Mr
Spinney said that the group would seek opportunities in Germany in due
course.
Yesterday's deal was expected to enhance Hammerson's earnings per share.
Even Hammerson's decision initially to leave the cash on deposit would add
1.9p to earnings, Mr Spinney said. The company's gearing - debt as a
percentage of shareholders' funds - would fall from 63 per cent to 36 per
cent after the deal.
Last year the group raised Pounds 199m through a seven-for-15 rights issue
at 285p to bolster a weak balance sheet. The shares closed on Friday at
330p.
Mr Spinney said just two US significant properties remained to be sold.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Rationalise and keep risks to a minimum: Chemical Banking
chairman Walter Shipley explains why asset quality is paramount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a man of 6ft 8in, Mr Walter Shipley does not impose himself, being
quiet, courteous and unassuming. His bank also has a low profile for its
size. With Dollars 166bn (Pounds 105bn) of assets, Chemical Banking is the
fourth largest bank holding company in the US, but is still known primarily
for the two banks that formed it.
Yet 2 1/2 years after the merger of Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Bank
 -two ailing money centre banks whose headquarters faced each other across
Park Avenue - it has started to gain a reputation as more than a product of
a marriage forced by mutual weakness in hard times.
Mr Shipley also appears to be enjoying his new-found prominence since taking
over as chairman and chief executive this year on the retirement of Mr John
McGillicuddy. Mr Shipley, the former chairman of Chemical Bank, agreed to
serve under Mr McGillicuddy as part of the merger.
His statement, in a recent interview with the Financial Times that he was
prepared for Chemical to lose its dominance of the US syndicated loan market
rather than accept loose terms and conditions on loans, was part of a
determination not to squander Chemical Banking's new-found strength.
The most obvious symbol of that is the restoration of its tier one ratio of
core capital to risk-weighted assets to more than double the 4 per cent
Basle accord minimum. This contributed to Moody's, the credit rating agency,
raising its long-term rating to A2 from A3 this April.
Mr Shipley is most impassioned when talking of how crucial it is for the
bank to maintain and improve its rating. Companies are now willing to accept
it as a partner in long-term contracts such as interest rate swaps. 'There
is no single thing I can do that is more important than being the champion
of asset quality. Everything else we do can be overwhelmed by poor assets,'
he says.
Mr Shipley says, moreover, that day-to-day management is affected by whether
the bank is perceived as strong or weak. 'We went through a period where we
were on the defensive, and external events determined our daily and
strategic thinking. We have emerged into a period where we can switch to the
offensive and chart a course and keep to it. The one thing I can impart to
my successors is the power of that.'
Getting bigger without taking true account of the risks lay behind the
problems of both Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover. The banks were in turn
assailed by the less-developed-country debt crisis and real estate lending
problems in the US, and had to sell assets to restore capital.
So perhaps it is unsurprising that Mr Shipley does not see the new Chemical
 -as it is known internally - reasserting itself through aggressive growth.
Indeed, his determination to curb risk in syndicated lending could threaten
its position in one of the few markets it truly dominates.
He sees 'chapter two' of the merger as being primarily devoted to
cost-cutting rather than generation of more income. This is particularly so
in its retail and mid-market operations in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, and in Texas through its Texas Commerce Bank.
Like other US banks faced with the prospect of narrowing net interest
margins, Chemical has embarked on rationalisation. Mr Shipley points out
that its reduction from 430 branches to 280 in the New York area has left it
with deposits of Dollars 85m per branch, compared with an industry average
of Dollars 30m. 'We have been kept busy getting the merger done, but chapter
two is a tough view, business by business,' he says. 'It is rationalise,
rationalise, rationalise. Traditional ways of banking are becoming more and
more obsolete as technology brings new ways to deliver products.'
Mr Shipley professes no great appetite for taking part in the current phase
of consolidation of US banking in which small banks are being bought to fill
in the networks of larger regional banks. Smaller banks are now commanding
prices of about 2 1/2 times book value.
Chemical has concentrated instead on building its product range in retail
banking. This means a stronger focus on credit cards, and the Dollars 330m
acquisition in May of Margaretten Financial, a New Jersey-based residential
mortgage lender.
Mr Shipley is also cautious about diversifying in corporate banking.
Although it is natural for the bank to use its powers in debt securities
underwriting as an extension of its strength in loan syndication, he says it
will take a long time to build strength in equity origination.
'The jury is out on the extent to which commercial banks can truly become a
major factor on their own in equities,' he says. He cites the efforts of JP
Morgan. 'Morgan has a clear head start on everyone else, but they too have
got a long, long way to go,' he says. He sees Chemical's task in the medium
term as a less clear-cut one than Morgan's attempt to bridge the divide of
the Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment banking in the
US. 'By definition, we do not have a singular reputation because we have a
diverse base,' he says.
Instead, Mr Shipley wants to push through operating improvements, shifting
capital into its highest return areas, and gradually trying to push its
return on equity up from last year's 16.6 per cent during a good trading
year to a 16 per cent minimum in bad years for financial markets.
This is not a particularly glamorous mission, but Mr Shipley believes it is
the only choice without taking excessive risk. In the long term, he does not
rule out a merger with another large bank. But the medium term promises a
continuing struggle to reinforce Chemical's new name.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Departure delays leave investors
counting the cost - Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel's often strained relations with its shareholders took another
knock last week when an ill-judged comment from its finance director, that
revenue targets from the Channel tunnel would not be met, jangled investors'
nerves.
Coming just ahead of the company's announcement today of its first-half
results, the news of the missed targets left Eurotunnel's shares down 20p on
the week at 228p.
That Eurotunnel was likely to miss its forecast of Pounds 137m revenues in
1994 has been obvious for some time as a result of delays in the launch of
its freight and passenger services.
But the casual way in which the company appeared to acknowledge this did
little for its image.
Eurotunnel says it is still within the financing limit agreed with banks in
May at its Pounds 858m rights issue, but analysts are not so sure. The
delayed start may have lopped Pounds 30m to Pounds 50m off revenues while
the poor performance of its shares makes it unlikely owners will want to
exercise their 300p warrants.
Eurotunnel calculated in May that it had Pounds 419m for contingencies. But
if the income from the exercise of warrants and the effect of a leasing deal
are taken out then the margin was only Pounds 34m.
The delayed start could put Eurotunnel in breach of its banking covenants
though it is unlikely the banks would force the issue.
Having come this far with the Pounds 10bn project they have no desire to
bring it down.
But this indicates that the company may have to make a third cash call next
year on its bankers and shareholders.
The picture is not entirely gloomy, however. The fares discounting between
the ferries has eased in recent months while the sinking of the ferry
Estonia has put into perspective fears voiced about the safety of the
tunnel.

The consumer electronics group is expected to report full-year pre-tax

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business group seeks Dollars 2m amends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses which paid a total of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.20m) in
retainers to a US company in the hope of raising finance which they say
never materialised have joined forces to press the US and UK authorities for
compensation.
The issue is expected to put further pressure on Britain to increase
regulation of off-shore havens.
The FBI has intensified its 18-month investigation of the US company, Bond
Street Commercial. Law enforcement officers estimate up to Dollars 100m has
been taken in 'retainers' by the company world-wide, or those connected with
it, in return for help in raising finance.
Almost 20 UK companies - from small boatyards to construction groups - have
formed the Turnberry/Bond Street Pressure Group to highlight their plight.
The companies each paid retainers of between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars
230,000 to Miami-based Bond Street Commercial, previously known as Turnberry
Underwriters. In return, they were promised help to raise almost Dollars
100m, in the form of collateral to secure bank loans.
In many cases, the loan was to have been repaid by a flotation arranged
through a company run by the former president of Turnberry, Mr Les Mersky.
Yet no company could meet the terms of the Bond Street contract in the time
allowed. Several companies even paid further retainers for extensions but
still could not complete.
The arrangement appears to have broken down during bank to bank discussions.
In one case, Turnberry's bank was discovered to be an offshore private
institution, the Guardian Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd.
Mr Gwyn Davies, of Cardiff-based solicitors Edward Lewis Bevan Ashford
representing the group, said they wanted 'to draw attention to the
authorities' failure to regulate Turnberry/Bond Street in the UK, US and
Caymans.'
Turnberry and the Guardian Bank were the focus of an article in the
Financial Times last year. Other UK companies have been put in touch with
Bond Street through national newspaper advertisements.
The ads are often placed by US and UK agents. One such agent, based in New
York and trading under the name EFG or EF Gibson, was involved in most of
the pressure group cases.

Business Machines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines will report third-quarter results Thursday.
The world's biggest computer company is in the midst of a broad
're-engineering' effort to boost profitability. Wall Street analysts
forecast third-quarter earnings of about 90 cents per share, compared with
losses of 12 cents per share.
Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, said last week that the company is making
progress. 'Unfortunately we have an uneconomic cost structure but we are
well into fixing the problem.' In Europe, IBM is ahead of schedule in
reaching competitive cost targets.
Stronger-than-expected sales of mainframe computers have boosted IBM's
profitability in the last two quarters and analysts will be watching to see
whether that trend is continuing. Sales of IBM's new Aptiva home computers,
introduced last month, should help to boost the performance of IBM's PC
division, which has suffered market share losses this year in the face of
fierce competition from Compaq Computer.
IBM will introduce new desktop and portable personal computers on Monday.
The desktop models, aimed at corporate PC users, are expected to be loaded
with IBM's recently announced 'Warp' software, which competes with
Microsoft's Windows. The company will also launch new versions of its
popular 'Thinkpad' notebook computers.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Merck promotes money-back guarantee for prostate drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, is offering satisfaction to
users of its prostate drug Proscar or a refund on the cost of the drug.
The drug is designed to treat the enlargement of the prostate gland, a
condition commonly seen in men over the age of 50. The enlargement causes
difficulty in urinating and can in extreme cases lead to kidney failure.
Surgery is the treatment of last resort.
In the scheme it is testing, Merck will refund the Dollars 275-plus (Pounds
175-plus) cost of a course of Proscar if the drug fails to improve the
patient's condition after six months. Money will also be refunded if the
patient needs surgery within two years.
The scheme has so far proved popular, having been taken up by 30 Veterans
Administration hospitals and 11 health management organisations - companies
which specialise in buying healthcare services from hospitals and doctors.
Merck will not reveal what the refund rate has been. But clinical trials
have suggested that 80 per cent of men respond favourably to the drug. The
improvement is usually apparent within two weeks of starting the course of
treatment.
The company concedes, nevertheless, that Proscar, which was launched in
1992, had a difficult start with sales growth slower than expected. It was a
new approach to treating enlarged prostates 'and doctors are conservative',
Merck said.
Mr Vincent Lawson, managing director of the company's UK operation, Merck
Sharp and Dohme, said the money-back promotion was 'a real sharing of risk
with real effects if promises are not kept'. He acknowledged that the
prospect of money-back guarantees might be 'terrifying' for some in the
drugs industry.
Merck said it could be some time before a similar scheme was introduced
outside the US. The US healthcare industry is largely privately owned and
fragmented, with individual hospitals able to make commercial decisions.
The UK-based Glaxo, Europe's biggest drug company, said it was not using
such techniques to sell its drugs.

ICI's shares endured a torrid end to last week, falling nearly 3 per cent in
two days. That was the culmination of an 8.6 per cent decline since the
start of August. Its performance, and that of other European commodity
chemicals stocks, is bizarre because of the global shortage of ethylene, the
basic building block for plastics.
In the US, demand has been so strong that production problems at two plants
have caused physical shortages. Spot ethylene prices, which at the start of
the year were as low as 13 cents a pound, have recently reached 48 cents.
Wall Street has taken this on board; chemicals have been the best performing
sector in the US market over the past 12 months. Dow's shares have
outperformed by 20 per cent, Geon's by 42 per cent, and Union Carbide's by
54 per cent. Prices may pause momentarily as capacity comes back on stream
and a few new plants start up, but the market looks set to remain tight for
at least two years.
For European chemicals companies, any pause in US prices is an irrelevance
because of the low volumes of US chemical exports. Strong demand has helped
European ethylene prices climb 23 per cent in the past two quarters. Such
price rises and volume growth should help generate a bumper third quarter.
Yet apart from the Netherlands' DSM, European stocks heavily involved in
petrochemicals have failed fully to emulate their US counterparts. BASF has
outperformed the market by just 8 per cent in the past 12 months, ICI by
only 13 per cent. It is time for a rerating of European commodity chemicals
stocks.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The overwhelming impression from last week's range of US statistics is of an
economy still expanding fairly strongly despite the good headline news on
inflation. Industrial production was flat in September, but that followed a
sharp gain in August. Cap-acity use dipped slightly but from a figure that
had been revised upwards. At 84.6 per cent it displays little sign of slack.
Last but not least, retail sales still look strong, with Friday's Michigan
consumer sentiment survey showing improved confidence. None of that offers
grounds for a reprieve from a further interest rate rise.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve may have to remain in tightening mode for some
time, whatever happens over the next few weeks. Like the producer price data
on Thursday, the retail price figures on Friday benefited from a sharp fall
in energy prices. The difference was that the underlying rise, excluding
food and energy, was slight-ly more muted than expected. But there is no
guarantee that inflation will remain so easily contained, especially given
the underlying upward pressure on producer prices for intermediate goods and
raw materials.
To that problem has suddenly been added dollar weakness. The immediate cause
of Friday's sharp fall was demand for D-Marks ahead of yesterday's German
election. But the slippage against the yen is also a reminder of how
strongly underlying world capital flows work against the US currency. If
dollar weakness spills over into Treasury bonds, the Fed may even have to
contemplate a rate increase sooner rather than later.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: British Steel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery in the steel industry is in full swing. One sign of this is British
Steel's decision last week to commit nearly Pounds 100m to building a
mini-mill in the US, its biggest investment in the past four years. The
group has also successfully pushed through six successive price increases
since the beginning of last year. Steel prices may still be significantly
below the peak they reached in late 1989, but so great is the operational
gearing within the trimmed-down industry that British Steel's profits over
the next few years are likely to grow rapidly. Analysts calculate that
pre-tax profits, which amounted to Pounds 80m in the year to March, may rise
to more than Pounds 1bn by 1998. The dividend could quadruple over the same
period. In common with other cyclical stocks, the group's share price has
risen well in advance of earnings, more than trebling since its low point in
1992. On previous form, it will also turn down again long before earnings
reach their next peak. The question for investors is therefore one of timing
 -when to sell.
At present, the shares trade at about five times expected 1998 earnings.
This is more expensive, relative to the market, than their peak rating
during the last cycle. Arguably, the higher valuation would be in order if
the European steel industry had sorted out its grievous problems. But the
capacity cuts pledged by manufacturers may be shelved until the next
downturn. This suggests that British Steel's shares are near the limits of
their outperformance, even if the group is set to report buoyant profits for
years to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any sighs of relief in German bond and equity markets at Chancellor Kohl's
close run victory last night are likely to prove short-lived; the markets
rose strongly last week in anticipation of a coalition victory and investors
will soon be turning their attention back to fundamentals.
Here, nothing has changed. The German equity market is propped up by
expectations of a near-doubling of corporate earnings this year and further
substantial profits growth in 1995 and thereafter, but still looks expensive
by historical standards. It is yielding 2.5 per cent for this year, which
does not look attractive in comparison with yields of just under 7.5 per
cent on German government bonds.
The outlook for bonds could have changed significantly for the worse had a
high-spending, left-leaning coalition taken power. With Kohl re-elected, the
government is likely to press ahead with further fiscal tightening but this
alone will not persuade the Bundesbank to cut short-term interest rates
further. Prudent fiscal policy, in any case, will be no easier to achieve,
given the the coalition's thin majority in the Bundestag, and its weakened
position in the upper house.
In the meantime, the focus will be on the usual factors which determine
inflation over the mid-term: the rate of growth in the German economy, the
money supply, and the outlook for next year's wage round. In all three cases
the Bundesbank has plenty to worry about, despite the fall in headline
inflation towards 2 per cent. It will want to see, at the very least,
September's data on money supply and industrial production before revising
its position on interest rates.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Nissan UK chairman paid Pounds 1.94m last year: 514% rise as
company records loss of Pounds 11m

Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK, for whom an arrest warrant has
been outstanding for more than two-and-a-half years, was paid Pounds 1.94m
last year in his role as chairman of Nissan UK Holdings (NUKH) and its
subsidiary Nissan UK (NUK).
His emoluments, excluding any pension contributions, increased by 514 per
cent from Pounds 316,000 in the previous year, according to the latest
annual reports filed by NUKH and NUK for the year ended July 1993.
Mr Botnar is also chairman of Automotive Financial Group Holdings, which
owns AFG, one of the biggest UK motor dealer groups and a sister company of
NUKH. According to annual reports now filed for both holding companies, Mr
Botnar increased his total pay from the two groups to Pounds 5.75m in the
year to the end of July 1993, a 1,189 per cent increase from Pounds 446,000
in the previous year.
NUKH, which had a turnover of Pounds 15.55m in the year to the end of July
1993, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 11.34m and paid its directors Pounds
5.6m in total emoluments.
The company, whose ultimate parent undertaking, according to the annual
report, is the Panama-incorporated European Motor Vehicles Corporation, now
has only two directors, Mr Botnar and Mr Manfred Weder, a Swiss national and
company director, according to NUKH filings at Companies House.
Payments were made to a total of seven directors during the financial year,
but five of the seven are no longer directors. The annual report says that
Pounds 1.028m was paid in 'compensation for loss of office to former
directors' as part of the Pounds 5.6m in total emoluments. The second
highest-paid director after Mr Botnar received between Pounds 1.86m and
Pounds 1.865m.
The report says that Mr Michael Hunt resigned as a director on June 28 1993.
Mr Hunt was sentenced last year to eight years in prison for his part in
Britain's largest-ever tax fraud, in which he was convicted for conspiring
to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 55m in corporation tax.
Mr Hunt's appeal against conviction and sentence were rejected on all counts
by the Appeal Court in May. In July he was given leave to appeal to the
House of Lords, when the Court of Appeal certified that the case raised a
point of law of general public importance.
An arrest warrant was issued in January 1992 for Mr Botnar who is living in
Switzerland.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Royal book prompts ministers to defend monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers yesterday tried to quell public anxiety about the future of
the monarchy after the publication of extracts from a controversial book
about the private life of the Prince of Wales.
Amid concern that the book, written with Prince Charles's co-operation,
could undermine the monarchy's authority, two cabinet ministers and a
constitutional expert launched a spirited defence of the heir to the throne.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said recent revelations in books and
newspapers about the royal family had led to the monarchy's detractors
'getting everything out of proportion'.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the revelations in
the book posed no threat to the monarchy. 'It is the monarchy, of which
Prince Charles is ultimately the heir, which matters, not the flotsam and
jetsam of journalism about personal feelings, however sincere they may be,'
he told Sky television.
The book, written by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby, the broadcaster, was serialised
in yesterday's Sunday Times and contains a detailed and unprecedented
account of the difficulties of Prince Charles's marriage.
The prince said through his private office yesterday that he had no regrets
about helping to write the book, and that it could be regarded as 'a
balanced and thoroughly researched appraisal' of his development as an
individual and the way he has approached his role.
Buckingham Palace admitted that the timing had been unfortunate, coming on
the eve of the Queen's state visit to Russia today, the first by a reigning
British monarch.
Interviewed on BBC radio's World This Weekend, Mr Hurd, who will accompany
the Queen to Moscow, attacked the determination of the British press to
divulge intimate secrets of the royal family's lives. He said: 'I am worried
about the way in which chattering people concerned with headlines and mass
circulation do chip away at our institutions in this country, of which the
monarchy is perhaps the most important and in a way the most vulnerable.'
Lord St John of Fawsley, former cabinet member and a constitutional expert,
said the book was 'immensely serious' and 'of very great historical
importance'. But he admitted the prince had adopted a 'high risk' strategy
by co-operating with the author of the book.
Mr Barry Sheerman, a front bench Labour spokesman, criticised Prince
Charles, saying the book had merely compounded the debate about the
monarchy.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The tigers face a challenge: Increasing regional competition
is forcing Taiwan and South Korea to run faster to stay ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The seemingly unstoppable rise of east Asia's 'tiger' economies is one of
the industrial miracles of the late 20th century. Admired, envied and
sometimes feared, their vigorous export-led growth is often held up as a
model for poorer economies - and a stiff competitive challenge for wealthier
ones.
However, South Korea and Taiwan, the two biggest tigers, have reached an
awkward age. Infant prodigies no longer, they are having to run harder to
stay in the fast lane and to keep alive ambitions of joining the world's
most advanced industrialised powers.
Influential observers in both countries argue that they are increasingly
handicapped by baggage from their past. Shedding it, they say, requires a
radical redefinition of the role of the state in their economies and
adherence to stronger, market-based disciplines.
But although many businessmen and politicians pay lip-service to such calls
for change, it is proving slow to materialise.
'Taiwan is still following tracks laid down in the 1950s and 1960s,' says Dr
Kai Ma of the Chung Hua Institute, a respected economic research centre in
Taipei. 'But the old rules no longer apply. Our whole economic and
industrial strategy needs to be reviewed.'
Dr Jwa Sung-hee of the Korea Development Institute, a leading economic
research centre in Seoul, broadly agrees: 'South Korea must set its economic
house in order this decade. In terms of liberalisation, we are falling
behind. If we don't act decisively now, we will be bypassed by
late-developing Asian economies like Malaysia.'
So far, such concerns have not dented economic performance. Taiwan is
heading for 6 per cent real growth this year, and Korea for more than 8 per
cent. Both enjoy negligible unemployment, buoyant exports and robust capital
investment, while their stock markets have recently hit new highs.
However, new challenges are crowding in from all sides. The most pressing is
fiercer regional competition. Countries such as China, Malaysia and
Thailand, with wage levels as low as one-tenth of those in Korea and Taiwan,
are undercutting them in older industries such as textiles and shoes - and
may soon do so in newer ones like petrochemicals and steel.
The result is a shift of more labour-intensive production out of the tigers.
Taiwan has lost 12 per cent of its manufacturing jobs since the late 1980s,
as more than 20,000 companies have moved productive assets estimated at
Dollars 20bn to mainland China.
The impact has been less dramatic in Korea, partly because, unlike Taiwan,
it has avoided sharp currency appreciation. Nonetheless, regions such as
Pusan, where traditional manufacturing industries are concentrated, have
been hit hard.
The impact of competition from the emerging economies has been partly
offset, however, by the rapid growth of regional markets, which both
countries have been quick to exploit. South-east Asia has overtaken the US
to become Korea's biggest export market. Despite Taiwan's ban on direct
transport links with China, its exports to the mainland are expected this
year to match those to the US.
But both countries are keenly aware that, to stay ahead of regional rivals,
they need to raise their performance closer to levels in the industrialised
world by shifting into activities with higher margins and value-added.
Each brings to that task contrasting competitive strengths, reflecting
distinctive industrial structures evolved over the past 30 years.
Taiwan's economy is built on the spirited entrepreneurship of swarms of
small manufacturing businesses, which account for most of its exports. Niche
producers par excellence, they have prospered in sectors ruled by fashion or
rapid technical change and have made Taiwan the world's largest exporter of
bicycles and printed circuit boards for personal computers.
If Taiwanese are east Asia's skilled artisans, Koreans are its forgemasters.
The sprawling chaebol, or family-controlled conglomerates that dominate the
Korean economy, have long sought advantage in large-scale heavy industry,
gambling ever larger investments in giant mass-production facilities.
This heroic risk-taking - long encouraged and underwritten by government
support - has made Korea the world's biggest shipbuilder and its sixth
largest producer of steel and cars. In all these sectors, further ambitious
expansion is planned.
Despite these differences, the two countries share some important
weaknesses. Both depend heavily on imported technology and components, above
all from Japan, with which they run large trade deficits. These amounted
last year to 6.5 per cent of Taiwan's gross national product and 3.5 per
cent of Korea's.
Though Korean semiconductor makers have recently gained world market share
in D-Ram memory chips, their achievement owes less to trail-blazing
technology than to continued heavy investment in production capacity at a
time when recession-bound Japanese producers were cutting back.
Most Korean and Taiwanese companies also remain 'fast followers', not
innovators, and lack strong international consumer franchises and marketing
skills. Much of Taiwan's output is still sub-contract work for foreign
companies, which distribute the products under their own names. Some Korean
groups, such as Hyundai and Samsung, are trying to establish their brands
overseas. But despite increased attention to quality, their products have
yet to overcome a nondescript image as second-best alternatives to Japanese
goods.
As a consequence, the two countries' exports still sell heavily on price,
leaving them highly sensitive to exchange rate movements. In Korea's case,
the problem is compounded by the fact that many of its exports are in
sectors where Japan is the acknowledged quality and technology leader.
Similar doubts were, of course, expressed about Japan's prospects as
recently as 15 years ago. However, there are important differences. Western
manufacturers, which once provided soft targets for Japanese exporters, have
grown tougher, as global competition has forced them to restructure, improve
quality and innovate faster.
Japan also controls access to its most sensitive industrial know-how more
strictly than did the western countries whose technology it borrowed freely
early in its development. Even though Korea's Samsung recently developed the
world's first 256MB D-Ram, it must still rely on Japanese equipment to make
the devices in volume.
Faced with these obstacles, Korean and Taiwanese businessmen no longer talk
as though emulating Japan's industrial ascendancy were just a matter of
time. They increasingly accept that their economies can aspire to match its
achievements only in selected areas.
Some Korean exporters are also placing less emphasis on the US and western
Europe, after losing market share there. They aim instead to concentrate in
the next few years on less demanding third world markets. Many are also
eyeing keenly the potential of North Korea's market, in the belief that the
two countries may soon be unified.
Longer term, the two tigers are pinning hopes to government-backed pushes in
high-technology. Both countries are stepping up spending on research and
development, investing in science parks and have ambitious plans to develop
aerospace and biotechnology industries.
Their most valuable assets are skilled labour forces and sizeable pools of
western-educated engineers and scientists, many of whom they are now seeking
to entice back home from jobs abroad. 'Engineers here are good but cost less
than in Japan, so we can afford a bigger effort,' says Mr Winston Wang, head
of Nan-Yang Plastics, one of Taiwan's largest manufacturers.
The catch, however, is that other countries can play the same game. 'China
has 20 or 30 times more engineers than Korea or Taiwan, and they are even
cheaper,' says one western businessman.
Taiwan also wants to develop its service sector and attract foreign capital
and technology by becoming a centre for the regional operations of
multinational companies. But it faces daunting handicaps. As well as its
diplomatic isolation and lack of direct links with China, Taiwan has poor
infrastructure, countless barriers to foreign investment and opaque rules of
business conduct.
Both tigers have surprised the world before by achieving apparently
impossible feats. But while their efforts in the past have been geared to
storming other countries' markets, the challenge today is increasingly to
tackle structural weaknesses in their own.
Historically, the tigers' overriding priorities have been to replace imports
with home-produced goods and promote export-led growth. They have targeted
'strategic' industries and sheltered their home markets with extensive
non-tariff barriers.
Such protection has exacted a price by encouraging excess capacity and
slowing industrial rationalisation. Korea, which imported 1,300 cars last
year, has four - possibly soon to be five - volume producers, while in
Taiwan 11 car assemblers serve only 20m people.
Financial markets, meanwhile, have been constrained by tight exchange
controls. Policies which directed credit to 'strategic' sectors on
preferential terms have turned many commercial banks into extensions of
industrial policy.
In short, policies that have helped make the two countries champion
exporters have insulated their economies from global market forces and
stunted domestic demand. Lacking strong pressure from consumers at home to
innovate and develop sophisticated marketing skills, their industries have
followed, rather than led, international market trends.
Gradually, though, the old order is starting to crumble. In both countries,
authoritarian military regimes were replaced by democratic governments in
recent years. This has loosened governments' grip on industrial policy and
encouraged lobbies to press for economic and financial reform.
The search for a bigger world role is also increasing pressures for change.
Korea's impending application for membership of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, the club for the world's leading
economies, will expose its restrictions on capital flows to critical
scrutiny. Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as
an industrialised economy this year will require it to adopt a more liberal
trade policy.
But although both governments say they are committed to liberalisation,
progress to date has proven halting and haphazard. The political drive from
on high faces formidable obstruction from bureaucrats below, who fear
deregulation will erode their power.
In Taiwan, democracy is also blamed for slowing reform efforts. 'Democracy
makes the economy more transparent and fair, but less efficient,' says Mr
Vincent Siew, chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning.
'In the days of martial law, we just did what was right for the country. It
is much harder to push through decisions now.'
Such interventionism has traditionally been even more pronounced in Korea,
where the government seems even more reluctant to accept that genuine
liberalisation would restrict its scope to intervene in the economy.
Ministers' continuing inclination to meddle is exemplified by their
strenuous behind-the-scenes efforts to prevent Samsung from starting car
production and Hyundai from competing in steel, on the grounds that they
would undermine the profitability of existing producers.
'Ministers and officials think they have to plan liberalisation in every
detail,' says Dr Jwa of the Korea Development Institute, who acts as an
adviser to the finance ministry. 'They have no clear concept of what a free
market means.'
All the evidence suggests that entrenching market-based reforms in Korea and
Taiwan will take time. Perhaps the biggest barrier of all is the
self-confidence bred by the giant economic strides they have made in the
past 30 years.
As Dr Young Soogil, an eminent Korean economist puts it: 'We think we are
changing very rapidly because we only compare ourselves to our own past.
What people don't realise is that the rest of the world is changing just as
quickly, and we are in danger of being left out.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Ulster's missing centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major's political skills probably do not extend to stage-managing the
internal politics of the loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. The
timing of their ceasefire announcement last week, on the eve of his speech
to the Conservative party conference, was therefore either a stroke of luck
for the prime minister or, possibly, a deliberate present to him from the
loyalist leadership.
The loyalists, like the mainstream Ulster Unionists but so far unlike the
Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists, have apparently decided that 'the
union is safe' in Mr Major's hands. They believe the IRA's cessation of
violence since August 31 (except as a brutal method of policing its own
urban strongholds) is an admission of defeat. They do not believe, as Mr
Paisley does and as Sinn Fein claims to, that the IRA ceased fire only
because Britain has lost interest in Northern Ireland and is looking for a
way out. Mr Major's promise of a referendum on any new arrangement has
reassured them, as it has unionist opinion generally. That pledge gives the
majority in the province a veto which was not granted to it when Mr Major's
predecessor negotiated the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.
Opposite expectations
So Northern Ireland begins this week free from the immediate fear of
terrorism, for the first time in 25 years. That is a blessed relief, for
which Mr Major certainly deserves his share of credit, along with his Irish
opposite number, Albert Reynolds, and the leader of the main nationalist
party in Northern Ireland, John Hume.
But to call this ceasefire 'peace' would be premature because it is based on
opposite expectations. Loyalists believe the United Kingdom is safe;
republicans that they are on the way to a united Ireland. At least one of
those expectations is going to be disappointed; the British and Irish
governments may even, as they try to square the circle, convince both sides
that they have been betrayed.
That is the fear. The hope must be that peace will find its own momentum;
that on neither side will paramilitary leaders wish to incur the odium of
breaking it. That depends in part on those leaders themselves gaining
psychological benefits from being seen as 'men of peace' rather than 'men of
violence'. The effort to include them in negotiations is therefore
justified. But no one should lose sight of the fact that in electoral terms
these are fringe parties. They may have the ability to wreck a settlement.
They do not have a mandate to negotiate one.
Crucial breakthrough
Much has been made of the parallels between the 'peace process' in Northern
Ireland and those in South Africa and the Middle East. In so far as such
parallels have any value, they suggest that the crucial breakthrough must be
achieved by establishing a new relationship of trust and mutual
understanding between the leaders of mainstream, representative parties in
two hitherto bitterly polarised communities. That was achieved in South
Africa between F W de Klerk and Nelson Mandela: the relationship reached a
point where their respective communities' confidence in them depended on
their ability to continue co-operating with each other and to demonstrate
progress, and both understood that. Between Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin
the same is objectively true, but the process is in difficulties because
neither seems to be confident that the other has understood it.
Between John Hume and James Molyneaux, who would be the analogous figures in
Northern Ireland, the process has not really started. The job of creating
such a relationship has been left to the British and Irish prime ministers.
The latter certainly need to be involved, because nationalists in Northern
Ireland would not have confidence in a purely internal settlement. But in
the last resort trust has to be built between the two communities, and the
leaders of the mainstream, representative political parties on both sides
have a crucial part to play.
Up to now Mr Hume has devoted his main energies to building an alliance of
nationalist parties committed to constitutional methods; and Mr Molyneaux
has been mainly concerned to keep the British government committed to
maintaining the union. Both have succeeded, and deserve credit for their
success. Now they need to concentrate on finding common ground with each
other.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Snail's pace at Japan's MoF
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been clear for more than two decades that the rigid
compartmentalisation of the Japanese banking system is based on functional
divisions that no longer correspond with market reality. Yet the
deregulation of the system has been a peculiarly tortured exercise in
gradualism, as last week's events demonstrated once again.
The decision by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to sanction the plans of five
city banks to set up securities subsidiaries is an important step. Yet it
amounts to no more than a partial retreat from the restrictions of Article
65 of the Japanese Securities and Exchange Act - the equivalent of the US
Glass-Steagall Act, which prevents banks from conducting securities
business. While the city banks will now be permitted to underwrite corporate
bond issues, their desire to compete in the wider securities area has been
frustrated by the lobbying of the securities firms, whose profits have
suffered in the aftermath of the bubble economy, and by the conservatism of
the MoF's own officials.
That is not to say that limited concessions are worthless. In a world where
corporations increasingly cut out the banking middleman and go direct to the
markets for funds, an entree into the bond markets will be welcome to the
city banks, just as it has already been welcomed by the long-term credit
banks. But if regulation is to be aligned with market logic in bonds, why
not in equities too?
Motor for change
Of the main forces for financial deregulation in Japan, bad debts are
proving a far more potent motor for change than external pressure from the
US and elsewhere. Last week, no doubt with a nudge from the MoF, Mitsubishi
Bank paid Y200bn (Pounds 1.3bn) for a controlling stake in Nippon Trust, the
troubled trust bank that is expected to record the first post-tax loss in
Japanese banking history in its current financial year. Mitsubishi has, in
compensation, been granted a mandate to explore all those trust bank
activities which another recent set of semi-liberalising measures from the
MoF has kept off-limits for the city banks as a group. In particular,
Mitsubishi will have access to potentially lucrative pension fund management
business, which will be a source of envy to its peers.
There are plenty of precedents for such a regulatory trade-off. In the US in
the 1980s inter-state regulatory boundaries and functional dividing lines
between banks and savings and loans were dropped on an ad hoc basis to
divert the cost of socialising bank losses away from the federal budget. And
in Japan last year Daiwa Bank was given carte blanche to conduct the full
range of securities activities in exchange for rescuing the medium-sized
broking firm Cosmo Securities.
Deficiency of assets
If there is a difference in the approach on either side of the Pacific, it
is simply that the scale of the down payments on a regulatory exeat in Japan
looks exceptionally large. For Mitsubishi Bank Y200bn is not enough to make
a significant dent in its capital ratios, but it is still a high price to
pay for a trust bank that has a sizeable deficiency of assets against
liabilities.
Also striking is that liberalisation has not, in Japan, been synonymous with
profit. Those foreigners who obtained seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange just
in time for the collapse of the Japanese stock market know that the
experience can be as expensive as it is liberating. And despite the enormous
freedom that Daiwa Bank now enjoys across the financial services markets, it
has yet to translate it into a notably superior performance.
Given the extent of the bad debt problem in Japanese banking, there will
probably be further cases where the MoF is prepared to drop its regulatory
guard in the interests of stabilising the system more cheaply. Yet the
overall pace of deregulation looks set to remain turgid. That will be a
profound relief to the less efficient players in the system. The same
applies to bankers in more flexibly regulated financial centres in other
countries, since a disproportionate amount of Japanese financial business
will continue to be diverted off-shore. It is a remarkable feature of this
otherwise profoundly competitive nation that it should offer such generosity
to its rivals in an important area of international trade.

The rich are not like you and me - especially when they live in Switzerland.
Nearly half of the country's 50 richest residents are not Swiss nationals,
according to the latest rankings in Swiss business magazine Bilanz. Among
the 25 Swiss franc multi-billionaires, all but seven are foreign, including
Otto Beisheim of the German Metro retail group, Octav Botnar, the fugitive
British car dealer, and Johann Rupert, of the Rothmans tobacco and Vendome
luxury goods businesses.
Notably absent from this year's list, however, are the Brenninkmeijers
behind the C&amp;A clothing store chain. The reclusive family complained last
year that, while its wealth might be considerable, and many members of the
clan might live in Switzerland, no single family member possessed a
particularly large chunk of the fortune. Bilanz still believes that the
Brenninkmeijers are wealthier than the officially designated number ones,
Vera Oeri-Hoffmann and Lukas Hoffmann, inheritors of the Hoffmann-La Roche
drugs group, who weigh in at some SFr10bn each.

Having endured months watching vast quantities of red ink haemorrhaging from
the state-run French bank, staff at Credit Lyonnais apparently reckon the
worst is now over. That, at least is the promising-sounding finding of an
internal opinion poll, assiduously leaked to a number of French newspapers
last week. But then, just how believable is a survey in which it also
emerges that 89 per cent of staff purport to be 'very' or 'fairly' satisfied
with the level of interest in their jobs?

Absent from the massed military forces guarding the return of Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince over the weekend were the fifty
soldiers President Lech Walesa so readily promised Bill Clinton last month.
But not for want of trying.
The first hurdle was a reluctant domestic cabinet, miffed at Walesa's
freelance activities, and initially unwilling to produce funds for tropical
uniforms and medical jabs. But the defence ministry has finally stumped up
and the troops are kitted out and awaiting an American aircraft. Only
trouble is, they have now mustered so much equipment that a single machine
may be insufficient. The US State Department counters that it is 'between
financial years' and hence not in a position to fund additional transport.
Oh, the trials of a country on the long march to NATO membership.

Calling all those with next June's G7 summit pencilled in to the diary. Book
now to avoid disappointment.
The powers-that-be have just twigged that the picturesque but sleepy city of
Halifax, Nova Scotia (population 300,000) cannot possibly accommodate those
thousands of officials, journalists and assorted hangers-on who grace these
lavish jamborees.
Having jettisoned the notion of using vacationing students' empty digs to
house the overflow, members of the Canadian organising committee are now
hastily calling up the big cruise lines. Any chance of piloting a luxury
vessel or two from the Med or the Caribbean up into Halifax's - notoriously
polluted - harbour?
Well, not much, actually. The reaction to date has been remarkably cool.
Either the budget even for a G7 jolly will not stretch - or else the cruise
operators can think of better ways to market themselves than filling their
cabins with squabbling bureaucrats.

The Millennium Commission has made a decision. The body entrusted with
dispensing Pounds 1.6bn to mark the new era may be lamentably ill-equipped
to explain how it plans to spot things millennialistic. What it can say is
that the man picked less than two months ago as its chief executive -
Nicholas Hinton from Save the Children Fund - is unsuitable for the job. And
he was only meant to start today.
One can imagine what happened. The nine commissioners, a geographically
representative but not especially eminent band of worthies, have been
travelling the country together soliciting ideas - and bolstering their own
sense of importance as the vastness of their financial power sinks in. Along
comes Hinton, a man accustomed to throwing his weight around after nearly a
decade building Save the Children. He threatens to have an opinion or two,
so is sent packing as summarily as an unsuccessful supplicant for an Arts
Council grant.
Back to the drawing board, then, with the advertisement for a boss who,
first time around, was supposed to possess 'presence, authority and
ingenuity'. Obviously a misprint for a kow-towing wallflower masquerading as
a yes-man.
Meanwhile, the commissioners might care to consider that, while they
understandably wish to wallow in the glory of picking the dozen or so really
big projects, the bulk of the funds is destined for a multiplicity of rather
less glamorous, but in the end much more significant, endeavours. When it is
time to choose those, that may be the moment when the bigwigs regret letting
Hinton go.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The modern face of an ancient city: Central Beirut has been
razed in order to revive it as a financial capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a gaping hole where Beirut's heart used to be. Gone are the ancient
markets, art deco cinemas, coffee shops and bordellos that made the Lebanese
capital the Middle East's most glamorous playground and vibrant financial
centre.
The remnants of the city's heyday remained until two months ago. But in
recent weeks 150 buildings have been demolished, with another 150 due to
follow.
From the city's ring road there is now a view of the Mediterranean over a
wasteground of tarmac: 1.8m sq m of city-centre land that is to be the site
of Beirut's revival.
Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn property company set up through a flotation
earlier this year, has begun its task. It is rebuilding central Beirut.
For 10 years, Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, has cherished a
scheme to recreate Beirut as the financial capital of a newly peaceful
Middle East. Solidere is his creation, and with a 7 per cent stake in the
company, he is its largest declared shareholder.
Solidere will now oversee the building of offices for the multinationals,
banks and companies that Mr Hariri believes are keen to re-enter a region
opening its borders and economies. Hotels will go up for the tourists, who
he hopes will now return to the region. The Lebanese people's traditional
talents for trade and brokerage will be harnessed. And an economy based on
financial services, traditionally worth some 70 per cent of Lebanon's GDP,
will be revived.
But even as Solidere is demolishing central Beirut, Mr Hariri's motives in
launching the project, its substance, and its wisdom, are all being
questioned.
Many Lebanese are deeply suspicious that Mr Hariri, a man who made a
multi-billion dollar fortune as a contractor in Saudi Arabia, should have
created a big contracting company to redevelop the centre of Beirut.
Some of the landowners in central Beirut, who were forced to exchange their
land for shares in Solidere say their property was heavily undervalued at
about Dollars 1,500 per square metre. Land prices on the fringe of
Solidere's allocated land are already at Dollars 3,000 per square metre, and
rising, they say.
'Hariri is going to make lots of money from the downtown project,' says Mr
Adnan Iskander, a political scientist at the American University of Beirut.
'This is not all just for the public interest.'
Mr Hariri maintains, however, that the prime minister's Solidere shares are
held in trust and all profits will go to his charitable foundation, which
has paid for the education of thousands of Lebanese in recent years.
Whether or not Mr Hariri stands to gain personally from the redevelopment,
many are questioning the need to raze so much of the city in order to revive
it.
Mr Assem Salaam, an architect in Beirut for more than 30 years and one of
the hard core of vocal opponents, believes Solidere has destroyed the
'social tissue' of downtown Beirut.
'Central Beirut had tradition and a memory. It played a role in being a
meeting point of Lebanon's various communities. It played a role in the
fusion of social classes. It had an enormous richness,' he says.
He believes that no more than 20 buildings in the city centre were truly
beyond redemption and can see no justification for the scale of Solidere's
redevelopment.
Landowners should have been allowed to create smaller property companies to
redevelop the city centre organically from its ruins, he says. 'You are not
developing from scratch an Abu Dhabi or a Jeddah or a Riyadh,' he says
alluding to Mr Hariri's background as a Gulf contractor. 'You are touching a
medieval, Mediterranean city.'
Solidere has adapted its plans in response to these criticisms, says Mr
Nasser Chammaa, Solidere's chairman. The number of old buildings to be
retained and restored has been increased to 266 from just over a hundred to
begin with - and the company is canvassing architectural opinions on ways of
recreating some of the old souqs.
'All of a sudden a portion of our memory has disappeared,' he acknowledges.
'For the public it's slightly difficult - but that will have to continue.'
Mr Hariri and his staff at Solidere believe that only through ambitious,
comprehensive redevelopment can Lebanon succeed. They liken Beirut's
rebuilding to west Germany's reconstruction after the second world war - an
unmissable opportunity to build an expanded and modernised infrastructure
virtually from scratch.
Mr Hariri is seeking to create the kind of momentum necessary to bring back
the skilled, Lebanese middle-class that fled the 15-year civil war  - and
revive the flows of private Gulf Arab wealth to the city. Both ingredients
require confidence. Like Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, the project is
an investment designed to generate confidence. It is that confidence that
will then lead to the city's revival.
But in selling the new Beirut, even senior members of Lebanon's government
differ over quite what a revived Beirut's economic role would be.
Some, such as Mr Hariri, believe that Lebanon has a future as a regional
financial hub, despite competition from Israel, which, with an economy 10
times larger, has its eyes set on the same target. Gulf Arabs would much
rather invest in Lebanon, they argue, and Syria intends to use Beirut as a
catalyst for its own gradual economic opening.
Others, including Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, see Lebanon's
future as in complementary development with Israel. 'We have different
vocations,' he says. 'Israel is a predominantly industrial, high-tech
country, but we will address the role of an intermediary. It is like the
relation between, for instance, Japan and Singapore in the Far East.'
There are also political uncertainties over the scheme. Mr Hariri and his
hand-picked team at Solidere are identified with the project to such a
degree that many doubt whether the country's rehabilitation could survive
his departure - in a land where the tenure of political leaders has been as
precarious as anywhere in the world. Similar fears revolve around the future
of Syria. Mr Hariri recently called Syrian President Hafez al-Assad the
'unknown soldier' of the reconstruction project. Few believe Lebanon, and
its economy, could survive a turbulent succession in Damascus unscathed.
Neither Mr Hariri nor Solidere can afford to be troubled by such concerns.
Instead, they are hurrying to complete the basic infrastructure within the
next two and a half years. 'We will have the critical mass of central Beirut
in place in five to seven years,' says Mr Salame.
It will be a long time before anyone can tell whether Beirut can revive
itself as a financial capital and become 'the ancient city of the future' of
Solidere's slogan.
There are some hopeful indicators. In the last two years, Gulf Arabs are
believed to have pumped Dollars 1bn into the city's real estate market and
some 40,000 Lebanese expatriates have returned. Buying by Gulf Arabs has
also pushed Solidere's share price from its issue price in June of Dollars
100 to nearly Dollars 170.
The only certainty for the next couple of years is that Beirut is becoming
the biggest building site in the Middle East, but Mr Hariri's supporters
argue that there is no better alternative. 'None of our critics have come up
with a project for rebuilding the centre which is different from ours,' says
Mr Chammaa.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right to livelihood, not 'pristine
poverty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK MCCULLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The World Bank's Tim Cullen ('Sleepless and irritable in suburbia',
October 10) mocks the position of those who seek to halt the World Bank's
support of socially and environmentally destructive projects, in particular
large dams. 'This group', claims Cullen, 'would like the bank to steer clear
of any activities that challenge the right of people to live in pristine
poverty. . .'. Presumably Cullen counts among the members of 'this group'
International Rivers Network - author of the recently released Manibeli
Declaration. This calls for a moratorium on World Bank-funding of large dams
pending a comprehensive review of the costs and benefits of its past dam
projects - and the more than 2,000 organisations from 44 countries who have
endorsed the declaration.
Cullen arrogantly dismisses the misery caused by the Bank's large dam
programme, saying merely that people 'may have to be resettled'. In reality,
about 10m people have been directly displaced by World Bank-supported dams
over the past 50 years. More enlightened employees of the Bank admit that
dam displacement takes part on a massive scale and tears apart poor, but
often self-sufficient, communities, robbing them of their land and jobs, and
increasing rates of malnourishment, sickness and death.
At stake is not people's right to live in 'pristine poverty', but their
right not to have their cultures, self-respect and livelihoods destroyed.
Large infrastructure projects, says Cullen, merely 'have the potential to
cause environmental damage': in the real world, Bank-funded dams have
destroyed hundreds of rivers, wiped out riverine and coastal fisheries, and
drowned huge areas of fertile farmland and diverse forests.
If the World Bank were, as Cullen claims, really concerned about the
well-being of the billions of people without access to electricity or clean
water, it would not be promoting uneconomic and technically flawed dam
projects which have in most cases failed to support rural water supply or
electrification programmes. The World Bank's own 'self-critical reports'
which Cullen boasts of (and which the Bank invariably ignores) show that its
large irrigation projects have been stunningly inefficient, and have had
serious environmental side effects. A 1991 World Bank study revealed that in
almost half of the irrigation projects surveyed, crop production had
actually fallen after project construction.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not economic sophistry, but
verifiable reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Stephen Beer (Letters, October 8) perpetuates a common misconception
about the supposed impracticality of 'simple economic theory' by confusing
two aspects of market behaviour. All market actors who seek returns want to
be correct in their forecasts, not just those concerned for their political
reputations.
Such motivations are not only no guarantee of good judgment (witness former
chancellor Norman Lamont's hapless performance on Black Wednesday), but are
in fact irrelevant in considering markets' real utility as the best
available collectors, processors, and disseminators of information.
Mr Beer's 'casual observation' that 'most market participants can be wrong
some of the time' in fact demonstrates this virtue.
No single person or group will likely be right about the future, or even
about very much of the present. However, in generating prices out of
countless individual calculations, markets co-ordinate the limited bits of
information that participants actually do have - and far more regularly and
capably than any central institution.
This is not sophistry, but historically verifiable reality.
Yes, financial markets are full of small traders who blindly follow trends,
which may themselves be based on unreasonable or unfounded expectations.
Yes, they are prone to panics and the occasional disproportionate influence
of a George Soros, and sometimes require correction. They are indeed
imperfect and an inappropriate object of anyone's 'faith'.
Nonetheless, their collective best guesses about future developments such as
inflation are based on far more information than could ever fit into a brief
on Bank of England governor Eddie George's desk.
Distortions in markets are exceptional by definition, and they correct
themselves as new or hitherto under-appreciated information comes to light.
In central banks however, under the guise of 'correction', distortion is the
name of the game.
Casual observation suggests to me that such intervention is very rarely
successful or beneficial - an odd foundation for such important and
expensive institutions.
Practical experience has exposed the folly of attempting to direct goods and
services centrally.
Why are we still willing to countenance similar discretionary power
regarding bonds and currencies?
