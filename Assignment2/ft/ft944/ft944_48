FT  15 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Tories down but not out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the House of Commons returns on Monday, it will conduct its debates
against a changed political backdrop. The government is on the defensive.
The balance of forces on the opposition benches has shifted in favour of a
Labour party revitalised by Mr Tony Blair. The Labour leader's speech at his
party's conference in Blackpool last week touched the concerns of many
ordinary voters. It remains to be seen whether he can sustain the momentum.
How to react to the Blair challenge has been the subject of much debate at
the Conservative conference in Bournemouth this week. Some have suggested
that the party establish 'clear blue water' between itself and Labour - a
phrase suggesting the espousal of greater Euroscepticism, rightwing social
policies and early cuts in taxation. In a characteristically low-key speech
yesterday Mr John Major wisely resisted the temptation to shift to the
right. Labour's pilfering of Conservative principles is a form of flattery,
the prime minister argued. Labour admits it was previously wrong on almost
every important issue. Why should the electorate believe it is right now?
Quite reasonably, Mr Major noted that 'the language of politics is now
Conservative language'. The Tories were the real thing, the opposition an
unconvincing imitation. 'We are the party of savings, of ownership, of
property, of personal independence,' he said, before outlining a programme
of consolidation, of resting on laurels perceived by the cabinet but not by
the populace.
Some of these achievements are genuine. The government was knocked off its
perch on Black Wednesday, but it deserves credit for subsequently setting
out to establish a track record of non-inflationary growth. The effort,
however, will remain fragile as the next election approaches. And it is, to
say the least, doubtful whether it can be maintained for the next quarter
century during which the prime minister forecast a doubling of living
standards.
Fine aspirations
He defended other key areas of his administration's record, with varying
degrees of credibility. The Tories' fine aspirations for education have not
so far been realised; Mrs Gillian Shephard, the new minister, will have to
try harder than her predecessors if she is to persuade the teaching
profession to embrace the national curriculum, testing and league tables. Mr
Major's long-term proposals to offer nursery education for four-year-olds
may go some way towards countering Labour's more ambitious schemes.
The prime minister put up a passionate defence of his government's
stewardship of the health service, but the Conservatives can never win
political advantage on the NHS. Whatever Mr Major says, some people will
continue to believe that the creation of an internal market is a prelude to
privatisation. On law and order, the government's recent record is
lamentable, and Mr Michael Howard is not a home secretary to win the
confidence of a disquieted electorate. Mr Major came close to Mr Blair's
celebrated 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime'. Flattery runs
both ways.
Clear-cut difference
The prime minister did underline the clear-cut difference between the
parties on constitutional reform and the future shape of the United Kingdom.
The Conservatives would grant self-determination to Ulster alone; Labour
offers regional assemblies in Scotland and Wales. It is a distinction that
will loom large in the next election if Mr Major has his way.
On the evolution of the EU, he stands by his Gaullist strategy, agreed after
protracted consultation with his divided ministerial colleagues. The
resulting coalition is less Eurosceptical than party activists would like,
and could easily come under strain in the run-up to the 1996
inter-governmental conference. But for the moment it holds, despite uneasy
rumblings from all sides.
What was audibly lacking in the speech was any promise of further
free-market initiatives. On Post Office privatisation, for example, a
subject still being debated among ministers, Mr Major was eloquently silent.
The government may eventually regret shying away from partial privatisation,
a plan with sounder economic foundations than Labour's ideas.
Yet this was a visibly more confident Mr Major, delivering a competent
speech at the end of what might have been a disquieting conference. The Tory
leadership has shored up morale among party workers, without resorting to
the distasteful xenophobia that marred last year's proceedings.
If the government is to recover sufficient ground to stand a chance at the
next general election, it must now reach out in similar vein to the
electorate at large. It may be that the message of safety first is not
enough after what will have been 17 or 18 years in office, and that not even
the sustained economic recovery that Mr Major is counting on will dissuade
the voters from their desire for a change. On yesterday's showing, however,
the Tories must be counted as down, far down - but not yet out.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Gospel according to the chancellor: The biggest question for
voters in tomorrow's German election is whether to kick Kohl out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than anything else, it has been Helmut Kohl's election in Germany.
He has dominated the campaign from start to finish with his extraordinary
energy and his tireless electioneering, careering by helicopter or motorcade
from meeting to meeting. His booming, nasal voice - cracking with strain
over the past 10 days - has preached the gospel according to the chancellor
to more than 1m voters.
Like a tank that cannot turn, he has ploughed straight on, regardless of
demonstrators and downpours, of bad news or good arguments. Fuelled by his
apparently unquenchable optimism, and his enormous belief in himself, he has
dragged his own popularity, and that of his ruling Christian Democratic
Union, to the front of the field. He has driven himself, according to his
closest advisers, to the very limit of his immense physical resources.
But it is more than that. For Helmut Kohl has not just been the preacher. He
has been the issue. The real question for German electors has been the same
since this marathon election campaign took off in March: do you want to keep
the chancellor, or do you want to kick him out?
His bulky shadow has loomed over every one of the 20 polls, from local
government elections, through state parliaments, the election of the federal
president, the European parliament, and now, at last, the general election
tomorrow.
Whatever burning issues the opposition Social Democrats and their earnest
leader Rudolf Scharping have sought to raise - soaring taxation, the plight
of the homeless and unemployed, the unequal burden of unification, nuclear
energy, the environment, the drift and incompetence of the Kohl
administration - the question has come back to the personality of the man in
charge.
For Mr Kohl and his campaign strategists, it was a huge gamble. He is quite
as much despised in his homeland as he is admired. His personal popularity
has never been high. He has always before been elected in spite of himself,
not because of himself.
But this time, the strategists argued, it had to be different. After 12
years in power, the ruling coalition might lose on issues alone. Only the
chancellor could turn the tide.
Against all the odds, it looks - with one day still to go - as if he may
have done it. If he has, it will not be in spite of what he is, but because
of it.
Chancellor Kohl is a man of extraordinary contradictions, for all his veneer
of earthy directness.
He is both incurably provincial, and an international statesman; he is
quintessentially German, and yet a passionate European. He is thick-skinned,
patient and placid, but sometimes often hyper-sensitive to criticism,
truculent and aggressive.
His jovial exterior hides a ruthlessness towards his rivals. He is both a
faithful friend, and an implacable enemy. He inspires loyalty and despair in
his staff in equal measures.
He can be embarrassingly emotional, and yet coldly calculating; a thoughtful
strategist, yet an incoherent speaker. While his government has been
remarkable for its sense of drift, he has exercised a dominant leadership
from the top. He represents the establishment, and yet he manages to present
himself as anti-establishment, the man of the people.
It is the contradictions that make the man, and drive him on.
Four years ago, re-elected with a record majority on the wave of euphoria
which followed unification, he could have relaxed. 'He knows he has his name
in the history books,' a close confidant said at the time. 'He can afford to
sit back and bask in the glory.'
Today, aged only 64, he has been leader of his party for 21 years, and
German chancellor for the past 12. He has become the dominant figure on the
international stage. He has seen German unification become a reality. He
appears to have done it all.
And yet he has thrown himself into this latest election campaign, for a
fourth full term in office with an energy and enthusiasm that even his own
closest advisers have never seen before.
'I believe he needs to prove to himself, and to the world at large, that the
Germans believe in him, and trust him, as the chancellor of German
unification,' is how one close observer sums it up. 'He sees it as a
plebiscite on his role as the unity chancellor.'
Mr Kohl also enjoys having power, and exercising it. He has never made any
secret of his boyhood ambition to be chancellor, and the single-mindedness
with which he drove towards that goal, in spite of three early rejections in
his efforts - twice by his party, and once at the polls.
In the past four years, however, the achievement and consolidation of German
unification, bound inextricably to his vision of European union, has become
his main driving force.
On the one hand, he is still passionately committed to his European goal. He
does not, by all accounts, entirely trust his potential successors to be as
determined in making the European union irreversible. He wants another big
step towards integration from the European Union Inter-Governmental
Conference scheduled for 1996.
On the other, he is determined to disprove his critics over German
unification.
It was in Halle, in the heartland of east Germany's devastated chemical
industry, that he was hit by an egg at a demonstration back in 1991. He lost
his temper, and went for the culprit in the crowd. It has never been
forgotten. He was mocked for his words, when he said the east would be
transformed into a 'blooming landscape'. The reality was mass unemployment
and bitterness. The German press said he would never be able to face an east
German crowd again.
In this election, he has deliberately returned to every single town and
village in the east where he went in 1990, promising that vision of a
'blooming landscape'. He has faced the crowds - not so many, to be sure, but
still numbering in thousands, not hundreds - and he has admitted his
mistakes. 'I was wrong,' he says, 'but only in the time it would take. I am
still convinced that you will have a blooming landscape.'
The result has been a significant recovery in the standing of his CDU in the
east, almost entirely attributable to the efforts of the chancellor.
Mr Kohl is also driven by a deep bitterness towards the reformed Communist
party, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). He accuses its members of
being the heirs of those who destroyed the Weimar republic, Germany's first
attempt at democracy, and paved the way directly for the advent of Adolf
Hitler. He calls them 'red-painted fascists'.
'He seems to feel very deeply about the ingratitude of east German electors
who, in spite of having won their freedom, still turn round and vote
communist,' says Mr Dieter Wonka, political correspondent of the Leipziger
Volkszeitung. 'He takes it very personally.'
It is in part a counter-productive ploy, which has allowed the PDS to
exploit its identity as the one 'home-grown' east German party. The more the
westerners attack it, the more voters it seems to pack in.
But Mr Kohl does not seem to care. He is concerned not so much to woo his
opponents - 'the 60 per cent who won't vote for me anyway' - as to ensure
the loyalty of his natural constituency.
He is a party man to his toes: a provincial politician who came up the hard
way, cultivating the grass roots and building his base, until he reached the
top. He despises colleagues who fail to do the same.
His greatest enemies have been made not in the opposition, but in the ranks
of his own CDU. He has banished potential competitors, such as Professor
Kurt Biedenkopf, the intellectual former general-secretary who now rules
Saxony, in east Germany, as a second-best to the federal republic; Mr Heiner
Geissler, one of the most brilliant advocates on the left of the party and
another former general-secretary was abruptly removed by his boss.
One reason is Mr Kohl's political ruthlessness. 'Don't be deceived by the
joviality,' says a friend. 'This is an iron chancellor inside.' He is also
deeply suspicious of all things intellectual, reinforced by the obvious
contempt that many intellectuals have for the sometimes inarticulate and
clumsy chancellor.
In revenge, he cultivates his image as a provincial, the man from the
Palatinate. 'Something which is frequently underestimated is his way of
putting himself on the other side,' says an admirer. 'He manages to persuade
ordinary people that 'it is me and you against the establishment'.'
'He has that in common with President Bill Clinton. He has always had a very
critical relationship with the bureaucracy, and with the middle-ranking
officials in the party. He is like a general who pushes the officers to one
side, and appeals directly to the troops.'
His provincialism is also a factor in his passionate belief in European
integration, something that he has not diluted, either in the drive for
German unification, or in the face of post-Maastricht Euro-scepticism.
'He is a man with few principles, but they are very clear,' as a close
adviser says. In every speech he repeats his conviction that 'German
unification and European union are two sides of the same coin.'
His homeland of the Palatinate is an area of Germany that has been
repeatedly devastated by Europe's wars and invasions - in the 30 years' war,
in invasions by Louis XIV and Napoleon, and in the second world war. It is a
history of which he is acutely conscious, complemented by his own personal
upbringing.
In private, he tells a story about his own family to prove the point. His
mother's brother was called Walter, who died as a soldier in the first world
war.
His own brother was called Walter, and he died in the second world war. When
his eldest son was born, Chancellor Kohl told his mother he wanted to call
the boy Walter.
'She begged me not to,' he says. 'She said the name had always been unlucky
for us.' But he insisted. He said that it was a commitment, a promise from
his generation that they would never let it happen again. His eldest son is
called Walter.
It is an emotional commitment to the European dream which he found, to his
profound disappointment, was not shared - or even understood - by Lady
Thatcher. Now Mr Kohl has outlasted Lady Thatcher and, if he wins another
term, looks set to outlast Mr Mitterrand. How long will he stay?
He says he will not be a candidate again, after 1998, if he wins the
election tomorrow. But nobody entirely believes him. As the Frankfurter
Allgemeine newspaper pointed out, he said he would not stand 'after 1998' -
not in 1998, when the next election takes place.
It was another bit of vintage Kohl, another piece of the ultimate
politician, whose rule has ever been: Keep them guessing till the bitter
end.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Champion of the black stuff - Richard Budge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I'm as fit as a flea' is the response people usually get when they ask
Richard Budge how he is.
It is supposed to make them smile. The image could hardly be less
appropriate for this burly man, with the big voice and the hard hat.
But Budge could have taught fleas a thing or two about leaping this week.
Selected by the government as the preferred bidder for the bulk of British
Coal's assets, he is about to become Britain's biggest coalminer once
privatisation goes through. His company, RJB Mining, is front-runner to buy
almost all the remaining coalmines in England and north Wales and contracts
to supply 29m tonnes of coal to the electricity generators.
The decision by Michael Heseltine, trade secretary, to award such a large
chunk of the business to one company was both surprising and controversial.
He ignored advice that he might be creating a new coal monopoly, and he left
worthy bidders such as the Union of Democratic Mineworkers muttering
bitterly about ingratitude.
But Budge finds it neither surprising nor controversial. For nearly two
years, since British Coal was hacked into shape for privatisation, he has
been planning in his Nottinghamshire headquarters to buy as much of the
state-owned company as he could. He bid for more of it than anyone else, and
he bid a much higher price. Unlike coal's many doubters, he saw a future for
the black stuff.
Budge, 47, has always made a point of thinking independently, and thinking
big. He is also a man for risks: at an earlier stage in his life he was an
amateur racing driver, a pastime which he says 'is good for your mental
attitude', though he admits that these days he prefers fly fishing for
relaxation.
He cut his business teeth in his brother Tony's construction company, AF
Budge, which he led into opencast mining as an extension of its earth-moving
operations 20 years ago. The early years were as a contractor for British
Coal. In 1982, when the rules on coalmining were relaxed, AF Budge went into
the business direct as a licensed operator, and in 1990 bought its first
underground mine.
By then AF Budge was suffering from the recession and some ill-advised
diversification ventures into armoured cars and horses. But the company's
pressing need for cash opened the way for Richard to mount a management
buy-out of the profitable coal operations and set up on his own in 1992. A
year later, he floated RJB Mining on the stock exchange with a value of
Pounds 100m. His 10 per cent share transformed him overnight into a
multimillionaire on a salary of Pounds 225,000.
At flotation, RJB Mining was already one of the largest private mining
operations in the UK, with 11 opencast mines and a turnover of some Pounds
60m. It had got there through Budge's policy of running a highly efficient,
cost-controlled business which undercut the hugely overmanned operations of
British Coal. ('I've worked with them for 20 years. I know them inside
out.') He imported giant 170 ton Caterpillar dump trucks - the largest
operating in the UK - and made full use of new technology and mining
practices developed in countries with larger mining sectors than the UK.
Budge could not compete head on with British Coal, because its monopoly was
protected by a law that limited private operators to 150 miners per pit. But
this sharpened the incentive to drive up the productivity of the workforce
and take advantage of the artificially high price at which coal was traded
in the UK to subsidise British Coal.
As an example, Budge cites the Blenkinsopp colliery in Cumbria which he
bought in 1990. At the time, the colliery was producing 50,000 tonnes a
year. Within a year, Budge had raised this to 85,000 tonnes, and this year
expects it to produce 300,000 tonnes. Over the same period the workforce
increased from 75 to just under 100.
One reason for this growth is that Budge has never allowed the trade unions
to fix their iron grip on his business. He recognises both the National
Union of Mineworkers and the breakaway UDM, but also the right not to belong
to a union. There is no collective bargaining or productivity bonuses, and
all miners are on individual contracts.
However, the impressive productivity performance has earned Budge a
reputation as a tough, even ruthless operator along the lines of the
Victorian industrial barons. 'If they say that, I'm honoured,' he said
yesterday. 'But I hope that they add that I'm fair. You have to have
leadership, but I'm also a team player. This is a teamwork business.' All
his 2,000 employees will be sent a letter from him thanking them for helping
the company achieve this week's success.
The question now is whether he can make it all work. His bid of Pounds 900m
is many times the value of his company, even after the 40 per cent rise in
its shares since flotation. He will be able to raise more money from
shareholders, but he will also have to turn to the banks for a large chunk
of the money, leaving him highly geared.
Unsuccessful bidders say that Budge overbid for British Coal, implying that
his financial judgment may be flawed. But he has one of the top City
investment banks, BZW, part of the Barclays group, advising him. His plans
survived vetting for the government by merchant bankers at NM Rothschild.
He will also have to find a market for his output at a time when coal seems
to be going out of fashion in power generation. The growth of gas-fired
plant and environmental pressures on coal all contributed to the decline of
British Coal, which in its last year of existence will produce about 50m
tonnes, a quarter of the level in its heyday. If the acquisition goes
through, Budge will be producing between 42m and 45m tonnes a year with a
workforce of about 9,000 people.
Budge believes the decline has been overdone. British Coal has cut back too
much and pushed its production below the likely level of demand for the rest
of the decade, opening a gap for new suppliers and imports. 'They got the
business into an undersupply,' he says. 'The electricity generators are
going to need at least 45m a year up to the end of this century, possibly
52m. There's a lot to go for.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Black diamond prize for director behind coal buy-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It looked like any other pile of coal to the uninitiated but Mr Brian
Riddleston, British Coal's opencast director in Wales, thought differently.
'They are black diamonds,' he said, explaining that they were a naturally
smokeless coal which, in the UK, is only found in Wales. 'This is what
everyone wants to get their hands on at privatisation.'
How right he has been proved in the year since he made his comments to
visitors. The south Wales region of British Coal attracted more bidders  -
eight - than any of the other four on offer. That makes Mr Riddleston's
achievement in winning the government's backing as preferred bidder all the
more notable.
Assuming final negotiations are successful, Celtic Energy, the management
buy-out company he has formed along with other executives, will have fended
off competition from consortia including Mitsubishi, the Japanese
conglomerate, Powell Duffryn, the engineering company, and RJB Mining, the
coal company which is taking over all of British Coal's English mines.
Neither Mr Riddleston nor the government will say how much Celtic bid but NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government, said it was the
highest tender received. Other companies are thought to have offered at
least Pounds 85m.
The prize for Celtic is a region that produces some of the highest-quality
coal in the UK and a contract to sell 1m tonnes a year to National Power,
the electricity generator, until 1998.
The eventual success of the bid will turn on how successful Celtic is in
securing contracts after that. The opportunity for securing long-term
contracts has been demonstrated recently by National Power signing a 10-year
deal with Ryan Group, another south Wales coal company, to buy 1.5m tonnes a
year.
That deal was conditional on Ryan winning the south Wales bid. Celtic will
not necessarily be able to pick up a similar contract, however.
Ryan itself is stepping up production from its existing drift pits. There
will also be competition from an employee buy-out team which is negotiating
with the government to take over the Tower pit, the last deep mine in South
Wales, closed earlier this year.
Mr Riddleston will give no details of the contracts or the size of market he
expects in Wales. But he has no doubts about making a success. 'This is a
very well-researched bid,' he says.
Mr Riddleston, 46, has worked for 24 years for British Coal, which he joined
as a trainee after graduating in chemistry from Wadham College, Oxford.
After spells in research and accounting, he joined the opencast division in
1982 and started his present job in 1988.
Celtic's selection as preferred candidate this week was not greeted with
universal joy by the people who work for him. Some of British Coal's
employees say he is too remote from them and has yet to prove himself as a
businessman. 'He can supervise getting the coal out of the ground,' said
one. 'But, like the rest of us, he has not had to worry too much about
finances.'
But among senior British Coal executives Mr Riddleston is given some of the
credit for the doubling of production from the regions' opencast operations
to about 3m tonnes in the period he has headed it.
One executive said: 'With opencast mining the key to success is not so much
getting the coal out of the ground but developing new sites. He has
established good relations with local authorities and kept the environmental
lobby at bay. He deserves his success.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Overseas earnings by consultants fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The net overseas earnings of UK professional consultants fell slightly last
year, figures released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday show.
Consultants, defined as including professions such as engineers, architects
and accountants, earned a net Pounds 1.34bn last year, down from Pounds
1.41bn in 1992. The biggest contribution came from the legal profession,
which earned a net Pounds 500m, up from Pounds 473m in 1992.
Accountants and surveyors recorded the sharpest increases in net overseas
earnings over the two years, but there were steep declines in the earnings
recorded by architects and advertisers. Apart from lawyers, consulting
engineers made the biggest contribution, with net earnings of Pounds 240m.
The biggest market for UK consultants was the European Union, with 49 per
cent of the net total. Asia was second, with 24 per cent. The UK had only a
small surplus with the Americas, mainly because its imports from the region
were higher than from any other area.
The net overseas earnings of consultants have declined steadily in recent
years, after peaking at Pounds 1.61bn in 1990.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Molyneaux gambles on lasting peace: So far, the UUP is
backing its leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Ulster Unionists, the province's main political party, gather in
Carrickfergus today for their annual conference, Protestants and Roman
Catholics remain far apart.
Both nationalist groups - Sinn Fein and the moderate Social Democratic
Labour party - are opposed to any form of 'internal solution', while
unionists stick to the principle that no change to the status of Northern
Ireland can take place without the agreement of the majority.
With the emergence this week of a potential third force in unionist
politics, with the disavowal of violence by loyalist paramilitaries, there
is a danger that unionism, already riven by bitter dispute between the UUP
and the more hardline church-based Democratic Unionists led by Rev Ian
Paisley, will be further fragmented.
Loyalist paramilitaries would appear to share the view of the UUP leader, Mr
James Molyneaux, that 'the union is safe'. The DUP remains more sceptical.
Mr Peter Robinson, Mr Paisley's would-be heir, said in the Irish Times
yesterday that it was 'folly to rely upon the word of any man, especially
one who has publicly lied about Northern Ireland in the past'.
Mr Molyneaux, pilloried by hardliners, risks being seen as another
politician selling out unionist interests. Ominously, some are comparing his
performance with the late Brian Faulkner, unionist leader and Northern
Ireland premier, who was forced to resign after criticism of his signature
of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1973. Some worry that current negotiations
go much further than Sunningdale.
Mr Molyneaux has put his political reputation on the line by endorsing a
deal being drawn up between London and Dublin which at the very least will
seek to increase Dublin's role in the affairs of the province. None the
less, even if the policy fails and the violence resumes, observers believe
Mr Molyneaux could still emerge with honour for having given peace a chance.
Mr Chris McGimpsey, a UUP councillor, said: 'There's no point in us giving
concessions to the nationalists in negotiations if we can't deliver our
people. We're not going to cross the Faulkner line,' So far, there is no
sign of dissent within UUP ranks. Mr Molyneaux has shown himself a skilful
party manager, balancing the different shades of opinion, and giving real
powers to some of his brighter lieutenants - Mr Ken Maginnis, his security
spokesman, or Mr David Trimble, who advises on legal issues. The impression
is often that these men, not Mr Molyneaux, are driving policy.
Mr Molyneaux's line in backing the UK government is now seen to have been
taken up by the political representatives of the loyalist paramilitaries,
with Mr David Ervine of the Progressive Unionists saying Protestants had
nothing to fear from the framework document which London and Dublin are
expected to conclude in the next two months.
And unlike Mr Paisley, some in the UUP have acknowledged that if the IRA was
to announce a permanent ceasefire, Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
could be drawn into the democratic process. The fringe parties now
representing loyalist opinion also concede that they may be in talks with
Sinn Fein in the near future.
With the loyalist ceasefire, and after this weekend's UUP conference, Mr
Major will be in a much better position to assess the unionist mood and
judge whether the time is right to start the process of bringing Sinn Fein
into talks.

FT  15 OCT 94 / BBC secures lottery showtime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Camelot, the National Lottery operator, has reached agreement with the BBC
on televising the draw that could create millionaires most weeks between
November 19 and September 2001.
An official announcement of the deal, the result of months of negotiations
between Camelot, the BBC and the Office of the National Lottery, is expected
early next month.
The hope is that the opening hour-long programme, to be hosted by Noel
Edmonds, might top the UK television ratings with a potential audience of
between 18m and 20m. The expectation is that the regular half-hour programme
will probably be scheduled at about 8pm on BBC 1 and could challenge
programmes such as Coronation Street and EastEnders for the top slot in the
ratings.
All around the world live television is a big part of generating publicity
and excitement for national lotteries. The Camelot-BBC approach is for a
relatively unusual programme by international standards - there are unlikely
to be magicians or dancing girls.
Choosing the six winning numbers out of 49, with a seventh ball to chose
intermediate Pounds 100,000 winners, is likely to take only a couple of
minutes. One of the formats under consideration would involve other games of
chance. Other elements could involve good news - human interest stories of
winners and how the prizes will affect their lives, although players will
have a right to privacy if they choose.
As money starts to flow to the five good causes which will benefit from the
National Lottery proceeds - the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the
national heritage and sports - there will also be stories about how the
money is being spent. The programme will be under the overall control of Mr
Michael Leggo, head of entertainment at BBC Television.
When Camelot launches its scratch-cards in addition to the main computerised
draw in the spring there will be a second mid-week programme.
The Camelot consortium, which brings together Cadbury Schweppes, Racal
Electronics, De La Rue, GTech and ICL, wanted to launch with the BBC from
the start.
Not only was the corporation seen as the right environment to launch what
Camelot hopes will become a national institution in its own right, but the
BBC could also offer national, regional and local radio coverage.
The Camelot approach has been to try to get the best of both worlds by
putting the draw live on BBC and advertising the lottery on ITV.
ITV, which ruled itself out of the competition to broadcast the draw and
scratch-card competitions - largely, it said, because of regulatory
difficulties, will almost certainly run the winning numbers within seconds
of the BBC draw.
Mr Nicholas Hinton, the chief executive of the Millennium Commission, was
last night dismissed just before formally taking office.
The issue that led to Mr Hinton's departure - his appointment was due to
become permanent on Monday morning - appears to have involved a definition
of his role. The commissioners may have been more 'hands-on' than Mr Hinton
expected.
Mr Michael Montague, one of the millennium commissioners, said last night:
'I felt either we accepted the way things were developing or we did
something about it and the right time was before Monday.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / City plans business levy to boost transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to establish a private-sector fund worth up to Pounds 500m, financed
from a business levy, to pay for improvements to London's ageing transport
infrastructure are expected to be announced by the City Corporation soon.
A report by the London School of Economics establishing the best method of
raising private funds is expected to be published by the corporation in the
next few weeks.
This is likely to recommend a voting mechanism which would allow businesses
to choose directly which projects they wished to support. The corporation
hopes this would overcome potential Treasury opposition. Should the Treasury
decide that the financing scheme should be included as part of public sector
borrowing it would be disallowed.
Under the plan companies operating in central London would pay an additional
levy, based on the business rate, to an independently managed fund. This
would be able to use the income to raise money in the international bond
market.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the City's policy and resources committee,
said a central London fund might be expected initially to raise a total of
between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m.
He said similar schemes existed in a number of foreign cities. A payroll tax
on employers in Paris had helped pay for the development of the RER
high-speed underground railway network.
Mr Cassidy said a London fund, based on partnership between business and
local authorities, could help finance projects from small local schemes
approved by businesses in individual boroughs to projects benefiting the
capital as a whole.
This might include a business contribution to projects such as CrossRail, a
Pounds 2bn scheme to improve the capital's east-west rail links, which was
rejected earlier this year by a parliamentary committee and which the
government is still seeking to revive.
London businesses have complained consistently about the poor state of the
capital's transport systems. Companies may be encouraged to accept a small
levy, given that local authority business rates in London are expected to
fall next year.
A study by the London School of Economics last year estimated that an
additional penny rate would raise Pounds 38m a year in inner London and
Pounds 54m in Greater London.
The Treasury has steadfastly opposed taxes dedicated to single purposes but
other ministers are more likely to support the scheme, given the slow
progress of the government's private finance initiative.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Cost of motor and house insurance drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of motor and house insurance is tumbling as a result of
increasingly intense price skirmishes between UK insurance companies.
Big insurance groups confirmed yesterday that premiums on many motor,
building and house content policies had fallen significantly in the past
year.
The drop reflects the increased profitability of underwriting domestic
insurance, after two years of sharp premium increases. But it suggests
higher profit margins will not be sustained, particularly as the growth of
the direct insurers, which sell by telephone and advertising, forces prices
down.
For consumers, recent falls may be reversed by the government's imposition
of 2.5 per cent insurance premium tax this month - although some companies
are absorbing at least a part of the increase.
A survey by investment bank SG Warburg this week suggested motor premiums
will drop about 5 per cent this year. Similarly, research by AA Insurance
suggested that if the insurance tax is excluded, house building and contents
premiums dropped 2 per cent between July and October.
Although companies say premiums have fallen partly because of improved risk
assesment - and not all motor or house premiums will fall - price is
becoming increasingly important, particularly in motor insurance.
Direct Line, which last year became the UK's biggest motor insurer, said:
'Competition is hotting up. Consumers should see very competitive rates over
the coming year.'
Ms Gill Clark, marketing manager at Eagle Star, said premiums on the
company's motor and contents policies had fallen between 5 per cent and 8
per cent in the past year.
Falling prices might persuade building societies to set up their own
insurance operations if, as expected, they are given the legal freedom to do
so, rather than sell composite insurers' policies.
Mr Desmond Hudson, Britannia building society's head of lending, said his
group was considering forming its own Lloyd's of London syndicate to
underwrite policies.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Judgment deals blow to Merrett Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal action brought by almost 2,000 Lloyd's Names against the Merrett
syndicate 418 suffered a setback yesterday when a High Court judge dismissed
the claims made by almost half those who sustained losses.
Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that the claims of almost 1,000 of the Merrett
Names had been made 'out of time' and therefore could not go to a full
trial. Lawyers acting on behalf of the Names said they would appeal.
The Merrett Names are one of the three biggest groups of losers, along with
those belonging to the Gooda Walker and Feltrim syndicates.
Names on syndicate 418 sustained substantial losses in the 1985 year over
asbestosis and pollution claims. To date these losses total Pounds 135m but
the account has not yet been closed because of uncertainty about the scale
of liability claims.
Names estimate their losses could rise to about Pounds 765m.
The position of the Names affected by yesterday's ruling has always been in
doubt because they failed to register their claims within the statutory
six-year limitation period. They became members of the syndicate before 1984
but did not issue their writs until last year.
In a preliminary hearing the Names said that they should be exempted from
the six-year rule. They said that they did not have sufficient information
to bring a claim until May 1990 and that important knowledge that affected
their actions was deliberately concealed from them.
The judge dismissed their applications, ruling that a letter from the
Merrett managing agents sent in April 1985 and subsequent reports and
accounts gave claimants enough information for the six-year period to start
then.
The main action in which the remaining Merrett Names are suing Merrett
Syndicates, its auditors, the then Ernst &amp; Whinney, and the members' agents
is set to start in March next year. Although the damages sought have never
been quantified, a figure of Pounds 160m was thought probable.
However, Mr Simon Roper of Oswald Hickson, solicitors for the members'
agents, said the ruling had reduced both the scale and the scope of the
trial. The damages sought would be less and the issues would be restricted
to questions of reinsurance rather than whether the original contracts
should have been written.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Major prepares Tories for talks with Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday began preparing the Conservative party for talks
between the government and republican leaders while insisting that he would
not be rushed into a premature response to the loyalist and IRA ceasefires.
As Northern Ireland enjoyed its first day free from the threat of sectarian
violence for 25 years the prime minister told Conservatives in Bournemouth
that his cautious approach had paid dividends. 'If I had listened (to those
urging me to hurry) we would not today be where we are with the guns stilled
and the bombs stopped,' he said.
But he balanced this with an assurance that the government would enter the
'window for peace' if it could do so 'with honour and with consent'.
He said: 'We cannot let history freeze us into inaction.'
His speech followed a lunch-time telephone conversation with Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in which the two men took stock of
recent developments.
They discussed the much-delayed framework document with which their two
governments hope to inject momentum into the political talks process
involving the province's main constitutional parties, but are not thought to
have fixed a date for their next meeting.
Downing Street said both prime ministers were 'greatly encouraged by the
loyalist ceasefire in the context of overall progress over the past six
weeks'.
Dublin described the exchange - which came after Mr Reynolds reacted to
Thursday's loyalist announcement by urging Mr Major to respond positively to
the new situation - as 'very useful'.
The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues
next week. Ministers have acknowledged that talks could start by Christmas.
Sinn Fein representatives will probably have started by this time to
participate in Dublin's Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which Mr
Reynolds expects to get running next month.
The forum will be attended by all leading political parties in the Irish
Republic as well as the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party
and the non-sectarian Alliance party. Unionists have declined to take part.
Speaking on the eve of the Ulster Unionist party conference in
Carrickfergus, Mr Major paid tribute to Mr James Molyneaux, saying the UUP
leader had been right that the most significant aspect of the 44-day-old IRA
ceasefire was 'the victory of ordinary people over the terrorists'.
The loyalist ceasefire was 'another victory for ordinary people', he said.
'Today, for the first time in a quarter of a century, the people of Ulster
have woken up to peace. Our determination must be to make that peace
permanent.'
Speaking within days of the 10th anniversary of the Brighton bomb, when the
IRA attempted to murder the British cabinet, he sought to reassure unionists
that British troops would not be withdrawn from Ulster prematurely.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Life body chief backs disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life insurance companies charge too much for their products and costs will
have to come down once sales agents are required to disclose commissions,
the head of the life insurance industry's trade association said yesterday.
'Commission disclosure will draw attention to the substantial differences
between the operating costs of life offices,' said Mr Mark Boleat,
director-general of the Association of British Insurers, in an unusually
frank speech to members. 'This should stimulate competition which will drive
down costs. In general, the industry's costs are too high for the product
which is being sold.'
Mr Boleat also attacked those of his members who have been publicly
criticising the efforts of regulators in recent years to force disclosure
and to end bad selling practices.
'The unseemly wrangling which went on prior to the establishment of the
Personal Investment Authority did the industry no good at all,' Mr Boleat
said. 'It gave the impression of an industry fighting to avoid effective
regulation and moreover one that was at odds with itself on how regulation
should be achieved.'
Until recently, Mr Boleat said, the life insurance industry has been
inadequately regulated. The improved regulation provided by the PIA should
help improve its tarnished image, he said.
Mr Boleat, who was addressing a conference on life insurance, added:
'Regulation in the life industry is essential because in the absence of
regulation there would be no reward in being virtuous.'
The life insurance industry has for years resisted regulations requiring it
to tell prospective customers about costs generally and about sales agents'
commissions in particular. But that information will have to be disclosed
from January.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Heseltine leads business visit to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, left London yesterday
for the first visit to Kuala Lumpur by a cabinet minister since Malaysia
ended a seven-month trade dispute.
The visit marks a significant warming of the relationship between London and
Kuala Lumpur, which was deeply strained by British newspaper reports of
attempts by UK companies to bribe Malaysian officials.
In a sign of the importance attached to the trip by the government, Mr
Heseltine was accompanied by a big group of senior businesspeople from
manufacturing, construction and service companies.
He will meet several Malaysian ministers for talks, including Dr Mahathir
Mohamad, prime minister, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister, and Mr
Rafidah Aziz, trade minister.
Mr Heseltine said the visit was intended 'to explore ways in which we can
build on our existing relationship by identifying new areas of
co-operation'.
Malaysia gave no reasons for its decision five weeks ago to end its ban on
government contracts for UK companies. The embargo is believed to have
caused substantial damage to British businesses.
The ban excluded companies such as GEC, Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House
from bidding for potentially lucrative contracts for South East Asia's
largest infrastructure project, an international airport south of Kuala
Lumpur.
British bidders were also excluded from tendering for some contracts in
Malaysia's power sector and for some construction projects. The ban did not
prevent British companies from continuing to bid for private-sector
business.
The businessmen travelling to Malaysia include Dr Terry Harrison, chief
executive of Rolls-Royce; Sir Colin Chandler, chairman of Vickers; Sir Robin
Biggam, chairman of BICC; Sir John Banham, chairman of Tarmac; Mr Douglas
Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom; and Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing.
Mr Heseltine said: 'The Far East market is a real test for the
competitiveness of British companies. The opportunities are there. We must
seize them before other countries do.'
Britain's relations with Malaysia had been difficult even before the trade
dispute as Dr Mahathir followed a 'buy British last' policy for almost a
decade in retaliation against increases in fees for foreign students at UK
universities.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Accountants set up review body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday
confirmed it has set up a working party to consider the future regulation of
the profession.
The move, which marks a watershed in the institute's attitude to the present
system of self-regulation, brings the professional debate on standards into
the public arena.
The review will be seen as another blow to efforts to forge agreement on
reform between the six leading accountancy bodies which meet on the
so-called Bishop committee.
Mr Chris Swinson, a partner with BDO Stoy Hayward, will chair the working
party, which will bring proposals before the institute's annual conference
in January.
Mr Swinson said: 'The paper will review tensions which exist in the
regulatory framework and ways in which they can be relieved.'
The move brought a sharp reaction from the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants (ACCA), which recently floated plans for a general
accounting council for the profession.
That plan was described by Mr Roger Lawson, the institute's president, as
'dead on arrival' and an abdication of the profession's responsibilities.
Ms Anthea Rose, ACCA chief executive, said yesterday: 'There appears to be
confusion in the institute hierarchy about what it actually does want.'
The institute's review is likely to focus on trends such as rising public
expectations of accountability and the loss of privileges in the profession.
Mr Andrew Colquhoun, the institute's chief executive, said the debate
mirrored that in other professions facing regulatory problems, such as
lawyers and chartered surveyors.
Mr Swinson said there were tensions between the role of the institute in
regulating standards on behalf of the government and its traditional role in
monitoring ethics and training.
The institute said its plans for a review pre-dated ACCA's announcement of
its scheme for a general accounting council. It saw debate about structures
as following on a long debate on the issues.
The working party's other members are all senior members of the institute's
council. They are Mr John Collier, Mr Douglas Llambias, and Mr Ian McNeil,
former president.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Dame Shirley leads Westminster auditor down legal side
street: Hearings over allegations of 'homes-for-votes' could now be shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dame Shirley Porter, the former leader of the Conservative 'flagship'
council of Westminster, is a formidable opponent.
Monday was to have seen the start of hearings by the council's district
auditor, Mr John Magill, on whether he was correct in his provisional ruling
that she and eight others should pay Pounds 21.25m in surcharges to repay
money wasted on an alleged scheme to rig the 1990 local elections by selling
homes in the borough.
At the hearings on Monday he would have allowed both sides to give their
version of events before making a final decision on the surcharge, which he
can enforce.
But yesterday afternoon Mr Magill announced that he was postponing the
hearings after requests from Dame Shirley's legal team. Her lawyers are
arguing that Mr Magill, who now has 'quasi-judicial powers' should not
officiate as he has already investigated the case and given a provisional
view.
Mr Anthony Scrivener, the barrister and former chairman of the Bar, who has
been retained by Dame Shirley, last week tried to persuade Mr Magill that he
should disqualify himself from taking any further part in the case.
Mr Scrivener said: 'A judge does not announce his findings, provisional or
otherwise, halfway through a case.'
Mr Magill appears to be taking the arguments seriously, and so Monday's
session, in the Westminster city council chamber in Marylebone Road, will be
devoted to legal arguments over whether he should hear the case. If he
disqualifies himself, he said yesterday, the hearings into the
homes-for-votes allegations 'will not take place'.
The hearings are potentially deeply embarrassing for a government now
preoccupied with rebutting allegations of 'sleaze', as the national
Conservative party had strong links with Dame Shirley's regime.
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, hailed Dame Shirley's council
as a 'flagship', and the Tories' victory there in the 1990 council election
was proclaimed as a vindication of the poll tax, which was introduced that
year. Dame Shirley and her colleagues protest that they did nothing wrong,
merely implemented policies which they were elected to put in place. If the
hearings do take place, they are expected to last between six and eight
weeks.
Labour councillors who made the first objections to the policy will make
their case first.
They have hired Mr Andrew Arden, a barrister, who will be able to quote from
the 6,000 pages of documentary evidence collected by the auditor but not
previously published, including confidential council documents.
Their attack will concentrate on the policy of 'designated sales', in which
council flats were left empty until a buyer could be found for them. The
objectors say that the aim was to replace council tenants, likely to vote
Labour, with owner-occupiers who would be more likely to vote Conservative.
After 1987, when the policy was expanded, these properties were concentrated
in eight marginal wards, where the Tories believed the next election would
be decided.
Mr Magill's provisional view endorsed this allegation. He said he was minded
to find that electoral advantage was 'the driving force behind the policy of
increased designated sales' and that this also influenced the selection of
properties designated for sale.
Provisionally, he said the council had been engaged in 'gerrymandering',
which was 'a disgraceful and improper purpose'. The recommended surcharge
relates to spending on the designated sales programme between 1987 and 1989.
The 10 people recommended for surcharge were Dame Shirley, Mr Barry Legg,
now MP for Milton Keynes SW; Mr David Weeks, council leader after Dame
Shirley resigned in 1991; former councillors Mr Peter Hartley, Michael Dutt,
who has since died, and Ms Judith Warner; Mr Bill Phillips, former managing
director; Mr Robert Lewis, formerly the council's deputy solicitor; Mr
Graham England, housing director; and Mr Paul Hayler, divisional director in
the housing department.
According to professional valuations commissioned by Mr Magill the council
lost Pounds 13.3m by selling the properties at a discount to their
open-market values. Homeless families were put into temporary hotels while
council flats were left vacant. Accommodation costs were more than Pounds
2m.
Mr Magill added that the number of homeless households placed in temporary
accommodation increased by 172 each year while the policy was in force and
that the net revenue costs to the council increased by more than Pounds 1.5m
each year.
But the objectors will also say that the designated sales were only part of
a broader strategy of 'social cleansing' which involved planning and
environmental policies.
Dame Shirley will also have the chance to put her case. Westminster council
started the designated sales policy, in a limited form, in 1974 and it
continued until January. Dame Shirley and her colleagues were elected on a
platform of selling council houses.
Westminster officials say the council has unique problems. House prices are
among the highest in the UK, more than half being valued at Pounds 120,000
or more, making it prohibitively expensive to accommodate homeless people in
the borough. Space for new housing developments is limited.
According to the council only 21 per cent of Westminster homes were owned by
their occupiers in 1981. This figure rose to 35 per cent after the
designated sales policy was implemented - still well below the national
average of about 60 per cent. The council says designated sales were
intended 'to generate home ownership opportunities to meet the massive
unfulfilled demand'.

FT  15 OCT 94 / BA to end Concorde service to Dulles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Airways yesterday said it was suspending its loss-making Concorde
scheduled service between London and Washington DC after 18 years.
BA, which will continue to operate its profitable twice-daily London-New
York Concorde services, plans to develop supersonic charter flights for the
US market.
After the end of its thrice-weekly scheduled Concorde Washington service
from November 8 BA will permanently base one of its seven Concordes at New
York's JFK airport.
The airline yesterday said there was increasing US demand for Concorde
charter flights.
BA has already won business to operate a weekly Concorde charter flight
between New York and Barbados for three months starting in December. The
flight takes two hours and 20 minutes - half the subsonic journey time.
BA said: 'We see possibilities for expanding charter services from New York
to South America, Bermuda and Mexico.'
The scheduled Washington service, which was Concorde's first transatlantic
route, has averaged passenger loads of only 30 per cent compared with an
average of about 70 per cent for the New York service, which has round-trip
ticket prices of more than Pounds 5,000.
The suspension of BA's service to Washington's Dulles airport means that New
York is the only US destination served by regular supersonic scheduled
services from London Heathrow - operated by BA - and Paris Charles de
Gaulle, operated by Air France.
Air France has already stopped scheduled Concorde flights between Paris and
Washington.

FT  15 OCT 94 / DTI jumped the gun on aid for Jaguar X200 project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford, the US carmaker, has not yet applied for state aid to build a new
range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons in the UK, the Department of Trade
and Industry said yesterday.
The department withdrew a statement made last weekend that the government
had already 'made an offer' to Ford and that it was now 'discussing the
details'.
The earlier statement had arisen from an 'internal misunderstanding' between
its officials. It said: 'We have received no formal application, and no
offer has been made. We are aware, however, that the company may be seeking
funds in due course.'
Earlier the government was forced to provide about Pounds 9.5m in selective
regional aid to persuade Ford to build the successor to the Jaguar XJS
sportscar in Coventry rather than in Portugal.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said last week that the
Pounds 9.5m grant for the XJS replacement project 'would pale by comparison'
with the aid needed to ensure that the sports saloon, codenamed X200, is
built in the UK.
The company is studying the alternatives of building the new car range
either at Jaguar's Coventry plant or at one of its US plants in Michigan.
Ford has for the past couple of years been preparing a project to build a
range of smaller Jaguar sports saloons. A formal decision is not expected
until next year.
The Jaguar is expected to be developed from the same chassis platform as a
new range of luxury cars to be sold under Ford's Lincoln/Mercury brandnames.
The new car would be an addition to the Jaguar range and would more than
double output to more than 100,000 a year by 1998-99. The car is planned for
launch in 1998.
Jaguar was yesterday reported as offering workers a two-year pay deal worth
up to 8 per cent affecting up to 4,500 hourly paid workers. The deal comes a
week after Rover agreed two-year deals worth an average 10.7 per cent for
its workers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of people in prison has risen to more than 50,000, the highest
level since 1988, the Prison Service said yesterday.
Prison officers warned last night that jails faced riots as a result of
overcrowding as prison governors attributed the increase in inmates to
growing numbers of prisoners on remand.
Twenty-one new prisons with 11,285 places built since 1985 have proved
insufficient.

Nearly 1.5m local-government employees will get pay rises ranging from 4 per
cent to 6 per cent spread over 19 months for blue-collar staff and 21 months
for white-collar staff.
The two-stage deal, which was agreed yesterday, brings together the
settlement dates for both groups and ushers in a harmonisation of
conditions.
Mr Jack Dromey, national official of the TGWU general union, welcomed the
step as 'the end of second-class status for blue-collar workers'.
Although the pay offer was increased slightly yesterday it is at the lower
end of settlements, especially for white-collar staff.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Efforts stepped up to sell Swans yard: Receivers and unions
hope buyer will emerge to continue Tyne shipbuilding tradition at Wallsend
facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attempts to sell Swan Hunter's Wallsend yard, if possible for shipbuilding
use, are to be stepped up with separate initiatives planned by the Tyneside
company's union campaigners and receivers.
Mr Dick Gonsalez, chairman of the Tyne and Blyth Confederation of
Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions at Swans, said yesterday that while he
was sad at the break-up of the company's assets, ending hopes of a
going-concern sale, Thursday's disposals of its Hebburn and Neptune yards
could improve sale prospects for Wallsend, the company's main shipbuilding
facility.
Mr Gonsalez said the union campaign to save shipbuilding on the Tyne would
continue.
And joint receiver Mr Gordon Horsfield, of Price Waterhouse, said he was
planning a new worldwide advertising campaign, probably in early November,
focusing on the Wallsend yard.
He said: 'I would like to see the Wallsend yard bought by a company of
substance that has pockets deep enough to make the necessary investment to
re-establish it as one of the world's leading shipbuilding yards.'
The receivers said there had been some expression of interest for Wallsend.
Yesterday Mr Eric Welsh, managing director of Tees Dockyard, said his
company's acquisition of the Hebburn site and its huge dry dock meant
Britain could repair large vessels which had previously gone to Germany,
Sweden, France and Spain.
The Hebburn dry dock, 259 metres long and 44 metres wide with the capacity
to take 150,000 tonne ships, is the biggest on Britain's east coast.
Mr Welsh said that within three weeks the new business, Tyne Tees Dockyard,
should see its first ship arrive at Hebburn, a site little used by Swan
Hunter in recent years.
Mr Welsh, chief executive of the new company, hopes its permanent workforce
will reach 200 in a year, with others on contract.
Ship repairer A &amp; P Appledore, buying the Neptune yard for extensive
refitting of large ships, hopes to create 150 to 200 permanent jobs.
Mr Gonsalez welcomed the prospect of new jobs and the retention of the sites
for marine industry use.
Price Waterhouse has until now put Swans' break-up value at Pounds 7.3m but
it seems that it may fetch nearer Pounds 8.5m. Mr Horsfield said that in the
light of disposals so far more than Pounds 7.3m was likely. Apart from
Wallsend, the other substantial asset to be sold is Swans' UK intellectual
property.
On Monday the unions will ask Price Waterhouse to make November 3, when
Swans' last ship leaves, an open day for past and present employees, their
families and supporters.
Mr Gonsalez said: 'We'd like to see everybody there so we can march back out
with our heads high. They haven't broken the spirit of Tyneside.'
Mr Horsfield said if approached with the request he would make every effort
to accommodate it.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: King of the road keeps to
the straight and narrow - A look at the pitfalls ahead for John Major as he
maps out a future route for the Tory party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's task was straightforward. As one of his senior ministers
confided over dinner in Bournemouth this week, it was 'to keep the wheels on
the coach'. The prime minister succeeded.
The coach could yet career into a ditch called Europe. And its driver faces
a Commons challenger who is busy installing a new engine in Labour's ancient
charabanc.
Next Tuesday Mr Major and Mr Tony Blair will face each other for the first
of the confrontations across the despatch box which will set the mood of
British politics in the run up to the next general election.
There were noisy distractions in Bournemouth - allegations over the business
dealings of Mr Mark Thatcher, Mr Norman Lamont's intervention over Europe,
Mr Michael Portillo's emergence as the unchallenged torch-bearer of the
right.
As the right of the party started to erect its roadblocks to any further
European integration there was a stark warning of the fragile state of the
Tory coalition over which the prime minister presides.
The same ministers who predicted with confidence from the platform that they
would win a fifth general election victory were ready to concede over coffee
that Europe, like the corn laws and tariff reform before it, is an issue
that may tear the party apart.
Some believe the split will happen only if the party is defeated at the
general election. Others fear that if France and Germany force the pace then
Mr Major's government will fracture over the terms of the 1996
intergovernmental conference on the next stage of integration.
But that is for next year, and the year after. This time the Conservative
party left its annual conference in no worst shape than it arrived. It is 20
points or 25 points behind in the polls. It is grumpy, angry, but it is not
in open revolt.
Mr Major himself has looked more relaxed in Bournemouth than at any
conference since the 1992 election. He decided back in May that he wanted
and - more importantly, that he would be able - to stay in 10 Downing
Street. Since then he has started to gather around him a group of ministers
with whom he feels secure. Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, Mrs
Gillian Shepherd, the education secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, are among those in the inner core.
Mr David Hunt, the public services minister, is proving an effective
trouble-shooter, Mr William Waldegrave at agriculture a useful thinker. Mr
Douglas Hurd might well stay on at the Foreign Office until the general
election.
The new confidence showed itself during Mr Major's speech yesterday. It will
not go down as one of the great orations of political history. He is not
that sort of speaker. But it sounded as though it was his own. It started to
show us the direction in which he intends to drive the coach.
The rhetorical battle this week has been won by the right. The conference,
in which year-by-year the envelope stuffers have been edged out by more
committed activists, is more comfortable with the language of nationalism
than with the harsher realities of the world.
But the warm applause for Mr Portillo and his philosophical soulmates went
unheeded by Mr Major. His message was one of caution and pragmatism. There
will be no more shake-ups in the schools, no more cuts in the armed forces,
no more change for the sake of dogma. The prime minister is promising quiet,
conservative, competent government. Mr Michael Heseltine still thinks he can
win his battle to privatise the Post Office. If he does - and it remains a
big if - it will be the last new excursion to the ideological frontiers.
Mr Major, confident that after 15 years the Conservatives have at last found
the formula for steady growth and low inflation, is relying on two more
years of economic recovery to revive the government's fortunes. He cannot
take it for granted.
The shock of adjustment to a low inflation economy has smothered the
feelgood factor. Real personal disposable income, seen by the old hands in
the cabinet as the unchallenged determinant of electoral success, is not
about to take off. The prime minister is offering the security of a stable
economy. The voters might easily prefer pocketfuls of ten-pound notes.
As for Mr Blair, Mr Major has put himself on the side of those determined to
keep the Tories on the centre ground, to cast the Labour leader as a
counterfeit capitalist rather than as a closet communist.
Others in the cabinet - Mr Heseltine among them - prefer a more robust style
and do not worry about the apparent contradictions. But the important
message from Mr Major was that there will be no lurch to the right.
All this adds up to a plausible but precarious strategy. Mr Blair has more
ideas for Labour. His strategy also is to address the electorate's sense of
insecurity - as leader of a government that would manage change. If the
government's opinion poll ratings do not improve quite soon, Mr Major's
message of consolidation will not be enough for the Tory MPs in the party's
marginal constituencies.
But the biggest threat comes still from Europe. Mr Major said yesterday he
wanted to keep his coach on a European road. The Tory right could yet force
it into a ditch.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Gloomy feelings persist at
grassroots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They may have cheered Mr John Major to the rafters. But yesterday, as the
Tory conference representatives streamed out of Bournemouth, many had still
not shaken off the cloud of depression that has dogged them all week.
'It's been a marvellous week and there have been some great speeches,' said
Mr Bill Brum, a veteran Conservative party activist from Southend. 'But it
hasn't made much difference. The party is still in the doldrums.'
Throughout the week, the party has shown a decisive and determined face to
the television cameras. Delegates have given cabinet ministers standing
ovations. They have unfailingly passed the anodyne motions presented by
organisers. They have denounced Mr Tony Blair, the new Labour leader, for
stealing Tory slogans. But as the glitz surrounding Mr Major's speech faded
away, some were wondering how on earth the party could reduce Labour's
30-point lead in the polls.
'The divisions over the Maastricht Treaty weren't nearly as bad as what we
have now,' said Mr Robert Halfon from Vauxhall in south London. 'This week
everyone has been divided over everything: over tax, Europe, Ireland, you
name it. And we have done little to resolve that.'
Some feared the party had failed to meet the challenge posed by Mr Blair.
'If Blair can get the Clause 4 issue settled then he is well on the way to
victory,' predicted Mrs Kathy Darroch from a constituency in south-east
England.
Others felt that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, had failed to give a
clear lead in the fight against crime. 'We needed a far more decisive move
towards ID cards,' said one delegate. 'Without it, Labour can still
challenge us on the crime issue.'
There was plenty of confidence that it will all get better from here. 'One
of the best things this week is that Jeremy Hanley saved his reputation as
party chairman,' said Mr Robert White-Adams from Weston-super-Mare.
But the overwhelming concern of campaigners was that this great annual
jamboree would be followed by the grim task of drumming up local support in
the constituencies.
'The conference is really a stitch-up,' said Mrs Maureen Mallet, from
Maidenhead. 'The reality is that the party is coming apart at the roots.
Getting supporters - especially young ones - is a near impossible task.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Country is exhorted to
'set its sights high again'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an optimistic assessment of the long-term prospects for the economy Mr
John Major told the Conservative conference yesterday that the British
people had the opportunity to double their standard of living in the next 25
years.
He won a 5 1/2 -minute ovation for a wide-ranging speech in which he
promised to hold to Conservative principles in facing the challenge from Mr
Tony Blair's new model Labour party.
Mr Major reaffirmed his determination to oppose federalist developments in
the European Union and to ensure that any political settlement in Northern
Ireland was acceptable to the people of the province.
The economy
The prime minister said that the progress already made in achieving
sustainable growth coupled with low inflation provided the opportunity for
the country to 'set its sights high again'.
Recalling the target set by Mr RA Butler when he was Conservative chancellor
in 1954, he said: 'With the right determination, with the right policies, we
have the chance once again to double our living standards in the next 25
years.'
Mr Major reinforced the earlier warning by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that prudence must govern the timing of tax cuts and insisted
that there must be no return to the 'boom-and-bust cycle' of earlier years.
For this reason it was sometimes necessary to be a 'bit puritanical'.
European Union
Looking forward to the inter-governmental conference in 1996 Mr Major
pledged that if he was not satisfied he would 'just say no' to changes which
would harm Britain.
But he hoped to secure an acceptable agreement because that would be in the
best interests of Britain.
In the wider context of foreign affairs he cited the speed with which the
latest crisis in the Middle East had blown up, and said: 'Isolationism is a
luxury Britain simply cannot afford.'
Northern Ireland
Mr Major said he would take his 'own time' in responding to the decision by
the loyalist paramilitaries to maintain a ceasefire for as long as that
declared by the IRA. While other people called for speed he had to ask the
'hard questions'.
Mr Major said: 'For as long as is necessary, as many policemen and troops as
are necessary will stay on duty in Northern Ireland to protect all the
people of Northern Ireland.'
Nursery education
Proposals would be 'worked up' by Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education
secretary, to provide places for all four-year-olds whose parents wished to
take them up.
Health
Denying that the government intended to privatise the National Health
Service, Mr Major said that the security of mind it provided would not be
taken away 'while I live and breathe'.
Crime
While rejecting criticism of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, the
prime minister acknowledged the need for a more stringent regime in prisons.
Prisons should be decent and Spartan and their role was to 'punish and not
pamper'.
Mr Major said the home secretary was in agreement with him that where this
was not the case it would have to change.
Details are to be announced next week of the most comprehensive campaign
against drug dealers and traffickers yet launched in Britain.
Labour's tax targets
Stressing the difference between Labour and the Conservatives on personal
taxation, Mr Major said: 'People who have earned well, people who have
saved, people who have inherited the fruits of a parent's lifetime work are
not the 'undeserving rich'.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: John and Gill go up the
hill to fetch a pail of voters - Plans to expand nursery education are
likely to be very popular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is not the first time Mr John Major has talked of his ambition to
expand nursery education, which yesterday became a 'cast-iron commitment'
for all 4-year-olds.
Last December, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'It would
be an ambition of mine over time to move to universal nursery education, but
I stress that is an ambition. We do not at the moment have detailed plans to
do so. We don't have the resources.'
At that time the then education secretary Mr John Patten was dismissive of
the idea, saying it was 'too expensive'.
His successor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, seems rather more sympathetic. Her
reaction yesterday was to say: 'This is terrific news. I and my department
are now geared up for early action.' She intends to complete the 'first
wave' of expansion in the lifetime of this parliament.
The department is still consulting with different interested groups on how
the expansion should be managed. However, Mr Major's speech was taken as a
hint that the government hoped to provide 'vouchers' which could be used to
pay for either private or public nursery provision. He said: 'It must
promote diversity and parental choice and it must be carefully targeted in a
way that expands and does not crowd out the private and voluntary
provision.'
Several factors suggest expanded nursery education could be popular. First,
the sharp increase in the take-up of private nursery care suggests there is
rising demand among the middle classes.
Figures produced by the National Commission on Education showed that numbers
in private nurseries increased by 259 per cent between 1980 and 1991, from
22,017 to 79,029, while the numbers left with childminders more than
doubled. Over the same period provision by local authority day nurseries had
dropped.
Secondly, the UK performs poorly in international comparisons. Estimates for
1991 (the most recent figures available) published by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development suggest that the UK trails countries
such as Germany, France and Belgium in nursery provision. In the UK 60.7 per
cent of four-year-olds were in education, compared with 100 per cent in
France, 99.4 per cent in Belgium and 70.6 per cent in Germany.
Several educationalists have published reports in the last year calling for
nursery expansion. The National Commission on Education, an independent
educational think-tank whose launch was welcomed by Mr Major, called for the
phased introduction of universal provision. Its wanted to see 95 per cent of
four-year-olds and 85 per cent of three-year-olds in nursery school by 2010.
The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce
went further, calling for the compulsory school age to be raised from five
to six, so that resources could be recycled to offer free half-day learning
for all children from the ages of three to five.
Both bodies felt such moves would tackle the UK's growing problems with
adult illiteracy and innumeracy.
Mr Major's pledge may also have been influenced by Labour's exploitation of
the issue. Provision is currently at the discretion of local education
authorities, and Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, this year
published Department for Education figures showing that 40 per cent of three
and four-year-olds are provided with nursery education under Labour
authorities, compared with 13 per cent in Conservative boroughs.
Political reaction was lukewarm. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats
pointed out that former prime minister Baroness Thatcher had pledged 22
years ago, when education secretary, to introduce universal nursery
education for all three and four-year-olds.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Portillo the young
pretender triumphs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Elgar ringing in their ears, Conservative activists left Bournemouth
yesterday reflecting on a week that produced little glory but rekindled
hopes that the party might yet recover to win a fifth successive general
election.
Unlike last week's Labour gathering in Blackpool, the 111th Tory party
conference passed with little sense of occasion, and no great victories or
defeats for the leadership.
But Bournemouth was not equally kind to the nearly two dozen ministers who
addressed the troops. At least three left with their reputations enhanced.
The great bulk did little or nothing to affect their standing. One - a
surprise - was a relative failure.
The winners were led by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Buoyed by the
absence of a challenge to his leadership he wrapped himself in the union
flag to deliver a relaxed and confident speech designed to send supporters
away happy.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, was a surprise success. He had a bad
start, failing to turn up when he was expected. But the representatives gave
a warm welcome to his two speeches, laughing at his jokes and cheering his
anti-Labour sallies.
The other winner was Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, whose
four-minute ovation for a clearly anti-European speech was the longest of
the week - except for Mr Major's 5 1/2 minutes.
Mr Portillo appeared to have widened his support among rank-and-file
activists, but some good judges are already saying that he may come to
regret identifying himself so closely with factional politics.
The surprise loser was Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
who won only a two-minute ovation and seemed to have lost his unofficial
title of conference darling to Mr Portillo. However, Mr Heseltine achieved
his main aim - showing that he remains as vigorous a performer as ever
following his recovery from a heart attack last year.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, delivered a good speech poorly, throwing
away most of the best lines, but was able to claim wide support for his
steady-as-she-goes economic policy.
The debate on law and order was expected to prompt criticism of Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary, but did not. Mr Howard was booed only when he made
clear that the government favoured voluntary rather than compulsory ID
cards.
Among the cabinet middleweights Mrs Gillian Shephard made a confident debut
as education secretary, even though her best ideas were appropriated by the
prime minister for his end-of-conference speech.
Others, including Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary,
delivered largely routine speeches without adding significantly to their
support.
The two cabinet newcomers who addressed the conference, Dr Brian Mawhinney
at transport and Mr Stephen Dorrell at national heritage, were both regarded
as solid performers, likely to risk a more aggressive approach next year.
There were other winners and losers. Conservative Way Forward, the rightwing
lobby group, won the battle of the fringe with the biggest and best attended
meetings. In a sign of the times, the Campaign for Europe achieved only a
third of last year's turnout, in spite of boasting Sir Leon Brittan, UK
European commissioner, as its main speaker.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Pledge to boost party
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New measures to revitalise rundown party organisations in key marginal
constituencies were announced by Mr Jeremy Hanley, the party chairman.
Responding to a debate dominated by warnings about the need to boost
fund-raising and the number of professionally qualified staff he promised
that 80 new agents would be recruited in the next 18 months.
Mr Hanley promised that any funds raised by constituencies in the next two
years would be channelled to marginal seats.
Mr Richard English, chairman of the National Society of Agents, underlined
the deterioration in the party's organisation by disclosing that there were
only a 'paltry' 204 agents left.
He said it was unacceptable that there were 154 Conservative-held
constituencies without professional agent cover.
Mr Hanley said the 80 new agents would be trained in the most modern
campaigning techniques and employed in key seats through a partnership
arrangement with Tory Central Office.
Mr Hanley said one of the strongest messages he received from the 500
constituency chairmen he saw during a nationwide tour in September was: 'We
must all work together to win.'
To applause he added: 'That goes for our party in parliament too.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Tories wave the union flag
at Blair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang yesterday pledged that the future of the union would be at the
heart of the next general election campaign by the Conservative party - as
he used the issue to launch a sustained attack on Mr Tony Blair.
Signalling that the party's high command thinks it has found a weapon with
which to pierce the new Labour leader's armour, the Scottish secretary
devoted fully one-third of his speech to picking apart Labour's commitment
to devolution for Scotland and Wales.
In a speech that earned him a two-minute standing ovation, Mr Lang conjured
up a picture of a Labour government hamstrung in its first year by its
promise of a bill to set up a Scottish parliament and a Welsh assembly.
The bill would be opposed tooth and nail and would take up 'the entire
parliamentary session' he said. It represented for the moment 'the sum total
of the Blair agenda'.
He added: 'It is an agenda that is undeliverable. And it represents a
failure of judgment of massive proportions.'
As speaker after speaker came to the podium to defend the union Mr Adrian
Lee, national chairman of the Young Conservatives, said he hoped there would
be no return to devolved government in Ulster.
He said: 'Unequivocal unionism is not only principled but it wins votes. If
devolution is wrong in Scotland, England and Wales, why is it right in
Northern Ireland?'
Addressing this question later, Mr Lang argued that the circumstances of
North-ern Ireland were different.
'I am not averse to having different arrangements within an integrated
United Kingdom parliament,' he said. 'Northern Ireland has a democratic
deficit, Scotland does not.'
Mr Lang warned that Scotland would have to pay 'a heavy price' for the
creation of a Scottish parliament, with questions such as the level of
Scottish representation at Westminster and Scottish MPs' right to vote on
all UK matters coming under scrutiny.
He said the government could not go on earmarking funds to ensure 'a level
standard of public services' if Scotland were given the power to raise and
lower its own taxes.
But he acknowledged that Scotland could pull out of the union if it ever
became 'the preponderant and settled view' of the Scots that that was what
they wanted to do.
Mr OJ Williams, a Conservative from Carmarthen, west Wales, said the party
was not opposed to 'true' devolution, meaning the removal of tiers of
administration to give individuals choice over their own lives.
The other parties believed in devolving power to institutions not
individuals. The real reason they wanted to do that was to keep power for
themselves.
Ms Nanette Milne, an Aberdeen councillor, said it was wrong to assume the
whole of Scotland was 'crying out' for constitutional change.
She said many people were afraid that devolution would create divisions
between Scotland's different regions. There was 'a real fear' of rule by
'red Clydesiders' and 'power-hungry Scottish socialists' if a separate
Scottish parliament was set up.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Latest figures stem pressure for rates rise: US inflation
and output both ease off in September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Washington
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation slowed in the US last month while industrial production flattened
off, helping to reduce investors' expectations of an early interest rate
increase from the Federal Reserve.
The consumer price index rose by 0.2 per cent last month after seasonal
adjustments, the smallest monthly increase for four months, the Department
of Labor said.
Over the last 12 months the index has risen by 3 per cent, without
adjustments, a fraction higher than August's inflation rate of 2.9 per cent.
The core inflation index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also
rose by 0.2 per cent in September and by 3 per cent over the last 12 months.
Industrial production, meanwhile, remained flat in September, according to
the Federal Reserve's own statistics, also published yesterday. Although
production of business equipment increased - with much of the advance in
computers and office equipment - output of consumer goods and construction
materials fell.
Flat output meant that US industry operated at 84.6 per cent of capacity in
September, the Fed said, edging down from August's rate of 84.8 per cent and
away from the 85 per cent level which some economists view as a
rule-of-thumb indicator of capacity constraints and inflationary pressures.
Both the inflation and industrial output statistics were somewhat lower than
Wall Street economists had predicted, and confirmed a widespread impression
that the US economy has slowed down from the breakneck pace of expansion it
recorded in the second quarter, when gross domestic product grew at an
annualised rate of 4.1 per cent, and that there are still no signs of rising
inflation at the consumer level.
The consensus forecast for third-quarter GDP collected this month by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators shows an annualised growth rate of 2.3 per cent.
But some economists still believe third-quarter growth will have exceeded
3.0 per cent, a rate which could still cause the Fed to worry that the
expansion is unsustainably fast.
Retail sales statistics published yesterday by the Commerce Department
showed somewhat faster growth than economists had predicted, advancing by
0.6 per cent in September, but this was not enough to alter the general
impression of slowdown conveyed by the inflation and industrial production
data.
With few significant economic statistics due to be published next week, most
Fed-watchers now expect no further increase in short-term interest rates
before the next meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which sets
Fed monetary policy, on November 15.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Hopes rise for nuclear deal with N Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hopes rose yesterday for a long-awaited breakthrough in the dispute between
the US and North Korea over Pyongang's nuclear programme.
South Korea's foreign minister, Mr Han Sung-joo, said in Seoul that
agreement could be announced within a few days.
But in Geneva - where the two countries have been discussing a pact under
which North Korea would accept full nuclear inspections in return for
improved ties with the US - officials said there were still key difficult
details to be agreed and any announcement was unlikely before next week.
Under the agreement, North Korea would abandon its nuclear programme by
replacing its dangerous graphite reactors with safer light-water models
supplied from South Korea, which would help finance the Dollars 4bn project.
The US and North Korea have apparently made rapid progress since Wednesday
after three weeks of largely futile talks.
Mr Han suggested that North Korea's recent flexibility might be linked to
possible assumption of power this weekend by Mr Kim Jong-il, the successor
and son of the late President Kim Il-sung.
Under the proposed pact, North Korea would accept international inspections
of its undeclared nuclear facilities, including two suspected nuclear waste
dumps, once the core equipment for the new light-water reactors are
delivered in two to three years.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) wants to examine the waste
facilities to determine whether Pyongyang reprocessed enough plutonium in
1989 for one or two nuclear bombs.
North Korea triggered the nuclear dispute in March 1993 by rejecting the
IAEA demand, and suspended its membership in the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty (NPT).
The US and North Korea will establish diplomatic liaison offices within six
months if Pyongyang returns to the NPT.
The US-designed light-water reactors to be supplied to North Korea produce
less weapons-grade plutonium than Pyongyang's current graphite models.
Energy-short North Korea will suspend construction of two 50MW and 200MW
reactors and stop operation of its 5MW reactor in return for alternative
electricity supplies, which will last until the light-water reactors are
completed in eight to 10 years.
North Korea would also keep in dry storage 8,000 plutonium-rich fuel rods
that were removed in May from its nuclear reactor. They would be taken to a
third country for reprocessing once the first of the two light-water reactor
units are completed.
Officials from the two countries were meeting yesterday to resolve several
issues, including linking the resumption of inter-Korean talks to the
proposed accord.
South Korea, worried about being isolated from the negotiations, wants talks
with North Korea by mid-January to discuss the implementation of their 1991
non-nuclear treaty.
Pyongyang is so far refusing the South Korean request, which is being
supported by the US.
Mr Lee Hong-koo, the South Korean deputy prime minister for unification,
indicated that his government would accept the agreement if inter-Korean
talks were guaranteed.
But he acknowledged that there had been disagreements between Seoul and
Washington over details of the proposed agreement, although 'there is no
difference on overall principles.'
South Korean officials are unhappy that full nuclear inspections will be
delayed for a few years since this could give North Korea additional time to
develop at least one nuclear bomb from the plutonium that it is suspected to
have already reprocessed.
At the Geneva discussions, US and North Korean experts were contining to
wrangle over final touches to their accord, according to a US official. Once
the wording was agreed, the pact would be referred back to the respective
governments, a process which could take several days.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Reluctant Iraqi citizens toe Saddam's line on borders:
Recognition goes against historic claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If President Saddam Hussein is ready to renounce Iraq's claim on Kuwait,
most Iraqis will of course agree with him.
'Whatever President Saddam Hussein says, we will follow his instructions,'
said Mr Radwan Khalaf Mohammed, a 60-year-old waiting for a taxi to his
Mosul home in Baghdad yesterday. 'If he wants us to recognise Kuwait, we
will be with him.'
But even in the streets of Baghdad, where moustachioed men sidle up and
listen closely to any exchanges with foreigners, some Iraqis were prepared
to say that, as far as they were concerned, Kuwait is, was and ever shall be
part of Iraq.
'Should there be borders between Iraq and Kuwait? No,' said a 26-year-old
theatrical director. 'We all know, from since we are kids we've known, that
Kuwait is part of Iraq.'
'I cannot stand to hear say that we are to recognise Kuwait, even my body
shakes,' said a 44-year-old shopkeeper, who was indeed shaking. 'My arm is
trembling when I hear this, because we have for years known that Kuwait is
an Iraqi country.'
In fact, Iraq has long maintained that Kuwait has always been Iraqi - from
Ottoman times. Iraqi historians have taught generations of Iraqi
schoolchildren that the emirate was part of the vilayet, or administrative
district, of Basra. Western and Kuwaiti historians contend the emir of
Kuwait enjoyed considerable freedom from Ottoman rule and that Iraq's claim
is poorly based.
While successive Iraqi rulers have held diplomatic ties with successions of
Kuwaiti counterparts - including, up to the summer of 1990, Mr Saddam and
Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti emir - Iraq sought to invade its southern
neighbour first in 1962, when a joint British-Arab force held the line, then
again, with a seven-month occupation and bloody consequences, in 1990.
If Mr Saddam unequivocally recognises Iraq's border with Kuwait, which for
the first time was formally demarcated by a UN commission after the Gulf
conflict, he would be the first Iraqi leader to do so.
Iraq has never been content with the loosely sketched British demarcation of
1922. Though this served as the roughly accepted line until the UN
demarcation, it relied on such imprecise markers as palm trees and low
rising rock formations in the featureless desert scrub.
Kuwait quietly ceded a strip of its northern coast to Iraqi control during
the Iran-Iraq war as a gesture of support for Baghdad, which used the land
to build a military hoverport at Umm Qasr, a facility now formally back in
Kuwait and housing the headquarters of the Unikom force which monitors the
present border.
Before the past week's border crisis, Unikom frequently reported shootings
across the desert line and, in January last year, incursions by Iraqis which
included the theft of a Silkworm missile stored in what used to be an Iraqi
military bunker.
Yesterday's declaration by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister,
that Iraq would now recognise the border and Kuwait's sovereignty with 'no
conditions' holds some promise of closing this chapter of Gulf border
belligerence.
But if Iraq's recognition suggests that the Kuwait invasion and subsequent
war - costing tens of thousands of Iraqi lives - was a mistake, few Iraqis
will risk saying so in public. Instead, they argue that Mr Saddam has
rightly decided to remove any further pretext for continued sanctions or
further bombardment of their cities.
News that Russian diplomacy and apparent Iraqi concessions might bring
relief from the increasingly bitter scourge of sanctions was greeted with
cautious relief, deep scepticism that America will allow this to happen, but
an unmistakably profound desire that it should be so.
'It will be a better life for me,' said a tea vendor in his 30s who said he
fought in the Gulf war. 'I will be able to get married, have a wife and
child and have a better life. Conditions are not for this now.'
Booming over the posh but increasingly impoverished Baghdad suburb of
Mansour, the preacher's voice after Friday prayers implored: 'Please help us
to bring our enemies to reason.'
That task has now been entrusted to the Russian foreign ministry and Mr
Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, who will take their diplomatic
package to the UN Security Council next week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In response to an article in the Financial Times on Tuesday, Mr Bruce
Millan, the European Union's regional affairs commissioner, issued a
statement saying there was 'no question' of the union blocking funds to
boost infrastructure investment in Greece. Referring to a series of roads
and other projects in Greece due to be financed through the union's
structural funds scheme, Mr Millan said: 'A small number of multi-regional
programmes still remain to be approved but this should not be interpreted as
a blockage by the (European) community of these programmes.' The
commissioner said officials at the Commission were discussing the projects
with the Greek government 'in a spirit of constructive dialogue' and were
'proceeding rapidly towards their finalisation'. He added: 'It is merely a
question of finding the most appropriate solutions to ensure their effective
implementation.'

Taiwan's central bank governor yesterday quashed calls to lift limits on
foreign investment in the country's stock market. Mr Liang Kuo-shu said:
'There is still room for foreign funds to enter the market, indicating no
urgency to raise the ceiling at moment.' A recent share payment default
crisis, which sparked a 14.7 per cent dive in share prices, has prompted
calls to increase the proportion of foreign investment in the market. Mr Day
Linin, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, called on the
central bank to raise the percentage of foreign investment to 10 per cent of
market capitalisation. Taiwan is one of the most restrictive equity markets
in Asia, with a ceiling on direct foreign investment in securities of
Dollars 7.5bn. But the central bank fears increased capital flows would make
it difficult to control the exchange rate and money supply.

Honda and Nissan are both considering buying diesel engines from European
car makers in an attempt to meet growing demand. Honda said that Peugeot was
among a number of candidates to supply diesel engines for its Civic model,
which is to replace the Concerto. The Japanese car maker is already selling
Concertos in Europe with Peugeot diesel engines. The Concertos are
manufactured for Honda by Rover. Honda does not make diesel engines of its
own and trying to develop one would be extremely costly. Honda denied that
it was in detailed negotiations with specific companies but confirmed that
Peugeot was among a number of possible candidates.
Nissan is also considering using European diesel engines in its Primera
cars. These are exported from Japan and currently have Japanese engines.
Because of the rise of the yen, it is expensive to export diesel engines
from Japan to Europe, Nissan said. 'Diesel engines will become more
widespread in Europe and if we decide that buying from another manufacturer
on an original equipment manufacturing basis is the best way to go, we will
consider it,' the company added. The interest both companies have shown in
buying diesel engines in Europe represents a marked step away from past
practice among Japanese car makers, which have considered it crucial to use
their own engines.

FT  15 OCT 94 / US rebuffs Russian mediation on Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON, BAGHDAD, ISTANBUL

<TEXT>
The US yesterday rebuffed Russia's attempts to mediate between Iraq and the
west and said it would continue to move more troops to Kuwait in response to
the Iraqi threat.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said any consideration of
lifting the economic sanctions against Iraq in exchange for Baghdad's
promise to recognise Kuwait would be 'dangerously misguided' just one week
after the build-up of Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border had 'again
plunged the world into crisis.'
And Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said just before he arrived
in Kuwait yesterday that Iraq had not pulled its troops far enough back and
warned that the US would take 'military action' if Iraq continued to
entrench its Republican Guard at Nasiriyah, less than 100 miles from Kuwait.
'If they're digging in, we still have problems ahead of us .. We are talking
about military action, but I won't go beyond that to describe what form of
military action,' Mr Perry said.
President Bill Clinton said yesterday at a White House ceremony to give
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti a send-off before he returns home
today that he had ordered the deployment of troops and equipment to the
region to continue.
'Let there be no mistake. The United States will not allow Iraq to threaten
its neighbours,' Mr Clinton said.
US officials have been dismissive of the joint statement from Iraq and
Russia after a meeting in Baghdad between Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
In it, Iraq said it was ready to recognise Kuwait's sovereignty and the
border mapped out by the United Nations if it received some assurance that
the UN economic sanctions would be eased. Russia promised, in exchange, to
support the lifting of a ban on Iraqi oil sales after a six-month test of
the UN's monitoring of the Iraqi weapons programme.
The US position remains that Iraq must comply unconditionally with the UN
resolutions before any easing of the sanctions can be considered.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, adopted a similar line,
insisting that the Iraqi statement was clearly inadequate.
'The statement is inadequate for two reasons,' he said. 'It appears to give
Saddam Hussein a reward for the provocative actions of the last 10 days.
That is clearly wrong. Even more important it does nothing to meet the
concern which I met from all the Gulf states and very strongly from the King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia, namely that they (the Iraqis) should not be allowed to
renew this threat when the American and British soldiers have gone home.
Unless something is done to prevent this then his mailed fist will still be
over Kuwait and her neighbours.'
Mr Hurd was speaking on the last stage of visit to the Middle East which has
taken in Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. He added:
'We need to find some way of preventing the threat coming again. Work is now
going on in New York and proceeding well. The Russians are involved in this.
We are close to having a draft resolution from the Security Council which
will begin to deal with that.'
Mr Kozyrev stressed yesterday that Iraq would recognise the border and
sovereignty of Kuwait with 'no conditions'. He added that keeping up
sanctions against Baghdad would be an act of 'vengeance' if Iraq continues
to comply with the UN weapons monitoring programme.
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, is expected to clarify Iraq's
position in New York next week, when he and Mr Kozyrev explain Russia's
proposals to the Security Council.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pangalos in poll vow to clean up Athens: Transport minister
turned mayoral candidate aims to show he has a common touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pink-faced and perspiring in unseasonably hot weather, Mr Theodoros
Pangalos, Greece's former minister for European affairs, tramped around the
city centre in a back-to-basics campaign to become mayor of Athens.
Mr Pangalos has pledged to get rid of much that lies in his path: mounds of
uncollected rubbish, motorcycles parked illegally in pedestrian zones and
the street stalls set up by immigrant vendors, often ethnic Greeks from
central Asia selling Chinese silk and smuggled caviar.
'The first priority is to clean up Athens, but in the right way. There's
been no attempt to reduce rubbish output or organise collection of
recyclable materials. The city's waste is still being dumped in quarries
without further treatment,' Mr Pangalos said.
Contrary to appearances, running for mayor on the governing Panhellenic
Socialist Movement ticket in Greece's municipal elections tomorrow is not a
demotion for Mr Pangalos. He showed no hesitation about giving up the
transport minister's job when asked by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to
head the socialists' campaign in the first serious test of their popularity
since returning to power in last October's general election.
Moreover, Mr Pangalos is already seen as the front-runner to succeed the
elderly and ailing Mr Papandreou as Pasok's leader, perhaps as early as next
May if the prime minister stands for the presidency.
'I'm treating this campaign as an experiment in politics. It's about
addressing people's real problems, having a city that works, not about
attracting votes along party or ideological lines,' Mr Pangalos said.
A stint as mayor would give Mr Pangalos a chance to demonstrate that he can
get things done, dispelling a lingering suspicion in Pasok, based as much on
his communist past and years as a university economics lecturer in Paris as
on his time at the foreign ministry, that he is too much of an intellectual
to rally the party.
But Mr Pangalos has demonstrated his willingness to cater to Pasok's
populist streak. As European affairs minister until last June, he made
headlines in the Athens newspapers with his outspoken criticism of Greece's
European union partners on Balkan issues or relations with Turkey.
True to form, he quickly dismissed his conservative opponent in the race for
mayor, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat, as 'a mediocre foreign
ministry employee'.
Mr Avramopoulos, a former foreign ministry spokesman, has had an
inauspicious start to his political career. He won a seat in parliament with
the opposition New Democracy at last autumn's election, only to lose it six
months later on a legal technicality.
However, a recent opinion poll showed Mr Avramopoulos narrowly ahead of Mr
Pangalos, with almost 20 per cent of voters still undecided. The left-wing
candidate for mayor, Mrs Maria Damanaki, the former leader of the
ex-communist Left Coalition party, was far behind in third place.
Mr Pangalos acknowledged he was unlikely to capture an outright majority
tomorrow. But he appears confident of defeating Mr Avramopoulos in a run-off
poll on October 24, with support from left-wing Athenian voters.
Athens has a population of 2.2m but most of its residents are not eligible
to vote in local elections. Registered voters number only 800,000, many of
whom have moved outside the city limits in order to escape high levels of
atmospheric pollution and noise.
The inner city is now home to a large immigrant population, including tens
of thousands of Albanians, Poles and a community of Moslems, mostly ethnic
Turks from north-eastern Greece for whom Mr Pangalos has promised to find a
site for a mosque. It would be the first built in Athens since Greece won
independence from the Ottoman empire early last century. The city hall
budget has grown from Dr42bn (Pounds 110m) to Dr70bn over four years, with
the launch of ambitious schemes to reduce atmospheric pollution by creating
more green areas and building a light tramway around the Acropolis and other
historic monuments.
Mr Pangalos plans to invest another Dr15bn yearly in projects aimed at
reducing levels of traffic in the city centre. Vehicle exhaust fumes have
been identified as the main source of the 'nefos', the pollution cloud that
envelops Athens in hot still weather.
Despite restrictions limiting the city's 1.1m private vehicles to
circulating on alternate weekdays, pollution shows few signs of diminishing.
Mr Pangalos said: 'Athens has a very negative image, both in Greece and
abroad. Making more space for people will help to improve it.' That, he
added, will mean extending pedestrian zones, building new car parks and
introducing a fleet of small buses to operate routes in the city centre.

<TEXT>
The European Union's move to expand from 12 to 16 members next year will be
put to a vital test tomorrow when Finns decide in a referendum whether to
join the Union.
Recent polls suggest the result will be a clear approval of membership,
despite the vocal opposition of the influential farmers' lobby. An opinion
poll yesterday showed 50 per cent of voters supporting membership, 28 per
cent against and 22 per cent undecided.
With Austria having already voted to join, a strong Finnish Yes would
reinforce the Yes campaigns in neighbouring Sweden and Norway, where
opposition to joining is much stronger. Referendums are due in Sweden on
November 13 and in Norway on November 28.
Opinion in Sweden is finely divided. Although Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the new
Social Democratic prime minister, is strongly pro-EU, two members of his
cabinet are prominent No campaigners, leaving the government unable to
present a united front. In Norway, polls show Yes votes in Finland and
Sweden are vital if opinion is to be swung in favour of membership.
The Yes camp in Finland is also anxious for a clear majority to ensure there
is no last-minute move to block membership in parliament, which has the
final say. EU membership requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority.
A decisive issue in neutral Finland is likely to be a widespread desire to
move the country under the political umbrella of the EU following the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, yesterday said Russia had signalled its
approval of Finland joining the EU. Finnish membership would make the
1,240km Finnish-Russian border the EU's first direct frontier with Russia.
Mr Aho said Russian leaders saw trade and commercial advantages in having
Finland in the EU.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Odessa's buses get privatisation on the road: Change in
Ukraine often starts at local level, bypassing politicians in Kiev
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sergei Mann used to produce movies at Odessa's renowned film studio. But it
stood idle for years, like many Ukrainian concerns. So he started a private
transport company this summer with the studio's ageing bus fleet, previously
reserved for Soviet film stars.
The local evening hot spot, Casino Richelieu, covered renovation costs with
advertising. Painted a bright green, the buses brought beachcombers from
Odessa's Bolshoi Fontane district to the Black Sea coast. Film Studio
Transport, the company, lost money the first week, then never looked back.
Disney characters and rubber beach ball promotions quickly brought customers
and profits.
'That was all garbage,' says a raspy Mr Mann, aged 54, pointing to the buses
on the studio lot. 'I wanted to use these old buses. And I'm not old, I
still want to do a lot.' Now he plans five more routes and seeks funding for
50 more buses.
With Ukraine only now bracing for nationwide reform, Odessa's pilot
municipal transport privatisation scheme proves that change often occurs at
the local level, bypassing unwilling politicians in Kiev. After less than a
year, a fifth of the bus routes in Odessa are in private hands.
The programme, already in place in 12 cities, will be expanded to 13 more
throughout Ukraine this autumn. It works simply. Routes are advertised and
owners picked by bidding. The US Agency for International Development,
underwriter of the scheme, provides start-up expenses and legal work. The
routes then pay for themselves.
'This is one of the few business opportunities where you can just walk in
and start,' said Mr Jeff Martin, the US agency's co-ordinator. He claimed
privatisation in the first five cities reduced government subsidies by
Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.8m), off an initial Dollars 900,000 investment, and
created up to 8,000 jobs for drivers, mechanics, and service supports such
as coffee bars near bus stops.
The vehicles usually come from such unlikely sources as collectives and
large state companies which no longer use the buses because of layoffs and
closures.
US Aid hopes to expand the programme to link 1,200 small, isolated Ukrainian
villages with private inter-city routes early next year. Privatisation also
may include other inefficient municipal services such as waste collection
and housing maintenance.
In Odessa, a sprawling coastal city of 1.2m built by Catherine the Great
just 200 years ago, the new choices relieve transport pressures for many who
lack cars and live far from the historic centre in large Soviet apartment
ghettos. Fares went up, but service improved. On one route that was deemed
unprofitable by the state bus company, three separate companies today
compete for the same customers.
Independent mini-vans soon started to shadow official routes to lure away
customers. Mr Anatoly Vitkovsky, who owns one of six private bus companies,
said regulations remain unclear. But he added that imitation is the best
form of flattery.
A former bus driver, who makes Dollars 100 a month - five times a
ministerial salary - Mr Vitkovsky explained that his friends at state
garages also see the benefits. Many now lease the vehicles and run routes as
freelances. Their daily take, he estimates, surged up from Dollars 3 to
Dollars 14.
Business is not painless. Rising competition, even talk of takeover attempts
and bankruptcy, have worsened Mr Vitkovsky's ulcer condition. The owners
lament that weak Ukrainian banks cannot finance new buses.
Often they face simple but serious problems such as fuel shortages. With
characteristic Odessan humour, Mr Mann deflects further queries: 'There is
an old saying: 'Ask me about something easier than business'.'
But Mr Vitkovsky has no regrets. 'Odessites used to joke: 'What is a bus
terminal?'' he says. 'A place people were told there will be no bus.' They
may no longer get it.

FT  15 OCT 94 / General strike paralyses Italian cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's big cities were paralysed yesterday by a four-hour general strike
called by the trade unions to protest against cuts in pension and welfare
benefits in the 1995 budget.
The stoppage was accompanied by over 80 demonstrations, which the organisers
said attracted 3m people including crowds of 200,000 in Florence, Milan and
Rome. Union organisers, combined with tight police security, ensured there
were no incidents.
The peaceful nature of the protest and the prospect of more strikes to come
last night looked likely to encourage the government to find a way of
resuming a dialogue with the unions. Both Mr Giuseppe Tartaella, the deputy
premier, and Mr Clemente Mastella, the labour minister, hinted at this.
The dialogue was broken off 2 1/2 weeks ago when the government decided to
go ahead with its plans to find L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) to reduce the 1995
budget deficit, largely through spending cuts.
The strike was called by the three main trade union confederations and had
been preceded by a series of rolling stoppages over the previous two weeks
in large factories. Similar general strikes were staged against the
austerity budgets prepared by the two previous governments.
But yesterday's stoppage was far more widespread and saw much bigger crowds
of demonstrators in all the big cities. Civil servants, who are also at
loggerheads with the government over a wage and work conditions contract,
stayed away all day, and public transport stoppages were staged at different
times in different parts of the country.
Though the demonstrations were well behaved, their tone was angry. The
demonstration banners were as much against the budget as against Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, in person.
Mr Berlusconi himself was absent in Moscow signing a new friendship treaty
with Russia. As a sign of changing times, Mr Berlusconi was the first
foreign head of government staying inside the Kremlin - while workers were
chanting anti-government slogans on the streets of Italy.
The unions' leadership still hopes to prevent the shake-up in Italy's
generous pay-as-you-go state pensions system hurting the weakest members.
Even before yesterday's strike, some members of the government were
concerned by the loss of popularity over handling of the pensions issue.
Mr Mastella, whose ministry is in the front line of the issue, has pledged
to remedy hardship cases and iron out anomalies. The populist Northern
League, one of Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, has also said it will
seek to soften the impact of the reform when the measures are discussed in
parliament. 'I hope that as of this evening we can restart the dialogue,' Mr
Mastella said in a radio interview.
In contrast, the treasury has warned that any extra cost caused by changes
in the pensions reform proposals would have to be made up elsewhere. The
budget proposals involve an acceleration in raising the retirement age to 65
for men and 60 for women, reducing the rate at which pension rights accrue,
raising the minimum period of contributions, and penalising early
retirement.

   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's central bank governor, Mr Yannis Boutos, resigned yesterday in a
political dispute over his sacking of the temporary commissioner in charge
of the loss-making Bank of Crete, Kerin Hope writes. He was replaced by Mr
Loukas Papademos, the deputy governor.
Mr Papademos said the change would not affect the bank's tight monetary
policy, aimed at cutting inflation from 11.9 per cent to single digits next
year. The bank's exchange rate policy, based on a 'hard drachma' which has
slipped only 6-7 per cent this year against other European currencies, will
also be maintained.
Mr Boutos, appointed governor 11 months ago by Socialist prime minister
Andreas Papandreou, said he resigned 'over a question of principle' but gave
no details. Banking sources said he was under pressure to reinstate the
commissioner, Mr Kostas Kalivianakis, who has close links with senior
Socialist officials.
The Bank of Crete was placed under central bank supervision in 1989
following a Dollars 200m (Pounds 126.5m) embezzlement scandal involving its
owner, Mr George Koskotas, now in jail for fraud.
The central bank planned to put Bank of Crete on sale this year. Informal
discussions had already taken place with ETEVA, a state-owned development
bank keen to expand into commercial banking. However, the sale was placed on
hold following the Bank of Crete's worsening performance under Mr
Kalivianakis.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Clinton facing Bosnia arms ban pressure
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US senators are stepping up their pressure on the Clinton administration to
lift the arms embargo on Bosnia in defiance of the UK, France and Russia,
its partners in the 'contact group' that has sought to bring about a peace
settlement in Bosnia.
The deadline set by the US for the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan
proposed by the contact group three months ago will expire today with no
sign of a change in their refusal to agree to the proposal, and US officials
are working towards a United Nations resolution that responds to this
refusal.
The UK, along with other countries that have troops at risk inside Bosnia,
has let the US know that it would veto any resolution that contained a firm
commitment to lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the former
Yugoslavia, which they and many senior officials in the US administration
believe would only make the war bloodier.
But 50 US senators, led by Senator Bob Dole, the Republican minority leader,
wrote this week to President Bill Clinton to warn him that they still insist
on the US proposing an immediate resolution to lift the arms embargo against
Bosnia.
The Bosnian government last month gave the US some breathing space by asking
that implementation of an end to the arms embargo should be delayed for six
months, though it still wants the resolution providing for this lifting to
be passed immediately.
The senators said, 'Some of our allies seem to be deliberately
misinterpreting this compromise, describing it as a request to defer any
action on the embargo for six months'.
'As supporters of Bosnia's right to self-defence, we believe that any
US-sponsored resolution that falls short of the Bosnian government's
compromise position - immediate action to lift, but implementation delayed
for six months - would not meet your commitment to Congress,' they wrote.
If a resolution were too firm and automatic in triggering a lifting of the
arms embargo, however, the UK, France and Russia have made it clear to
Washington that they would be prepared to use their Security Council vetoes.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Genscher summons up the old euphoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COTTBUS, BRANDENBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The audience was small but the applause was loud and long when Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher walked into the concert hall of Cottbus's music
conservatory in the eastern German state of Brandenburg.
With two days to go before a federal election that could see it wiped out,
the FDP had brought Mr Genscher - the veteran former foreign minister and
still one of the most popular German politicians - out of retirement to
recapture some of the support of the 1990 election, when the FDP won over 10
per cent of the vote in eastern Germany. The FDP has failed to win any seats
in the last seven German state elections.
Mr Genscher, who was born in east Germany, took one look at his audience,
many of them over 50, and then glanced at his notes. 'Don't forget what was
happening this time five years ago,' he said. 'Hungary had just let the east
Germans out to freedom. More east Germans were in the German embassy in
Prague.'
The audience was clearly transported back to those euphoric days. 'I am so
excited about listening to Mr Genscher,' said 67-year-old Mrs Olga Ziekart.
'He did so much for us east Germans back in 1989. He helped us get our
freedom. He helped us become united. But people forget very quickly.'
Mrs Ziekart, expelled from the former Czechoslovakia in 1945 because she was
a Sudeten German, said she had no doubt how she would vote tomorrow. 'The
first vote is for Helmut (Chancellor Kohl). The second for the FDP - because
of Genscher.'
Mr Genscher continued to tap in to the crowd's memory. 'I was sitting at my
desk on the morning of November 9 in 1989. That evening the wall was torn
down. We must not forget that event,' he said. And then, to more applause,
he said united Germany needed a new beginning. 'East and west Germans must
work together for a fresh start. We must have inner unity.'
Looking at Mr Jurgen Turk, the FDP's candidate for Cottbus, Mr Genscher
appealed to his audience to cast their two votes for the local man. If Mr
Turk wins, it will be a near miracle. The Social Democrats won a landslide
victory in last September's state elections and the FDP failed to enter
parliament. 'But the collapse of the Berlin Wall was a miracle as well,'
said Mrs Ziekart.

FT  15 OCT 94 / German opposition claims election result still open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) ranged its biggest guns in
front of the Bonn press yesterday, arguing that the outcome of tomorrow's
election was completely open, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, party leader, said it was time to modernise Germany,
technologically and environmentally. Mr Oskar Lafontaine, shadow finance
minister, warned voters of further tax increases if Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won a fourth term. And Mr Gerhard Schroder,
the state premier of Lower Saxony, carried on doing all he could to charm
industry, saying the SPD had to learn to think about production and not just
about sharing out the fruits of production.
All three did their best to look as relaxed as possible, even though a final
poll by the Allensbach institute shows the SPD on 35.5 per cent, up 0.6
points since Wednesday but 5.5 points behind the CDU on 41 per cent, with
its coalition partners the FDP on 7.5 per cent. The Greens are on 8 per
cent, and the PDS, the former communists, on 4.
Whether the party could ever have won the election once Mr Kohl's bandwagon
got rolling is questionable. Either way, Mr Scharping's performance has
lacked conviction. The party stumbled over the question of taxation. There
has also been confusion about the party's policy on motorway speed limits, a
matter of considerable importance to German voters.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Russians ask who to blame for rouble row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Even by Russia's remarkable standards, this has been a strange week. On
'Black Tuesday' the currency lost more than a fifth of its value. Two days
later it surged 20 per cent. By the end of the week, Russia had a new
finance minister, a gap at the head of the Central Bank, a full-blown
political row and a confused public. One can only pity the writer of the
briefing papers for the International Monetary Fund's mission, starting work
in Moscow next week.
The Moskovskaya Pravda newspaper's headline summed up the mood of the
country. 'There are two eternal Russian questions: Who is to blame? What to
do?' it said. Characteristically, President Boris Yeltsin had few doubts on
either score, sacking the acting finance minister, urging Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, to quit, and setting up a commission
 -including the repackaged KGB - to investigate the whole affair.
Many people have been blamed for Tuesday's currency stampede, including
speculators, communists, and western spies, although no-one can give a
convincing reason for the scale or speed of the fall. Well informed reform
supporters believe it reflected an attempt by conservative ministers to
tarnish reform. There may be something to this line but - like most Russian
conspiracy theories - it is ultimately unprovable. Besides, the Moscow
Interbank Currency Exchange (Micex) is a small market and prone to
volatility. Speculation can easily assume a momentum of its own.
It is simpler, though, to see why the rouble came under heavy selling
pressure in previous weeks: the lowering of interest rates, the seasonal
increase in credits to the state sector and the rise in inflation from 4 per
cent a month in August to almost 8 in September.
The government's critics - most prominently, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former
finance minister - claimed the rouble's fall was the natural consequence of
this monetary loosening. 'If the government wants to know why the rouble
fell they only have to look in the mirror,' said one currency trader.
This demonstration of the market's power may have created a climate for
change and the government appears set to take a decisive step forward - or
back. Indecision could be dangerous. Russian economists predict inflation
may rise to 15 per cent in October, partly as a result of the currency
moves, putting further pressure on the rouble. Currency traders suggest the
Central Bank has been left with slender reserves with which to defend
itself.
The government has drawn up a tough budget for 1995, forecasting a fall in
inflation to 1 per cent a month by the year-end. It may press the IMF to
back a strong stabilisation plan.
Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor and former adviser to the
Russian government, believes it is not too late to make the rouble a stable
currency so long as it is backed by an IMF stabilisation fund. 'The costs of
not doing so could be catastrophic if Russia falls prey to monetary panic
and hyperinflation. But the first test is whether the Russians themselves
are prepared to live by the rules rather than the often reckless discretion
of powerful political figures,' he says.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Major promises time of stability: Prime minister rebuffs
calls for rightward shift in Tory party's direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major staked the Conservatives' claim to the centre ground of
British politics yesterday as he used his closing address to the Tory
conference in Bournemouth to rebuff calls for a rightward shift in the
party's direction.
In a speech defining the terms in which he intends to confront Mr Tony
Blair's Labour party, the prime minister promised a sustained economic
recovery, an end to upheavals in the welfare state and a strong but
pragmatic approach to Europe.
Basing his hopes of political revival firmly on an economy offering steady
growth and low inflation, he evoked a pledge made in 1954 by the then Tory
chancellor Mr RA Butler to double Britain's living standards within 25
years.
Mr Butler's much derided ambition had been met, he said. The Tories offered
the opportunity to repeat the achievement over the next 25 years.
Mr Major, who gave a hint of tax cuts before the next election, signalled
that he would make defence of the British Union - symbolised by his
opposition to devolution in Scotland and Wales - one of the main platforms
on which the government would fight the next general election.
In a confident if unspectacular performance, he left no doubt that he
intended to spend the two years or more before that election in rebuilding
the government's reputation for competence rather than on embarking on
radical new reforms.
Ending a conference which had been unsettled by ideological battles over
Europe and attempts by the party's right wing to dictate the political
agenda, Mr Major declared: 'Change for the sake of change should never
appeal to any Conservative. In a world of bewildering change this party must
stand for continuity and stability, for home and health.'
To reinforce the message of consolidation he coupled a commitment to a
large-scale extension of nursery education and to compulsory sport in
schools with a pledge that there would be no more significant reforms over
the next five years.
He offered a similar promise to the chiefs of the armed forces, saying the
huge upheavals in their services were at an end. Responding to Labour
charges of 'creeping privatisation' in the National Health Service, he
insisted the Conservatives would never 'while I live and breathe' take away
the security offered by free health care.
The consolidatory tone cast doubt on plans to privatise the Post Office,
which Mr Major did not mention. But Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, intends to continue to fight for the sell-off.
Mr Major's speech, which aides said he had written largely himself, included
only a fleeting reference to the issue which overshadowed much of the
conference - Europe. But he made clear that Euro-sceptics would not push him
into into abandoning his strategy of keeping Britain within a multi-speed,
multi-tiered European Union.
There was no direct mention of Mr Blair, but the prime minister accused
Labour of stealing the Conservatives' rhetoric while sticking to destructive
economic policies and promoting the 'politics of envy'. He said: 'Buying
Tory policies from Labour is like buying a Rolex on the street corner. It
may bear the name, but you know it's not real.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Russian central bank chief offers to quit over rouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of Russia's central bank offered his resignation in a letter to
President Boris Yeltsin, at the end of a turbulent week in Russian currency
markets.
Mr Yeltsin signed a decree formally relieving Mr Boris Gerashchenko of his
post. The state Duma (lower house of parliament) had been due to vote on an
earlier presidential request to remove Mr Gerashchenko next Wednesday, and
there was confusion following Mr Yeltsin's decree on whether it would still
be debated.
The news was greeted by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former reformist finance
minister, who wants Mr Gerashchenko's job, with the comment: 'There's
evidently still a God in heaven.'
The rouble, which fell heavily early in the week, strengthened further
yesterday after a recovery on Thursday, rising 6 points to end the day at
2,988 to the dollar. However, the market remained jumpy: Mr Igor Doronin,
the marketing adviser to the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, said the
central bank had deliberately run the currency down this week and warned
that a further crash could destroy the exchange.
Mr Fyodorov's delight at the offered resignation of his long-time opponent
contrasted with statements from Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the Russia's
Choice group, who said Mr Gerashchenko was 'right to take responsibility on
himself', and Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko group, who said
that he had acted 'like a real man'.
The candidates for Mr Gerashchenko's chair would include Mr Fyodorov, Mr
Dmitri Tulin, a bank deputy chairman with a good reputation with western
banks, and Ms Tatyana Paramanova, also a deputy chairman, noted for refusing
credits.
The move comes as the government prepares for talks with the International
Monetary Fund, whose team arrives today. The talks centre on a Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.5bn) fund to stabilise the currency, and the IMF will press for
detailed and closely monitored monetary and fiscal dealings.
It does not intend to support a budget for 1995 unless the government's aims
include reducing inflation to about 3 per cent or lower a month, and
achieving a budget deficit of about 5 per cent of gross national product
next year - compared with a present level of about 11 per cent.
Mr Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and former Russian government adviser, said
yesterday that 'whatever happened this week, the basic reason is that the
government has not put in place clear rules of the game - and so the power
of a few insiders to stop reform is still too great'.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Israeli soldier killed in failed rescue mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A kidnapped Israeli soldier, three of his Islamic extremist captors and one
would-be rescuer were killed last night in a failed rescue mission in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The kidnappers shot their hostage while he was bound, the Israelis said.
The bloody end to Israel's kidnap crisis - which began six days ago when
Hamas extremists seized 19-year-old Corporal Nachshon Waxman - leaves the
Middle East peace process in doubt, and overshadowed the award of the Nobel
peace prize yesterday to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, Mr Yassir
Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and Mr Shimon
Peres, Israeli foreign minister.
Israeli officials said a crack army unit had stormed the house where Cpl
Waxman was being held in a village between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the West
Bank commercial centre.
The raid happened just hours after Hamas had extended by 24 hours
yesterday's deadline to kill Cpl Waxman unless the Israeli government
released 200 Palestinian prisoners including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
group's spiritual leader.
The shootings will widen the gulf between Hamas, which opposes peace with
Israel and wants to destroy the Jewish state, and the Israeli and
Palestinian officials seeking to consolidate their fragile peace process.
Israel suspended peace talks after the kidnapping and told Mr Arafat he
would have to choose between dealing with Hamas and peace with Israel.
Mr Arafat made strenuous efforts to secure the release of Cpl Waxman,
rounding up more than 200 Hamas activists in Gaza and seeking to negotiate
the soldier's release.
As Cpl Waxman was found in the West Bank area still controlled by the
Israeli army and not, as Mr Rabin had earlier insisted, in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza, Mr Arafat will be able to argue that once he
takes over all the West Bank from Israel he will be able to police Hamas
better.
But many senior Israeli officials believe Mr Arafat has yet to take the
decisions necessary to deal with Hamas. They will use last night's tragedy
to pile pressure on Mr Rabin to force Mr Arafat into a head-on confrontation
with Hamas.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, who met Mr Arafat in Egypt
yesterday, told the PLO leader to 'confront the reign of terror imposed by
Hamas'.
Hamas, outraged at the wide scale arrests of its activists, has also
demanded that Mr Arafat choose - between Hamas and the peace process. In a
thinly veiled threat of internal Palestinian conflict Mr Mahmoud Zohar, a
leading Hamas activist in Gaza, warned that Mr Arafat would 'suffer the
consequences' if he continued his clampdown.
Mr Arafat's aides have cautioned against making demands for an all-out
confrontation with Hamas, saying the peace deal is still too fragile to
guarantee that the pro-peace forces would win. They warn that such a
confrontation could erupt into civil war.

FT  15 OCT 94 / MP calls for tapes on Thatcher allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The head of the House of Commons committee that investigated the
controversial Al Yamamah defence contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia
yesterday said tape recordings allegedly implicating Mr Mark Thatcher should
be released.
The call by Mr Robert Sheldon of the Public Accounts Committee for
parliament to hear the tapes of conversations between arms dealers and
agents of the Saudi royal family follows claims that Lady Thatcher's son
received Pounds 12m in commission from the deal.
A demand for a fresh inquiry into the deal is likely to emerge from a
meeting next Wednesday of Mr Sheldon's committee.
Last weekend The Sunday Times newspaper published extracts from alleged
transcripts of bugged telephone conversations, together with corroborating
evidence from sources close to the contract negotiations.
The transcripts suggest that Mr Thatcher was part of a team of middlemen who
earned Pounds 240m in commissions from the deal.
Mr John Witherow, Sunday Times acting editor, said last night that although
the newspaper did not have the tapes, or know of their whereabouts, it had
full translations of transcripts.
Mr Sheldon said yesterday a parliamentary inquiry into the allegations would
be discussed next week. But he is also considering calling on the
government's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, to undertake a
fresh examination of Al Yamamah.
The Pounds 20bn arms deal was signed in 1986 as a government-to-government
agreement, with British Aerospace named as the main contractor.
Mr Sheldon was instrumental in deciding that a 1992 NAO report was not
published on grounds of national security.
He said the report showed no evidence of corruption and made no mention of
Mr Thatcher.
Mr Thatcher has remained silent publicly since last weekend's allegations.
But his mother earlier this week once again denied any impropriety in Al
Yamamah, which she helped to win while prime minister.
However, a senior French defence executive said yesterday The Sunday Times
allegations confirmed reports circulating among rival contractors during the
initial bidding process.
Mr John Wyatt, director of Search Training International, a British security
company which won a contract under the package, said: 'There was an agreed
figure (for the package) under which all military items were subsequently
drawn down. I think this made it difficult to check the authorisation of the
payments. I am not surprised it was open to misuse.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss authorities said yesterday that the 'guru' of the Order of the
Solar Temple, Luc Jouret, wanted for murder since the discovery of the
bodies of 53 followers in Switzerland and Canada last week, died with his
disciples. Investigating judge Jean-Pascal Jaquemet, heading the inquiry
into 25 deaths last week in the Alpine village of Granges-sur-Salvan, said
Jouret's body had been formally identified among the dead. The deaths of
Joseph Di Mambro, the dictatorial 'pope' of the order, and Camille Pilet,
the Swiss businessman who acted as the sect's treasurer, were confirmed by
police earlier this week. In recent days, speculation was rife that Jouret
had set up his fellow cult members and escaped with the sect's considerable
financial assets. Jouret was a Belgian-born 46-year-old homeopathic doctor
whose charisma made him the cult's chief recruiter. An international arrest
warrant for murder and arson was issued for him after the deaths were
discovered last Wednesday. Twenty-five cult members, including Jouret, died
in Granges and 23 others were found dead in the village of Cheiry, 160km to
the north. Five more corpses were found in a community north of the Canadian
city of Montreal.

FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sellers of ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading chemicals stock ICI was pushed down by selling that followed an
international conference call held by US bank Goldman Sachs for around 60
leading UK, US and European investors.
The house argued that US commodity prices were beginning to soften and, as
the most expensively rated company among its US and continental European
peers, ICI would be vulnerable to a downturn. Shares in the company were off
9 at worst and, by the close of trading, recorded a net fall of 3 1/2 to 810
1/2 p with 5m traded.
GEC stepped into the bid saga at VSEL, declaring itself a 'bona fide
potential offerer' and raising the temperature, if not the immediate stakes,
in what could become a bidding auction for the submarines group.
VSEL put on 10 to 1,320p while British Aerospace, which has an agreed 1,280p
share offer on the table, shed 4 to 467p. GEC was the most actively traded
of the trio, gaining 4 to 300p in 7.5m trades.
Royal Insurance was the heaviest traded insurance stock, with turnover of
9.8m the highest since mid-August, and said to have reflected hefty
switching out of one of Royal's convertible stocks and into the ordinary
shares. The latter closed 4 higher at 299p.
In banks, big buying by James Capel lifted HSBC to 745p before a close of
737p, a net gain of 11, while better than expected third-quarter results
from NatWest Bancorp helped NatWest shares jump 13 to 510p. Barclays rose 10
to 573p after the bank dismissed recent market hints of heavy losses on its
proprietary trading books.
Disappointment following interim figures from Alexandra Workwear saw shares
in the work clothes supplier tumble 23 to 161p.
Elsewhere in the sector Dewhirst, the clothing and toiletries group, fell 3
to 124p as one house took on a line of 1.7m shares at 123p and sold them at
122 1/4 p.
Eurotunnel fell 18 to 245p - almost 7 per cent - following a UK press report
ahead of Monday's trading report that the group might struggle to meet its
profit forecasts, thereby unsettling its supporting banks.
Most dealers firmly suspected that Monday's results statement would contain
bad news. 'It is never wrong to panic where Eurotunnel is concerned,' said
one analyst yesterday.
Lonrho tumbled in heavy trading as rumours of financial difficulties within
the private financial empire of joint chief executive Mr Dieter Bock sent
the shares into a nose-dive.
The rumours centred on German holding company Advanta Management and led to
speculation in London that Mr Bock might be forced to dispose of part of his
near 19 per cent shareholding in Lonrho. The speculation was denied by the
German company, which described talk of a 'liquidity blockage' as absurd.
Lonrho shares closed 12 lower at 131 1/2 p with 12.9m traded.
The latest traffic figures from airports group BAA pleased the market,
pushing the shares up 10 to 517p on turnover of 4.7m as Sep-tember traffic
grew by 8.3 per cent whereas most analysts were going for less than 6 per
cent.
BAT Industries recovered 9 to 457p. The tobacco and insurance conglomerate
announced it had secured a majority shareholding in Russia's Java tobacco
factory in return for an agreement to pump Dollars 70m into the company. The
three-year investment programme will raise Java's production rate from 14bn
cigarettes a year to 20bn.
Hanson, which has been restrained recently by heavy US dealing, rose 6 1/2
to 236p on turnover of 11m.
Meanwhile, traded options in the company saw the equivalent of a further 5m
shares changing hands.

FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of stiffer competition in the cola market sent confectionery
and soft drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes tumbling 12 to 438p, as 9.3m shares
were traded, the highest daily total for four years.
Confirmation that Tesco is to have exclusive rights to sell Mr Richard
Branson's Virgin Cola for at least six months, appeared to be the trigger
for the latest slide in the stock. The shares fell on Wednesday after an
announcement that Virgin group is to launch its own brand cola.
Market watchers first thought the new product, whose syrup is to be made by
Cott Corporation of Canada, would be distributed largely through independent
retailers, thus posing less threat to Cadbury's soft drinks market share.
A joint venture between Cadbury and Coca-Cola bottles, cans and distributes
Coca-Cola and Cadbury beverages brands in the UK. Analysts said the deal
with Tesco was likely to give Virgin its target market share of around 7 per
cent of the UK retail market.
Miss Arabella Cecil, at Credit Lyonnais, said: 'If the Virgin cola meets Mr
Branson's volume targets, Cott Corporation's products will achieve a 20 per
cent market share in the UK.' Shares in Tesco hardened 2 1/2 to 239 1/2 p.

FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telecoms attract buyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The telecoms stocks, in the forefront of the market's upsurge of recent
days, continued to make good progress yesterday with Cable and Wireless
leading the pack higher again, and with buying stimulated by a 40-page buy
note published by Hoare Govett. C &amp; W rose 5 more to 426p on turnover of
10m.
Hoare described C &amp; W shares as having 'further to go' and highlighted its
500p price target for the shares.
The broker said C &amp; W's entire market capitalisation is now less than the
value of its holdings in HK Telecom and in 23 cellular groups around the
world, leaving Mercury and the rest in the price for free.
Hoare said that if floated independently these operations would be worth
Pounds 3.6bn, equivalent to the value of a middle-ranking FT-SE 100 company.
The prospects of a potential bid for the group was also mentioned by Hoare.
He said that eight of the world's top 10 telecoms companies are involved in
important deals.
The broker cited AT &amp; T, US West, Pacific Telses and Hutchison as potential
bidders/partners for C &amp; W: 'It is even conceivable that BT could buy C &amp; W
for its presence in the far east and then sell off Mercury.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures produced another strong advance, applying clear upward
pressure to the cash market throughout a busy afternoon, writes Jeffrey
Brown.
The market drifted through most of the morning session with few houses
prepared to take the lead. But the moment the latest US inflation
figures bounced on to the screens, it was every man for himself.
The FT-SE 100 December contract shot ahead with the premium to cash equities
widening again to 30 points. At the official 4:10pm close, the contract was
55 points higher at 3,169 after touching a high for the day of 3,179.
At this level the premium to the cash market was 27.1 points with the fair
value premium standing at around 13 points.
Heavily concentrated into the afternoon session, trading volume was heavy at
16,146 contracts, against less than 14,000 at the official close on
Wednesday.
Traded option volume also moved up strongly, rising to 58,530 lots from
48,750 a day earlier. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE trading accounted for 26,600
lots.
Hanson was by far the busiest individual stock option, turning over 5,103
lots - the highest volume for a single option for some weeks. Guinness and
Cable and Wireless were also actively traded.

FT  14 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US price statistics drive share
prices higher - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK stock market trading cautiously in the first half of yesterday's
session exploded with confidence after an unexpected fall in US producer
price figures in September triggered a sharp rise on Wall Street and in
global bond markets.
After showing little change at mid-session, the FT-SE 100 share index jumped
by more than 50 points on the US data, before closing a net 41.4 points up
at 3,141.9. Trading volume jumped by nearly 12 per cent.
The market's optimistic mood was helped by a buoyant speech at the
Conservative Party Conference from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of
the exchequer, in which he reiterated the government's firm stance against
inflation. The Bundesbank's decision to leave German rates unchanged was no
surprise but buttressed confidence that upward pressures on world rates are
slackening.
The fall of 0.5 per cent in US September producer prices, and a gain of 0.1
per cent in the core rate, reduced the threat of an early tightening in
Federal Reserve credit policy and lends support to confidence that the
recovery in the US economy can be achieved without increasing inflationary
pressures.
However, some analysts warned that today brings another round of important
statistics on the US economy, including the consumer price index, industrial
production and capacity utilisation numbers. These could still present a
challenge to optimistic views on US economic recovery and interest rate
prospects.
In the early part of the session, share prices were easier until stock index
futures opened firmly. Even then, however, share prices trod water, with
investors appearing unwilling to drive the recovery in the stock market any
further. Wednesday evening saw an apparent slackening in the pace of the
stock market upswing, although traders showed unwillingness to take profits.
Active features included the defence sector, where disclosure that GEC had
declared interest in the VSEL bid situation alerted investors. The market
appeared unsure whether GEC would bid - its shares advanced yesterday - and
VSEL, although still above the British Aerospace terms, made only a modest
response to the news.
But the gain on the FT-SE 100 Index jumped from 3 points to 23 points within
the hour which included announcement of the US price data. The chief impetus
came from bond markets but the December contract on the Footsie also led the
way ahead, moving above 3,178 at the day's peak and showing a good premium
against the underlying stock market.
The influence of the stock index future contract implied a focus on the
blue-chip Footsie 100 stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 index, taking in a range of
second line issues, gained only 21.3 points for a close of 3,556.6. Trading
in non-Footsie stocks made up around 55 per cent of total business
yesterday.
Although gains were fairly evenly spread across the range of the market, it
was the US-influenced stocks which stood out at the close of trading in
London, when the Dow Industrial Average was ahead by 38 points in early
trading.
The FT-SE 100 share index has risen by just over 185 points since its return
to the bull tack a week ago. This is a heartening development for analysts
who had predicted that by the year-end, the Footsie would be in the 3,400
plus range.
Market traders now hope that subdued inflationary pressures will enable base
rates to remain at their present levels for the rest of the year, while
economic recovery shows through more clearly, bringing higher earnings and
dividend payouts from leading British companies.

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides as new figures
are awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices powered higher yesterday morning on a surprisingly
favourable reading on inflation, but the rally fizzled out during the
afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 14.80 better at 3,889.95,
about 40 points lower than its best level of the session. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 2.32 at 467.79.
On the NYSE, activity was brisk, with 337m shares traded by the close.
Investors were even more restrained in the other markets. The Nasdaq
composite was up 0.89 at 767.89, and the American SE composite 0.07 ahead at
458.57.
Within 10 minutes of the opening the Dow industrials had surged by more than
50 points, triggering the NYSE's 'uptick' restrictions on programme-guided
buying for the second time this week.
Soon afterwards, the index began to recede, slowly at first, but at more
determined pace towards the final bell.
The initial impetus higher was the Labor Department's announcement of a 0.5
per cent decline in September producer prices. Economists had expected a
slight 0.1 per cent gain.
The slump in prices reinforced the growing sense that the economy was not
accelerating fast enough to warrant an immediate tightening of monetary
policy. Bond prices leapt on the news and held on to most of their gains.
In equities, the apparent shift in sentiment late in the day suggested
investors remained cautious ahead of today's data on consumer prices, retail
sales and industrial production.
Among individual issues, paper and pulp stocks rebounded after two days of
weakness. International Paper recovered Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 3/4 after
news of a lacklustre third-quarter performance pulled its share price down
earlier in the week. Georgia-Pacific added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 77 1/2
and Champion International was marked up Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 5/8 . Both
posted better-than-expected earnings. Though most of the earnings news was
strong, there were some disappointments. Perhaps the biggest was
Bausch&amp;Lomb, down Dollars 4 1/2 at Dollars 34 1/8 . Investors wiped 11 per
cent off the share valuation of the optics company after it revealed net
income of 13 cents a share, against 93 cents a year ago.
In banking, JP Morgan added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 61 5/8 after announcing
a profit level which slightly exceeded expectations. Bank of New York, which
handily beat the forecasts, gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 3/4 .
CBS back pedalled for the second day running. The day after the media group
posted poor results, its share price dropped a further Dollars 20 1/2 to
Dollars 309 1/2, thanks in part to a downgrading by Prudential Securities.
The Nasdaq managed to stay in positive territory in spite of a Dollars 1
decline in Apple Computer to Dollars 41 1/8. Biogen was down Dollars 2 3/8
at Dollars 45 5/8.
But Altera, an integrated circuit maker, jumped 5 5/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 on
upgradings by two Wall Street securities houses.

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Market activity declines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Declines in activity in Europe's two biggest equity markets, Germany and the
UK, brought total turnover at the eight bourses measured by NatWest
Securities down by 3.5 per cent in September after the substantial, 10.7 per
cent rise in August.
However, says Mr James Cornish at NatWest, the fall was by no means uniform;
five of the eight saw turnover gains although share prices fell overall with
the FT-Acturaries Europe index down 6.4 per cent, after the July/August
summer rally which took them 7.8 per cent higher.
Mr Cornish adds that international investors returned after a summer lull,
with turnover in European stocks traded on Seaq International in London
rising to a 'normal' 16.2 per cent of that in continental domestic markets
from 15.2 per cent in the month before.
The star performers in volume terms last month were: France, where turnover
rose 15.8 per cent although the share price index dropped 8.6 per cent;
Italy, with a 12.5 per cent gain after a 15.9 per cent August drop -
reflecting hopes that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, was
getting his political act together; Spain, where a rise of 11.9 per cent in
Madrid volumes contrasted with a drop of 16.4 per cent via the Spanish Seaq
International market in London; and Belgium, which saw business up 10.7 per
cent on top of a 29.4 per cent rise in August.

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses forget domestic
concerns after US data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US PPI figures, taking Treasuries up by over a point in the New York
morning, did their best to wipe domestic concerns off the European agenda
yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. By and large, they succeeded,
but individual bourses and share prices varied the effect.
FRANKFURT moved from near-stasis at the close of the official session, with
the Dax index up 5.06 at 2,082.63, to elation in the post-bourse where the
Ibis-indicated Dax closed 35.40 higher at 2,108.08.
Turnover rose from DM7.1bn to DM8bn. Outstanding performance came from
stocks depressed or ignored until recently. Allianz, pulled back following
its acquisition of three Swiss Re units by fears of a rights issue, which it
denied, rose DM99, or 4.4 per cent, to DM2,363 by the post-bourse close.
Similarly, Schering parleyed its relief after Tuesday's Biogen news from San
Francisco into a further DM48 gain at DM1,008, up DM110 or 12.2 per cent, in
three days, while the ever-volatile Metallgesellschaft recovered another DM7
to DM166.
The recovery theme extended to Kardstadt, the department store group.
Retailers have been depressed this year on the lack of impetus in German
consumer spending, said Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, but
Karstadt rose DM18 to DM630 on hopes that the ruling conservative/liberal
coalition will win Sunday's elections.
PARIS was pleased with the US data, which was reflected in a gain on the
CAC-40 index of 37.54, or nearly 2 per cent, to 1,955.68.
France has attracted strong recommendations this week from both Smith New
Court Europe and James Capel. Capel noted that 'at a time when cyclicals are
running into some profit-taking, the French market, whose constituents are
less exposed to the cycle, has more safe havens'.
Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch highlighted the banking sector as having scope for
growth, and said that it believed there was a 25 per cent plus upside in
many financials on a two year view. Merrill said that it had a preference
for CLF and CCF, followed by Paribas and BNP, while it was neutral on
Societe Generale, Suez and Bancaire. Financials were strong yesterday with
CLF up FFr5.40 to FFr394.30 and CCF up FFr6.30 at FFr223.90.
Eurotunnel, one of the market's most volatile stocks, was among the day's
biggest losers, off 6 per cent at FFr20.55, after the group said that it
would be unable to meet its 1994 business targets.
ZURICH came alive after the release of the US data. The SMI index rose 30.6
or 1.2 per cent to 2,593.3, derivatives-related buying helping during the
afternoon after the index broke through the 2,580 level.
Banks were higher with UBS bearers gaining SFr19 to SFr1,259 as the bank
continued to buy its own stock. Credit Suisse rose SFr13 to SFr549, partly
as a result of continued switching from UBS.
Insurers were strong with Zurich Insurance adding SFr15 to SFr1,205 and
Swiss Re putting on SFr16 to SFr730.
Among chemicals, Sandoz gained SFr6 to SFr671 and Roche certificates SFr60
to SFr5,940. Speculative activity continued to spur the sector's smaller
issues, taking Berner SFr20 higher to SFr1,510.
AMSTERDAM went with the rising trend throughout the continent, which left
the AEX index 5.01 higher at 407.31.
JP Morgan recommended an underweight position on the market on a long-term
view, mainly because of the high exposure of companies to the US, where some
30 per cent of profits are derived. 'The only offset would be if it was
thought a rise in short-term rates could lead to a sharp rise in the US
dollar, historically positive for the market,' the broker said.
MILAN reversed early falls, in line with other bourses, as investors brought
forward account-end position-squaring ahead of today's general strike which,
it was feared, could close many banks.
The Comit index registered a 9.36 fall to 630.32, reflecting early weakness
as political and budgetary concerns continued to cast shadows. However, the
real-time Mibtel index picked up from a low of 9,983 to finish 107, or 1.1
per cent ahead, at 10,220.
Kleinwort Benson said that although political instability was becoming
increasingly structural, it was not yet in anyone's interests for the
government to fall. In view of this and the strong underlying fundamentals,
the market was likely to rebound in coming weeks.
Pirelli was L45 higher at L2,280 on short covering and Olivetti rose L30 to
L1,927.
MADRID, an underperformer this year, out did other bourses in the extent of
yesterday's recovery with the general index up 7.43, or 2.5 per cent, at
303.18. Dealers noted a very strong performance from the banking sector, not
only on the US data but also on the market's anticipation that Spain's own
CPI figures today will be similarly well received.
STOCKHOLM was broadly higher in heavy trading with much of its 1.9 per cent
advance coming during the second half of the session. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose 26.90 to 1,452.10.
Attention again focused on Ericsson Bs which closed SKr4.5 higher at SKr422,
for a four day rise of 8.2 per cent in response to the strong interim
earnings report from Motorola.

<TEXT>
Gold shares were under pressure from a falling bullion price but other
issues posted strong gains in late afternoon trading, taking their lead from
Wall Street's strong performance. The overall index collected 53 to 5,612,
industrials rose 62 to 6,324 and golds finished 19 ahead at 2,301, off a
high of 2,309.
Dealers noted that the slightly softer financial rand had given shares
leeway to make ground in rand terms after recent pressure.

Sappi bounced as buying returned after its purchase for Dollars 1.6bn
earlier in the week of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren. Sappi rose R5 or
8.8 per cent to R62.

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrageurs lift Nikkei
as Shanghai fears witch-hunt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Share prices gained ground on arbitrage buying and the Nikkei index closed
marginally higher, in spite of profit-taking by corporate investors, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 59.11 to 20,148.83 after a low of 20,042.81 in the morning
session and a high of 20,176.64 in the late afternoon. Heavy index-linked
selling by financial institutions and profit-taking by corporations
depressed prices in the morning, but the index saw later support from
arbitrageurs, overseas investors and some individuals.
Traders said that some of the increased activity was linked to the October
options settlement today. However, the yen's rise against the dollar had
little impact on investor confidence.
Volume rose above 300m shares for the first time since September 22,
totalling 350m against 287m. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 5.56 to 1,606.16 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.96 to 294.18.
Advances led losses by 631 to 353, with 182 issues remaining unchanged.
In London ,the ISE/Nikkei 50 index climbed 2.25 to 1,324.13.
In spite of the rise in activity, domestic institutions remained cautious.
However, foreign investors continued to buy steels and chemicals. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y395 and Kawasaki Steel
added Y6 to Y452. Mitsubishi Chemical gained Y9 to Y576.
Mitsubishi Bank fell Y50 to Y2,570 following the rise on Wednesday after its
announcement that it was taking a large stake in Nippon Trust Bank. Leading
credit rating agencies announced that they would review Mitsubishi's rating
for a possible downgrading of its long-term debts.
Other banks were higher, with Industrial Bank of Japan up Y10 to Y3,070 and
Sakura Bank adding Y10 to Y1,320.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose for the sixth consecutive day supported by
small-capital issues backed by good earnings prospects. The index rose
145.50 to 22,431.69.
Roundup
A mixed day was seen by the region's markets. Hong Kong and Bombay were
closed for public holidays.
SEOUL, which is considering allowing foreign companies to list their shares,
was higher for the fourth straight day on across-the-board buying which took
the composite index 6.88 ahead to another record close of 1,096.54.
Some blue chips, however, posted losses on heavy selling by institutional
investors, worried that an overheated rally may cause the government to
implement cooling measures.
TAIPEI improved a further 2 per cent, led by a strong electronics sector,
but brokers said that they expected a consolidation in the short term.
The weighted index rose 130.61 to 6,626.39 in turnover of TDollars 84.97bn.
Financial stocks reversed early losses to rise on last-minute buying: ICBC
gained TDollars 1 to TDollars 97.
Blue-chip electronics led the gains, with the computer makers, Acer and ADI
up by the 7 per cent limit to TDollars 97 and TDollars 43.4.
In contrast, SHANGHAI's A share index fell 11.1 per cent amid fears that an
investigation into the source of last week's rumours about the death of Deng
Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, could become a witch-hunt. The index fell
81.05 to 647.56 in turnover of Yn2.6bn.
The rumours prompted institutions and wealthy investors to launch a sell-off
of blue-chip Pudong shares, policy-sensitive Beijing companies and
influential large shares like Shanghai Petroleum.
Investors had begun to build up holdings in these issues in August,
prompting a bull run in the A share index which rose by 240 per cent over
five weeks.
The Shenzhen A index fell 12.87 or 7.8 per cent to 153.26 and the Shanghai B
index of shares available to foreigners, dipped 0.28 to 78.61.
SINGAPORE was in retreat at the close on profit-taking after recent gains,
although many institutional investors were inactive. Brokers said that
trading was sombre ahead of yesterday's US producer price data.
The Straits Times Industrials index closed 10.49 lower at 2,357.82.
Malaysian stocks traded over the counter shaved some gains but ended firm,
the UOB OTC index rising 3.18 to 1,249.36.
KUALA LUMPUR saw profit-taking after the strong gains of the previous two
days, and the composite index eased 1.33 to 1,135.67, with Hong Kong's
holiday curbing activity.
MANILA gained ground as domestic investors bought property issues, and
foreign funds concentrated on blue chips.
The composite index rose 20.29 to 2,990.75.
Turnover increased slightly to 1.5bn pesos.
SYDNEY fell back but closed down off session lows on renewed worries about
the economy and weakness in the bond market.
The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.7 to 1,998.9, in turnover of ADollars
428m.
The market recovered from a low of 1,987.5 in early trading as investors
reacted to September unemployment figures, which came in unchanged at 9.5
per cent.
Mining stocks were broadly lower, with BHP shedding 2 cents to ADollars
19.54, while MIM lost 6 cents to ADollars 2.73 and Western Mining 14 cents
to ADollars 8.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar responds cautiously to good inflation
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar rose yesterday after weaker than expected August US producer
inflation figures improved confidence in the outlook for US asset markets,
writes Philip Gawith.
There was little follow though buying, however, with market participants
wary ahead of today's retail sales and consumer inflation figures. Most
observers believe the dollar's bear trend is still intact.
After touching a high of DM1.5450, it slipped back to close in London at
DM1.5423, from DM1.5421. Against the yen it finished at Y99.915 after
spiking up to Y100.2.
Elsewhere, the Bundesbank council, as expected, left its official interest
rates unchanged, ahead of Sunday's national elections.
Sterling had a steady day, with the trade-weighted index finished unchanged
at 79.9.
The topsy turvy fortunes of the rouble continued, with the Russian currency
rising by 20 per cent against the US dollar, to Rs2,994 from Rs3,736.
The dollar repeated the recent pattern of taking its lead from the US bond
markets. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London,
commented: 'The dollar responded to better than expected inflation numbers,
and it has been worries about inflation that has been driving the dollar
down this year.'
But as Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, noted: 'Both (bonds and
the dollar) stopped at technical points, which suggests the market has not
got fundamental momentum behind it.'
Most of the market activity was interbank trade, with longer-term investors
sitting on the side, without a clear view of the direction of the dollar.
For the past month it has traded in a very narrow band, of barely more than
one pfennig, against the D-Mark.
Mr Cocker commented: 'It is very difficult at the moment to see what is
going to shake the market out of its inertia.'
Against the yen, the short term outlook for the dollar appears negative. Mr
Chris Dunne, analyst at Forexia, the market analyst, said that on a chart
basis, the dollar looked to be 'a screaming sell'. He said it was likely to
fall towards Y98 in the next two weeks, where it had good support. Over the
next three months, however, he said the dollar was likely to move towards
Y105. 'The market is forming a longer term bottom, but hasn't yet got the
nerve to test the upside.'
Mr Hannah said the yen uptrend remained intact, but added: 'The tide is
turning. There is no doubt about that.' He said Japan's trade surplus was
shrinking, as a result of economic recovery, and the stronger yen. Japan's
trade surplus had been lower than expected over the last two months, he
said.
The outlook for German interest rates depends on the outcome of the
elections. The market has convinced itself that Chancellor Kohl's coalition
will be returned to office. If this is the case, then the background of
falling inflation and lower money supply figures could allow one last cut in
official rates. The discount rate is currently 4 1/2 per cent, and the
Lombard rate 6 per cent.
An upset, however, would put events in a different light. Ms Alison
Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London, comments: 'If
the D-Mark comes under pressure because of the shape, or lack of shape, of
the government, then rates go up. When the government is weak, the
Bundesbank is at its strongest.'
In the more likely scenario of a Kohl victory, Ms Cottrell is strongly of
the view that rates will not rise. 'The Bundesbank will not put up rates
just for the sake of it.' She notes that the turmoil in France, and smaller
European countries, that such a move would cause, would precipitate
safe-haven flows into the D-Mark. The Bundesbank would want to avoid this,
as it would aggravate M3 money supply problems which are only now coming
under control.
The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.36bn of
assistance, at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds
1.35bn. With a large portion of the shortage cleared in the early round,
rates eased slightly. Three month LIBOR closing at 5 7/8 per cent from 5
15/16 per cent.
Futures markets responded positively to the good inflation news in the US.
Short sterling and euromark futures both rose across the board. The December
short sterling contract continued its recent rally, to finish seven basis
points higher at 93.62. The equivalent euromark contract closed at 94.78,
from 94.70.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The 'grass roots' strategy for
holding back the deserts - Efforts to involve local people more in the
battle against land degradation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF TANSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 100 governments are expected to sign a new convention to combat
desertification at the Paris headquarters of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation during a two-day conference starting
today.
Two fifths of the earth's land surface, with a fifth of the population, are
drylands susceptible to desertification. However, just how much land is
desertified and what desertification is - over 100 definitions have appeared
in the past 20 years - have been hotly debated.
Since the first desertification conference in 1977, the UN's own estimates
of the areas affected have fallen dramatically from about three-quarters of
drylands to less than a quarter, says Professor David Thomas, director of
the Sheffield Centre for International Drylands Research, Sheffield
University, in his recently published book Desertification: Exploding the
Myth.
In the convention, desertification is defined as 'land degradation in arid,
semi-arid and dry sub-humid tropics'. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, from
which the new convention emerged during follow-up negotiations, climatic
variation was added to human activities as a cause of desertification. This,
fears Prof Thomas, could be used as an excuse to avoid supporting the local
actions necessary to combat desertification caused by people.
Soil degradation is the key indicator of land degradation. Overall, about 20
per cent of the world's soils are degraded according to the latest global
survey. This was based on a computer database using local assessments of
degradation. If the light degradation category is omitted, as this covers
minor changes that can be easily reversed, the figure comes down to about 12
per cent.
Europe's relatively high figure applies mainly to the semi-arid lands around
the Mediterranean, while the low figure for Australia's dry land is because
most of the changes relate to vegetation in rangelands rather than the soil
itself, notes Prof Thomas.
Most degradation is caused by water and wind erosion, followed by chemical
degradation (salination, alkalination and nutrient loss) and physical
degradation (mainly compacting and crusting). About 6m hectares of land are
lost to desertification each year according to UN Environment Programme 1991
estimates.
Wherever it occurs the effects can be devastating for the people involved.
Many villagers near Hodeidha in Northern Tihama in Yemen, for example, have
lost their houses to encroaching sands. For 10,000 years, all but the farmed
areas of Yemen were covered by trees. Even the hot, dry coastal and inland
fringes of desert were thick with acacia until 30 years ago. But, for the
past few decades, traders have bought the trees for charcoal or building
materials. Over 1,000 sq km of desert have been created according to World
Bank reports, says Mr Tony Milroy of the Arid Lands Initiative, a small non
governmental organisation (NGO) working with local communities in rural
Yemen.
Elsewhere in Tihama, herders can still graze their goats on trees because
villagers have maintained the traditional practice of not cutting down live
trees. Other communities have organised their children to collect seeds and
local farmers are planting them into the denuded soil to re-establish cover,
using techniques from Australia, says Mr Milroy.
The common image of desertification is shifting sand dunes obliterating land
and housing. But this is true only in very specific and limited
circumstances, like those in Yemen, and not in much of the area fringing the
Sahara.
There has been a serious misunderstanding of how semi-arid areas adapt to
the large fluctuations in climatic conditions normal in those areas, says
Prof Thomas. Arid and semi-arid areas may have, for example, 15 to 20 years
with relative high rainfall then a similar period with little rain. The
vegetation dies off and the desert appears to advance but when rain returns,
so does the vegetation. People living in these semi-arid regions have also
adapted - moving their herds and varying their size, according to
conditions.
It is when other factors affect how the land is managed that desertification
arises - social and economic changes and population pressures may lead to
overcultivation, overgrazing, deforestation and poor irrigation practices,
any of which can trigger desertification. These vary in different regions,
making desertification not a single global problem with one solution but a
problem with global dimensions, many causes and many solutions. It needs not
grand global and national plans, but planning with and action by local
people, building on the systems used in many of these areas for centuries,
believes Prof Thomas.
Although the new convention's provisions are broad and often vague, unlike
earlier work it specifically stresses 'the importance of ensuring the full
participation of men and women at all levels in programmes to combat
desertification and mitigate the effects of drought'.
The problem, says Mr Milroy, is that neither the UN and national governments
lack structures suitable for working closely with local people. 'Our
research and documentation of practical success stories shows that
grass-roots initiatives that involve the real experts, local farmers,
livestock herders that have subsisted in low-rainfall areas for millenniums,
cannot only succeed but can be replicated at low cost without the
involvement of outside expertise.'
He and Prof Thomas are sceptical about the value of national plans and both
urge greater support and encouragement to NGOs able and willing to work with
local groups. Up to 50 NGOs from all over the globe will meet in Burkina
Faso in early November to ensure grass roots follow-up to the convention.
They will develop the networking abilities and pay particular attention to a
strategy for Africa.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European aluminium import
record forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Primary aluminium consumption in Europe, which ranks with north America as
the biggest market for the metal, is rebounding strongly this year but
production continues to fall. So there will be record imports in 1994, the
European Aluminium Association suggested yesterday.
Consumption is forecast to rise by 7.5 per cent to 4.84m tonnes, recovering
from a 7.5 per cent fall in 1993 to 4.53m tonnes, according to the
association.
Production, after dropping by 2.4 per cent to 3.27m tonnes in 1993, is
expected to be another 4 per cent down at under 3.13m tonnes.
Mr Fokko van Duyne, chairman of the association, painted an optimistic
picture for aluminium consumption in Europe, which already accounts for 27
per cent of the western world total. He suggested that it would rise by
between 2.5 and 3 per cent a year to reach nearly 6m tonnes by the year
2000. With consumption of secondary (scrap) metal rising faster - by an
annual 5 per cent - total aluminium requirements in Europe by then would be
about 8m tonnes.
That suggested that in the next five years Europe's primary aluminium
imports would jump by nearly 1m tonnes from 1.7m tonnes this year.
Production was not likely to go any lower, Mr van Duyne said, because there
was enough competitively priced energy available to support Europe's
remaining capacity.
He said the automotive industry offered the most impressive potential growth
area for worldwide aluminium consumption. 'Cautious estimates' suggested
aluminium use would grow from an average of 65kg a car to 115kg by 2000.
That would absorb an extra 2m tonnes.
'As more than 30 per cent of the world's car production is concentrated in
Europe there is an enormous potential for aluminium here,' he pointed out.
However Mr van Duyne warned that European Union national social-economic and
environmental policy could endanger aluminium growth prospects. He was
particularly concerned about 'ecological taxes' such as the European
CO-energy tax or a national 'ecotax' as implemented in Belgium.
'This is a very dangerous development. It will decrease consumer spending
power without providing other benefits except for raising the tax income of
governments.'
Mr Dick Dermer, the association president said exports of Russian aluminium
to the rest of the world were expected to rise again from 1.7m tonnes in
1993 to 2m tonnes this year. However, western world primary aluminium
consumption was forecast to rise by between 7.5m and 16.7m tonnes this year.
World supply and demand was making 'the first moves towards a more balanced
situation'.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK to present proposals for
opening Irish fishery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain presents its proposals to the European Commission today for opening
up European Union waters around Ireland to the Spanish and Portuguese
fishing fleets from 1996.
At the last fisheries council in September, a Commission proposal was
rejected as being too bureaucratic and unworkable. The Commission called for
member countries' own ideas on providing access to these sensitive waters
when Spain and Portugal become full members of the common fisheries policy
at the end of next year.
Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, said the British suggestions reflected
many of the views of fishermen after widespread consultation. 'Now, we need
to convince the council we have a workable alternative to the Commission's
proposal,' he said. He hoped the issue would be discussed at the next
fisheries council in November.
Spain had threatened to block the accession of Austria, Norway, Finland and
Sweden EU if rules for accommodating Spanish fishermen were not agreed by
the end of this year.
Mr Jack is calling for access to waters west of the UK, France and
north-west Spain to be restricted to vessels with established rights, with
special treatment for highly sensitive zones such as the Irish Box.
He wants the UK to be able to enforce access arrangements for all vessels in
its western waters. In addition, he wants larger vessels to be required to
report their entry into and exit from areas covered by the regulations and
to report catches. He is also proposing stronger technical conservation
measures.
The Commission had suggested allocation of standard vessel days to each
nation for fishing in these waters.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Faro mine revival plan
progresses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Former managers of Curragh, the collapsed Canadian mining group, are at an
advanced stage in raising funds to reopen the Faro lead/zinc mine in the
Yukon.
If the financing efforts succeed, the group aims to restart stripping at the
mine within the next two months. Production of concentrates would begin next
autumn.
Faro was the third-biggest producer of lead and fifth-biggest of zinc before
operations were halted at the end of 1992. Output that year totalled 322,000
tonnes of zinc and 181,000 tonnes of lead concentrate. It still has an
estimated life of about 10 years.
Mr Robert Granger, a Toronto lawyer who is chairman of Anvil Range, the
newly-created company that is trying to revive Faro, said the group was in
the final stages of talks with South Korea's Hyundai Group to acquire a
stake of just under 31 per cent in Anvil. Another 31 per cent would be held
by institutional investors, which are being canvassed to subscribe to a
CDollars 25m (Pounds 11.7m) private placement. Anvil aims to conclude this
within the next six weeks. It is also in the throes of launching a CDollars
30m public offering of tax-sheltered 'flow-through' shares and silver
royalty units. The management group, which bought Faro from Curragh's
receivers earlier this year for CDollars 27m, will retain an 8 per cent
stake.
The managers have been at pains to assure investors that Anvil Range has no
connection with Mr Clifford Frame, Curragh's controversial founder.
They estimate that, with zinc at 55-65 cents a pound and lead at 28 cents,
Faro will generate a positive cash flow, an 'attractive' net present value
and a 33 per cent return.

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian market hovered and tended a fraction easier in the first half
of the wool sales week, but subsequently began to show more strength, with
increases of 5-to 10 cents a kg. paid for some wools on the closing day.
This resulted in an Eastern states market indicator quotations of 738 cents
at the close, only one cent lower than a week before. China is reported to
have been a more active buyer of wool in Australia as the week progressed.
The view there is that this is the area where long-term demand will develop,
and after relatively subdued buying in the earlier weeks of the season price
rises could result from re-entry. Economic recovery and wool textile
activity combine to keep the background elsewhere sound, and a firmer
tendency after the recent world market setback could bring new orders
through, traders believe.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (8): Controversy
highlights difficulties - Efforts to harmonise European plugs and sockets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To the layman, it might seem odd that the world's standards authorities
cannot agree on a single set of standards for equipment as simple as the
plugs and sockets used for electrical domestic appliances.
But the controversy over present proposals for a harmonised European plug
and socket system shows that reaching agreement on the issue is extremely
difficult when so many different viewpoints are represented.
Safety experts, consumer groups, plug and socket manufacturers, appliance
makers and others have all had their say in the debate, and the various
views and technical opinions expressed seem irreconcilable.
Supporters of the proposal, which seems unlikely to be approved, believe a
chance may be missed - perhaps for the next 20 years - to establish a
standard that would benefit European consumers but could also pave the way
for a world equivalent. They believe the saga raises important questions
about the way such standards are decided.
Their opponents, especially in the UK, say the proposal raises serious
safety issues and could have disastrous industrial consequences. European
politicians and bureaucrats bent on harmonisation for its own sake are
accused of pushing the standards authorities into a corner.
The relevant standards setting system works as follows: the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has responsibility for worldwide
electrical standardisation.
The European electrical standards body is Brussels-based Cenelec, whose
policy is to adopt IEC standards as Cenelec standards as far as possible.
Cenelec is organised into technical committees which prepare European
standards on topics within their scope. In the case of plugs and sockets
this is called TC 23X.
Individual European countries are represented on this committee - for
example the UK representation is provided and briefed by the British
Standards Institution's technical committee PEL/4/3 covering installed
electrical accessories.
Countries do not have to adopt international standards, but if a European
standard achieves the required number of weighted votes, all 18 Cenelec
countries must adopt it, discarding in the process conflicting national
standards.
A derogation would be necessary to achieve exemption.
Various schemes have been suggested - and rejected - for a worldwide
standard, involving both flat-pin and round-pin plugs, since the IEC first
discussed the issue in 1966.
In Europe, which has about 20 conflicting systems, harmonisation first
became a political issue in 1991 after Cenelec produced a document called
Live with the Differences.
Its laisser faire thrust - self-explanatory from the title - was a red rag
to the European Commission, which demanded a fresh attempt to introduce a
common system.
Accordingly the technical committee TC 23X came up with a revised version of
a standard first issued in 1986 by the IEC for round-pin plugs, known as
906-1 and so far implemented only in South Africa, but not totally.
The Cenelec version proposed a small, moulded two-pin round plug - with a
three-pin version for appliances that need earthing. The pins were widened
from the 4.5mm in the IEC standard to 4.8mm so that they could fit most
continental European systems without being 'dangerously compatible.'
The UK plug and socket industry, backed by some safety experts, has been
mounting a well-organised campaign against the proposal. It says the new
Cenelec plug could, in some cases, be dangerously inserted into UK sockets,
some of which have holes wide enough for the 4.8mm pins. It also says the
British ring main system requires fused plugs, while the Cenelec proposal is
for unfused plugs, as used on the continent's radial networks.
Supporters of the proposal say the UK flat-pin system - introduced in 1947
and based on the standard BS 1363 - is overfused, has safety problems of its
own, is awkward for arthritics and has outlived its usefulness because it is
not suited to modern appliance use.
The battle is also being waged on the economic front.
Claims by the Electrical Installation Equipment Manufacturers Association
that the new plugs could make half the UK industry's Pounds 1.3bn capital
employed redundant are rebuffed by opponents.
A recent report for the Department of Trade and Industry on the costs and
benefits to the UK of plug and socket harmonisation in Europe said British
consumers would face costs of Pounds 78m a year for 40 years if the UK
backed the harmonisation and opted for 'a big bang' changeover.
But Mr Simon Hossack, a leading campaigner for the harmonisation proposal,
has told the DTI that the port contains fundamental errors which potentially
turn its cost-benefit conclusions on their head.
The Cenelec committee is now working on the final draft for its proposal,
which would then be sent to the individual country committees for voting.
The aim is for a result by around the middle of next year. However, with
large countries having 10 votes and small countries five, it only takes
opposition from three countries to exceed the 22 votes necessary to kill the
proposal.
Mr Hossack is concerned that the final proposal will almost certainly fail
because of French, Spanish and Italian objections to the detailed
specification for the body thickness at the point where the cable enters the
plug.
Then there is the fierce opposition of the UK and reservations among other
national committees, notably Germany.
Mr Hossack believes the saga shows that the standards setting process is not
working.
'It has to be open, transparent and totally accountable, but at the moment
it is putting standard-setting in the hands of manufacturers, rather than
consumers.'
He claims BSI has failed to take effective action to prevent plug and socket
manufacturers from dominating the UK committee - a criticism echoed strongly
last year by appliance manufacturers who felt their views were being
ignored.
But BSI rejects this, saying it has no commercial interest in, nor influence
over, the conclusions reached by technical committees; it merely facilitates
their work. It says PEL4/3 has trade association membership from
manufacturers and users of plugs and sockets, consumers, government, safety
experts, certifiers, testers, cable makers, academic institutions and many
more.
In contrast to Mr Hossack, Mr Dave Dossett, EIEMA's director, says the issue
does not suggest the standards organisations have lessons to learn. Rather,
he believes the European Commission takes 'the lion's share of the blame'
for bulldozing the Cenelec committee into drawing up a standard without
giving it time to do the job properly.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (9): Buyer beware - check
the label / Claire Gooding takes a look at the role of the consumer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer power is usually associated with protest and defence, rather then
with positive input. The consumer is the person who grumbles when the handle
snaps off the vacuum cleaner, who is anxious to contribute to the
environment by using eco-friendly products, and who may get killed by badly
wired electrical appliances.
Consumers who look for help when something goes wrong generally turn to the
supplier first, then local consumer organisations. This is only the start of
a long chain.
Respected retailers pride themselves on thorough testing of goods. The
testers themselves have to be tested.
That accreditation has to be done to a standard acceptable in other
countries, to enable other goods and services to come from other sources.
It seems far-removed from the consumer, but this is where Iso, the
International Organisation for Standardisation, comes in, its thousands of
standards defining product aspects such as dimensions, safety, fit and
performance.
Its most famous product is Iso 9000, which establishes standards for quality
management.
'Consumers need standards to protect them; standards need a consumer input
to be practical and useful'.
This declaration is part of the campaign associated with World Standards
Day, celebrated each year on October 14 by all member countries of Iso and
its partners - the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
Its theme this year is 'Standards and the consumers: partners for a better
world'.
Iso is not the first name that would occur to an aggrieved consumer, but it
will be somewhere at the end of the chain. It has a long history of
producing voluntary, consensus-based standards, which feed into the design
process at one end of the cycle, and into testing and accreditation
processes at the other.
Most countries have a national structure through which international
standards are filtered. In Britain, the Consumer Protection Act requires
that any specific safety standards are applied to a product.
It is an offence to sell goods that do not comply either with specific
safety regulations or with general safety requirements. Enforcement of the
act falls to the 120 or so local authorities.
'The role of local authorities is to make sure that no one is selling
anything unsafe,' explains Mr Gordon Powell, assistant director of consumer
protection at Westminster City Council.
'Consumers themselves might not be aware of the specific technical standards
behind that duty: you'd have to be a technologist or scientist to understand
the technical requirements.
'The real issue is that these safeguards should be built in at manufacture.'
It is in manufacture that international standards are most influential. Such
standards are voluntary, but they influence every stage of the production
and retail process that eventually brings goods into homes.
The process of standardisation is also spreading to services and affects
international issues such as environment and the economic development of
non-industrialised countries.
For most people, it is the safety aspect of consumer-based standards that
springs to mind first. The danger of fumes from foam-filled furniture, and
of clothing made of cotton that has not been fireproofed, have made
headlines.
The problems have been duly scrutinised and researched by Iso and voluntary
standards exist in these and many other areas.
Technical standards affect consumers in other, less visible, ways. The range
stretches far beyond household goods and technical appliances to include
medical instruments, plastics, telecommunications, transport, computers and
sports equipment.
It is thanks to international standards that a Russian smart card -
incidentally, for smarter than most European credit cards - exactly fits the
appropriate slots in western wallets.
The standard-makers presently face challenges in the fields of information
technology (IT) in general, multimedia, and the 'information highway' which
allows people around the world to dip into databases.
This is underlined by the fact that the World Standards Day message was
signed by Mr John Hinds, president of Iso, Dr Hans Gissel, president of the
IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) and Pekka Tarjanne,
secretary-general of the ITU.
However, Iso's vice-president for technical management, Mr John Kean - who
also heads the Canadian Standards Association - acknowledges that it is not
easy to get the consumer's voice heard in the standards process, which tends
to act through national bodies.
'We have-to address this issue in the future. The true consumer voice has to
be heard and acknowledged. It's all the more true as we deal with standards
for services as opposed to standards for products.'
He cites as an example the difficulty of agreeing on an international
standard for hotel rating - important to some developing countries that rely
on tourism, but whose base of experienced travellers might be limited inside
the country itself.
'If we can get people into the debate, to agree within regions, within
countries, and get input from regulatory authorities, then what comes out
will be more meaningful than if we don't have their voice.
'But the more we do this, the more complex it becomes, because there are so
many issues to tackle: the environment is just one example.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (7): Perception is
changing - Claire Gooding examines progress in developing countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Eritrea a factory is being built that will export equipment for eye
operations worldwide. The enterprise was started by a New Zealander who
developed a cheap, simple, but effective way of treating cataract blindness.
He took his invention where it was most needed, keen that the country that
suffered the problem should also benefit from the earning power of its
solution.
The highest standards of production ensure that the equipment produced by
the Eritreans can be exported all over Africa and wherever else it is
needed.
A true story, but sadly unusual, not least because industrialised countries
tend to think of themselves as having the monopoly on innovation, with
developing countries dismissed as providing shoddy derivatives.
This perception is changing, thanks to widespread adoption of international
standards. Of 107 countries now associated with the International
Organisation for Standardisation (Iso), many are developing countries who
take part in the one-country, one-vote system. Yemen became the hundredth
Iso member in March 1994 and seven more countries have joined since then,
the most recent being Costa Rica and Guyana.
The rapidly growing membership is widening both the scope and the
applications of Iso's energies. Recent members include Belarus and the
Ukraine, with well-developed industrial sectors, and the small island
nations of Fiji and Grenada, where tourism is the principal economic
activity.
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) - housed in the same
Geneva site as Iso, and working closely with it - is responsible for
wide-ranging standards in electronics. The IEC has positively encouraged
electrotechnical standardisation in countries that are not yet members. It
has been running a one-year programme to encourage adoption of IEC
standards, to help globalise technology transfer.
IEC forums in such places as Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Harare have been set
up to spread the word and make the standards more accessible.
'Many small-scale economies can only grow by exporting goods, and so they
have to be interested in international standards,' says Mr Lawrence Eicher,
Iso secretary-general.
'Iso is a route to technical knowledge transfer because it represents an
international consensus. Such countries don't have the resources to
re-invent the wheel, whether they are using a product internally, or making
it for export. They look for a credible label, so adopting Iso is a route to
international respectability.'
Mr John Hinds, Iso president, also stressed the importance of avoiding a
'cheap and nasty' label, at a World Bank seminar in 1992. 'Exporters in
developing countries may offer highly competitive prices, but they won't
make the sale if their products and commodities don't meet the standards
buyers impose.'
Mr Robert Toth of Toth Associates, a consultant to the World Bank, undertook
a survey of international standards, completed in 1993. In the report
Technical and Business Factors Affecting Electronic Distribution of
Standards, Mr Toth gives examples of the benefits to be gained by partaking
in IECQ, the IEC's certification scheme to assess conformity to standards.
He cites a testing facility in New Delhi set up with aid from the Indian
government, and investment from Germany and the European Union totalling
Dollars 16m.
'Why should the Europeans make such an investment? Because the Indian market
for telecommunications equipment is in excess of Dollars 40bn over the next
10 years,' comments Mr Toth. 'Manufacturers see it as worthwhile to assure
the quality of component parts made by a low-cost producer, India. The parts
are used in equipment sold not only in India but all over the world.
'In India, the technical assistance is having a ripple effect as parts
manufacturers conform to Iso 9000.'
The IEC stresses that its schemes aim to encourage trade, not stifle it or
raise trade barriers masquerading as standards. Yet there are those who take
the latter view, inevitably, according to Anwar El-Tawil, secretary of
Devco, the Iso committee on developing country matters. Devco's job is to
assist developing countries to define and meet their needs in the area of
standardisation. It includes regional officers from Latin America, the
Caribbean, Africa, and east and south-east Asia.
International standards for environmental auditing and eco-labelling,
presently under development by the Iso committee TC 207 should help with
harmonisation. In the meantime, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's
inquiry points provide information on export rules.
Mr John Kean, Iso's vice-president (technical) is particularly sensitive to
the needs of developing countries. 'If we really truly believe we are going
to give developing countries a fair chance, standards have to be written in
such a way that they can be understood.
'The more clarity we have, the better.'
Mr Kean promotes the idea of 'continual improvements' as espoused by the Iso
approach.
'It's impossible for developing countries to reach new standards in one
jump, but important to get them to buy in to the process.'
As for developing countries contributing to the process of determining
standards, El-Tawil believes they seldom have enough technical expertise to
take part in the formulation.
'It takes resources - travel, finance, and the time of an expert, a key
member of staff - to attend meetings.
'Iso can assist in such cases, but even so, the member bodies may not be
dynamic enough to mobilise industry: the appropriate trade and industry
contacts and relationships have to be in place.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (6): Environment has been
transformed - Three Geneva-based institutions produce 96% of all published
standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are more than 200 organisations in the world writing international
standards - but over 96 per cent of all published standards come from three
Geneva-based institutions, the International Organisation for
Standardisation (Iso), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),
and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).
In broad terms, the ITU, a United Nations specialised agency, handles
telecommunications and broadcasting; the IEC deals with the electrotechnical
sector including electronics; and Iso tackles everything else. Iso's
catalogue of more than 9,400 technical standards ranges from paper sizes and
film speeds to the thickness of machine-readable plastic cards and the
symbols on car dashboards.
Increasingly, however, the three work together on new technologies such as
multimedia for which the traditional demarcations make no sense.
Unlike the ITU, Iso and the IEC are independent non-governmental
organisations; Iso groups 107 national standards bodies while IEC's 49
members are national committees representing private and public sector
interests.
Their standards are voluntary: the need for a particular standard is
identified by members, the details are worked out between them on the basis
of consensus and there is no compulsion on industry to adopt the standard
once published.
However, the pressures of regional economic integration and global
interdependence are increasingly making the use of international standards
essential for doing business. These pressures, and rapid technological
change, have transformed the environment in which Iso and the IEC operate.
Some countries have simply abandoned writing new national standards and gone
straight for international ones. The European Union's standards
organisations now work in close co-operation with Iso and the IEC.
More than 90 per cent of standards published by Cenelec (the European
Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation) are based on international
standards. For CEN (the European Committee for Standardisation) the figure
is more than 40 per cent.
Interest in standards has also been reinforced by provisions in the Uruguay
round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. New rules on lowering
technical barriers to trade call on Gatt's 120-plus members to use
international standards where possible and take an active part in
international standard-setting.
Growing demand for international standards has required a restructuring of
operations to handle a greater through-put of standards and cut delivery
times. At the same time, Iso and the IEC have had to rethink their role in
standard-setting.
In the past, they acted mainly as co-ordinators of initiatives from national
standards bodies. Now, they are being called upon to lead from the front in
identifying where international standards are needed and what form they
should take. Industry is demanding standards that are market-related,
cost-effective and timely. Providing these is no easy task.
Iso and the IEC have always relied on their members to do most of the work
in developing standards, with the central organisation co-ordinating their
activities and publishing the results. Iso, with 157 headquarters staff, has
some 2,800 technical groups on the go involving about 30,000 people in any
one year. The IEC's 100-odd staff keep tabs on about 1,000 technical bodies
involving up to 20,000 people.
Measures to streamline this highly decentralised system, including greater
use of information technology, have succeeded in producing more standards
faster. The IEC and Iso have doubled their output of standards since 1988;
the IEC produced nearly 400 new and revised standards last year, Iso 764. Mr
Lawrence Eicher, Iso secretary-general, reckons that production levels of
standards and services 'could easily increase by 30 to 50 per cent by the
end of 1996'.
Simultaneously, the IEC has reduced average development time from more than
80 months five years ago to less than 30 months in the first half of 1994.
Since 1988, Iso has cut 2 1/2 years off delivery times to 54 months in 1992,
while the number of technical pages produced has risen by 20 per cent a
year. Nevertheless, the average remains well above Iso's goal of 'three
years start-to-finish'.
The type of standard being demanded has also changed. Attention has
increasingly focused on the environment, quality management systems,
services, multimedia and emerging technologies more generally. There is a
growing emphasis on performance-based and cross-product 'horizontal'
standards rather than conventional standards based on design specifications.
In the information technology sector, for example, standards have focused on
ensuring compatibility of interfaces and performance requirements, leaving
companies free to develop competing devices and systems within those
parameters.
The IEC has also established a specialised group on future technologies to
try to keep abreast of developments and anticipate the need for standards,
including standards for systems rather than individual products.
New areas being eyed by Iso include developing standards for services,
especially consumer services such as tourism - for example, a common star
system for rating hotels. Other potential areas for international
standardisation include data protection and privacy, financial transfers and
credit reporting.
Among 'horizontal' standards, by far the best known is Iso's astonishingly
successful Iso 9000 series of quality management standards, used by
thousands of businesses in more than 70 countries. Following that success,
Iso has set up a new technical committee to develop environmental management
standards and another on requirements for health care products.
The IEC has a group looking at ways of integrating environmental
considerations into product standards on a life cycle basis, from design to
disposal. It also has standards on electrical product safety that cover all
types of electrical equipment.
Another potential growth area for both organisations concerns assessment of
conformity with international standards. One of the biggest applications
will be in quality management where Iso and the IEC are developing a joint
voluntary scheme known as QSAR (Quality System Assessment Recognition) 'for
worldwide recognition of Iso 9000 quality management system registrations'.
The aim is to ensure that a certificate granted in one country will be
acceptable worldwide, avoiding a situation where companies are obliged to
undergo multiple costly audits to satisfy customers in different countries.
The IEC already runs two separate certification schemes, one on the safety
of electrical equipment and one for electronic components. It also plans to
introduce a certification scheme for hazardous-area electrical equipment.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (4): Developers have to
co-operate - Mobile Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The area of mobile communications is another where development is so fast
that developers are having to co-operate to create standards, writes Claire
Gooding.
Pan-European communications have been difficult to establish in a market
complicated by differing infrastructures and implementations, and complex
inter-country interconnection agreements.
The Mobitex network is acclaimed as a de facto standard for wireless data
transmission, with networks established in the UK, France, Sweden, Finland,
Norway and the Netherlands, Canada, the US, Australia and Chile - and under
development in Belgium, Germany and Singapore.
'With privatisation, and the rapid changes in the telecommunications
industry, it's difficult for the European Technical Standards Institute to
keep up with the workload,' says Mr John Nicholson, operations director of
RAM Mobile Data.
'It makes sense to adopt de facto standards, and Mobitex is a case in point.
'Standards lead to greater awareness in the marketplace, but it is a little
early in the market as yet. One advantage is that once a standard exists,
such as the GSM (General Special Radio) that is accepted in most European
countries, it is a benefit to consumers and brings the price down.'
Mr Andrew Robb, who now heads the European operations of Geotek
Communications, agrees with the need for standards.
'As a network operator, we want to encourage open standards,' says Mr Robb
who was until recently the managing director of Geotek's UK subsidiary
National Band 3, the national trunk network providing mobile communications
to fleets of commercial vehicles such as couriers.
National Band 3 is widely used by brown and white goods services: customers
include Radio Rentals and Granada TV.
Mr Robb points to standards being developed in the European Community such
as the Trans European Truck Radio standard, Tetra, and the technical
standard MPT Ministry of Post and Telecommunications.
'For customers, it should be like plugging into electricity,' says Mr Robb.
'They should be able to move between operators. The consequence of having
standards is that every element can approach the market with a great deal
more confidence, because standards mean that there is a greater chance of
achieving volume sales, lower prices and greater choice for the customer.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (5): UK has 36 official
groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quality control in the UK is carried out by 36 accredited bodies, the
largest and best-known of which is the British Standards Institution, writes
Sheila Jones.
These bodies assess management and production systems as well as product
quality. Before operating, they are assessed by the National Accreditation
Council for Certification Bodies, the central organisation responsible for
ensuring that those seeking the right to give products their stamp of
approval have first won approval themselves. Once an approved body is up and
running, it is reviewed by the NACCB twice a year and reassessed every four
years.
In the global markets of the 1990s, manufacturers ignore quality systems and
standards 'at their peril,' according to Mr Paul Hewlett, who has just
retired as NACCB secretary.
His successor, Mr Robin Bullock-Webster, takes over at the NACCB at a
difficult time. The way in which quality control and certification is
carried out in the UK has been much criticised in recent years. The
criticism reached a crescendo earlier this year with the publication of a
report - UK Quality Management - by the Science and Engineering Policy
Studies Unit. The report asserted, among other things, that there was little
to inspire confidence in a system that attracted its 'share of cowboys'.
Mr Bullock-Webster concedes it is legal for anyone to set themselves up as a
quality control assessor without NACCB approval. In addition to the 36
approved bodies, there are many organisations and consultancies selling
advice on the implementation of standards and quality control.
'In this country there are many hundreds of consultants making a living out
of 5750 (the BSI's production systems standard). I'm sure that the vast
majority of those are fair, reasonable level-headed and well-meaning. There
are inevitably some that are not.'
Certification that is 'meaningful', says Mr Bullock-Webster, is 'that which
has gone through the accredited process. There are possibly some 30,000
certificates which are now accredited on the market within the UK and I
think that that probably, to a degree, speaks for itself. I'm not saying
that we've got it all right, but we are trying to ensure that we do control
the situation.'
The NACCB has tightened up its surveillance of certification bodies and is
carrying out market research among UK businesses 'to establish exactly where
they think we're going right or where they think we're going wrong'. It is
also running workshops on quality control and the NACCB's role.
A further criticism, of the relationship between the NACCB and the BSI, has
prompted the two organisations to break a link that has existed since the
NACCB was set up. The BSI is itself split into two sections: BSI, which sets
British standards; and BSI-QA, the quality assurance arm. BSI-QA is just
another NACCB-approved certification body, perhaps best-known for its kite
mark stamp of approval on products. However, the BSI is also responsible for
NACCB funding. Mr Bullock-Webster points out that the while funding for pay
and administration is chanelled through the BSI, the organisation has no
involvement in policy, pay levels or recruitment. Nonetheless, the
'umbilical cord will be cut some time shortly.'
The decision to break the link follows assessment of the NACCB last year by
the European umbrella body for accreditation bodies, the EAC, as part of the
process of harmonisation. The EAC broadly approved of the NACCB's operations
but it felt that the BSI link 'could be construed as tying us rather too
closely to the BSI,' according to Mr Bullock-Webster.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (3): Sliver of Zen
philosophy - Information technology is an area of schisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a sliver of Zen philosophy embedded in the way that information
technology standards are created. Let something go, and if it's really worth
anything, it will come back as a standard.
The great 'enabling' technologies of IT have been developed by companies who
have made their software public. The SQL database language Structured Query
Language was developed by IBM, International Business Machines, then the
world's most powerful supplier of mainframe computing power.
IBM shared the development secrets of SQL with the software market. It is
now the de facto standard tool for making data accessible, and differing
databases 'transparent.' The initial S is increasingly explained as meaning
'Standard'.
IT is an area of schisms, where posturing about standards is part of a
fast-moving commercial game: players jump in the right direction, or they
are out.
Unable to wait for an authoritative decree, users have stampeded into 'de
facto' standards.
Examples include PC DOS, the operating system adopted by IBM for its
personal computer, that established the dominance of software house
Microsoft and proved the foundation for a marketplace in applications.
The Windows environment has fast succeeded as equally 'standard', although
it is developed, owned and promoted by one company, Microsoft.
Unix, the multi-user operating system, was developed 20 years ago (but never
promoted) by a telephone company, AT&amp;T, which used to license it to
universities, bugs and all. Despite its technical shortcoming it was adopted
by dozens of mid-range manufacturers as a 'portable' operating environment.
They believed it would be in everyone's interest to break away from
proprietary systems and establish a common platform.
It is now taken for granted in the IT community that applications running on
one Unix computer can be transported to another with little or no change.
The effect has been similar to that of PC DOS on the PC: an empowered
marketplace, and a real choice of supplier for consumers, which has driven
prices down.
The process was not painless. The standards associated with Unix were once
bitterly contended by two opposing camps. Now resolved, differences are
hammered out by Posix committees whose jobs involve sorting out wearisome,
but vital detail.
X/Open is an organisation originally set up by suppliers to take care of the
wider 'applications environment' (the tools and techniques that fall outside
the actual operating software, but enable applications to run).
It is increasingly driven by users, who are taking a voice in the direction
of standards, traditionally set and maintained by developers.
The various consortia and organisations involved in developing standards
have in the past not been able to move fast enough to stay in line with
technical developments, such as, most recently, multimedia and wireless
communications.
Three of the most influential standards bodies have taken steps to galvanise
the process. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the
international organisation for standardisation (Iso), and the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) mounted a conference on the challenge of
multimedia a month ago.
'International standards, are not an option, they are minimum requirement,'
Mr Philip Dodds, executive director of the US-based interactive Multimedia
Association told the gathering.
Dr Hans Gissel, president of the IEC, stated the challenge:'Are we in the
technical and standards communities sending the right messages to service
providers about which technologies are available, which are immature, and
which are stable?'
It's a difficult question to answer, and one presently being addressed by
the first Joint Technical Committee set up in 1987 by Iso and the IEC, (JTC
1). In addition IEC proposes to combine three of its existing IEC committees
into a new one, covering sound, vision and multimedia systems and equipment.
There is already a multimedia standardisation project within ETSI, the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute.
IBM's director of standards relations, Mary Anne Lawler, has been chairman
of JTC1 since 1991 and is proud of its speedy response.
'JTC1 has a reputation for producing standards faster than any other formal
standards body. It is taking us three years to produce an IT standard, but
we feel that could be even better.'
She talks about mechanisms to include the work already done on 'publicly
available specifications', and seems to leave the door open to the various
consortia working on de facto standards.
'Multimedia is very fast-moving, but we have a successful track record: the
MPG Motion Picture Expert Group is already in its second standard, MPEG 2.'
MPEG and its companions are familiar to Mr Nick Dredge, software development
manager at multimedia training company AirteQ. AirteQ is standards-aware, as
the publisher of a multimedia training aid called FastraQ 9000 for companies
undertaking BS 5750 certification (being renamed BS EN Iso 9000). But that
is not enough, explains Mr Dredge.
'Proprietary tools are geared towards producing stand-alone applications,
not to interoperability. Other organisations are also starting to build up
libraries of multimedia assets and, like us, they need to know what assets
they have and where they reside - an on-line multimedia database.'
AirteQ's solution was a piece of software called Arkiver which catalogues
and gives 'transparent' access to a library of video and audio material
available across a network. 'We're working towards open architecture which
takes away the constraints of the current chaos,' says Mr Dredge.
'Currently, the product is being evaluated by our peer group, because our
intention is to get it accepted as a de facto industry standard.'
Even the Association for Computing Machinery, the august US body which
oversees the disparate IT community, has problems with the fractured nature
of the multimedia market. It published the proceedings of a recent ACM
computer graphics conference on three CD-ROMs, all needing different access
methods.
Anyone wanting to reference them needs a plethora of different multimedia
protocols and acronyms: Adobe Acrobat and NPEG for case notes, Apple
Quicktime and MPEG - Multimedia Program Extra Group for movie formats, TIFF
for images, and three different tools for the organisation of the disc.
Mr Martin Easterbrook, a systems engineer at Silicon Graphics, one of the
companies at the forefront of multimedia, cites this need for different
protocols to interpret data as typical of the irritations caused by lack of
standards.
'The consumer ought to be able to buy a disc and plug it in without worrying
how it is going to work,' he says. 'Official standards tend to move too
slowly for the computer industry, and the unofficial standards tend to
become political, with rival computers adopting opposite stances. The stance
at Silicon Graphics is that we go for the de facto standard. Companies have
to grab the standard and make it work for them.'
Silicon Graphics is seeking to take part in the establishment of de facto
industry-wide standards for multimedia. It is part of a group, Open GL
(Graphics Library), working on making resources available to any
applications. The group, including IBM, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, got together
because the present 'official' graphics standard, FIGS, did not go far
enough, and had got left behind by the fast rate of development in
multimedia.
The GL standard can openly be changed by a majority consensus, including
associate members.
Other subjects under discussion are standards vital to the development of
the much-publicised 'video on demand.' The common terms here are JPEG, used
to compress images and MPEG, which is faster because it interprets only the
changes between one frame and the next.
Various sub-committees of JTC 1 deal with imaging and computer graphics: one
of the newest sub-committees, JTC 1-SC 29, is dealing with standards of
digitally-coded representation for audio, picture, multimedia and hypermedia
information.
Cross-platform portability of multimedia and hypermedia is the subject of
another new standard, Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group, MHEG, due for
completion by the end of 1994.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (2): Towards global
awareness - Environmental issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Black South African families in the Johannesburg township of Soweto are
buying their first electric fridges. As the Soweto electrification programme
proceeds, they are joining the consumer boom, and no-one is going to stop
them. Certainly not anyone who has experienced the consequences of having a
mesh-wire cupboard on legs as the sole aid to preserving perishable
foodstuffs in the heat of an African summer.
First-time consumers, along with many others across the world, probably do
not have environmental matters high on their shopping list. But that will
change, according to Mr John Kean, vice-president for technical management
for the International Organisation for Standardisation (Iso), who is also
chief executive of the Canadian Standards Association.
'There has to be education. The new consumer, just coming into
electrification for the first time, may not look for the same level of
standards that experienced users take for granted. But I think the global
communication we have today - such as instant television, and so on - is
ensuring a higher level of education about this issue.
'People want a say in things, and this is going to be just as much the case
in third world countries. I think it may be surprising how quickly awareness
spreads. People are on the global information highway: they really do have
instant access to information. A TV watcher in Soweto can see programmes on
a manufacturing problem in Birmingham, or anywhere else in the world.'
In the UK, the consumers of the future - the present generation of
schoolchildren - take a close interest in environmental issues. They nag
their parents as never before about using aerosols, recycling packaging, and
buying eco-friendly products. Consumer awareness of the environment and its
well-being has never been so high in developed countries, aided by the
publicity surrounding such events as the Earth Summit in Rio in June 1992.
Retailers and manufacturers are experiencing a pincer movement, from
consumers at one end, and regulators at the other. Yet the majority of
dangers do not come from the products visible on the supermarket shelf.
'Environmental issues are business issues,' declares Mr Lawrence Eicher,
secretary-general of Iso. 'The environmental standards that we develop
internationally will not only affect corporate profitability and world
trade, they will also affect the livelihood and health of millions of
people.'
Policing is not enough, argue those concerned in environmental matters.
Environmental concern has to be designed into the entire life cycle of
products and, just as important, services.
Nowhere is the rule of 'what can't be measured can't be delivered' more
difficult to apply. Replying to the sceptical, Mr Eicher points to Iso 9000
and its remarkable success as a quality measure in manufacturing, industry
and commerce in more than 50 countries.
Spreading the Iso 9000 principle to environmental issues is the aim of Iso
14000. The starting point is a set of rules for managing environmental
issues, which will create a worldwide yardstick.
Iso has been developing environmental standards since 1947, when one of its
first published standards dealt with acoustics. The issue of 'sustainable
development' has been on its agenda for more than 20 years.
'Environmental problems are by their nature international, and can only be
solved at international level,' reads an Iso bulletin from 1972. 'All laws,
regulations and standards concerning air and water should repose on the same
scientific and technological base. By developing the appropriate
international standards, Iso can provide that base.'
Already there are more than 350 international standards with environmental
relevance on the Iso's books. They include Iso/TC 22, Road Vehicles, which
has developed numerous standards related to exhaust emissions, and other
Iso/TC (Technical Committee) standards on nuclear energy, plastics
biodegradability, heating efficiency and emissions, and solid waste
management.
More recently it has risen to meet the challenges of setting environmental
standards with a number of initiatives. The committee Iso/TC 207, on
environmental management, was set up in January 1993 following two years of
work by Sage - the Strategic Advisory Group on Environment. Sage was the
result of co-operation between the Iso and the IEC, the authority
responsible for global standardisation in the electrical and electronics
fields.
Both organisations have spent years developing voluntary standards as
guidance for industry and regulatory authorities on environmental issues.
The IEC had its own Advisory Committee on Environmental Aspects to promote
and co-ordinate efforts.
Sage's job was to examine the problems and potential solutions afresh, and
come up with co-ordinated strategies. The result is TC 207, a committee
whose brief includes co-ordination and co-operation with international and
regional governmental bodies, including the European Union, General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and many others.
The TC 207 sub-committees cover management systems, auditing, labelling,
performance evaluation and life cycle assessment. Early work includes a
guide for the inclusion of environmental aspects in product standards, and
standards for environmental management systems.
Mr Kean is an evangelist for Iso 14000. 'The environment is something we're
all part of, and we have to protect it for future generations. By focusing
on management, we're trying to get people to think ahead; address issues so
that they are thinking about the environment on a day-to-day basis. It has
to be pro-active rather than reactive.'
The standards should prompt designers to think about a product's impact on
the environment. The checklist of design requirements covers how an item
will be produced, used, and eventually disposed of, and what effects all
stages of the process will have on the environment.
'It has to be a systems approach, involving the whole process, from
conception to grave,' adds Mr Kean. 'We can never be 100 per cent sure of
effects, but we can be better equipped to ask the right questions.'
There are drawbacks. At last month's Iso conference on the environment, in
Nice - and entitled 'A challenge for international standardisation'  - the
president of the French movement Generation Ecologie, Mr Brice Lalonde,
pointed out that countries whose industries applied the standards could find
themselves disadvantaged if built-in environmental standards resulted in
higher costs than those of less careful competitors.
Having a measure might encourage participation by some of the companies who
have been watching the process nervously from the sidelines. So thinks Gib
Hedstrom, who, after 20 years in environmental auditing in the US recently
took up an appointment as vice-president of the the environmental health and
safety practice at Arthur D Little in Brussels.
'A standard takes some of the fear away,' he says. 'If we have a measure, we
can start to manage. Then we can move away from the litigious, defensive
position that what you can't measure, can't be used against you, to a caring
and sharing situation where former competitors and adversaries co-operate
and share data on emissions.'
Standards focus attention on the issues, and fuel investment in the
development of alternative technologies. Consumers react to environmental
issues, whether at the level of buying eco-friendly washing powder or
investing in ethical funds. But 'green' environmentalists argue that
standards are based on what is possible, rather than what is necessary.
Even so there is a catch: the long-term effects of our efforts can hold
unpleasant surprises. Clean, efficient nuclear power brought about the
Chernobyl disaster. Asbestos, once thought a boon for insulation, has proved
to be a killer in human lungs.
Many environmentally-aware people have in recent years espoused diesel
engines in their cars. But a recent report from the Ashden Trust indicated
that the rise in childhood asthma in the UK was directly attributable to
high levels of emissions from such car engines.
Many schoolchildren take for granted the car rides to and from school:
two-car families are on the increase.
It is a sad example of environmental irony if the youngsters who campaign so
fervently against acid rain and lecture their parents about global warming
are also condemned, by well-intentioned consumers and retailers, to wheeze
into inhalers.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Survey of International Standards (1): The starting point is
an agreement - It is the voluntary nature of standards that makes them
valuable and workable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zigzagging across the South African city of Johannesburg is a reminder of
what can happen when standards differ. The jagged line of Twist Street
commemorates the point at which the two city planners - working inward to
the same grid plan - finally met, about 100 years ago.
The hazards of Twist Street's staggered junctions are due, so the story
goes, to the fact that one builder worked in metres, the other in yards and
inches.
True or apocryphal, it is an example of the problems which are caused for
consumers by the lack of standards.
The starting point of standards has to be an agreement on the physical
measures which are going to be used, a problem which new technologies have
always had to surmount.
Travellers on Britain's early railroads, for example, had to change trains
between different rail tracks, and engines had to be built to different
specifications, until the gauge was nationally agreed by railway engineers
in the nineteenth century at 4ft 8 1/2 in.
In both these cases, those most inconvenienced were the 'consumers' whose
travel times were increased by the absence of a common standard.
More recently, the absence of a common video cassette standard, before the
eventual triumph of the VHS system over its Betamax rival, led to similar
confusion and inconvenience for customers.
The railway example pre-dates the setting up of the International
Organisation for Standardisation (Iso) by more than 100 years.
This is the body which consumers have to thank, with its partner the
International Electrotechnical Commission, for many of the things they take
for granted. These include the ability to plug a standard light bulb into a
socket, (though still in two different formats, screw and bayonet), the
uniform dimensions of leading credit cards used around the world, the
familiar dashboard symbols on cars indicating lights, windscreen wipers,
horn and other equipment, and the conformity of paper sizes.
To the IEC, in particular, goes the credit for harmonising worldwide the
rules for wiring buildings, and attempts, still as yet to reach fruition, to
standardise Europe's electrical plugs and sockets. (Report, Page 4).
Iso has been developing standards since it was founded in 1947 and it has
always operated by consensus. This is of course due to the fact that the
providers of goods and services have more to gain by keeping in line with an
agreed set of standards than they have to lose. The voluntary nature of
standards is also what has made them valuable and workable for consumers,
who are more willing to accept agreed regulations laid down for reasons of
safety or compatibility than rigid external directives which are often seen
as interfering with local custom and supply.
From small beginnings early in this century standards now cover not only the
full range of industrial products and services but newer areas of interest
and concern such as environmental management.
In each case, however, for standards to be accepted and effective, the
working committees of Iso have had to take into account differences in
climate and culture across developing and industrialised countries, and
different structures and overseeing authorities.
There is a reluctance to give up measures that have developed by custom and
culture, and Iso has had to be sensitive to this in order to succeed.
Iso's own name illustrates this. Derived from the Greek word meaning
'equal'. it was chosen because it was considered to be linguistically
neutral and can be used as an international common denominator by Iso
members in 107 countries. The full English title, International Organisation
for Standardisation, is deliberately not an acronym. All standards are
published in English and French and some also in Russian.
Iso has had to be equally impartial in devising a worldwide system for
measurement, a topic which is still the nub of its activities. Since it
published its first standard in 1951 with the title 'Standard reference
temperature for industrial length measurement', it has had to return many
times to a question that arises in many guises: how to create a consensus on
what should be measured, in what way, and to what standard.
The metric system is now enshrined in a 14-part Iso standard covering the
information needed for measurement in just about every field of business,
industry, education, science and technology. At the other end of the scale,
new standards in areas such as environmental management are still being
developed.
World Standards Day is being celebrated today by Iso, the IEC and the
International telecommunications union (ITU) with the slogan 'Standards and
the consumer: partners for a better world.' Its message is designed to
increase awareness of the consumer's part in standards.
'Safety standards protect life and property. Their application creates safer
homes and workplaces, and improves the quality of life for everyone,' the
chief officers of the three organisations argue.
'The net result of industry's use of international standards is a 'level
playing field' on which fair trade and competition can take place, to the
benefit of consumers and society in general.'
Standards, indeed, are doorways that enable goods to enter other countries,
and trade to take place, on equal terms. Japan is notably ready to adapt its
products to world markets.
'When the Japanese design for the world market, they certainly forget
themselves and the very specific needs of their home market,' observes Mr
Bill Moggridge, founder of the design consultancy Ideo.
'As international design consultants we have to come to grips with
international standards. They are a good guide to the burning issues in
safety, functionality, and so on. But we have to move away from standards
that are unfriendly to users but kind to computer chips and connectors. The
process of creating standards still lags behind the way that standards are
actually applied,' Mr Moggridge says.
The IEC, which was created in 1906 has a particular problem because of the
fast-moving nature of the industry in which it operates. However fast it
reacts to technology developments, the computer industry is always going to
be moving faster. The convergence of telephone, fax, computer, copier and
video in multimedia systems has led the IEC, Iso and ITU to warn that 'an
electronic jungle will result unless this exciting rush of developments is
channelled productively by international standards'.
Yet, according to Mr John Kean, vice-president of Iso for technical
management, developments in telecommunications will have the effect of
educating the consumer as never before. Mr Kean gives as an example the
interactive TV available to members of Canacintra, the largest Mexican
chamber of commerce, for industries involved in technological transfer.
'Their 38,000 members can hook into an interactive educational channel,
which deals with issues of manufacture, standards, and procedures. It is a
tool of tremendous potential,' he argues.
Indeed, electronic delivery of standards offers the easiest and swiftest
method yet of publishing and disseminating standards information. Multimedia
and interactive video promise to be seductive educational tools, which makes
international agreement on multimedia standards all the more urgent.
The CD-Rom has already been seized on as an ideal medium by IT experts and
others. CD-Rom is among the formats available from IHS, International
Handling Services, of Englewood, Colorado, which offers a library of the
world's most widely-referenced standards, plus an electronic inquiry
service.
In Britain, IT experts can look up standards on Bits, a PC disc 'Browser'
for IT standards published by the Information Technology Industry Training
Organisation.
Industry experts warn, however, that the electronics and software industries
are racing ahead at such a speed that they are vulnerable to de facto
standards.
These rely entirely on the weight of the user-base, and rarely settle on the
best possible technical solution.
This is a problem which world standards bodies are now having to address.
Despite 100 years or more of standard-making the challenges look like being
no less complex in the next century as an increasingly integrated world
trading environment - heavily dependent on information technology as its
engine - develops apace.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Property: Great expectations in Pretoria - South Africa's
market is poised for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DONALD NEWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With its immense natural resources and financial, professional and legal
infrastructure, South Africa is well placed to attract the foreign
investment needed to underpin President Nelson Mandela's ambitious programme
of economic revitalisation.
After three years of negligible growth, the economy is forecast to grow by
3.5 per cent this year; inflation has fallen to a 20-year low of 7 per cent,
before recently nudging up to 8.2 per cent.
Recent foreign corporate arrivals in South Africa include aircraft and car
manufacturer Deutsche Aerospace, insurer Irish Life and Swedish consumer
goods group Electrolux. There are great expectations of the tourism sector,
with some observers forecasting 12-20 per cent expansion over the next few
years. The number of tourists has increased sharply over the past three
years but still amounts to only 650,000 a year (compared with Kenya's 4m a
year).
All this increased business activity will benefit the commercial property
sector through additional demand for space. Ensuring an adequate supply of
high-quality commercial and industrial accommodation is therefore an
essential carrot with which to attract foreign companies.
Public-sector office space is also likely to increase significantly under
the government's development programme. Office demand in Johannesburg, the
commercial hub, and Pretoria, the capital, will be markedly affected by
government demand.
The property market's fortunes have reflected those of the broader economy,
bumping along the bottom of the cycle.
By world standards property prices in South Africa are cheap.
State-of-the-art offices are priced at Pounds 4.5-Pounds 6.3 per square
metre (compared with central London rates of Pounds 31.5 per sq m); retail
levels vary between Pounds 8-Pounds 19 per sq m and industrial property
averages at about Pounds 1.8 per sq m
Yields for office investments, at 10 per cent, are high by world standards -
yields in Dublin are 7 per cent, Amsterdam 7 per cent, Jakarta 8.5 per cent
and Chicago 8.5 per cent. Yields on industrials are between 11-12 per cent;
regional shopping centres yield between 9-10.5 per cent and community and
local shopping investments range between 10.5-12.5 per cent.
Vacancy rates for offices in central business districts are high. The
vacancy rate for grade A space - top of the market - in central Johannesburg
is 16 per cent (10 per cent in 1990) and in Durban 24 per cent (15 per cent
four years ago).
In Johannesburg, demand for US-style suburban shopping malls is growing. In
the suburb of Rosebank, for instance, which contains one of the city's
busiest malls, rent at a typical grade A building is about Pounds 6.3 per sq
m, while the vacancy is a low 2.5 per cent. Leases are usually for five or
10 years with an annual rent rise which last year averaged 12 per cent.
Along with the rest of the economy, the property sector is showing early
signs of recovery, a useful encouragement for foreigners contemplating
investment. At a recent auction of property in Durban, for instance, a
commercial property sold at 10 per cent more than the original reserve.
Among local institutional investors, Sanlam, Liberty Life and Old Mutual -
all insurers - are the most active. Old Mutual predicts that rentals will
double over the next 4-5 years.
Development activity is picking up too. Johannesburg Consolidated
Investments, a diversified industrial and mining group, is developing a
225,000 sq m building in the suburb of Sandton for Alexander Forbes
Consultants and Actuaries (part of Price Forbes insurance group).
Although it is too soon to identify firm trends, the boldest investors could
reap benefits by purchasing at this early stage. Many smaller investors,
however, are likely to be deterred from making direct property investments
because of the high capital requirements.
Such potential property investors may therefore take advantage of the
unusually high number of listed property unit trusts, a popular investment
instrument.
The trusts do not incur tax and distribute all their income to unit holders.
The income, however, incurs tax with the level determined by the unit
holder's individual tax status. The trusts offer a spread of risk by
geography and type of property. An average trust will typically yield about
12.5 per cent income return and capital growth potential is considered
promising.
'As about 90 per cent of the 14 listed property unit trusts are owned by
institutions, this sector is unlikely to slide,' said Mr Les Weil, executive
chairman of local property consultants J H Isaacs, and deputy president of
the South African Chamber of Business. 'This therefore creates a solid
investment vehicle for the smaller investors,' he added.
The idea of South African property-owning organisations setting up joint
ventures with foreign investors is also gaining currency. Whether joint
ventures take off will depend, in large part, on political stability.
President Mandela's pledges to deliver better housing, education, health and
jobs will form a vital ingredient to long-term political and economic
stability.
The generally optimistic business outlook is reflected in the chart, which
shows a rise in business confidence, particularly in the past 12 months. In
the same vein, J H Isaacs forecasts real gross fixed investment to grow by
5-7 per cent this year and 12-15 per cent in 1995, a trend that augers well
for the commercial property sector.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries surge on lower producer prices
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds surged forward yesterday on news of an unexpected slump in
producer prices last month.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  23/32 higher
at 96 3/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.833 per cent and the two-year note
was  1/8 better at 99 25/32 , to yield 6.601 per cent.
Although economists had expected yesterday's Labor Department report to
present no obstacle for bonds, few imagined the data would be as favourable
as it proved.
The September producer price index showed a surprising 0.5 per cent decline,
while the 'core' rate, which excludes the more volatile energy and food
sectors, was up by a more modest 0.1 per cent.
Analysts were forecasting a 0.1 per cent rise in the PPI and a 0.4 per cent
increase in core prices. The result in part reflected a 1.1 per cent
downturn in car prices, which were thought to have appreciated.
The inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range leapt nearly a point
on the news, with speculative retail accounts said to be leading the rally.
Prices receded a little mid-morning, pushed higher just before noon,then
settled back a little late in the day.
The improvement capped a week-long advance for bonds triggered by Friday's
announcement of a much smaller increase in employment in September than
economists had forecast. Yesterday's news reinforced suspicions that the
economy is not accelerating fast enough to warrant an immediate rise in
short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
*something in here (HP) *
However, the news on producer prices failed to chase away all the market's
bearishness. Gains were limited by the reluctance of many traders to make
commitments ahead of today's reports on consumer prices, retail sales and
industrial production.
The consensus forecast of a slight 0.2 per cent gain in consumer prices
appeared to be a safe bet, given the decline at the producer level. The
market was a little more edgy about the level of capacity utilisation at
factories and mines, a good indication of future inflationary trends. The
rate has hovered dangerously near the 85 per cent mark in recent months.
European government bond markets followed the rise in US Treasuries
yesterday, leaving dealers braced for the impact of today's data from the
US.
The US-inspired rally in the UK gilts market prompted the Bank of England to
decide to issue stock into the strength. The Bank said Pounds 200m of 8 1/2
per cent 2007, Pounds 250m of 8 per cent 2013, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per
cent index-linked due 2013 would be available.
News of this long-dated stock led some in the market to expect today's
announcement of auction stock to involve a short-dated issue, possibly a
five-year.
Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said the tone in the market had been
good. 'Inflation numbers are good and the action by the Bank on interest
rates looks more pre-emptive than it did at the time. People are starting to
say that even if inflation does go up, gilts are still good value.'
The December gilt future on Liffe rose  17/32 to 100 7/8 in late trading.
The yield spread over bunds widened slightly to around 129 in late trading.
German bunds also rose in line with the US. The December bund future was
around 90.29 in late trading, up 0.87 on the day. Mr Thomas Mayer at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt said a victory by Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the elections
on Sunday was now firmly priced into the market, and any other result would
come as a shock to bunds.
The Italian government's auction of a total of L5,000bn of bonds in three
tranches was covered between 2.31 and 3.46 times. Mr Corrado Costantino at
Williams de Broe in London said: 'The political situation is so unstable
that I don't think the international investor is willing to put money into
the Italian market.'

Framlington, the UK fund management group, yesterday announced the launch of
a closed-end fund which will invest in Egypt, one of the fastest-growing
emerging stock markets during the last year.
The New Egypt Fund, which is to raise between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m,
is one of a number of recent initiatives aiming to capitalise on
opportunities in North Africa and the Middle East, opened by liberalisation
and privatisation programmes.
New Egypt follows the launch last month of Framlington's Maghreb Fund, which

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Czechoslovak bank loan terms
set benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Czechoslovak bank has broken new ground for east European borrowers by
successfully obtaining a syndicated loan at a spread of less than 100 basis
points over London interbank rate.
A five-year loan of Dollars 50m for Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, the Czech
and Slovak foreign trade bank, has been heavily oversubscribed, arranger
Sumitomo Bank said.
Demand was strong in spite of the most aggressive pricing attempted by an
east European entity, at just 70 basis points above Libor with fees ranging
up to 35 basis points.
Despite initial market concern that the spread was too narrow, Sumitomo Bank
raised Dollars 120m and oversubscription was 140 per cent.
Chase Manhattan Bank, JP Morgan, Lloyds Bank, Midland Bank, Mitsubishi Trust
&amp; Banking Corp, and Tokai Bank joined the syndicate and acted as lead
managers.
Syndicated loan markets have seen an inflow of liquidity which has lowered
spreads for a typical European corporate borrower with a Single A rating
from 45 basis points to as low as 20. In the Czech case, the narrowing has
been faster.
Investors have digested the split of Czechoslovakia, and the Czech
Republic's economic indicators have continued to outperform those of other
former communist countries.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, upgraded the Czech National Bank,
the central bank, to Triple B plus in July this year.
A bond issue by CNB in March 1993, soon after Slovakia became independent,
was sold at a spread of 272 to 278 basis points over comparable US
Treasuries. Spreads fell to 120 basis points over Treasuries in an April
1994 issue by the City of Prague. The CSOB transaction, the first time a
Czech corporation has tapped the syndicated loan market, establishes a new
benchmark.
Other east European borrowers have been drawn to the syndicated loan market
but none has achieved the pricing of the Czech transactions.
Banks heavily oversubscribed a Dollars 100m syndicated loan by InvesTel, the
treasury arm of Hungarian telecommunications company Matav. The deal raised
Dollars 197m and banks were scaled back to Dollars 150m.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Belgium completes borrowing programme
with Y75bn offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market saw a large number of differently structured deals in a
variety of currencies yesterday, with a particularly heavy concentration in
the yen sector.
The Kingdom of Belgium's Y75bn of 10-year bonds was the market's main focus
of attention. The bonds were priced to yield 15 basis points over Japanese
government paper, and lead manager Nikko Europe reported strong demand from
central banks and institutional investors in Europe. However, it still
expects 75 to 80 per cent of the issue to be placed with Japanese investors.
The offering, which will be used to refinance the kingdom's existing yen
debt, completes Belgium's public borrowing programme for this year, an
official at the ministry of finance in Brussels said. However, the kingdom
will be looking to make a SFr200m private placement in the Swiss market
before the year-end, he added.
Nikko said that the 15 basis point spread represented a semi-annual yield of
4.9 per cent, the same as the Japanese long-term prime rate and the level at
which many Japanese institutional investors are prepared to commit funds to
the market.
'That has ensured the popularity of the deal in Japan,' a Nikko syndicate
official said. 'Japanese life insurance companies, still nervous about
buying foreign currency bonds, are indicating that they are going to be
strong buyers of euroyen,' he said.
Another syndicate manager said: 'The yen sector is one of the few markets
around the world where borrowers can successfully do a 10-year transaction.
Demand in the dollar and D-Mark sectors is limited to the five-year area or
less.'
In a highly-structured deal, Roche Financial Management, a subsidiary of
Roche, the Swiss health products group, launched Y100bn of equity-linked
bonds due May 2002. Proceeds will replace part of the Dollars 5bn short-term
funding used for the recent acquisition of Syntex, the US pharmaceuticals
company, Roche said.
Lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said this was the first equity-linked
eurobond denominated in yen issued for a corporate borrower.
In the floating-rate sterling sector, Birmingham Midshires, a UK building
society, launched Pounds 150m of five-year bonds with a coupon of 12 basis
points over three-month Libor. It is believed the proceeds were not swapped.
Joint lead manager UBS reported 'an encouraging trend in demand' away from
the traditional buyers of this type of paper, usually other banks and
building societies, towards offshore UK and other investment funds.

Foster's Brewing, the Australian beer group, is considering spending up to
ADollars 700m (USDollars 517m) on acquisitions, according to the company's
managing director Mr Ted Kunkel, writes Bruce Jacques.
Mr Kunkel told a business lunch in Brisbane the company was emerging from a

The proposed ADollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.35bn) float of NRMA, the Australian
motorists' and insurance co-operative, has been thrown into doubt by a
Federal Court ruling yesterday, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The court ruled in Sydney that a meeting of NRMA members to vote on the
float, scheduled for October 19, should be postponed indefinitely. It also
banned the NRMA from distributing more float prospectuses, describing this
as 'conduct which is misleading or deceptive'.
The ruling followed an action brought by dissident NRMA directors who object
to directions on the matter will be issued on October 25. The NRMA said it
would consider an appeal.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Underlying earnings at Enron
improve 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enron, the Houston-based natural gas company, reported a 28 per cent
improvement in underlying net earnings in the three months to September,
reports Richard Waters.
This was achieved in spite of a sharp decline in the price of natural gas
compared with a year ago.
Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman, said that the results stemmed in part from the
company's policy of 'substantially hedging our commodity price risk'.
They also reflected higher profits from asset sales, which added Dollars
11.3m to after-tax profits compared with a year before. Enron reported
after-tax profits of Dollars 96m on sales of Dollars 2bn, against Dollars
74.9m (before a deferred tax adjustment) on sales of Dollars 1.9bn a year
ago.
Earnings per share rose to 36 cents, from 30 cents in the 1993 quarter.
The best earnings advance came in Enron Oil and Gas, an 80 per cent-owned
subsidiary, where operating profits climbed nearly 33 per cent to Dollars
52.6m. The subsidiary cut back its gas production by a quarter compared with
a year before, but benefited from an increase in crude oil and condensate
production.

Incentive, the Swedish industrial and investment company controlled by the
Wallenberg family, plans to re-list part of the newly-acquired Cardo
investment group early next year, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in
Stockholm. Incentive bought Cardo for SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.14bn) in May
because it wanted to acquire its controlling 58 per cent voting stake in the
medical equipment specialist Gambro. The new Cardo will comprise most of the
investment group's other industrial operations, based on doors, pumps and
railway breaking systems. It has manufacturing and sales companies in 21
countries and 5,600 employees. Sales in 1994 are projected to reach
SKr5.4bn.
Mr Lennart Nilsson, president of Cardo, said: 'The new Cardo is a
streamlined industrial group with strong market positions within its
respective product areas. This creates a favourable base for further
expansion.'
Holders of shares and warrants in the old Cardo will have preferential
rights to subscribe for shares in the new company, and will gain a discount.
Incentive said it may retain an ownership interest.

<TEXT>
Inland Steel is on track to lift its operating profits by Dollars 200m this
year over the Dollars 28m it reported in 1993, Mr Robert Darnall, chairman,
indicated yesterday, writes Richard Waters.
His comment came as the US integrated steel producer reported net earnings
for the third quarter of Dollars 30.7m on sales of Dollars 1.13bn, up from
Dollars 17m on sales of Dollars 972m the year before, a period in which it
benefited from a Dollars 11m tax credit.
Inland's revival has come on the back of rising prices and a shift in its
product mix towards higher-value steel. Steel shipments this year are
running at 6 per cent above 1993's level, while revenues are up 15 per cent.
Earnings per share of 54 cents in the quarter, up from 25 cents a year
before, were in line with market expectations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The chairman of troubled Malaysian Airline System (MAS) will soon unveil
plans aimed at cutting costs and generating new business, particularly in
cargo services, officials said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
They said Mr Tajudin Ramli would announce alliances with other airlines to
increase flight frequencies, and expand the airline's cargo services. 'The
alliances will increase MAS frequencies to Europe and other regions and also
expand our services,' one official said.
Mr Tajudin, who made his mark in Malaysia's telecommunications sector, has
said previously that he planned to streamline the former state-run airline,
which is south-east Asia's largest carrier.
'MAS is a profitable company and will contribute some 3 per cent to the
Malaysian economy by the year 2000,' Mr Tajudin said yesterday.
He hinted that his plans for the airline focused on the cargo service,
saying it would benefit from Malaysia's rapid industrialisation and
increasing exports.
MAS made a profit of MDollars 8.43m (USDollars 3.29m) on turnover of
MDollars 4.01bn in the last financial year, helped by the sale of old
aircraft. The airline, with a fleet of some 90 aircraft, has also begun
leasing out its excess medium-range aircraft to regional carriers.

<TEXT>
Regulatory scrutiny of Eli Lilly's proposed Dollars 4bn takeover of PCS, a
drugs distributor, was extended yesterday for a further two weeks,
apparently signalling that the company and the Federal Trade Commission had
failed to reach agreement on the terms of the deal, writes Richard Waters in
New York.
The waiting period for approval of the transaction under US anti-trust
legislation had already been extended once.
In a statement after the market closed yesterday, Lilly said the review
would now be extended further, to October 27.
'Because of the complexity of the transaction, additional time is needed to
complete the ongoing discussions between Lilly and the FTC,' it said.
The regulators have been reported for some weeks to be taking a harder line
on the Lilly/PCS deal than on two similar takeovers of distributors by drug
manufacturers over the past year - Merck's acquisition of Medco Containment
Services and SmithKline Beecham's purchase of Diversified Pharmaceutical
Services. The earlier transactions received FTC approval.

<TEXT>
Mr Wallace McCain, 64, has been ousted as co-chief executive of McCain
Foods. His replacement, possibly an outsider, will be appointed soon, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
However, a bitter, decade-long struggle between Mr Wallace McCain and his
brother, Mr Harrison McCain, 66, over family succession at McCain Foods is
far from over.
Mr Harrison McCain said he would continue as sole chairman and chief
executive until a successor was appointed in the next week or so.
The two brothers have over the past 38 years built McCain Foods into a
frozen foods multinational with annual sales of USDollars 2.5bn. Each
controls 33.57 per cent of the company.
The McCain Foods family-controlled board, after a six-hour meeting in
Toronto, dismissed Mr Wallace McCain and appointed him non-executive
vice-chairman.
Later, he accused his brother of 'playing family politics and keeping the
board under his thumb'. He said he would pursue the lawsuit against his
brother and the company. He maintains that McCain Foods should be
restructured, headed by an outsider, and later taken public.
Mr Harrison McCain said the board's action 'provides a resolution of the
dispute among shareholders and opens the way for an orderly succession of
chief executive'.
Only Mr Wallace McCain's two sons, Scott and Michael, voted against his
dismissal at the board meeting. Neither of the brothers were at the meeting.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Reliance prepares international
debt issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reliance Industries, the Indian petrochemicals group, is drawing up plans to
launch an international debt securities issue as soon as government
regulations permit, Mr Anil Ambani, managing director, said in London.
To date, Reliance, which in 1992 became the first Indian company to offer
global depositary receipts, has confined its international fund-raising to
equity-related issues.
Lack of official approval for debt issues was a competitive constraint, Mr
Ambani said. 'You cannot ask Indian companies to become global while tying
up our arms and legs.'
Reliance's dependence on equity funding - net gearing is only 8 per cent -
has pushed up its cost of capital and forced it to seek projects with an
exceptionally high internal rate of return. Its current hurdle rate is 22
per cent in dollar terms. The addition of some debt funding, albeit
cautiously, to its balance sheet would help bring its cost of capital closer
to that of its main international competitors.
Mr Ambani said he did not expect government approval for corporate debt
issues before next year, but Reliance would be ready when it was granted. It
has already sought a confidential credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the
US credit rating agency.
Though Reliance's current capital programme is fully-funded, the group plans
to diversify within India and aims to raise overseas turnover to between 10
and 15 per cent of sales within the next three to four years, from 2 per
cent at present. This could involve the establishment of overseas
manufacturing plant, something which the govern-ment is starting to
encourage.
Reliance this week announced a 146 per cent increase in interim net profits
to Rs5.1bn (Dollars 162.5m), in spite of a slight slippage in gross margins
to 18.8 per cent from 19.4 per cent. This was blamed on a scheduled plant
shut-down.
Net profits were boosted by a sharp increase in investment income and a fall
in depreciation charges, to Rs1.3bn from Rs2.1bn. Depreciation is likely to
continue at a lower level, reflecting a change to Indian accounting rules,
allowing assets to be depreciated over their full economic life.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Redefining the boundaries of
expansion - With dominance in chemicals cemented, the group is diversifying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Indian prime minister Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao launched pro-market
economic reforms three years ago, Reliance Industries, the country's largest
company, was busy draining a 700-acre marsh on the coast north of Bombay.
Today, workmen are building a Rs50bn (Dollars 1.59bn) petrochemicals complex
on the site - India's largest single industrial investment and Indian
industry's biggest act of faith in Mr Rao's policies.
Reliance, which this week reported record interim sales and profits for the
six months to the end of September, has overtaken long-established groups
such as Tata Iron and Steel, the leading privately-owned steelmaker, as
India's biggest company.
Once its current expansion is complete, in about three years, it will rank
among the world's largest chemicals groups.
With its output of petrochemical products from Hazira and an older complex
at Patalganga, nearer Bombay, set to rise from 1.4m tonnes this year to 6m,
Reliance estimates it will become one of the top 10 makers of polyester, a
basic fibre for the artificial textiles industry.
It also expects to be the second largest manufacturer of paraxylene, an
intermediate chemical in making fibres, and the biggest producer of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a plastic.
Reliance is already planning its next stage of development - a Rs30bn
(Dollars 956.3m)investment in a third petrochemicals complex at Jamnagar,
inland from Hazira, where Reliance Petroleum, a 21 per cent-owned affiliate
company, is building a Rs76bn oil refinery.
The group is also diversifying from its core business in textiles and
chemicals into oil and gas production, power, telecommunications and
financial services.
The programme is particularly ambitious, given general caution about
investing in India. Reliance, however, is confident. 'We have faith in
India's future,' says Mr Anil Ambani, managing director.
Reliance has already moved some way towards its target of raising turnover
from Rs53.4bn last year to Rs120bn in three or four years. In the first six
months of the current financial year, sales rose 33 per cent to Rs33.9bn,
pushing net profits up 146 per cent to Rs5.1bn.
Reliance was founded in 1977 by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani, the chairman, who runs
the company with his sons Mr Anil Ambani and Mr Mukesh Ambani, also a
managing director. Mr Ambani senior, 62, started his working life as a
petrol pump attendant before setting up a business trading textiles.
From his early days, Mr Ambani relied on raising funds from outside
investors, tapping the stock market with repeated share offers and building
a group of 2.4m shareholders. In 1992, Reliance became the first Indian
company to tap the euromarkets, and has since made two further issues.
The group also holds the record for the largest domestic offering - a
Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for Reliance Petroleum, the associate
company which is building the Jamnagar refinery.
The raising and management of capital has become one of Reliance's greatest
strengths, earning it a reputation for paying as much attention to financial
operations as to its basic business. Along the way, it has occasionally
embroiled itself in controversy.
Reliance was named in last year's parliamentary report into the Rs40bn
Bombay securities market scandal. The company was accused of circumventing
rules governing the amount of credit a borrower can raise from banks by
discounting bills through non-bank finance companies to raise additional
money. Reliance denied breaking any rules.
Rivals also alleged the company benefited from Mr Dhirubhai Ambani's
friendship with politicians, including the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi, saying the
relationship was exploited to help securegovernment investment licences
essential for business expansion in the controlled economy in the years
before 1991.
Mr Anil Ambani says Reliance operated in the same environment as other
groups. 'People can say what they like. I don't think we gained any
particular advantage.' He says Reliance's growth after 1991, when
liberalisation began and the need for licences diminished, has been even
faster than before.
The Ambanis, who have retained a stake of about 30 per cent in Reliance
Industries, have relied for technology mainly on multinationals such as ICI
of the UK and Du Pont of the US. But maturity has bought its own expertise,
particularly in project management. It is also planning to build a research
and development centre near Bombay in partnership with an international
group.
Mr Anil Ambani believes it is important for Reliance to have up-to-date
technology to keep costs down and quality high. If India's import barriers
come down as expected, Reliance believes it will remain competitive with
international groups.
Its success has been based on sticking to one industry, starting with
textiles trading and integrating backwards into petrochemicals production.
This single-mindedness has distinguished Reliance from most other large
Indian groups, which have spread themselves over several industries. As a
result, Reliance enjoys better economies of scale than most of its domestic
rivals.
Nevertheless, Mr Ambani says it is time for the company to look outside its
core business, because it already dominates production in that area, and
there are limits to growth.
Reliance is the first private-sector Indian company to secure licences for
the development of oil and gas fields; it is bidding to build and operate
two power stations at a cost of Rs30bn, as well as developing captive power
stations at its plants; and it is considering a Rs200bn investment in
telecommunications.
The group is not worried by the thought venturing into telecommunications
and power, as these are new fields for all entrepreneurs, having only
recently been opened to private investment.
As Mr Dhirubhai Ambani told shareholders at the annual meeting this year:
'Economic liberalisation has given your company unprecedented freedom to set
new and even more ambitious goals and targets.'

<TEXT>
Transocean, the Norwegian drilling rig owner, has secured refinancing of its
fleet loans with an international syndicate of banks led by Den norske Bank
and Christiania Bank, Norway's two largest banks, writes Karen Fossli in
Oslo.
The Dollars 176m agreement is based on a five-year loan with an eight-year
repayment schedule and secures long-term financing for rig operations.
Transocean said the new repayment schedule had improved considerably,
reducing the group's average annual repayments to Dollars 21m a year from

In April, Transocean acquired Ross Offshore, a competitor - the refinancing
has allowed the two group's previous three loans to be incorporated into
one.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cimpor buys 51% of Mozambican
producer

Cimpor, Portugal's partially-privatised cement group, has acquired 51 per
cent of state-owned Cimentos de Mocambique, the southern African's country's
only cement producer, for Dollars 20m, writes Peter Wise in Lisbon.
Cimpor was chosen from several candidates, including South African groups,
who put forward proposals for the privatisation. Cimpor will back a Dollars
96m investment in the recovery of CM's three production plants over the next
10 years.
Cement production has been severely curtailed in Mozambique by 15 years of
civil war. The country, a former Portuguese colony, is to hold multi-party
elections on October 27.
Cimpor aims to raise CM's production capacity to 1.1bn tonnes a year and
produce about 870,000 tonnes a year by 2004. Cimpor is to nominate three
members of CM's five-member board.
Twenty per cent of Cimpor's capital was privatised in July. A further 20 to
25 per cent is to be sold on foreign stock exchanges followed by the sale of
another 20 to 30 per cent in Portugal.
Cimpor began a process of internationalisation in 1992 when it acquired 97.7
per cent of Spanish cement company Corporacion Noroeste.

Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based forest products company, reported a
third-quarter net loss of Dollars 31.7m, or Dollars 1.19 per share, despite
a dramatic rebound in the pulp and paper markets it serves.
In the third quarter of 1993, the company had a net loss of Dollars 24.2m or
91 cents per share.
Sales in this year's third quarter were nearly unchanged from a year ago at
Dollars 1bn. Much of the loss was attributed to a Dollars 27m one-time
charge linked to the sale of the company's Canadian subsidiary, Rainy River
Forest Products, and to high debt servicing costs.
On an operating basis, Boise Cascade earned Dollars 28.4m in the quarter, up
from Dollars 5.3m in last year's third quarter. Operating income for its
paper and paper products division rose to Dollars 2.2m from a year-ago loss
of Dollars 27.8m, while income from its office products division rose to
Dollars 10.7m from Dollars 8.3m last year.
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific said it earned Dollars 87m or 98 cents per
share in the third quarter, turning around a net loss of Dollars 36m or 42
cents per share last year. Operating profits rose to Dollars 348m in the
quarter, up from Dollars 214m.
Georgia-Pacific said its pulp-making operations returned a profit for the
first time in many quarters, earning Dollars 83m compared with a loss of
Dollars 10m a year ago.
Building products, Georgia Pacific's largest division, earned a record
Dollars 262m in the quarter, up from Dollars 210m last year. Third-quarter
sales for all divisions rose to Dollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3.0bn last year.
For the nine-month period, Georgia-Pacific earned Dollars 141m, or Dollars
1.59 per share, on sales of Dollars 9.4 bn, up from last year's Dollars 2m
or or 2 cents per share on sales of Dollars 9.1bn.
Louisiana-Pacific, the US forest products group, unveiled record
third-quarter earnings of Dollars 95.1m, or 86 cents a share, more than
double last year's Dollars 41.5m or 38 cents a share. Sales for the quarter
jumped to Dollars 818.4m from last year's Dollars 629.4m.
For the first nine months, the company reported earnings of Dollars 262.2m,
or Dollars 2.38, up from Dollars 194.9m, or Dollars 1.78.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Raytheon reports 22% increase in
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raytheon, the Massa-chusetts-based defence company best known for its
Patriot missile, produced record third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.45 a
share, an increase of 15 per cent.
On sales up 10 per cent for the quarter at Dollars 2.4bn, operating profits
rose 22 per cent at Dollars 273m. After lower non-operating income, net
profits were up 12 per cent at Dollars 192m. However, the results were seen
as disappointing, and the shares fell Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 63.
Mr Dennis Picard, chairman, said lower defence spending had led to a fall in
sales and profits in government business. But the non-defence businesses of
engineering, construction, aircraft and appliances all enjoyed a record
third quarter.
The company said that 51 per cent of its Dollars 6.9bn order backlog was
funded by the US government against 65 per cent a year ago. Over that
period, government orders fell 16 per cent and civilian orders rose 50 per
cent. Civilian orders received in the quarter included a Dollars 364m
contract for Acme Steel in Illinois and a Dollars 1bn-plus environmental
surveillance project in Brazil, won in competition with the French defence
group Thomson.
Total debt fell Dollars 350m to Dollars 639m, giving a debt-equity ratio of
14.9 per cent.
Loral, the acquisitive US defence company, produced a 39 per cent gain in
second-quarter earnings per share, or 25 per cent before non-recurring
items. Bernard Schwartz, chairman, said he now expected full-year net income
to rise by more than the previous forecast of 20 per cent, without further
acquisitions or the non-recurring gain.
Sales in the quarter rose 61 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn, reflecting the
acquisition of Federal Systems from January. Net income was up 42 per cent
at Dollars 66.3m, or by 27 per cent before the one-off gain of Dollars 6.9m.

<TEXT>
Walt Disney's motion pictures group has named Mr Chris McGurk as president,
effective immediately, writes our financial staff.
The company said that Mr McGurk would be responsible for the group's
business activities, as well as international theatrical distribution, film
acquisitions, Miramax films, Hollywood Records, Disney Theatrical
Productions and character voices and dubbing.
Mr McGurk was previously vice president and chief financial officer of the
studios. The company said the promotion was part of a restructuring of the
filmed entertainment division.
The studio's management has been in flux since Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg's
bitter departure as studio chief in August. Mr Katzenberg played a pivotal
part in Disney's success since the late 1980s, culminating in its latest
international hit, the animated film The Lion King, which is poised to
become one of the most successful films of all time.
Earlier this week it was announced that Mr Katzenberg is to join Mr David
Geffen, the billionaire music mogul, and Mr Steven Spielberg, the film
director, in a new entertainment company.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Carolco's future in doubt as
merger fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The future of the independent Hollywood studio Carolco Pictures remained in
doubt last night after the company abandoned its merger with the video and
music retailer Live Entertainment.
The collapse of the stock-swap merger, which comes just a week after Carolco
warned that severe liquidity problems threatened to force the studio's
closure, was prompted by the recent sharp decline in the value of both
companies' shares.
Since March 24, when the Dollars 15m merger was officially announced, Live's
share price has plummeted 50 per cent to Dollars 1 3/8 and Carolco's 61 per
cent to Dollars  7/32 . They fell so far that trading in the two stocks was
suspended by the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday because they no longer
met the exchange's minimum listing requirements.
Live said yesterday that it was seeking to list its stock on the Nasdaq
market.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Live shareholders were to receive
5.5 Carolco shares for every one Live share. At the time, a 'collar' was
built into the deal that was intended to keep the total value of the
transaction within certain limits if either company's share price fluctuated
wildly before the merger was completed.
The collar, however, failed when the value of the two stocks plunged in the
intervening months amid spiralling financial problems at both companies.
Of the two, Carolco's situation is the more desperate, and some industry
analysts believe the studio may be forced into bankruptcy soon.
Carolco is currently trying to salvage production on its Dollars 75m
action-adventure pirate film Cut-throat Island by selling its only other
film in production, Showgirls, to the MGM studio, and negotiating fresh
funding from its three foreign shareholders, Pioneer of Japan, Rizzoli of
Italy and Canal Plus of France.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record revenues help Whirlpool
to 40% advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Whirlpool, the US-based maker of washing machines and other home appliances,
saw a strong increase in earnings in its third quarter in spite of the cost
of investing in international expansion.
A big increase in profits from its US operations and a smaller increase in
profits from Europe helped the company report a 40 per cent rise in net
income to Dollars 98m in the three months to September.
This figure included a Dollars 15m gain on the recently-completed sale of
its minority stake in Matsushita Floor Care, a US vacuum cleaner
manufacturer. Leaving aside this and a small restructuring charge in Europe,
net income would have been 20 per cent ahead at Dollars 83m.
Shipment increases in all four of Whirlpool's main markets - North America,
Europe, Latin America and Asia - led to record revenues of Dollars 2.08bn,
up from Dollars 1.91bn last time. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.30, or
Dollars 1.10 excluding the exceptional gain, compared with 96 cents a year
earlier.
In North America, Whirlpool increased its prices in all product categories
and had to absorb further costs associated with the phase-out of
chlorofluorocarbons from refrigerator products. But by maintaining its
market share amid rapidly rising industry shipments, it increased operating
profits from Dollars 120m to Dollars 137m.
In Europe - a big market for Whirlpool since the completion of its Philips
Electronics acquisition three years ago - the company suffered lower margins
because of a shift in the sales mix towards cheaper appliances.
But shipment gains 'significantly better' than the industry average of 2 per
cent helped it achieve profits growth. with the reversal of Dollars
3m-Dollars 4m of warranty reserves now deemed unnecessary, it increased
operating profits from Dollars 40m to Dollars 49m.
Whirlpool added that it was about to announce across-the-board price
increases of about 3 per cent on its European products.
Total earnings from Latin America, though still relatively small, nearly
doubled because of the strong performance of the group's Brazilian
affiliates. Asia produced a 30 per cent increase in revenues but turned in a
loss.

Bank outlook

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The leading credit rating agencies differed yesterday on the implications
for Mitsubishi Bank's long-term creditworthiness of its purchase of a
majority stake in the troubled Nippon Trust Bank.
While Moody's immediately confirmed its long- and short-term ratings of Aa3
and Prime-1 respectively, Standard &amp; Poor's and IBCA, the European rating
agency, said they were reviewing the bank's long-term ratings in the light
of Wednesday's merger announcement.
S&amp;P and IBCA said they would look at the implications for Mitsubishi's asset
quality. Nippon Trust has a high proportion of non-performing loans and the
takeover comes on top of large scale write-offs by Mitsubishi of bad debts
on behalf of two other affiliates.
Moody's said it did not expect the merger to have a material impact on
Mitsubishi's capital levels.
S&amp;P said it was placing its AA-minus long-term senior debt rating and
A-1-plus short-term ratings under credit watch with negative implications.
IBCA placed its AA rating of the bank's long-term debt under rating watch,
but left its A1 plus short-term rating unchanged.

Goodyear, the US tyre maker, said it would report third-quarter earnings of
between 97 cents and Dollars 1 a share, a range which puts it in line with
most market forecasts.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, gave the projection in a speech to a meeting of
securities analysts. Sales to the end of September were more than 6 per cent
up on the Dollars 2.9bn of the 1993 period, he said.
The improvement in earnings per share, from 92 cents a year earlier, comes
against the background of rising rubber prices which had threatened to put
pressure on margins.
Separately, Goodyear said it would acquire a 60 per cent interest in a
manufacturing joint venture with Qingdao Gold Lion Hose, the largest
producer of automotive hose in China. The total investment for the joint
venture is valued at Dollars 20m, of which 60 per cent will come from
Goodyear.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Murdoch prepares for family
control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman,is planning to strengthen
the position of his children by ensuring that they will eventually control
all the family interests in the international media group.
The News Corp chairman told the magazine Business Review Weekly that he
planned to buy the 40 per cent of Cruden Investments, the family investment
vehicle, not already held by his immediate family.
Cruden owns about 32 per cent of News Corp - a stake now worth around
ADollars 4.83bn (USDollars 3.55bn).
Mr Murdoch plans to buy the 40 per cent back from members of the extended
Murdoch family over the next five to 10 years, although he declined to say
how this would be financed.
Mr Murdoch, in Australia for News Corp's forthcoming annual meeting, told
Business Review: 'The arrangement is confidential but it will lead to my
children's trusts eventually having 100 per cent of Cruden Investments.'
Although financial problems in recent years have led to a dilution of the
Cruden stake in News Corp, Mr Murdoch has always been keen to retain as much
control as possible and to pass on that control to his children.
He argued in the interview that without an effective controlling family
stake in News Corp, the company could not have been built to its current
size.
Asked which of his two daughters and two sons he would like to succeed him
Mr Murdoch, 63, is quoted as saying: 'I hope we can work it out between us.'
He added, however, that he would probably make a judgment about his
successor in about 20 years.
Mr Murdoch's 23-year-old son Lachlan, who was recently appointed general
manager of News Corp-owned Queensland Newspapers, was present at the
interview. He told the magazine that his father's successor could come from
inside or outside of the family and should be whomever was best for the
company.
Mr Murdoch also defended the controversial plans for a one-for-one issue of
limited voting shares.
'The News Corp shares will do just great and Australian people can buy their
voting shares and the Americans can buy limited-voting shares and get the
bigger dividend,' he said.
Earlier this week Mr Murdoch moved to make the preference shares more
attractive by ensuring that their holders would receive a dividend premium
of at least 20 per cent.
The new shares would also participate on the same basis as the ordinary
shares in any takeover bid for the company.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Enron, the Houston-based natural gas company, reported a 28 per cent
improvement in underlying net earnings in the three months to September, in
spite of a sharp decline in the natural gas price compared with a year ago.
Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman, said the results stemmed in part from the
company's policy of 'substantially hedging our commodity price risk'.
They also reflected higher profits from asset sales, which added Dollars
11.3m to after-tax profits compared with a year before.
Enron reported after-tax profits of Dollars 96m on sales of Dollars 2bn,
against Dollars 74.9m (before a deferred tax adjustment) on sales of Dollars
1.9bn. Earnings per share rose to 36 cents, from 30 cents in the 1993
quarter.
The best earnings advance came in Enron Oil and Gas, an 80 per cent-owned
subsidiary, where operating profits climbed nearly 33 per cent to Dollars
52.6m. It cut gas production by a quarter but benefited from an increase in
crude oil and condensate production.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inland Steel is on track to lift its operating profits by Dollars 200m this
year over the Dollars 28m it reported in 1993, Mr Robert Darnall, chairman,
indicated yesterday.
His comment came as the US integrated steel producer reported after-tax
earnings for the third quarter of Dollars 30.7m on sales of Dollars 1.13bn,
up from Dollars 17m on sales of Dollars 972m the year before, when it had
benefited from a Dollars 11m tax credit.
Inland's revival has come on the back of rising prices and a shift in its
product mix towards higher-value steel. Steel shipments this year are
running at 6 per cent above 1993's level, while revenues are up 15 per cent.
Earnings per share of 54 cents in the quarter (up from 25 cents a year
before) were in line with market expectations.

UK-based group which is fighting a hostile takeover bid.
The write-down comes on the heels of Laidlaw's recent commitment to sell its
interest to Attwoods' predator, Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston. A
Laidlaw official said the write-down was based on BFI's offer price of
Pounds 1.09 a share.
Laidlaw has been seeking a buyer for its Attwoods stake for more than a
year, but BFI has been the only taker to date.
The Attwoods charge, which follows a Dollars 102m write-down last year,
dented what the company otherwise described as a 'particularly strong'
fourth quarter.
Operating income more than doubled to Dollars 40.3m in the three months to
August 31 from Dollars 17.5m a year earlier.
But a net loss was posted of Dollars 3.1m, or one cent per share, including
one-time charges, compared with a Dollars 334.9m loss, or Dollars 1.21 a
share.
Excluding special charges, earnings rose to 5 cents a share from one cent a
year ago.
Laidlaw no longer includes equity contributions from its 24 per cent stake
in ADT, the international security services and vehicle auction group, since
issuing a series of convertible debentures last December which can be repaid
in ADT shares.
Revenues rose to Dollars 482.6m from Dollars 467.5m.
Laidlaw's recent move into the US ambulance market contributed to a recovery
in income from passenger services to Dollars 3.8m, from a Dollars 3.6m loss.
Income from Solid-waste operations climbed to Dollars 23.7m from Dollars
12.7m.
Mr Jim Bullock, chief executive, forecast a further improvement in the
coming year, based on an increasing pace of acquisitions and rising earnings
from existing businesses.

Strong US and European demand for fabricated products, better pricing and
more rationalisation moved Alcan Aluminium, the Canadian aluminium group,
firmly into the black for the third quarter and first nine months.
Third-quarter net profit was USDollars 66m, or 27 cents a common share,
against a loss of Dollars 13m, or 8 cents, a year earlier. The quarter
included a special after-tax gain of Dollars 27m mainly on the sale of Alcan
Australia.
Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, up 21 per cent.
Nine months' net profit was Dollars 48m, or 15 cents, against a loss of
Dollars 68m, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 6.1bn, up 12
per cent.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Long haul ahead for Canadian
railways - A spate of US mergers has increased pressure on CN and CP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The harsh realities of the North American transport business are catching up
fast with the Canadian National Railway System.
Hobbled for years by regulators and trade unions, CN is the federal
government's biggest crown corporation and has a reputation as one of
Canada's most bureaucratic organisations.
It lost CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 820m) between 1991 and 1993 and is weighed
down by debts of almost CDollars 2bn.
However, recent events have cleared the way for the biggest upheaval in CN's
75-year history. Its main rival, the investor-owned Canadian Pacific, has
offered to pay CDollars 1.4bn for CN's rail operations east of Winnipeg and
Chicago.
In response to the CP bid, the government has set up a parliamentary task
force to investigate the 'commercialisation' (privatisation) of CN. The
committee will hold hearings across the country and is due to report before
the end of the year.
In the meantime the two men who will probably play the most decisive role in
deciding CN's future have indicated that they favour radical change.
'The time has come for a decision,' Mr Doug Young, transport minister, said
last month. 'We have to face today's economic realities and ensure that over
the long term CN becomes a competitive and efficient operation.' Mr Paul
Tellier, CN's chief executive, said in a speech earlier this year that 'the
train is still seen as a symbol of our country's glorious past. But we must
focus on measures to develop its full potential.'
The background to the CP offer and the hint of privatisation is CN's
inability to keep pace with the fierce competition and aggressive
cost-cutting which have marked the recent history of North American
railways.
Canadian railways' share of domestic goods traffic has dropped from 70 per
cent to 28 per cent since the early 1960s as more shippers have turned to
road and air transport.
The story is different in the US, where the railways carry more than
two-thirds of the container traffic from the Far East to central Canada, and
have more traffic per kilometre of track and per employee than CN or CP.
They also benefit from more friendly government policies and a more
co-operative workforce. All in all, says Mr Tellier, it costs CDollars
10,000 more to run a train from Vancouver to Toronto than from Seattle to
Chicago.
US railways are far ahead of Canada in adopting more flexible labour
practices, such as switching from three-man to two-man train crews.
Mr James Higgins, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, says that
Canada's powerful rail unions and antiquated labour practices are likely to
discourage any US railway from making a bid for either CN or CP.
A spate of mergers among US railways is likely to put even more pressure on
the Canadian companies. In one such move, Conrail and Norfolk Southern are
reported to be negotiating a merger that would form a regional railway
criss-crossing the eastern half of the US. Such an arrangement would worry
the Canadian railways, whose main markets are also in the north-east of the
continent.
The two Canadian companies have launched a series of initiatives in an
attempt to make themselves more attractive to shippers, especially foreign
ones who have a choice between channelling their goods through a US or a
Canadian port.
CN is building a CDollars 200m tunnel under the St Clair River between
Ontario and Michigan which will accommodate double-stack container trains
and cut 12 hours off the journey from Toronto or Montreal to Chicago.
It has also forged marketing and operating alliances with US railways and
trucking companies.
But Mr Tellier has indicated that his top priorities are to improve
productivity and to find a solution for the loss-making eastern Canadian
operations.
Others have begun to question whether Canada can afford the luxury of two
national railways whose lines run virtually side by side in some parts of
the country. CN and CP have lost almost CDollars 2bn combined on their
eastern operations over the past five years.
CN's eastern network contributes about 47 per cent of its revenues, but
almost all its profits come from western Canada, where the bulk goods which
make up most of its traffic - such as coal, grain and sulphur - are less
suited to competition from trucks.
CN's plans have provoked strong opposition from trade unions, which face
extensive job cuts and demands for more flexible work practices. One union
representing more than a third of CN's 23,000 unionised workers is on the
point of calling a strike following a breakdown in contract talks.
CN's railway operations have recently returned to profitability, with
second-quarter net earnings of CDollars 113m. This has led the unions to
claim that the company's problems are largely over, but management counters
that the improvement is due solely to the economic upturn and the company is
still constrained by structural problems.
It will soon be up to the government to choose which side has the stronger
argument.

sharp fall

<TEXT>
Net income at CBS, the US television broadcasting network, plunged 51 per
cent in the third quarter. The company, which is regarded as a takeover
candidate after the failure of its proposed merger with the QVC home
shopping group in June, blamed the fall mainly on a higher tax charge and
the absence of one-off gains.
However, sales were down because of the absence of professional football and
baseball coverage this year. CBS lost the rights to both last year, being
outbid for professional football by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The
major league baseball season was cancelled this year by a players' strike.
Results were affected by higher costs for prime-time film showings, lower
ratings for day-time programmes and lower syndication sales, the company
said. However, Mr Lawrence Tisch, chairman, said operating results from the
company's own TV and radio stations were higher as a result of strong local
advertising expenditure.
Sales fell 4 per cent for the quarter to Dollars 726m while pre-tax profit
was down 44 per cent at Dollars 82.3m. Adjusting for a one-off legal
settlement from Viacom last year, the underlying fall was 30 per cent. After
a tax charge of 29 per cent compared to 19 per cent, net income was Dollars
58.4m against Dollars 118.2m, or 77 cents a share compared with Dollars
1.48.
The quarterly dividend was held at 10 cents.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Amer set to expand sporting
goods side in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wielding a tennis racquet specially designed for Steffi Graf and calling on
an assistant to bring in one of his company's Michael Jordan basketballs, Mr
Seppo Ahonen, chief executive of Amer, yesterday declared that the
diversified Finnish group, which owns the Wilson sports equipment brand, was
set to concentrate increasingly on sporting and leisure goods.
Amer, an oddly-shaped company that combines sports equipment with car sales,
tobacco processing and printing and publishing, announced a three-fold rise
in pre-tax profits in the first eight months of the year to FM135m (Dollars
28.3m) from FM43m in the same period last year. Earnings per share rose to
FM5.40 from FM1.90.
Sales were down 5 per cent to FM4.83bn from FM5.07bn and are set to fall
over the full year. But this was blamed on exchange rate fluctuations and
the sale this year of Amer's paper operations.
Mr Ahonen predicted a 'significant improvement' in full-year profits over
last year's pre-tax surplus of FM120m and said Amer was well placed to push
ahead with its strategic shift towards sporting and leisure products.
'In future we will focus and expand in that area,' he said. 'Every other
part of the business is making a profit today. But none is our core business
and if we get good offers to buy, we would consider them.'
Mr Ahonen said he was looking for organic growth in the sporting goods
division, which accounts for 48 per cent of group sales and is dominated by
Wilson. But Amer, which has driven its equity ratio up from 27 per cent two
years ago to 42 per cent today, would also consider growth by acquisition.
'Our balance sheet is now at the stage where we can start to look at
acquisitions, but we are not in a hurry.'
Mr Ahonen was brought into Amer from the telecommunications group Nokia two
years ago to pull the company out of losses. Just as Nokia has moved in a
few years from being a widely diversified group to focusing on mobile and
fixed telephony, Mr Ahonen is reshaping Amer. It started life as a tobacco
processor and by the early 1990s was a sprawling conglomerate.
The group still includes a division which sells Toyota, Citroen and Suzuki
vehicles in Finland, a franchise to make Philip Morris cigarettes for the
Finnish market and printing and publishing businesses. But Mr Ahonen quickly
identified the sports division as the focus of future strategy.
Amer acquired Wilson and the MacGregor Golf Company in the mid-1980s. The
prestigious labels have given Amer leading or second ranking positions in
the US markets for tennis racquets, golf equipment, American footballs,
baseball equipment and basketballs.
In the first eight months, sporting goods sales fell slightly to FM2.32bn,
hit by a sharp fall in tennis racquet sales and exchange rate changes. But
Amer said profitability and market share improved.
Mr Ahonen said he wanted to strengthen the sporting goods penetration in
Florida and on the US west coast and in Europe and Japan.
He also was seeking to expand Amer's product range beyond the summer sports
in which it is strongest and was looking for opportunities in non-team and
non-competitive sports areas, such as camping and fishing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Havas, the French media and leisure group, yesterday announced first-half
net profits of FFr589m (Dollars 111.3m), an increase of almost 40 per cent
over the same period in 1993.
The company forecast a strong increase in full-year results on the back of
rationalisation measures implemented in 1992 and 1993 and recovery in its
principal markets. Last year, the company recorded net profits of FFr708m.
The net figure for the first half was boosted by increased stakes in some
subsidiaries. Havas raised its holding in ODA, the advertising arm of France
Telecom's directories, to 100 per cent and its stake in CEP communications
to 45.3 per cent. Stripping out this factor, first-half net profits rose 30
per cent.
Half-year turnover was 26 per cent up at FFr18.9bn. On a pro-forma basis,
the gain was 8.1 per cent compared with the 1993 first half. Just over
one-third of turnover came from markets outside France.
Consolidated investments during the period amounted to FFr2.35bn, about half
of which represented the acquisition of 50 per cent of the shares of ODA.
Cashflow rose to FFr771m, a rise of 26 per cent over the comparable period.

<TEXT>
Norske Skog, the Norwegian pulp, paper and building materials producer,
yesterday reported a sharp rise in pre-tax profit to NKr92m (Dollars 13.7m)
in the first eight months, compared with NKr9m in the same period last year.
The improvement was attributed to increased production and higher prices for
pulp and building materials.
Group sales advanced to NKr5.7bn from NKr4.9bn as operating profit increased
more than four-fold to NKr387m from NKr93m. Norske Skog said demand for its
products had made it possible to increase prices for pulp, building products
and special grades of paper. However, prices for newsprint and magazine
paper - normally sold under contracts of one year duration - could not be
raised before next January.
'If they are increased, it will be the first rise since the price decline of
about 30 per cent in 1991-92,' Norske Skog said.
The group charged accounts with financial items of NKr216m against a NKr7m
gain in the same period last year. Included in the figures is a loss of
NKr123 on the bond portfolio, against a gain of NKr220m last year. For the
individual business units, fibre lifted sales to NKr887m from NKr661 and
returned an operating profit of NKr37m against a loss of NKr145m last year.
Paper increased sales by NKr520m to NKr3.7bn as operating profit rose by
NKr67m to NKr308m. Building materials saw sales rise by NKr89m to NKr1.25bn
as operating profit more than doubled to NKr80m from NKr33m.
Norske Skog expects a stable profit trend during this year's final period.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JP Morgan, the US bank, reported a 30 per cent slide in third-quarter
after-tax profits from the record level of a year before.
Weaker profits from trading in financial markets, a steep fall-off in
underwriting fees and a loss on foreign government bonds held as investments
were behind the decline.
The fall-off in earnings at JP Morgan, while in line with market
expectations, highlights the continuing difficult trading conditions in
financial markets around the world. The volatile and unexpected price
movements of the first half of the year, particularly in worldwide bond
markets, have given way to thin and erratic trading in more recent months.
Sir Dennis Weatherstone, who steps down as chairman of the US bank at the
end of this year, said market conditions continued to be difficult in the
latest period, but he was pleased with the bank's overall performance.
The biggest dent to JP Morgan's earnings came from a decline in trading
revenues to Dollars 282m from Dollars 464m the year before. This was,
however, an improvement on the Dollars 228m of the second three months of
1994. The greatest contributions to profit came from swaps and bonds,
particularly in the emerging markets. Earlier this year, losses in the
emerging markets had been a significant factor in the decline in trading
profits.
The bank's trading revenues so far this year are running 40 per cent below
their level of 1993, when soaring bond markets bolstered the profits of many
commercial and investment banks.
Movements in the financial markets also led Morgan to report a net
investment loss of Dollars 27m, principally resulting from the sale of
non-US government bonds. A year before, it had reported investment gains of
Dollars 98m.
However, trading in interest-rate instruments added Dollars 73m to the
bank's net interest income, up from Dollars 10m the previous year. Largely
as a result, net interest income was up 20 per cent at Dollars 526m.
The uncertainties in financial markets also hit Morgan's underwriting fees
in the three months to the end of September: these totalled Dollars 22m,
down from Dollars 56m a year before. As a result, corporate finance fees as
a whole dropped by 23 per cent, to Dollars 108m.
Overall, non-interest income dropped by almost a quarter, to Dollars 906m.
With expenses growing by 7 per cent, due largely to higher staffing levels,
the bank's net profits fell to Dollars 327m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, from
Dollars 468m or Dollars 2.30 a year before.

<TEXT>
Metra, the Finnish industrial group, yesterday lowered its 1994 forecast
after a 17 per cent slump in profits after financial items in the first
eight months.
The change, which came despite increased momentum in the second four months,
means it expects full-year profits to be in line with 1993's FM472m (Dollars
99m), rather than higher.
The company said its Abloy security division had not performed as well as
expected earlier this year.
It also noted that Wartsila Diesel, its biggest unit, had been hit by
project postponements and engine line development costs.
The fall in interim profits to FM224m from FM270m followed a drop in net
sales to FM7.1bn from FM8.4bn. Last year's figure was distorted by
Wartsila's exceptionally strong performance in early 1993.
Group operating profit was down sharply at FM393m from FM529m, but the
impact was cushioned by a FM88m fall in financial expenses to FM189m.
Wartsila, one of the world's leading manufacturers of diesel power
generators, saw sales fall 21 per cent to FM3.7bn.
But its order book has grown from FM3.5bn to FM4bn since the beginning of
the year.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft puts its
defence for futures debacle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When academics and businessmen lock horns, the clash can be deafening - even
if the dispute is over the esoterica of futures and derivatives.
Attention is virtually guaranteed when the subject is Metallgesellschaft,
the one-time German stock market favourite which almost came to grief this
year as a result of controversial oil dealings.
To defend itself against charges that it mishandled the unwinding of its oil
contracts and precipitated an even bigger loss than might otherwise have
occurred, the industrial and trading company held a press conference on
Wednesday night to put its case.
It said losses on the complex oil contracts - in which derivatives (mostly
futures) were used to hedge long-term fixed price contracts - could have
jeopardised the future of the whole company. It claimed Mr Merton Miller, a
Nobel prize-winning economics professor, and his co-writer, Mr Christopher
Culp (a doctoral candidate at Chicago University), had not grasped how much
of a crisis faced the company.
Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of Metallgesellschaft Ltd in the UK
and a member of the risk management team sent to sort out the US problems,
said: 'We're happy with what we've done and will remain happy with what
we've done.' The unwinding was done 'in a way that alleviated the
existence-threatening condition that the massive position had created'.
If the futures contracts entered into by the US oil trading subsidiary (MG
Refining &amp; Marketing) had not been unwound, monthly losses on rolling them
forward would have reached Dollars 50m last December. Contango losses
(caused by futures prices being at a premium over spot prices) alone had
risen to between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m a month in the last quarter.
The company's oil futures position totalled 180m barrels, more than the 160m
usually quoted, he added. This was equivalent to 85 days of Kuwait's oil
output. Nor were the contango losses offset by any corresponding gains on
MGR&amp;M's futures contracts with customers.
There were further losses of 'hundreds of millions of dollars' through lower
oil prices and consequent margin calls. In New York, Metallgesellschaft said
it paid Dollars 900m in margin calls on oil hedges in 1993. The result of
the debacle was that creditor banks led by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank
mounted a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.2bn) rescue package to save the company.
Quite how Metallgesellschaft fell into this mess is still unclear. Since it
is the subject of pending legal action, Mr Hutchinson and Mr Hans-Werner
Nolting, the director responsible for trading, said much of the detail had
to stay confidential. They declined to state the size of the present oil
trading position.
The legal wrangle concerns a Dollars 1bn compensation claim by Mr Arthur
Benson, former senior executive at MGR&amp;M, for damage to his reputation
caused by his sacking after the oil losses. Hearings start today in a
Baltimore court on whether this should go to arbitration or be decided in
court.
The nub of the argument by Mr Miller and Mr Culp is that the futures
transactions would eventually have produced profits if they had been kept
going until oil prices rose again. They say, in the draft of an unpublished
article, that a bad situation was made worse by unwinding the contracts too
quickly.
Metallgesellschaft disputes this and says the authors have changed some of
their opinions in a new article out shortly. 'Where Miller and Culp go wrong
is in moving from theory to reality,' said Mr Hutchinson. 'The authors
incorrectly assume that all of MGR&amp;M's long-term supply contracts obligated
the customer to take and pay for at least rateable (in equal amounts)
monthly deliveries.' In fact, a large number of the contracts did not oblige
customers to take any oil products or make payments until almost 10 years
ahead; such flexible contracts running for up to 10 years totalled 50m
barrels.
None of MGR&amp;M's competitors ran 10-year contracts, Mr Nolting said. So when
the full story of how these came about emerges, it should be a fascinating
and salutary saga of how a company supposedly experienced in commodities
trading could come so unstuck. Until then, outsiders can only look on with
bemusement and schadenfreude; investors are left to ponder the value of a
company whose shares languished yesterday at DM163 against DM365 a year ago.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: MAN signals fundraising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MAN, the engineering and commercial vehicles group, yesterday signalled its
intention of raising its capital by DM300m (Dollars 193.5m) over the next
five years.
The company said its supervisory board had given management permission to
seek shareholders' approval for a rights issue any time up until 1999.
However, it was unable to say when the company would raise its nominal
capital or what the money would be spent on.
The Munich-based group has been badly hit by Germany's worst recession since
the second world war. Profits fell 30 per cent last year to DM160m, but the
company insisted it was now reaping the benefits of far-reaching
restructuring over the past two years.
Group sales rose 2 per cent to DM3.32 in the first quarter of this year,
which began on July 1, while orders rose 25 per cent to DM4.7bn. Foreign
orders rose 28 per cent to DM3bn while domestic orders, which lagged exports
last year, picked up 21 per cent to DM1.7bn.
The improvement in sales was attributed to better performances in the
commercial vehicles and engineering divisions, which together make up just
over 80 per cent of group turnover.
However, the company said it hoped to boost sales further with its new
Roland sheet fed printing presses, and the new range of trucks including the
L2000 and the F2000 models.
MAN is the second biggest German truck manufacturer after Mercedes-Benz. The
company has predicted that truck sales in Germany are expected to fall until
the end of this year and will pick up in 1995 as the German economy
recovers.
Like other German companies, MAN is finding it difficult to improve its
market share because of high labour costs in Germany. The company has said
it will try to keep its truck and bus production in Germany, but there are
rumours that it may transfer at least some of it to a Turkish company in
which it holds a stake.

FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: CU spells out its Victoire
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, yesterday refused to
rule out job cuts at Groupe Victoire, one of France's largest insurers which
it bought this summer.
Mr Tony Wyand, the new president appointed by CU to Victoire's board, said
he aimed to keep administrative costs as a proportion of turnover on a
continued downward trend.
Mr Wyand indicated that job losses were likely to be in the order of a few
percentage points, and that Victoire was already a 'well-run and efficient
company'.
Mr Bernard Pottier, vice-president, said: 'We will do what proves to be
necessary.' He stressed that the main emphasis was to increase the
connections between different parts of the group.
This would include a reduction in the need for analysts and administrators,
and the imposition of CU's style of monthly reporting, in contrast to the
annual systems in operation at Victoire.
CU revealed that the Victoire name would also become of diminishing
importance, with the holding company for the French operations being
retitled Commercial Union France.
However, Mr Wyand stressed that the subsidiaries would continue to trade
under their existing names, including Abeille Vie and L'Epargne de France.
He said Victoire would probably remain the name for the group's asset
management arm.
The strategy for CU's operations in France would be in line with those of
the group elsewhere: with profitability after tax equivalent to at least 8
per cent on capital invested above inflation.
CU's broader objectives, he said, were to increase the proportion of life
insurance, develop its activities in Europe and improve the quality and
profitability of its casualty business.
The exact price of the CU purchase of Victoire will be determined in
December.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: British Steel to spend Pounds 97m on US
mini-mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel yesterday announced its biggest single investment project for
four years with a plan to spend Pounds 97m building a 1m-ton-a-year plate
mini-mill at Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary.
The plan, which has been under consideration for several months, is the
strongest evidence yet of British Steel's more expansionist investment
policy after years of restricted spending during the recession.
It will also mark the first time the company has made steel in a
wholly-owned overseas plant. Tuscaloosa is currently a rolling mill, using
slabs of steel - the raw material for plates - supplied mainly from Teesside
and Port Talbot.
Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the
expansion was designed to create an internationally competitive mini-mill to
produce quality plate in coil and cut-length form.
'Tuscaloosa's objective is to become the most cost-effective supplier in the
US plate market, and this investment is an important step forward in British
Steel's overseas expansion plans,' he said.
Tuscaloosa produces about 500,000 tons a year of steel plate, with annual
sales of about Dollars 190m (Pounds 120.2m).
Employment will rise from 290 to about 420 when the expanded plant starts
operating in late 1996.
The expansion will allow Tuscaloosa to produce wider, thicker plate, serving
a broader range of applications.
Industry experts praised the move. Dr Rod Beddows, chairman of Beddows &amp; Co,
the international consultancy, said it was potentially profitable. The
mini-mill would be able to offer a higher-quality, lower-cost product than
conventionally produced plate.
Tuscaloosa uses 250,000 tons of slabs a year. British Steel said there were
no job implications for UK steelworks from the future loss of business.

The businesses operate from a site in Stratford which is 80 per cent devoted

In the year to the end of August the businesses contributed Pounds 3.1m to

Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, yesterday walked
away from the UK's baked bean price war, which has seen supermarkets selling
own-label beans for 7p a can or less.
It has sold part of Stratford-upon-Avon Foods and part of Rowats Foods to
Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group, for Pounds
37.1m.
The businesses operate from a site in Stratford which is 80 per cent devoted

sector.
The site also cans fruit and vegetables and bottles pickles, mainly for own
label. In the year to the end of August the businesses contributed Pounds
3.1m to pre-tax profits on turnover of Pounds 39.2m.
Mr Stephen Walls, chairman, said the baked bean market had been very
difficult for a couple of years, and the market for pickles had been equally
tough. 'We thought the business would be far better off in the hands of a
larger player in the canning sector,' he said.
The disposal was in line with his strategy of concentrating on value-added,
high quality products and growth markets where the group could take a
leading position.
The shares closed 4p ahead at 48p.
The board plans to use the proceeds to continue the development of the
group, but in the short term it will cut debt.
Mr David Johnson, chairman, president and chief executive of Campbell Soup
in the US, described the acquisition as 'strategic', opening the way for
Campbell to grow in the UK by building on its core competency of heat
processed foods.
City analysts suggested yesterday that Fisher had got a good price for the
businesses. Profits at the group - due to report its annual results next
Thursday - are forecast at about Pounds 40m, excluding exceptionals.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Proteus may develop BSE test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Proteus International rose 7p to 140p yesterday after the
biotechnology company announced it was close to developing a diagnostic test
for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, in live cattle.
The company said its test confirmed the BSE diagnosis in a sample of 169
dead cattle brains and suggested it could be used in other body organs, and
blood, to provide a test for use on live animals.
Mr Jurek Sikorski, Proteus' business development and marketing director,
said it was in talks with an animal health company about developing,
manufacturing and marketing the test, which it expects to be available by
1997.
The potential market for a BSE test for live cattle and carcasses destined
for human consumption is estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) in Europe.
There is currently no test for BSE on live cattle. About 5 per cent of
suspected animals destroyed are found, on post mortem, not to have it.
The incidence of BSE has fallen dramatically this year and farmers are
hoping it will be virtually wiped out by the end of the decade.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pearson pays Pounds 16m for The Register
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media and entertainment company which owns the Financial Times,
has paid Pounds 16m for The Register Group, which monitors television and
newspaper advertising around the world and advertising expenditure in
Europe.
The Register, which in 1993 made an operating profit of Pounds 1.4m on
turnover of Pounds 12.9m, was once part of the AGB group of market research
companies. It was bought from administrators to the collapsed empire of the
late Mr Robert Maxwell by a team led by Mr John Gordon, backed by Apax
Venture Capital.
Mr Gordon, who will remain managing director, said yesterday that he
preferred Pearson as the buyer because of the opportunities within a larger
group.
In the short-term the company, which employs 380 people, will be part of the
Financial Times Group before moving to Pearson Professional grouping, which
will begin operations on January 1.
One of The Register's main activities is to provide examples of television
and print advertisements, often by market sector, from around the world. The
company also provides market information on expenditure - at rate card level
which does not include discounts - across Europe. In addition there is
broadcast monitoring services, mainly transcripts, for the UK.
The company expects to move to on-line provision of information and develop
the use of CD-Roms.
Pearson Professional's strategy is to offer a range of publications and
services to meet the needs of sectors ranging from the media, health and
finance to law, energy and telecommunications.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: David Brown warns on margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Brown Group, the Yorkshire-based specialist engineer which came to the
market last year, yesterday reported strong growth in sales and exports, but
warned that scope for margin improvement was limited.
The shares, which had fallen steeply ahead of the announcement, closed 13p
up at 213p.
Pre-tax profits rose 22 per cent to Pounds 6.04m for the six months to July
29. Sales grew 59 per cent to Pounds 59.7m - thanks partly to a full
contribution from the hydraulics and transmissions division of Hamworthy,
bought from Powell Duffryn for Pounds 11.1m last November,
Mr Chris Cook, joint chief executive, said margins had been squeezed by
tough trading conditions and the absorption of the less profitable Hamworthy
businesses, although they were now all trading profitably and ahead of
budget.
Mr Cook said the group had responded to the dearth of UK capital projects by
improving its overseas sales and distribution efforts. Partly because of the
Hamworthy deal, the proportion of group sales made overseas increased from
36 to 54 per cent.
Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, said: 'With our success in developing export
sales and each of the divisions currentlyshowing an order book higher than
12 months ago, the outlook for sales growth is becoming more encouraging.'
The closure of the Hamworthy plant in Poole, Dorset, involved 170
redundancies, but Mr Cook said he hoped further integration would be
achieved without further job losses.
Vehicle transmissions, the biggest division, showed substantial growth in
sales and operating profit following the integration of the Hamworthy axles
and rail gearbox businesses, together with a strong performance from the
recently developed specialist commercial vehicle activities.
Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executive, said the recent confirmation by the
Ministry of Defence that it would buy a further 259 Challenger 2 tanks from
Vickers meant that David Brown's military products business would be making
transmissions for the tanks until 1999.
Earnings per share rose 3 per cent to 6.7p (6.5p). Mr Cook said the earnings
increase would have been 7 per cent, but for a Pounds 250,000 bad debt
incurred following the collapse of Lancer Boss. The interim dividend is
lifted to 2.25p (2.1p).

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest reduces loss to Pounds 296,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbeycrest, the jewellery manufacturer, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds
345,000 to Pounds 296,000 in the first half of this year and was in the
black at the operating level.
Turnover grew to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 16.5m), with all sectors of the
group's business increasing sales, and operating profits emerged at Pounds
18,000 (losses Pounds 135,000). Abbeycrest's results are heavily biased
towards the second half.
Losses per share were 0.9p (1p) and the interim dividend is maintained at
1.2p.
Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said he was pleased that last year's progress
had continued, though he added that, as had been the case in previous years,
'it is the next 10 weeks that are crucial to the final result'.
He said that Abbeycrest had lifted its market share in a 'relatively flat,
highly competitive market'.
Margins were maintained, he added, through product strength and marketing
initiatives.
The pre-tax deficit occurred after increased net interest charges of Pounds
314,000 (Pounds 210,000). This rise was as a result of the planned stock
build to improve service in the key pre-Christmas months. There were also
higher infrastructure and management costs, incurred in the drive to lift
operational capability.
Mr Lever said he was convinced that the way to grow was through product
innovation to offset the reduction in demand for jewellery, a result of the
current pressure on consumers' disposable income.
He added that he wanted to further increase the company's market share and
seek new export possibilities.

Ofwat, the water industry regulator, yesterday formally referred appeals
from two water companies on tougher price limits to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
The MMC is expected to make its decision by March 28, although it could
apply for a six-month extension.
South West Water and Portsmouth Water last month requested Ofwat to refer
the price limits, which were set in July. South West, which has been hit in
recent years by the costs of meeting sewage treatment standards, is also
appealing over a reduction in connection charge limits from Pounds 1,000
each for water and sewerage services to Pounds 200.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: M Clark fortified for expansion - The
drinks group's most ambitious deal yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Matthew Clark's expansion this week of its fortified wine and cider
interests has focused attention not only on two contrasting markets, but
also on one of the industry's most acquisitive companies.
The Pounds 109m acquisition of Gaymer, which included the QC British sherry
and Olde English Cider brands, marked Clark's sixth purchase in less than
four years.
It has spent Pounds 177m and launched four rights issues to transform itself
from a small drinks distributor into the UK's largest independent
wholesaler, and a significant producer in its own right.
The change in strategy followed the arrival of Mr Peter Aikens as chief
executive from Courage in 1990. In the restructuring which followed, the
Clark family took a back seat and eventually withdrew altogether.
'My task was to change a paternalistic agency business into a
forward-looking drinks company, which generated revenues from its own
brands,' says Mr Aikens.
Investors have so far agreed. The share price has doubled in just over two
years, outperforming the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 61 per cent and the
industry sector by 70 per cent.
Following the latest issues to pay for Gaymer, the number of shares will
have increased nearly fivefold to 45.8m in less than three years. The
group's market value will have risen 10 times to about Pounds 250m in four
and a half years.
Mr Aikens says: 'We have offered investors a clear agenda of our strategy,
pure and simple. We have then delivered those expectations in full and on
time.'
This week's deal, the most ambitious so far, has still to receive the seal
of approval from City analysts. The Pounds 109m purchase price will pay off
Gaymer's debts, but in addition Clark will incur Pounds 38m of
reorganisation costs, as well as a Pounds 15m write down of assets.
On the positive side, the company says it expects property disposals to
yield about Pounds 12m, and stresses that there will be 'substantial
annualised cost savings'.
Mr Aikens says there will be rationalisation at both the production and
distribution levels. The enlarged product range, numbering some 600 lines,
would be cut by about a third, while the number of retail and wholesale
customers would also be curtailed.
'Fifteen of our customers take 80 per cent of our volume, so there's
definitely room for manoeuvre there,' said Mr Aikens.
Analysts said the provisional restructuring costs indicated some substantial
rationalisation of facilities. There was also speculation that the Warninks
business, based in the Netherlands, would be sold.
Mr Aikens refused to comment on where the cuts would fall. One analyst said:
'Those costs coming out are vital to the success of this venture.'
Analysts say the deal should be earnings neutral for the current year and
mildly enhancing in 1996. Clark said the purchase price was struck at less
than 10 times Gaymer's historic earnings, although this figure was disputed
by analysts who, taking into account the group's debts, put the figure
nearer 20.
This would be more in line with other recent deals in the industry, such as
the Allied-Lyons purchase of Domecq.
However, that deal involved some of the best-known brands in the industry,
and some analysts questioned the value put on the likes of Babycham, QC
British sherry and Olde English cider.
Following the Gaymer deal, Clark will have about 45 per cent of the UK
fortified wine market, and 12 per cent of the cider sector.
The former market, which includes Spanish sherry, British sherry-style
drinks and port, has been in decline - although the share of the
lower-priced British sherry-style brands has risen. There are some signs,
however, that the market may have bottomed out.
'Although the typical British sherry drinker tends to be older, female and
C2, younger people are being drawn into the market because of the cheaper
prices,' said Mr Robin Cooper, a drinks industry consultant.
The cider market, which has been expanding at about 6 per cent a year, is
facing margin pressure as consumption falters in the face of a welter of new
brands.
Mr Aikens said: 'Margins will come under increasing pressure and probably
come down to the same sort of levels as the rest of the branded drinks
business. We will not be starting a price war in the cider trade - but we
will fight to protect our market share.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho unsettled by Bock rumours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Lonrho, the international trading group, fell 12p to close at 131
1/2 p yesterday after rumours that Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier and
Lonrho's joint chief executive, might dispose of some or all of his 18.8 per
cent shareholding following financial difficulties at his Advanta property
group.
Mr Bock strongly denied the rumours. One of his advisers said that Mr Bock's
private holding company was in good shape.
He pointed out that it made an after-tax profit of DM88.6m (Pounds 36.3m) in
1993 and was on course for a similar result in the current year.
The rumours were apparently sparked when a leading London stockbroker
received an order to sell 500,000 Lonrho shares from an unnamed client.
There had been speculation that Deutsche Bank was concerned about loans to
Advanta, but Deutsche put out a statement saying it had no credit links with
the comp-any.
Mr Bock is battling for control of Lonrho with Mr Tiny Rowland, his fellow
joint chief executive who has dominated the group for 30 years.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eleco shares fall 7p as losses widen to
Pounds 6.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Eleco Holdings fell by 7p to 25p as the building products and
construction group revealed an increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 4.82m
to Pounds 6.31m for the year to June 30.
Mr Field Walton, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'the fundamental
decisions taken during the second half-year on restructuring the group's
activities'.
Operating losses fell to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.23m), including a reduced
deficit from ongoing activities of Pounds 756,000 (Pounds 1.21m).
A charge of Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 1.07m) represented the loss on the sale of
discontinued operations. This was mainly accounted for by a Pounds 1.93m
goodwill write-off. . Mr David Dannhauser, finance director, said the sale
of the distribution arm was for less than net asset value.
A further Pounds 424,000 of losses came from the termination of discontinued
operations and a provision of Pounds 451,000 was made against losses from
activities which are being discontinued.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 47.9m), with continuing
operations contributing Pounds 31.4m (Pounds 26m).
Mr Dannhauser said that, except for some uncertainty over unresolved excess
leasehold properties from the distribution side, the restructuring was
complete.
The structural products division, now the core activity along with cable
management, pushed pre-interest profit to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 825,000) on
turnover of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 15.8m), thanks mainly to the upturn in
housebuilding.
Cable management, a separate and non-engineered activity, carried increased
losses of Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 986,000), including Pounds 1.89m from the UK,
on flat turnover of Pounds 8.21m. The division suffered from inactivity in
commercial property construction.
Borrowings fell to Pounds 7.71m (Pounds 11.9m) at June 30, and were now
below Pounds 5m. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 724,000 (Pounds 1.11m).
Losses per share were 21.6p (15.7p loss) and again there is no dividend.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Maunders rises 62% as margins improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Modestly higher house selling prices and reduced incentives for purchasers
helped John Maunders, the Manchester-based housebuilder, report a 62 per
cent increase in full-year pre-tax profits.
The pre-tax figure for the year to June 30 jumped to Pounds 6.21m (Pounds
3.84m) on turnover ahead 11 per cent to Pounds 66.1m (Pounds 59.8m).
Operating profits increased to Pounds 6.92m (Pounds 5.3m) while interest
costs were halved at Pounds 740,000 (Pounds 1.54m).
Mr John Maunders, chairman, said: 'While, in general, selling prices did not
substantially increase, we were able to reduce various forms of purchaser
inducements, which coupled with modest price increases contributed to
healthier margins and helped offset material and labour cost increases.'
The group, which sold 949 houses, up from 904 the previous year, said
average selling prices rose from Pounds 66,000 to Pounds 69,000, due mainly
to a more expensive mix.
The landbank stood at 2,100 plots at the year-end, with a further 650 plots
under contract, and had a book value of Pounds 28.7m (Pounds 26.6m).
However, Mr Maunders noted that 'a worrying feature of the return to normal
trading has been the sharp escalation in land prices since the beginning of
the year'.
Despite press reports of sluggish house sales, Mr Maunders expected the
group's targets to be met to the end of December, and that half-year trading
results would be satisfactory.
Earnings per share increased to 16.72p (10.3p) and a 3.05p final dividend is
recommended, making a total of 5.5p (5.15p) for the year, a 6.8 per cent
increase.
At the end of June borrowings stood at Pounds 2m, representing gearing of 7
per cent.
The shares closed 2p higher at 222p.
Sir Eric Pountain, who stepped down as non-executive chairman of Tarmac in
March, has joined the Maunders board as a non-executive director.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Allied Domecq sells 641 pubs in Pounds 79m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an unusual deal, Scottish Amicable, the insurer, and the pension fund of
Strathclyde Regional Council, Scotland's biggest local authority, have
together bought 641 pubs from Allied Domecq, the UK food and drinks group,
for Pounds 74.3m.
The pubs are occupied by Pubmaster, the pub retailing arm of the heavily
indebted Brent Walker group, which will continue to lease the properties
from their new owners - but at a reduced rent.
Pubmaster is paying an additional Pounds 4.75m to Allied Domecq - until
recently Allied-Lyons - for the pubs' furniture, fittings and equipment.
Scottish Amicable has bought 75 per cent of the pubs and the rest have been
acquired by Strathclyde's pension fund, which the Glasgow-based insurer
manages.
Pubmaster, which was advised by Lazard Brothers, has been granted a 25-year
lease on the pubs at a substantial cost-saving to the Allied lease. The
agreement also allows Pubmaster to buy one fifth of the pubs every five
years - giving it the opportunity of eventually owning all the freeholds
outright.
Mr John Brackenbury, Pubmaster's chairman, said: 'The terms of the new lease
not only significantly reduce our costs but also give us greater flexibility
to manage our portfolio actively.'
Mr Alan Howie, of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said that 'this is
essentially a property transaction offering an index-linked return over 25
years. The deal provides for Pubmaster to continue to manage the portfolio
to the benefit of both parties.'
Mr Tony Trigg, chief executive of Allied Domecq Retailing, said: 'This
agreement is an important move for both parties. Pubmaster is able to secure
the long-term future of this part of the estate. We are able to realise cash
from low-growth assets for reinvestment in our core business.'
Pubmaster has leased the pubs, free of tie, from Allied Domecq since 1992.
Most of them are in the Midlands and the home counties. Pubmaster, which has
a total estate of 1,905 pubs nationally, said the pubs involved in this deal
complemented its existing strengths in the north and north-east of England.
Mr David Hunter, head of property investment at Scottish Amicable, said the
investment was underpinned by the vacant possession valuation of the
portfolio.
Pubmaster, launched in 1991, has become the UK's biggest independent pub
retailer through buying pubs from brewers such as Allied, Whitbread and
Bass, which were required to reduce the size of their estates by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: RJB may launch public offer - Pounds 1bn
cost of British Coal business will partly be met by share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining is likely to use bank debt to fund more than half the total
Pounds 1bn cost of taking over British Coal's English mining assets. That
could leave more than Pounds 400m to be raised from a share issue, which is
expected to include a public offer for sale.
RJB, which the government declared on Wednesday was its preferred bidder for
British Coal's three English regions, was financially one the strongest of
the contenders. However, following the temporary suspension of its shares
ahead of the announcement, it has a market value of less than Pounds 160m.
Even so, it persuaded NM Rothschild, the government's advisers, that it
would be able to raise the Pounds 1bn.
The nature of the British Coal business should mean that reasonably cheap
bank debt will not be too hard to find, while RJB has a strong shareholder
base to support a large equity issue.
RJB and its adviser, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, would not comment on the
details of the proposed financing but it is thought likely that over half
the funding will be provided by bank debt arranged by Barclays Mining
Finance.
'Banks are falling over themselves to lend at the moment and the cash flow
profile of the British Coal business should make it quite an attractive
proposition. RJB has already shown it can turn around former British Coal
pits quite quickly,' said one analyst.
Although it is unclear what asset value the British Coal pits would be given
in the enlarged group's books, it is likely to start life highly geared.
However, the British Coal businesses come with supply contracts with the
electricity generators lasting until March 1998. Assuming that RJB can keep
costs under control, this should guarantee at least three years of strong
cash flow, which could be used to pay down a large part of the bank debt.
RJB is thought to have offered the government about Pounds 900m for the
British Coal assets and will need to raise at least another Pounds 100m to
fund working capital and pay the transaction expenses.
Somewhat less than half the total cost is expected to be met by a share
issue. When RJB came to the market in June last year there was a poor
response from the public, with most of the shares going to institutional
investors. But it has since performed well and subsequent share placings
have given it a solid investor base.
Its leading shareholders include Mercury Asset Management, Prolific, Norwich
Union, Scottish Widows, Henderson and Abbey Life.
Institutions will have acquired the shares in the knowledge that a
successful British Coal bid would require a substantial equity issue and
Rothschild will have satisfied itself that the existing investors would
support one. It is likely to include an offer for sale, which would allow
RJB to bring in new institutional investors and give former British Coal
employees and the public the opportunity to buy shares.
Given British Coal's record, the issue will take some marketing; with the
government hoping to have everything wrapped up by Christmas, the timetable
is tight.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins holds back Alexandra
Workwear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexandra Workwear, the leading UK supplier of civilian work clothes, saw a
small increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.16m for the
half-year to August 13.
Sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 31.9m) and market share
improved, the group said. But gross margins slipped from 44 per cent at the
year-end to 43 per cent and trading profit fell to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds
2.48m).
Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said the Glasgow factories had
underperformed because of the training of 50 new staff. The opening of two
shops and refurbishment of others had added to costs, without an incremental
increase in volumes. There had also been a lower proportion of higher margin
sales, and hired work clothes had suffered because they were less attractive
to customers at times of low interest rates.
'The first quarter of the first half was much more encouraging,' Mr Budd
said. 'Trading conditions are still tough.' '
Earnings per share increased to 4.3p (4p) and the interim dividend to 2.3p
(2.1p). Borrowings have been further reduced to Pounds 4.4m and gearing was
18 per cent, against 34 per cent.
'We should eliminate borrowing by the year-end and our major capital
expenditure is over,' Mr Budd said. Two shops had been opened at York and
Cardiff, bringing the total to 37.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said orders were at encouraging levels but
uncertainty remained over proposed raw material price increases.

FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAT makes Dollars 70m investment in Russian
cigarette factory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BAT Industries is to gain almost full ownership of Moscow's Java brand
cigarette factory in return for investing more than Dollars 70m (Pounds
44.3m) over three years to modernise it. BAT will also introduce some of its
international brands to the operation.
The agreement, announced yesterday after nearly two years' negotiations, is
BAT's fifth in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Once investment
in the five ventures is complete in five years' time, they will have an
annual production capacity of more than 100bn cigarettes. BAT sold 540m
cigarettes worldwide last year.
Java is a leading brand of high quality oriental filter cigarettes in Russia
and former Soviet republics. Capacity at its Moscow plant will rise from
14bn cigarettes a year to more than 20bn when the modernisation has been
completed.
The deal has taken so long to complete since BAT signed a letter of intent
because of the complexities of the privatisation process. BAT has bought
some shares from individuals and institutions for an undisclosed sum. It
will be given additional shares in return for its investment to take its
stake to more than 90 per cent.
Java will take BAT's Russian capacity to more than 30bn cigarettes.
Souza Cruz, the Brazilian subsidiary of BAT Industries, has seen a big
increase in cigarette sales since the country launched its new
anti-inflation currency in July, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT chairman, said that sales were likely to grow from
86bn units last year to more than 100bn units next year. 'The transformation
is quite remarkable, both in terms of the lower inflation figures and the
effects on our business.'
The new currency, the real, has reduced inflation from 50 per cent a month
to less than 2 per cent, increasing the purchasing power of poorer workers.
Souza Cruz's investment plans, which include a Dollars 54m leaf plant in the
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, are on track and the company has enough
capacity to cope with increased demand.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Microsoft in Dollars 1.5bn purchase of Intuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, has agreed to
acquire Intuit, publisher of a widely-used personal financial planning
program for personal computers, for about Dollars 1.5bn in stock.
California-based Intuit is a developer of personal finance, small business
accounting and tax preparation software. Intuit's Quicken software enables
users to manage their personal and small business finances.
The companies said that the deal had been agreed by their respective boards.
Under the terms of the agreement, each Intuit share will be exchanged for
1.336 Microsoft shares, with an adjustment designed to ensure a value to
Intuit shareholders of at least Dollars 71 per Intuit share.
Microsoft said it expected to issue a total of about 27m common shares to
pay for the deal. This represents just under 5 per cent of its outstanding
shares.
'We believe that as part of Microsoft we will more quickly advance toward
our goal of improving people's financial lives and helping financial
institutions use the information highway for closer, richer relationships
with their customers,' said Mr Scott Cook, Intuit chairman.
Mr Cook will become responsible for Microsoft's business in the personal
finance sector.
'Scott and I share a vision of how technology can enable people to execute
financial transactions and make informed decisions more quickly,' added Mr
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman.
Personal finance is one of the few segments of the PC software market in
which Microsoft is not a market leader. Microsoft's Money program, which
competes with Quicken, has not been a big seller, in spite of collaborative
agreements with several large banks that link the program to their
personal-computer home banking services.
To avoid potential anti-trust problems, Microsoft has agreed to divest its
existing personal finance product, called Money. It will be sold to Novell,
although the terms have not been disclosed.
The Microsoft-Intuit agreement was announced after the close of trading
yesterday. Shares of Intuit had gained Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 50 1/4
yesterday before trading was halted. Microsoft closed at Dollars 57 1/4, up
Dollars 1.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Aerostructures plans new profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerostructures Hamble, the aircraft components company, will warn today that
its profits both this year and next will be well below its expectations when
came to the stock market in June, because of a combination of production
difficulties and order deferrals.
The resignation of Mr Andrew Barr, Aerostructures' chief executive, who
realised Pounds 1.74m from the sale of shares in the flotation, will also be
announced. Mr Barr is understood to be unwell. He will be replaced
temporarily by Mr David Ring, the commercial director, until a permanent
replacement is found.
In an attempt to placate shareholders, who are furious that no details of
these problems were contained in the flotation prospectus, a precise
timetable of when the financial difficulties came to light will be
published.
The company will say that non-executive directors, led by chairman Lord
King, former British Airways chairman, had no knowledge of the problems
until a board meeting in mid-September. The non-executives then informed NM
Rothschild, the merchant bank which brought Aerostructures to the market.
Rothschild passed the bad news to Aerostructures's auditors, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, its stockbrokers, Smith New Court, and Ashurst Morris Crisp,
solicitors to the flotation. Shareholders were not told until September 21.
Today's statement will say Aerostructures's executives first became aware of
production difficulties in the middle of July, but the financial
implications were not apparent to them. By the middle of August, they began
to realise the difficulties could have an adverse effect on results.
The delay of several weeks in informing the full board was a combination of
'bad luck and bad judgment', according to a company employee with a close
knowledge of the report.
However, Hamble's shareholders, led by Abbey Life and Henderson
Administration, are likely to become even more angry when they learn that
the company's prospects in 1995 have deteriorated, because substantial
orders have been deferred.
Although Aerostructures is expected to make a profit in 1994, the outlook
for 1995 is understood to be less certain.
The prospectus said 'market conditions' in 1994 were 'broadly similar to
1993'. It said action had been taken to make 'operational cost savings' so
that profit margins would be better than in 1993. It said: 'Accordingly, the
directors are confident about the prospects for the year'. There was also an
optimistic statement about future growth. As a result, Rothschild is
expecting to face a barrage of criticism from shareholders in coming weeks.
Aerostructures was floated at 120p, valuing the company at Pounds 57m. Its
share price, which fell sharply on September 21, closed yesterday at 59p.
The quality of components supplied by Aerostructures had been a concern to
British Aerospace, its biggest customer, since the late spring, according to
defence executives with a close knowledge of both companies. BAe seconded
several engineers to Aerostructures in May to try to rectify problems before
they had an impact on BAe equipment.
The difficulties proved worse than BAe initially expected. BAe now has 48
engineers at Hamble working on quality control problems affecting rear
fuselages of Hawk and Harrier fighter aircraft, which Aerostructures makes
for BAe. BAe has the capacity to take the manufacturing back to its own
plant, but has decided not to do so.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Partners sought to take Bull by horns: The French computer
group faces a tough task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries was appointed chairman of Groupe Bull last
October, he was presented with a life or death battle. The French computer
manufacturer which had racked up losses of more than FFr15bn (Pounds 1.8bn)
over the past three years, a feat rivalled only by Air France and Credit
Lyonnais - the two other black holes of the French public sector.
Since his arrival, he has launched a restructuring plan aimed at stemming
losses, redressing Bull's battered reputation and finding a path to the
private sector.
A vital condition for his mission has been what he describes as a 'one-time,
last-time' capital injection to eliminate the group's debt burden. Thus,
Wednesday's decision by the European Commission to approve capital increases
totalling FFr11.1bn represents a significant step in Mr Descarpentries'
recovery plan.
It is testimony to the task confronting Bull, however, that the capital
increase is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of survival. Despite
the award of the capital increase, Bull still faces a tough task in proving
it can get back on course, and that it can entice industry partners
necessary for long-term security.
There is much at stake. Bull is one of Europe's few remaining computer
manufacturers and a symbol of France's determination to maintain a presence
in the increasingly competitive sector.
For Mr Descarpentries, failure is now firmly off the agenda. He predicts
that after a net loss of FFr5.07bn in 1993, the group will break even at the
operating level by the end of this year, and at the net level in 1995.
Such ambitious objectives are based on the chairman's battle plan. He has
implemented a series of cost-cutting measures, reducing Bull's Paris sites
from 25 to five, disposing of non-core assets, and accelerating a plan to
cut 6,500 jobs in 1993 and 1994.
Equally important, however, has been the reorganisation of the management
structure. Mr Descarpentries has broken Bull into profit centres, with seven
product/service divisions and four geographic networks. The new
organisation, aimed at tightening notoriously lax reporting procedures, is
controlled by a 10-member management board, selected by the new chairman.
In so doing, Mr Descarpentries has sought to remedy the structural
weaknesses of the group which, along with the fierce price competition in
the computer industry, prompted Bull's decline. As Mr Gerard Longuet, the
French industry minister, said at the time of Mr Descarpentries'
appointment: 'Since its nationalisation in 1982, Bull has been too dependent
on the state and too inflexible. This has undermined its ability to respond
to the upheavals in its markets.'
Mr Longuet now takes a more optimistic line. 'Bull is on the road to
recovery,' he claims. His view is endorsed by the European Commission, which
says Mr Descarpentries' achievements help justify the approval of the
capital increase.
These encouraging sentiments are buttressed by signs of improvement at the
bottom line. Losses in the first half of this year were more than halved to
FFr843m, compared with FFr1.98bn in the comparable period in 1993. Zenith
Data Systems, the personal computer division which has been one of Bull's
principal sources of losses since its acquisition in 1989, is also on the
mend.
But despite Bull's progress, important questions remain about the group's
strategy and its ability to forge the alliances necessary to secure its
position in the international industry. As one computer industry analyst
puts it: 'Cost-cutting takes you only so far. Bull does not have the
international scale to feel secure in the industry. That is important
because the shake-out in the industry is far from over.'
This sentiment was echoed by an independent audit ordered by the Commission.
The report argued that that privatisation and the formation of industrial
alliances is essential for Bull's future. 'This operation must start as soon
as possible . . . an agreement with new shareholders must be found, if not
finalised, between now and June 1995,' claims the report. It argues that the
status quo is not an option.
The message is not lost on Mr Descarpentries, who has concluded a series of
strategic alliances to strengthen Bull's operations. Since the beginning of
last month, the French group announced separate alliances with Tandem,
Motorola and Wang of the US.
The problem, however, is that Bull is in pressing need of partners to
replace the French state on the shareholder register. Officials at the
industry ministry and at the company say that negotiations are proceeding
well with potential investors, while the government expects to launch a
tender offer within the next few weeks. The aim is to reduce the
government's 76 per cent holding to a minority before next spring's
presidential elections.
Bull's improving results render the company a more attractive proposition,
but investors will take some persuading. IBM, which holds 2.1 per cent of
Bull's shares, appears unwilling to be wooed. The US group has said it will
continue to co-operate with Bull in areas such as reduced instruction set
computing (Risc) microprocessor technology.
But it declined to participate in last year's capital increase. More
probable is that NEC of Japan, which holds 4.4 per cent of Bull, and which
co-develops mainframe computers with the French company, will raise its
holding.
Not surprisingly, the Bull chairman and his state shareholders argue that it
is speed rather than nationality which is the priority. This represents a
contrast from the situation in 1991, when Mrs Edith Cresson, then Socialist
premier, opposed NEC's investment in Bull. The change in stance partly
reflects a more liberal attitude by the centre-right government. But the
principal difference is the urgency of Bull's need.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Body Shop profits up despite ethics row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop International, the cosmetics retailer, said yesterday recent
criticism of its 'green' credentials had had little impact on sales, as it
reported a 23 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 10m
to Pounds 12.3m .
Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said there was a 'very small, almost
unnoticeable drop in (UK) customer numbers at one point, but the recovery
was almost immediate'. In the US, sales had not been affected.
The controversy was sparked by a US magazine article which questioned Body
Shop's treatment of franchisees, its ethical trading and animal testing
policies, and product ingredients.
Body Shop rejects the criticisms, but said it was not planning to take legal
action.
Mr Roddick added that the company stood by its animal testing policies, but
was bringing in an unnamed 'European organisation' to carry out an
independent assessment of its policies.
It is also bringing in consultants to carry out a 'social audit', examining
such issues as human resources, relations with franchisees, and third world
trade activities.
Mr Roddick said he hoped criticism of the company, which last year won a
libel case against the makers of a Channel 4 television, documentary, would
now die.
Mr Stuart Rose, managing director, said Body Shop's results for the half
year to August 31 - which were towards the top of market expectations -
reflected the 'stability' provided by having operations in 45 countries.
Total sales increased 18 per cent to Pounds 208.1m, while sales through Body
Shop's company-owned shops increased 13 per cent to Pounds 93.5m. Second
half trading was following a similar trend.
Total UK sales increased 7 per cent to Pounds 60.7m, with US sales up 31 per
cent at Pounds 38.1m. Turnover elsewhere increased 21 per cent to Pounds
109.3m.
Like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, increased 5 per cent
in the UK, but fell 1 per cent in the US. Like-for-like sales elsewhere
increased 14 per cent.
Body Shop plans to increase customer awareness in the US through
'documercials', or paid-for information films during off-peak periods on
cable television. It has hired its first advertising agency, Chiat/Day,
which is investigate new forms of media advertising for the company,
including using the Internet.
Some 83 new shops were opened in the period, taking the total to 1,136, with
80 more planned for the second half. The interim dividend was increased from
0.75p to 0.9p, with earnings up from 3.4p to 4.2p per share.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Rouble climbs 20% after sharp decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian rouble, which lost more than a fifth of its value this week on
'Black Tuesday', staged a startling recovery yesterday, climbing 20 per cent
against the dollar. Its rise prompted currency traders to break out into
spontaneous applause on the floor of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange
(Micex).
There was heavy buying of the rouble by commercial banks at yesterday's
auction but it was not clear to what extent the Central Bank had intervened.
The bank denied reports it spent Dollars 155m (Pounds 98m) buying the rouble
but declined further comment.
The government moved quickly to fill the post of finance minister following
the sacking of Mr Sergei Dubinin on Wednesday. Mr Andrei Vavilov, the deputy
finance minister who has strong reformist leanings, was named acting finance
minister. His appointment has yet to be confirmed by parliament.
The rouble's wild fluctuations have left currency traders, politicians and
the public bewildered. 'Trade on the Micex continues to amaze,' was the
headline yesterday of the normally sober RIA government newsagency. One
western economist in Moscow said: 'It is understandable that there has been
steady pressure on the rouble given the seasonal increase in credits and the
rise in inflation. But I am not sure that anybody knows what caused
Tuesday's stampede. The political reverberations are likely to prove more
significant than the brief economic shock.'
Appearing before the parliament's budget committee, Mr Victor Gerashchenko,
head of the Central Bank, said he could not understand the reasons behind
the rouble crash on Tuesday.
The Central Bank said its foreign exchange reserves had fallen to Dollars
1.8bn from Dollars 2.45bn on October 1, seemingly leaving it vulnerable to
renewed speculation. But it has already introduced some changes to the
payment system to encourage greater stability.
The new finance minister, Mr Vavilov, received strong endorsements from
western diplomats and economists.
He will have an important role in Russia's negotiations with an
International Monetary Fund mission which arrives in Moscow at the weekend.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Japan's big banks enter securities markets
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese Ministry of Finance has given the go-ahead for five leading
Japanese commercial banks to move into the securities markets.
Their arrival next month will represent one of the most substantial
shake-ups in the history of Japan's financial system.
The ministry announced yesterday that it had accepted the final details of
the banks' plans to establish securities subsidiaries, as part of the
continuing liberalisation of Japan's rigidly regulated financial system.
The five banks - Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sakura and Mitsubishi - will
establish units next month each backed by capital of about Y40bn (Pounds
253m) and employing up to 120 staff.
The world's largest bank, Sumitomo, failed to win approval because of a
disagreement with regulators over the name of its planned subsidiary.
Japan previously strictly segregated banks and securities companies along
the lines of the US Glass-Steagall Act. The ministry, mindful of the threat
that the new brokerages represent to existing brokers, has, for the time
being at least, limited the scope of their activities.
They are not permitted to compete in the main area of securities business -
equity trading - and there must be strict 'fire walls' between the parent
companies and their offshoots. The banks' units will be restricted to
corporate bond issuance.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Howard raises prospect of compulsory ID cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, yesterday raised the prospect that
British citizens might be forced to carry identity cards for the first time
since the wartime requirement was abolished in 1952.
Seeking to mollify Conservative representatives demanding tougher action
against crime, Mr Howard told the party conference in Bournemouth that
proposals for ID cards would be set out in a green paper in the spring.
He promised 'full consultation' on a range of options, including compulsory
cards and a voluntary system limited to drivers and social security
claimants, which would cover three-quarters of the population.
In his conference speech, Mr Howard focused on a voluntary card. But asked
later whether compulsory cards would be considered, he said nothing was
ruled out.
He said ID cards could also be used as a bank card, driving licence, social
security card and kidney donor card. 'In time carrying your ID card would
seem as natural as carrying a credit card is at the moment,' he said.
However, Mr Howard's efforts to explain how a voluntary system might work
were interrupted by booing and heckling from rank and file Tories,
demonstrating the pressures on the government to move quickly to compulsory
cards.
Mr Howard, whose standing within the cabinet has been undermined by rising
public concern over crime, won a two minute standing ovation after telling
the conference: 'I hear your message loud and clear.'
Replying to widespread calls for more police and longer prison sentences, he
said the fight against crime would be boosted by tougher powers for the
courts to confiscate criminals' assets and fine the parents of juvenile
offenders.
But friends said his cautious proposals for ID cards reflected concerns that
the issue could prompt a serious split in the cabinet, which is divided on
practical and philosophic grounds.
Mr John Major strongly supports the use of ID cards, which he believes would
help cut crime. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, is also believed to
favour a comprehensive system.
But there is opposition from ministers on both wings of the party. Mr Peter
Lilley, social security secretary, is opposed on libertarian grounds. Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, thinks that compulsory cards are out of
tune with the party's commitment to individual freedom but is moving towards
accepting a voluntary system.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Palestinian police arrest 200 in search for soldier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip yesterday arrested more than 200
members of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement in an attempt to find a
kidnapped Israeli soldier ahead of the deadline set by his captors.
Hamas has said it will kill 19-year-old Corporal Nachshon Waxman at 9
o'clock this evening unless Israel releases about 200 Palestinian prisoners.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, reiterated yesterday that the
whole peace process could suffer unless Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine
Liberation Organisation leader, is able to bring about Mr Waxman's release.
Mr Rabin has already suspended talks in Cairo between Israeli and PLO
delegations on the next phases of the autonomy programme, and has placed the
Gaza Strip under a closure order that is keeping 30,000 Gazans away from
their jobs in Israel.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, has said he considers the
kidnapping a test of Mr Arafat's authority in the autonomous Palestinian
areas.
Mr Arafat yesterday ordered almost 9,000 Palestinian policemen in the Gaza
Strip to mount searches for Mr Waxman. But although the PLO said that
contacts with Hamas indicated that Mr Waxman was still alive, there were no
leads as to where he might be being held.
Indicating that he held Iran to be at least indirectly responsible for the
kidnapping, through its encouragement of Islamic extremism in the occupied
territories, Mr Arafat vowed that he would 'not allow any defiance' of the
rule in Gaza of his Palestinian National Authority. Hamas meanwhile accused
Mr Arafat of doing Israel's 'dirty work'.
Mr Yehuda Waxman, the missing soldier's father, offered last night to pay
for his son's freedom.
But a leaflet released by the Hamas military wing, which has claimed
responsibility for the kidnapping, offered no hope of compromise. If Israel
did not meet the demand for the release of Palestinian prisoners, headed by
the Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmad Yasin, 'then the soldier will be executed a
short while after the deadline'.
It claimed that Mr Waxman 'is in an area you (Israel) are occupying, and not
in a silly autonomous zone'.
Mr Christopher flew to Damascus from Jerusalem last night for his second
meeting this week with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Mr Rabin said Mr
Christopher had briefed him on some minor softening of Syrian positions on a
peace deal, but that the large gaps blocking an accord had still not been
bridged. Mr Rabin, who flew to Amman late on Wednesday to meet King Hussein,
said he hoped a full peace accord with Jordan could be signed by the end of
the year.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was little to complain about in yesterday's figures from Body Shop.
The adverse publicity which has swirled around the group this summer has had
no perceptible impact on sales. The decline in like-for-like turnover in the
UK, a feature of the results in 1992-93, has been arrested. The expansion of
the retail network continues apace, especially in Asia where sales were up
46 per cent in total and 91 per cent ahead in Japan alone. Despite all the
worries that surround one of the last 80s go-go stocks still to be going,
the Body Shop formula seems to be in good order. The number of shops
operated around the world should rise from 1,136 now to at least 2,000 by
the end of the century.
Two doubts remain. The first is the US, where Body Shop, on its own
admission, has a weak market position reflected in a 1 per cent drop in
like-for-like sales in the first half. Body Shop is hoping to tackle this
with intensified marketing and advertising. The second problem is mounting
competition in the UK. Today the first Bath &amp; Body Works opens, a joint
venture between The Limited, a powerful US retail group, and Next. Over five
years this may pose a serious threat. In the short term, though, Body Shop's
earnings momentum will not be endangered and the shares' premium rating
seems justified.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The near 3 per cent drop in Cadbury Schweppes' share price against
yesterday's buoyant market trend must be galling for the company which last
month announced the best interim results in the food manufacturing sector.
It is especially so when Tesco's agreement to market Virgin Cola - the
immediate trigger to the share price fall - poses a minimal direct threat to
Cadbury's profits. Only 4 to 5 per cent of total group earnings derives from
soft drinks sold in UK supermarkets. Of that a fraction is Coca-Cola sold in
Tesco.
But the link between Tesco and Virgin, which will lend its name to a drink
brewed by the Canadian Cott Corporation, is symptomatic of change in the
balance of power between retailers and food manufacturers. Supermarkets'
private label products have gained ground at the expense of traditional
brands, skewering manufacturers' margins. Until recently one segment of the
market which has resisted the threat has been soft drinks, where the own
label share of the market rose modestly from 28 to 33 per cent between 1980
and 1993. However J. Sainsbury's launch of its Classic Cola earlier this
year turned the tables against the manufacturers. Tesco's link with Virgin
Cola is a further assault on the plump margins earned by Coca-Cola &amp;
Schweppes Beverages.
To a large extent, the share price reaction reflects sentiment rather than
fundamentals. But that sentiment is understandable - the Cola wars may
spread spread beyond the supermarkets. The Tesco/Virgin deal is the thin end
of an unpleasant wedge for Cadbury.

Japanese financial liberalisation is as slow as it is inevitable, as
yesterday's announcement that five commercial banks can start securities
operations next month shows. The ministry of finance is determined to
proceed at its own glacial pace. This is no big bang. Sumitomo has been
excluded for reasons of semantics, and the successful candidates will only
be allowed to participate in corporate bonds, not equities. The slow march
to liberalisation is partly explained by a bureaucracy's unwillingness to
yield power. Liberalisation, conceived in the heady days of late 1980s, is
also difficult to implement in the depths of recession. The ministry also
wants to avoid a rush of casualties among the securities houses.
Yesterday's development is still significant. The big four brokers, Nomura,
Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi, will scarcely be troubled. Similarly the
long-term credit banks, such as the Industrial Bank of Japan, have had time
to establish successful bond operations. However, prospects for second tier
brokers are bleak. The five commercial banks need to compensate for the
decline in their traditional corporate lending operations by aggressively
pursuing bond business.
Smaller brokers will struggle to compete. Some may need rescuing. This would
be a natural price for the ministry to exact, if it is eventually to let
commercial banks into the equity market too. Daiwa's rescue of Cosmo
Securities provides the model. When that happens the big four may face real
competition.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Price for optimism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets round the world took a remarkably sanguine view of
yesterday's US producer price figures. The September headline fall of 0.5
per cent certainly looks good, but as a guide to sentiment the figures have
a shelf life of just one day. Today the markets must digest data on consumer
prices, capacity utilisation and retail sales. Besides, the producer price
figures were distorted by sharp falls in the prices of both petrol and cars,
the latter probably reflecting efforts by manufacturers to shed stocks of
1994 models. The underlying trend for intermediate goods and raw materials
suggests some inflationary pressure in the pipeline. With capacity use
around 85 per cent, companies may be tempted to pass higher prices on.
There is thus no compelling reason to revise expectations that the Federal
Reserve will decide to tighten at least once more. If so, yesterday's rally
could prove short-lived. But much depends on the extent of the Fed's
eventual action and how convinced markets are that the tightening process
has come to an end. Given its performance over the last week - the long bond
yield has fallen back by about 20 basis points - the bond market appears in
the mood to look for a turning point.
Yields of around 8 per cent look good value to long-term investors, even if
there is a risk of short-term setbacks. Bonds would become exceptionally
attractive once inflation has been definitively capped, so at some point
bond prices will rally rather than fall on news of a rise in short rates.
The outlook for equities is different: valuations are stretched with the
yield ratio to bonds at around 2.8 times. That looks uncomfortable when
policy aims to slow the economy down.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Further cracks in emperor's image: Robert Graham discusses
whether the Berlusconi government in Italy is likely to survive the latest
blows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five months into office, and the Berlusconi government has already acquired
the air of a lame-duck administration. Through inexperience and poor
judgment, Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned premier, has scored a
string of own goals, which have brought his own future and the durability of
his government into question.
He has become involved in a bruising battle with the judiciary over
corruption investigations into his Fininvest business empire, in which
something has to give - with the threat of his implication the stuff of
every newspaper's front page for the past two weeks.
He has failed to find a quick solution to the conflict of interest between
his role as head of government and his ownership of Italy's second largest
private business group. And his nerve in introducing much-needed reforms is
due to be tested today by a four-hour general strike in protest at cuts in
pension and healthcare benefits in the 1995 budget.
The unions organised similar general strikes against the two previous
budgets, of the Amato and Ciampi governments, and Mr Berlusconi has
dismissed today's protest as 'a ritual performance to reassert their
presence and identity'.
But this time there is a genuine sense of confrontation, with the pensions
issue affecting a large cross-section of the electorate.
The government has failed to communicate the genuine urgency of tackling the
pensions issue and confused people by frequent changes in the detail of the
proposal. Many are worried they will lose out, or simply do not know their
status. This is evident both in street conversations as well as in the
responses to hotlines run by the newspapers and government.
Those who know Mr Berlusconi well say he has failed in his usually
successful role as a communicator, because he has a visceral distaste of
communicating bad news. He has only begun to talk of the need for
'sacrifices' in the past two weeks, and this in low key.
'We get the feeling Berlusconi changed tactics at the last minute and sought
a confrontation with us which he always said he wanted to avoid,' comments
one senior trade unionist.
Certainly the government was bending over backwards to accommodate the
unions until Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat and an arbiter of
business opinion, called in Mr Berlusconi for an informal dinner, dubbed
'the last supper', on September 23. Mr Berlusconi is believed to have been
told that without a tough budget his government stood no chance of winning
international credibility, let alone of retaining the continuing support of
the business community that he claims to represent. From this point on, the
government's position toughened and the 1995 budget presented a courageous
attempt to reform the money-devouring pay-as-you-go state pensions system.
Italy will now accelerate the pace at which it moves to fix the male
retirement age at 65 and the female at 60; early retirement will be
penalised; the rate at which pensions accrue will be cut and private schemes
will be encouraged.
No one disputes the need for these changes. The markets, in particular, are
worried about Italy's budget deficit and mountain of debt. Treasury funding
of the pensions deficit will be almost L85,000bn (Pounds 34bn) this year
and, if unchecked, will play havoc with Italy's future financial stability.
Indeed, having courted unpopularity in the budget, it is arguable that Mr
Berlusconi should have been more ambitious in his aims. In 1993, the Amato
government found almost double the L50,000bn being sought by Mr Berlusconi
in new revenues and spending cuts.
Even if the general strike passes off quietly, the government will only have
won a breathing space for Italy's public finances. Similar, perhaps larger
sums will have to be found to keep the budget deficit from rising above 8
per cent of gross domestic product again in 1996.
But as a leader, Mr Berlusconi has failed to impose his authority on the
cabinet. He swings between listening to the hawkish advice of those such as
Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the minister for parliamentary affairs, and Mr Cesare
Previti, his Fininvest lawyer and now defence minister, and listening to the
more cautious counsel of his other colleagues. The hawks have pushed him
into frequent clashes with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, which he has
invariably lost.
Mr Berlusconi is also proving thin-skinned. He reacts defensively even to
constructive criticism and sees conspiracies against him everywhere, not
least in the local and foreign press. He complains openly about how hard he
has to work, as if the country were ungrateful for his personal sacrifice.
'The quality of my life has deteriorated since I took on this job,' he said
this week, adding: 'I work 16 to 18 hours a day.'
While these faults could be put down to inexperience, others are seemingly
irremediable. These derive from Mr Berlusconi having entered politics
without clearing his position with the judiciary over corruption
investigations into Fininvest and without distancing himself properly from
his ownership of Fininvest.
As a result, he has been weakened by continual conflicts of interest. The
worst involves the government shake-up of the RAI, the state broadcasting
organisation, which risks being beneficial to his own three commercial
channels. Only at the last minute, on President Scalfaro's insistence, was
legislation removed from the 1995 budget that raised the RAI's annual
operating fee and left that of Fininvest untouched.
This week the senate began to debate proposals drawn up by three
Berlusconi-appointed jurists on ways to avoid a conflict of interest. Mr
Berlusconi has promised that legislation based on the jurists' ideas will be
considered by the next cabinet. However, Fininvest is deeply rooted in the
government, having provided three ministers plus the funds and organisation
for Forza Italia, Mr Berlusconi's support movement. In addition, any
solution to the conflict of interest is likely to be slow and partial
because Fininvest is so big and so indebted.
Mr Berlusconi also now finds himself in open conflict with Milan magistrates
and their colleagues in Rome and Turin, who are pursuing separate inquiries
into Fininvest affairs. The most damaging investigation is into allegations
of bribing the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to turn a blind eye
to the true ownership of Telepiu, the cable TV channel in which Fininvest
has a declared 10 per cent stake.
Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor, in a serious
breach of his judicial role publicly warned last week that the net of
investigation was closing round Mr Berlusconi. The magistrates cannot go on
playing a cat and mouse game with the prime minister. Equally, given the
continued popularity of the magistrates, it will be hard for the government
to head them off.
For Mr Berlusconi's main coalition partners - the populist Northern League
of Mr Umberto Bossi, and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, headed by Mr
Gianfranco Fini - this has proved reason enough to begin manoeuvring
themselves for Mr Berlusconi's departure as prime minister. If he were to
go, they calculate that Forza Italia would collapse as it has no rationale
other than to back the prime minister.
Mr Fini is making himself more attractive by pushing the uglier elements in
his movement to one side. Simultaneously he is wooing, with considerable
success, Forza Italia support in southern Italy. However, he is unlikely to
do anything to prejudice the existence of the government as long as Mr
Berlusconi stays. Mr Bossi, on the other hand, has always been uncomfortable
in the coalition and will pull out whenever it suits him. He is already
emphasising the League's separate identity, and testing new alliances in the
centre and on the left.
The opposition has not really shown its hand. The main group, the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is still adjusting to the new
leadership of Mr Massimo D'Alema after the angry resignation of Mr Achille
Occhetto in the wake of its defeat in the March general elections.
But, tactically, the PDS wants to see the Berlusconi government thoroughly
discredited so as to avoid the reshaping or enlargement of the rightwing
coalition. The party is against early elections, preferring to wait for a
further refinement of the 1993 electoral laws that introduced the
first-past-the-post system - a view shared by all the political parties. The
need to change the electoral law also limits Mr Berlusconi's ability to go
to the country with a snap election.
The situation is thus profoundly unstable and uncertain. If Mr Berlusconi
now faces a limited tenure, he has no one but himself to blame. He has
squandered a huge groundswell of popular support, alienated sympathetic
investors and, if he is not careful, could damage Italy's economic recovery,
which looks stronger every day.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Leading Article: The choices for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of Sunday's German general election will have an impact well
beyond Germany's borders. Europe's pivotal nation has the chance of using
the next four years both to put its economic house in order and to prepare
the European Union for a decisive phase of enlargement at the beginning of
the next century.
The next German government should set itself three prime objectives: to
improve the country's economic structure; to narrow the gap between east and
west Germans; and to make Germany a more effective proponent of European
integration.
Pressing attention needs to be given to public finances. In spite of this
year's faster than expected recovery, public spending and revenue as a
proportion of gross domestic product will be 5 per cent higher next year
than before unification. By the end of this year public debt will have
doubled since 1990. The next government will have to make further cuts in
spending, including on welfare benefits. It will also have to maintain
efforts to encourage labour flexibility and to reduce state interference in
the economy.
Net public sector transfers to east Germany should fall gradually from now
on. But east Germany will hardly come close to matching overall economic
performance in the west for another 15 years. The next government needs
somehow to infuse east and west Germans with a sense of their joint
responsibility in over-coming the legacy of 40 years' division.
Kohl's belief
Though often vague and indecisive about details, the incumbent chancellor,
Helmut Kohl, deserves credit for sticking to one fundamental belief: that
the unification of Germany must be carried out within the wider context of
Europe. The difficulties involved in the process have caused some ebbing of
German support for his vision, but Mr Kohl himself is unlikely to abandon
it.
If still in power after October 16 he may have to be more cautious about
urging an extension of supranational European decision-making, in deference
both to German public opinion and to his European partners. But neither he
nor any successor is likely to abandon the priority of opening the Union to
central and eastern Europe, so that the inevitable expansion of German
influence there can occur as part of a wider integration process.
So Germany will have to be more strenuous than ever in advocating reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy, the structural funds, and the Union's
decision-making machinery. It will also have to be prepared to play a full
part in common European defence arrangements, which means overcoming the
remaining inhibitions about deploying German soldiers as part of
multinational forces outside the Nato area.
Gargantuan tasks
All these policies are likely to be espoused most readily if Mr Kohl remains
in power, and continues his alliance with the liberal Free Democrats. That
is the outcome which most of Germany's foreign partners will be hoping for.
The only doubt is whether Mr Kohl and his colleagues, after so many years in
office, still have the stamina required for such gargantuan tasks.
A coalition of Social Democrats and Greens is less likely - and would be
less well-equipped to tackle Germany's pressing economic problems. A more
likely outcome is that the FDP will fall short of the 5 per cent threshold
required for representation in the Bundestag, with the result that Mr Kohl
has to form a 'grand coalition' with the SPD.
Such a coalition might have greater difficulty in agreeing on policies than
the present one, but it could be better placed to implement them once it had
done so, especially as it would not have to fear a veto on its tax
legislation from the SPD majority in the Bundesrat (federal council). It
would also have great pedagogic value for the SPD, which, like other social
democratic parties, finds it easier to adjust to unwelcome realities in
office than in opposition. In the 1960s such a grand coalition provided a
three-year transitional phase before the SPD took over the leadership of the
country in 1969. The return of the present coalition led by a re-energised
Mr Kohl would be the best outcome: but a grand coalition would not signal a
fundamental change of course.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Cause for mild celebration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weakness of the Berlusconi government is in stark contrast to the
strength of the Italian economy, which is now recovering faster from
recession than any other in Europe.
Gross domestic product has registered growth in three consecutive quarters.
The latest figures, covering April-June, show that the economy grew by 2.3
per cent over the quarter compared with the same period in 1993. All the
indicators point to strengthening of demand - from a pick-up in investment,
to increased imports and a rise in domestic consumption.
The revived fortunes of Fiat, the Turin-based automotive group, is typical
of the turnround in industry: Fiat claims the worst is over, with sharp
increases in sales and a return to profit. Small and medium-sized businesses
say they are flush with export orders from machine tools to shoes.
The only area where the recession is still biting is in the south. But this
reflects the problems of the state-controlled companies that are so
important to the southern economy and the reduced flow of public funds to
the mezzogiorno.
Though the picture is still patchy nationwide, employment levels overall are
beginning to stabilise. However, unemployment remains high in the south,
often double the 6-7 per cent levels in the north.
The Berlusconi government has been in office for too short a time to claim
much credit for what has occurred. The recovery has been export-led since
the middle of last year, and dates back to the boost given to foreign sales
by the devaluation of the lira in September 1992.
Nevertheless the government has been anxious to stimulate the recovery. Mr
Berlusconi insists that the overall tax level should not be raised above the
1993-94 level. He instinctively feels that higher growth is the best way to
boost treasury receipts, rather than higher taxes.
Accordingly, he has provided tax breaks to encourage new investment and
jobs. The government has also helped the construction sector by unfreezing
the 18-month-old block on public works, imposed as a result of the
corruption scandals uncovered in the placing of contracts for such work.
The rapid return to growth provides further evidence of the traditional
resilience of the economy, especially its productive base. It also confirms
the old adage that the economy grows in spite of 53 postwar governments -
not because of them.
However, economic growth is still shaped by high interest rates, which are 4
percentage points higher than German rates. So long as Italy retains a large
stock of public sector debt - currently more than 125 per cent of GDP -
interest rates cannot easily be brought in line with the main EU partners.
The perceived weakness of the government has seen consistent speculation
against the lira since July. In mid-August, the Bank of Italy raised the
discount rate by half a percentage point. One consequence of this increase
is that the cost of servicing the government's debt will exceed the
projection in the 1995 budget. Further political instability is bound to
mitigate against a lowering of rates.
A second reason for the summer's interest rate rise was to curb inflationary
pressures. Since July, inflation has edged up beyond the budget projections
to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent. With the economic recovery stronger than
expected, this could put further pressure on prices. Few believe Italy can
achieve the 2.5 per cent inflation target set by the government for the end
of 1995.
A central element in reducing the rate of inflation has been wage
moderation, with wages having declined in real terms since 1992. A new
spirit of pragmatism was enshrined in the July 1993 agreement between the
government, unions and employers under which the unions agreed to link wage
rises to productivity. They also dropped wage indexation - automatic
increases in line with inflation - in return for government commitments on
better job training and investment in R&amp;D.
However, the confrontation between the government and the unions over the
1995 budget is likely to put considerable strain on this accord.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Observer: Fringe benefits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Much to the alarm of Tory officials at the conference in Bournemouth, they
were asked to sanction a fringe meeting entitled 'Let's kill all the
lawyers'.
The sponsor - the Law Society - explained that the offensive words were a
quotation from Shakespeare's Henry VI, part two; so that's all right.
Other useful Shakespeare quotes: 'Bump off all the accountants' (Measure for
Measure); 'See off all the ad men' (Love's Labour's Lost); 'Let's see how
much these quangos really cost' (The Winter's Tale); and 'Portillo's for the
chop' (King John).

FT  14 OCT 94 / Observer: Body Shop shapes up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Body Shop has not finished collecting famous names for its letterhead.
Indeed it is seeking an 'industrial entrepreneur with wide international
experience'.
Sounds just the job for condoms-to-airlines magnate Richard Branson. He
shares Anita and Gordon Roddick's unconventional business attitudes. And as
the Virgin PR machine reminds us, Virgin and Body Shop are perhaps the UK's
only new, internationally recognised brands in the past 20 years.
Just one snag: one of Body Shop's new non-executives - appointed yesterday -
is Penny Hughes, the UK's Coca-Cola president, and soon facing a brand war
with Branson's newest product, Virgin Cola.
Surely there's a half-forgotten tribe somewhere, whose medicine man has time
on his hands?

FT  14 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Opt-in to identity cards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a rich irony that the most Euro-phobic Conservative party conference
since the war has spawned a proposal for a national UK identity card. What
ought to go without saying may therefore need to be said: that a thorough
assessment of continental experience with ID cards needs to be made before
proceeding further. This must pay particular attention to the civil
liberties implications that weigh heavily in the debate.
In his conference speech yesterday Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said
that the government consultation paper to be published next spring would
offer a range of options, including the status quo. But the specific idea he
floated is bound to be taken as a starting point for the debate. He proposed
a 'voluntary' card which would be used as a driving licence and as a state
benefits card. 'No one else would be forced to get one,' he said, but added:
'In time carrying your ID card would seem as natural as carrying a credit
card is at the moment.'
It is immediately obvious that such a card would be far from voluntary for
most people. About three-quarters of the population are drivers and/or state
benefits recipients. If the card were truly voluntary, drivers and benefits
claimants would be able to choose between an ID card or the status quo. In
fact, Mr Howard clearly envisaged that such an ID card would rapidly become
near-universal, since he went on to claim that it could also help tackle
under-age drinking and smoking.
Police powers
If an ID card is to be introduced, it should be truly optional for at least
a lengthy trial period. It should also be laid down in statute that the card
gives the police and other enforcement officers no greater powers than they
currently possess. So for traffic purposes the police would have no right to
see the card on demand, and they would have no wider right to see it at all.
Unless ID cards are introduced on that basis, there is little prospect of
them enjoying the broad public support that is essential in a society which
prizes the liberty of individuals from harassment by the police and public
officials. Recall Lord Chief Justice Goddard, who sank Britain's wartime
identity cards in the early 1950s by ruling that the obligation to produce
them 'tends to make people resentful of the acts of the police and inclines
them to obstruct the police instead of to assist them'.
However, with these important caveats, there is much to be said for a
voluntary ID card. If it takes the form of the most advanced type of smart
card, it could serve not merely as a form of identification, but as a
banking card and as a store of personal data of all kinds including donor
wishes and insurance and medical records.
Expected welcome
Many people would welcome such a card. After all, most people happily go
about their daily life with a purse or wallet full of cards: there are
already some 300m smart cards in circulation; the number is expected to
increase to some 3bn within the decade.
Most people also appear to be happy with the increasingly widespread use of
insurance numbers for non-insurance purposes. NI numbers were originally
used for keeping track of insurance contributions and benefits. Now they are
also used for income tax and, more recently, for personal equity plans and
tax-exempt savings accounts. Even children have numbers, in the form of
'child reference numbers' issued for child benefit - all of which involves
more cards or payments books.
The crucial point is that only those authorised in advance by the card
holder should be able to gain access to particular categories of records
held on a multipurpose ID card. In theory, this could be done fairly easily
by means of encryption technology. In practice, however, the costs would be
high - not just for the cards, but also for the terminals necessary to read
them. Furthermore, if the ID card was multipurpose, the sharing of costs
between parties would be problematic. The preparation for the introduction
of such a card would need to be meticulous.
The government's recent record in overseeing large IT projects has been
poor, yet an ID card of this kind would be as ambitious as any it has
attempted to date. All the more reason, then, not to rush its introduction,
nor to make it obligatory at an early stage.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: University research - for or against
an elitist approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JAMES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a mistake to put forward the division of universities into
research and non-research as a condition for uniformity in the quality of
teaching. On the contrary, research among university staff is a condition
for high-quality teaching.
For individuals and nations, competitiveness in the global economy depends
on the ability to acquire, criticise and produce information at ever
increasing rates of turnover (see FT World Economy &amp; Finance survey,
September 30). This is particularly relevant to the form and content of
research and teaching. Only first-hand experience of an active research
environment can give students the skills relevant to new flows of
information, as opposed to outdated knowledge. For example, it is better to
prepare students for a critical analysis of developments in the EU, than
merely to teach them about the EEC.
Teaching without research lacks the movement necessary for an assimilation
to a world where productive innovation has replaced reproduction as the key
to success.

</HEADLINE>

   From Dr CHRIS DOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'University reform' (October 11), accurately summarised
some of the problems afflicting higher education in the UK. Your proposal to
limit access to research funds to a small group of universities, say 20, is
certainly a way of facilitating an improvement in research quality.
The present system of allocating funds, a much distorted bureaucratic
structure, is encouraging too many universities to compete for a slice of
the limited research budget. In March 1996, departments within UK
universities will be assessed on their research record and this will be a
critical factor determining departmental incomes for several years
thereafter. A consequence of this assessment structure is the dispersal
across universities of staff with good publication records, as low or
non-research rated departments attempt to improve research standings.
While it may seem an appealing strategy to have more facilities undertaking
research, it is leading to a dilution of research resources. To take a
football analogy, it is a bit like distributing some of the star players in
the top teams of the premier division across teams in the lower divisions.
Such a strategy would clearly redress imbalances across the teams, but the
overall quality of matches would undoubtedly suffer. Fortunately, the market
in football prevents this from happening.
The problems besetting British universities are being exacerbated by the
dilution of gifted researchers across a wider base. The resurgence in
English league football has been achieved by adopting an overtly elitist
strategy. It is about time policymakers recognised that gains in research
excellence in British universities can be achieved similarly.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Efficient - but wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE PARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr David Henderson and Mr David Sawers (Letters, October 12) make the
usual mistake of confusing efficiency with effectiveness. The efficient
allocation of resources by UK corporations has led to no indigenous UK car
industry, motorcycle industry or computer industry, a semiconductor industry
on its last legs and a declining industrial base. The UK's European
competitors make this error less often, one of the reasons they are better
off and the UK is now the poor man of Europe.
The application of rationalism to every investment decision (efficiency
above all]) has given rise to the above.
It is unlikely that UK helicopter component manufacturers are any worse or
better in terms of 'efficiency' than their competitors. Thus, the arguments
concerning a 'waste of resources' are fallacious.
Second, generally speaking, items with added value that comes from thought
(helicopters) command a higher price in the market for a given unit of
effort than those that need muscle (coal). Thus, the production of high-tech
products should lead to a wealthier population. I think the Singaporeans
have conclusively proved this.
Efficiency has its place, but don't forget that it is entirely possible
efficiently to do the wrong thing. This is usually avoided by applying
common sense.

FT  14 OCT 94 / A vote on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major could show himself to be the cleverest bastard of them all
today. 'Bastard', you may recall, is the term the prime minister once
famously used to describe the uppity liberal nationalists within his
administration. Several of his superficially loyal lib-nat colleagues have
cast doubt on their own legitimacy this week. They have paid lip service to
the government's carefully constructed position on the development of the
European Union, but their body language has indicated that they do not
believe a word of it. Mr Major could outflank them. He could promise a
referendum on Europe.
Let me explain. All politicians can learn from the speech given by Mr Tony
Blair at the eau-de-nil conference in Blackpool 10 days ago. The Labour
leader painted a picture of where he wanted to take the country. He sounded
honest and straightforward. He capped his peroration with a sizzler. By
undertaking to review the party's constitution, simultaneously translated by
his aides to mean abandoning the socialist Clause 4, Mr Blair convinced his
audience, including some Conservative observers, that he had the stuff of
leadership in him. The honest and straightforward Mr Major could have the
equivalent effect today.
When he addresses the Conservative conference in Bournemouth this afternoon
the prime minister will presumably stick by his European strategy, which is
increasingly Gaullist. Beyond that he could, if he chose, say that his
government would consult the people before throwing sterling into the
melting pot of a single European currency. Monetary union may never happen,
but, he could intimate, if it does Britain's position will be decided by the
electorate. Mr Major's minions could fan out among the media and, nudge
nudge, explain that by 'consult the people' he means a referendum.
There is one immediate snag. The prime minister has repeatedly declared his
opposition to plebiscites, on the ground that decisions should be taken in
Parliament. Against that, he has just conceded a popular vote on the future
of Northern Ireland. It is to his credit that he has done so. His careful
management of the peace process is evidence of how his painstaking attention
to detail, allied to his negotiating skills, can best be deployed. The
declaration signed by Mr Major and his Irish counterpart at Downing Street
before Christmas tied every participant - British, Irish, Northern Irish -
to the principle of self-determination. That alone was worth establishing.
The ceasefire announced by the 'loyalist' terrorists yesterday is evidence
of the declaration's powerful effect.
There is, however, a corollary. Self-determination cannot reasonably be
granted to Ulster and subsequently denied the rest of the country. I have
long argued that the EU is not an embryonic federation, but a casbah of
governments, a permanent session of bargaining among national states. That
proposition could not be sustained if the members of the EU melded their
currencies and placed the management of their economies under the control of
a single central bank. It would be a constitutional leap in the dark of
greater importance than the matter of whether there is a united Ireland or a
self-governing Scotland. Given the prospect of such a tremendous change in
our fortunes, a referendum would be more than politic. It would be right.
Opponents of a national vote always ask what the question would be. This one
is easy. 'Do you want to join the European single currency?' A Yes and we
would be in; a No and we would remain outside. The national debate that
would precede the voting might be more elevated than cynics expect. A
promise that such a question will be asked if the time comes should unite
the Conservatives. It could silence most of the nationalist faction within
the party. It would pre-empt an almost certain decision by Labour to promise
a similar plebiscite if they are el-ected. It might even attract voters'
attention.
Fanatical chauvinists may protest that this is not enough. A referendum in
the wild blue yonder, following, say, the amalgamation of the French franc,
the D-Mark and the Benelux currencies, is too far away, too uncertain. They
want a vote in principle, now. More ambitiously, they want the question to
be 'do you want a federal Europe?' hoping for a No. That would pre-empt what
they fear will be a further erosion of sovereignty following the 1996
inter-governmental conference on the development of the EU. On such matters
the Eurosceptics are, however, divided, the wildest of them postulating a
withdrawal from the Union. They are fighting under their blankets, each
clutching their own nightmare.
Those who would not quieten down after an offer of a single-currency
referendum could, for a while at least, be ignored. Ministers I have spoken
with in Bournemouth show some nervousness about what may be a close vote on
the forthcoming 'own resources' bill on the finances of the EU. Are the
backbench bastards hoping to bring the government down so that they might
capture the party while in opposition? Is Mr Michael Quixote the potential
leader of such a coup? I doubt it. On past form, the schismatics, themselves
divided, will use the tension surrounding the passage of the own resources
bill to extract such sceptical statements as they can from the prime
minister. They picture themselves squeezing Mr Major to the last available
drop, then supporting the government.
Nobody expects the prime minister to announce a referendum this afternoon.
It will be surprising if he does. Yet it is likely that by the time of the
next election all three national parties will be committed to a popular vote
on the EU. The Liberal Democrats are already there, Labour within a whisker
of a decision. As to the outcome, senior ministers I consulted agree that
Britain would probably stay out of a single currency at the start, then,
after a few years, scramble to get in. One, a sceptic who thinks joining a
single currency wrong on principle, accepts that, if the continental
countries create a monetary union that works, we might think again. The
chancellor says 'one day'; others 'never'.
Come to think of it, we may need two plebiscites on a single currency before
the decade is out, the first to say No and the second Yes.

FT  14 OCT 94 / President seizes ball from opposing team: Can Ukraine
achieve the goal of economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ukrainians have been euphoric since last month's victory of their football
team, Kiev Dynamo, over bitter rivals Moscow Spartak. The Dynamo players
have been lionised by a nation hungry for symbols that it is able to
surmount its economic and political problems.
With President Leonid Kuchma's detailed announcement of a comprehensive
economic reform programme earlier this week, some Ukrainians are beginning
to hope that Kiev's government team is also poised to score, after three
years of mismanagement and decline.
Ukraine's plan, bolstered by the nation's first-ever loan agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, concluded late last month, is a belated version
of the radical reforms which have worked in eastern Europe. Mr Kuchma has
promised to liberalise prices, slash the budget deficit, overhaul taxation,
privatise state enterprises, stabilise the currency and eventually peg it to
the US dollar.
'I think the chances for reform are very good,' says Professor Anders
Aslund, a Swedish economist who was an adviser on Russia's attempt at
economic reform and is now advising the Ukrainian president. 'The question
should not be 'Will reforms work in Ukraine?', but 'Why wouldn't reforms
work in Ukraine?' '
Until now, however, Ukraine's parochial political elite, dominated by former
communists, has shown no sign of wanting market reforms. In three years,
this has earned the country a reputation as one of the most mismanaged,
economically backward former Soviet republics.
There has been no mass national conversion to the joys of market economics
since the election of Mr Kuchma in July. But the Ukrainian leadership
appears to have realised that, without economic reforms, Ukraine will not
survive as an independent state.
It is this realisation that seems to have persuaded Mr Kuchma - the former
director of the Soviet Union's largest missile factory who has little
natural affinity for the market - to undertake reforms. To implement them,
he has vested increasing authority in a small, but surprisingly able, group
of reformers.
Three years ago, western journalists were liable to be asked by the Ministry
of Foreign Trade to explain what exactly a balance of trade was. Today,
there are leaders in senior positions able intelligently to discuss money
supply and the budget deficit when IMF teams come to Kiev.
These young supporters of the market economy are outnumbered, and could yet
be overpowered, by post-communist time-servers, who oppose reforms because
they do not understand them. There are also communist politicians who are
resisting a radical reshaping of Ukraine.
The prime minister, Mr Vitalii Masol, a hold-over from the previous
administration, has reluctantly gone along with Mr Kuchma's programme, but
he could lead a future conservative backlash.
The Ukrainian parliament elected this spring could prove a more formidable
obstacle to economic reform. It is dominated by MPs who ran on communist or
socialist tickets and are opposed to reform.
Mr Kuchma has threatened to override the legislature if it tries to block
his reform programme, a threat that appears to have worked with Mr Oleksandr
Moroz, the socialist speaker of parliament, who this week glowingly endorsed
the reform plan.
Mr Kuchma has a powerful ally in the increasingly powerful businessmen of
eastern Ukraine - ironically the region that elected the bulk of the
hard-liners. They openly boast of their intention to bribe or coerce their
local communist MPs into backing reforms.
In some respects, the economic challenges are less daunting than the
political challenges. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, who advised Poland on its
'shock therapy' market reforms, points out that Ukraine's previous
administration had already administered much of the shock which accompanied
reforms in other post-communist economies. With industrial production having
declined, there are fewer inefficient factories left to close. And an
unofficial private economy, accounting for perhaps more than half of
economic activity, has been created in reaction to the suffocating net of
state regulations.
The Ukrainian central bank - in contrast to the Russian central bank - has
pursued a tight monetary policy since the beginning of the year and has not
been handing out credits to industry and agriculture. Unfortunately, the
counter-inflationary effects of this have been undermined by the
government's large budget deficit.
But pushing Ukraine into the market will be no easy task. Part of the
problem is its size: Ukraine has a population almost as large as Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic combined. It has also inherited a
disproportionate share of the former Soviet Union's defence sector, which is
difficult to convert to more market-oriented production.
Furthermore, Ukraine's dependence on Russian oil and gas has contributed
Dollars 1bn to the country's debt. Negotiations to reschedule the existing
debt - which depend on Russia's questionable goodwill towards its defiantly
independent neighbour - must be successful for reforms to succeed.
'The chance that Ukraine will adopt a market reform programme is very high,'
says Mr Daniel Kaufmann, the Kiev representative for the World Bank. 'But to
implement those reforms and sustain them, Ukraine will require enormous
western financial support.'
That support would help cushion Ukrainians from the initially devastating
effects of the reforms, which have already led to a collapse of the national
currency and could push the inflation rate up to 60 per cent this month,
from 2.9 per cent in August. Without it, the fragile political consensus for
change could shatter.
This summer in Naples, leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations
pledged Dollars 4bn if Ukraine were to embark on serious market reforms. At
the time, it was an easy promise to make: Ukraine was in the middle of
contentious presidential elections and the economy appeared to be in free
fall.
Now that Ukraine seems to have mustered the political resolve to take up the
G7's challenge, the question is whether the G7 will find the political will
to respond.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Positive tradition perverted by
corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OLUSEGUN OBASANJO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Holman's incisive piece on global corruption and the work of
Transparency International (Survey of World Economy and Finance, September
30) is wholly commendable. So, too, is Peter Norman's comment ('IMF/World
Bank in Madrid: Lesson in north-south row', October 5) that industrialised
countries must respond to the growing economic importance of developing
countries as these become increasingly integrated in the world economy; that
'ideological differences' that used to divide north and south have largely
disappeared.
There is one particular 'ideological difference' that needs a much better
appreciation - the myth in the north that a traditional culture of
appreciation and hospitality fosters corrupt practices.
I can speak only for Africa. But what holds true in my own continent may
apply in other parts of the developing world. I shudder at how an integral
part of my continent's culture can be taken as a basis for rationalising
otherwise despicable behaviour. In the African concept of appreciation and
hospitality, a gift is a token; it is not demanded; the value is in the
spirit of the giving, not the material worth. The gift is made in the open
for all to see, never in secret. Where a gift is excessive it becomes an
embarrassment, and is returned.
If anything, corruption - as practised by exporters from the north as well
as by officials in the south - has perverted positive aspects of this
age-old tradition.
It is suggested, too, that African society corrupts the public office holder
by placing excessive demands and expectations on 'the big chief'; that he is
expected to have infinite resources to dish out freely to all and sundry.
Again, such an argument bears little relationship to reality and is merely
the escape route of the corrupt public officer.
Finally, it is said that corruption is the product of poverty. Poverty may
play a part, but it can hardly be the root cause. Witness the sharp
practices that have characterised the banking industry in Nigeria in recent
years. Most bank officials were more than well paid, yet their fraudulent
and corrupt practices have been outrageous. Contrast these with other
officials, much less well paid, who have maintained their integrity and
incorruptibility throughout.
Let us all strip away excuses and explanations. In no society - north, south
or east - is it acceptable to the people for their leaders to feather their
own nests at public expense. Once this simple truth is widely accepted, more
meaningful social and economic development will follow.

Sir, Your report of the Taiwanese stock market controversy ('Minister to

by this company in a new textile plant in Northern Ireland.
We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the principal objections
of the European textile industry to the investment lie in the provision of
Pounds 61m of assistance by the UK government to build a new plant in a
sector in which there is already an excess manufacturing capacity within the
EU.
The industry has also voiced concern that the estimated number of jobs to be
created by the investment is unsubstantiated by the information which has
been publicly disclosed; furthermore, any benefit to Northern Ireland in
employment terms is likely to be at the expense of jobs in other parts of
the UK.
Surely, in the light of these objections and the expected investigations by
the Taiwanese authorities, the government should reconsider its support for
the project, which is opposed by such a wide spectrum of textile interests,
both in the UK and throughout the European Union.
Meantime, the European textile industry is preparing its appeal to the
European Court of Justice.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: A keyboard athlete - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of his comparatively short recital at the Wigmore Hall on
Wednesday evening, Andrei Gavrilov gave a friendly wave and said 'I'd love
to play more, but really the piano is very tired'. He had just given a
blistering account of the hectic finale of Prokofiev's Eighth Sonata.
How else can you play it? Yet Gavrilov is not the beefy tyro he once was,
and some his discs lately have shown a more thoughtful, mellow side of his
musical make-up; his recording of Schubert's Impromptus, for instance.
Three from the later set opened this recital, beginning with the Theme and
Variations in B flat, which were warm and relaxed, with almost casual,
though fleet, articulation in the last variation. In the second Impromptu in
A flat, Gavrilov seemed to have slight trouble keeping dynamics on an
intimate level, though it sounded as if he was holding down the left pedal
the whole way through. In the last, dance-like piece, with its sudden, wild
swirls, he actually ignored some of Schubert's quiet dynamics, not that the
effect was anything but entirely natura1.
Ravel's Gaspard de la Nuit is a macabre triptych with a reputation for some
of the most horrendous technical difficulties in the entire piano
literature. Yet it is full of delicate, crepuscular halflights and shadows;
the whole of the second piece, Le gibet, is quiet and so is much of the
first, Ondine. The player's problems were mainly to do with intricate
textures and balance, and while Gavrilov was strong on colour and
atmosphere, the mind-boggling details of Ondine sounded a bit approximate.
He took Le gibet quite fluently, allowing the pulse a bit of elasticity.
Scarbo, the spookiest and most violent piece, was swept forwards with
compelling brutality and if the outlines of its grotesque and jagged forms
were a bit smudged, at least the spirit was right.
After the interval, the wild toccata-like sections of Prokofiev's Eighth
Sonata seemed mere child's play to this natural keyboard athlete. But the
first movement alternates brilliant, propulsive music with oddly
sour-flavoured slower sections, whose air of unease Gavrilov rather
underplayed, so that the effect was almost offhand, or absent-minded. The
sleepy middle movement lulled us effectively before the onslaught of the
finale, which ended with something not far short of a punch to the bottom of
the keyboard, as almost at once, Gavrilov leapt to his feet to show us he
had well and truly won that battle.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: Battle with the Philharmonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leonard Slatkin's programme with the Philharmonia Orchestra on Wednesday
seemed at first sight to have been a hotch-potch tailored to the strengths
of the evening's soloist, Kathleen Battle. In the event, even its light
demands showed up the American diva unfavourably.
Hers is a small voice unsuited to the open spaces of the Royal Festival
Hall, and indulgent patrons seated towards the back may have been happy to
make allowances for her distinctly underwhelming projection, even against
the reduced size of the orchestra in the opening work of the evening,
Mozart's Exsultate jubilate. But Battle's boring vocal display  - she
employed a single tone colour and maintained one mezzo-forte-ish dynamic -
across the contrasting moods of the motet was less excusable, especially at
moments of wayward intonation. In spite of her starry international status,
this was singing easily bettered (almost) any night of the week up the road
at English National Opera. The Overture to Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail -
even in Slatkin's middle-of-the-road Mozart manner - restored spirits a
little.
But they were quickly dampened again, by the first British performance of
Andre Previn's song cycle Honey and Rue. Commissioned by the Carnegie Hall
for its centenary in 1992, the six songs were apparently conceived with
Battle's voice in mind. Previn, wisely, makes no demands on the soprano's
lowest register, but his music has a resolute predictability about it.
Though the score - sub-Copland with infusions of jazz - has perhaps more
substance than most of Previn's music, the composer responds to Toni
Morrison's bittersweet poetry with only the most obvious of orchestral
effects. The unaccompanied, spiritual-like fourth song, 'Do you know him?',
calls for an earthiness lacking in Battle's tone.
After interval, Slatkin, having paid respects to his fellow conductor, found
in Mahler's First Symphony something to sink his teeth into. London is not
starved for Mahler at present - the London Symphony Orchestra's Mahler
Festival forges ahead at the Barbican - but there is always room for more
performances of distinction. Though the first movement was slow in springing
to life, most of Slatkin's account was invigorating and up-front. He dug
deeply into the Landler rhythms, revelled in the third movement's
intoxicating Zigeuner cafe music. The excitement here all but dispelled the
torpor of the evening's first half.
Kathleen Battle sings with the Philharmonia at The Anvil, Basingstoke, on
Saturday.

Tomorrow's World has always been a gee-whiz programme appealing particularly
to children, but one characteristic made it attractive to anyone interested
in broadcasting: it was presented live. This meant fizz and adrenalin, and
that things could, and did, go wrong, a fact which could pull you in whether
or not you were interested in widgets. Now, after nearly 30 years, they have
finally chickened out and decided that, like everyone else, they will have a
little collection of pre-packaged filmlets. Safety at last - but for me not
worth watching any more (7.30 BBC1). Second Thoughts reaches its last
episode without ever having impinged upon me more than incidentally:
whenever I caught sight I thought 'Oh another sitcom about people not
married to one another trying to live together'. Since it never passed the
test of making me laugh within three minutes of switching on I never watched
a whole episode (8.30 ITV). Conversely, anything starring Alexei Sayle
receives instant attention. Paris is a new comedy series in which he plays
French artist Alain Degout in the 1920s (9.30 C4).

FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: What a Performance - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some things pass away forever, leaving not a wrack nor even a half-way
decent video behind. It seems, for instance, that the performing greatness
of comedian Sid Field now lives only in the memory of the second world war
generation. His films were flops. He died - from a heart attack in 1950 at
the tragically young age of 45 - before the rise of television; but by all
accounts his was an act that relied on sheer presence. Illustrious
commentators - Peter Ustinov, John Osborne, Chaplin himself - agree that
Field was the funniest clown of all. From such of his scripts as survive and
from the facts of his brief life, William Humble has put together an
agreeable portrait-show called What a Performance, directed by Roger Redfarn
and designed by Paul Farnsworth, which searches for the secret of Field's
greatness.
David Suchet takes the main role and first of all we see him in his own
person in a dressing-room set surrounded by the blackness of the bare stage,
as he puts on his wig and recites those brief facts: obscure birth in
Birmingham, childhood on the stage, quarter-century yoked by rotten
contracts to the provincial circuit, six explosive years as the biggest star
in the West End with an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance, then
burn-out and transformation into a legend, the last of the great music-hall
comedians.
Bewigged and sparkling, a cheekie chappie with a Brum accent, Suchet stays
in role from now on, as a sequence of biographical vignettes unfolds with
set-piece comic routines and songs interpolated. We see little Sid's primal
scene of instruction: a suburban tea-table at which his iron-willed
theatrical mother is holding forth while the lad pours tea in a long stream
down to a cup held on the floor by his Dad (Clive Panto), a redundant
whip-maker with a relentless sense of humour who chooses to live under the
table. Soon widowed, Marilyn Cutt's Bertha follows her son around the
country, organising his career like an implacable Mary Poppins with richly
rolled Birmingham 'r's.
It is as a mother-fixated son, a timid negotiator of contracts, a husband
turning his ear against responsibility like his ostrich-father, that we are
shown the Sid Field behind the gags. But the gags keep coming in again, and
they get Sid to heaven, at any rate, in this not very deeply pondered
exploration of his soul. Those gags were always valued for not being
'questionable' - and one does derive from the show a sense of the innocent
gutsy humour of a bygone year - but they must have been quite camp if
Suchet's performance is accurate. He is forever slipping into his pansy
voice and does not, indeed, stop short of the questionable innuendo.
But he wins the day with his skilful patter and athletic slapstick. He flies
back and forth across the stage, beautifully avoiding a strategic banana in
the palsied butler sketch (done as a lurid caricature worthy of Spitting
Image) and one is lost in admiration for the slick acting ability of his
tongue in the wide-mouthed frog routine. The interesting irony of What a
Performance, which is all about the theatre and guys the kind of West-End
first night that we were actually attending, is that even if the comedy
routines went wrong, it would only be part of the play. Given Suchet's
virtuosity and the dry brilliance of Christopher Godwin's splendidly lean,
tall, straight man, Jerry Desmonde, there is little danger of that.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Arts: Major ballets resurrected - New productions of
Ashton's 'Enigma Variations' and Massine's 'Le Tricorne'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Birmingham Royal Ballet has begun its new season with the acquisition of two
major works: Ashton's Enigma Variations and Massine's Le Tricorne. This is a
welcome extension of Peter Wright's policy of rescuing important ballets
from repertory oblivion. The recent staging of Choreartium was significant
in reminding audiences of Massine's stature.
There are other Massine works, ballets by Ashton, Tudor, MacMillan, Lichine
 -and how many more - which merit such new life. The Tate Gallery aspect of
such care - 20th century masterpieces kept on show for us - should be a
vital aspect of BRB's identity.
Not surprisingly, Enigma Variations came up very well at Tuesday night's
first performance. The cast understood Ashton's loving homage to Elgar's
world, with its nostalgic haze of golden autumnal light - such days as we
are currently enjoying - warmed by late sun and much emotion. All honour to
Michael Somes, great Ashtonian, who has mounted the ballet impeccably. It is
also a tribute to the exceptional quality of BRB's artists as an ensemble of
dance-actors. Technical style may be sometimes mousey; the playing of roles,
as we see here, is authoritative.
Enigma is, superficially, a series of vignette portraits done by a master -
and assembled by a master into something far greater then its brief parts,
with Ashton, like Elgar, able to evoke a social world and the feelings that
sustain it with subtlest skill. With a couple of exceptions - Troyte like a
man beset by hornets - the portraits are ideally done. I salute Desmond
Kelly's life-like Elgar, true and commanding focus of the action, and the
serene beauty of Sherilyn Kennedy's view of his wife.
The work's emotional heart - the scenes with Alain Dubreuil's sincere,
acutely judged Jaeger - was perfectly shown. Very touching, too, Sandra
Madgwick as a mercurial Dorabella (coached, I'd venture, by Antoinette
Sibley, the enchanting original) and Catherine Batcheller's noble Mary
Lygon. The sense, throughout, is of a ballet honoured because understood.
And I record with pleasure that Leslie Edwards is returned to the role of
Nevinson which he created, and that his precision of playing is as rewarding
as ever.
About Tricorne my feelings are rather mixed. It is important that this
masterpiece be seen, but it is increasingly difficult to find dancers who
look as essentially Spanish and as stylish as Massine's dances demand, and
as the Picasso designs and the de Falla score postulate.
When the piece first came to the Royal repertory in 1947, Massine was on
hand to galvanise the cast, and to show in his own performance the psychic
and physical energies needed. (It was significant that the best interpreter
of the Miller's Wife was the Bolshoi-trained Violetta Elvin, who brought a
blaze of physical beauty and temperament to the dances.)
On Tuesday, BRB's artists had still to come to terms with the piece: there
was more sang-froid than hot blood on view. It is not a polite ballet, not
in theme - sexual jealousy as comedy - nor in step, score or design. It must
have the furia we see with Cumbre Flamenca, controlled but not diminished by
balletic rule.
BRB show it as some sort of Hispanic charade. Joseph Cipolla - who has the
heart of the matter in him - came alive as the Miller when the dramatic
temperature started to rise. Monica Zamora, very lovely, needs a dress, and
emotions, of a deeper shade: let her trust her Spanish blood rather than her
Baron's Court training. The neighbours look extinguished under the marvels
of their costumes, vivid patterns and colours framing bun-faces and a
general air of wishing they were in Frinton rather than Andalucia. (They
should adopt a darker, bolder make-up, and the manner to go with it).
But Tricorne is a masterpiece, worthy of every effort to capture its style.
It must not be neglected, nor allowed to remain in its present deep-frozen
state. It has been revived by Lorca Massine - and what has happened to the
little kite that the Dandy used to fly? - its score, like the Elgar
variations, played with strong theatrical sense by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia
under Barry Wordsworth. The Tricorne production was sponsored by British
Land. The programme was completed by David Bintley's Galanteries.
Birmingham Royal Ballet plays this triple bill again on October 21, 22; then
tours it to Edinburgh, Bradford, Bristol, Plymouth until November 26. Check
local theatres for dates.

Wilson Sporting Goods of the US has launched a 'revolutionary' new golf ball
which, it says, improves performance by 'optimising interaction between
opposing aerodynamic forces of drag and lift', writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
Borrowing design principles developed in the NASA space programme, Wilson's
Ultra ball has a new dimple pattern and 100 more dimples than the average
ball, which has 400. Ultra's dimples, arranged in a 'geodesic icosahedral'
pattern of 60 spherical triangles, create a more symmetrical surface to
achieve higher velocity and more stable flight, the designers say.
The ball, which sells for about Dollars 36 per dozen, comes with different
combinations of dimples depending on whether you are going for distance, low
trajectory or high trajectory.

A laser treatment that stops snoring has been launched in the UK after
successful application in the US. The 'Swiftlaser' is used to trim the uvula
at the back of the throat to stop vibrations that cause snoring.
The treatment, carried out under local anaesthetic, would replace scalpel
surgery under general anaesthetic. The only side-effect is a mild sore
throat, according to the Harley Medical Group, introducing the treatment in
the UK.
In the US, where 12,000 snorers have been treated, Harley Medical says the
success rate is 85 per cent to 90 per cent. Nearly a third of US patients
were cured after one visit, while about two-thirds needed further sessions.
The treatment may also be appropriate for some sleep apnoea sufferers. The
cost is between Pounds 450 and Pounds 950, depending on the number of
visits.

Matsushita has unveiled a CD-ROM drive that reads CD-ROM (read only memory)
disks at quadruple speed, and can also write, erase and rewrite up to 650
megabytes of data onto optical disks, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
Matsushita has received or applied for 88 international patents on the
drive's 'phase-change' recording technique, which reversibly alters the
structure of the disk.
Users can transfer data from CD-ROM onto disk, edit the data, and read it at
almost the same speed as from the CD-ROM.
Matsushita is likely to start selling the new drive next year, probably
under the Panasonic imprint.
The new drive, which uses 120mm disks, is likely to be priced at around
Y100,000 (Pounds 630).

Owens-Corning, America's biggest producer of fibreglass, claims the first
big breakthrough in the product for almost 60 years, writes Tony Jackson in
New York.
Its new Miraflex fibreglass, used for domestic insulation, has a quarter of
the bulk of the conventional product and costs less to make.
The result of years of research and Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) investment,
Miraflex is hedged around by over 30 patent applications. The process fuses
two types of glass into a single filament. As it cools it twists randomly,
making a soft fleece similar to cotton.
This packs into much thinner and lighter rolls, saving space for the
retailer and reducing transport costs by 75 per cent.
The process dispenses with two elements of conventional manufacture:
chemicals to bind the straight fibres and ovens to heat and set the fibre
after chemical treatment. This saves on raw materials and cuts the capital
cost of the plant by 15-20 per cent, according to Owens-Corning.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology: Branching out - Remote facilities are on the way
in the US as a traditional banking alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If bank branches are going out of fashion, you would not know it. For years,
pundits have argued that advances in information technology, the falling
price of home computers and an increasing willingness of people to conduct
their financial dealings from home or the office would make trips to the
bank a thing of the past. Yet there are 56,000 bank branches in the US, and
the number is still rising at around 1,500 a year.
But the future is arriving. Low- and high-tech devices - telephones and
automated teller machines to screen telephones and private information
networks - are combining to provide a wide range of access points to bank
services.
The advent of interactive television (the first wide-scale experiment is due
to start in Orlando, Florida before the end of the year) will open up
another potential avenue. This medium will give viewers greater control over
the information being fed to them, enabling them, for instance, to request a
particular movie or search a database attached to the system. It could also
be adapted for real-time financial transactions, whether paying a bill or
requesting account information.
'People have already been moving away from branches,' says Eugene Lockhart,
head of MasterCard, the international payments group. In the US, according
to a study by Lockhart last year for the Bank Administration Institute in
the US, more banking transactions are being conducted outside a bank branch
than in one. The study found that 31 per cent of transactions are dealt
through an automated teller machine and 24 per cent are handled over a
telephone.
The next stage of remote banking is coming fast. Earlier this month,
Citibank launched a full-scale assault on the Washington DC market with a
range of services to enable customers to tap into their accounts in a number
of ways. It included a full telephone service, a software programme for use
on PCs and a card telephone (a telephone with a small screen and card-reader
attached.)
Finding better ways of getting to their customers has become the biggest
single factor in US retail banks' spending on technology, according to a
study by Andersen Consulting. Around Dollars 1bn (Pounds 630m) of the
Dollars 2.1bn they expect to spend in the next three years will be invested
in delivery channels, says Daniel Pfau, a consultant at Andersen. Of that,
Dollars 270m will be spent on automated services, Dollars 176m on improving
telephone-based services and Dollars 146m on home banking.
Citibank's New York rival, Chase Manhattan, will launch a new home banking
product of its own next month. And it is putting more resources into
telephone-based services. Around a fifth of Chase's transactions take place
over the telephone already, says Sue Webb, senior vice-president in Chase
Manhattan's retail bank.
'It's not about one channel, or one product, being better than another,' she
says. 'It's enabling customers to access you through multiple channels and
multiple products.'
The success of such products will depend on the quality of information
available on the desktops of bank staff, whether at the end of a telephone
or in a branch. Victor Menezes, in charge of consumer branch banking at
Citibank in Europe and the US agrees: 'You have to make sure you have a
robust customer system.'
Are the banks moving in the right direction, and are they moving fast
enough? That depends on three other factors. First, the future role of
branches. At the moment, even banks which are investing heavily in other
channels still regard branches as central to their business.
Second, most senior bankers have come through the branch system, and their
institutions remain dominated by branch bankers. These people contrast
sharply with the product managers and technologists who increasingly
dominate thinking. Bankers confess to some tensions, but claim to be dealing
with them.
Third, are banks falling behind the competition? The competition includes a
host of other financial services companies, such as credit card companies,
mutual fund groups and finance companies. Typically, these are based around
a single product or group of products. By centralising sales efforts and not
having branch overheads, they generally run on lower costs.
'We think the trend is going to be towards low-cost, direct (services),'
says Roger Servison, head of retail marketing at Fidelity Investments, the
biggest mutual funds group in the US.
Fidelity already has a number of channels available to customers, including
a touchphone service which allows customers to handle transactions over the
telephone without talking to an operator, and a software programme already
used by 40,000 account holders and gaining 2,000 more a month.
Fidelity is also involved in the interactive television venture in Orlando.
It plans to to plug into as many households as possible. Even if people do
not use the Fidelity system to buy a Fidelity product, says Servison, they
could use it to access someone else's. 'We'd like to become the financial
network to the networks.'
This could be worrying for the banks. After all, what use are smart,
high-tech branches if your target customers are busy plugging into another
system altogether?

FT  14 OCT 94 / Technology: Work hazards that irritate / A look at
protective measures against occupational skin diseases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertisers of creams, soaps and protective lotions bombard the consumer
with warnings about the ravages that age, sun and dishwashing can wreak on
the skin.
But few warn of the hazards at work.
According to Richard Rycroft, author of the Textbook of Contact Dermititis,
occupational skin diseases cost US companies between Dollars 222m (Pounds
150m) and Dollars 1bn year through lost productivity, medical care and
disability payments.
Recently US researchers have published studies on the effects of
occupational irritants on the skin.
In the UK, the disease accounts for the loss of 7m working days a year. Now
Carolyn Willis, senior scientist in the department of Dermatology at
Amersham Hospital in the UK is leading a research project to investigate the
relationship between allergies and susceptibility to irritants.
The research is being funded by the British Occupational Health Research
Foundation, a charity set up in 1991 to investigate medical issues directly
related to the workplace. It brings together industry and the academic
sector to sponsor research with practical application to employers.
Substances used by workers in industrial sectors from mining to hairdressing
can pose dermatological risks.
Obvious culprits include acids, oxidizing agents and petroleum products, but
even constant exposure to water or an over-humid office atmosphere can cause
what is medically known as irritant contact dermititis, the most prevalent
form of occupational skin disease.
Symptoms include redness, swelling, blisters, dryness, itching, stinging,
burning and thickening of the skin. The disease can be acute - when one
contact with an irritant induces a reaction; or chronic - where the reaction
evolves over a period of exposure. For those suffering from allergies such
as eczema, asthma or hay fever, the damage can be even more severe.
Employers can offer protective gloves, clothing or medicated creams, but
none of these are entirely effective as not enough is known about the
disease, says Willis.
Willis has enlisted 70 'healthy' male volunteers for the project and applied
six frequently used workplace chemicals such as solvents, detergents, acids
and alkalis to their skin.
Willis will study the effects of the chemicals under the microscope, with
the aim of developing better protective and therapeutic measures. 'Since a
lot of companies are going to have a difficult time preventing their workers
from being exposed to these chemicals, the development of effective
protection is very important,' she says.
The irritant contact dermititis research is one of four projects which is
being sponsored by the BOHRF.
David McWilliam, director general of the BOHRF, says the work should be most
useful in the sorts of research that individual companies may be unable to
afford.
'Many companies are already spending a lot of money in directly funded
research on problems specific to those companies,' he said. 'Where there is
a big gap is in conditions that have a very general impact - like irritant
contact dermititis - where no one company could afford to research it.
'We give them the means to club together and pay a modest amount for what is
very important research.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / People: Guignard quits Greycoat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The expected board shake-out at Greycoat, the property developer rescued
from the brink of collapse almost a year ago, was announced yesterday,
perhaps rather sooner than had been thought.
However, according to Michael Beckett, who became non-executive chairman in
September: 'The sooner you do these things, the better. It is the final
stage of the group's refinancing and restructuring process, which has been
going on for a period of time. This now cements it.'
Richard Guignard, 52, and for the past three years a managing director, is
retiring from the board in an atmosphere of 'no animosity', according to
Beckett.
It was Guignard who 'was responsible for conceiving and implementing the
successful financial restructuring in 1993'. His settlement is Pounds 75,000
gross, with no extras; his salary had been Pounds 180,000.
John Weir, like Guignard with the company since 1982, has also stepped down
as an executive. He will continue to oversee the US operation 'until the
properties there are sold or transferred, probably spring next year', says
Beckett.
On the non-executive side, George Constantinidi, interim chairman until the
arrival of Beckett, and George Pitt have resigned, to be replaced by Stephen
James and David Tucker.
James recently retired as senior partner of Simmons &amp; Simmons, the City law
firm; he also has extensive property involvement. Tucker was a former deputy
managing director of M&amp;G Group and therefore 'knows the City and City
practice', according to Beckett.
Julian Treger and Brian Myerson, the South African financiers credited with
the resuscitation of the company and made non-executive directors in the
light of the 12.44 per cent shareholding of their vehicle, will remain as
non-executives. However, Treger will resign in March, when he and Myerson
will become alternate directors.

All change at the Radio Authority, which licenses and regulates Britain's

the chairmanship to Sir Peter Gibbings, 65, former chairman of both The
Guardian Media group and Anglia Television.
The news of Lord Chalfont's departure comes less than a fortnight after the
authority's chief executive, Peter Baldwin, 67, announced that he planned to
take early retirement. He will leave next June, six months earlier than
planned. Sir Peter, who takes over the Pounds 46,590 a year part-time job on
January 1, will inherit a vastly expanded commercial radio network. Over the
next year or so commercial radio is expected to take a majority share of
total UK listening from the BBC for the first time.

FT  14 OCT 94 / People: More Bodies on Shop board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Natural cosmetics retailer Body Shop International has appointed its first
non-executive directors, in a move to strengthen its board as the company
becomes a global retailer.
They are Penny Hughes, 35, president of Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland,
and Aldo Papone, 62, former chairman and chief executive of the
travel-related services arm of American Express, who is still a senior
adviser to Amex.
Body Shop said in August, when it changed the role of company founder Anita
Roddick from group managing director to chief executive, and appointed
Stuart Rose as MD - and before the recent round of criticism of the group's
'green' credentials - that it planned to take on non-executives.
It did not want these to be 'token' directors to satisfy corporate
governance guidelines, but people who could genuinely contribute to the
business.
Rose says the company has achieved that with its new appointments. Penny
Hughes, he says, has particular experience in franchise management, an
important issue for Body Shop. President of Coca-Cola GB and Ireland since
1992, she joined the company in 1984 from a marketing role with the Milk
Marketing Board.
Aldo Papone, says Rose, has a reputation in the US as a 'marketing guru'
after 20 years' involvement in developing the American Express brand image.
He began his career with Macy's department store group in 1956, and rose to
general merchandising director, before joining Amex in 1974 as president of
the travel division.
His appointment strengthens the links between Amex and Body Shop; Anita
Roddick appeared recently in TV advertising for the American Express card.
Rose says Body Shop is still looking for more non-executive directors but
will not give a number. 'We are looking for high-calibre people from diverse
backgrounds,' he says. One ideally would be an industrial entrepreneur with
international experience, another would have wide human resources
experience.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Management: How to recognise the British ex-pat - Executives
who choose to live overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the many consequences of the empire is that the emigrant British
diaspora is amazingly widespread. Some countries such as the US, Australia
and South Africa may have millions of British passport holders, a good
percentage of whom regard themselves as ex-pats.
The ex-pats can be found at the country club famous for its cheap gin and
faithful retainers. But they can also be found in the local church, the
Rotarians, the Women's Institute and the British Council. Others prefer
either to blend in with the locals or keep to themselves.
But how do the British adapt to living and working abroad? Are they uniquely
effective ex-pats or is it true that, like American jokes and Bulgarian
wine, they do not travel well?
An ex-pat is usually defined as someone who makes the decision to live and
work abroad.
Many do not plan to be ex-pats but then find themselves in the role. How do
they change over time?
It seems that various ways of adapting are open to them. These different
styles may change over time and indeed they may be more common in some
countries than others. But most are immediately recognisable.
Upwardly Mobile. These ex-pats soon discover that with some technical
training, a western education, English fluency and a white skin they are top
of the pecking order.
In demographic speak a C2 is treated like an A or B socio-economic group
member. Instead of being a servant, one has servants; instead of taking
orders one gives them. Return becomes unthinkable because it means downward
mobility.
Sojourners. This group is more pragmatic with a long-term plan. They are
abroad for a specific goal and usually a set time period. It may be to
accrue capital to pay off a mortgage, or it may be to do one's duties in the
company and earn promotion on return.
They are strictly not ex-pats but are temporary sojourners on a foreign
posting, although they usually mix with the ex-pats.
Nomads. These are sequential sojourners in the sense that they pitch their
tent in one country after another, apparently aimlessly. A new pasture seems
all they are after for they follow no long-term plan. But the longer they
are abroad the harder it is to go home. They are condemned to being the
wandering albatrosses of the ex-pat world.
Financially Trapped. This group has stayed too long at a place in decline.
They do not have the option to return home because they are tied into a
pension plan and indeed a weak economy. The financially trapped may be found
in badly managed, newly independent countries where the currency has been
chronically devalued. They cannot move or go home because they have no
capital. Gone Troppo. This refers to the long-term ex-pats who have gone
native. It is, of course, much more than becoming thoroughly acquainted with
the language, the dress codes and the norms of the natives but a rejection
of one's own values.
It can sometimes look pathetic and may be induced as much by a love of
alcohol and adultery as the values and behavioural norms of the local
culture.
The Never Lefts. The most odd reaction is that of the ex-pats who behave as
if they have never left Sunningdale. They may be marooned in a tropical
paradise, but they are slavishly faithful to their old way of dress, food,
social behaviour. They maintain the style and preferences of the country
they left which now no longer exists.
In some places the ex-pats exist as if nothing has changed since the great
days of the empire. They are happy to be abroad so long as the natives are
waiters and drivers. They may have a deeply ambivalent attitude to the
mother country and the thought of coming home.
To re-pat the ex-pat is indeed a significant challenge.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill McLennan, the lively Australian director of the Central Statistical
Office and Head of the Government Statistical Service, is leaving to become
Australian Statistician. McLennan, 52, who joined the CSO in 1992 after
serving as deputy director of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, brought a
breath of fresh air into the operations of the statistical service. During
his time in office he has sought to tighten up government leaks of
information, develop a stronger business focus and make the CSO more
self-financing. The changes have significantly boosted the credibility of
the CSO in the City, although his forthright and colourful style has
occasionally seemed at odds with British Civil Service traditions.
'I found the culture change bigger than I expected - it took me 12 months to
realise all the subtle cultural differences,' McLennan says.
McLennan, one of the highest-paid civil servants, will leave the CSO in
March after serving out his three-year contract. He said yesterday that he
had decided to return to the post of director of the ABS, which he first
joined in 1960, because he wished to 'go home' and be closer to his two
children. 'It's a great job - not the sort I am ever likely to be offered
again,' he said.
His post, which commanded a salary of Pounds 114,000 this year, will be
advertised shortly.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Management: Trying to keep it in the family / A look at the
steps taken by a Brazilian company determined not to become a takeover
victim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Brazilian pension funds recently snapped up Perdigao, a family-owned
meat and poultry company, its main rival Sadia Concordata could afford to
look on with more than a hint of self satisfaction.
While Perdigao's owners, the Brandalise family, were forced to sell their
company in August after running up a large debt, Sadia has pushed through
important changes in an attempt to professionalise the relationship between
the family owners and the company's management.
As in many other Brazilian family companies, Sadia's reforms were prompted
by the death of its founder. Attilio Fontana, the son of an Italian
immigrant, died in 1989 leaving the company in the hands of nine different
family groups but without a clear power structure.
This has become a common problem as many Brazilian companies were founded by
European immigrants or their offspring - mainly Italian, Portuguese or
German - during the country's rapid industrial growth of the 1950s and
1960s. In recent years many of those founders have died, provoking bitter
rows among heirs that sometimes end up in long-running legal battles for
control.
At the same time, the cosy world of many Brazilian companies has ended with
falling import duties leading to increased foreign competition.
These two trends have resulted in a growing number of family companies being
sold to investment banks or multinationals. Last year some 330 of them were
taken over, compared with just 35 a decade ago, according to management
consultant Renato Bernhoeft, who expects the number to reach 400 this year.
The changes at Sao Paulo-based Sadia, which has sales of Dollars 1.7bn
(Pounds 1.13bn) and 32,000 workers, began to take shape after Attilio
Fontana's death. Fontana created Sadia during the second world war and when
he died 85 per cent of the firm's shares went to some 50 heirs in nine
family groups.
Company bosses realised that frictions between the different families
combined with low profitability and the firm's top heavy management
structure were threatening to undermine the business.
The problem was that traditionally only a few family members with senior
management jobs had influence on company strategy. With the death of the
founder that situation could not continue and old resentments surfaced as
some relatives complained about being excluded from company affairs.
According to chairman Luiz Furlan, a grandson of Attilio Fontana, what was
needed was a shareholding structure that would allow all the family groups
to feel involved. The system should also create a clear separation between
the status of shareholder and manager as well as lay the foundations for a
management restructuring.
'We were determined to turn Sadia into a highly professional and
international company that could take advantage of growing export
opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur free-trade area,' says Furlan.
The company called in Bernhoeft to advise on changes. After discussion among
the various family groups a shareholders' agreement was signed and from the
beginning of last year a new shareholders board, a kind of family council,
began meeting.
A representative from each of the nine family groups attends fortnightly
council meetings that discuss company strategy. The council acts as a
two-way communication channel between the families and the company. The
council is also responsible for relations with the media and the important
role, in Brazil's highly regulated environment, of relations with the
federal and state governments.
Under Fontana the board of directors had been made up of sons, nephews and
other relatives holding executive positions in Sadia.
Bernhoeft says the council idea is drawn from some developments in family
companies in continental Europe, from where many founders of Brazilian
companies emigrated, but is not based on any specific model. 'The idea is
that the council initially serves as a forum for resolving family problems
and then evolves more into a board supervising the company's operations,' he
says.
It took a year of discussions to create the new council and shareholders'
agreement as a lot of suspicions between family groups had to be overcome,
Furlan claims.
The shareholders' agreement is the rulebook underpinning the new structure.
It attempts to defuse potential problems by detailing the process for family
members that want to sell their stake, as well as laying down rules intended
to prevent family executives taking advantage of their position as
shareholders by, for example, using company chauffeurs for non-business
activities.
These reforms have been accompanied by a gradual replacement of family
members in senior positions and, earlier this year, by a broad management
restructuring that reduced the number of executive hierarchies and turned
Sadia's 19 subsidiaries, scattered throughout Brazil, into four business
units representing the company's main areas of meat, processed products,
cereals and international operations.
Like many Brazilian family companies, until recently Sadia's senior
management positions were staffed mostly by relatives of the founder. But
today only 10 per cent of the 40-50 senior manages are shareholders and only
one of the four business units is headed by a family member. 'When we
introduced the changes it was decided that in the interests of performance
the shareholders should no longer be entitled to employment,' says Furlan, a
graduate of the Insead business school.
He gives the example of Sadia's new finance director, a Stanford-educated
executive brought in from Brazil's pulp company Suzano. The appointment,
though not the first finance director from outside the family, was approved
unanimously by the council, says Furlan.
According to Paulo Vanka, a partner at consultants Price Waterhouse in Sao
Paulo, appointing a financial director from outside the family is often the
hardest decision for companies: 'With Brazil's extremely high inflation,
financial director has traditionally been perhaps the most important post'.
However, the Fontana family maintains control of the top two positions, with
Furlan as chairman and his cousin Walter Fontana as chief executive of the
new management structure, which was introduced in April after a report by
McKinsey consultants.
The management changes were brought in to speed up decisions and increase
efficiency. Previously, the semi-autonomous subsidiaries had created layers
of bureaucracy that slowed decision making and the company hopes that their
fusion into four business units, as well as the abolition of the seven
vice-presidential positions, will create a leaner and more
operationally-efficient company ready to expand.
Sadia's strategy of reforming the shareholder structure, introducing clear
rules for the separation of shareholder and management responsibilities and
keeping family members in the chairman and chief executive positions is a
model that has been adopted by other companies. Some firms, however, have
made the mistake of introducing radical management changes without first
establishing the responsibilities and duties of family shareholders and
management.
Renato Bernhoeft describes a company controlled by three families in the
state of Sao Paulo that, faced with falling profits, brought in an executive
from a multinational as president. 'The guy resigned after three months
because the families kept interfering and there was no structure designating
responsibilities,' says Bernhoeft.
Furlan notes that Sadia never considered removing the family entirely from
the company's management. 'We are proud to be a family company. Relatives,
if they are competent, can be a motor and not a millstone,' he declares.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Canteen cabinet plumps for BAe: Chris Tighe reports on which
of the rival suitors the workers at VSEL would prefer to win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the autumn fog lifted over Barrow-in-Furness yesterday and the sun broke
through, VSEL workers downing stew and chips considered the merits of the
potential rival suitors for their employer.
BAe, the canteen consensus went, offers greatly increased chances of winning
much needed new orders and the prospect of a re-entry for Vickers - as its
employees still know it - to export markets.
Such a takeover, said welding inspector Mr Terry Barker, would strengthen
VSEL's chance of winning prime-contractor status for the Pounds 2.5bn
contract for the next generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines.
He said: 'You have more clout with two or three companies going in together
and you have more MPs behind you.'
However, the prospect of a GEC takeover is viewed with some alarm by the
workforce and their union leaders.
Mr Mike Hubbold, chairman of VSEL's joint manual unions, representing 2,800
of its 6,000 employees, said: 'I would hate to be landed with GEC. GEC has
never been a company which has made anybody comfortable.'
Mr Hubbold and his fellow trade unionists met Mr Noel Davies, VSEL chief
executive, yesterday and made plain their hostility to GEC. 'We have told
VSEL management as far as we are concerned we just don't want GEC.'
Mr Hubbold is favourably inclined to a BAe takeover. VSEL, he believes,
cannot remain on its own. The workers in the canteen are the survivors, so
far, of one of Britain's most dramatic redundancy programmes. Since 1990
VSEL's workforce has been cut from more than 14,000 to barely 6,000.
The company this week told employees that numbers will fall to below 4,000 -
1,000 fewer than previous estimates - for two years once the Trident nuclear
submarine building programme ends in 1998. Even that figure depends on
winning contracts the company does not yet have.
The scale of redundancies in what was an archetypal company town has
undermined potential workforce enthusiasm for the company remaining on its
own rather than being taken over.
VSEL is no longer seen as a paternalistic employer offering job security.
Quality engineer Mr Dave Henry said: 'Two years ago I would have said these
are people from our town who have our interest to heart but after 9,000
redundancies it makes you wonder.'
Barrow, a parochial town. VSEL management has itself reduced the feeling
that it is part of the town's fabric by putting outsiders on the board.
'It's not the company it used to be.'
Last year VSEL's management sank Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, by
undercutting it by Pounds 70m for a helicopter carrier order.
In spite of this move, bitterly attacked by Swan Hunter employees as a
tactic to put them out of the market and give VSEL a monopoly of large
shipbuilding, some VSEL employees complain that their management has failed
to bring in orders since it took over in 1986.
Mr Henry said: 'The general feeling is, what have they done for us? What
have they won for us?' And VSEL concedes that its attempts to diversify into
non-defence markets since 1990 have been less effective than anticipated.
But VSEL is still by far Barrow's biggest employer, putting more than Pounds
1m a week into the local economy in wages alone, although its dominance is
much reduced and many local businesses have felt the effect.
Miss Helen Greenhalf, an assistant at Burrow's, an ironmongery and tool
sales business which has been in Barrow for 90 years, said: 'You used not to
be able to move for people in overalls down here. Now you only see one or
two.'
Since 1991 the Barrow area's male unemployment rate has risen from 4 per
cent to 13.4 per cent. Furness Enterprise, the local regeneration body, has
been spearheading attempts to diversify Barrow's economy. It estimates it
has secured 1,138 new jobs in the past two years.
The town now also has grant-attracting Intermediate Area development status
and European aid. Mr Tom Campbell, acting borough chief executive, said: 'We
see this as being the start of the renaissance period in Barrow.'
In the canteen the mood is more sanguine. Mr Paul Williamson, project
engineer, said a workmate had rechristened VSEL 'BAe Submersible'. He said:
'Do I prefer BAe or GEC? The one that pays most redundancy money.'
Ultimately, said slinger Mr Mike Conroy, not even a big conglomerate like
BAe held the cards. 'If the government gives you work you'll survive. If
they don't, you won't'

FT  14 OCT 94 / MoD extracts pledge on VSEL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has had to promise the Ministry of Defence that it will
not close VSEL's Barrow shipbuilding facility in Cumbria if its takeover bid
for the yard is successful, although further redundancies at the yard seem
inevitable.
The MoD has said that BAe cannot close Barrow without its express consent as
part of the agreement to let its bid go ahead.
The Barrow yard is the last in the UK which can build big warships such as
aircraft carriers and assault ships now that the Swan Hunter yard on the
Tyne seems doomed. The MoD and the Royal Navy are insisting that BAe must
keep the yard open for national security reasons.
However, VSEL, the yard's current owner, has already planned further job
cuts at the yard as work on four Trident nuclear missile submarines winds
down in 1996-97. Work on the next batch of Trafalgar class nuclear
hunter-killer submarines is unlikely to start before 1998.
BAe is likely to continue with VSEL's redundancy plan, but because there is
relatively little overlap between BAe's and VSEL's businesses few additional
redundancies are likely to result if BAe acquires the yard. It is not clear
whether further redundancies would be involved were GEC, the other potential
bidder, to buy the yard.
Both BAe and GEC are likely to argue that bringing the Barrow yard within a
larger group is likely to strengthen its chances of winning further work in
future years and therefore offers better long-term job prospects than if
VSEL remains independent.
VSEL had been interested in acquiring Devonport dockyard, which refits
nuclear submarines, and BAe may also be interested.
Devonport is operated by a management consortium, DML, and it had thought
that VSEL might join the consortium to bid for the privatisation of the
dockyard.
There are strong overlaps between the refitting of nuclear submarines and
their original construction. BAe might replace VSEL as a potential member of
the consortium to bid for the Devonport privatisation if its attempt to
takeover VSEL is successful. Engineers and designers might then work both on
Barrow and Devonport dockyards, cutting the total number needed.
Initial bids for Devonport have to be logged with the MoD by the end of this
month, with final bids submitted next April. GEC is thought to be less
interested in Devonport, and may not join the consortium even if it does
decide to bid for VSEL. But there may be some rationalisation between the
Yarrow and Barrow yards if GEC wins control of VSEL, which could involve
further job losses.

East Anglia, the east Midlands, the south-east and Wales are the regions
likely to enjoy the strongest growth next year, according to the Regional
Economic Outlook produced by Oxford Economic Forecasting.
The outlook says that economic growth has been fairly widespread following a
recession which had the greatest impact on the south-east. It expects the
south-east to grow slightly faster than the national average, although
Greater London is expected to show below-average growth.
According to the outlook the slowest-growing region this year will be the
north of England, where unemployment has been slow to fall.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Alarm at prospect of petrol price rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Industry and motoring groups last night expressed alarm at the prospect of
of a 31p rise in the cost of a gallon of petrol which could result follow
stringent anti-car measures in a Royal Commission report later this month.
The Road Haulage Association said a near-Pounds 3 gallon of petrol, arising
from the recommendations and tax rises already promised for the next Budget,
would have a disastrous effect on industry and the economy.
The RAC said that a rise would be futile because it would not help to push
people on to public transport.
An AA survey published yesterday showed that 55 per cent of motorists said
they would be unlikely to support a party that doubled the prices of petrol
over the next 10 years.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Straw calls for end to Clause 4
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary and a close ally of Labour
leader Mr Tony Blair, last night criticised Clause 4 of the party's
constitution as a 'sop to middle-class activists' which should be replaced
by a clear set of principles, Roland Rudd writes.
Mr Straw condemned the clause as a 'creature of its time which has long
since lost its meaning'.
He said: 'The truth is that despite Clause 4, or maybe even because of it,
Labour has throughout much of its history been a resolutely unideological
party. It is as if Clause 4 was a sop to keep middle-class party activists
happy rather than a guiding philosophy for the party.'
Mr Straw said there was little evidence that Labour in government ever
sought to take 'the means of production into public ownership' as outlined
by the clause.
Instead Labour governments pursued a more pragmatic policy and never tried
to nationalise private businesses other than public utilities, public
services and ailing companies.
It had been a convenient tool for pragmatists, he said. 'They could use it
to reassure activists that Labour was an avowedly socialist party in the
full knowledge that no one expected them to implement it. Clause 4 is a
deliberately vague and ambiguous aspiration.'
This was why the debate on Labour's aims and values was so important, he
said, since nothing short of a renewed statement of democratic socialism in
the place of Clause 4 would enthuse voters with Labour's visions of 'New
Britain'.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Meacher presses Tories on Saudi arms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DALLAS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party yesterday stepped up its pressure on the government over
the controversial Al Yamamah defence sales package with Saudi Arabia by
calling for a parliamentary inquiry into a series of big UK arms deals
conducted in the 1980s.
In a letter to Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts
Committee, Mr Michael Meacher, shadow minister for public service and open
government, says that commissions claimed to have been paid in connection
with Al Yamamah - including Pounds 12m allegedly to Mr Mark Thatcher, son of
former prime minister Baroness Thatcher - 'were not unique events, but
rather part of a general pattern which applied to other deals as well'.
Enclosed with the letter is a copy of a US court document claiming that
British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce had 'moved' about Dollars 4bn to an
unnamed Saudi in order to influence a defence contract decision.
The document refers to Saudi concerns 'about the credibility factor for the
kingdom and the alleged pay-offs'. It also refers to Lady Thatcher's son.
The allegations are made in the text of a confidential memorandum by an
employee of the US defence group United Technologies following a visit to
the Saudi capital in April 1989.
The memorandum, based on a conversation with US intelligence sources, was
used as evidence during a court case against the company brought by Mr
Thomas Dooley, a retired US army lieutenant colonel, three years ago.
Mr Dooley, who also worked for United Technologies, sued his employers after
claiming that his career as an arms salesman was destroyed after he raised
questions about alleged bribes.
Lady Thatcher has once again denied any impropriety in the Pounds 20bn Al
Yamamah contract which she helped to win while prime minister.
Speaking on Wednesday night at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas,
Texas, Lady Thatcher rejected a suggestion that her son had profited from
the arms deal.
'I'm quite satisfied that the contract was properly negotiated,' she said,
as many in the audience booed to show their support for Lady Thatcher.
Earlier in the day Lady Thatcher had visited her son's Dallas home although
it is not clear whether he was there to meet her.
An aide to Lady Thatcher rejected suggestions that her health had been
affected by the allegations about her son.

The south-east lost one in 10 of its jobs in business and financial services
during the recession, according to a report from the region's local
authorities.
The report says that the recession has ended the traditional north-south
divide, and the south-east will not lead the country out of the downturn.
Essex, Bedford and west Sussex have the poorest growth, while
Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Berkshire are expected to grow fastest.
Women in the workforce are becoming polarised between a minority in
full-time professional and managerial jobs and a majority in low-skilled,
often part-time, manual or service occupations. A decline in clerical
employment has removed a key stepping stone between the two.
During the recession employment of those aged 16 to 25 in the south-east
dropped 29 per cent for men and 23 per cent for women, while unemployment in
this age group grew by 95 per cent for men and 28 per cent for women.

FT  14 OCT 94 / MPs warn on repeated defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs gave a cautious welcome yesterday to government cost-cutting plans aimed
at saving Pounds 750m a year - but warned it should not become a regular
exercise.
The Commons defence committee also expressed fears for the future of Rosyth
naval base and concern about cuts in service hospitals and depots.
The cuts were detailed in the government's Defence Costs Study and
associated white paper Front Line First, which set out radical cuts in the
defence establishment.
The MPs said: 'As a one-off exercise the Defence Costs Study has
unquestionably been of some value in identifying savings, but the temptation
to treat it as the beginning of an annual round. . . must be firmly
resisted.'
Rosyth will be reduced to a naval support establishment, but the MPs fear
that remaining posts would depend on the dockyard, itself under threat.
The committee's report said: 'The long-term future of Rosyth as a naval
support establishment may, we regret, be no more secure than was its brief
period as a minor war vessel operating base, and is dependent on longer-term
developments at the dockyard.'
MPs also expressed concern about plans to close two service hospitals.
Amalgamating the Parachute Regiment and Marines into one joint rapid
deployment force was welcomed. But the MPs concluded: 'We look forward to
the time when sufficient funds are available to rebuild our defence forces
to the level required for our national security.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Lenders weigh up housing benefits: Private investors are
alarmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors which have furnished Pounds 5.5bn to housing associations
since 1989 to provide homes for the poor and disadvantaged have become
increasingly alarmed about their dependence on the escalating housing
benefits budget.
Ministers have identified housing benefit as a prime target as they seek to
contain public spending.
Commercial lenders say a move to cap or reduce payments would jeopardise
returns and undermine future housing investment plans.
Rent rebates and allowances are estimated to have increased to Pounds 8.65bn
in the 12 months to the end of March, a rise of 130 per cent since 1988-89.
Housing accounts for more than 10 per cent of all benefit payments compared
with 8 per cent five years ago.
Mr Douglas Smallwood, controller for policy and marketing for Halifax
building society's commercial lending division, said last week that
investors would no longer see associations as low-risk investments if their
involvement meant rents were to rise much higher.
Mr Mike Lazenby, head of housing at Nationwide building society, said:
'There is a clear political risk that ministers may intervene if rents and
benefits continue to increase sharply.'
The message from this week's Tory party conference in Bournemouth is that
payments may not be cut in the present spending round but the issue is
unlikely to go away.
At the heart of the dilemma is the increased proportion of private-finance
associations are required to raise, under the 1988 Housing Act, to pay for
new developments.
Rents have risen sharply to generate sufficient returns to attract private
investors, which from next April will be expected to provide 42 per cent of
associations' finance, compared with 25 per cent private investment in
1989-90.
According to the National Federation of Housing Associations, average weekly
housing association rents for new developments between 1988 and 1993 rose
from Pounds 29.18 to Pounds 52.45, an increase of 80 per cent.
It said that the proportion of new tenants eligible for housing benefit
since 1989-90 had increased from 67 per cent to 83 per cent. More worrying
for the government is that 49 per cent of tenants with jobs are now eligible
for benefit compared with 27 per cent five years ago.
Large numbers of tenants are caught in a poverty trap which means almost all
additional income is lost through a corresponding drop in benefit providing
little incentive for extra employment.
Commercial lenders have argued strongly that the government should not
increase the private-sector contribution to 42 per cent next April from its
present 38 per cent.
The Council for Mortgage Lenders warned in a letter to Mr David Curry,
housing minister, that further reductions in public-sector grants to housing
associations would mean 'a consequent increase in the level of exposure and
risk faced by lenders'.
Nationwide, which has lent associations almost Pounds 1bn in the past five
years, says it is likely to become more selective in its choice of
investment.
Mr Lazenby said the society would 'prefer an established association which
has been around for a number of years and has older properties which
currently generate a surplus from rental income which can be used to
cross-subsidise new rents and prevent them from rising too high'.
The outcome is that some associations, those not fitting the Nationwide
description, are likely find it more difficult to attract private investors
in future when the government is seeking to reduce the level of grants it
provides.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Warning on maritime services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems of the Lloyd's insurance market and any tax changes which made
London less attractive to its big Greek shipowning community could damage
Britain's dominance of maritime services, a study warned yesterday.
The report, commissioned by the Corporation of London, says that London's
shipping services sector has survived the decline of the British merchant
fleet but it must remain alert to possible threats.
The researchers looked at the three biggest maritime sectors - marine
insurance, ship broking and ship finance. These produce combined profits,
before labour costs, of Pounds 1bn a year. Insurance premiums written in
London are Pounds 3bn, shipbroking commissions are worth Pounds 400m a year
and the shipping loan portfolios of London-based banks are worth about
Pounds 7.5bn.
The study was carried out as part of a review of the City of London's
competitiveness in its main areas of activity. A summary of the 26 sectors
covered will be published early next year.
The study says London's shipping markets have maintained their position in
competition with other centres because of their financial liquidity and the
expertise of the people involved. The combination of services available in
London means deals can be concluded in one centre.
In marine insurance the size of the market means risks can be priced
competitively and a good service can be offered in terms of claims handling
and the diversity of risks accepted. But the recent poor financial
performance of the sector and competition from continental European
reinsurers could threaten London's position.
Insurers must cultivate stronger links with other parts of the shipping
industry and develop databases and market intelligence to avoid underpricing
risks, the report says.
The shipbroking sector depends on the presence of a high number of foreign
shipowners, principally Greeks, and its position could be damaged if tax or
other changes persuade them to leave. Piraeus in Greece has developed as a
shipping centre.
London has a strong pull on international banks offering shipping finance
but a shift away from loans to equity finance and bond offerings could
weaken its role. The US market is attractive for bond offerings while the
Oslo stockmarket is increasing its share of equity listings but many equity
offerings are still managed by UK merchant banks.

FT  14 OCT 94 / TV food ad rules tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Television advertisements will be banned from showing excessive consumption
of any food under rules being drawn up by the Independent Television
Commission, the TV watchdog.
The ITC said yesterday, however, that it had rejected calls from dentists
and food campaigners to ban fatty and sugary food advertisements from all
children's television. The ITC said it would review its policy after further
research.
The new rules on excessive consumption, designed to reinforce government
advice on healthy eating, would not stop an advertisement showing someone
enjoying a chocolate bar, said the ITC. The rules would, however, 'preclude
someone going on to open a second or a third, or pigging a whole box of
chocolates at one sitting', it said.
References to supermarket multipacks would be permitted but, the ITC said,
'filling a supermarket trolley with very large quantities of confectionery
would not'.
It is likely that an advertisement for Dime chocolate, which featured
comedian Harry Enfield loading his trolley with the bars, would fall foul of
the new rules if it were shown in future.
The ITC's proposals to revise its advertising code, which are subject to
consultation over the coming month, also outlaw 'the disparagement of good
nutritional practice'. Advertisers would be able to claim that a sweetened
fruit juice tasted delicious but not to say it was preferable to fresh fruit
or unsweetened fruit juice.
It is also likely that, under the new code, advertising slimming products to
children and adolescents will be banned.
The National Food Alliance, an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations,
said it was pleased the ITC had decided to address the issue of food
advertising but disappointed that the proposals did not go far enough. The
group said research showed children were not getting a balanced message
about nutrition from advertisements.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Steel areas win Pounds 36m EU recovery funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union is to give Pounds 36m to a number of UK regions whose
economies have been badly hit by steel industry job cuts in the past few
years. The money comes as part of the EU's Resider II programme, which aims
to help areas recover from industrial decline.
The funding is a victory for SteelAction, a coalition of 31 local
authorities with steel plants in their areas, which has been involved in
talks with the European Commission and the Department of Trade and Industry
for some months.
Mr Roger Stone, who chairs SteelAction, said yesterday: 'We welcome this
vital funding from Europe, which will give hope to communities that have
lost so many steel jobs with the run-down of the industry.'
Wales will receive Pounds 10.3m. Scotland (Lanarkshire) Pounds 8.1m, the
north-east (Teesside) Pounds 5.2m and Yorkshire and Humberside (South
Yorkshire and Scunthorpe) Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Stone said the money was a great deal more than the 'paltry' Pounds 4m
received by the UK from the first Resider programme in the late 1980s. 'We
worked hard, as a coalition of local authorities, to achieve this result,'
he said.
At a meeting in Sheffield yesterday SteelAction launched a plan to establish
a forum of local authorities in steel areas throughout the EU. Mr Chris
Mallender, SteelAction co-ordinator, said: 'We believe it's about time all
the steel communities came together to become the voice of steel in Europe.'
SteelAction comprises 16 councils in England, 13 in Wales and two in
Scotland, and has been a vociferous campaigner on European steel industry
issues.
In March it lobbied parliament and called on the government to 'meet fire
with fire' in the fight to save the British steel industry. The group has
strongly criticised what it sees as illegal subsidies for steel companies in
Italy, Spain and Germany, and the unfair competition this represents for
British producers.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Receivers sell Swans' shipyards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Receivers running Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership,
yesterday announced a series of sell-offs which will lead to the break-up of
the company.
Contracts have been exchanged for the sale of the company's Neptune Yard to
A &amp; P Appledore - which already has a shiprepair yard on the Tyne - and for
the Hebburn Dry Dock, on the south side of the Tyne, to the Wear Dockyard
Group, a Sunderland-based company also involved in shiprepair.
The sale follows the announcement that the last consortium which expressed
an interest in taking over the business had pulled out of talks.
The group, led by Manchester-based consulting engineers Organisation,
Management and Survey, said it had no option after an ultimatum from
receivers Price Waterhouse.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, for the receivers, told a news conference yesterday
that as a result of discussions with the buyers there was an indication of
'several hundred' new jobs being created at the yards.
The sales leave just the Wallsend Yard open to tenders, where the final work
is being carried out on the frigate HMS Richmond, which is due to be handed
over to the Royal Navy next month.
Swan Hunter employed more than 2,000 when it went into receivership 17
months ago. About 400 remain, of whom 130 are due to finish in a fortnight
and most of the rest over the following two weeks.
Mr Horsfield added that one of the receivers' next steps would be to invite
tenders to take over the Wallsend Yard in which there had been 'a number of
expressions of interest'.
He could not state how much the Neptune Yard and Hebburn Drydock were being
sold for but believed the total was greater than the parts of the OMS-led
consortium bid for the whole company.
Mr Horsfield rejected criticisms levelled at the receivers by the OMS-led
consortium when it withdrew from negotiations.
Referring to an MP's demand that OMS should 'put up or shut up', Mr
Horsfield said: 'They didn't put up and they certainly didn't shut up.'
Commenting on the OMS accusations that the receivers had placed a gun to the
consortium's head, he said it was more a case of calling their bluff. The
offer the consortium was making was 'a long way away from being completed'.
Mr Horsfield said that after OMS was told its original offer of Pounds 6.8m
was unacceptable, it increased it to Pounds 8.5m which might have been
acceptable.
However, OMS indicated it did not necessarily regard itself as bound by
Pounds 8.5m and that 'it might be subject to downward revision'. OMS had
said it wanted to take over the yard to fulfil an order from a US
corporation for diving support vessels and from Olympic Seas Maritime for
two catamaran ferries for use on the Athens-Brindisi route.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Lobbyists attack environment agency plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government produced plans for its long-promised environment agency
yesterday, only to have them roundly attacked by the environmental lobby as
ineffective.
The new agency, intended to be the main regulator of the environment, will
be created by a bill which will be presented to parliament as soon as
possible with a view to having it up and running by April 1996.
The agency, unveiled at the Conservative party conference by Mr John Gummer,
the environment secretary, will combine the functions of the pollution
inspectorate, the National Rivers Authority and the local waste regulation
authorities. But it will not contain the drinking water inspectorate or any
of the specialised agencies which regulate the nuclear industry.
The agency's brief, contained in a six-clause 'management statement', will
be to provide effective environmental protection, but without imposing an
excessive burden on industry. The bill requires the agency to 'take into
account the costs which are likely to be incurred, and the benefits which
are likely to accrue' from its actions.
Although the agency will be established as an independent entity, the bill
says that ministers shall 'from time to time', give it 'guidance' and the
agency must pay attention.
Mr Gummer said the agency itself will have to be fit and lean. The combined
staffs of the agencies it will incorporate amount to about 9,000 people, but
the Department of the Environment expects it to end up employing fewer than
that.
The plans were welcomed by environmental regulators as a way of
strengthening an integrated approach to pollution control, although the
rivers authority has said that it is worried that the agency's regions will
be based on political boundaries rather than catchment areas.
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, denounced the plan as 'a
cost-cutting exercise which will lead to weaker, not stronger protection of
the environment.'
Environmental groups were also quick to attack what they saw as government
failure to deliver its promised strong environmental regulator. Mr Andrew
Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, said: 'The new agency will
have no overriding legal duty to protect and enhance the environment. It
will not live up to its name.'
Several critics said the new bill would weaken the powers contained in
existing environmental legislation.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England was concerned about the high
priority given to economic interests in the management statement. 'By having
to assess the cost implications of everything it does, the agency may be
unable to champion effectively the environment cause.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Recycling scheme backed by environment secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Retail stores and other companies were warned yesterday that opting out of a
scheme for recycling packaging would not secure them any commercial
advantage, Ivor Owen writes.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, told the Conservative conference that
legislation would underpin arrangements agreed by the packaging and retail
industries. When Mr Gummer and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, accepted the need for legislation they insisted that its main
purpose should be to facilitate the role of market forces. He praised the
packaging and retailing industries for a scheme which was expected to
increase to nearly 60 per cent - double the existing level - the amount of
material recycled.
Mr Gummer said legislation to establish the environment agency, published in
draft form yesterday, provided for a leaner regulatory body. It would bring
together the pollution inspectorate, the National Rivers Authority and the
waste regulators, and end overlapping jurisdiction, competing regulations
and unnecessary repetitive inspections.
Mr Gummer said improved protection for the 'green belt' around large cities
and towns would be 'balanced'. The environment would be enhanced if existing
buildings on sites in green belts were improved instead of being left to
decline and decay.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Lottery rapped on fundraising efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading fundraiser has attacked the National Lottery as one of the least
cost-efficient ways of raising money for good causes ever devised.
The attack came from Mr Henry Drucker, former director of Campaign for
Oxford, which raised Pounds 341m in the biggest philanthropic campaign ever
undertaken by a British institution.
Mr Drucker, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, told the
Royal Society of Arts that after prizes, taxes, costs and promoters'
profits, just 25 per cent would go to the good causes.
A survey for the National Council of Voluntary Organisations in 1992
suggested that there could be an annual loss of donations of Pounds 428m to
the lottery. Religious, educational and medical charities had been excluded
in favour of the five nominated beneficiaries - the arts, charities, a
millennium fund, national heritage and sport.
The National Lottery also represented a centralising of power, he added.
Mr Drucker said: 'One donor (the state through its instruments) will decide
the allocation of a much-increased proportion of the charities' support.'
ICL, a member of the Camelot consortium that will launch the National
Lottery on November 19, said it was on schedule to install about 10,000
terminals and train 37,000 retail staff for Monday November 14, when tickets
go on sale.

FT  14 OCT 94 / BNFL offer on nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disposal of the UK's radioactive waste should be the responsibility of a
single government organisation, says British Nuclear Fuels, the nuclear fuel
reprocessing company.
BNFL, in its submission to the government's review of radioactive waste
policy, says this would be the most cost-effective way of dealing with the
problem and offers itself for the part.
It says: 'BNFL believes that we can, and should, play a major role in this
area provided that it does not require us to accept risks which are
incompatible with our commercial status.'
BNFL supports the main proposals in the consultation document put out by the
government in August, which favoured placing most of the UK's more
radioactive waste underground. The company says, however, that it has the
capacity to hold waste above ground for some years if deep disposal plans
are put back.
BNFL appeals to the government to pay attention to the costs of waste
regulation so that its international competitiveness is not impaired.
In another submission to the review the UK Atomic Energy Authority puts
itself forward to manage the decommissioning of nuclear installations.
Mr Derek Pooley, the chief executive, said this proposal would ensure
decommissioning would be 'properly planned and co-ordinated over a long
period'.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Lawyer brands Magnet a 'shambles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Magnet, the fitted-kitchen retailer whose 1989 management buy-out proved a
spectacular disaster in which backers lost almost Pounds 600m, was a
'shambolic' business, not the well-run company investors believed, the High
Court was told yesterday.
The claim was made by lawyers opening the case for GE Capital, which lost
about Pounds 70m from investing in the buy-out.
GE Capital is claiming the damages from Bankers Trust, the lead bank in the
transaction. Bankers Trust, which opened its case last week, is in turn
suing Arthur Andersen, adviser to the Magnet management, for Pounds 600m.
The actions between investors, bankers and professional advisers - expected
to last up to a year - raise questions about the nature of diligence and the
extent of the duty of care advisers should have during acquisitions.
The buy-out cost Pounds 629m, with Bankers Trust leading the banking
syndicate which financed it. Lower-than-expected profits, the recession and
rising interest rates hit the highly borrowed company. When sold earlier
this year, it fetched just Pounds 56m.
Mr Anthony Boswood QC, for GE Capital, said yesterday that all involved in
the Magnet buy-out could now see that 'serious misjudgments' were made about
the commercial merits of the transaction. However, GE Capital had been given
no clue of this - true figures about the company's financial standing were
either hidden by those who knew or were not discovered by those responsible
for finding out, he said.
The management had saddled itself with unmanageable levels of debt and
produced profit figures that did not add up. Bankers Trust had 'completely
failed' to discharge its responsibilities - ignoring warnings about Magnet's
financial health. Arthur Andersen was negligent and unprofessional in
failing to produce an objective report on Magnet to Bankers Trust, he said.
Bankers Trust has also argued that Arthur Andersen was negligent for failing
to provide it with such an objective and independent report on Magnet.
The claims are denied by the accounting firm, which has previously insisted
that its duty was entirely to the Magnet management and that to have acted
for Bankers Trust would have amounted to a conflict of interest.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Milestone on the long road to a
lasting settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement yesterday of an open-ended loyalist ceasefire was, as Mr
John Major said, 'unalloyed good news'.
It was widely recognised that the immensely difficult task of forging a
durable political settlement in Northern Ireland would be almost impossible
unless talks could take place in an atmosphere of peace.
Now another big part of the jigsaw has fallen into place. In the words of Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister: 'What is most significant now is we
are going to be having negotiations without the fear of violence in the
background.'
But it would almost certainly be a mistake to anticipate that progress
towards agreement on Ulster's future will be anything other than slow and
fitful in view of the gulf still separating some of the main protagonists.
Many unionists remain convinced that reform can be limited to setting up a
devolved assembly with narrowly defined powers. That is a million miles from
Sinn Fein's perception of the eventual outcome. As one participant said
yesterday: 'Somebody is being deceived in this process.'
In view of the caution underlying London's welcome of yesterday's
announcement, what looks set to happen next is a relatively brief period of
stocktaking.
The loyalists' assertion that the 'permanence of our ceasefire will be
completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all
nationalist/republican violence' will be used to increase the pressure on
republican leaders to make clear that their ceasefire is for good.
Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, says the loyalists'
decision to emphasise that they will not return to arms unless republicans
do likewise means that 'another of the IRA's fig-leaves has been shed'. Mr
Mates believes that no unionist 'of any shade' would be prepared to sit down
with republican leaders until the question of permanence is resolved.
Unionists are also expected to be quick to emphasise that armed republican
splinter groups such as the INLA have yet to say that they have laid down
their arms.
But there are strong signs that the government may shortly adjust its stance
on the six-week-old IRA ceasefire in recognition of the fact that it may
never be given a pledge that it is permanent.
The idea that London should open a 'reversible' dialogue with the IRA's
political wing will be considered by Mr Major and cabinet colleagues next
week.
A staged response - perhaps lifting the exclusion orders on prominent Sinn
Fein members first then reopening indirect contacts - would allow the
government to be seen to be responding positively while maintaining the
option of withdrawing contacts.
Until now, the government's position has been that it would start a
preliminary dialogue with republican leaders within three months of a
permanent end to IRA violence. Public confirmation of any adjustment in the
government's position could come in a Commons debate pencilled in for
October 26.
There is also thought to be a strong likelihood of a summit meeting soon
between Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister Mr
Reynolds is keen for Sinn Fein to be brought into the political process as
soon as possible via his proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. There
have recently been signs that this may be delayed until early next month.
Once preliminary dialogue starts - which ministers have acknowledged could
be under way by Christmas - the focus will quickly move to the question of
the paramilitaries' willingness to hand in their weapons. Once again, few
believe that these negotiations would be anything other than long-drawn-out
and complex. One potential complication about the IRA's weapons arsenals is
that a significant proportion of their arms is thought to be stored in the
Irish Republic.
Moderate unionists would not insist on the surrender of every gun, but they
will almost certainly be extremely reluctant to allow Sinn Fein into the
full-fledged political talks process until all heavy weapons had been handed
in.
Another important detail will be whether representatives of the loyalist
paramilitaries will be admitted to these talks and, if so, how they are to
be represented - bearing in mind that loyalist terror groups are banned.
Commenting on this yesterday, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary, said: 'They are very, very anxious that their own political
anxieties, their political concerns, should be heeded, should be expressed.
Therefore, once we are satisfied that this is for real, we shall want to be
considering with them and with other people ways by which it should be
possible for their anxieties to be met.'
As for the political talks themselves, expectations of when London and
Dublin's much-delayed framework document will be published now vary from
early next month to not until next year.
This should provide a clearer view of what London and Dublin see as the
options for developing north-south relations. It should also provide a clear
insight into the vital question of whether Dublin is prepared to amend the
articles of its constitution enshrining its territorial claim over the
province, in return for a commitment by London to amend the 1920 Government
of Ireland Act.
Bilateral discussions involving the province's constitutional parties on the
shape of Ulster's future government are also carrying on, amid signs that
Rev Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party is considering ending
its boycott.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Mayhew reaffirms faith in union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party's belief in the union was emphatically reasserted
yesterday by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, as he
welcomed the loyalist ceasefire as 'another significant move forward in the
long road to a lasting peace.'
In a debate at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth coinciding with
yesterday's ceasefire announcement Mr Mayhew made a forthright defence of
the province's right to self-determination.
But, watched by prime minister Mr John Major, he stopped just short of
embracing grassroots calls for the government actively to persuade Ulster's
people that their best future lies in the United Kingdom.
Sir Patrick said: 'One undoubted fact in Northern Ireland is that most
people living there want to stay within the union. That is where they think
their best interests lie. And I say without hesitation we are glad of it.
'We are persuaders for the future of Northern Ireland to be decided among
the people of Northern Ireland, themselves, freely and without external
impediment,' he said.
The 'delicacy of balance' had to be maintained if 'this province of the
United Kingdom' was to achieve a less antagonistic way of life.
Welcoming the loyalist ceasefire, Sir Patrick said the government would test
that the 'intention of permanence' was genuine 'as we have tested the intent
and sincerity of the IRA'.
He added: 'If we can confirm to our satisfaction that the intention is
permanent then we will explore with them the ways that the peace process can
be strengthened and their views taken into account.'
He made clear that the government was still not quite satisfied that the IRA
had ended its campaign of violence for good. What mattered, he said, was the
need to be sure they would not revert to violence rather than 'the precise
language in which their intention is expressed'.
Sir Patrick honoured the fortitude of the people of Northern Ireland in the
face of terrorism, republican and loyalist. He condemned the terrorists'
'sickening, random crimes' and said of the horrific aftermath of outrages:
'The blood congeals and lies like pools of black treacle on the floor.'
Sir Patrick and Mr Major were greeted enthusiastically by representatives in
spite of the leadership's decision not to allow a vote on an amendment
urging the government to be a persuader for the union.
Mr Leonard Fee, chairman of the Conservative Northern Ireland Area Council
and the senior unpaid Tory in the province, said 1,100 people had signed a
petition urging the amendment to be called.
He said: 'If we start down the devolution slope I believe within a fairly
short period of time our nation will be in tatters.'
Ms Dorothy Dunlop, a former Belfast city councillor, implicitly criticised
Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, by saying that the government
should have called a referendum after signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement in
1985. 'If we had had a referendum then, we would have been spared much of
the loyalist violence whose end we are celebrating today,' she said.
She believed Mr Major would not have entered into the agreement had he been
prime minister in 1985.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Business chiefs and politicians
welcome move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry in Ulster and business leaders in the
province welcomed yesterday's loyalist ceasefire announcement.
Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the CBI in the province, said: 'We have to
welcome any statement that reflects people's will to stop violence, and hope
it is permanent.'
Mr Denis Galway, senior vice-president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, said the ceasefire would contribute to business
confidence, tourist development and international investment.
Mr Frank Caddy, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade, said city
traders were looking forward to attracting more leading high street names.
The atmosphere in Belfast city centre had changed since the IRA called its
ceasefire and he expected it to get even better.
'The pace has slowed down, people are stopping and looking, not rushing in
to buy and get out,' he said.
Mr John Hume, leader of the SDLP, welcomed the announcement as 'a very good
day for the people of Northern Ireland, a day which they deserve. Let us now
put the past behind us and work together to build a future we can all be
proud of.'
Mr Jim Wilson, general secretary of the Ulster Unionist party, welcomed the
move and said it was clear that the loyalist paramilitaries had been
listening to his party leader Mr James Molyneaux when he said that there had
been no sell-out to republicans and no shift in the government attitude to
the future constitutional position of the province.
Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP, said there would have to be an
election before the fringe loyalist political parties and Sinn Fein could be
invited to political talks.
He said: 'We are dealing here with very small political parties and we are
dealing with the question of whether they do in fact have an electoral
mandate. In another way Sinn Fein have the same problem.'
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, welcomed 'the
fact that people are not going to continue murdering'. But he totally
rejected any suggestion of talks involving former paramilitaries on either
side. 'There's nobody can get to the negotiating table because they've used
a gun and murdered people,' he said.
Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, welcomed the loyalist ceasefire and
urged Mr Major to 'stop fumbling with this peace process' and to accelerate
the government's response.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Nothing perhaps better personifies the change in Northern Ireland as the
choice of Augustus 'Gusty' Spence, as yesterday's spokesman for the loyalist
paramilitaries.
The man picked to announce to the world that the para-militaries had opted
for a universal cessation of hostilities has not always been a man of peace.
Twenty-eight years ago Mr Spence formed part of a Ulster Volunteer Force
band that fired on four young Roman Catholics as they left a pub in West
Belfast, near the loyalist Shankhill Road.
One of the Catholics, 18-year-old Peter Ward, was killed. Three men,
including Mr Spence, were subsequently arrested and imprisoned for the
attack.
Many Catholics believe that murder was directly responsible for the civil
unrest and street disorder which developed later.
Mr Spence - now elderly and suffering from poor health - claims to have
undergone a Christian conversion while in prison, abandoning direct
involvement in terrorist operations. He was released from prison in 1984
after serving 16 years of a life sentence.
He has always admitted having once been a member of the UVF but denies that
he murdered Mr Ward.
He formed a youth training centre for the unemployed in the late 1980s. The
centre closed last year after getting into financial difficulties.
In a rare interview four years ago Mr Spence explained why some people in
Belfast chose to live behind walls.
He said: 'In a society of fear people stay with their own sort. We are
living in a society which has never been normal.'
In recent months he has kept in close touch with the internal debate of the
loyalist paramilitaries. Yesterday he was chosen to usher in the prospect of
at least more normal times.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Now to choose representatives for
the negotiating table - Prospects for the paramilitaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In announcing yesterday a cessation of hostilities from midnight Ulster's
loyalist hardliners were not merely responding to the challenge thrown down
by the IRA's six-week-old ceasefire.
By drawing a line under the era of violence loyalists - like the IRA in
neighbouring West Belfast - were demanding a place at the negotiating table
in any discussions on the future of the province, ahead of the expected
agreement between London and Dublin on the long-awaited framework document.
The main question remains if the loyalists are now to enter the democratic
fray, who exactly will represent them?
Mr David Irvine of the fringe Progressive Unionists (PUP) said: 'No section
of our community should be left out of the discussions for our future.' He
is said to have close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the
younger of the two paramilitary organisations represented at yesterday's
press conference.
The loyalist paramilitaries have no formal electoral backing - unlike the
IRA which through Sinn Fein, its political wing, can claim a mandate -
albeit a small one, with less than 10 per cent of votes in the province at
the last election.
Mr Irvine and the Ulster Democratic party's Mr Gary McMichael - as a Lisburn
councillor the only person on the platform to hold elective office -
projected themselves as sophisticated and well-suited politicians.
Some believe that Mr Hugh Smyth of the PUP, the mayor of Belfast - said to
be close to loyalist opinion - is keen to take a leading role. But one
mainstream unionist politician said there would have to be elections before
loyalist leaders could claim political legitimacy in the community.
The prospect is that the emergence of this new radical force will cause
further fragmentation in unionist ranks.
Behind the loyalists' decision to seek a place in the negotiations is the
sense of dissatisfaction in poorer protestant areas with the mainstream
unionist parties - Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party and the
hardline Democratic Unionist party led by the Rev Ian Paisley.
As one community leader put it: 'Gerry Adams is getting out and talking to
people. When was the last time Jim Molyneaux came down this street?'
Mr Irvine said yesterday: 'Both parties sitting at this table have proven
that they are prepared to enter the future with less baggage than the other
unionist parties.'
By Northern Ireland hardliner standards yesterday's loyalist statement was
almost a model of moderation and flexibility. In particular, it was at pains
to make clear they would have nothing against talking with Sinn Fein,
something Mr Paisley has said he will never countenance.
Mr 'Gusty' Spence, one of the founders of the UVF, said: 'Of course the day
will come when we will sit down with Sinn Fein. Everything will have to be
in place. It will have to be right for them, for us, for everyone. And yes I
think we'll do good business together.'
Many of those representing the loyalist paramilitaries on yesterday's
platform had done time in prison on terrorist-related offences, and it is
easy to imagine the experience has been both chastening and educational.
Younger men, who have taken command of the organisations in recent years,
are understood to have driven a very hard bargain before agreeing to end the
violence. But the fringe political parties which have persuaded them to
enter the democratic process are convinced the ceasefire will hold.
The murder campaigns of the two main loyalist terrorist organisations in
Northern Ireland have surpassed the IRA in recent years. For that reason the
Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and UVF regard their ceasefire decision as
having been taken from a position of strength.
The decision also points to a long-term strategy to don the clothes of
democratic politics and shelve the Armalite.
Much has been made of the role of the loyalist leadership's consultations on
Monday with loyalist prisoners in the Maze prison on the decision to call a
halt to violence.
The government's announcement, restated this week by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, that any new arrangement for the province would have to be
put to referendum, has also done much to calm fears of a sell-out of
unionist interests.
In spite of demands by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, most
observers believe the delay in responding to the IRA move had as much to do
with public relations as substantive issues.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'After a widespread consultative process initiated by representations from
the Ulster Democratic and Progressive Unionist Parties, and after having
received confirmation and guarantees in relation to Northern Ireland's
constitutional position within the United Kingdom, as well as other
assurances, and, in the belief that the democratically expressed wishes of
the greater number of people in Northern Ireland will be respected and
upheld, the CLMC (Combined Loyalist Miliary Command), will universally cease
all operational hostilities as from 12 midnight on Thursday, the 13th
October 1994.
'The permanence of our ceasefire will be completely dependent upon the
continued cessation of all nationalist/republican violence, the sole
responsibility for a return to war lies with them.
'In the genuine hope that this peace will be permanent, we take the
opportunity to pay homage to all our fighters, commandos and volunteers who
have paid the supreme sacrifice. They did not die in vain. The union is
safe.  'To our physically and mentally wounded who have served Ulster so
unselfishly, we wish a speedy recovery, and to the relatives of these men
and women, we pledge our continued moral and practical support.  'To our
prisoners who have undergone so much deprivation and degradation with great
courage and forbearance, we solemnly promise to leave no stone unturned to
secure their freedom.
'To our serving officers, NCOs and personnel, we extend our eternal
gratitude for their obedience to orders, for their ingenuity, resilience and
good humour in the most trying of circumstances, and, we commend them for
their courageous fortitude and unshakable faith over the long years of armed
confrontation.
'In all sincerity, we offer to the loved ones of all innocent victims over
the past 25 years, abject and true remorse. No words of ours will compensate
for the intolerable suffering they have undergone during the conflict.
'Let us firmly resolve to respect our differing views of freedom, culture
and aspiration and never again permit our political circumstances to
degenerate into bloody warfare.
'We are on the threshold of a new and exciting beginning with our battles in
future being political battles, fought on the side of honesty, decency and
democracy against the negativity of mistrust, misunderstanding and
malevolence, so that, together, we can bring forth a wholesome society in
which our children, and their children, will know the meaning of true
peace.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Vouchers plan for nursery
education - Major to guarantee schooling for four-year-olds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is expected to say today that his government will introduce a
voucher system for nursery education - guaranteeing schooling to every child
at the age of four.
Following strong pressure from parents, educationalists and teachers the
prime minister is due to announce in today's speech to the Conservative
conference that the parents of every four-year-old will be given a voucher
to fund a place at a nursery or at a reception class in a primary school.
The reform, which will affect 600,000 children, is expected to cost the
government well over half a billion pounds.
It is understood that in spite of the stringency of this year's public
spending round the Treasury has approved Department for Education plans to
introduce such a scheme within the next two years.
There was speculation last night, however, that there would be no provision
for three-year-old children, as has been promised by the Labour party.
The pressure to extend nursery education built up amid signs that the UK was
trailing behind France, Belgium and the Netherlands in providing schooling
to three and four-year-olds. However, the UK's provision is slightly ahead
of the US and Japan.
Britain's public-sector nurseries provide places for 38 per cent of
three-year-olds and 56 per cent of four-year-olds.
Late last year the prime minister called for nursery education to be
provided for all children, but acknowledged that there was a short-term
funding barrier.
On primary and secondary education, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education
secretary, yesterday announced tougher standards for teaching English in
England and Wales.
Mrs Shephard told Tory representatives at Bournemouth that a tougher
curriculum for English language teaching would be introduced next year, amid
widespread concern that standards of literacy have slipped sharply in recent
years.
She also launched an initiative to raise public consciousness about the need
for good communication skills, inviting leaders of business and industry to
tell the government about their experience in this area.
She said: 'I want to put together a national campaign, inviting politicians,
industry, the media and business to raise awareness about the need for clear
communication. It is very important that people in business understand the
importance of communicating clearly with the customer.'
Mrs Shephard assured representatives that the government would impose a
period of stability in primary and secondary education in the next few years
to allow its recent reforms to take root.
She made clear that the workload on teachers imposed by the national
curriculum would be sharply reduced following the implementation of a report
by Sir Ron Dearing, the chief curriculum adviser.
Announcing that she would accept Sir Ron's report in full, Mrs Shephard told
journalists that 20 per cent of the timetable for primary school teachers
would be flexible and 40 per cent for secondary schools.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Shephard signals return to
traditional English teaching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new curriculum for English announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard in her
conference speech will require teachers to take a much more traditionalist
approach in the classroom than they do now, emphasising grammar, spelling
and punctuation.
However, it is a far less radical shift from the current orthodoxy than a
proposal prepared by curriculum advisers for Mr John Patten, former
secretary of state for education, in May last year.
That proposal suggested primary school pupils should be corrected if they
failed to speak 'standard English' - either in the classroom or in the
playground.
The new curriculum does emphasise written and spoken and standard English.
But at primary school children are only expected to be corrected on their
standard English where this is appropriate. Teachers would not need to
monitor language in the playground.
The new curriculum will also continue with controversial plans to introduce
a compulsory reading list of books, from which secondary school teachers
would choose a few titles.
However, the list will only be compulsory up to the end of the 19th century.
The government is likely only to publish an advisory list for literature in
this century, as literary opinion is divided over the merits of modern
authors.
Students will still be expected to read modern works.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Government puts chips on
the menu for everyone - The smart-card technology which could be applied to
Tory plans to introduce identity cards - if the cost hurdle can be overcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The mention of identity cards is guaranteed to raise hackles in a Britain
acutely conscious of threats to civil liberties. So Shell UK's plan,
announced this month, to replace fuel tokens and trading stamps with 'smart'
cards may give government plans to introduce identity cards an unexpected
boost by making the public familiar with a technology which has so far
failed to find much favour.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was clearly referring to smart-card
technology when yesterday he talked about an identity card capable of being
a bank card, driving licence, social security card and kidney donor card.
He could, of course, have been talking about a paper document. But without
the security against fraud afforded by electronic technology it is hard to
see where the advantage in paper would lie.
Since its invention in the late 1970s the smart card - a piece of plastic
the size of a bank card with an electronic circuit embedded in it - has been
acknowledged as prime candidate for a host of applications - identity card,
security device, electronic purse and information storage.
Pioneered by the French, whose trials of the card as an electronic purse
proved the feasibility of the technology on a large scale, it has found
applications from transport systems to satellite television and public
telephones. Mastercard and Visa, the international payment groups, have said
that they intend to move to smart-card technology.
There are about 300m smart cards in circulation, and the number is expected
to increase to 3bn within the decade. Last year, according to Retail Banking
Research, about 14bn transactions were made with cards capable of being
'charged' with cash in advance.
The advantage smart cards have over conventional bank cards is the ability
to store and process large amounts of information while remaining completely
secure. The magnetic stripes on conventional cards are easy to obtain and
data can be written on the stripe using equipment not much more
sophisticated than a domestic tape recorder.
Smart cards contain memory and microprocessor chips which are hard to
counterfeit. They can store codes and carry out complex calculations which
render them tamper-proof. And they can hold, in computer language, some
physical characteristics of the card-holder - a fingerprint, for example, or
the pattern in the retina of the eye.
Together these can be used to guarantee that a card is genuine and that the
cardholder is who he or she claims to be. It can also hold extensive
information about the holder - medical history, for example, or bank
statement.
The sticking point - and one reason why banks have not already replaced
magnetic-stripe cards with electronic cheque books - is cost.
Magnetic-stripe cards cost almost nothing - about 10p each in bulk. Smart
cards are expensive.
The most common types of smart card - representing about 90 per cent of
those in issue - have little processing but extensive storage capabilities.
Mr Bernard Brooks, managing director of GPT Card Technology, which
manufactures 30m of these memory cards each year, said the cost in bulk was
about 50p.
True smart cards containing both memory and microprocessor can cost between
Pounds 5 and Pounds 20 each. They are manufactured in comparatively small
numbers by a handful of manufacturers worldwide. The terminals used to read
them vary in price from Pounds 800 for a system robust enough for street use
to Pounds 150 for a desktop box in a secure environment.
Memory cards which are adequate for use in payphones, in unscrambling
encrypted satellite video films and in storing motorists' petrol points in
Shell's scheme are not secure enough to be used as electronic wallets or
multipurpose identity cards. These applications require a true smart card
with a complete computer embedded in it.
Mondex, an electronic purse which National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank
and British Telecommunications intend to test next year, uses Japanese-made
computer chips.
Some manufacturers are looking for ways to cut the cost by combining
magnetic technology with microelectronics. Thorn EMI has developed a smart
card which does away with expensive data encryption on the chip in favour of
a development of its 'watermark' technology which makes cards hard to tamper
with.
Dr David Arnold of Thorn's Transaction Group said the cost of the chip could
be cut significantly by minimising its size.
Advanced Risc Machines, the UK-based microprocessor company owned by Acorn,
Apple of the US and VLSI, is talking to Gemplus of France, Europe's biggest
smart-card manufacturer, with a view to using low-cost, low-power processors
in smart cards.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Monks urges less hostility
to unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, told the government last night
that ending hostility towards unions could help the party retain power at
the next election.
He warned ministers that attacks on unions were no longer an automatic way
of winning votes.
He added: 'Even if that were ever the case, it certainly is not true any
more. People now look to trade unions to support them in a world of work
that is uncertain and insecure.'
Mr Monks, the first TUC chief to speak at a fringe meeting at the
Conservative party conference, said more and more workers afraid of losing
their jobs were looking to the unions for support.
However, he said, a visit by a union leader to a political party conference
would pass with little comment in any other European country. 'Only in
Britain is there such deep distrust and mutual suspicion between trade
unions and government.'
To take over Labour's lead in the opinion polls the Conservatives would
require the votes of 'many more trade unionists'.
Mr Monks said it could not be 'good politics' for the Conservatives to
continue to be seen as anti-union when an opinion poll had recorded 89 per
cent support for the view that unions were necessary to protect people's
interests at work.
The problem faced by the government was that most people recognised that the
relationship between employer and employee was 'fundamentally one-sided'.
Mr Monks said: 'The world of work is autocratic and dominated by top-down
management power, and getting more so.'
He attacked the government for excluding Britain from the social chapter of
the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Monks argued that people reluctant to accept that an economic recovery
was under way were hardly likely to believe that having fewer rights at work
than were available in other countries was a crucial ingredient for success.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives at Bournemouth: Brittan and Howe hit back
on EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of the leading pro-Europeans in the Conservative party yesterday hit
back at calls from rightwing Tories for Britain to distance itself from
Europe, arguing that this could lead to the government's defeat at the next
general election.
In another sign of the divisions over the European Union which have
resurfaced at this week's conference, Sir Leon Brittan, one of the UK's
European commissioners, and Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, angrily
denounced a recent string of attacks on Brussels by the right of the party.
They were joined last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, who reasserted his call for Britain's place to remain at the
heart of Europe.
Sir Leon, addressing a fringe meeting of the Conservative Group for Europe,
issued a thinly veiled attack on Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor,
describing his recent call for Britain to leave the EU as 'damaging and
dangerous'.
He said: 'People have been indulging in fantasy. If things go on in this
way, we are on the road to extremism and xenophobia'.
He did not refer by name to Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary,
who made a powerful attack on the EU in his conference speech this week.
However, Sir Leon warned that there were leading anti-Europeans in the party
who did not admit that they wanted the UK to leave Europe, 'but who are
acting to pull us in that direction whether they say so or not'.
In a speech to the Tory Reform Group last night Lord Howe attacked Mr
Lamont's 'complacent assertions' about Europe and mocked calls by rightwing
Tories for the adoption of a clear anti-European stance against Labour.
'Wrapping ourselves in the union jack would simply be a prelude to burial at
sea, in clear blue water, somewhere out in the mid-Atlantic,' he said.
He added that any move to reduce the UK's links with Europe would not be
accepted by the British people or by industry. 'There is no majority in
Britain for isolation or independence on those terms, however deceptively
packaged in the Europhobes' rhetoric of self-government,' he said.
Both speeches added to speculation that the party could face a serious split
in the run up to the European inter-governmental conference in 1996, which
will map out the EU's institutional structure.
However, Lord Howe also argued that the party was on the verge of a tough
internal battle over how to respond to Mr Tony Blair's recent election as
Labour leader, and that it would be dangerous to move any further to the
right.
In the first admission by a senior Tory figure of the threat posed by the
Labour leader, Lord Howe said that Mr Blair's election 'could prove the most
important political event in the last two decades'.
He added: 'Its long-range effect could rank with Margaret Thatcher's
re-definition of the centre ground in 1975-79 as one of those periodic
shifts that radically alter the terms of political debate in Britain.
'The best way of meeting and beating the Blair challenge is emphatically not
by pressing on regardless to the right,' he said. 'Establishing as much
clear blue water between ourselves and Labour is the Pavlovian response of a
party on a suicide mission.'
Mr Heseltine, in a speech to a fringe meeting, listed what he called
Britain's clear interests and objectives in the EU's development. 'We must
recognise that the European Union is here, is going to remain and has been
responsible for an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity on our
continent,' he said.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Expansion of nursery
places planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is set to introduce an extension of nursery education,
following sustained pressure on the issue from parents, educationalists and
teachers.
Mr John Major is expected to announce the provision of more nursery places
for children aged four in his keynote address to the conference today. Late
last year the prime minister called for nursery education to be provided for
all children, but acknowledged that there was a short-term funding barrier.
It is understood that in spite of the stringency of this year's public
spending round the Treasury has approved Department for Education plans to
introduce such a scheme in the next two to three years.
Yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, announced tougher
standards for teaching in primary and secondary schools in England and
Wales.
Mrs Shephard told Tory representatives at Bournemouth that a tougher
curriculum for English language teaching would be introduced next year, amid
widespread concern that standards of literacy have slipped sharply in recent
years.
She also launched an initiative to raise public consciousness about the need
for good communication skills, inviting leaders of business and industry to
tell the government about their experience in this area.
She said: 'I want to put together a national campaign, inviting politicians,
industry, the media and business to raise awareness about the need for clear
communication. It is very important that people in business understand the
importance of communicating clearly with the customer.'
Mrs Shephard assured representatives that the government would impose a
period of stability in primary and secondary education in the next few years
to allow its recent reforms to take root.
She made clear that the workload on teachers imposed by the national
curriculum would be sharply reduced following the implementation of a report
by Sir Ron Dearing.
Announcing that she would accept Sir Ron's report in full, Mrs Shephard told
journalists that 20 per cent of the timetable for primary school teachers
would be flexible and 40 per cent for secondary schools.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Portillo stresses fight
against 'pernicious' inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo yesterday underlined the government's commitment to low
inflation, arguing that stable prices helped mobilise investment and
preserve the welfare state.
The employment secretary said in a speech to the Conservative Political
Centre group that maintaining low inflation assisted the government to
mobilise private capital for infrastructure investment.
He said that with high and unpredictable rates of inflation in much of the
period since the second world war the provision of infrastructure had become
a state monopoly.
Low inflation was also essential to the government's aim of a 'modern and
affordable welfare state'. Only with low inflation would people be
encouraged to provide for their own retirement. In times of high inflation
'inevitably people look to the state to do more and provide larger pensions
to compensate for the decline in value of their own schemes and their
savings', he said.
Although Mr Portillo's speech was low key compared with some of his other
interventions at this year's conference, it nonetheless marked out his claim
 -as a former Treasury minister - to have a say in determining government
economic policy.
Mr Portillo said inflation affected the government's management of the
nation's finances. He noted that in the last Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, raised taxes by far less than the amount by which he reduced
borrowing because low inflation enabled the government to keep a tight grip
on its spending.
Mr Portillo predicted that in future 'balanced budgets will be the order of
the day, just as they were for governments in the 19th century'.
Inflation, Mr Portillo said, was 'a pernicious form of hidden tax' that
'amounts to dishonest government'. Inflation in Britain had exerted a bad
effect on industrial relations, savings, investment, resource allocation and
on management. It had reduced efficiency and productivity and thus held back
the growth of living standards.
Expectations of inflation were the 'ugly sister' of inflation. In
anticipation of inflation businesses pushed prices higher. Capital was
diverted away from investment in productive projects into less risky assets
such as gilt-edged stock. As a legacy of high inflation investors continued
to demand high nominal returns even when inflation was low.
Mr Portillo said the economies that Britain sought to emulate - notably
Japan and Germany - did not tolerate inflation. He recalled that during the
past 20 years there had been only two years when UK inflation was lower than
Germany's. These were 1992 and 1993. 'We are determined this will not be a
brief flash in the pan,' he said. The permanent defeat of inflation was 'at
the top' of the government's political agenda.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Bookies predict
nine-minute ovation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister is likely to get a nine minute standing ovation when he
addresses the conference today, according to odds issued by William Hill,
the bookmakers.
The company offered relatively short odds of 3-1 against a nine minute
ovation, compared to 4-1 for seven minutes or less, 7-2 for eight minutes,
4-1 for 10 minutes, 8-1 for 11 minutes and 7-2 for 12 minutes or more. Bets
will be settled on the time for the ovation calculated by the Press
Association news agency.
Mr Major received conference ovations lasting 9 1/2 minutes in 1991, about
seven minutes in 1992, when applause merged into singing, and 11 minutes in
1993.
His predecessor Lady Thatcher often received ovations lasting eight to 10
minutes. Her longest was more than 11 minutes in 1987.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Plea for a new Atlantic
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, yesterday called for a new
'Atlantic Community' to intensify co-operation between the nations of the
European Union and North America, Peter Norman writes.
He said the community, which 'need imply no new diminution of sovereignty
nor loss of independence' would promote common interests such as free trade
and democracy and tackle common problems such as terrorism, international
crime and militant Islamic fundamentalism.
He proposed the cross-posting of civil servants between national
administrations to achieve 'the broadest input to problem solving' and to
build 'a network of administrative trust and informal communications' to
cement the community.
The Atlantic Community would rest on four pillars: defence and security as
represented by the Nato alliance; belief in the rule of law and democracy;
liberal capitalism and free trade; and the 'shared European cultural
heritage' of North American and the European Union.
Mr Rifkind said: 'The European Union, Nato, the US and Canada are all the
product of many centuries of European progress and civilisation. An Atlantic
Community would be a historic and appropriate initiative as we approach a
new century and the third millennium.'
Mr Rifkind told a meeting of the Tory Reform Group that the community should
facilitate 'the intimate co-operation, consultation and co-ordination
necessary to protect the common interests' of its members.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Labour puts disenchanted
Tory defector on parade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A black woman who was on the Conservative party's list of approved
candidates yesterday defected to Labour, saying she had given up hope of
being selected by a party which had become out of date and too rightwing.
Ms Joyce Sampson, a civil servant in the Department of Health, also
criticised the Conservative party for moving to the right on Europe and on
social issues. She described herself as a 'one-nation Tory' who no longer
had a place in an increasingly ideological party.
'Over the last few years I have become quite disenchanted by what is
happening in the Tory party and the policies being implemented,' she said.
She also said that she had 'hit a glass ceiling' in the party - coming up
against a lack of progress because of her gender and race.
'It has become very difficult to support the Tory party in a multi-ethnic
society when it refuses to discuss race,' Ms Sampson added. 'The
Conservative party is dying because it has refused to change.'
Five years ago in an interview with a national newspaper Ms Sampson said she
had moved up the Tory party hierarchy because race was not an issue.
'Contrary to what people think no one gives a damn (in the Tory party) if
you do your job well,' she said in 1989.
Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, yesterday said he was delighted
with the defection of such a prominent Tory high flyer.
'Ms Sampson's defection to Labour underlines our early success in recruiting
new members,' said Mr Prescott. 'We are increasing our members by 1,000 a
month while the Tories are losing 1,000 members a month.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US signals flexible stance on finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US has signalled a more flexible stance in negotiations on financial
services left over from the Uruguay Round, a move which trade diplomats say
could help clear the path to a wide-ranging trade liberalising deal.
US officials formally confirmed this week that Washington has dropped its
contentious 'two-tier' approach to opening US financial services markets
such as banking, securities and insurance. The US is also willing to give
developing countries time to phase in liberalisation commitments.
Addressing the first meeting of financial services negotiators in Geneva
since the Uruguay Round global trade accords were concluded last December,
Mr Todd Crawford, a US treasury official, said Washington was no longer
pursuing the two-tier approach and did not intend to reintroduce it.
Disappointed by poor market-opening offers from Japan and a number of east
Asian and Latin American nations, the US last year said it would open only
part of its financial services market on a most-favoured-nation (MFN) basis
 -that is, equally to all trading partners as fair trade rules require.
Access to the remainder, including new market opportunities created by
easier inter-state banking, say, would be granted only to countries which
reciprocated. This stance provoked an outcry among trading partners and came
close to wrecking the Uruguay Round deal.
At the end of the negotiations in December, it was agreed that talks on
financial services would continue into 1995. By then, the US had already
conceded defeat on the two-tier idea.
This was confirmed in September when the 'Quad' trade ministers from the US,
EU, Japan and Canada met in Los Angeles. But Wednesday's ann-ouncement in
Geneva was the first formal statement to partners in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Crawford also said the US did not expect immediate liberalisation of
developing countries' financial services markets. 'We do not expect
liberalisation to take place overnight. We can accept temporary phase-in
arrangements,' he was quoted as saying.
The demise of the two-tier approach does not mean the US will necessarily
open its financial services markets fully to foreign competitors. Like any
other nation it can take MFN exemptions on particular services, enabling it
to offer better bilateral terms. The extent of the exemptions will depend on
how good a deal the US gets from others in the current negotiations.
However, there will be no category of 'conditional MFN' written into the
Uruguay Round agreements.

Lloyds Bank, supported by the British Export Credit Guarantee scheme, has
completed its first export credit to Russia with the signing of a DM114m
(Dollars 74m) loan to Vnesheconombank (The Bank for Foreign Economic
Affairs) to support the export of medical equipment to Russia. The project
is for the supply of radiotherapy cancer treatment equipment, with parts
manufactured in the UK and assembled in Russia in former military factories.
The amount of the Lloyds Bank-led syndicated loan represents 85 per cent of
the value of contracts signed between Russian buyers and Philips Medical
Sytems-Radiotherapy, a division of Philips Electronics UK.

trade relations since the two sides reached a partial trade agreement on
October 1. That agreement did not include cars and car parts, which Tokyo
had proposed be left to the private sector. But Mr Jeffrey Garten, US
undersecretary of commerce, said on Wednesday there would be 'no let-up' in
US pressure on Japan for car concessions. He called for new talks in cars
and parts. A Japanese official said cabinet members and the prime minister
were considering whether Japan should file a formal protest over the

FT  14 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Shipping conference offers concession -
Shipowners try to keep EU competition exemption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shipowners belonging to the Trans-Atlantic Agreement, a controversial
shipping 'conference' which sets cargo rates across the north Atlantic,
yesterday offered a concession designed to defuse their dispute with the
European Commission and exporters.
Lord Sterling, chairman of the P&amp;O shipping line and president of the
European Community Shipowners' Associations, last night proposed dropping
the TAA's constraints on capacity on the north Atlantic routes. The offer
was made during a meeting with Mr Karel Van Miert, the EU competition
commissioner.
Exporters have complained that by restricting capacity as well as setting
rates, the TAA was allowing inefficient shipowners to keep excess tonnage in
operation.
The TAA hopes that by dropping its clause on capacity management it will
persuade the European commission's competition directorate - DG4 - to
continue to grant the shipowners exemption from the normal EU competition
rules.
'We are proposing to drop the capacity angle from the package,' Lord
Sterling said. 'It is not necessary because in practice excess tonnage on
these routes was taken out two years ago.'
This is the second time that the shipowners have made changes to the TAA.
They proposed a compromise agreement, the Trans-Atlantic Conference
Agreement (TACA), in July easing some of the terms of the original 1992
conference.
But shippers, companies which export goods across the Atlantic, said this
was simply a delaying tactic and threatened legal action against the
European commission if it did not speedily issue a ruling on both
agreements.
A second objection to the TAA/TACA - that they set rates for containers on
their land journey to the port, thereby increasing costs - is still rejected
by the shipowners. 'Multimodal shipments (by land and water) are a vital
part of the container industry,' Lord Sterling said. 'The efficiency of
multi-modal shipments is essential to the success of containerisation.
Customers say they do not want anything to do with the cargo from the moment
it leaves the factory gate.'
Shipowners believe that the multi-modal issue does not relate solely to the
TAA/TACA but to conferences generally and should be negotiated separately.
'We want to separate TACA from the multimodal debate,' Lord Sterling said.
The British Shippers' Council, representing UK-based exporters, said it was
heartened by the proposal to drop capacity management from the conference
but remained opposed to shipowners cont-rolling the land leg of a journey.
'We are against the shipowners making profits from inland price-fixing,' Mr
Richard Turner, policy director, said. 'They get the cheapest price (for
inland haulage) by tender and then sell it in a cartel at the dearest
price.'
The TAA/TACA groups 15 large shipping lines which account for 85 per cent of
sailings across the north Atlantic. It was introduced to stem considerable
losses by the shipping lines and its members include Nedlloyd and Maersk.
Exporters say these losses were exaggerated and the conference has been used
to push through excessive rate increases.
The European commission has issued a temporary judgment objecting to the TAA
and is expected to produce a final ruling within the next month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Last minute wrangling by Japan's ruling party politicians with backing from
the powerful rice lobby is threatening to disrupt ratification of a
legislative package to implement the Uruguay Round trade treaty.
Japan has agreed partially to open its rice market from next year, and next
week the cabinet is scheduled to approve Uruguay Round legislation,
including a law on rice production and distribution, before submitting it to
parliament.
However, politicians from farming communities are upset about the absence of
farm subsidy guarantees within a supplementary farm measures package aimed
at supporting farmers affected by implementation of both the international
trade agreements and the Uruguay Round accords.
Some are threatening to boycott approval of the legislation unless a
substantial amount of aid for farmers is included in the support package.
Some politicians have been reported as demanding support amounting to up to
Y6,000bn (Dollars 60bn) over the next six years.
The Ministry of Finance is opposed to any such farm subsidy guarantees and
negotiations with the Agriculture ministry, which is being prodded by the
farm lobby, are deadlocked. The government is expected to announce the
measures next week, and agricultural committees of coalition parties are
pushing Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister, for a political
settlement.
The rice lobby wants Japan to delay Uruguay Round ratification until its
trading partners pass their implementing legislation. Mr Murayama yesterday
endorsed this view in a parliamentary comment that ratification procedures
in the US and EU nations needed to be observed carefully. This means Japan's
ratification of the Uruguay Round legislation package is now unlikely until
the US congress convenes at the end of November to vote on the trade
measures.

<TEXT>
China appears headed for near balanced trade this year after exports surged
in the first nine months. Exports to September exceeded imports by Dollars
1.38bn in a marked turnaround from last year's large trade deficit.
Chinese customs statistics put exports at Dollars 79.44bn in the nine months
to September and imports Dollars 78.06bn. A 1993 deficit on the trading
account had been put at Dollars 12.19bn.
Exports increased by 29.7 per cent against the same period last year. Import
growth rate to September slowed after the boom year in 1993 to 15.2 per
cent. China's GDP growth last year exceeded 13 per cent.
Among reasons for China's impressive export performance was a 50 per cent
devaluation of the local currency in dollar terms after unification of the
exchange rate on January 1.
Domestic manufacturers were also encouraged to seek export opportunities
abroad after measures were adopted last year to restrain growth in an
overheating economy.
Latest statistics show some slowing in export growth consistent with the
pattern of previous years with industrial and consumer demand for imports
picking up in the second half.
Under-reporting of imports during the year also tends to surface in the
latter months of the year, but as an economist said of the good export
figures: 'It's clear that a pretty significant shift has taken place
compared with last year.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / US producer prices down 0.5% in month: Fall in energy costs
holds index back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US producers' prices fell by 0.5 per cent last month, as a sharp drop in
energy prices offset more expensive metals and intermediate goods.
The Department of Labor said the core producer price index, excluding
volatile food and energy prices, rose by just 0.1 per cent in September,
much less than most private sector economists had predicted, leaving a
year-on-year inflation rate of 1.9 per cent.
Prices for crude materials, meanwhile, fell 1.6 per cent, while intermediate
goods prices rose 0.3 per cent, much less than in recent months.
That helped to soothe the financial markets' fears of a surge in inflation,
as many economists watch producer prices as an earlier indicator of
inflationary pressures.
But the core indices for crude and intermediate goods, again excluding food
and energy, rose more sharply in September. Core prices for crude materials
rose by 1.3 per cent in September and have climbed 13.7 per cent in the last
12 months, while prices for core intermediate materials rose by 0.6 per cent
in September and by 3.5 per cent over the last year.
However, Federal Reserve economists tend to regard both the producer price
index and the consumer price index, which is due to be published today, as
more backward-looking measurements than advance warnings of inflationary
pressures.
Although analysts had generally predicted a sharp drop for energy prices,
which fell by 2.9 per cent in September, they miscalculated badly on car
prices.
These fell by 1.1 per cent in September, whereas most analysts, expecting
smaller than usual discounts as dealers sold off vehicles from the last
model year, had expected another increase on top of August's 0.7 per cent.
Tobacco prices, on the other hand, rose by 2.0 per cent after a 1.4 per cent
increase in August and price increases also accelerated for prescription and
over-the-counter drugs, books, mobile homes and household furniture.
Economists disagreed on the implications of the Labour Department's price
data.
Mr Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch described the producer price index as
'terrific'.
'It doesn't mean that there is no inflation pressure. Does it mean that
people have exaggerated the extent of inflationary pressure? I think so,' he
said.
But Mr Joseph Liro of SG Warburg warned: 'As reassuring as the headline
number were, dark clouds remain on the horizon.' He pointed to the rises in
core crude and intermediate goods prices as signs of increasing pressure on
producers to raise their prices.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Brazil awaits election results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of final results for last week's presidential and
congressional elections in Brazil has been delayed amid concerns about
widespread election fraud in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Angus Foster
writes.
The fraud, which involved vote buying and tampering with ballot papers,
seems only to have occurred in elections to the lower house of Congress and
the state legislature.
A special investigator from the capital Braslia was due to arrive yesterday
in Rio to observe the vote counting and was reported to be under heavy armed
protection.
Rio is the only state where counting is still under way. Election
authorities fear that ballot papers which voters had left blank were
subsequently filled in to benefit certain candidates.
Voting is compulsory in Brazil but voters leave their ballot papers blank
either as a protest vote or because they do not know candidates' names.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Plan to crack down on tax 'treaty shopping'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury has proposed new regulations that could crack down on
business arrangements designed to avoid withholding tax by channelling
income through countries with favourable tax treaties with the US.
US officials have been concerned that some multinational companies have been
reducing the amount of withholding tax they pay in the US by funnelling
income from the US through an intermediate company located in a country
whose bilateral tax treaty with the US offers a more favourable withholding
tax treatment.
Under the proposals, the Internal Revenue would be able to disregard
intermediate entities in its assessment of withholding tax, if it believed
the taxpayer had changed the identity of the nominal recipient of income
without changing the substance.
The regulations, which if finalised would implement legislation passed last
year, have been awaited with trepidation by tax lawyers, who feared the
Treasury might embark on a sweeping new approach to 'conduit' issues, where
transactions pass through an intermediate entity.
They could have far-reaching effects on existing business arrangements. Mr
Dennis Ross, a tax partner with the law firm of Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell in
New York, points out that the regulations would apply not only to future
deals, but to all payments, starting 30 days after the regulations are
finalised. They would therefore apply to existing financial arrangements,
even ones which predated last year's legislation.
A typical conduit case might involve a company in the Far East - where the
US has few bilateral tax treaties - avoiding withholding tax by financing
its subsidiary in the US through an offshoot in the Netherlands, with which
the US has a comprehensive treaty.
In fact, the Netherlands tax treaty has recently been renegotiated to
include a clause aimed at preventing such 'treaty shopping', where taxpayers
look around for the country with the most favourable tax treaty.
Anti-treaty shopping provisions are a central element in the US Treasury's
recent efforts to renegotiate many of its bilateral treaties.
But the Treasury failed to win Senate ratification of a package of treaties
 -including an important protocol with Canada - submitted to Congress last
month. This was partly because the Senate ran out of time before it broke
for next month's elections, but also because of opposition from Senator
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Nasa to auction space machinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For sale by private treaty or negotiation: a few boring machines, never
used, one careful owner, apply to auctioneers in London or the US.
The machines, however, are only boring in the engineering sense and the sale
is far from ordinary: more than Dollars 120m (Pounds 76m) of equipment is up
for grabs in a worldwide sale on behalf of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (Nasa). This is the largest sale of space technology
manufacturing plant to come on the open market.
The equipment comes from a Dollars 2bn project to develop an advanced solid
rocket motor for the Space Shuttle. Rocket casings made at Mount Vernon,
Indiana, were to be floated down the Mississippi to a propellant plant at
Iuka, Mississippi, loaded and then floated into the Gulf of Mexico and round
to Cape Canaveral.
Last October, however, with mounting budget pressures and continued safe
performance of the existing shuttle motor, Congress killed the project. The
only problem was that the factories had been built and equipped.
Nasa has given the task of selling the production equipment to National
Industrial Services of the US, which has enlisted Henry Butcher, the London
plant and machinery consultants, to handle the sale outside North America.
The two organisations have to find buyers for some of the world's biggest,
and most sophisticated machine tools - most of them specially built in 1991
to Nasa's exacting standards, and mostly never used. Apart from boring
machines, there are sophisticated machining centres and welding stations,
and everything from overhead cranes to process mixers and electrical
substations.
'This has to be the finest sale of so-called second-hand machine tools and
process plant that has ever come on to the open market,' Mr John Cowing of
Henry Butcher said yesterday. He expected worldwide interest in the sale.
The 100 main items for sale have price tags ranging from Dollars 3m to a
mere Dollars 30,000. It is understood the total raised will be considerably
less than the original investment, which included research and development
spending.
Peripheral building services equipment will be sold in an auction at Iuka on
November 2 and 3, but the main items will go by private treaty or negotiated
sale.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Cardoso's congress challenge: The politics awaiting Brazil's
new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's next president, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, delighted cartoonists
by going fishing after he was elected on October 3. It provided an
irresistible cartoon theme, since he will be spending the coming months
angling for support in Congress.
Mr Cardoso, who takes office on January 1, needs to build a majority in a
Congress which is still maturing after Brazil's return to democracy 10 years
ago. He needs three-fifths support, a more daunting prospect, to make a
number of urgent constitutional reforms. Without strong backing to make
these changes, his presidency could be undermined by factional disputes and
become a weak coalition government, as happened with two of his three
predecessors.
Mr Cardoso has a number of advantages. What is most important, he was
elected with more than 54 per cent of the valid votes. So he does not face
the credibility problems of the current president, Mr Itamar Franco, and
former president, Mr Jose Sarney, who were both promoted from vice-president
rather than being directly elected.
He also has the basis for a working majority in Congress. An election
alliance between his Social Democracy party (PSDB), the right-wing Liberal
Front (PFL) and another smaller party appears to be holding firm. These
parties have 209 senators and deputies and should be able to attract enough
extra votes to guarantee a congressional majority of 298 votes on many
subjects.
The PSDB's strong showing in the elections will also lift Mr Cardoso's power
inside his coalition. The number of PSDB deputies in the lower house is
likely to have increased by half to more than 60, giving it a similar
strength to the historically much larger PFL.
Despite these advantages, Mr Cardoso faces a number of problems. In the
short term, elections for governor for some of the country's most important
states were undecided last week and run-offs will be held next month. Allies
of Mr Cardoso appear likely to win in three key states, Sao Paulo, Rio
Grande do Sul and Bahia. Mr Cardoso needs state governors to support his
planned constitutional reforms in areas such as tax collection and state
spending cuts. If his allies do win in the second round, Mr Cardoso will
have the support of about half of the 27 state governors.
The main obstacle to building congressional alliances is that most
politicians are loyal to individual leaders or local interests rather than
parties or national issues. For example, the PFL is controlled by Mr Antonio
Carlos Magalhaes whose support helped elect 22 deputies for his home state
of Bahia. Mr Magalhaes is backing Mr Cardoso for the moment. But he or other
conservative PFL leaders may not support some of Mr Cardoso's more
adventurous social policies, for example on resettling landless farmers.
A further complicating factor is that about half the new Congress members
were elected for the first time, making it difficult to predict how they
will act. 'It's going to take (Mr Cardoso) time to build a majority and it
won't be unconditional; it will be on a case-by-case basis,' says Mr
Alexandre Barros, a political consultant.
On some subjects, Mr Cardoso will look for support from the Democratic
Movement party (PMDB), the country's largest. Its candidate, Mr Orestes
Quercia, polled less than 5 per cent of votes in the presidential election
and is likely to want the party to oppose Mr Cardoso.
But, says Mr Luiz Pedone, a political scientist, there are four different
factions in the PMDB, and Mr Quercia's appears on the decline. Mr Sarney,
now a PMDB senator, may back Mr Cardoso and take several PMDB deputies with
him. The party's supporters in Rio Grande do Sul also favour supporting Mr
Cardoso rather than Mr Quercia, and may even risk splitting the party.
Even if Mr Cardoso wins over a majority of the PMDB, he may not have the
three-fifths support of Congress needed for constitutional changes. Most
analysts agree the tax and social security systems need to be completed
quickly so as to protect the government's budget.
Some proposals, for example increasing the central government's tax take or
lifting the retirement age, can only be approved via constitutional
amendments and are likely to be unpopular.
The left-wing Workers' party (PT), which will form the nucleus of
opposition, did well in the congressional elections on October 3, increasing
its number of senators from one to five and that of its deputies from 36 to
50. With other left-wing parties, the PT has about half the 156 votes needed
to block any constitutional amendments.
Mr Cardoso is therefore likely to be forced to make a series of shifting
alliances to win support from the right to pass reforms in areas such as tax
reform, and from the left on social issues. Juggling these interests will be
difficult, although Mr Cardoso has proved a skilled negotiator.
The danger is that with the private sector urging him to act quickly to
capitalise on enthusiasm about his election, it will take time to negotiate
these alliances and proposals will be watered down. There is little chance
of constitutional changes being proposed to Congress this year, and
negotiations may not begin until after the Carnival festival next February.
Mr Francisco Weffort, a political scientist at the University of Sao Paulo,
says Mr Cardoso will be able to carry off the juggling act if he guarantees
to opponents and allies that certain sensitive parts of the constitution
will not be changed. As an example, he suggests Mr Cardoso may push for the
lifting of the state's oil monopoly and allow foreign competition by
agreeing not to privatise Petrobras, the state-owned oil company, which many
politicians still see as a strategic national asset.
'He will need to reach some sort of understanding on what can and cannot be
touched for constitutional changes to go ahead,' Mr Weffort says.

The US government will unfreeze the assets of the leaders and supporters of
Haiti's military coup now that many of them are going into exile in Panama
and the US.
Washington also announced that as part of the arrangement to get coup leader
Lt Gen Raoul Cedras to leave Haiti, it would rent his home and beach villa
for at least a year with payment made in advance. US officials denied they
were pampering coup leaders and their families.
'Our intent was to make Cedras' departure as smooth as possible and to hold
down the level of violence,' Mr Stanley Schrager, US embassy spokesman, said
in explaining why the US paid for two charter aircraft, one to take Gen
Cedras and his immediate family to Panama on Wednesday and another to take
23 other relatives and associates to Miami, in addition to leasing his
property in Haiti.
The US military will thus be protecting Gen Cedras' property, preventing the
kind of looting and destruction that happened at the home of former police
chief Michel Francois when he fled to the Dominican Republic last week. Four
US amoured vehicles were stationed outside Gen Cedras' home keeping away a
jubilant crowd that danced and sang songs in support of exiled president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is to return to Haiti tomorrow.
The assets of the coup leaders, which one US official said were 'tens of
millions of dollars', were frozen in mid-1993 as the US increased pressure
on the military to leave power.
Some of the funds were raised through smuggling operations controlled by the
military which circumvented the international economic embargo imposed on
the country. Other assets, according to testimony given to the US Senate in
early 1994, were acquired through drug smuggling operations overseen by the
Haitian military.
President Aristide had been given access to some of the money during his
three years in exile, using it to bankroll extensive lobbying efforts in
Washington.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Airline disunited over flight attendants: United wants to
keep them on but their own union wants them out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next time you take an international flight with United Airlines, the biggest
US airline, spare a thought for the flight attendants. If they are anything
other than American, they may be wondering how much longer they will have a
job.
This would hardly raise an eyebrow if it were simply another case of a
cash-strapped US airline trimming operations to cut costs. In this case,
however, United wants to keep the 1,354 flight attendants it employs at its
three overseas bases; it is the attendants' own trade union that wants them
out.
Of the flight attendants involved, 777 are based in London, 338 in Paris,
and 239 in Taipei. Like their US-based colleagues, these overseas attendants
pay Dollars 39 (Pounds 24.60) a month in membership fees to the Association
of Flight Attendants, the US labour union which all 16,873 United attendants
are required to join.
The union takes their money, but would rather not. It wants United's
overseas bases closed because it says the people employed in them - mainly
Britons and other Europeans in London, French in Paris and Taiwanese in
Taipei - are depriving US nationals of employment on international routes,
which is generally better paid than work on domestic flights.
The row has gone on since the first overseas base opened in London in 1991,
but it came to a head this summer when United succumbed to a union-led
buy-out giving employees a 55 per cent stake in the company in return for
Dollars 4.9bn worth of pay cuts and other concessions. The flight
attendants' union said it would only join the employee buy-out if United
agreed to close the overseas bases.
United refused, for a number of reasons. Its overseas flight attendants,
still relatively new to the airline, are cheaper to employ on international
routes than their US counterparts because they are not as senior. The
geographical spread of the overseas bases gives the airline more flexibility
in planning work rosters and saves money in hotel bills. And the overseas
attendants are said to get on better with United's international passengers
than their US colleagues because they are more in tune with other languages
and cultures.
Since the buy-out, however, events have moved on. United is now owned by its
employees, and Mr Stephen Wolf, the airline's uncompromising chairman and
chief executive, has been replaced by the labour unions' nominee, Mr Gerald
Greenwald. Keen to get the flight attendants into the buy-out scheme, the
new management has been telling the union that it is prepared in principle
to close the overseas bases after all.
The stumbling block has been the seemingly trivial issue of language skills.
United says that if the overseas attendants go, the resulting vacancies can
only be filled by attendants with the appropriate language qualifications.
The union says this is unacceptable because it will in effect bar the
positions to most of its US members.
Now, the issue has been complicated by another factor. Like other employee
groups, the flight attendants have been asked by the management to take a
pay cut - in their case, of 4 per cent - in return for participation in the
buy-out. But in the absence of a deal, the attendants have just received a 4
per cent pay increase under their existing contract of employment. That
means they would now have to take an 8 per cent pay cut to join the buy-out
 -a highly uninviting prospect.
To this extent, the threat of a deal with the management has receded. But
the Association of Flight Attendants says the fact remains that the overseas
bases are having a detrimental affect on the majority of US-based
attendants, and are costing American jobs.
'Will this issue of job exportation go away? No, it won't,' Mr Kevin Lum,
head of the union's master executive council at United, says. 'We are going
to have to find a way to address it.'
As for the overseas attendants, there is little doubt how they feel. The New
York office of the Financial Times recently received an anonymous letter
written on headed notepaper from the New York Helmsley Hotel, a regular
layover hotel for United attendants, accusing the Association of Flight
Attendants of 'treachery' against its fee-paying members. It said: 'To my
knowledge, this would be the first time a labour union has actively
campaigned for its dues-paying members to be effectively fired.'
Ms Fiona MacDonald Hughes, a British flight attendant working from United's
London base, says the letter probably sums up her colleagues' feelings. 'You
have to look at it from the American point of view. It would be the same if
British Airways opened a base in America and didn't send any Britons over,'
she says. 'But people are bitter about the union taking our money and
stabbing us in the back at the same time.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / UN ready with system of weapons monitoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The report on the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons systems handed to
the UN yesterday marks the culmination of an unprecedented effort to destroy
one of the world's biggest national arms efforts.
The slim report handed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, the UN special envoy, to the
Security Council declared 'provisionally operational' a monitoring system
designed to ensure Iraq can never again produce or acquire chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction, in accordance with the
Gulf war ceasefire resolution 687.
The political consequences of this report have still to be worked out,
though Iraq claims it represents proof it has complied fully with the UN's
post Gulf war strictures and that they should thus be rewarded by an easing
of sanctions.
The scale of the enterprise in finding, destroying and monitoring President
Saddam Hussein's deadly arsenal, designed to make Iraq an Arab superpower,
has been colossal.
It has involved the destruction of hundreds of Scud missiles, hundreds of
tonnes of chemical weapons and the detection and dismantling of at least 82
separate sites identified as part of an effort to create nuclear weapons.
Mr Jaako Ylitako, chief field officer for the UN Special Commission, says
over 8,000 people were employed in the chemical weapons industry alone, most
at the al-Muthanna complex south of Baghdad, a plant the size of a big car
factory. He estimates 12,000 were employed in Iraq's nuclear programme, now
halted.
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency will remain
permanently in Iraq, monitoring among other things all Iraq's main rivers to
test for abnormal levels of radiation as a sign of any attempts to cheat.
Experts are to arrive soon to set up similar monitoring systems for Iraq's
biological weapons programme.
More than 45 inspectors are starting to monitor data from 50 cameras
installed at missile production plants and air chemical sensors installed at
chemical works. Weekly flights by a US spy plane, and routine patrols by two
helicopters are designed to ensure Iraq is unable to rebuild elsewhere.
Mr Ylitako says the senior Iraqis who watched destroyed what was once their
most advanced enterprise did so largely impassively. 'But I got the feeling
some of them, as they destroyed all this, were glad to be out of this
business,' he says.

FT  14 OCT 94 / US cool to Iraqi-Russian overture on Kuwaiti border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BAGHDAD, JEDDAH, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Iraq last night announced its 'willingness' to recognise the sovereignty of
Kuwait and its UN-demarcated border, but the US responded coolly, foreseeing
no early easing of sanctions against the Baghdad regime.
The move came in a joint Iraqi-Russian statement after talks between
President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's
foreign minister, who arrived in Baghdad yesterday.
The statement amounts to Iraq's most explicit step towards formal
recognition of Kuwait and its borders - a condition the UN Security Council
demands before lifting any sanctions such as the ban on Iraqi oil exports.
But it fell short of unequivocal recognition, declaring: 'Iraq confirmed its
willingness to solve the issue of recognising Kuwait and its borders as
demanded by Security Council resolution 833 in a positive manner.'
The statement appeared to peg recognition to UN Security Council agreement
to start a six-month test period of Iraq's weapons monitoring programme. Its
ambiguous phrasing suggested Iraq was insisting the UN fix a definite
timetable for the testing, leading naturally to lifting of sanctions.
It stated: 'Following Iraq's formal recognition of Kuwait's sovreignty and
borders, Russia will support the specifying of the start of the formal
operation of the long-term monitoring system in accordance with Security
Council resolution 715.' It said that the monitoring period 'should not
exceed six months', and that 'from the Russian point of view' the Security
Council should then lift sanctions if Iraq had complied during that period.
Although Russia, France and China favoured giving Iraq such a clear
timetable before last week's Iraqi troop movements, Britain and the US have
opposed such a move.
In Washington, a US official said last night an Iraqi agreement to recognise
Kuwait would not lead to an early lifting of UN sanctions. Recognising
Kuwait was 'only one element in the list of things Iraq has to do', the
official said, adding: 'We would not see any possibility of easing sanctions
at this point.'
Nevertheless, Iraq will hope that the Russian initiative, which followed
talks earlier this week between Mr Saddam and two senior Russian envoys,
will re-open debate in the Security Council over linking the lifting of
sanctions to the start of the weapons monitoring programme - debate which
was effectively closed by Iraq's latest troop movements near the Kuwait
border.
Meanwhile, two Iraqi Republican Guard brigades were reported last night to
have halted their withdrawal from the Kuwaiti border area. They were
reported to have dug in around the southern city of Nasiriyah, 100km
north-west of Basra and well within easy striking distance of the Kuwait
border.
A US official said the Iraqi units might believe they had moved far enough
to satisfy US and allied demands. But the Pentagon said the Iraqis were
still close enough to strike quickly into Kuwait.
Earlier, Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, said the US troop build-up
in the Gulf would reach only 30,000 and troops could start going home within
weeks after Iraq withdraws forces from the Kuwait border. A more powerful
force of US warplanes would remain for the foreseeable future.
US and French officials clashed yesterday over US proposals for a military
exclusion zone in southern Iraq. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the
UN, called Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, 'ill-informed and
counter productive' for saying the build-up of US troops in Kuwait was 'not
unconnected' to US domestic politics. She said Mr Leotard's remarks 'give
comfort to a brutal dictator' and suggested France's position was motivated
by its commercial links with Iraq.
The row spoilt efforts by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to
paper over differences among western allies on establishing an exclusion
zone in southern Iraq.
The US has stepped back from earlier suggestions for barring tanks and heavy
military equipment from a vast demilitarised zone stretching up to the 32nd
parallel - the boundary of the existing no-fly zone. But US officials insist
some way must be found to avoid having to make costly troop deployment any
time Mr Saddam wants to play cat-and-mouse games.
Mr Hurd, speaking at a press conference in Bahrain before flying to Saudi
Arabia, said an exclusion zone was an option which came under the category
of 'some way' to be found to stop a recurrence of the Iraqi troop build-up.
Another option, a pre-emptive airstrike, appears to have receded.
One problem with a ground exclusion zone, which mirrors the air exclusion
zone, is that it could be seen as a step towards dismemberment of Iraq.
Although no western country wants Mr Saddam to remain in power, they remain
committed to the territorial integrity of Iraq, if only as a buffer against
Iran.

US and French officials clashed sharply yesterday over American proposals
for establishing a military exclusion zone in southern Iraq.
Ms Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the UN, called Mr Francois
Leotard, the French defence minister, 'very ill-informed and counter
productive' for saying the build-up of US troops in Kuwait to counter an
apparent threat from Iraq was 'not unconnected to domestic politics'.
Ms Albright said Mr Leotard's remarks 'give comfort to a brutal dictator who
is a repeat offender,' and suggested that France's own position was
motivated by its commercial links with Iraq.
The row spoilt efforts by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, to
paper over differences among western allies on establishing an exclusion
zone in southern Iraq.
The US has stepped back from earlier suggestions for barring tanks and heavy
military equipment from a vast demilitarised zone stretching up to the 32nd
parallel - the boundary of the existing no-fly zone.
Nevertheless, US officials insist some way must be found to avoid having to
make a costly troop deployment any time Iraqi President Saddam Hussein wants
to play mouse and cat games.
'For the future, obviously, we do not want to have to face Saddam Hussein's
threats every few years in intimidating his neighbours and intimidating the
UN, so we are in the process of trying to negotiate a resolution in the UN
that would give us more permanent protection for the future,' Mr Leon
Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said yesterday.
Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, said the US troop build-up would
reach only 30,000 and the troops could start returning home within weeks
after Iraq withdraws forces from the Kuwait border.
A more powerful force of US warplanes would remain for the foreseeable
future to police Baghdad's actions and make sure Mr Saddam does not again
threaten moderate Gulf states.
The bulk of US combat troops will leave quickly when Iraqi forces complete
their current retreat from southern Iraq, Mr Perry told reporters travelling
with him from Washington to visit with American forces and hold talks with
government leaders in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
The peak of American troops expected to reach the Gulf would thus fall far
short of the nearly 200,000 combat troops that Washington was prepared to
send unless Iraq backed down.
Mr Hurd, speaking at a press conference in Bahrain before flying to Saudi
Arabia, said an exclusion zone was an option which comes under the category
of 'some way' to be found to stop a recurrence of the Iraqi troops build-up.
Another option, a pre-emptive airstrike, appears to have receded.
One problem with a ground exclusion zone, which mirrors the air exclusion
zone is that it could be seen as a step towards the dismemberment of Iraq.
Although no western country wants Mr Saddam to remain in power, they remain
committed to the territorial integrity of Iraq, if only as a buffer against
Iran.
The Gulf states generally, and Saudi Arabia in particular, are highly
nervous about what officials call Iran's subversive inclinations. Saudi
Arabia regards Iran as a threat because it encourages Islamic extremists
within the kingdom in their anti-western stance.
Officials say that if the imposition of an extensive ground exclusion zone
now looks unlikely, more limited territorial restrictions could be imposed.
There could be a military free-zone organised around Basra, a tank-free zone
that would allow ground troops to remain in southern Iraq, or more intensive
monitoring of Iraqi troop movements.
Russia yesterday intensified its attempts to create a durable diplomatic
resolution with the arrival in Baghdad of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, on a shuttle that would also include several Gulf states.
Diplomats in Baghdad said Mr Kozyrev is likely to seek a formula which might
revive the prospect of giving Iraq a set of definitive criteria for an
eventual lifting of sanctions, on condition that Iraq commits itself to the
unequivocal recognition of its border with Kuwait.
Moscow might also be eyeing an eventual revival of Iraq as a purchaser of
conventional weaponry, which would be permitted once sanctions are lifted.
Mr Hurd said sanctions against Iraq must remain.
'Iraq has not recognised Kuwait. I do not know of any country which favours
lifting sanctions while this situation continues,' Mr Hurd said.
US military officials say no limit has been set on how long US troops will
stay in Kuwait, and this could depend on the success of US negotiations in
the UN.

FT  14 OCT 94 / War of nerves carries a crippling price tag: Two generations
of Kuwaitis have been cocooned from income tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kuwait is once again bracing itself to pay a large part of the costs for the
US - and British - military presence in Kuwait and the northern Gulf as a
result of the latest confrontation with Iraq.
But in spite of paying out, by its own estimates, Dollars 47bn - half its
total reserves - to finance the cost of coalition forces liberating Kuwait
in 1991, the government has barely started to educate the public, let alone
convince the national assembly (parliament) that the days of a tax-free
existence are over.
On Wednesday Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US,
Britain and the six states of the Gulf Co-operation Council (Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE) had agreed 'to share the cost
of the joint effort and to set up a fund', which would assess the costs and
agree the amounts to be paid by each.
In practice, however, Kuwait is uneasily aware it and Saudi Arabia will be
expected to come up with the lion's share, which will increase the longer US
forces are stationed in Kuwait for its protection.
Already, Kuwaiti newspapers are reflecting public concern about the extent
and the permanence of Iraq's withdrawal. 'How soon, how far, how long?' ran
the headline in Wednesday's Arab Times. Kuwaitis have concluded that this
chapter in the war of nerves will continue for some time.
If the last Gulf crisis cost Kuwait Dollars 47bn and Saudi Arabia some
Dollars 60bn, this time around the figures may be in the low billions of
dollars.
'Whatever has to be done will be done,' Mr Ali Rashaid al-Bader, managing
director of the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), said.
The KIA manages Kuwait's reserves both in the State General Reserve, which
holds all of the unrealisable assets such as historic and irredeemable loans
to third-world countries, allocations to international institutions such as
the IMF, and assets of Kuwait Airways; and the Reserve Fund for Future
Generations (RFFG), which contains the quality and liquid assets.
A recent report by the planning ministry put the total value of Kuwait's
reserves for the fiscal year ending June 30 1994 at KD18.5bn (Dollars 61bn).
Of this Dollars 23.1bn was in the general reserve, and the larger amount,
Dollars 37.9bn, in the RFFG. According to Al-Shall Economic Consultants,
KIA's investment income and asset appreciation last year added Dollars 6bn
to the value of reserves.
However, actual budget deficits for the last three years have amounted to
KD1.57bn (Dollars 5.2bn) in 1992/93, KD1.2bn (Dollars 4bn) in 1993/94, and
is projected at KD1.85bn (Dollars 6.1bn) for this fiscal year. Economists
have pointed out that oil revenues, which make up 88 per cent of the total,
are conservatively predicated at Dollars 12 a barrel; and further that
annual defence costs of KD500m (Dollars 1.65bn) are for the first time
included in estimated expenditures. Set against this is the likelihood this
year of lower returns from KIA investments and the fact that budget defence
figures represent only current expenditure, not capital costs for arms
purchases.
The defence reinforcement budget amounts to Dollars 11.5bn, to be spread
over 12 years from 1992, at the rate of up to roughly Dollars 1bn a year.
But the government has already spent or committed Dollars 4bn in two years.
Defence expenditure now accounts for 70 per cent of total average oil
revenue of the last two fiscal years. Commitments from this most recent
crisis will mean still more outflows.
The national assembly has consistently refused to countenance any suggestion
of income taxes on Kuwaiti residents or any corporate tax on Kuwaiti
companies. For two generations Kuwaitis have been cocooned. This latest
crisis is beginning to concentrate their minds.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Tokyo takes big step to financial deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The approval by the Japanese ministry of finance yesterday for the banks -
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sakura and Mitsubishi - to set up securities
offshoots is a substantial relaxation of the country's strictly controlled
financial system.
It is the latest stage of a gradual dismantling of barriers between banks
and securities companies. The government has suggested further deregulation
of the financial system may follow in the next few years.
To protect existing brokers, the banks' securities offshoots will be not be
able to trade in equities but will be restricted to corporate bond issuance.
The first banks permitted to run broking businesses - long-term credit banks
 -started operations late last year. The ministry announced then that
commercial banks, the country's largest banks, would be permitted to enter
the market by the end of 1994.
Since then, the banks and the ministry have been discussing the structure
and financing of the planned subsidiaries. Earlier this week the ministry
approved the final details.
The move is crucial to the banks' long-term profitability. Japanese
corporations, in the past heavily dependent on bank lending, have recently
turned increasingly to securities issuance for finance. While that business
was barred to banks they risked losing customers to the brokers who hitherto
held a monopoly.
Small and medium-sized brokers are likely to be the principal losers. They
have already lost business to the securities units of the long-term credit
banks, and will cede substantially more to city banks. They are continuing
to lobby the authorities to keep banks out of equity trading.
The larger brokers are also seeking a share in the banks' own activities.
But as long as the banking sector remains weak, such a move seems unlikely.
When banks are permitted to conduct the full range of broking business,
further consolidation of the financial sector is likely as unprofitable
brokers are rescued by banks and larger brokers. That process will further
remove barriers between the two sectors.
One name that will not immediately be joining the list of new securities
companies is Sumitomo. The world's largest bank failed to submit an
application to the ministry because of a disagreement over the new company's
proposed name.

Mr Kenzaburo Oe yesterday won the Nobel prize for literature, becoming only
the second Japanese writer to receive the world's most prestigious literary
award. Mr Oe's achievement lay in 'creating an imagined world where life and
myth condense to form a disturbing picture of the human predicament,' said
the Swedish Academy of Letters. Yasunari Kawabata was the previous Japanese
prizewinner in 1968. Last year the female Afro-American novelist Toni
Morrison won the award.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs of economic recovery in Australia emerged yesterday with the
announcement of a continuing growth in the number of jobs created during the
last three months. Figures published by the official statistics bureau
showed the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained at 9.5 per cent in
September, despite the substantial rise in the number of people who actively
looked for jobs during the month.
Nearly 76,000 jobs were created in September, while the 'participation
rate', the percentage of working age population actively seeking work, rose
to 63.3 per cent from 62.8 per cent in August. Mr Simon Crean, the
employment minister, said this reflected the confidence of the labour force
in a growing economy. The Labor government's promise of creating 500,000
jobs in five years (from 1993) will be easily achieved. During the last
three months, 140,000 jobs have been created and analysts are predicting
that the 3 per cent growth in employment forecast in the government's
1994/95 budget will be exceeded. New capital expenditure during the three
months to June increased 7.7 per cent in constant prices, the best figure
since the September quarter of 1990. Spending on plant equipment during the
period rose 14 per cent in real terms.

FT  14 OCT 94 / The dirt clogs up Zaire's new broom: Reforming PM Kengo runs
into resistance from the state and business 'mafia'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHELA WRONG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Zaire's main airport used to be most people's idea of hell on earth. Landing
at Dnjili, passengers would spend hours being passed from one security
service to another, each demanding its bribe, while hangers-on, promising
they could - at a price - smooth a passage through the official maze, vied
for the role of 'protocol'.
A perfect symbol of the corrupt anarchy that is Zaire, it was one of the
first targets of a radical clean-up cited by prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo
on his accession to power.
Three months into his premiership, the airport has been transformed into a
zone where it is sometimes possible to emerge without handing over a petit
cadeau (little gift). Optimists point to this as a sign of Mr Kengo's
determination to impose order. Cynics say it is the only miracle he is going
to be able to pull off.
Mr Kengo is trying to put Zaire back on the diplomatic map this week. He is
visiting France and Belgium in an effort to restore ties.
Indeed, western approval is the main incentive for President Mobutu Sese
Seko to co-operate with Mr Kengo. Being denied a visa to visit his villas
abroad and having aid abruptly cut off because of his failure to institute
democratic reform hurt Mr Mobutu's pride.
When nominated in June, Mr Kengo was regarded as a consensus candidate who
unlike Mr Etienne Tshisekedi, the radical opposition leader he elbowed
aside, would be capable of working alongside Mr Mobutu. Both the opposition
and Mr Mobutu's supporters knew it was time to end the 15-month stalemate in
which two governments competed for legitimacy and no one ran the country.
An experienced political operator, he immediately started making the noises
the disillusioned international community wanted to hear. He promised to put
a stop to official corruption, bring the anarchic armed forces under
control, stabilise the currency and rein in inflation, halt the smuggling
that yearly robs the country of a fortune in diamonds, gold, cobalt and
uranium, and restore something approaching autonomy to the Bank of Zaire,
long treated as a bottomless purse by President Mobutu and his army
generals.
The battered national currency, the new Zaire, launched in October at three
to the dollar, now trades at 2,500. In July Mr Kengo suspended the Bank of
Zaire's governor, a Mobutu appointee, accusing him of recklessly printing
notes. Recently he has disclosed two operations - one run by a Lebanese
businessman, the other by a Zairean with close ties to Mr Mobutu's son -
that would have smuggled 45 tonnes of counterfeit bills into the country.
For decades, what the opposition press describes as a 'mafia' of corrupt
Lebanese and foreign businessmen, protected by the army generals and members
of the presidential entourage, have become rich breaking the rules. By
cracking down on such activities, Mr Kengo is challenging a powerful elite,
one, moreover, that was instrumental in getting him nominated over Mr
Tshisekedi.
'Kengo is talking tough, which is great,' says a Kinshsa-based diplomat.
'But if the end result is to convince Mobutu's parliamentary supporters
they're not going to get their share of the pie, then he could come tumbling
down.'
Obstacles are surfacing in Mr Kengo's path. Zaire's attorney-general has put
the investigation into the counterfeit smuggling operation on ice, claiming
he does not have the means to carry it through.
At the customs authority and the national tax office, two key institutions
in which state revenues traditionally evaporate into thin air, employees are
fiercely resisting changes ordered by the government.
'We get the impression that we don't control anything much,' admits one of
Mr Kengo's aides. 'Mobutu, the radical opposition and Mobutu's parliamentary
supporters are all trying to trip Kengo up. He is a very isolated figure.'
Mr Kengo's powerlessness is most bleakly evident when it comes to security.
His predecessor used the army to terrorise the opposition, muffle the press
and bully human rights activists. The systematic repression has stopped, but
the under-paid army behaves like an occupation force, setting up road
barricades, demanding money at gunpoint, stealing cars.
At the same time, Mr Kengo has failed to alleviate the day-to-day problems
of ordinary people. Annualised, inflation in the first three months of Mr
Kengo's tenure was 24,200 per cent. With the state no longer providing
minimum services, parents are having to find precious hard currency to pay
teachers in state schools and doctors in public hospitals.
If the premier were forced to resign because the ground had been cut from
under him, President Mobutu could still lose all his hard-won gains. So the
outcome is probably procrastination - allowing Mr Kengo a semblance of power
while quietly subverting policies that threaten presidential privileges.
It is a tactic, after all, that has worked well since Mr Mobutu announced
the dawn of a democratic era more than four years ago.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Radical reform of UN peacekeeping urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical reform of the United Nations system of crisis prevention,
peacekeeping and humanitarian relief is called for in a hard-hitting
post-mortem on the Rwanda emergency, published yesterday by the British
charity Oxfam.
The report places primary responsibility for the genocide, this summer, when
up to 1m died, on extremist Rwandan politicians. But the international
community and its most powerful member states have through 'complacency and
inaction, contributed to the slaughter'. The catalogue of failure,it says,
included:
Failure to put sufficient pressure on the Rwandan government to comply with
a UN special rapporteur's recommendations in August 1993, notably
dismantling party militias.
Pressure on the UN secretary-general to save money by cutting the UN force
in Rwanda between October 1993 and March 1994.
Arms supplies, notably by France and the US, to the previous Rwandan
government, despite evidence of gross human rights violations.
Cutting the UN force by 75% after 10 Belgian soldiers were killed in April
1994.
Deliberate delay by major powers in the Security Council in setting up a new
peacekeeping force. The US, according to Oxfam, 'took the lead in this
shameful abdication of responsibility', refusing to acknowledge genocide was
taking place and lobbying to confine the new force to border areas, despite
'clear evidence the majority under threat were within Rwanda'.
Failure by the most powerful UN members to offer troops and failure to
provide sufficient equipment and logistical support for troops offered by
African states. As a result the second UN force did not arrive until months
after killings began and 'genocide proceeded unabated and unopposed'.
Oxfam admits it is unrealistic to suggest a UN force of 5,500 could have
brought killings to an immediate halt. But 'the lame excuses of governments.
. . have been given the lie by the successful protection of thousands of
civilians by the rump UN force that remained in Kigali, by the ability of
the French troops to restore security in the south-west, and by the speed
with which Security Council members deployed troops when they chose to act,
in response to the refugee crisis in Goma'.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Confidence improves in EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business and consumer confidence is improving across the European Union,
according to the latest survey from the European Commission. The survey's
industrial confidence indicator is compiled from business people's replies
on a number of issues, such as order books and selling price expectations.
In September, the industrial confidence indicator improved to zero, from -1
in August and -14 in the first quarter of the year. The Commission said a
rise in order books was mainly responsible for the improvement in sentiment.
The consumer confidence indicator also improved from -14 in August to -12 in
September. The main reason for the upturn was that consumers were more
confident about the general economic situation; there was no improvement in
their expectations for their own finances. The most confident consumers were
to be found in Ireland and the least confident in Portugal. Among
industrialists, Ireland also topped the confidence polls, while German
business people were the most pessimistic.

The present and former chairmen of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, the Spanish

financed the ruling Socialist party in the late 1980s. Investigating judge,
Mr Marino Barbero, is due to question senior Socialist party officials later
this month and he could wind up a two-year inquiry into the corruption
scandal before the end of the year. Mr Emilio Ybarra and his predecessor as
BBV chairman, Mr Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, are among several top Spanish
executives linked to Filesa, a Barcelona-based firm of consultants run by
senior Socialist officials that took receipts totalling some Dollars 8bn
(Pounds 5bn) in return for sector reports which in most cases have failed to

A Bulgarian investment company is to reduce the value of its investors'
savings from Lv1.1bn (Dollars 17m) to Lv1m (Dollars 15,600), according to
the Bulgarian financial daily, Pari. The East-West International Holding
Group said its financial 'difficulties' were due to poor management of
incorporated companies based abroad, but business analysts believe East-West
is simply another east European pyramid scheme which exploits naive
investors unfamiliar with capitalism. Two months ago East-West suspended
payments and stopped trading at the Sofia stock exchange. Worried
shareholders queued in front of the company's headquarters in Sofia
yesterday to demand their money back, but were told that payment was
suspended. Some 8,000 people have bought 364,345 non-voting shares of
East-West at a price of Lv1,000, which are worth Lv1. East-West president
Ivo Nedyalkov, who controls the company's majority stake of voting shares,
was reported to be in London. 'Now I understand what East-West International
really means,' said an investor, 'we remain in the east and our money goes
west, together with Nedyalkov.'

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's media went on strike yesterday ahead of today's four-hour general
stoppage called by the trade unions to protest against pension and welfare
cuts in the 1995 budget. The three main trade union confederations behind
the strike have called for a massive response and have organised more than
60 demonstrations around the country. The stoppage is expected to bring
Italy to a standstill despite the refusal of unions in some sectors to take
action.
In the run-up to the protest, the government has been trying to table a
rapid series of amendments to correct obvious cases of injustice in the
proposals for pension reform. The main category at risk are those who have
filed notice with their employers to retire, or who have just retired. Under
the terms of the existing proposal, they will not be able to draw a pension
until February 1995. In making the amendments, Mr Clemente Mastella, the
labour minister, hinted that the government is willing to reopen discussions
with the unions. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has, meanwhile, held a
meeting with trade union leaders, signalling that should the social climate
become tenser after the general strike, he would be willing to act as a
mediator.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Ukraine avoids currency panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's volatile currency, the karbovanets, has fallen sharply in recent
days, losing 6 per cent of its value against the dollar yesterday and 12 per
cent since Monday, raising fears of higher inflation this winter. The
karbovanets, also called the coupon, sold at 100,000 to the dollar on the
open market yesterday, a 50 per cent fall since September 12.
The currency's latest fall follows Ukraine's decision last Friday to abolish
the government's artificial exchange rate and reopen free currency auctions.
The move was the first step in a comprehensive economic reform programme
announced by President Leonid Kuchma earlier this week, but, thanks to
inflationary credits inherited from the previous administration, the initial
impact of reform has been further destabilisation. Unlike the panic caused
by the Russian rouble's sharp fluctuations, Ukrainians this week remained
nonplussed about the latest devaluations. Public confidence in the
karbovanets has never recovered from last year's hyper-inflation - when the
annual inflation rate exceeded 10,000 per cent - and, although many
purchases are made in karbovantsi, few Ukrainians hold their savings in the
national currency.
This autumn's devaluation stems largely from a massive credit release to
agriculture this summer. The credits, authorised by parliament, derailed the
Ukrainian central bank's tight monetary policy, which brought the inflation
rate down to single digits during the first half of the year. As a result,
commercial banks are releasing around Kbv5,000bn (Dollars 53.2m) onto the
currency exchange market each week, according Mr Mykola Melnychuk, a
Ukrainian national bank official.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Rural Finland holds out against EU: Finnish farmers have a
worse deal with Brussels than the Germans and Danes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vesa Rantala farms 40 boggy hectares carved out of the Finnish forest by
his great-grandfather. Like the vast majority of Finland's agricultural
community, he is going to vote No in Sunday's referendum on joining the
European Union. He expresses his opposition with a farmer's characteristic
bluntness.
'The deal with Brussels on Finnish farming is crazy,' Mr Rantala declares,
raising his voice to be heard above the noisy lowing of his small herd of
dairy cows, already brought inside the cattle shed for the long Nordic
winter.
Although opinion polls signal the outcome on Sunday will be a yes to EU
membership, the determined opposition of Mr Rantala and his fellow farmers
has formed the core of a no campaign which has unsettled the pro-EU
political establishment in Helsinki.
Farmers make up only 7 per cent of Finland's 2m workforce and agriculture
accounts for less than 3 per cent of economic output. But their influence
extends far beyond the limits suggested by such figures in a country where
more than 35 per cent of the 5m population still live in rural areas and
many more believe it is important to avoid rural depopulation, in part to
protect the nation's security on its long border with Russia.
The farm community is the bedrock of support for the Centre party, which
under the leadership of Mr Esko Aho, the present prime minister, became the
country's biggest political party in the last general election and leads the
ruling coalition government. The party is split over the issue and several
senior party figures are campaigning for a no vote.
The angry opposition to the EU by the farmers, orchestrated by their union,
the MTK, is therefore the most serious obstacle facing the government, and
the main opposition Social Democratic party, in their efforts to win
Sunday's referendum.
What makes the farming issue awkward is a feeling among many Finns - even
those who do not believe the EU vote should be decided on agriculture - that
the EU farm deal is unfair on Finland.
Under the terms for Finland's accession to the EU, the Union rejected
Helsinki's demand that the whole country be treated as a special
agricultural case because of its severe Arctic and sub-Arctic climate.
Instead, a complex map was drawn up dividing the country into areas which
qualified for differing grades of agricultural and regional subsidies and
support. The majority of the country qualifies at least as a so-called Less
Favoured Area, or LFA, eligible for subsidies on a per-hectare basis on top
of normal EU price support.
But 15 per cent of Finland - the most southerly regions where most of the
country's cereal and vegetable production is based - does not qualify. Mr
Rantala's farm, in the district of Elimaki about 110km north-east of
Helsinki, falls some 15km outside the LFA limit. This means that he does not
qualify for any extra subsidies, despite the fact that thousands of farms in
more productive regions of the EU well to the south of southern Finland do
fall within LFAs.
The MTK says its studies show that farms in LFA-designated regions of
Germany may receive up to three-times the EU subsidy available to farmers
like Mr Rantala, despite having land with average cereal yields  - at almost
7 tonnes per hectare - twice as high as in Finland.
This is because their higher yields trigger higher payments under the Common
Agricultural Policy reform programme and they receive LFA payments.
'This is the problem,' says Mr Rantala, a Centre party local councillor
whose 40 hectares is divided between pasture, hay and cereals. 'When they
are sowing spring seed, our land is still snowbound. We cannot sow until
May. The quality of our soil and climate is so different. It is ridiculous
that I am put on a worse basis than farmers in Germany and Denmark.'
The other furious complaint by the MTK is over the EU insistence that
Finland must adjust immediately on joining the union next January to the CAP
price regime - and open its previously restricted market to agricultural
imports from the rest of the community.
With the EU already under strong international pressure to cut its existing
price supports, Finland can hardly expect to escape reforms of an
agricultural system even more heavily subsidised than the Union's.
But as Finland has maintained producer prices at levels up to 60 per cent
higher than those prevailing in the EU, this implies a big shock for Finnish
farmers. The government in Helsinki has negotiated the right to soften the
impact through a five-year programme of transitional aid worth FM4bn (Pounds
500m) next year.
But farmers complain it is still not clear how this will be implemented and
they say that, in any case, they will face reductions in income of between
10-45 per cent next year, depending on where their farms are located. Mr
Rantala says the average price he receives now for the 113,000 litres of
milk he produces per year - his chief source of revenue - is FM2.70 per
litre.
The EU price, he says, is around FM1.90 per litre. He does not yet know for
sure what price he will get if Finland joins the union.
'We had the minister of agriculture up here last week and he promised
decisions. But it's still not clear. None of the figures seem final. I don't
know what the price will be on January 1, but I have to vote on Sunday.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's trade surplus climbs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norway's September trade surplus, excluding ships and oil platforms, jumped
to NKr4.71bn (Pounds 448m) from NKr1.96bn in last year's comparative period,
bolstered by a 29 per cent rise in exports, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said yesterday. A sharp increase in the value of oil and gas exports and
fish were mainly behind the advance. September export volumes of oil and gas
were NKr6bn, against NKr8bn last month. This was mainly due to lower crude
oil prices and reduced output, which was caused by extended work programmes
during annual maintenance of offshore platforms. Karen Fossli, Oslo
Sweden's consumer price index rose 0.9 per cent in September from August.
The monthly figures brought the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.7 per cent,
unchanged from August but down from 4.2 per cent in September 1993.
France's gross domestic product grew at an inflation-adjusted rate of 1 per
cent in the second quarter of this year. The increase is in line with market
expectations and is identical to the provisional estimate.
Spanish registered unemployment rose to 16.54 per cent in September from
16.34 per cent in August. It was marginally down on the 16.60 per cent in
September 1993.

The prime minister, Mr Esko Aho, says he expects Finns to vote for European
Union membership in their referendum on Sunday,
Recent opinion polls have shown Finns leaning strongly towards joining the
EU. Mr Aho, chairman of the agrarian-based Centre party, said there would be
some disadvantages to membership, like the impact on agriculture which must
adopt to much lower producer prices. 'And it is quite clear that sometimes
it is going to be difficult also to accept decisions not made at home,' Mr
Aho said in an interview. 'So it means that in certain way our independence
is going to be decreased.' Mr Aho, whose country shares a 1,270km border
with Russia, said he hoped Moscow would continue with reforms. Asked if
Finland would feel greater security in EU membership, he said: 'It is very
important to notice that we have no reason to see Russia as a military
threat.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   COTTBUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
To many Germans, the Cottbus region of eastern Germany, close to the border
with both Poland and the Czech Republic, represents declining brown coal
industry, spiralling unemployment and rampaging skinheads.
But if Chancellor Helmut Kohl wins the election this Sunday it will be
partly because life is a good deal better than it seems in places like
Cottbus.
The Chancellor himself is criticised for promising more than he could
deliver in 1990 and this week drew only 4,000 people to the town centre,
compared with 100,000 in 1990. Nevertheless, Chancellor Kohl's 4,000 was ten
times larger than the crowd attracted two weeks before by Mr Oskar
Lafontaine, the Social Democrat deputy leader.
Voting for the local council is divided evenly between the Christian
Democrats, Social Democrats and the PDS, the former communists, but politics
is characterised more by apathy than extremism.
Unemployment is high but the men who drink beer at the snack bars all day
are not representative.
Indeed, at 14.6 per cent, unemployment is high, but is down from 18 per
cent. Seventy per cent of the 42,000 registered unemployed in the region are
women, according to Mr Karl Fuhrmann, head of the federal labour office in
Cottbus. For men it is only 8.2 per cent - around the all-German average -
but for women it is 21.4 per cent.
This is surprising given the recent restructuring of coal mining and other
heavy industries. Part of the explanation is that women used to dominate in
the now-decimated textile and chemical industries. They also tended to
occupy the least qualified jobs in public administration which were the
first to be cut.
The social net is more than holding together, albeit at high cost to
Germany's public finances. 'There is no classical poverty here, and the
unemployed are a lot better off than the people in Poland just a few miles
away,' says Mr Fuhrmann.
According to Ms Karin Tesker, a west German who works helping with
unemployed east German women, some married women are relieved that the
enforced full employment of the old regime is past and they need not work.
Mrs Uta Langfeld, from the local club for the unemployed, agrees that the
stress of unemployment is more psychological than financial. The real pain
of adjustment, she says, has fallen on the 40-50 age group. Pensioners are
far better off and the young find it easier to adapt.

FT  14 OCT 94 / German Elections: Quirk of voting system may deny Kohl

coalition partners fail 5% hurdle

The one dark doubt that must linger in the mind of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
as he approaches Sunday's general election, is that he may yet win the poll
 -and still lose the contest to form the next coalition. He is campaigning
flat out for all the votes he can get, and yet ironically, he ought to be
giving some away to ensure that he can carry on as chancellor for another
four years.
'We have no votes to lend, and none to give away,' Mr Kohl insists. Logic
indicates otherwise.
All the opinion polls suggest that he has pulled his Christian Democratic
Union back in front of all contenders, with around 42 per cent of popular
support shared with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union.
The most probable outcome is therefore a continuation of the
conservative-liberal coalition, with the CSU and the liberal Free Democratic
Party, but with a reduced majority.
The trouble for Mr Kohl is that the FDP, chronically weak in a series of
state elections, may fail to win enough seats to give him a clear majority.
If simultaneously, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed
communists from East Germany, gets into the Bundestag, the coalition
calculations will be very finely balanced.
The key to it all lies in the German twin-vote system, which is essentially
a system of proportional representation, but with a particular German twist.
First votes are for individual candidates in their constituencies, but it is
the second votes - for party lists in each state - which decide the make-up
of the Bundestag, the directly elected parliament. Regardless of how many
seats they win on the first vote, the final division of the Bundestag is
based entirely on the second vote.
It is thus second votes which count, although opinion polls suggest that
only some 45 per cent of the electorate realise this. The first votes only
decide the personalities who are guaranteed places among the successful
candidates on the party list.
To make the grade at all, a party must win at least 5 per cent of the second
votes, setting a hurdle which most of the fringe parties, including the
far-right Republicans and Deutsche Volksunion, have found impossible to
cross.
That is the hurdle which the FDP may fail to clear, as it has failed in the
last seven state elections. The Greens failed in 1990, but look likely to
make it this time.
But there is an exception to the rule, which the PDS in east Germany hopes
to exploit. If a party can win at least three seats directly on the first
vote, it can claim whatever percentage of the second votes it wins in the
Bundestag, even if it is less than 5 per cent.
Mr Gregor Gysi, the PDS leader in the outgoing Bundestag, is hoping to win
his own seat and two others in east Berlin, and thus claim anything up to 30
seats in the Bundestag, based on a probable proportion of second votes of
around 4 per cent. He could well end up holding the balance of power between
the CDU/CSU and the SPD/Greens.
Christian Democrat voters thus face a very tough decision on a national
basis, and a very easy one in east Berlin.
In the first place, they must decide whether they can afford to give any
second votes away to the FDP, to guarantee the continuation of the present
coalition. The votes could be wasted if the FDP fails to make 5 per cent,
and then the CDU would be doubly weakened. Or they could be just what Mr
Kohl needs to ensure that the FDP gets more than 5 per cent, thus enabling
him to reform the current coalition.
West German tradition suggests that the FDP will get enough CDU second votes
to get by. But the same tradition has no roots among the newly enfranchised
voters in the east. The 5 per cent will be harder to come by than it has
ever been before.
The easy decision is for CDU supporters in those seats in east Berlin which
the PDS hopes to win. They can afford to give their first votes to the SPD
candidates most likely to defeat the PDS, and still give their crucial
second votes to the CDU: the individual PDS candidates can be defeated, but
the CDU will remain just as strong overall in the Bundestag.
The problem for Mr Kohl is twofold. He cannot be seen to be encouraging his
supporters to practise such cynical tactical voting. But he cannot be sure
that they understand the voting system well enough to realise that giving
away their first votes will not harm the CDU at all.
Strong rumours from east Germany suggest that CDU party workers are trying
to spread the message to keep the PDS out of the Bundestag with the first
votes. It may not be clear until past midnight on Sunday night whether they
have succeeded.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Balladur boards scandals bandwagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The arrest of Mr Alain Carignon, mayor of Grenoble and a former minister, on
a new charge of corruption has set Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and his
political rivals vying with each other to be seen cleansing the country's
political system.
Mr Balladur, who said yesterday France's politico-financial scandals were
poisoning its political life, is hoping to avoid new legislation on
political funding by getting parties to agree on codes of conduct to
reinforce existing laws.
His four-point plan includes:
Audits of politicians' personal assets.
Making bids and awards on public contracts more transparent.
A reduction in election spending.
An ethics code for senior civil servants joining the private sector.
However, Mr Philippe Seguin, the National Assembly president, has convened
similar all-party negotiations in the parliament, with the aim of producing
legislative proposals by the end of November.
Mr Seguin does not share Mr Balladur's view that most of the current
scandals stem from the 1980s and can be dealt with by existing legislation,
notably the 1990 law on corporate contributions to political parties. The
fact that Mr Seguin also *something in here (HP) *
chairs a campaign committee for Mr Balladur's presidential rival, Mr Jacques
Chirac, does not incline him to minimise the damage to the government.
The detention of Mr Carignon marks a new threshold in the crackdown on
corruption. It is the first time a big-city mayor and ex-minister has been
locked up, even if briefly. Many Grenoble residents expressed shock at their
mayor ending up in a Lyons jail.
The Socialist opposition weighed in yesterday, claiming that with five of
ministers or former ministers under investigation the Balladur government
was 'in the process of coming apart'. But the edge of the attack by the
Socialists, themselves scarred from numerous scandals while in office, was
that the Balladur government had recently eased anti-corruption rules
requiring local councils to publish property deals and contract tenders, and
that the prime minister was indulging in a hypocritical 'media show'.
Mr Balladur is expected soon to have to replace his trade and industry
minister, Mr Gerard Longuet, who is expected to come under formal
investigation for financial and real estate improprieties. In July, Mr
Carignon left the government after being charged with 'receipt of fraud'.
The allegations linked Lyonnaise des Eaux's bail-out of a pro-Carignon
newspaper and the company's contract to run Grenoble's water supply.
The latest charge against Mr Carignon is that of 'passive corruption' -
receiving FFr13m (Pounds 1.55m) in corporate gifts, a free Paris apartment
and air tickets.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Want replaces war as Macedonia's key election issue: As
fears recede about the Bosnian conflict, economic problems loom large in the
minds of voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The political consensus that helped Macedonia emerge peacefully from the
wreckage of the former Yugoslavia shows signs of breaking apart in Sunday's
presidential and parliamentary elections.
According to opinion polls for the first direct presidential election, the
incumbent, Mr Kiro Gligorov - a reformist ex-Yugoslav politician elected by
parliament in 1990 who is given most of the credit for Macedonia's success
in winning international recognition - will easily defeat his nationalist
opponent, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, a theatre director with little experience
of politics.
The Alliance for Macedonia, the governing coalition led by the Social
Democrats, the re-named communists, and backed by President Gligorov, still
holds a lead in the polls for the parliamentary elections.
But a strengthening challenge from the free-market nationalist Democratic
party of Mr Petar Goshev, founded just over a year ago, makes it unlikely
that the coalition can capture a majority in the 120-seat parliament.
Sunday's election is not expected to produce a clear result, with candidates
in a only a few constituencies expected to win the overall majority
required. Most parliamentary seats will be decided in a run-off poll two
weeks later. As fears of the war in Bosnia spreading south recede,
Macedonia's economic problems start to loom larger in voters' minds. Mr
Goshev's election slogan, 'so ciste race' ('with clean hands'), underlines
the resentment felt at the way those close to the governing coalition appear
to be prospering.
Mr Goshev's call for an easing of taxes and faster privatisation through the
launch of a voucher system similar to those used elsewhere in eastern
Europe, holds a strong appeal for voters.
More than 40 per cent of Macedonia's workforce is unemployed or on forced
leave from factories that have shut down. Welfare benefits and pensions are
paid several months in arrears, and many families survive on remittances
from Macedonians working abroad.
Mr Alexander Tortevski, a lawyer in his 30s standing for the Democratic
party, says: 'We need to move through this transitional period much faster.
Other countries that had more tightly controlled economies under communism
are far ahead of us now.'
Macedonia's economy is squeezed between the UN embargo against Serbia, its
main trading partner, and a blockade imposed by Greece, in an effort to make
the republic change its name, considered in Athens to imply a claim on the
Greek province of Macedonia. The government estimates losses to the economy
caused by UN sanctions at about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn), while the
Greek embargo is said to cost another Dollars 60m monthly in lost exports
and higher transport costs.
Nevertheless, the coalition has pressed on with a stabilisation plan agreed
with the International Monetary Fund, although payment of a Dollars 35m
stand-by loan has been frozen until Macedonia reaches agreement with the
Paris Club on repaying Dollars 100m to creditors abroad.
The Democratic party hopes to make considerable gains at the expense of the
Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (VMRO), the hardline
nationalist party. Despite VMRO's efforts to revamp its image ahead of the
election, attempting to re-unite its half-dozen factions and present more
moderate candidates, voters believe the party is too closely linked with
Bulgaria, a traditional enemy of Macedonia.
However, the key to forming a new government could again be the ethnic
Albanian party, the Party for Democratic Prosperity, which has co-operated
with the Alliance for the past two years. Yet the PDP is also likely to lose
support on Sunday as members of a radical faction, impatient with the
coalition's reluctance to improve conditions for the Albanian minority in
Macedonia, have split away to run as independent candidates.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Currency collapse fuels fear of higher inflation in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine's volatile currency, the karbovanets, has fallen sharply in recent
days, losing 6 per cent of its value against dollar yesterday and 12 per
cent since Monday, raising fears of higher inflation this winter.
The karbovanets, also called the coupon, sold at 100,000 to the dollar on
the open market yesterday, a 50 per cent fall since September 12.
The currency's latest fall follows Ukraine's decision last Friday to abolish
the government's artificial exchange rate and reopen free currency auctions.
The move was the first step in a comprehensive economic reform programme
announced by President Leonid Kuchma earlier this week, but, thanks to
inflationary credits inherited from the previous administration, the initial
impact of reform has been further destabilisation.
Unlike the panic caused by the Russian rouble's sharp fluctuations,
Ukrainians this week remained nonplussed about the latest devaluations.
Public confidence in the karbovanets has never recovered from last year's
hyper-inflation - when the annual inflation rate exceeded 10,000 per cent -
and, although many purchases are made in karbovantsi, few Ukrainians hold
their savings in the national currency.
This autumn's devaluation stems largely from a massive credit release to
agriculture this summer. The credits, authorised by parliament, derailed the
Ukrainian central bank's tight monetary policy, which brought the inflation
rate down to single digits during the first half of the year.
As a result, commercial banks are releasing around Kbv5,000bn (Dollars
53.2m) onto the currency exchange market each week, according Mr Mykola
Melnychuk, a Ukrainian national bank official.
Economists expect inflation, up from 2.9 per cent for the month of August to
7.3 per cent for last month, to rise to 60 per cent for this month.
The rise in inflation does not necessarily threaten the reform effort
because the International Monetary Fund, set to approve a Dollars 360m loan
by October 31, anticipated the karbovanets' decline and a resulting price
hike.
However, the Russian rouble's dramatic turns this week do pose a threat to
Ukraine and other former Soviet neighbours.
Ukraine and Belarus, among others, would be hit hard if Russian exporters
compensated for the rouble's fall by raising prices. Many former Soviet
republics depend heavily on imports from Russia.
Mr Stanislav Bukovinsky, Ukraine's deputy finance minister, told Interfax
news agency yesterday that Russian price increases for oil, coal and nuclear
fuel might, like last year, push the country into hyperinflation. Half the
country's imports are for Russian energy supplies, although gas - the
largest purchase - is fixed at a low dollar rate.
Ironically, before the collapse of the rouble zone in 1992 Moscow's
reformers warned that other former Soviet republics where exporting
inflation to Russia and thereby jeopardising Russian economic reform.
Mr Bukovinsky said the rouble's impact on Ukraine simply underscores the
need for quick economic restructuring to lessen dependence on Russian energy
supplies.

FT  14 OCT 94 / SPD poised to tighten grip on upper house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No matter what happens in Sunday's election there will have to be a 'grand
coalition' between parliament's upper and lower houses. Even if the
governing coalition remains in power it will have to reach a new compromise
with the Bundesrat, the upper house which represents the 16 states and is
dominated by the opposition Social Democrats and Greens.
Moreover, the influence of the SPD is likely to increase after the Lander
elections in the eastern states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia
which also take place on Sunday. In western Germany, the SPD is expected to
comfortably win Saarland, headed by Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the party's
economics spokesman.
Both east German states are currently governed by the CDU in coalition with
the FDP. Opinion polls indicate that the FDP will fail to win 5 per cent of
the vote, the minimum required to enter the state parliaments, while the CDU
will not gain enough support to form a government on its own. In which case,
the CDU might be forced to form a grand coalition with the SPD.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, opinion polls give the SPD 31 per cent of the
vote, compared to the 27 per cent it won in 1990, while the CDU's vote
remains stable at 38 per cent. The Party of Democratic Socialism, successor
to the former east German communist party, could gain at least 17 per cent
of the vote; the Greens could retain their 6 per cent share.
There is some temptation among SPD officials in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to
form a government with the PDS, but this would not be tolerated by the
federal party organisation. 'Unless the Greens do very well, we could form a
grand coalition with the CDU,' an SPD official said.
The same possibility exists in Thuringia, where opinion polls show CDU's
share of the vote slipping from 45 per cent in 1990 to 41 per cent, while
the SPD's share has risen from 22 per cent to over 31 per cent. The Greens
might retain their 5 per cent. The PDS's share is expected to increase from
9 per cent to about 13 per cent.
A grand coalition in these two states would mean them sending CDU and SPD
representatives, instead of CDU and FDP ones. This would weaken the FDP's
influence in the Bundesrat while strengthening the SPD's. The 68 members of
the Bundesrat are not directly elected but chosen by the state governments.
Ten of the states are SPD-led, three are governed by the CDU, two have
CDU/SPD grand coalitions, while Bavaria is run by the Christian Social
Union, the CDU's sister party.
A stronger SDP hold on the Bundesrat could make life difficult for a CDU-led
coalition if it is returned to power.
In the last legislative period, 81 of the 504 laws approved by the Bundestag
were initially rejected by the Bundesrat. These were then passed to a
mediation committee consisting of members of both houses. Three laws were
rejected completely by the Bundesrat even after mediation.
Except for amendments to the constitution, which require a two-thirds
majority, a simple majority is required in the Bundesrat to block or accept
legislation approved by the Bundestag.
'Before we even debate draft laws in the Bundestag, it is crucial to sense
the mood in the Bundesrat,' a CDU deputy said, who spent three years trying
to reach a compromise on a compensation law for east property owners.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Parties zero in on Germany's pensioner vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Cornelia Moll has lived all her life in Mitte, the heart of east Berlin.
Born in 1924, she survived the wartime bombing, the Russian occupation, the
communist takeover, the building of the Berlin Wall, and unification. 'I
love the freedom,' said Mrs Moll. 'What I want for the future is security
for myself, my children, and my friends.'
Mrs Moll is one of the 16.6m pensioners whom Germany's political parties are
trying to woo in Sunday's federal election. And 'Sicher in die Zukunft' -
sure of the future - is the slogan that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing
Christian Democrats have adopted to attract them. 'The pensioners make up
over 30 per cent of the electorate. They could be one of the main deciding
factors,' said Mr Hans-Joachim Veen from the conservative Konrad Adenauer
Foundation.
Since 1949, the CDU has always succeeded in capturing the pensioner vote.
'The turnout is very high among this group,' said Mr Veen. 'No party can
afford to ignore them, unlike the younger generation who are very complacent
and indifferent about politics.'
In the 1990 federal elections, 81 per cent of pensioners voted compared to
64 per cent of 18 to 25 year olds. More than 51 per cent of the over-60s
voted CDU, 31 per cent for the opposition Social Democrats, and 13 per cent
of east Germans voted for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor
to east Germany's communist party.
But in this election, the CDU's traditional constituency is being challenged
by the SPD and PDS. 'We know we have always failed to win the vote of the
elderly and have failed to retain our voters when they reach pensionable
age,' said Ms Petra Machroth, an SPD official responsible for this group.
'However,' she added, 'in recent state elections we have noticed a shift in
voting patterns.' In the 1990 state election in Lower Saxony, and a year
later in Rheinland-Palatinate over 40 per cent of pensioners voted SPD.
'They swung the election for us,' said Ms Machroth. 'During this election
campaign, we have concentrated much more on the pensioners,' she said,
adding that 18 months ago the SPD set up a special unit, called Sixty Plus,
which is headed by Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the party's parliamentary leader.
But SPD officials admit they are running against the tide. The SPD has
131,000 pensioners, or 15 per cent of its total 860,400 membership - no
match for the CDU's 214,000, the equivalent of 33 per cent of its full
membership.
The PDS, however, is in a strong position to win over a percentage of the
pensioner vote in east Germany. In the federal 1990 elections, 46 per cent
of pensioners in east Germany voted for the CDU, 26 per cent for the SPD and
13 per cent for the PDS. But since then, the PDS has managed to attract the
over-60s into its ranks: 60 per cent of 130,000 strong membership are
pensioners; more than 30 per cent of the PDS voters belong to this age
group.
The CDU has tried to counter this influence by guaranteeing east Germans'
pensions at almost west German levels, and promoting itself as the party
which will fight crime, almost an unknown phenomenon for east Germans before
unification.
Despite such attempts, SPD and CDU officials agree that the east Germany's
3m pensioners, about 30 per cent of the region's electorate, are split
between the PDS and the CDU. 'It's all very well giving us good pensions.
But money is not everything. My son is unemployed. But there is something
else that upsets me. At my age, its not nice to be told by the CDU that the
past 40 years of life in eastern Germany were wasted and we have nothing to
show for it.'
In the 1990 election Mrs Moll said she voted for the PDS and the Greens. On
Sunday, she said Mr Kohl will not get her vote. 'My two votes will go to the
PDS. I know they can't guarantee my security. But my vote is a protest one
against Bonn, unemployment, and the arrogant way our past has been
dismissed.'

FT  14 OCT 94 / World markets rise as fears of increase in US rates diminish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, GEORGE GRAHAM and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World bond and equity markets forged ahead yesterday as subdued US inflation
figures raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would delay its next move to
increase short-term interest rates.
US producer prices for finished goods fell by 0.5 per cent in September,
thanks to a drop in energy prices. The core index, which excludes food and
energy, rose by just 0.1 per cent, less than the markets had expected.
Producer prices are regarded by private sector economists as an early
indicator of price pressures. But economists at the Federal Reserve, the
central bank, regard the measure, along with the consumer price index, which
is published today, as backward-looking. Still, the positive news on
producer price inflation encouraged a surge in buying of longer-dated US
Treasury bonds. By late in the day the price of the benchmark 30-year
government issue was more than half a point higher, with the yield slipping
to 7.847 per cent.
Early on, this week's rally in US share prices, which had stalled on
Wednesday, appeared to gain a new lease of life. Within minutes of the
opening of the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
surged by more than 50 points, triggering the market's restrictions on
program-guided buying for the second time this week.
By the close, however, the Dow was up just 14.80 at 3,889.95 as the
confidence of investors buckled in the final hour, ahead of economic data
due out today.
European markets were pulled up by Wall Street's early strength. In London,
the FT-SE 100 Index closed up 41.4 points at 3141.9, while UK government
bonds gained half a point. In Germany, the DAX index rose 1.7 per cent in
after-market trading and government bunds were up by around seven-eighths of
a point.
In previous weeks, world markets reacted negatively to US statistics
indicating strong economic growth, which led traders to fear that the Fed
would move quickly to raise rates to quell inflationary pressures. But last
Friday's weaker-than-expected US employment data have led to a change in
sentiment.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Clarke refuses to guarantee tax cuts before poll: Chancellor
dismisses suggestions of swing to right as 'laughable'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday refused to guarantee tax cuts
before the next general election.
He dismissed as 'laughable' suggestions that the Tory party should swing to
the right to counter Mr Tony Blair's more moderate Labour party.
Speaking after a cautious but well-received address to the Bournemouth party
conference, Mr Clarke indicated he would strongly resist efforts by
right-wing cabinet colleagues to dictate the government's policy towards
Europe.
With other cabinet ministers on the centre-left angry at attempts by
right-wingers to set the agenda, he said that Mr Michael Portillo, the
employment secretary, had been 'mistaken' in questioning the government's
commitment to Europe.
The chancellor said he had not changed any of his pro-European views and
remained in favour of the long-term goal of full economic and monetary union
 -an idea that is anathema to right-wing colleagues.
During a subdued debate on the economy in which he pledged that sustained
recovery would bring a strong upturn in the government's political fortunes,
Mr Clarke defused recent pressure from rightwing Tory MPs for tax cuts in
November.
He stressed that he was committed to a lower tax burden once public
borrowing had been brought under control. But he added later: 'Of course I
would be a happier man if it was this side of the election that I could make
the tax cuts. But I have no date circled in my calendar.'
Mr Clarke acknowledged that the strength of the economic recovery and the
sharp fall in inflation should allow him to cut several billions of pounds
in next month's Budget from his spending and borrowing targets. But he
insisted that the squeeze on spending would not be at the expense of
manifesto pledges to maintain the effectiveness of the welfare state. 'There
are areas of public spending where we are committed to growth.'
The chancellor added that the party should stick to the political ground on
which it now stood. 'The idea that the party starts marching off to the
right wing because Tony Blair is muscling in on it is slightly laughable.'
His comments came as cabinet ministers close to Mr John Major privately
voiced anger at the anti-European stance adopted by Mr Portillo and other
rightwing ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley and Mr John Redwood.
The ministers predicted Mr Major would use his closing speech to the
conference today to indicate that he would not allow the cabinet ministers
he once described as 'bastards' to dictate his strategy.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Peace is on everyone's lips in optimistic Belfast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was as if Christmas had arrived early in central Belfast yesterday.
'Peace at last' proclaimed the billboard outside the Belfast Telegraph on
the city's main thoroughfare in Royal Avenue.
For a community inured to 25 years of death and destruction and living apart
it was almost too good to be true.
While MPs and councillors assessed the political climate in the wake of the
ceasefire, shoppers, students and the business community were less concerned
with affairs of state.
One elderly woman summed up the general feeling. 'If they have all stopped
shooting for ever, that's good enough for me. I could not care less what
they do with their guns. They can hang them up at their fireplaces if they
like.'
The centre of Belfast has been a neutral zone where people have been able to
mingle freely without worrying about each other's religions.
Yesterday, talk of hopes for the future was on everyone's lips. No-one had
any time for the sceptics.
Yes, there was a long hard road of reconciliation ahead but for now the
silencing of gunfire was all that mattered.
At the Rock Bar in the Falls Road less than three weeks ago, loyalists left
a bomb outside the front door. Yesterday barman Patrick McCabe said: 'Maybe
we can get a bit of peace now.'
But the guard is not being dropped just yet. 'We will keep the security on
and see how it goes for a while.'
On the lower Shankill, a hardline Loyalist area which has endured its fair
share of heartache, one shopkeeper said: 'I hope it's over but I don't want
to get carried away. It will not be easy to forgive and forget but we must
start somewhere.'
At Castle Street, which leads into the staunchly republican Lower Falls
area, a young police officer was sharing a joke with a couple of youths. It
was hardly an earth shattering event but a significant gesture given
Ulster's grim past.
But for one woman October 13 will not be remembered as the day the peace
began but the day her husband died - while walking in the street.
Mrs Pauline Hegney cried when she heard when the ceasefire would start.
Three years ago last night her husband Karl, 33, was shot dead by the UVF in
Ormeau Road in south Belfast. 'He was just an innocent victim of sectarian
murder,' she said.

FT  14 OCT 94 / Loyalist pledge may speed talks: Ministers say Ulster
ceasefire could mean discussions with Sinn Fein by Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, JOHN MURRAY BROWN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday preparing the ground for early talks with
republican leaders, as the announcement of an open-ended loyalist ceasefire
improved the prospect of an end to sectarian violence in Ulster for the
first time in 25 years.
As Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech at the Tory
conference in Bournemouth to reassert the party's belief in the Union,
ministers acknowledged that talks with Sinn Fein could be under way by
Christmas.
'We don't want to drag our feet on this, we are not dawdling at all,' Sir
Patrick said, holding out the prospect that loyalist representatives could
also be brought into talks.
London is considering a scaled-down response to the IRA ceasefire amid
acknowledgement by senior ministers that it may never be given an
unequivocal pledge that the end to violence is for good.
The idea that the government should open a 'reversible' dialogue with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, will be considered by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, and cabinet colleagues next week.
Sir Patrick said the loyalist ceasefire made it 'that much harder for the
Provisionals to come back to violence and therefore it makes it a good deal
easier for us to come to a working assumption'.
The ceasefire gave a big push to the peace effort being carefully
orchestrated by the UK and Irish governments.
Mr Major said the announcement was 'unalloyed good news'. But he warned: 'We
must analyse it and consider it and then carefully decide with realism what
is the way forward.'
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, was less cautious, describing
the development as 'a wonderful moment'. He urged everyone to 'now work
together in a spirit of goodwill, reconciliation and forbearance to
consolidate a just and lasting peace - to ensure that all of the people of
Ireland are rid of the gun and the bomb from Irish politics for ever'.
He pressed Mr Major to take the opportunity of his conference speech today
to move the process forward. 'We are into the seventh week, and it is time
the whole pace of consolidating the peace process was accelerated,' he said.
In Bournemouth, Sir Patrick and Mr Major received a warm welcome from
conference representatives, in spite of the leadership's decision not to
allow a vote on whether the government should actively persuade Ulster's
people that their best future lay in the UK.
Yesterday's ceasefire move was announced at a press conference by the
Combined Loyalist Military Command, representing the two main outlawed
protestant paramilitary groups - the Ulster Defence Association and the
Ulster Volunteer Force.
The loyalists promised a cessation of 'all operational hostilities' from
midnight last night. 'The permanence of our ceasefire will be completely
dependent upon the continued cessation of all Nationalist and Republican
violence,' the statement said.
It also emerged that loyalist leaders had contact with the Irish government
prior to the ceasefire announcement.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Norwegians plan German gas pipe investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BREMEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norwegian oil and natural gas producers Statoil and Norsk Hydro yesterday
announced they would invest in a natural gas pipeline in Germany.
The agreement, signed with Germany's Ruhrgas, the biggest German gas
importer, and BEB, Germany's biggest producer of gas, establishes a new
company, Netra. Netra will complete and operate a large-diameter pipeline
requiring a total investment of more than DM1bn (Dollars 650m).
The agreement comes just two weeks after completion of a competitive
pipeline transmission system, jointly owned by Gasprom of Russia and
Wintershall of Germany, and intensifies the battle between Norway and Russia
over new European gas supplies.
Netra will build a 290km pipeline between Etzel, near Wilhelmshaven in
Germany, and Salzwedel on Germany's former east-west border. The Etzel
facility is supplied via Emden, Germany, from the natural gas fields in the
Norwegian North Sea.
It will link up with the gas pipeline from Salzwedel to Bernau, north of
Berlin, being built by Ruhrgas and Verbundnetz (VNG) and will be connected
to the VNG pipeline network as well, allowing it to be used for Norwegian
gas volumes contracted by VNG in 1993.
Between 70 per cent and 75 per cent of the Netra pipeline has already been
built by the German partners. The Norwegian partners will therefore be
making the greatest share of the remaining investment.
Under the terms of the deal, Statoil and Norsk Hydro will jointly own 25 per
cent of Netra with an option to increase this to a third should the pipeline
system be extended.
The remaining Netra shares are equally distributed between the German
partners in the venture. Dr Burkhard Bergman, a Ruhrgas executive, yesterday
said the Netra pipeline was 'not a common carrier but it's an investment for
the shareholders,' referring to the European Union's plans to open pipelines
to third party users.
The companies said their co-operation would increase natural gas supply
volumes from Norway to Germany and central Europe. Another aim of the
venture is to cut unit costs of the pipeline which will be completed in
1995.
Netra believes the pipeline will be an important link in the growing
European gas grid integrating the gas industries of western, central and
eastern Europe by a cross-border pipeline network. The pipeline - with
annual transport capacity of up to 18bn cubic metres - will have the
potential to supply Germany and neighbouring countries with volumes of
Norwegian gas greater than those already contracted.
Existing contracts with Germany alone call for the annual volume of
Norwegian gas imports to climb from 11bn cubic metres at present to over
30bn cubic metres in 2005, raising the share of Norwegian gas to 31 per cent
of German supplies, from 14 per cent.

Oliveira said yesterday. He added that there was potential for exports of
railway carriages, electricity generating equipment, electrical and
telecommunications cables and digital telephone exchanges. The minister also
said China had expressed interest in building a toy factory in Portugal to
get round European Union import quotas on Chinese toys. Portugal runs a
heavy trade deficit with China, to which it has traditionally exported
modest quantities of tomato paste and wood pulp.

FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas was the most heavily traded stock in the FT-SE 100 Index and the
second most active stock option as a big two-way pull developed in the
shares. They underperformed the market, closing only a fraction higher at
302 1/2 p on volume of 16m; turnover in the traded options totalled the
equivalent of a further 3.3m shares.
Specialists said the market had begun to reappraise British Gas's recent
statements on dividend strategy after a lunch held on Tuesday between Gas
and a number of leading analysts. The majority of analysts increased their
dividend forecasts for Gas following the big strategy presentation held in
London at the end of September. A number of favourable regulatory decisions
have enabled Gas to outperform the market by 13 per cent since June.
Burmah Castrol jumped 16 to 855p ahead of the trip by analysts to the
group's lubricants operations in Thailand and Vietnam at the end of the
month.
Barclays was restrained by news that Kleinwort Benson had taken the shares
off its buy list, downgrading the stock to a hold. The stock price edged up
only a penny to 563p. National Westminster dipped 5 1/2 to 497p ahead of
figures expected today from US subsdiary NatWest Bancorp.
HSBC raced up 16 to 726p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to have been an
aggressive buyer of the stock. Insurance brokers made further rapid progress
after broker buy notes and talk of potential bid moves. Willis Corroon added
4 1/2 at 165 1/2 p and Lloyd Thompson 15 at 176p.
Drinks group Matthew Clark tumbled 36 to 589p after it announced a Pounds
109m acquisition of rival Gaymer Group, and a Pounds 64.6m rights issue to
help fund the deal. However, market watchers welcomed the deal.
A clutch of brokers' recommendations supported Unilever, the shares closing
8 ahead at 1130p. The prospect of increased competition in the snack foods
business, together with unconfirmed rumours of a negative broker's note,
left shares in United Biscuits 3 lighter at 309p.
Storehouse improved 6 to 208p, boosted by a profits upgrade and
recommendation from UBS. The securities house raised its current year
profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 90m and said: 'Trading seems to have
gathered pace at Storehouse in the last couple of months.'
High street retailer Lloyds Chemists forged ahead 16 to 299p after posting a
sparkling set of full-year figures which revealed a 17 per cent increase in
profits to Pounds 58.3m, and a 31 per cent rise in the dividend.
The favourable sentiment in Lloyds Chemists spread to Boots, which climbed
13 to 525p. UBS reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, pointing to
good prospects for the healthcare market.
Overnight selling in the US on Tuesday hit ICI, whose shares closed 2 lower
yesterday at 814p.
Amersham international surged a further 52 to 995p on consideration of the
company's Japanese deal announced earlier in the week.
Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper maker, slipped 4 to 258p on disappointment
that it had failed to secure a portion of SD Warren, one of the dominant US
players in the sector. Warren was snapped up by Sappi, of South Africa, for
Dollars 1.6bn.

FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT easier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was one of the few weak
spots as one house apparently discovered that the cost to the company of
this year's Los Angeles earthquake was far greater than previously expected.
UBS spoke to Farmers, the BAT subsidiary which is one of the largest
insurance groups in the US, and established that claims resulting from the
earthquake had rocketed to Dollars 150bn from Dollars 120bn, thus draining
the capital available for writing new business.
The securities house has had the stock as a trading buy for the past couple
of months. However, the latest news has prompted consideration of a return
to its fundamentally bearish stance. There is also concern that BAT will
have to carry out huge capital investment in order to cope with the
potential demand for cigarettes in newly opened markets such as Eastern
Europe. The worries were voiced at the UBS afternoon meeting and the stock
hit 443p before rallying with the market to close 2 off at 448p.

The telecoms area attracted the most concentrated activity in the market,

totalling 37m shares.
There was also keen support for the two classes of Securicor stock and
Security Services. Securicor/Security Services hold a 40 per cent stake in
Cellnet, the cellular phones group in which BT has a 60 per cent
shareholding.
Dealers said the sector had been boosted by recent speculation of a demerger
of Cable and Wireless's Mercury telecommunications business, which includes
its highly successful One-2-One digital cellular phones business.
Any demerger of Mercury is expected to attract strong demand in the stock
market and could trigger a rerating of the other cellular companies. It was
also said that BT might launch a pre-emptive strike to acquire the Securicor
minority holding in Cellnet in the event of a Mercury demerger.
C&amp;W, also helped by the expansion of HK Telecom in China, rose 6 to 421p,
while BT settled a penny higher at 396 1/2 p. News of a joint venture in
France with Generale des Eaux and Southwestern Bell helped to drive Vodafone
12 1/2 ahead to 217p. Securicor ordinary rose 18 to 1463p, the 'A' stock 36
to 936p and Security Services 35 to 780p.

FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL up on BAe bid move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace raced ahead following the announcement of the long awaited
agreed bid for submarine maker VSEL, with analysts taking a favourable view
of the trading, balance sheet and fiscal implications of the proposed
takeover.
The stock advanced throughout the day in heavy volume to close 12 higher at
471p on a turnover of 12m shares. VSEL finished at 1310p, up 85 on the day
and 15 above the notional value of the share exchange portion of the offer.
Analysts felt that the takeover was Defence Ministry driven. By yesterday
afternoon, speculation on the possibility of a potential counter-bid had
begun to flag, although in some quarters GEC was still being promoted as the
most likely potential rival to British Aerospace.
If it goes ahead, the deal stands to widen BAe's defence capability and
bolster its balance sheet. VSEL brings in net cash of Pounds 288m plus tax
benefits that allow profits to roar through to BAe effect-ively tax free in
both 1995 and 1996.

FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead for the fifth day running but trading was at
times unsure of direction and the market closed short of its best levels,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract ended the day 12 points higher at 3,114,
having touched 3,127 in mid-
afternoon. The cash market premium was 13.5 points with the fair value
premium standing at around 15 points.
Trading was fitful, moving in bursts in both directions. There was a bit
less activity than on Tuesday but trading volume ran to 13,702 contracts,
down from 14,793.
Both locals and market makers were equally active, and traders said there
were even occasional flashes of institutional business, although much of
this was said to be the unwinding of short positions.
The premium to the cash market fluctuated widely, moving out at times to 30
points. Traders said some arbitrage business was undertaken, notably by
NatWest Securities.
Traded options were also active with volume rising to 48,750 lots from
43,990 in the preceding session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for
19,900 lots.
HSBC were the busiest individual stock options with 3,824 lots dealt.
British Gas traded 3,329 lots. Kingfisher and NatWest Bank were also active.

FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Further gains follow favourable
inflation data - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Better statistics than expected on domestic inflation, backed up by
favourable comments from the Governor of the Bank of England, brought
further gains in UK shares yesterday. The confident tone of the market was
set early by the strong rise overnight on Wall Street and by an agreed bid
of Pounds 478.5m from British Aerospace for VSEL, the UK nuclear submarine
manufacturer.
Boosted by further strength in stock index futures and government bonds, the
FT-SE 100-share Index broke through 3,100 within the first hour of full
trading. But the market, although busy, spent the rest of the session
jousting with this level, closing a shade under the day's best at 3,100.5
for a net gain of 27.5.
The UK stock market has now risen for five successive trading sessions,
showing a rise of nearly 5 per cent since the middle of last week. The
recovery since the beginning of the final quarter of the year has
restimulated confidence that UK equities can move towards the Footsie 3,500
area before the end of December. Excellent trading results this week from
leading US companies have highlighted the recovery in global economies.
Some traders believed that the market was slowing down at last night's
close, as Wall Street shaded off by 3 Dow points in early trading and global
markets awaited the US producer price index, due today, and US industrial
production and utility capacity utilisation statistics, due on Friday.
'I would expect some kind of consolidation at these levels,' said Mr Ian
Harnett at Strauss Turnbull. 'The Footsie's close above 3,100 will be
regarded as important.'
The announcement of a further dip in both the headline and underlying rates
of domestic retail price inflation in September, together with a steady
trend in average earnings, strengthened market hopes that base rates can be
left unchanged for the rest of the year, thus easing one of the principal
concerns felt by investors towards UK equities.
Faith in the low inflation outlook was further encouraged when Mr Eddie
George, Governor of the Bank of England, was reported from the US as saying
that markets were exaggerating the extent of expected inflationary pressure.
The market assumed that the British Aerospace bid for VSEL had been well
cleared with all official parties before announcement, and could be safely
regarded as a 'done deal'. A sharp gain in GEC shares indicated the stock
market's belief that it was unlikely to contest the bid. However, the share
price of VSEL, now effectively related to the BAe stock price, which was
also strong yesterday, edged above the share exchange offer terms.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index advanced 28.4 to 3,535.3, keeping pace with the blue
chip market and suggesting that interest in the second line issues might be
returning. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of the day's Seaq
total of 732.4m shares, a welcome improvement from the 662.3m of the
previous session.
The strong advance in the Footsie index was again achieved without much
contribution from the leading oil issues, which have so far refused to be
over-excited by the developments on the Kuwait border. Dollar stocks in
general remained very firm, although the pace slackened when Wall Street
opened the new session on the downside. Short term trends in London are
expected to depend on the performance of the New York market over the next
two sessions.
The insurance sector continued to make progress and the banking and retail
areas drew confidence from the calming of interest rate worries. The
improved tone on Wall Street and in the UK and continental European
securities markets was reflected in a gain in shares of Reuters, the global
financial information group.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The bolsa closed sharply higher on investor optimism about third-quarter
results and bottom-fishing for stocks whose prices have fallen in recent
weeks. The IPC index moved ahead 75.23, or 2.82 per cent, to 2,740.82 in
strong volume of 105.6m shares.
Analysts said investors believe Mexican companies will report healthy
third-quarter earnings and that the market's decline following the September
28 assassination of a top ruling party official had made a number of stocks
very attractive.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profits taken ahead of
economic figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A three-session rally by US stocks stalled yesterday ahead of a barrage of
crucial economic data due out today and tomorrow, writes Frank McGurty in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.68 off at 3,875.15 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.32 to 465.47. Declines outscored advances by a slim
margin after volume of 270.3m shares.
Other indices were slightly ahead, with the Nasdaq composite up 1.43 at
767.00 and the American SE composite adding a scant 0.74 at 458.50.
In the absence of fresh economic news and a light flow of corporate results,
stocks opened weaker. Profit-takers were taking advantage of share prices
inflated by a 101-point advance by the Dow since last Thursday's close.
The slight downturn also reflected a modest setback in the bond market.
Investors in both markets were keen to see today's data in September
producer prices and tomorrow's news on consumer price inflation, retail
sales and industrial production.
Caution prevailed, though the outlook was generally favourable. None of the
data was expected to be particularly troublesome and there was a growing
consensus that the Federal Reserve would hold off on any further moves to
lift interest rates until next month.
Amid such underlying optimism, stocks retraced their steps as the morning
progressed and nudged briefly into positive territory late in the afternoon.
General Electric, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 50 1/8 , and United
Technologies, Dollars 1 1/4 ahead at Dollars 64, aided the cause. But there
was little conviction behind the move upwards, and the index had receded by
the close.
While there were fewer companies announcing their results, several were
giving Wall Street good indication about what was to come.
Goodyear Tire, riding high on the strong demand for US cars, said it
expected to report improved quarterly earnings. But its estimate failed to
impress investors. The stock edged up Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 .
Farah, an apparel maker, was hammered after forecasting earnings of 15 to 25
cents a share in the three months to November 4, against 42 cents a year
earlier. The stock plunged Dollars 2, or 19 per cent, to Dollars 8 5/8 .
Among companies actually reporting, Weyerhauser became the second paper and
pulp supplier after International Paper to post disappointing results. The
stock fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 . CBS shares lost about 2.7 per
cent of their value after the media group revealed a decline in net income
and revenue. The issue shed Dollars 9 to Dollars 330.
In the technology group, International Business Machines stood out after a
quiet outing in the previous session, when many of its competitors had
appreciated in value. Big Blue rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 73 on
favourable comments by Mr Louis Gerstner, its chairman.
Advanced Micro Devices was marked down Dollars 1 3/8 to 23 3/8 after a
federal court ruled against the company in a lawsuit relating to microchip
coding. On the Nasdaq, Intel, which filed the suit, dipped Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 59 3/4 .
Elsewhere, computer-related issues were mixed. But Apple, frequently
mentioned as a possible strategic partner with IBM, gained Dollars 2 1/2 at
Dollars 42 1/8.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue chip Canadian stocks led a strong rally in Toronto, fuelled by
expectations of strong third-quarter earnings on both sides of the border.
Big name companies such as Alcan, Magna, Methanex and Newbridge Networks all
posted solid gains. Analysts said growing confidence in the US over earnings
prospects has been buoying the markets there, and the spillover is helping
Canadian markets.
Investors will be watching for today's US September producer prices and
tomorrow's consumer prices to get a reading on the strength of the US
economy and an inkling of where interest rates are headed.
The TSE 300 index finished 39.6 ahead at 4,355.0 after reaching 4,363.4, and
rises led falls by 435 to 348 after volume of 65.4m shares.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Portugal attracts interest from brokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal has been attracting interest from brokers, some of whom rate it as
a buy above both Greece and Turkey, writes John Pitt.
So far this year the Portuguese equity market has gained 8 per cent in
dollar terms, compared with a loss of 44 per cent in Turkey and a 1 per cent
rise in Greece, and has been the best performer in the Europe/Middle East
sub-index.
Lehman Brothers argues that Portugal is attractive because, politically, it
is relatively stable and has the expectation for higher real growth than
either Greece or Turkey. Merrill Lynch expects the market to move in line
with the European average over the next 12 months, with the momentum coming
from the likelihood of growth in the economy, which could appreciate faster
than the rest of the Continent.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Golds help S Africa to recoup losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg recovered part of Tuesday's hefty losses as the market found
support from firmer world equities and a mild bullion price recovery.
However, dealers said that sentiment remained nervous as the gold price was
unconvincing and the financial rand continued to pressure rand prices of
shares. The overall index advanced 34 to 5,583, golds put on 17 at 2,282 and
industrials moved ahead 16 to 6,261.
Lehman Brothers has added South African equities, particularly gold miners,
to its model portfolio with a 2 per cent weight, taking funds from France
and Switzerland.
In yesterday's trading, De Beers added R1.75 at R99.75, Anglos rose R4 to
R231 and Gencor picked up 50 cents to R14.30 after Tuesday's sharp losses.
SAB moved ahead R1.75 to R85.75 and Sasol firmed 10 cents to R35.75.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Activity muted as investors
await data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity remained muted yesterday on the Continent ahead of the release of
US data later this week, writes Our Markets Staff.
In its latest European strategy report JP Morgan says there is little sign
of short-term relief for the region's equity markets because of the
uncertainty surrounding a further rise in US interest rates. However, the
broker says, the medium-term outlook for the core countries of France and
Germany is positive, because of 'robust growth and low inflation'.
By contrast, Spain and Italy, while likely to experience even stronger
growth, might be affected by higher inflation and higher short-term interest
rates, leading to an underweight recommendation.
FRANKFURT rose during official hours but then fell back slightly in late
trading, but the day was marked by a general lack of interest ahead of this
weekend's elections. The Dax index put on 6.51 to 2,077.57, then fell to
2,069.98 later.
Schering added DM21 to DM959, adding to Tuesday's gain which followed news
of the presentation of a rival multiple sclerosis drug.
Elsewhere BASF put on DM3.1 to DM313 and Bayer DM5.1 to DM356.
Financials were pulled in both directions: Deutsche Bank fell DM2.8 to
DM712.2, Dresdner Bank DM1 to DM389, while Allianz rose DM14 to DM2,277 and
Commerzbank DM2 to DM320.
PARIS featured individual stories as the CAC-40 index drifted in a listless
fashion, ending down a marginal 0.88 at 1,918.14. Turnover was FFr3bn.
UAP was among the worst performers, off 5 per cent at FFr138.50, after
reporting a fall in first-half profit to FFr853m, below most analysts'
expectations.
Carrefour went in the opposite direction, rising FFr46 to FFr2,184, denying
reports that it might make a bid for a UK supermarket group. Sanofi picked
up a further FFr11.10 to FFr252.30 after announcing the sale of part of its
bio-activities division on Tuesday.
ZURICH was lower in quiet conditions, with trading dominated by
professionals. The SMI index closed 7.5 down at 2,562.7.
Ciba registered shares eased SFr4 to SFr716. The company's announcement of a
3 per cent decline in nine-month sales proved in line with expectations,
although the negative impact of the strong Swiss franc was slightly worse
than expected. Roche, reporting third-quarter figures on Monday, saw its
certificates finish flat at SFr5,880.
UBS shares showed little reaction to comments by Mr Martin Ebner, chairman
of BZ Bank, that he was not trying to gain control. The UBS bearers picked
up SFr2 to SFr1,240, and the registered stock was unchanged at SFr300.
However, Mr Ebner's BK Vision fell SFr40 to SFr1,400.
Brown Boveri bearers continued their comeback, picking up another SFr11 to
SFr1,111 in heavy trade, after their period in the doldrums. Other cyclicals
were also higher, Fischer adding SFr10 to SFr1,555, and Sulzer rising SFr6
to SFr891.
Second-line insurers saw continued demand, with Berner rising SFr90 to
SFr1,490 on continued speculation that Allianz, which holds a 30 per cent
stake, might be planning to expand its share. Baloise added SFr45 to
SFr2,845, but Elvia eased SFr20 to SFr3,600.
AMSTERDAM was unable to maintain the gains of the previous two days and the
AEX index was left trailing 1.81 at 402.30.
VNU, which denied reports that its television interests would be affected by
new competition in the sector, dipped Fl 3.20 to Fl 176.80. Fokker, the
aircraft manufacturer, slipped 20 cents to Fl 15.10 after reports that
Cityline, a division of Lufthansa of Germany, might replace the F-50s in its
fleet.
MILAN made an early attempt to rally, but the momentum was soon lost as
technical, month-end deadlines, and simmering political worries once again
made their presence felt. The Comit index finished 2.85 ahead at 639.68.
Some blue chips managed to hold on to gains. Benetton, still recovering from
last week's sharp losses, rose L59 to L19,935, and Cir was L21 ahead at
L1,858.
Demand was also noted for the Fiat motor components maker, Magneti Marelli,
ahead of its merger with Gilardini. Magneti gained L44 to L1,292.
Falls were seen, however, among the telecommunications companies, with Stet
losing L40 to L4,479 and Telecom Italia giving up L64 to L4,143.
STOCKHOLM featured a further strong gain in Ericsson, the B shares rising
SKr2.50 to SKr417.50, after good results from Motorola in the US. However,
most investors were awaiting the country's inflation data due out today.
The Affarsvarlden general index rose 10.20 to 1,425.20.
HELSINKI was stronger on expectations that Sunday's referendum will result
in a yes vote for EU membership. The HEX index was up 35.32 at 1,899.04.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 1.4% to end
above 20,000 level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by arbitrageurs and overseas investors lifted prices, and the Nikkei
225 average gained for the third consecutive day, rising above the 20,000
level for the first time in a month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index advanced 268.26, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,089.72 after a day's low
of 19,846.77 and high of 20,115.22. Arbitrage buying and purchases of blue
chip shares by foreigners countered selling by financial institutions and
investment trusts.
Volume totalled 280m shares, against 199.3m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 16.76, or 1.1 per cent, to 1,600.60 and the Nikkei 300
added 2.96, or 1 per cent, at 293.22. Advances led declines by 812 to 193,
with 159 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 1.80
to 1,319.96.
'Improving economics, the currency movement and the approach of the final
leg of the Japan Tobacco fiasco is encouraging investors,' said Mr Tom Hill,
strategist at SG Warburg.
He added that although around 70 per cent of prospective buyers in Japan
Tobacco were expected to have given up their purchase rights, this reflected
the inadequacy of the new issues system and not the stock market's current
level.
Traders also said fears of over-supply from the JT listing had been
alleviated by reports that the Ministry of Finance would refrain from
offering unsold shares from the second round of subscriptions on the market
at the time of the stock listing.
Japan Telecom, the telecommunications operator, rose Y100,000 to Y3.99m,
while DDI moved up Y45,000 to Y933,000, recovering the Y900,000 mark for the
first time in a month.
Mitsubishi Bank, which will be taking a majority stake in Nippon Trust Bank,
a financially troubled trust bank, climbed Y70 to Y2,620.
Overseas investors bought chemical and steel shares. NKK, the most active
issue of the day, firmed Y3 to Y290, while Mitsubishi Chemical gained Y18 at
Y567.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 171.15 to 22,286.19 in volume of 17.2m
shares.
Roundup
Strength overnight on Wall Street helped many of the region's markets to
advance.
TAIPEI ended sharply higher on hopes that the government would take action
to prevent a further fall in the market, which has been rocked by default
payments over the past week. The weighted index rallied 371.07, or 6 per
cent, to 6,495.78 in TDollars 87.66bn turnover.
Hualon was the most active issue and rose by the daily permitted 7 per cent
limit to TDollars 19.90, but Taiwan Tea, a subsidiary, fell TDollars 2.50 to
TDollars 63.
HONG KONG finished 1.8 per cent up but off the day's highs following a late
surge in afternoon trade on buying of China-related stocks and Hong Kong
Telecom on expectations that the group would announce a China venture along
with Cable and Wireless later in the day.
The Hang Seng index added 170.03 at 9,532.35 after an intraday peak of
9,549.22. Hongkong Telecom put on 85 cents, or 5.5 per cent, at HKDollars
16.25. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong rose 61.95,
or 4.7 per cent, to 1,380.80.
In the opposite direction, Ming Pao, publisher of one of Hong Kong's best
read upmarket newspapers, fell 5.5 per cent after a two-day suspension
prompted by revelations that Mr Yu Pun-hoi, the chairman, had a criminal
record. The stock lost 30 cents at HKDollars 5.20, after HKDollars 5.
SEOUL finished at a second consecutive record high as blue chips rebounded
strongly, overcoming selective profit-taking. The composite index rose 11.00
to 1,089.66, responding to comments by the finance minister that rules for
foreigners' stock investment would be eased from next year.
SINGAPORE extended Tuesday's rebound as investors were cheered by Wall
Street's sharp rise and receding fears of a Gulf war. The Straits Times
Industrial index moved forward 23.08 to 2,368.31. KUALA LUMPUR continued to
rally on technical buying, fuelled by the overnight Wall Street surge, and
the composite index improved 8.71 to 1,137.00.
However, volume was limited, with investors cautiously awaiting the outcome
of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) supreme council
meeting late in the day where the recent clash between the prime minister
and an UMNO youth leader was expected to be discussed.
MANILA was supported by a late round of bargain hunting on expectations of
strong corporate earnings in the third quarter. The composite index gained
23.51 at 2,970.46.
SYDNEY drifted lower, showing little response to the overnight Wall Street
rise. The All Ordinaries index eased 1.0 to 2,002.6 in turnover of ADollars
408.7m.
WELLINGTON was led higher by Telecom, up 12 cents at NZDollars 5.35, and
leading forestry stocks which were helped by a strong US lumber futures
market. The NZSE-40 capital index rose 31 to 2,056.80.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Markets Report: UK interest rate prospects improve further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent turnround in UK interest rate expectations continued yesterday on
the back of good inflation figures and bullish comments from Mr Eddie
George, governor of the Bank of England, writes Philip Gawith.
The December short sterling contract closed at 93.55 yesterday, 40 basis
points higher than the beginning of last week, while the March contract was
55 basis points up at 92.79.
The dollar slipped below Y100 again to finish at Y99.885 from Y100.325.
Against the D-Mark it ended at DM1.5421 from DM1.5466. In New York it closed
at Y99.75 and DM1.5407.
The Russian rouble staged a recovery on the exchanges, rising by 5.1 per
cent to Rs3,736 per dollar, from Rs3,926, after plunging 33 per cent from
the start of the month.
The Scandinavian currencies were weaker, with an opinion poll suggesting
that Swedish voters might reject membership of the European Union dragging
down the krona and taking the Finnish markka with it.
The D-Mark was generally firmer all round, while sterling lost some ground,
with the trade weighted index closing at 79.9 from 80.1.
The catalyst for the improvement in short sterling was data showing annual
retail inflation in September at 2.2 per cent, down from 2.4 per cent in
August. Mr George later cheered the market further when he said: 'It would
be extraordinary if we had strong acceleration of inflation with such slow
money growth (in the larger economies).'
Sentiment remains bearish; the market is discounting three-month money at
6.45 per cent by Christmas, compared to 5 7/8 per cent currently. The same
point emerges from looking at the options strike prices for the December
contract, which shows most of the open interest contracts are found at
93.50, 93.75 and 94.00. This shows that most investors expect three-month
rates to be in the 6 to 6.5 per cent range at the end of the year.
Most economists are less pessimistic in their outlook than the market, with
many holding to the view that there will be no further increase in interest
rates this year. This is based on the assumption that the economy has slowed
quite sharply in the third quarter.
In spite of the market's lingering bearishness, the turnround over the past
10 days has been considerable. Analysts attributed this large move to the
fact that the market was correcting itself from a very oversold position.
The speed and extent of the correction has been such, however, that there
are already concerns that the market might be approaching overbought levels.
The same is not necessarily so for sterling. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief
economist in London at Bank of America, comments: 'In the longer term it has
to be good for sterling if the UK emerges as a low inflation economy.'
The dollar's dip to a low of Y99.65 was prompted by the receding prospect of
the dollar receiving safe haven support from conflict in the Gulf.
Other factors contributing to its weakness were talk of dollar sales from Mr
George Soros's Quantum fund, and possible selling interest from Kampo, the
Japanese postal life insurance bureau.
Comments from Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, that Japanese
lending rates could be expected to rise, also helped the yen.
A further threat to the dollar comes from Germany. The D-Mark has been
fairly weak for the past month on fears that Chancellor Kohl's coalition
might not be returned with a working majority. Should he win this weekend's
election, however, the D-Mark is likely to benefit, and the dollar will
suffer.
On the other hand, some observers believe the dollar may benefit from Mr
Clinton's decisive action in the Gulf. They reason that this could help the
Democrats in next month's mid-term congressional elections.
If this helped them maintain control of the Senate, the possibility of a
stalemate between the legislature and the executive would be avoided. This,
the argument goes, would make dollar assets, and hence the dollar, more
attractive.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 1.124bn assistance, Pounds 474m at
established rates, to UK money markets, compared to a Pounds 1.1bn shortage.
Overnight money traded between 5 and 6 3/4 per cent.
German call money was steady at 4.90/5 per cent ahead of today's Bundesbank
council meeting. No shift in official rates is expected.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US maize estimate increased
again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The size of this year's US prospective feedgrains harvest grew again
yesterday, with the US Department of Agriculture now saying that the maize
crop will be 9.6bn bushels, higher than trade estimates of 9.5bn, and 345m
bushels more than the agency's own forecast a month ago.
The government's estimate for soyabean production also rose, to 2.45bn
bushels, from last month's 2.3bn. The report normally would have prompted a
steep plunge in grain prices at the Chicago Board of Trade. However, grain
futures markets were steady to slightly higher yesterday morning as traders
concentrated instead on the USDA's forecasts for much bigger export sales of
grain.
'The USDA finally has some breathing room,' said Mr. Joe Victor, a grain
analyst with Allendale, Inc. 'Last year we had prices up, but nothing to
sell. This year, we've got a big crop and the USDA is saying we're going to
export more of it.'
The agency estimated yesterday that the US would sell 1.625bn bushels of
maize overseas this crop year, and would export 740m bushels of soyabeans.
On Monday, the USDA said that 44 per cent of the US soyabean harvest had
been completed, and 27 per cent of the maize crop was in. Farmers said that
despite ideal conditions, the large crop would take longer than usual to
harvest.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norske Skog to increase
newsprint prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norske Skog, the Norwegian papermaker, announced yesterday it would increase
newsprint prices in the UK market by 15 per cent from the beginning of next
year, writes Deborah Hargreaves. The company which has a 10 per cent share
of the British newsprint market, said the increase was the minimum it could
ask for to cover sharply higher raw materials costs.
Many newsprint mills are seeking to raise prices from the beginning of
October, which is likely to lead to increases in general of 7 to 8 per cent
this year. But the market could be pushed higher when annual negotiations
with newspaper publishers open towards the end of the year, when mills will
be looking to pass on costs which have doubled and even trebled this year.
Prices in continental Europe and North America are also set to increase as
rebates are eliminated in a more buoyant economic climate. Newsprint prices
could rise by as much as 30 per cent in the US market.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Oil futures fall for second day as
fears of Gulf conflict recede - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL prices fell for the second consecutive day as chances of conflict on the
Kuwait-Iraq border appeared to recede, traders at London's International
Petroleum Exchange said.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices turned higher in the afternoon,
lifting other base metals. A firmer overnight trend in the New York market
was cited as the main reason for copper's renewed strength.
London COFFEE futures were mostly higher at the close after a session marked
by volatile price swings.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Magma to go ahead with Nevada
gold/copper mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nevada is to have another copper-gold mine. Magma Copper, the Tucson-based
group, yesterday gave the go-ahead for its USDollars 300m Robinson mine near
Ely in the middle of the State.
Robinson is scheduled to start up in January, 1996, and will produce 135m lb
(61,252 tonnes) a year of copper, 110,000 troy ounces of gold and 325,000
troy ounces of silver for 16 years, said Mr Burgess Winter, Magma's
president. Life-of-mine cash operating costs would be 50 cents a pound
(Dollars 1,102 a tonne) but only 46 cents (Dollars 1,014) in the early
years.
Only a week ago Magma, with a bid of about USDollars 250m, won the
closely-contested auction for Tintaya, Peru's second-largest copper mine,
which was sold by the government as part of its privatisation process.
Mr Winter said at a meeting in London with the Association of Mining
Analysts that the combination of Tintaya and Robinson made achievable
Magma's target of producing 750m lb of copper a year at a cost below 50
cents a pound by the end of 1996 and gave it a good base for its long-term
objective of producing 1bn lb at below 50 cents by the year 2000.
Robinson was until the late 1970s mined by Kennecott, the US company now
part of RTZ, but was closed down because of high costs and the need for
substantial capital investment. Kennecott sold the entire area to Alta Gold,
a 'junior' company. for Dollars 20m after a court dispute and Magma paid
Dollars 58m to take it over gradually from Alta.
Mr Winter said the mine needed a new tailings (waste) dam and concentrator
plant. The three existing open pits had substantial reserves around them -
252m tonnes containing 2.1bn lb of recoverable copper and 1.8m ounces of
gold - and there was considerable potential to increase these reserves.
Magma had hoped to bring Robinson into production in late 1994 but was
delayed by an environmental impact statement by the Nevada Bureau of Land
Management. The Bureau approved the operating plan on September 9 and the
30-day appeal period expired this week.
The copper market might face some years of oversupply before the end of the
decade, warned Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, Chile's state-owned
group. He pointed out that Chile's copper production was expected to nearly
double from 2.2m tonnes to about 4m tonnes by the year 2000.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Investment plans dim paper
hopes - Capacity boosts may stall recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The disclosure last week that two of Sweden's big pulp and paper groups are
planning significant new capacity investments sent shivers through a market
that is just getting used to the idea that the good times are back.
Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper company, said it was starting design
work on a new 290,000-tonnes-a-year board machine - an investment that would
cost around SKr2.8bn (Pounds 240m). MoDo, meanwhile, is expected to confirm
next month that it will go ahead with the construction of a SKr2.1bn
newsprint machine, with a capacity of 270,000 tonnes, at its Braviken plant.
These are by some margin the biggest investments to be announced by Swedish
forestry groups this year. But the news did not go down well with the market
where memories of the severe downturn in the forestry cycle between 1991 and
1993 are still painfully fresh.
'Last time it was not lack of demand that drove operating rates down - it
was excess capacity,' says Mr Mads Asprem, forestry analyst with Morgan
Stanley in London. He says much of the optimism now surrounding the industry
assumes there will only be limited construction of new capacity.
The reason for this optimism is simple: prices in virtually every pulp and
paper segment are on the rise and in an industry characterised by strong
cyclical patterns there is every indication that the market is firmly on the
road up to its next peak two or three years hence. The price of northern
bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry staple, has already reached
Dollars 700 a tonne, up 80 per cent from Dollars 390 at the end of last
year. Prices for fine paper, of which pulp is the major constituent, have
been increased five times in 1994. Now the trend is feeding further down to
the chain to newsprint and magazine paper grades where rises of 10 and 20
per cent have either been implemented or notified.
The upturn has been demand-driven in line with the recovering world economy.
Increased volumes first boosted operating rates and are now lifting prices.
In Finland, the forestry industry is effectively running flat out with an
operating rate of 94 per cent, compared with 88 per cent last year.
The recovery is at an early stage and prices are still below the levels
reached at the last market peak in 1989-1990. 'Paper and board prices fell
by 30 to 35 per cent between 1991 and 1993,' notes Mr Jarl Kohler, managing
director of the Finnish Forestry Industries Federation.
The pulp price reached Dollars 840 a tonne in 1989, and although most
pundits believe that peak may well be scaled during the current upswing,
they warn that progress is unlikely to be even. 'There is a serious chance
of an inventory-driven correction in the second half of 1995,' says Mr
Asprem.
There is also a strong possibility that companies will be unable to get the
price rises they are seeking in full. For example, analysts say newsprint
producers may be optimistic in hoping for a 20 per cent price increase from
the start of next year. Buyer resistance could limit the rise to between 10
and 15 per cent despite stronger demand and a surge in waste paper prices.
Although Nordic forestry groups are back in profit, the turnaround has
stemmed from cost-cutting, volume increases and currency factors. In the
first half of this year, higher prices were only just starting to feed
through to the bottom line.
There will be a more pronounced impact in the second half, although much of
the gain will be offset by the recent strengthening of both the Finnish and
Swedish currencies. With some segments - uncoated magazine paper, for
example - prices are almost certainly going to be lower in local currency
terms in 1994 than they were in 1993.
Stronger currencies are not the only worry for the Nordic producers. Their
costs are going up - particularly for pulp wood, which has risen by around
15 per cent since the market trough. There is also a widespread expectation
that the 1995 wage round is going to be a difficult one as employees seek
their share of the sector's upturn. Finally, there is the dampening effect
of high long-term interest rates.
Mr Kohler notes that every 1 per cent interest rate increase costs the
Finnish forestry industry FM650m (Pounds 85m), every 1 per cent rise in the
markka FM400m, every 1 per cent rise in wood costs FM120m and every 1 per
cent increase in salaries FM100m. He also points out that although Finnish
pulp and paper companies will earn more than FM3bn this year, income will be
well short of the 'normal' FM7bn level required to cover investments, debt
repayments, R &amp; D costs etc.
A spending spree in the late 1980s and early 1990s left most of Finland's
big forestry groups heavily in debt and they have been in no hurry to
announce new investments this time round. Instead, the talk in the country's
forestry industry has been of streamlining and mergers.
Even so, the return to profitability and low short-term interest rates are
fast reducing the debt burden and the strengthening markka is cutting the
cost of servicing the foreign currency element of it. It may not be long
before the Finns are tempted to follow the example of their neighbours by
ordering new machinery.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: FSU metal use seen staying low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metals consumption in the former Soviet Union may be nearing the limit of
its dramatic decline but it is not about to recovery rapidly, according to
Mr David Humphreys, economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's largest
mining group.
Meanwhile, metals production in the region almost certainly had further to
fall, 'implying that the broadest part of the export bubble is now passed.'
In any case, said Mr Humphries at a conference organised by IBC Financial
Focus, contrary to public perception, the reform process in the former
Soviet Union had had a fairly limited impact on world markets for the major
base metals in physical terms - 'although the effect on prices has
admittedly been rather greater on account of the uncertainty associated with
the FSU's export behaviour'. The key exception - and a big one - was
aluminium.
Copper, lead and zinc consumption in the FSU had fallen by half since 1990
while aluminium and nickel use was down by nearly 75 per cent. A revival of
metals use was highly dependent on investment but this was not forthcoming
because of the outlook for demand, high interest rates, and lack of investor
security, as well as 'the immediate political requirement to protect
consumers from deprivation'. But without investment if was difficult to see
how metal consumption could recover.
Russia's commodity exporters had been generating substantial foreign
exchange earnings but this money was not being reinvested and in some cases
not being returned to the economy at all.
It was not a question of waiting for a cyclical swing to prompt a restart of
idled industrial capacity because much of that which was idle was obsolete
or, in the case of military installations, irrelevant, and would never work
again.
On the other hand, most of the FSU's metallurgical plant was serviceable
even if it was neither efficient or environmentally friendly. But its mines
were in extremely poor condition. So, 'in the absence of substantial
investment in the FSU's mines and metals sector - and soon - it is by no
means impossible that when the recovery does eventually begin to bite and
metals consumption starts to grow again, there will be a period in which the
area will become a net importer of certain major base metals'.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts welcome RPI data and outperform
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government bond market yesterday welcomed statistics which revealed
benign inflationary pressures in the economy by rising half a point, and
outperforming US Treasuries.
The retail price index rose 2.2 per cent, which was less than the 2.4 per
cent expected. Labour market figures were interpreted as being good for
gilts.
'Nobody could claim that these numbers are anything but very excellent. They
have taken away all the negative feelings which last month's numbers had
given gilts,' said one dealer.
'It feels like a change in sentiment but it might be premature to say that.
But with numbers and interest rates as they are there is clearly a good case
for the market to get itself on a firmer footing,' he added.
One securities house reported good demand for gilts from US buyers, and the
spread of gilts over US Treasury bonds narrowed to around 94 basis points,
from around 102 the day before. Some dealers said the Bank of England was
taking advantage of the strong market to supply
stock.
Mr Simon Briscoe of S. G. Warburg said: 'Every day this month there has been
a trickle of investors moving round to the bullish view.'
He pointed out that the lower-than-expected RPI figure and fall in total
unemployment would save the government a total of Pounds 2bn a year in
social security benefits. He said: 'Funding is less of a pressure than in
other countries.'
The reaction of the gilt market was subdued, said Mr Chris Dillow of Nomura.
'I think that is justified,' he said. 'It will be difficult to see RPI
inflation staying this
low.'
The December gilt future on Liffe lifted  1/2 a point on the day to 100 9/32
in late trading. The yield spread over bunds narrowed to around 124 in late
trading.
German government bonds were hardly changed yesterday, as investors stood on
the sidelines ahead of today's meeting of the Bundesbank council and the
elections on Sunday.
Mr Karl Haeling at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said: 'We have rallied for
almost two days. The market is a little overbought and needs a breather. It
has been a consolidation day.'
The December bund future was around 89.51 in late trading, up 0.04 of a
point on the day.
US Treasury bonds drifted lower yesterday as the market awaited a barrage of
economic data to be released today and tomorrow.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  9/32 lower
at 95 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.887 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/16 at 99, to yield 6.653 per cent.
After two sessions of sharp gains, bonds gave back some ground in lacklustre
trad-ing.
In spite of the retrenchment, the underlying tone was positive. Traders were
generally of the opinion that the Federal Reserve would delay its next
credit tightening until November, providing some room to manoeuvre going
into the important economic data due out at the end of the week.
Most economists were expecting the news to be benign. Forecasts centre on a
slight 0.1 per cent gain in September producer prices, and a 0.4 per cent
increase when the volatile energy and food sectors are excluded. Such
readings would present no obstacle for the inflation-sensitive Treasury
market.
News of inflation on the consumer level and crucial data on industrial
production will follow on Friday.
Yesterday, bonds crept a little closer to their starting marks after release
of the Atlanta Federal Reserve's monthly survey. The report was favourable
for fixed-rate securities, showing a general slowdown in manufacturing
activity and an easing of price pressures.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Aegon's Dollars 600m convertible meets
strong demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue-chip corporates were again prominent in the euromarkets yesterday with
both J. Sainsbury and Ford raising funds in the three-year dollar sector and
Aegon, the Dutch insurance company, tapping the market for Dollars 600m with
one of the biggest European convertible issues of the year.
J. Sainsbury, the UK retailer, raised Dollars 150m to help fund its recent
acquisition of Giant Food, the US supermarket chain. The paper offered a
coupon of 7.375 per cent and an initial yield spread of 39 basis over the
equivalent US Treasury, although this widened marginally when the bonds were
freed to trade.
Two-thirds of the issue was placed by the end of trading, although JP
Morgan, the lead manager, conceded that distribution was becoming more
difficult in the short end of the dollar sector following issues earlier
this week by SmithKline Beecham and Toyota.
Ford Credit Europe turned to the sterling sector for Pounds 100m with a
three-year issue. The paper, sold to investors at a reoffer price of 99.705,
offered a coupon of 8 5/8 per cent and, at its reoffer price, a yield spread
of 55 basis points above the equivalent gilt.
Lead managers HSBC Markets said investors were showing interest in
shorter-term sterling deals, following recent steepening of the yield curve.
Morgan Stanley led the 10-year subordinated convertible bond for Aegon,
which has expanded in the US in recent years. The bond carries a coupon of
4.75 per cent and has been used partially to refinance a Dollars 370m
10-year subordinated convertible bond issued in 1991.
The issue, one of Europe's biggest in a generally quiet year for
convertibles, met strong demand from continental Europe, according to
syndicate managers.
Elsewhere, Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, raised
FFr1bn with a five-year deal offering a coupon of 8 per cent. The deal was
offered to investors at a re-offer price of 100.08, with a yield spread of
32 points over the equivalent French government bond. Prices fell slightly
after the syndicate closed, ending down 2 basis points.
Credit Local de France tapped the short end of the lire sector with a L150bn
three-year bond with a coupon of 11.3 per cent. Proceeds from the deal, led
by Credito Italiano, were swapped into floating rate dollars.
Two borrowers tapped the three-year area of the Canadian dollar sector. The
European Investment Bank launched a CDollars 150m offering of bonds, priced
to yield 10 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The pricing spread
tightened to around six basis points when the bonds were freed to trade,
joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said.
Rabobank Nederland launched a CDollars 100m offering of bonds, also priced
to yield a spread of 10 basis points over Canadian government bonds. The
spread narrowed slightly to nine basis points over in late trading.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Argentina returns to
syndicated loan sector 10 years on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Argentina has tapped the syndicated loan market for the first time in more
than 10 years by signing an 18-month Dollars 500m credit with banks led by
Credit Suisse and Chemical Bank.
The deal is being seen by the Argentine finance ministry as a vote of
confidence in the three-year-old economic stabilisation plan which has
combined rapid growth with Latin America's lowest inflation rate.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, finance minister, said conclusion of the deal made
Argentina the first Latin American country to return to this segment of the
international financial market.
The loan, signed in New York on Tuesday, will have an interest rate of 150
basis points above Libor and will cover revenue shortfalls prompted
specifically by delays in the privatisation of several gas distribution
companies. Final documentation should be signed early next week.
However, the deal comes against the background of recent economic indicators
that show a widening trade deficit, falls in tax collec-tion and the edging
up of monthly inflation to 0.7 per cent.
Provisional figures released last week showed the trade deficit for August
swelling to Dollars 620m, bringing the eight-month gap to a record Dollars
3.84bn. Although exports are likely to rise by 20 per cent this year,
imports have surged still faster and last month broke the Dollars 2bn
barrier.
Mr Cavallo says he is unconcerned because capital goods, imports of which
have risen 60 per cent this year, account for the bulk of the increase.
Capital goods would help to sharpen competitiveness, feed into higher
exports and head off any balance of payments problems.
The government has reiterated its rejection of calls from some business
quarters for an export-boosting devaluation of the peso. This week,
President Carlos Menem said: 'There is no possibility of changing any part
of the (economic) model, especially the exchange rate.'
Referring to Latin America's past experience with devaluation and resulting
inflationary pressures, Mr Menem said: 'We have already watched that movie.'
Mr Cavallo also dismissed suggestions that spending pressures before next
May's presidential election would lead to fiscal deficits for the first time
since the launch of his economic reforms. 'The accounts for the third
quarter do not see the surplus of the first two quarters, but this had
already been forecast.' Budgets would be balanced this year and in 1995, he
said.
Inflation too, up in September because of seasonal factors and a recent
one-off rise in transport fares would beat this year's 4 per cent target, Mr
Cavallo said.
Other international banks participating in the deal are Banco Santander,
Dresdner Bank, Bank of Boston, UBS and ING. Local banks participating are
Banco Roberts, Banco Rio de la Plata, Banco Frances Rio de la Plata, Banco
de Credito Argentino, Banco General de Negocios and Banco de Quilmes.

Bruce Jacques in Sydney. MIM said Asarco was filing a universal shelf
registration statement covering the issue of up to USDollars 300m in equity
and debt securities with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. MIM had
requested that its Asarco stock be included in this filing.
Asarco shares have been trading recently at around USDollars 33 on the New

holding company's stake in the subsidiaries down to 52 per cent.
Lauritzen reported a first-half loss (before minority shares) of DKr198m
(Dollars 32.67m) this year, following a full-year loss of DKr171m in 1993.
Lauritzen Shipping made a pre-tax loss of DKr240m in the first half

Strong US and European demand for fabricated products, better pricing and
more rationalisation moved Alcan Aluminium, the Canadian aluminium group,
firmly into the black for the third quarter and first nine months, writes
Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Third-quarter net profit was USDollars 66m, or
27 cents a common share, against a loss of USDollars 13m, or 8 cents, a year
earlier. The quarter included a special after-tax gain of USDollars 27m
mainly on the sale of Alcan Australia. Revenues were USDollars 2.2bn, up 21
per cent.
Nine months' net profit was USDollars 48m, or 15 cents, against a loss of
USDollars 68m, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were USDollars 6.1bn,
up 12 per cent.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodyear sees higher third-term
earnings

<TEXT>
Goodyear, the US tyre maker, said that it would report third-quarter
earnings of between 97 cents and Dollars 1 a share, a range which puts it in
line with most market forecasts, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Mr Stanley Gault, chairman, gave the projection in a speech to a meeting of
securities analysts yesterday. Sales for the period to the end of September
were more than 6 per cent up on the Dollars 2.9bn of the 1993 period, he
added.
The improvement in earnings per share, from 92 cents a year earlier, comes
against the background of rising rubber prices, which had threatened to put
pressure on margins.
Separately, Goodyear said it would acquire a 60 per cent interest in a
manufacturing joint venture with Quingdao Gold Lion Hose, the largest
producer of automotive hose in China. The total investment for the joint
venture is valued at Dollars 20m, of which 60 per cent will come from
Goodyear.

<TEXT>
Ciba, the Swiss chemicals and pharma-ceuticals group, reported a 2.4 per
cent drop in sales in the third quarter to SFr5bn (Dollars 3.9bn) and
softened its profit forecast for the full year, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Ciba blamed the strength of the Swiss franc for the downward trend, which
was already apparent in the first half.
The performance of the important healthcare sector, which accounts for 38
per cent of group sales, continued to deteriorate in the face of pressures
on healthcare costs. Its sales were down 9 per cent to SFr2.1bn in the third
quarter while those of the pharmaceuticals division fell 8 per cent to
SFr1.47bn
Sales in the industry sector, covering mainly chemical businesses, were flat
at SFr2bn. This was a slight improvement over the previous two quarters,
'due to a modest economic recovery'.
The agricultural sector also had flat sales of SFr847m, after a 2 per cent
fall in the first half.
For the nine months, group sales were down 3 per cent to SFr16.6bn, but Ciba
said that they were up 3 per cent expressed in local currencies.
The group said it expected an 'increased operating profit' in the full year,
which was a slightly less optimistic forecast than its statement in August
that net income would be at least as high as 1993's SFr1.78bn.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch seeks decision on
Czech brewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Anheuser-Busch has increased pressure on the Czech government to decide the
future of Budejovicky Budvar, the Czech Republic's most famous brewer in
which the US group is trying to take a minority stake.
In two related moves, Anheuser-Busch says it is suspending negotiations on
buying 34 per cent of Budvar, and is not renewing a moratorium on legal
action in a dispute between the two companies on use of the Budweiser
trademark.
However, it also said it was no longer linking the purchase of the stake to
a resolution of the trademark dispute, which is hampering Anheuser-Busch's
plans to market its own Budweiser brand in important European markets such
as Germany.
Mr Jack Purnell, chairman and chief executive of Anheuser-Busch
International, said he hoped the separation of the investment from the
trademark dispute would 'advance progress on both issues'. It is expected
that the dispute will be resolved before any investment is made.
Anheuser-Busch said on Tuesday that discussions on the equity stake would be
postponed until the government decided how the Czech brewer should be
privatised. Negotiations on making an investment began in 1990, and earlier
this year it was named the sole foreign negotiating partner in Budvar's
privatisation.
However, agreement between the government and Anheuser-Busch has never been
in sight. This is partly due to Czech sensitivities about one of its most
famous brand names being swallowed by a large multinational, and partly to
growing hostility within the country to foreign investment.
Anheuser-Busch said that in spite of being given exclusive negotiating
access, the government 'could not reach a consensus to follow through on
this commitment' and that it had 'concluded that the privatisation process
is stalled indefinitely in the Czech government'.
The agriculture ministry, which owns Budvar, declined to comment on
Anheuser-Busch's decision. However, it is understood that a decision on the
brewer's future could be made within a month.
While the government decides how Budvar should be privatised Anheuser-Busch
and Budvar are to pursue negotiations on reaching a stand-alone trademark
agreement.
Mr Jiri Bucek, general-director of Budvar, said the moratorium on legal
action, which expired on September 30, was no longer being accepted by many
courts. 'It must be admitted that it is out of date,' he said.
Budvar is keen to link with Anheuser-Busch to expand sales of its own
Budweiser brand. Its main export markets are Germany and Austria, but it is
seeking to expand into other European markets, particularly the UK.
The company reported profits of Kcs133m (Dollars 4.8m) in the first half of
this year.
Anheuser-Busch said any new agreement reached 'would not be as comprehensive
as the one offered to Budvar in combination with Anheuser-Busch's proposal
for a minority investment in the brewery'.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese takeover brings new
stresses - Mitsubishi Bank will take advantage of its current monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The implications of yesterday's takeover of Nippon Trust Bank by Mitsubishi
Bank go far beyond the narrow question of the viability of one small trust
bank; it will produce new stresses in Japan's fragile and overcrowded
banking sector.
In rescuing the ailing bank, Mitsubishi, already one of Japan's strongest
financial institutions, but limited by law in its scope, becomes the first
to be permitted to conduct the full range of trust banking operations.
Although Mitsubishi has paid a high price for its entrance into this
lucrative market, its competitors are concerned that the move gives it an
unfair competitive advantage, and are likely to step up pressure on the
regulators to open up the financial markets further.
For years, the labyrinth of regulations in Japan's financial sector firmly
restricted the activities of the participants. City banks, large commercial
lenders such as Mitsubishi, were allowed to conduct the mainstream business
of wholesale and retail borrowing and lending. Trust banks ran trust banking
operations such as pension fund management; long-term credit banks engaged
in investment finance; and brokers were restricted to underwriting and
trading securities.
But in the past decade, under pressure at home and abroad to deregulate, the
ministry of finance has pursued a gradual policy of removing the partition
walls. All banks are now permitted to run limited broking businesses,
brokers can operate banking-style deposit accounts, and last year the
ministry allowed city banks to establish trust bank subsidiaries.
So far these measures have been cautious in scope. Banks may conduct only
limited securities business, and the trust banks' deregulation does not
allow city banks to conduct the most profitable aspect of their business,
pension fund management and loan trusts. These restrictions were designed to
protect the existing companies' core business.
But yesterday's move by Mitsubishi, sanctioned by the finance ministry,
drives a coach and horses through the rules, enabling the bank to conduct
the full range of trust business, and giving it a substantial advantage both
over rival city banks and the existing trust banks.
Mitsubishi has paid a substantial price for what amounts to a trust banking
licence. The Y200bn (Dollars 1.98bn) injection of capital is well above the
target company's market capitalisation of Y107bn. The return is just 50 per
cent of the future profits.
Those profits are unlikely to amount to much in the next few years. Declared
non-performing loans at the bank are around Y130bn, but the true value of
bad assets including restructured loans is closer to Y500bn (28 per cent of
the total loan book), and substantial provisioning is therefore likely to
weaken profitability further.
Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said
Mitsubishi is calculating that the longer term benefits of a trust bank
operation will outweigh the considerable cost of the takeover. 'In the
short-term, it is an expensive purchase, with little prospect of any early
significant return from Nippon Trust itself. But Mitsubishi is counting on
its being well-positioned to compete in the fund management market,
especially in the pensions area . . . .'
The stock market appeared to share that view. Mitsubishi's shares rose by
nearly 3 per cent as investors anticipated the longer-term advantages.
But the key to the bank's success may depend on how long it has the field to
itself. City banks and trust banks were both yesterday reported to be upset
at the decision to approve the takeover.
Trust banks had lobbied hard to prevent the big commercial banks from
encroaching on their territory and the ministry's decision represents a
significant blow to their market position. The deal is likely to place
further strains on the relationship between the city bank and Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking Corporation, a sister bank in the giant Mitsubishi
keiretsu, one of Japan's largest corporate groupings.
Some analysts expected the finance ministry, under pressure from other
banks, to hasten a wider deregulation of the banking sector. But officials
were adamant that the decision was a special response to a particular crisis
at Nippon Trust. They pointed to parallels with the takeover of Cosmo
Securities, a medium-sized broker last year by Daiwa Bank.
No other banks have subsequently been permitted to operate the full range of
broking activities, and the ministry has no plans to allow them.
But it will be the chronic fragility of the entire banking sector that will
ultimately decide the pace of further liberalisation. Although Nippon Trust
was clearly the weakest of the trust banks it was by no means alone in
having a huge portfolio of bad debts.
The likely solution lies in further consolidation of the industry. That
will, in time, eliminate the demarcations of the financial markets faster
than the ministry plans. For the moment, though, Mitsubishi is set to
exploit its monopoly privilege.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: UAP shares slide in wake of
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance
group, fell yesterday after it posted figures indicating the impact of
turbulent bond and equity markets on its assets had been worse than
expected.
UAP shares dropped FFr6.80 to FFr131.70 following publication of results
late on Tuesday showing consolidated profits down 22 per cent to FFr853m
(Dollars 161.2m) in the first six months of the year.
Mr Jacques Friedman, UAP chairman, predicted that final 1994 results would
show an improvement over 1993, 'but not to the extent of the objectives we
had set ourselves in very different conditions a few months ago'.
The group revealed yesterday that the market value of its insurance
companies' investments was FFr625bn at the end of June, compared with
FFr672bn at the end of last year. Unrealised capital gains fell to FFr45bn
at the end of June from FFr81bn at the end of last year. Analysts attributed
the drop largely to the performance of European bonds and equities.
Though UAP believes that insurance market conditions are improving, it
acknowledged that the deterioration of property as well as financial markets
had a negative impact on its results.
The group expects Banque Worms, the combined commercial, merchant and
investment bank it controls, to break even in 1995 and make a profit the
following year. The bank is estimated to have cost UAP FFr6bn since 1991 but
many of the banks worst property loans have been transfered to insurance
divisions.

shake-up

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Louis Gerstner, who took over as chairman and chief executive of
International Business Machines 18 months ago, claimed yesterday he had
succeeded in making the lumbering giant of the computer industry more
fleetfooted.
'The elephant is dancing,' Mr Gerstner said, 'but it is not going to be in a
Fred Astaire movie too soon'.
Answering questions at his first European press conference since taking
charge of the ailing US computer manufacturer last year, Mr Gerstner said
one of his main tasks was to speed up the responsiveness of the company.
'I think we have made a lot of progress,' he said, but added that '18 months
is not a very long time and this process will take longer'.
Next week, IBM will report its third-quarter results and Wall Street
analysts are expecting the company to continue its progress with earnings of
around 90 cents a share, compared with an operating loss of 12 cents a share
in last year's third quarter.
The IBM chairman declined to comment on persistent speculation that the
company may take an equity stake in Apple Computer. But he confirmed that
IBM has 'ongoing discussions with Apple in the areas where we have very
important joint activities'. These include joint development of PowerPC
microprocessors and two software joint ventures.
Mr Gerstner said IBM had a continued commitment 'to be the basic foundry' of
the computer industry, but too often it had developed new technology only to
see competitors exploit it more quickly. 'There have been many examples
where other companies have exploited that technology faster than IBM.'
He said IBM expected to ship personal computers based on the PowerPC
microprocessor, jointly developed with Apple Computer and Motorola, in the
first quarter of next year. Apple and Motorola are already selling PowerPCs.
On the restructuring, the IBM chairman said progress in Europe towards
meeting competitive cost levels was ahead of schedule and that the group as
a whole was on target to reduce its worldwide workforce to 215,000 by
year-end.
Asked if he was satisfied with IBM's share of the PC market, which fell from
about 14 to about 10 per cent over the past year, he acknowledged IBM had
had some problems.

full year

<TEXT>
Kone, the Finnish lifts group which on Monday agreed to buy Montgomery
Elevator of the US for Dollars 280m, saw underlying profits dip slightly in
the first eight months. However, it expected full-year figures to be higher
than in 1993.
Group income after financing items amounted to FM167m (Dollars 31m), against
FM192m a year earlier. The 1993 figure included a FM21m currency exchange
gain.
Kone said comparisons with last year were distorted by a 9 per cent
strengthening in the Finnish markka and the sale of a number of non-core
operations.
Sales in the latest period were FM4.8bn, just under last year's level
allowing for divestments and currency factors.
Operating profits fell to FM205m from FM299m but the impact was offset by a
sharp reduction in interest costs to FM53m from FM145m.
Mr Gerhard Wendt, president, said the important European market remained
sluggish, as improving areas were balanced by those in recession.
New elevator orders and maintenance contracts were 4 per cent higher on an
underlying basis at FM3.54bn. The group saw higher orders from the UK,
Germany, Italy and Australia but there were declines in Sweden, Finland,
France and Belgium. The group expected new orders for the full year to equal
last year's FM5.71bn.
The group has tried to lift operations in Asia and build up the maintenance
side of its business. At the end of August it had 363,000 units under
maintenance.
Kone has sold its cranes unit, a wood unit, and MacGregor-Navire, a supplier
of shipboard handling equipment, since the end of August 1993.
These helped reduce the interest-bearing debt to FM400m at the end of August
from more than FM1bn at the end of 1993 and strengthened the financial
position.

<TEXT>
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) increased its after-tax
earnings by 14 per cent in the three months to September, despite the sharp
fall-off in mortgage refinancings in the US this year caused by higher
interest rates.
Net interest income of Dollars 727.7m was up 10 per cent from a year before,
reflecting a narrowing of the company's net interest margin from 140 basis
points (hundredths of a percentage point) to 125 basis points.
Net earnings of Dollars 542.7m, or Dollars 1.98 a share, were in line with
analysts' expectations, and up from Dollars 477.2m, or Dollars 1.74, a year
before.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: CBS holds dividend in spite of
slide

<TEXT>
Net income at CBS, the US television broadcasting network, slumped 51 per
cent in the third quarter. The company, which is regarded as a takeover
candidate after the failure of its proposed merger with the QVC home
shopping group in June, blamed the fall mainly on a higher tax charge and
the absence of one-off gains.
However, sales were down because of the absence of professional football and
baseball coverage this year. CBS lost the rights to both last year, being
outbid for professional football by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox network. The
major league baseball season was cancelled this year by a players' strike.
Results were affected by higher costs for prime-time film showings, lower
ratings for day-time programmes and lower syndication sales, the company
said. However, Mr Lawrence Tisch, chairman, said operating results from the
company's own TV and radio stations were higher as a result of strong local
advertising expenditure.
Sales fell 4 per cent for the quarter to Dollars 726m while pre-tax profit
was down 44 per cent at Dollars 82.3m. Adjusting for a one-off legal
settlement from Viacom last year, the underlying fall was 30 per cent. After
a tax charge of 29 per cent compared to 19 per cent, net income was Dollars
58.4m against Dollars 118.2m, or 77 cents a share compared with Dollars
1.48. The quarterly dividend was held at 10 cents. CBS shares closed Dollars
9 lower at Dollars 330.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft defends
actions in curbing US losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German industrial and trading company, said
last night losses on its rolling forward controversial US oil contracts
would have reached Dollars 50m a month last December if it had not acted to
unwind them.
Defending the way it dealt with the loss-making contracts - in which
derivatives (mostly futures) were used to hedge long-term fixed price
contracts - it said the authors of critical articles in the US had
misunderstood the nature of the crisis facing the company.
This nearly led to the collapse of the company, forcing German banks to head
a DM3.4bn (Dollars 2.19bn) rescue effort in January this year.
'We're happy with what we've done and will remain happy with what we've
done,' said Mr Michael Hutchinson, managing director of Metallgesellschaft
Ltd in London and a member of the team which dealt with the liquidity
problems stemming from the contracts.
Metallgesellschaft argued there had been no alternative to its strategy.
It said the authors of the US articles, including Mr Merton Miller, a Nobel
prize-winner for economics, had subsequently corrected some of their
opinions in a new article to be published soon.
Mr Hutchinson said the US oil trading subsidiary suffered 'very substantial
cash losses' every month as it closed out and then reinstated its entire
trading position - 'a position so large that it was the equivalent of 85
days worth of the entire oil output of Kuwait'.
The losses stemmed from falling oil prices and a sustained contango (futures
prices at a premium over spot prices).
The contango losses rose to between Dollars 20m and Dollars 30m a month and
would have reached Dollars 50m in December if the company had not begun
unwinding its position.
It declined to comment on how the company had got into this situation,
citing this Friday's court hearing over the Dollars 1bn compensation claim
by Mr Arthur Benson, a former senior executive at MG Marketing &amp; Refining in
New York.
MG Corp, a US unit of Metallgesellschaft, said it had paid Dollars 900m in
margin calls on oil hedges in 1993 and lost at least Dollars 40m in October
and November that year in the oil futures market, Reuter adds from New York.

disappoint Wall Street

<TEXT>
Continuing strength in timber prices and rebounding pulp and packaging
markets boosted Weyerhaeuser's third quarter earnings, but the profits jump
fell short of Wall Street's expectations, the company's stock price closing
down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 41 3/8 yesterday.
Weyerhaeuser, the world's largest private owner of saleable softwood timber,
reported third-quarter earnings - before extraordinary charges  - of Dollars
144m, or 71 cents a share, compared with income of Dollars 67m, or 32 cents,
a year earlier.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.68bn, up from Dollars 2.22bn last year.
Analysts had expected Weyerhaeuser to earn about 77 cents a share in the
quarter.
For the year to date, Weyerhaeuser earnings total Dollars 399.8m, or Dollars
1.95, on sales of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 477m, or Dollars
2.33, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn for last year's corresponding period.
The company's pulp, paper and packaging arm saw operating earnings jump to
Dollars 63.5m in the quarter, from Dollars 2.5m in 1993's third quarter.
Weyerhaeuser's big forest product division's operating earnings rose to
Dollars 246.1m, from Dollars 165.8m.
'The company continues to realise steady improvements in earnings as the
momentum in the recovering pulp, paper, and packaging markets continues,' Mr
John Creighton, president, said.
'At the same time, our timberlands and wood products performance remains
strong in spite of increasing interest rates. While it appears that housing
starts in the US have peaked, we are in the early stages of the economic
recoveries in Europe and Japan which bodes well for continued strengthening
in our pulp and paper businesses.'
Weyerhaeuser is the second US forest products group to fall short of
analysts' estimates this quarter. On Tuesday, International Paper's stock
fell after it revealed a 47 per cent third-quarter profits rise.
Tenneco plans to spend Dollars 73m upgrading the linerboard capacity at its
Packing Corporation of America division.
The investment will boost PCA's linerboard output by 16 per cent and give
Tenneco a stronger hold in the rapidly rebounding containerboard market.
Linerboard is used to make corrugated boxes.
The investment in its packaging division is part of Tenneco's strategy to
redeploy capital into high-return growth opportunities in its packaging,
automotive parts and natural gas businesses. Last week, the company
announced a Dollars 60m acquisition for its Tenneco Gas unit.

<TEXT>
The US management consulting arm of Deloitte and Touche, the world's fifth
biggest accountancy firm, is being sued for Dollars 250m.
Figgie International, a struggling Ohio-based group, alleges that Deloitte
failed in its promise to install a world class manufacturing programme for
the company.
While it is not uncommon for accountancy firms to be sued, it is very
unusual in the case of management consultants.
Figgie says that over a three-year period beginning in late 1990, Deloitte
promised 'to develop and transfer technologies that would improve
manufacturing throughput (and) decrease inventory levels'. It claims to have
paid Deloitte fees and expenses of over Dollars 22m, and to have been billed
for a further Dollars 33m.
In the event, Figgie moved from a net profit of Dollars 63m in 1989 to a
loss last year of Dollars 129m. Having breached financial covenants, it was
forced into a financial restructuring this summer.
Figgie's business ranges from electronic systems and materials handling
equipment to insurance, sports goods and real estate.
Figgie says 'the consulting firm at various times misrepresented to Figgie
the progress and achievements of the world class manufacturing projects it
designed and implemented'.
It also claims Deloitte failed to staff the projects with professionally
competent personnel.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Study makes new claims of Nasdaq
collusion - Allegations that dealers conspired on prices give fresh impetus
to legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new twist has been added to the debate about pricing on the Nasdaq stock
market. Four months after a US academic study claimed that dealers on the
Nasdaq colluded to keep spreads between buy and sell prices unnecessarily
wide, a second study by the same university professors has given the debate
new impetus.
The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which runs the
screen-based Nasdaq market, vehemently rejected the claims in the first
study - but this time it is refusing to comment.
Reticence is probably well-advised, because the issue is at the centre of a
legal battle that could culminate in some of Wall Street's biggest firms
paying out millions of dollars to investors.
When the first study on spreads was published in May by Mr William Christie
of Vanderbilt University and Mr Paul Schultz of Ohio State University, it
prompted the filing of scores of class action lawsuits against the Wall
Street firms which act as dealers on Nasdaq.
The lawsuits alleged that collusion between the dealing firms to keep
spreads wide deprived investors of the best possible price on share trades
and violated US anti-trust laws.
Wide spreads are regarded as bad for investors because they deny them the
opportunity to pay a little less when buying a stock or receive a little
more when selling. For dealers, the wider the spread, the bigger the profit
they make.
The lawsuits relied heavily on the findings of the Christie-Schultz study,
but now lawyers have more ammunition to use against the Nasdaq dealers as
the second study, by the same two authors plus another Ohio State finance
professor, Mr Jeffrey Harris, claims to have found fresh evidence of
collusion.
While the first report said the dealers had been conspiring for years to
keep spreads wide, the new study says dealers have since colluded to narrow
their spreads.
According to the three professors, within days of the study's publication in
May attacking dealers for the wide spreads, Nasdaq dealers narrowed the
spreads they quoted on some of the market's biggest stocks, including such
well-known companies as Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computer.
More specifically, the professors claim that whereas before the first study,
dealers invariably quoted their buy and sell prices in even-eighths of a
dollar - Dollars   1/4 , Dollars  1/2 , Dollars  3/4 , or a whole dollar -
the day after newspapers reported the study's critical findings dealers
began quoting prices in the long-neglected fractions of odd-eighths, such as
Dollars  1/8 and Dollars  3/8 , as well as even-eighths.
For example, before the first study was released dealers would quote
investors Dollars 50 1/2 if they wanted to buy a company's stock and Dollars
50 1/4 if they wanted to sell. After the study was publicised dealers would
quote Dollars 50 3/8 to buy and Dollars 50 1/4 to sell - a spread of only
Dollars  1/8 , compared with Dollars  1/4 before.
After the first study was reported on May 26, the change in spreads was
sudden and dramatic, says Mr Christie. 'Starting from May 27, marketmakers
began using odd-eighths en masse. There was a complete switch.'
And it was not just a case of a few firms using quotes of odd-eighths. For
each stock they looked at, says Mr Christie, 'there was a minimum of 40
marketmakers, and some stocks had over 60'. These firms, he claims, had not
used odd-eighths in years. 'Suddenly, they all started using them.'
When asked what conclusion could be drawn from the dealers' actions, Mr
Christie responds: 'Cynically, you could say that it was good of Paul
(Schultz) and I to remind them that they had these odd-eighths available.'
Alternatively, he says the fact that they all moved at once suggested the
change had been co-ordinated. 'Our evidence suggests spreads narrowed
because an implicit agreement among marketmakers to maintain spreads of at
least Dollars  1/4 was abandoned.'
Although the professors imply that the dealers colluded to narrow spreads
because of publicity surrounding the original study, they nevertheless
welcome the resultant cost savings to investors. They calculated that after
the shift to narrower quotes using odd-eighths, investors' transaction costs
declined by 40 per cent to 50 per cent.
When Mr Christie and Mr Schultz published their first findings in May, the
NASD said there was no evidence of collusion between dealers and argued that
what investors lost through wider spreads, they gained in the guarantee of
liquidity afforded by the multiple dealer system.
If spreads were narrower, the NASD said, dealers would find it harder to
make a profit and some would be forced to abandon making a market in stocks.
The subsequent reduction in liquidity would only harm investors.
This argument, however, appears to have been undermined by the second study,
which found that after dealers started using odd-eighth quotes and
effectively halved the size of spreads, the number of marketmakers in each
stock did not decline.
The second study threatens to greatly embarrass the NASD greatly because for
its findings strike at the heart of the very structure of the Nasdaq system,
which the NASD trumpets in television advertising as 'the stock market for
the next 100 years'. Under the system, investors are meant to get the best
price service because competition among multiple dealers for orders should
keep spreads narrow.
There is little doubt that the new study will be used by lawyers in the
cases that have been filed against several Nasdaq dealers.
Although it is still early in the legal process, lawyers involved in the
class action suits estimate the damages that will be sought from dealers by
disgruntled investors could be as much as Dollars 100m for every trading
year.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Spotlight turns on new
commodities fund - Investors are becoming increasingly interested in the
sector / Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch last week by Barclays de Zoete Wedd of a commodities fund has
thrown the spotlight on an asset class in which investors are showing
increasing interest.
The fund will purchase a range of financial instruments whose returns are
linked to the value of underlying commodities, offering investors a new
route into a market traditionally difficult to access.
Its aim is to outperform a benchmark of commodity prices - the Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index - including energy, agricultural and livestock products, and
industrial materials and precious metals, weighted according to world
production.
Although it is the first to be listed in London, it is one of a number of
recent initiatives offering investors exposure to commodity-based
derivatives. Last month, for example, Japanese regulators licensed six firms
to offer investment funds specialising in futures and options on
commodities.
ED &amp; F. Man, the UK commodity broker, which already has about Dollars 440m
under management allocated to commodities, is set to launch a commodities
fund this month.
The range of individual derivative instruments on offer to these funds, and
to investors in general, has also widened recently.
'These tools allow investors to take financial positions in commodity
markets, without the physical exposure. They can use commodities as part of
their portfolio along with more traditional investments like bonds and
equities,' said Ms Emma Conyers, an associate responsible for commodity
investor marketing at JP Morgan.
Among products being marketed are:
Commodity linked notes, which have a maturity of anything between six months
to two years or longer, offer the investor either a principle or interest
rate which is tied to the price of a commodity or basket of commodities.
Commodity-linked warrants allow investors to buy call or put options which
are listed on an exchange. Options give the holder the right to sell (a put
option) or buy (a call option) commodities in the future at a price
determined at the outset. 'A significant activity this year has been in
commodity call option warrants which allow investors to participate in
rising prices,' said Mr Martin Fraenkel, manager of commodity risk
management at Chase Manhattan bank in London.
Another instrument - which is more common in the US than in Europe - is the
limited partnership, in which the investor becomes a partner in the
commodities fund and so benefits directly from the profits the fund makes.
Investors can also buy shares and bonds issued by the funds - the value of
the share and the coupon offered on the bond vary in value with the profit
the fund makes.
With bond and equity markets plummeting, commodities have come into their
own as protection against rising inflation, as a play on economic growth,
and, increasingly, as an alternative asset class in their own right.
Investors have become increasingly interested in assets that have, on some
basket measures, risen in price by around 23 per cent this year alone. They
are also attracted by the fact that prices of commodities, such as oil and
gas, zinc and copper, are inversely related to bonds and equities -
commodity prices rise while bond and equity prices fall.
'Over the last 10 years, commodities have been a very dull asset,' said Mr
Graeme Stephens, corporate finance manager at ED &amp; F. Man in Switzerland.
'But now there is a resurgence in commodity prices, driven by economic
growth in both the developed and developing world, and a resurgence of
interest in commodities themselves.'
But what happens when the world's economic cycle moves on and commodity
prices begin to fall again?
Many prices have already risen to such an extent that that some people are
questioning how much further they have to rise. Will commodity derivatives
and commodities funds then go out of fashion?
'It works both ways,' said Mr Stephens. 'What we want to see is price
movement up or down. We can exploit movement in either direction using
derivatives.'
'This commodities bull market is a little bit different from others,' said
Mr Fraenkel. 'This time the increased sophistication of derivative
instruments has reduced the barriers to entry, and this greater ease of
access means investors will maintain their exposure to commodities to keep
the diversity of their portfolios.'

Hungarian engine plant

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Audi, the executive car division of Volkswagen of Germany, is planning to
invest DM730m (Dollars 474m) in a new engine manufacturing plant in Hungary
over the next five years, it said yesterday.
The initial investment will be DM320m and the plant will be Audi's first 100
per cent-owned manufacturing base outside Germany. It is one of the biggest
post-communist foreign investments in Hungary and one of several in its
nascent car manufacturing sector which has attracted investments from
General Motors of the US and Suzuki of Japan.
The plant, which opened yesterday, will be the first to manufacture a new
five-valve cylinder engine developed by Audi for its new A4 model, the
successor to the Audi 80, due to be unveiled in Munich today.
In the first phase the plant, located in Gyor in western Hungary, will
employ 250 people and produce up to 750 1.8 litre engines a day. Production
is scheduled to rise to 2,000 a day by 1997. A third phase would extend the
scope of the local production and employ 860 people, the company said.
From 1996, the engine will be used for the Audi A6 and the planned A3 and
may be used by Volkswagen and its SEAT and Skoda subsidiaries.
The company said it aimed to source some components and parts locally within
two years but ruled out full-car manufacturing in Hungary. The group had an
option on a further 230,000 sq metres of land, as well as its existing
250,000 sq metre site, it said.
Future investment decisions would depend on demand for the new engine and on
whether Hungary retained its cost advantages, it said. The project will be
exempt from profit tax for the first five years of operation.
Audi chose the site in Gyor after looking at 180 locations in Europe.
Hungary has lower production costs than eastern Germany and Austria while
Hungarian labour costs in car manufacturing are about one-sixth those in
Germany.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: TWA mounts restructuring
campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to avert a financial crisis,
yesterday started campaigning to win support for a sweeping financial
restructuring that will nearly halve its debt.
Late on Tuesday, TWA announced a rescue plan under which creditors are being
asked to swap Dollars 800m of the company's Dollars 1.8bn debt for new
equity, taking their stake in the airline from 55 per cent to possibly 70
per cent. Employees, who now own 45 per cent of the airline, would see their
stake diluted to as little as 30 per cent.
If the rescue plan succeeds, TWA believes it will be able to survive the
lean winter months and return to profitability next year.
If it fails, the airline will almost certainly have to file for some form of
bankruptcy protection again.
TWA, once one of the world's biggest and best-known airlines, last went into
bankruptcy protection in 1992, weighed down by debt from a leveraged
buy-out.
It emerged from a chapter 11 reorganisation in November last year, but has
not made a profit since.
Earlier this year, most of the airline's senior executives were replaced.
Since then, many unprofitable routes have been axed, the airline's Atlanta
mini-hub has been closed, 3,000 jobs cuts have been announced, and the
airline's labour unions have agreed to productivity increases worth Dollars
130m-Dollars 140m a year.
Yesterday Mr Robert Peiser, chief financial officer, blamed TWA's present
financial difficulties on over-optimistic revenue assumptions by the
previous management. When the expected revenues failed to emerge, he said,
the airline had found itself unable to cover its costs.
The new management, Mr Peiser said, had changed strategy by concentrating on
costs. 'Our revenue forecast for next year is about flat with this year, and
yet we see substantial profitability because of the cost savings we already
have in place.'
TWA's problem is that all its credit facilities are drawn and it has
insufficient cash to pay its debts. If it is to stave off looming
bankruptcy, it has to persuade its creditors to swap their debt for equity.
Some analysts question whether creditors holding debt secured on the
airline's assets would be prepared to take such a risk.
But to address this difficulty, TWA is proposing to treat the various
classes of debt-holders differently, asking those with the least secured
debt to take the most equity.
The proposal is backed with a threat, too. TWA says that if some creditors
do not agree to the restructuring, it will file a pre-packaged bankruptcy
plan - one reached with the prior consent of some creditors - which would be
aimed at impairing the rights of those who held out against the
restructuring.
'It would be a tactical strike, a narrowly-focused option targeted at those
people who did not co-operate,' Mr Peiser said.
TWA would nevertheless need the support of at least two thirds of its
creditors before it could file such a plan. Over the next few weeks, it will
be campaigning hard in an attempt to secure it.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: SGS profits rise by 5.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS), the world's largest inspection and
testing group, said its pre-tax profits in the first eight months were up
5.5 per cent on a 3 per cent rise in fee income.
Mrs Elisabeth Salina, chairman of the Geneva based group, said operating
profits should continue to show 'satisfactory growth' in the full year,
although net income would rise to a lesser extent. No figures were given.
In the first eight months, fee income was up 10.5 per cent, expressed in
local currencies, of which 8 per cent came from internal growth. Fee income
rose 9.2 per cent in Europe and 18.4 per cent in North America.
The operating margin was in line with the 9 per cent achieved in the whole
of 1993. Net income rose in spite of lower financial revenues and a SFr10m
(Dollars 7.70m) provision for unrealised losses on securities.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ifil adds FFr1.5bn to Saint
Louis war chest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Saint Louis, the French food and paper group, is to strengthen its war chest
for possible acquisitions with a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) capital increase
reserved exclusively for Ifil, the industrial holding company of Italy's
powerful Agnelli family.
The deal is the result of an agreement earlier this year between Saint
Louis' two main shareholders - Ifil and Worms, the French holding group - to
equalise their stakes in the interest of exercising co-control of Saint
Louis.
The effect of the capital increase, which will be put to Saint Louis
shareholders on November 18, will be to raise the stake of the Agnelli
family holding in Saint Louis to 25.9 per cent from 15.7 per cent, while
that of Worms will fall to 27.8 per cent from 31.6 per cent.
The Saint Louis board will propose a three-for-one stock split at the
November 18 shareholders' meeting.
Mr Umberto Agnelli, chairman of Ifil, hailed the chance to raise his
investment in a food and paper group during a general upturn in the economy,
and said it would not require additional resources from Ifil. The latter is
paying half in cash and half in shares of Danone, the French food group
(formerly BSN), at the rate of two Danone shares for one Saint Louis share.
This will raise Saint Louis' stake in Danone to 3.8 per cent from 2.4 per
cent. Saint Louis ruled out any possibility that the group might use its new
resources to make a bid for Danone.
The French group said its war chest was put at FFr7bn with about a third in
cash, another third in Danone shares and a further third in Saint Louis'
Panzalim joint venture with Danone.
Even though it only helped create Panzalim in July, Saint Louis is
apparently ready to sell its 33.4 per cent stake in the venture if it needs
the money to fund an acquisition.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia fights ruling on
Telsystem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Telecom Italia, the Italian telecommunications operating company, is to
appeal against a court ruling earlier this week, forcing the group to open
its network to increased competition.
Telecom Italia said yesterday it favoured liberalisation of the sector, but
only if properly co-ordinated.
Milan's appeal court ruled on Monday that Telecom Italia had to provide
leased lines for Telsystem, a small Italian company seeking to sell telecoms
services to businesses, in competition with the main Italian operator.
Telsystem had argued that without such a provision, it risked going
bankrupt, because Telecom Italia had not leased sufficient lines to
construct a 'virtual' network for its clients.
The ruling is a temporary injunction, pending a decision on the case by
Italy's anti-trust authority on the substance of the case.
In theory, it is only a substitute for EU rules on the liberalisation of
telecom services, which were supposed to come into force throughout the
Community at the end of 1990, but have yet to be enacted by Italy. However,
according to Telsystem and its advisers it is a big step forward for those
who want to see Telecom Italia's monopoly broken up.
Ms Alessandra Perrazzelli, of Brosio, Casati e Associati, the lawyer
representing Telsystem, said yesterday: 'Of course, what we want is to win
the anti-trust case. But the importance of this ruling is two-fold. The
court is telling Sip (the domestic telephone monopoly) it can not go on with
the monopoly on lines, but (the ruling) is also very important because it
says you don't only have to give leased lines now, you have to give them in
the future.'
However, Mr Umberto Silvestri, chairman of Telecom Italia, said last night
that under the current state of Italian law 'there is no doubt that we have
a legitimate monopoly'.
If upheld, the ruling could add to the pressure on Telecom Italia and its
state-controlled parent company, Stet, which are already attempting to
manage a difficult programme of change.
The fusion earlier this year of five telecoms operators, including Sip, to
form Telecom Italia was part of this programme.
The Italian authorities are now preparing for the sale of their outstanding
shares in Stet, which should take place next year.
At the same time, Telecom Italia is having to adapt swiftly to the 1998
deadline set by the Community for opening up ordinary telephone calls to
competition.
Between 1992 and 1998, Telecom Italia is set to spend more than L50,000bn
(Dollars 31bn) on investment, which includes modernising the Italian network
for the coming multimedia technology.
At the same time, the group must continue to rebalance its tariffs to fall
in line with international competition. Mr Silvestri estimates that domestic
telephone charges in Italy will have to rise by 25 per cent, while
international charges - among the highest in Europe - may have to fall by
about the same amount.
More urgently, Italy's state telecoms companies are searching for a partner,
to give themselves a place alongside other European competitors, such as
France Telecom and British Telecom, many of which have struck defensive
deals with global operators such as AT&amp;T of the US.
Mr Silvestri says the search for a global alliance is a priority, and adds
that Telecom Italia is negotiating with 'three or four' companies. 'We have
to find a medium-sized operator - not large, because we don't want to be
choked,' he says.
He is hoping the form of Stet's privatisation will be decided soon, because
uncertainty could delay the conclusion of such talks.
Advisers to the sell-off should be named shortly, and the government will
have to decide, with their assistance, whether and how to limit foreign
control of Stet, for example, by retaining a golden share, or forming an
Italian-dominated hard core of investors.
Telecom Italia's second priority, according to its new chairman, is to adapt
a bureaucratic management to the forthcoming changes.
'Our managing class is very high-calibre, but it's a class which has managed
a monopoly for 60 years,' says Mr Silvestri, himself a long-serving
executive in the state sector. 'Between 1994 and 1998, we have to change the
culture: a large company has to become a competitive company.'
In this respect, this week's decision by the Milan court of appeal could
provide an incentive to accelerate those changes, even if the business
represented by leased lines only represents an estimated 5 per cent of
Telecom Italia's total domestic turnover.

FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust hits back in
derivatives case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust yesterday hit out against a claim that it was responsible for
losses of Dollars 20m suffered by a customer arising from derivative
instruments.
In papers filed in the district court in Cincinnati, the US bank claimed it
had fully briefed executives of the company, Gibson Greetings, on the risks
associated with the instruments.
Gibson, which lost Dollars 20m on interest rate swap contracts it bought
from Bankers Trust, claimed in a suit filed last month that the bank had
misled it about the risks.
The bank said yesterday that Gibson had bought the derivatives with full
knowledge of how they would behave if the markets moved against the company.
Gibson rejected offers from Bankers Trust on 10 separate occasions to end
the contracts, a move which would have limited the company's losses, the
bank added.
The case is seen as a test of whether corporate treasurers can claim to have
been unsuspecting victims when complex financial instruments they bought
turn sour. Procter &amp; Gamble, which earlier this year lost Dollars 157m on
interest rate swaps it bought from Bankers Trust, has yet to file a suit but
is watching the Gibson case with interest.
Bankers Trust said it had not acted as an adviser to Gibson, and the company
had made its own decisions about the risks it was running when buying the
swaps. The bank said it had been informed that Mr William Flaherty, the
company's chief financial officer, had consulted Gibson's board before
entering the two swap contracts which the company is now trying to
repudiate.
'Gibson knew that it was taking a position as to the direction that interest
rates might move and that (it) would suffer losses if its predictions were
wrong,' according to the court papers. The losses arose as US interest rates
rose, rather than falling as Gibson had expected.
Gibson came under attack yesterday from accountants Arthur Andersen, sacked
as the company's auditor last month. Andersen said there had been a
'deliberate attempt' by Cleo, a Gibson subsidiary, to inflate pre-tax income
by overstating the value of inventory. The company was not immediately
available for comment.

<TEXT>
Postipankki, the state-owned Finnish banking group, yesterday reported
sharply deeper losses in the first eight months compared with the same
period last year as falling income from financial operations and rising
costs eclipsed a promising decline in credit losses.
Operating losses mounted to FM463m (Dollars 85.7m) compared with a loss of
FM66m in the first eight months of 1993. Mr Seppo Lindblom, chief executive,
said the result was worse than expected and warned of further losses.
Net income from financial operations tumbled by FM361m to FM1.42bn due to
lower-than-anticipated returns from treasury operations. The bank said it
was 'not entirely successful' in predicting domestic and international
market trends and had incurred heavy bond trading losses. These included a
FM237m loss on Finnish government bonds for which Postipankki is a market
maker.
Group expenses jumped to FM1.85bn from FM1.43bn mainly due to costs
associated with Postipankki's takeover in 1993 of a one-fourth share of the
Savings Bank of Finland.
