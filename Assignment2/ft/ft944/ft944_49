FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ebner denies seeking control of
UBS

<TEXT>
BK Vision, the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland, has denied
UBS charges that it is trying to take control of the bank and close its
large retail business.
UBS has called an extraordinary shareholders' meeting for November 22 to
approve its plan to convert the bank's registered shares into bearer shares,
thereby eliminating their extra voting power.
BK Vision, an investment company controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking
group, holds over 18 per cent of the registered shares.
If the board motion succeeded, the premium on the registered shares, now
more than 20 per cent on the bearer shares, would disappear. This would
result in large losses for registered shareholders.
Mr Ebner said BK Vision could not gain control of the bank because of
restrictions limiting individual registered shareholders to voting a maximum
of 5 per cent of the voting capital. He denied UBS charges that he was
putting together a concert party of shareholders.
However, he believed that a majority of UBS shareholders could soon be
attracted to BK's ideas for managing the bank.
Last spring, BK won 40 per cent of the votes at the UBS annual meeting for
its motion to reduce the number of directors from 22 to a maximum of nine.
Mr Ebner said most of the votes against him were proxies held by the board,
providing grounds for his optimism on future motions.
He described charges that BK wanted UBS to abandon its retail banking
business as 'grossly overblown'. The bank needed a strong refinancing base
in Switzerland for its investment banking business, he said.
BK's aim since its formation in late 1991 was to to make UBS more sensitive
to shareholder interests, notably a higher return on equity.
It was disappointed with the results to date and with the board's negative
reaction to its suggestions, and so it had become more aggressive.
BK opposed the elimination of the registered shares and would demand that
registered shareholders have the right to vote separately on the motion. UBS
claims that a two-third majority of all votes and a simple majority of the
capital would suffice.
BK has proposed that Mr Walter Frey, a Zurich motor dealer, be elected to
the UBS board to represent registered shareholders.
Mr Frey is a political colleague of Mr Christoph Blocher in the conservative
Swiss People's Party. Mr Blocher is a close business associate of Mr Ebner.
Mr Ebner said there were several avenues of legal action open to BK if the
UBS board's plan to eliminate the registered shares carried at the EGM.

Ipeco Holdings, the maker of specialist products for the aviation and

Mr Christopher Johnson, chairman, said the results reflected conditions in

reached last autumn.
He also announced the award of a contract for the supply of crew seats to
the new 737-700 range of airliners, which, he said, firmly cemented the
long-term relationship with Boeing.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 9.47m (Pounds 10.6m). The interim dividend is

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gardner Merchant rises 14% - Market
conditions 'not encouraging' for catering group's flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardner Merchant, the largest contract caterer in Europe, yesterday reported
an increase of almost 14 per cent in interim profits.
The group, bought by the management from Forte for Pounds 402m at the end of
1992, made profits before interest and tax of Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 23.7m) in
the six months to July 31 on the back of a 9 per cent rise in turnover to
Pounds 556m (Pounds 509m).
Mr Garry Hawkes, chief executive, said the group was under no pressure to
float. 'Our investors are happy with their returns, and clearly the current
market conditions are not very encouraging.'
Group debt stands at Pounds 220m after a refinancing deal in the summer with
the Royal Bank of Scotland and five other banks.
Growth during in the half year was all organic, with a net gain of 175
contracts, compared with 163 previously.
The group relies on the UK for more than half its business and most of its
profits. UK profits grew to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 17.2m) on sales of Pounds
320m (Pounds 291m).
Almost a third of new contracts in the UK, where margins improved from 5.9
to 6.2 per cent, were in the public sector - an area the group has targeted
for future growth both in the UK and overseas.
In the rest of Europe profits edged ahead to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.2m) on
sales of Pounds 152m (Pounds 141m), held back by the recession in France.
European margins eased to 3.6 per cent (3.7 per cent). Profits from the rest
of the world, including the US, were Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.3m) on sales of
Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 77.2m).
The current half will include for the first time the group's five
acquisitions made this year for a total of Pounds 72.9m - the main one being
the Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m) purchase of part of Morrison Restaurants'
contract food division in the US.
This doubled the size of the group's US business and made it fifth biggest
in the US market.
Employees who use their staff restaurant are benefiting from a perk worth at
least Pounds 300 a year and in today's tough economic climate more employees
than ever are eating company food, according to an employee catering survey
conducted by the Industrial Society and Touche Ross Management Consultants.
The average subsidy per user of company canteen facilities is Pounds 328.90
a year and more than 50 per cent of employees are now using catering
services, the survey found.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W signals priorities with China
partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's breakthrough by Cable and Wireless into China may mark a turning
point in the strategy of the UK telecommunications group.
Although the precise terms of the Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) agreement to
develop telecoms networks in partnership with China's ministry of posts and
telecommunications remain to be finalised, C&amp;W left no room for doubt that
Asia would be its prime investment focus for the next decade.
C&amp;W has operations across the world, but Hongkong Telecom - of which C&amp;W
owns 57.5 per cent - has long been the jewel in its crown.
Last year Asia accounted for nearly half of the company's Pounds 4.7bn
turnover, and Hong Kong alone for 64 per cent of its operating profit. By
contrast, in the highly competitive UK market, C&amp;W's turnover (through its
Mercury subsidiary) was three quarters that in Hong Kong, yet its operating
profit was less than a third as great.
Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said: 'When you ask what
differentiates us from others you always come back to Asia; and now that we
have this tangible evidence of the opportunities in China, it will clearly
be a priority.'
The 'first call' on resources 'will tend to be Asia'.
The Chinese deal represents about two thirds of Hongkong Telecoms's total
capital investment last year. Spread over three years, it represents about a
25 per cent annual increase, and more could be in store.
'The arrangement with the MPT (Chinese telecoms ministry) is very fluid, and
further opportunities could well be available, even at this stage,' said Mr
Ross.
Mr Andrew Harrington, Asian telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong
Kong, said the deal 'strengthens Hongkong Telecom's premier position in
China, and is bound to make China C&amp;W's most important new sphere of
activity for the foreseeable future.'
However, C&amp;W said yesterday it had no intention of withdrawing from other
regions. Last week the Bouygues consortium, in which C&amp;W has a 20 per cent
stake, won the licence to build France's third mobile phone network, with
plans to invest about FFr11.7bn (Pounds 1.4bn) over 10 years.
C&amp;W is investing heavily in its mobile venture in the UK, and has a stake in
a German mobile phone operator which may enter the fixed-wire sector as
European telecoms are opened to further competition. C&amp;W intends to expand
in the Caribbean and US.
Balancing commitments and opportunities is thus a critical challenge for
C&amp;W. It is not only a question of balance between regions but also within
regions. 'Even in Asia, we are not putting all our eggs into the Chinese
basket,' Mr Ross stressed, pointing to C&amp;W's operations in Australia and its
ambitions in Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.
Mr Ross believes the group could comfortably increase expenditure by between
Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn a year, given its low gearing. But that could be
swallowed up in China alone if the state monopoly dam has truly burst.

<TEXT>
Pilkington is buying out minority shareholders in its Finnish float glass
subsidiary, enabling it to complete the integration of its European float
glass production lines.
The UK glass group is paying FM69.6m (Pounds 9m) in shares for the remaining
29 per cent of Lahden Lasitehdas. The stake is currently owned by Finnish
institutions.
Pilkington took a 50 per cent stake in Lahden Lasitehdas in 1978, which it
increased to 71 per cent in 1988 when the Finnish government sold a 33 per
cent holding for Pounds 6m.
Pilkington is streamlining production between its nine European float plants
in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Finland. All the others are wholly owned.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lewis resigns Technology chair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Derek Lewis, chairman of Technology, is leaving the personal computer
distributorship at the end of the year after some 18 months of strife and
unhappiness among staff and customers.
Technology, which is owned by ICL and is one of the UK's largest pc
distributors, is unlikely to make a profit for the year although it is
currently trading in the black, according to Mr Ninian Eadie, in charge of
ICL's volume products division.
Mr Lewis denied that he was leaving in any mood of bitterness, however. He
is moving to Schroder Ventures where he will take a role in determining the
group's electronics and computers investment policy.
He said yesterday that Technology was now firmly established as part of the
ICL structure and ready for its next expansion phase. 'I think I have done
my job and now it is time to move on.'
The new chairman will be Mr Ken Wallace, deputy chairman and logistics
director. Ms Marie-Anne van Ingen, sales director, becomes managing
director.
ICL's take over of Technology is 1992 was seen as a bold experiment for a
former mainframe computer manufacturer in the low cost distribution of pcs.
It failed to work as planned, however, because Technology proved unable to
handle the volume of business on its own and earlier this year ICL put a new
organisation, ICL Client-Server Systems, in place to supply pcs and midrange
machines to dealers and systems houses.
Now Technology operates at arms-length to ICL, distributing computers from a
range of manufacturers: 'It is very much back to basics' Mr Eadie said
yesterday.
Mr Lewis led the management buy-out of Technology and its subsequent sale to
ICL. There was speculation in the industry yesterday that if ICL was
prepared to sell Technology, Mr Lewis would be well placed with Schroders to
help with financial matters.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: NW Water sells Malaysian stake
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water is to swap a 20 per cent stake in Malaysia's Indah Water
Konsortium for a holding in Indah Water Operations, a separately formed
operating company which has exclusive rights to maintain and operate the
assets of IWK.
The deal, which will leave North West with a 5 per cent holding in IWK,
would enhance the overall strength of the group's position in Malaysia,
directors said.
Under the terms of the transaction North West has agreed to sell the 20 per
cent stake to the Berjaya Group, one of its co-investors in IWK.
Consideration is Pounds 7m, the par value of the holding plus Pounds 1m. In
addition, North West has agreed to a 'deeprooted alliance' with Berjaya,
focusing on developing clean water opportunities in Malaysia and
establishing a manufacturing/ distribution base.
The two are also to create a jointly-owned company, based in Hong Kong, to
exploit opportunities in water and waste water in mainland China.
Berjaya South Island, a listed company, has offered to purchase all the
shares in IWK. That offer has been accepted by 80 per cent of the
shareholders, including North West.
In consideration for the disposal of its remaining 5 per cent stake in IWK,
North West will take equivalent stock in BSouth, which will be renamed Prime
Utilities.
The BSouth proposals are subject to approvals by the Malaysian government
and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, as well as shareholders. This process
could take up to six months.
IWK was six months ago awarded the contract by the government of Dr Mahathir
Mohamad to upgrade and construct a nationwide sewerage system.
Berjaya associated companies, controlled by Malaysian Chinese entrepreneur
Mr Vincent Tan, had a 35 per cent stake in Indah. North West had 25 per cent
and funds associated with Malaysia's army and police force had 20 per cent
each.
At the time opposition groups accused the government of favouritism towards
Mr Tan and Berjaya. However, criticism was somewhat mollified by the broad
composition of the Indah consortium.
Mr Bob Ferguson, North West's finance director, said the restructuring was
being undertaken because the Malaysian government wished to see ownership of
the recently privatised water operations vested in local publicly traded
companies.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lotus returns to the black with Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Group Lotus, the UK sports car maker and engineering group taken over last
year from General Motors by Bugatti International of Italy, yesterday
announced its return to profitability after an extended period of losses
under GM ownership.
The company, which currently employs 950 people at its Hethel, Norfolk,
operations, is now on course to fund a new small sports car planned for 1996
from its own resources after achieving a Pounds 12.3m turn-round to record
an unaudited net profit of Pounds 2m, Mr Adrian Palmer, managing director,
said last night.
Bugatti bought Lotus from GM for a reputed Pounds 30m and said as recently
as June that it intended to raise more than Pounds 100m to fund Bugatti and
Lotus development through a flotation on the New York Stock Exchange.
So far, this has not been proceeded with and Mr Palmer said yesterday that
Lotus would now need additional funding only for a larger sports model also
being planned for the late 1990s.
Lotus's transition to profit from a Pounds 10.3m net loss in its financial
year to August was based on turnover 22 per cent higher at Pounds 50.8m.
Sales of the Esprit, its large sports car, rose 45 per cent from 246 units
to 360, and 84 Elan small sports cars were sold after the resumption of
production earlier this year.
While Lotus plans to build a similar number of Esprits in the current year,
it is scheduled to build a total of 800 Elans by mid-1995 as a limited
production run, after which it will be preparing to produce the new small
sports car. This, too, is scheduled for output of 800 units a year starting
in early 1996.
However the bulk of Lotus's turnover - about 60 per cent - came last year
from engineering consultancy work. This rose 7 per cent in value to Pounds
25.1m and Pounds 43m of new orders have been received in the past 12 months,
said Mr Palmer.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant recruitment market boosts BNB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BNB Resources, the recruitment, training and consumer communications group,
yesterday announced sharply increased first half profits as it consolidated
the recovery shown in 1993.
Mr David Norman, chairman, said that continuing increased demand across the
group's activities was behind the pre-tax line improving from Pounds 344,000
to Pounds 1.38m for the half year to June 30. Turnover rose 33 per cent to
Pounds 42.2m.
The human resources recruitment side lifted its contribution to operating
profits by 73 per cent to Pounds 3.07m. The senior management and
professional recruitment market displayed a solid improvement in the UK, Mr
Norman said, with Norman Broadbent's revenue ahead 31 per cent. In the US,
income at NBI rose 39 per cent, helped by the Chicago office coming on
stream. Mr Norman praised an 'outstanding' performance from NBI Hong Kong
with 'business booming' at its new Beijing office with revenue more than
doubled.
NB Selection, which specialises in management recruitment, has expanded from
its UK base on to the Continent with offices opening in Paris and Madrid.
Revenue jumped 63 per cent, outperforming a market showing volume growth of
about 30 per cent.
Margins on the training side remained under pressure, with the seasonal
operating deficit widening from Pounds 395,000 to Pounds 721,000. Market
share had improved, however, and Mr Norman anticipated an advance on last
year's overall profit of Pounds 497,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 4.2p (1.1p); the interim dividend goes up to
1.77p (1.6p).

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Capital and Regional leaps to Pounds 1.24m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Capital and Regional Properties reported sharply higher pre-tax profits for
the six months to June 24, during which just under Pounds 50m was spent on
acquisitions.
The USM-quoted property investment company raised the figure from Pounds
151,000 to Pounds 1.24m. This included a contribution of Pounds 281,000 from
R Green Properties, covering the 11 weeks since its acquisition for Pounds
33.4m in April, when a Pounds 25.3m rights issue was also completed.
Net rental income came to Pounds 2.95m (Pounds 3.38m). Other income added
Pounds 807,000 (Pounds 72,000) and the net interest charge declined to
Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 2.25m).
The interim dividend is raised to 0.6p (0.5p) on earnings per share of 2.85p
(0.2p).
Shareholders' funds at June 24 stood at Pounds 76.8m, against Pounds 49.6m
at December 25 1993. Net assets per share were 168.5p (163.8p at the year
end).
Mr Martin Barber, chairman, said Centrepoint Properties Corporation, the
former subsidiary now quoted separately in the US, had performed in line
with expectations. Capital and Regional owns 20 per cent of the common stock
in Centrepoint.
The company plans to move to the main market once the accounts for 1994 have
been published.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Cash piles can grow too big for comfort -
Peggy Hollinger doubts wisdom of share buy-backs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity investors have pocketed more than Pounds 750m over the last 10
months as the regional power companies have rushed to buy back their own
shares.
The bonanza comes to a temporary halt next week as the last of the 12
regional electricity companies enters its closed period in advance of
interim results. This means that neither the company nor its directors may
deal in shares until the results are made public.
While only nine of the 12 recs have actually bought shares from investors,
all have received shareholders' approval to repurchase up to 10 per cent, or
more in the case of one company: Eastern, which led the way with the first
buy-back in January, has permission to repurchase up to 14.9 per cent.
The companies argue that the raft of share buy-backs has been prompted by a
desire to return value to shareholders. With the simple act of buying shares
for cancellation, the recs are able to improve their earnings. It has been
estimated that if all the recs bought back 10 per cent of their equity, the
sector's earnings could improve by about 6 per cent.
This is a low risk way of enhancing value, say the recs, and of using the
rapidly growing cash piles generated by the regulated businesses.
In reality, however, the cash mountains are uncomfortable luxuries as the
utilities face increasing political pressure to return value not just to
shareholders, but also to customers.
SG Warburg, the London broker, has estimated that the 12 recs are on their
way to building a net Pounds 2.7bn cash mountain by the end of the decade.
Such pressures have also increased fears that the electricity companies
could become the targets of a one-off tax, either when the National Grid is
spun off next year or at a change of government.
'The regional electricity companies have been busily trying to find money to
spend to get their balance sheets geared up to such a degree that it will
prevent them being stuffed with debt by the government,' said one analyst.
Meanwhile, shareholders were not likely to be satisfied with companies
sitting on large cash piles at a time of low interest rates. Yet neither
would they be happy with widespread diversification, given the poor track
record that utilities have outside their core businesses.
So the question was, how best to use the cash and return value to
shareholders?
Paying a special one-off dividend, or even a substantially higher one, could
present difficulties. 'You have to be sensitive to the public and political
issues,' said one industry executive. 'If you paid a huge increase in
dividend, what sort of reaction would that produce?'
Repurchases also allow the recs to sidestep the increased dividend problem.
Eastern set another trend by increasing its dividend 20 per cent after the
first buy-back. Yet because there were fewer shares in issue, the total sum
paid out was no greater than the previous year. The other recs are expected
to follow Eastern's suit.
However, not all the companies agree that buying back shares now is the best
way to enhance value for shareholders. Three - East Midlands, Southern and
Yorkshire - have chosen not to buy shares. At least two are waiting for the
outcome of discussions on the future of the National Grid, the transmission
company owned by the recs estimated to be worth at least Pounds 4bn.
The manner in which this is spun off could have substantial financial
implications for the recs, and for shareholders: for example, in the advance
corporation tax burden which the companies will have to carry in case of a
distribution to shareholders. There is also the added fear that the
companies could face a potential capital gains tax bill of more than Pounds
1bn on a Grid flotation. Until all the facts are known, these companies
argue, it is impossible to decide on the best way to return value to
shareholders.
The abstainers would also argue that some share buy-backs give the greatest
benefit to a select group of investors. If the buy-backs are conducted
through an agent - as in the case of the two recs who bought 10 per cent -
eligible sellers could claim tax credits. While all investors would benefit
from improved earnings, only a few could reclaim the credit, estimated at an
average 150p a share.
Such concerns do not mean that these abstainers will stay out of the market
forever. Far from it. 'We have the power to do it and it is just a matter of
timing,' said one industry executive.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists 17% ahead - Largest gains
achieved in pharmaceuticals and veterinary products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Chemists, the UK's second largest pharmaceuticals retailer, lifted
both profits and turnover by 17 per cent for the year to the end of June,
helped by large sales gains in the pharmaceuticals and veterinary divisions.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 49.7m to Pounds 58.3m, while sales expanded
from Pounds 802m to Pounds 940m. The latest profits included an exceptional
gain of Pounds 2.81m from disposals.
Earnings per share rose from 28.5p to 33.67p. The board is proposing to
increase the final dividend from 5.25p to 6.8p, raising the total by 31 per
cent to 9.5p (7.25p).
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the record results had been achieved in the
fourth year of a recession characterised by negligible inflation, fragile
consumer confidence and a very competitive retail climate.
'We have no declining markets, all our divisions are profitable, and all are
moving forward,' he said.
The shares rose by 16p to 299p.
Sales in the retail division, which includes the chains of more than 900
chemist shops and some 300 Holland &amp; Barrett healthfood shops, were 5.5 per
cent ahead to Pounds 601m (Pounds 569m). Profits rose from Pounds 44.9m to
Pounds 49.5m.
The group said the healthcare market was continuing to grow, with increasing
NHS business and buoyant over the counter sales. The group describes itself
as the leading neighbourhood pharmacy chain, with most shops near doctors'
surgeries.
It has won the NHS contract to distribute 14.3m rubella vaccinations in the
government campaign to treat all child-ren between five and 16 years old.
The pharmaceuticals division increased sales by 49 per cent from Pounds 184m
to Pounds 274m and lifted profits from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 13m. The
increases reflected acquisitions in Scotland, where it is now the leading
distributor, and in Northern Ireland, a new market for the group, as well as
organic growth.
Profits at the veterinary division rose from Pounds 2.08m to Pounds 3.54m on
the back of a 32 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds 49.2m to Pounds
65.1m.
Mr Lloyd said the group would 'do even better in future', adding that first
quarter sales in the retail division were 8 per cent higher, while the
pharmaceutical and veterinary divisions were 39 per cent and 47 per cent
higher respectively.
While he did not rule out further acquisitions completely, he said he would
be happy for the group to grow organically.
COMMENT
It is becoming increasingly difficult to be a bear on these shares. Chemist
shops are a low risk business as licence requirements make it difficult to
open new branches. The policy of issuing shares to mop up competitors, much
criticised at the time, now looks like good strategy. The group has made no
large acquisitions for a couple of years, and has consistently delivered
results in line with expectations. Gearing is 31 per cent - by no means
excessive - and interest cover is a healthy 14.6 times. A dividend of 11.5p
this year gives a prospective yield of 4.8 per cent, while forecast profits
of Pounds 62m leave the prospective multiple at about 9. AAH and UniChem -
the companies most often held up for comparison - are on multiples of 14.1
and 15 respectively.

yesterday warned that profits would be hit by a Pounds 2.4m charge to pay
for a reorganisation of its British operations.
The announcement follows the company's warning in August that full year
profits were expected to fall in 1994. Difficulties in both dry cleaning and
textile rentals led analysts to rein in profits estimates at the time from
Pounds 18m to Pounds 17m.
Mr Terry Greer, chairman, said yesterday's statement was not a profits
warning. It was instead a positive step to enable the company to 'improve a
lot faster', he said. 'We are confident that all the steps we are taking
will have a positive effect on trading next year.'
The reorganisation would mean the loss of up to 100 jobs, including some
senior managers. Johnson would also step up the closure of 50 marginal dry
cleaning shops.
The actions would result in savings of about Pounds 500,000 a year, Mr Greer
said.
From the beginning of next year, Johnson's textile rentals and dry cleaning
businesses would be run as separate companies.
Managing directors have been appointed to both divisions and the textile
rental business would trade under the name Apparelmaster UK. Johnson is the
fourth largest garment rental operator in the UK.
A specialised and focused management would allow the businesses to respond
more quickly to pressures and opportunities, said Mr Greer. 'We would like
to expand by acquisition again and this way we will be able to do so much
more quickly.'
Mr Greer said trading in the dry cleaning business had not improved since
the warning in August. On a brighter note, 'steps have been taken recently
to reduce the overhead costs of the lossmaking franchise dry cleaning
business in the US,' he said. 'It is expected that this business will break
even in 1995.' Analysts have estimated that the US franchise business had
been losing about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year.
The shares closed up 1p at 256p.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Owen &amp; Robinson expands via Pro Performance
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Owen &amp; Robinson, the jewellery and sports footwear retailer, has agreed to
acquire 38 leasehold outlets from SSL Retail, a subsidiary of Sears, the
speciality retail and home shopping group.
Consideration will amount to a maximum of Pounds 1.06m cash, satisfied from
existing resources.
The outlets operate under the Pro Performance banner, and currently sell
sports clothing and equipment, as well as footwear. They will be integrated
into Owen &amp; Robinson's existing Foothold operation, raising the chain to 53
outlets and extending its presence nation-wide.
Mr Liam Strong, Sears chief executive, said the sale would reduce the
group's exposure to the sports footwear market 'which continues to decline'
and allow it to concentrate on its Olympus offshoot.
Sears will book a loss on disposal of some Pounds 5.8m although this will be
more than offset by the release of provisions no longer required.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Northern Rock establishes indemnity
insurance offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Rock, the 11th largest building society with assets of Pounds
7.2bn, yesterday announced that it had established its own 'captive' company
to provide mortgage indemnity insurance.
Northern Rock is the latest society to take advantage of a relaxation of
restrictions by the Building Societies Commission last year. This allowed
societies to own more than 15 per cent of a non-life insurance company.
Indemnity insurance protects lenders against repossession losses by making
up the deficit if a property has to be sold for less than 75 per cent of its
purchase price. This was common in the early 1990s.
Northern Rock's move to provide indemnity insurance through a Guernsey-based
company with initial authorised capital of Pounds 8.5m comes after it
switched indemnity insurance from Sun Alliance to Commercial Union last
year.
The investment manager for the captive insurance company will be Kleinwort
Benson (Guernsey), and it will be regulated by the Guernsey Financial
Services Commission.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Team Aer Lingus out of examinership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MACMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Team Aer Lingus, the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of Ireland's national
airline, has come out of examinership after its trade unions accepted new
work practices.
An examiner, the Irish equivalent of an administrator, was appointed to Team
Aer Lingus two weeks ago after its parent refused to advance it any more
funds following unions' rejection of proposals on more efficient work
practices. The unions then reballoted members and the proposals were
accepted, leading to renewed support from Aer Lingus for the subsidiary,
which lost IPounds 32m on turnover of IPounds 86m last year.
Team Aer Lingus has started to re-employ some of the 1,138 workers - out of
1,900 - laid off since the industrial dispute began five months ago. It is
not expected to return to profit for at least two years.

FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Luxury sales help Time Prods to Pounds 4.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group, lifted both
turnover and profits, excluding exceptional items, by almost a quarter in
the six months to July 31.
Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said yesterday he was pleased with the
results and confident about the future. 'Rich people will always buy, but
you have to have the things they want.'
In the pipeline was 'the most complicated pocket watch ever made,' which
would have 11 hands and movements on both sides and sell for more than
Pounds 500,000.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.69m, against Pounds 5.33m last time, when
profits on disposals totalled Pounds 1.48m.
Total turnover rose from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 37.2m, including a Pounds
2.05m contribution from the Swiss distribution of Audemars Piguet, the Swiss
watchmaker. Time, which already has the North American distribution rights,
paid Pounds 2.5m cash and assumed Pounds 2.5m of debt to buy the Swiss
rights last March.
Mr Margulies described sales of luxury watches, which can be priced at up to
Pounds 500,000, as satisfactory, with Audemars Piguet sales in North America
exceeding expectations.
The group, which holds agencies for seven luxury watchmakers, including
Blancpain and Vacheron Constantin, sold 10 pieces at more than Pounds
100,000 in the half.
Last year the group acquired Judith Leiber, the American designer of luxury
handbags and evening bags which retail at between Dollars 1,200 and Dollars
4,000. It is planning to develop the brand, adding costume jewellery and
other accessories.
Luxury items made up 70 per cent of operating profits, compared with 30 per
cent from the volume operations, including Sekonda watches.
The cost of buying the Swiss rights to Audemars Piguet and lower rates
reduced interest income from Pounds 513,000 to Pounds 138,000 and left the
group marginally geared. But profits are skewed to Christmas and the second
half, and the group expects to be cash positive by January.
Earnings were 5.85p (6.67p). The interim dividend is raised by 0.25p to
3.25p.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Babycham at home with Old England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Babycham, Olde English Cider and Concorde British wine, three of Britain's
best-known drinks brands, were yesterday sold as part of the takeover of
Gaymer Group Europe by Matthew Clark.
The move will give Clark, which boasts Warninks advocaat and Stones Ginger
Wine among its own brands, nearly 90 per cent of the domestically produced
fortified wine market through the merger of its Old England products and
Gaymer's QC range.
Including Gaymer's debts, which will be repaid, the deal is worth Pounds
109m. The deal is to be funded through a rights issue, Clark's third in 18
months, in a move which will more than double its share base to 45.8m
shares.
The three-for-five issue at 500p a share will raise Pounds 64.4m, most of
which will be used to repay Gaymer's Pounds 53.5m of debt. Clark shares
yesterday closed down 36p at 589p.
The Pounds 55.6m balance of the purchase price will be paid through the
issue of Clark shares to venture capital investors, who hold about 94 per
cent of Gaymer.
Gaymer made pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.1m in the year to February 28
against Pounds 8.6m the previous year. Turnover rose from Pounds 135.7m to
Pounds 143.3m. For the year to July 31, Clark made profits of Pounds 10.3m
on turnover of Pounds 174m.
Gaymer, which was subject to a Pounds 105m management buy-out two years ago,
had been expected to float on the stock market later this year, and
yesterday's move took industry analysts by surprise.
Sources among the venture capitalists said the decision was taken against
the background of a price war in the cider market which had contributed to a
slowdown in earnings at Gaymer.
There were also concerns over the company's management: the chief executive
stepped aside earlier this year and two other directors left.
Another trade offer was made, rumoured to be from Taunton Cider. Clark said
it believed there would be no referral to the Office of Fair Trading.
Mr Michael Cotterill, chairman of both Taunton and Matthew Clark, yesterday
resigned from his post at Taunton, citing a conflict of interest given
Gaymer's cider operations.
Both Mr Cotterill and the company yesterday refused further comment.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Defence giants go to battle stations for the Great Game: The
desire of BAe and GEC to win VSEL reflects a wider conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With British Aerospace and GEC mobilising for a tug of love over VSEL, the
submarine maker, the real battle has begun for the future of the UK defence
industry. The number of defence contractors is shrinking rapidly, and the
choices left to companies wishing to merge and cut their costs are narrowing
fast.
Competition over any defence company up for grabs is likely to be fierce.
BAe would apparently have liked to buy helicopter-maker Westland when GKN
bid earlier this year, had GKN not started with an almost unstoppable
shareholding.
Now the attention has switched from air to sea systems. BAe wants to be the
project manager which controls the key contracts in ships as well as
aircraft. GEC, tired of its role as a supplier to BAe, is keen to expand its
naval presence and become a larger full-scale project manager in its own
right.
VSEL will go to one or the other. GEC has the advantage of being able to bid
in cash, while BAe does not face the competition difficulty of owning two
shipyards. The proximity of two large naval contracts - a Pounds 2.5bn order
for Trafalgar hunter-killer submarines and a Pounds 500m order for landing
ships - could make VSEL an attractive proposition.
But Britain's other small defence contractors are on their guard. There is a
great deal of common ground between the mid-life refitting of nuclear
submarines, which will soon be done exclusively at Devonport in Plymouth,
and their construction.
It would make sense for whoever owns VSEL to own Devonport, which is due to
be privatised over the next 18 months, the same timescale on which the
Trafalgar order will be placed.
Land systems - tanks and armoured personnel carriers - are also spread among
a wide range of companies and could be rationalised, too.
Some deals may seem to create strange bedfellows. Yet in the absence of
pan-European mergers, companies are having to find their savings where they
can. Several of the large US deals, most notably Lockheed's merger with
Martin Marietta, have also brought together companies with little in common
but their defence interests.
Savings on central overheads and the ability to manage defence contracts and
ministries skilfully are the strongest arguments in favour of the deals.
Savings will be generated whichever company wins VSEL. Central overheads
will be reduced and design and marketing teams consolidated. There are also
management gains to be made. Project management in defence is a particularly
black art and one which BAe in particular has practised well.
If either BAe or GEC can teach VSEL how to become a risk-taking prime
contractor managing a Pounds 2.5bn fixed-price order for Trafalgar
submarines, then the merged companies, and the ministry of defence, should
benefit.
The endgame, however, leaves BAe and GEC staring awkwardly at each other
over the chessboard. Resolving the BAe-GEC issue is going to be the Great
Game of the next decade.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Pru may buy stake in Thai insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance company, is holding talks about
its first significant acquisition in the Asian insurance market, a 24.9 per
cent stake in Thai Sethakit Life Assurance.
TS Life is the second smallest of the 12 Thai insurance companies and has a
market share of about 1 per cent. Its market capitalisation is Pounds 37m.
Rules in Thailand do not allow Prudential to acquire a stake of more than 25
per cent in TS Life.
Morgan Grenfell Thai Company, financial adviser to TS Life, said existing
shareholders had provisionally agreed to sell their shares at Bt65 each and
that the sale should be completed next month.
If it is, Prudential will provide TS Life with technical support,
international expertise, new product development, computer systems,
training, marketing and management skills.
TS Life noted that the Thai insurance market has experienced recent growth
of more than 20 per cent a year. 'With increasing pressure to liberalise the
Thai insurance market, we believe TS Life is now well positioned to compete
with new foreign entrants to the market and to expand as the market
develops. Expansion into regional markets is also a possibility,' it said.
Mr Mick Newmarch, Prudential's chief executive, has identified Asia as one
of the key growth areas for the company. Most of its expansion in the
region, however, has been through organic growth of long-standing operations
in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company has also
entered the Malaysian market.
Last year, Prudential opened an investment management office in Hong Kong to
handle regional investment activities. It has also opened three
representative offices in China - in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. This
is the first step towards obtaining licences to sell insurance products in
China.
According to Prudential's annual report, Asian activities are providing some
of the most rapid growth of all its operations. New premium income from Hong
Kong in 1993 rose 43 per cent from the 1992 level, while that from Singapore
rose 18 per cent.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Mitsubishi's Dollars 2bn rescue of trust bank breaks
barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERARD BAKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mitsubishi Bank, one of the world's largest commercial banks, yesterday
announced a rescue takeover of the troubled Nippon Trust Bank. The deal is a
move towards the consolidation of a Japanese banking sector crippled by bad
debts.
Mitsubishi will become the first Japanese city bank, or commercial bank, to
operate a full trust bank subsidiary. It said it would buy Y200bn (Pounds
1.3bn) of new shares, giving it a 68.8 per cent stake in Nippon Trust from
November 10. It is already the second largest shareholder, with 5 per cent.
Nippon Trust has been struggling under the weight of bad loans made during
the boom years of the late 1980s, when property and other asset prices rose
sharply. It acknowledged that non-performing loans, brought about by the
subsequent decline in the property market, were now far higher than the
official figure of Y130bn disclosed in May. Industry sources put the actual
figure as high as Y500bn.
Nippon Trust plans immediately to write off Y200bn of those loans, producing
a collapse in profits in the current fiscal year, according to its
president, Mr Tomoaki Hirano.
In the year to March 1995, it would record a net loss of Y163bn, the first
post-tax loss in Japanese banking history, against a profit of Y1.7bn last
year. 'We have come to the conclusion that asking for outside help is the
only way we can survive,' Mr Hirano said. With Mitsubishi's assistance, the
trust bank plans a three-year reconstruction programme involving up to 25
per cent cuts in costs.
The rescue was approved by the Ministry of Finance when it became clear that
Nippon Trust's net liabilities exceeded its capital, according to ministry
sources. Officials said the ministry would allow Nippon Trust Bank to
continue full operations as a trust bank because of those 'exceptional
circumstances'.
The ministry last year changed banking regulations to allow city banks to
establish trust bank subsidiaries. But the new rules prevent city banks from
operating some of the most profitable aspects of trust banking business such
as pension fund management and loan trusts.
The decision is likely to create concern among banks that Mitsubishi has
been handed an unfair advantage. Most city banks are planning to establish
trust banks next year. Unlike Mitsubishi, they will be severely constrained
under the new rules.
Trust banks are also understood to be unhappy, since Mitsubishi Bank can now
be expected to eat into their core business.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Amec sells Engil shareholding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Amec, the engineering and construction group, has sold its stake in Engil,
the Portuguese construction group, for Es2.7bn (Pounds 10.8m). The UK group
joins other international constructors, including Bouygues of France,
pulling out of joint ventures in Portugal.
Amec recently sold its 20 per cent stake in the French construction group
Serete for Pounds 11.3m to the company's management. The sales are part of a
reassessment by the UK group of its minority stakes in continental European
countries.
Minority stakes in domestic and cross-border rivals are popular in countries
such as Germany, France and the Netherlands. However, they are generally
considered unattractive in the UK and Italy, where companies prefer to have
majority control in subsidiary interests.
Amec's acquisition of minority continental stakes, however, has made it an
exception among UK companies. It also wholly-owns or has majority stakes in
Kittelberger, the German group, Norsk Elektro, the Norwegian engineering
company, and Amec Engineering in the Netherlands.
In January 1989, it acquired 50 per cent of a holding company which owns
49.9 per cent of the Engil construction company, quoted on the Lisbon stock
market. It bought the interest when Portugal was entering a boom era for
construction, fuelled by European Union funds.
The Engil group has now been restructured through an increase in the capital
of the holding company. A private placement of shares raised Es6.8bn, of
which Amec receives Es2.7bn for relinquishing its stake. Engil will spend an
another Es3bn acquiring 100 per cent control of three associate companies.
Portugal's Geril group now controls about 55 per cent of the Engil holding
company.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UAP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris' first set of post-privatisation results were
frankly unimpressive. The 22 per cent fall in net consolidated profits,
triggered by provisions for its continuing property problems, has
significantly reduced the group's chances of achieving its promised 30 per
cent profits increase for the full year.
Without earnings growth to support the shares, the market was left to worry
about net asset value. But the collapse in bonds and equities, and
continuing weakness of the property market, has made unrealised capital
gains plummet. The market's concerns were reflected by a 5 per cent slump in
the share price.
The implications of UAP's share performance for the French privatisation
programme, and particularly AGF's share sale, are serious. Investors who
bought UAP at privatisation in May are nursing a 13 per cent loss. The fact
that the shares have only slightly underperformed the CAC-40 index offers
little comfort. If the losses begin to affect retail investor confidence,
the French treasury will be faced with the prospect of offering AGF at an
even bigger discount to the market.

Compared with the feverish anticipation surrounding Mr Kenneth Clarke's
first Budget last year, this year's exercise has attracted remarkably little
excitement so far. Perhaps that is because Mr Clarke has already been so
emphatically dismissive of the prospect for tax cuts in the short run.
Judging by the yesterday's 'green budget' from Goldman Sachs and the
Institute for Fiscal Studies, he has little room for manoeuvre anyway.
Though the public sector borrowing requirement is falling faster than
expected, it is all to do with the impact on spending of
higher-than-expected growth and low inflation.
Unlike last year, when the government had to deal with a surging deficit,
there is no urgent need for a change in the overall fiscal stance. While the
pace of recovery remains uncertain there is little call for further
tightening over and above what is already in the pipeline. Equally,
premature relaxation could spill over into a deterioration in the payments
deficit. The UK's unexpectedly strong trade performance this year has added
powerfully to the impression that the recovery is sustainable.
So if Mr Clarke does want to make a political splash with the Budget, it
looks as though he will need to find a way of robbing Peter to pay Paul. An
obvious possibility is freezing allowances to finance an increase in the 20
per cent tax band. But Mr Clarke's tax on insurance premiums last year also
shows he enjoys springing surprises. The City seems to have fought off any
serious attack on dividends but, given its unpopularity with the public at
large, the financial sector should not rest entirely easy till after
November 29.

The prospects for the Chinese telecommunications market can, appropriately
enough, be described in terms of telephone numbers: at least Dollars 100bn
(Pounds 63.2bn) to be spent between now and the end of the century and
exponential growth in the number of telephone lines. In this context, Cable
&amp; Wireless's announcement yesterday about a possible Dollars 300m investment
in two Chinese projects is drop in the ocean - but an important one none the
less.
If the joint ventures come off, C&amp;W stands to win a commanding position in
the fledgling mobile telephones market in Beijing, and to capture the bulk
of telephone traffic between Hong Kong and the Chinese capital. It will
moreover be well positioned for further opening of the market - hence a
jubilant reaction from the UK and Hong Kong stock markets.
However, the market reaction was driven more by sentiment than an assessment
of what Hongkong Telecom - C&amp;W's 57.5 per cent owned subsidiary - has so far
achieved in its negotiations with China's telecoms authorities. The details
of the contracts have still to be worked out and C&amp;W's hopes of investing in
China on the basis of profit-sharing may well be dashed. China has not
definitively dropped its objections to foreign companies taking direct
equity participation in the sensitive telecoms sector.
Still, the China connection is positive for C&amp;W, which generated nearly
two-thirds of its operating profits from Hongkong Telecom last year. But
investors who like the story are more likely to want to buy shares in the
Hongkong company direct. Long-term questions about C&amp;W's future strategic
orientation remain, especially now that Mercury is entering a low growth
phase.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Submarines in BAe's sights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace may be known for its metal bashing skills, but the
financial engineering involved in yesterday's agreed bid for VSEL was first
class. Most importantly, the deal would broaden BAe's narrow capital base.
The additional capital should bolster customers' confidence that the group
can handle large contracts without significant cash-flow problems. It should
also help BAe make the scale of provisions against the troubled turboprop
operations necessary for their eventual disposal. VSEL's Pounds 284m cash
would be a bonus.
In earnings terms, the tax benefits would be particularly striking. BAe
could offset VSEL's profits against its huge unused capital allowances,
trading losses and ACT. These should drive BAe's tax rate down from 33 per
cent to 25 per cent and make the acquisition earnings enhancing. Lastly, the
additional consolidation would have the advantage of making a successful GEC
bid for BAe less likely because of competition concerns.
The financial conjuring does not invalidate the industrial logic, though its
validity would take longer to prove. In the short term, BAe admits it would
struggle to maintain VSEL's profits in spite of the remaining Trident work.
In the longer term, the new grouping would need prove its worth by winning
contracts such as the second batch of Trafalgar submarines. By linking the
two groups, the chances of winning would be significantly enhanced. In spite
of the financial and industrial logic of BAe's offer, the deal could yet be
undone by GEC's offering a competing cash bid. If successful, that could
leave BAe struggling to dispose of its turboprop business without a
conventional rights issue.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Ex-Disney head joins Spielberg in new entertainment group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the most powerful figures in Hollywood - Mr David Geffen, the
billionaire music mogul, Mr Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film
director, and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of Walt
Disney's movie studio - are joining forces in a new entertainment company.
The company, which will open early next year, aims to compete directly with
the leading studios - including Disney - by producing movies, animated
films, television programmes, music and interactive entertainment.
The three founders will own equal shares of the venture and will provide the
initial funding. However, there was speculation among industry observers
that they might soon seek external finance.
Mr Tim Wallace, entertainment industry analyst at SG Warburg Securities in
New York, said: 'What will be really interesting is whether they team up
with any of the telecommunications and computer companies that now want to
buy into Hollywood.'
The news ends weeks of speculation about Mr Katzenberg's future since he
left Disney in August. Mr Katzenberg, 43, played a pivotal part in Disney's
success since the late 1980s, culminating in the release of The Lion King,
its latest animated hit which has already grossed Dollars 270m in the US
alone.
Mr Katzenberg, once dubbed the 'golden retriever' for his flair for flushing
out talent, quit after being passed over for the presidency. His new
partners are two of his closest, and wealthiest, friends.
Mr Geffen, 51, made his first million by the age of 25 and has since become
a billionaire by investing the Dollars 710m he made in 1990 from selling his
record company's share of the MCA entertainment group to Japan's Matsushita.
His Geffen Films subsidiary will become part of the new venture, as will
Amblin Entertainment, Mr Spielberg's production company. Mr Spielberg, 47,
will continue to direct for other companies but is expected to use the group
as an outlet for his fascination with technology.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Yeltsin sacks finance minister in rouble row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday sacked Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russia's acting
finance minister, and demanded that parliament remove Mr Victor
Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, as he moved to defuse the political
row over the collapse of the rouble.
Mr Yeltsin called the 21.5 per cent plunge in the rouble on Tuesday a
'threat to national security' and set up a commission, including the head of
the federal counter-intelligence service, to investigate its 'sabotage'. The
rouble has lost half of its dollar value in the past two months.
However, a rebellious parliament may not approve Mr Gerashchenko's removal
when it votes on October 21. Parliament will also hold a vote of confidence
on the government on the same day, and yesterday rejected Mr Yeltsin's veto
on a law setting broad-based rules for passing next year's budget. Mr Yegor
Gaidar, former prime minister and leader of the Russia's Choice pro-reform
party, warned that conservative opposition forces might try to manipulate
events to destabilise the political climate and seize power.
Some senior economic policy officials believe that Tuesday's currency
auction was rigged with the collusion of conservative ministers to discredit
the economic reform process. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister,
rushed back from his holiday in Sochi to discuss the economic crisis with
his ministers. The rouble recovered ground yesterday, climbing from 3,926
against the dollar to 3,736.
Western economists in Moscow said the reform process had now reached a
critical juncture and suggested the government had to decide whether to
tighten monetary policy and stop issuing cheap credits to industry and
agriculture or revert to Soviet-style central economic management.
International financial institutions will view Mr Yeltsin's choice to
replace Mr Dubinin as finance minister as an important indicator of the
government's commitment to reform.
The strongly pro-reform Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former finance minister who
quit the government earlier this year, is a candidate, receiving support in
parliament yesterday. But Mr Fyodorov said in London that he would lay down
strict policy conditions if asked to return.
Mr Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice-president of the International Finance
Corporation which acts as the investment arm of the World Bank said
yesterday that the currency crisis was unlikely to deter serious foreign
investors.

FT  13 OCT 94 / RJB Mining set to pay Pounds 900m for English pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining, a coal company listed on the stock exchange only last year, is
the government's preferred candidate to take over British Coal's English
mining assets, after it is believed to have made an offer of more than
Pounds 900m.
If the agreement is sealed over the next few weeks, the company will take
over all three English regions, which include 15 of British Coal's 16
remaining pits.
Celtic Energy, a management buy-out team, is the preferred bidder for South
Wales. Mining (Scotland), a consortium, is favourite for the Scottish
region.
A consortium including the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the breakaway
union whose members worked during the 1984-85 miners' strike, failed to win
its bid for the two central England regions.
The UDM miners' union lodged its bids in partnership with Coal Investments,
led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, the former British Coal commercial director.
Shares in Coal Investments, one of the stock market's top performers in the
past year, fell by 20p yesterday to 118p. The company operates under licence
four former British Coal mines.
The government aims to complete privatisation of the industry on December
24. Its decisions on preferred bidders, announced by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, at the Conservative party conference, took the
industry by surprise.
Although British Coal had argued strongly that the industry should be sold
as one company, many industry executives assumed that the government's
desire for competition would lead to a break-up.
If the talks with RJB are successful, the company will produce more than
four-fifths of Britain's coal. RJB won the government's backing by putting
in the highest combined offer for the three regions. Mr Tim Eggar, the
energy minister, said the predominant criterion for all the bids had been
financial.
The government also announced yesterday that it had selected preferred
bidders for four pits closed by British Coal this year. CI has been chosen
for Annesley/Bentinck in Notts, RJB for Thorne in Yorkshire and Ellington in
Northumberland and an employee buy-out team for Tower colliery in south
Wales.
Mr Eggar said that the value of the bids could not be disclosed. But he
would announce the total proceeds of the sale of British Coal after it had
been completed at the end of December.
RJB Mining, named after Mr Richard Budge, chief executive, has been involved
in opencast mining for about 20 years and already operates three mines
closed in the past two years by British Coal.

The Lord Mayor Sir Paul Newall, in Kuwait City yesterday during what was
supposed to have been a routine Gulf trade tour, was at least well prepared.
Britain may be mustering only a paltry collection of troops to send to the
Kuwaitis' assistance, but the Lord Mayor's team should pass muster. Sir Paul
did part of his national service with the Royal Fusiliers in the Sudan. His
swordbearer Colonel John Ansell was with the Trucial Oman Scouts in the
1950s and was attached to the Kuwaiti armed forces in the early 1980s. Even
the third member of the party, the 'chief commoner' John Holland, is an
honorary colonel in a TA parachute battalion. On this occasion the extra
baggage in a Lord Mayor's overseas junket seems justifiable.

Vincent Tan, the prominent Malaysian-Chinese businessman, is after MDollars
20m (Dollars 7.9m) damages from a magazine called Malaysian Industry, which
he accuses of writing a series of articles that sought to destroy his
personal and commercial reputation.
In Kuala Lumpur's high court, Tan this week claimed to be 'the brains'
behind Berjaya, a group with textiles, leisure, media and assorted other
industries. He certainly is head and controlling shareholder of Berjaya,
which he says now has 200 companies and 14,000 employees. Tan says that the
articles have caused alarm and despondency among fund managers, and that
some had sold their Berjaya shares.
'Yours humbly, Vincent Tan, is always in the forefront,' said Tan. 'Even if
the MDollars 20m is awarded to me, it cannot undo the harm and the stress
put on me,' he added. 'If I had a weak heart I would have died. But
fortunately I am 42 years old, still young and strong.'

Michael Portillo's triumphal progress at the Tory party conference in
Bournemouth tripped up yesterday. Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the
Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward group, unwittingly ruined the
employment secretary's best line at a fringe meeting. Unknown to Sir George,
Portillo was preparing to poke fun at Labour's habit of charging for some of
its policy documents.
But Sir George threw in his path a banana skin, by launching a hard sell for
a CWF booklet of Portillo's speeches - Clear Blue Water - and a snip at
Pounds 4.95. 'Michael Portillo is only too willing to autograph it for you,'
added Gardiner.
Side-stepping rapidly, Portillo congratulated CWF for 'having the chutzpah'
to assemble the booklet, saying: 'It's a real tribute to the capitalist
system.' As is Portillo.

<TEXT>
Jan Kavan can afford to smile again; he has been officially cleared by a
Czech court of the charge of collaborating with the StB, communist
Czechoslovakia's equivalent of the KGB.
In March 1991 a parliamentary commission said Kavan's name had been found in
StB files. Kavan had been a famous dissident, indeed the opposition's main
link with the west, while he lived in exile in London between 1969-89. The
accusation was based on meetings he had in 1969-70 with an StB agent based
in London's Czechoslovak embassy.
The ministry of interior says it will appeal against the latest judgment,
though Kavan is confident there is no further evidence. He is now standing
unopposed for the chairmanship of the Czech Social Democratic party foreign
affairs committee - effectively making him shadow foreign minister.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Observer: Goldman wonder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If all private partnerships suffer from envy, Goldman Sachs must have an
acute case; the rank and file always feels the partners keep the goodies all
to themselves.
At Goldman, where 150 partners are reputed to have earned more than the rest
of the 9,000 staff last year, the problem has reached its most extreme form.
Perhaps that explains why the US investment bank has just opened the
partnership door a little wider. The firm has elevated 58 staffers to the
ranks of the fabulously wealthy, compared with 35 in the previous biannual
promotion.
But for every new partner there will be dozens of ambitious types who will
be bitterly disappointed that they were overlooked.
If not made a Goldman partner by your mid-30s, the chances are pretty slim
you will make the grade. Add in the fact that an increasing number of the
privileged few are retiring early and the average age of retirement is now
down to 47, it's easy to see why Goldman veterans who have been passed over
for partnership could easily become demoralised.
So far in 1994, Goldman's profits are reckoned to be running at little more
than a quarter of last year's. Hence the gap between the earnings of the
partners and the also-rans is not quite so startling as last year.
However, the problem has not gone away. With roughly a third of Goldman's
partners now being new boys, it's hard to believe they will want to change
the increasingly anachronistic payments system.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Defence mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the prospect of submarine maker VSEL being taken over by British
Aerospace or GEC, the rationalisation of the UK defence industry is moving
into its end game. GEC has already collected most of rival defence
electronics supplier Ferranti; GKN has bought Westland; now BAe and GEC are
seeking to secure their position in naval engineering.
At first sight some of these mergers lack coherence. Yet because the UK has
reduced its defence industry to one aircraft manufacturer, a dominant
electronics company, two large makers of land vehicles and a few shipyards,
companies have to find cost savings from merging the companies which are
left. The logical conclusion of this process would leave the UK with two
giants: GEC, whose prime expertise is in electronics systems, and BAe which
makes its money from engineering and project management. The question now is
whether they themselves should merge or should seek alliances in a wider
European context.
There is something to be said for a merger. GEC's Pounds 2.8bn cash mountain
would provide BAe with the cast iron financial stability it has always
lacked, while BAe's marketing flair could help GEC succeed in export
markets. On the other hand, the Ministry of Defence may object to merger if
the two companies have already digested the remainder of the defence
industrial base. The two companies' cultures could also clash in a way which
turned the dream merger into a nightmare. It is not hard to imagine GEC's
inflexibility combining with BAe's accident-prone nature to produce a
disaster.
The more attractive alternative, which both are already pursuing, is closer
collaboration with continental partners. BAe has been negotiating a missile
alliance with Matra of France and an ordnance merger with Giat. GEC is
pooling its sonar business with the French electronics company, Thomson.
Better still would be wholesale rationalisation of the European defence
industry. Unfortunately this is being blocked by political objections.
Britain, France and Germany in particular see their defence industries as
vital security interests and status symbols.
They should realise that the ideal of independent national defence
industries is an illusion. Many key technologies come from US, Japanese or
other EU countries. Some equipment is so expensive that European countries
can only afford it if it is pooled in Nato. Such collaboration would be so
much easier if full cross-border mergers were permitted.
European politicians should seize the opportunity to remove the barriers
obstructing mergers while the defence industry is still strong enough to
compete with other suppliers. If that happened, companies such as BAe and
GEC could decide in a free market whether their future is as national
monoliths or international specialists with the scale to take on the best in
the world.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Private bidders' dash for coal: Heseltine may have made some
shrewd decisions over the sell-off of the UK's pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine's relief was palpable yesterday as he announced the
preferred bidders for British Coal, the state-owned mining company, and the
industry moved into the final stages of privatisation.
'We have received offers which can be measured in hundreds of millions of
pounds,' he told representatives at the Conservative party conference in
Bournemouth. 'By next January nearly 30 British Coal pits will be in the
private sector.'
The trade and industry secretary's exultation was understandable. It was
almost two years to the day since a crisis erupted over pre-privatisation
pit closures that many observers thought would end his political career.
Mr Heseltine received the applause he expected from the party faithful, some
of whom have been highly critical of the government's coal policy. But the
government's problems with coal are not over yet.
First, ministers and their advisers must complete the final negotiations
with what Mr Heseltine called the 'likely successful bidders'. These are RJB
Mining, a quoted company whose bids have been conditionally accepted for the
three English regions and two closed pits, Thorne in Yorkshire and Ellington
in Northumberland; Celtic Energy, a management buy-out for most of Wales;
Mining (Scotland), a consortium, for the Scottish pits; an employee buy-out
team for Tower pit in south Wales; and Coal Investments, another quoted
company, for the Annesley Bentinck pit in Nottinghamshire.
Nothing is signed yet. A failure to reach final deals with the preferred
bidders would be embarrassing for Mr Heseltine, who would then have to try
to find an alternative buyer among other bidders.
But the real test for the government will be what happens to the industry
after the privatisation, which is expected to be completed on December 24.
If more pits close, blame is likely to be laid at the door of the government
even if the industry is privately owned. Ministers will also face strong
criticism if any of the companies they have selected to run Britain's pits
find themselves in financial difficulty.
The government has taken a lot of trouble to ensure that such embarrassments
are avoided. Rothschild, the government's merchant bank adviser, said that
while the successful bidders had offered the largest amounts of money, they
had also satisfied it on 'intangible issues', including their financial
viability and their long-term commitment to the industry.
The outcome of the tendering process has also given the government a result
that is politically attractive. By choosing a management buy-out for the
south Wales pits and a consortium in which trade unions have a stake for
Scotland, they have been able to give credence to the government's desire to
give employees a stake in the industry.
The selection of locally based companies in Wales and Scotland will also
avoid accusations in those countries of an English takeover.
Ministers have taken a risk in disappointing the ambitions of the Union of
Democratic Mineworkers, the breakaway union, which was in a consortium
bidding for the two central English regions.
But the choice of RJB for all three English regions could prove a shrewd
move. If RJB succeeds in completing the negotiations, it will take on 15 of
the 16 British Coal pits that are still open. The company reckons that when
these are added to the opencast interests that it will also take over and
the three pits it already leases from the government, it will control more
than 80 per cent of the coal industry.
The government's willingness to concentrate so much power in one company has
taken the industry by surprise. Even in his speech yesterday, Mr Heseltine
was stressing the benefits of competition that have arisen from other
privatisations.
But giving all three regions to RJB allows ministers to argue that they are
not driven by free-market dogma and that they have listened to British
Coal's advice. British Coal has argued throughout the privatisation process
that the industry should remain as one.
'Privatising English coal in one chunk is a good outcome for the industry,'
said one British Coal executive yesterday. 'It will give the company
strength through size, particularly in its discussions with the electricity
generators for coal sales deals.'
There was less rejoicing in the industry that the government's choice had
fallen on RJB. Some executives said they would have preferred to work for Mr
Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal marketing director who now heads Coal
Investments, or for Mr Bob Siddall, the opencast director who led a
management buy-out team.
Mr Richard Budge, the entrepreneur who heads RJB, is viewed as highly
competent within British Coal, but there are fears that his personality may
be too forceful for the good of the industry. If he lives up to his image,
he could face confrontation with Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, who is resolutely opposed to the changes in
work practices and culture RJB says it needs to make a success of the
English pits.
'The negatives are probably more in people's minds than in reality but he is
viewed as domineering and dictatorial,' said one executive. 'We will want to
see evidence that he can delegate.'
Mr Budge yesterday played down the potential for confrontation. 'Some of our
existing pits have NUM members and there are no problems there,' he said.
RJB's other main task is to sort out the finance needed to fund the bid.
Since the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange last year, the
shares have outperformed the market, but the company is still capitalised at
less than Pounds 160m.
Neither RJB nor the government was prepared to discuss the size of its
tenders yesterday, but the company is believed to have paid at least Pounds
900m. With gearing of about 70 per cent already, an issue of shares and more
borrowing seems inevitable.
Stockbrokers' analysts said yesterday they saw no problems with raising such
sums. Some said RJB's share price would rise when the shares returned to the
market following yesterday's suspension. Much, however, will depend on the
detail of the financing which has yet to be announced.
Details of the successful Scottish and Welsh bids were similarly
undisclosed. However, to win the Welsh bid, Celtic Energy beat off powerful
competition, including a consortium grouping Powell Duffryn and Wimpey.
'Both companies wanted the Welsh region pretty badly to preserve their
opencast interests there,' said one analyst. 'Celtic Energy must have put in
a substantial offer.'
But perhaps the largest determinant of the companies' future success will be
the market for their coal, over which they have only limited control. The
biggest problems are the potential growth of competing fuels in the
electricity market.
The 'dash for gas' that has forced the closure of so many pits in the past
few years has spluttered back into life in the last few weeks. Two regional
electricity companies, Midlands and Electricity, have announced their
involvement in consortia to build gas-fired power stations which will
eliminate the need for 3m tonnes of coal a year. British Gas is negotiating
on the possibility of building a 1,200MW station near Bristol that could
displace another 3m tonnes of coal.
British Coal executives and some of the unsuccessful bidders say they have
been taken by surprise by the announcements. They also pointed out that the
marketplace will be more crowded than expected because of the acceptance
yesterday of bids to reopen some pits closed in the past year by British
Coal.
Mr Budge was unconcerned. He had no plans for further closures because he
believed the market would shrink only marginally from its current capacity.
'Don't forget that there are 17m tonnes of imports and we can displace most
of them,' he said.
The 8,000 or so deep-pit miners who remain in the industry will be praying
that Mr Budge and not the industry pessimists are right.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Exclude Saddam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
That President Saddam Hussein cannot get away with invading Kuwait was
conclusively demonstrated in 1991. That he can be deterred from invading it,
in spite of the certain consequences, is less sure. He only has to look as
if he might be about to try, and thousands of troops and aircraft are rushed
to the scene. This procedure is expensive and if repeated would be
undignified.
Mr Saddam is well aware of that. In fact he is probably enjoying the
commotion he has caused. Even if it does not pay any diplomatic dividend,
such as a Russian-brokered deal involving an easing or gradual lifting of
sanctions, it shows that he still has the capacity to induce something like
panic in the international community. That may make him look stronger and so
reinforce his grip on his own armed forces.
The US and Kuwait are rightly looking for ways to make it more difficult for
him to achieve this effect. The no-fly zone south of the 32nd parallel,
imposed in August 1992, already helps, since it deprives his forces of air
cover as soon as they are within 130 miles of the Kuwaiti border. But
clearly it is not enough. So they are canvassing the idea of a total
exclusion zone, in which the movement of troops and military equipment would
be banned on the ground as well as in the air.
Such a zone has been imposed by the allies north of the 36th parallel since
April 1991, and has helped to preserve the Kurdish 'safe haven' in the
north-east. If only the same had been done in the south in March 1991, Mr
Saddam would surely not have been able to defeat the Shia rebellion in the
south. At the time, the US declined ostentatiously to give any support to
the rebels, although it had half a million men virtually within earshot of
what was happening. President Bush's spokesman, Mr Marlin Fitzwater, even
stated publicly that the US had no objection to the use of helicopter
gunships to suppress the revolt.
The only reason given publicly for this attitude at the time was an
unconvincing, and in the circumstances hardly appropriate, neutrality in
Iraq's internal affairs. The real reason was that the US feared a Shia
success would mean that Iraq, or at any rate the southern half of it, would
become a satellite of revolutionary Iran. Washington hoped and believed the
Iraqi army, having suppressed the revolt and secured the integrity of the
country, would depose Mr Saddam and replace him with a more pliable regime.
That strategy has manifestly failed. The US is now supporting an alternative
leadership, the Iraqi National Congress, which has brought together Kurdish,
Shia and some Sunni opponents of Mr Saddam. The right course now would be to
declare southern Iraq a demilitarised zone, and encourage the INC to
establish its authority there. It is hard to believe Mr Saddam's regime
could long survive in Baghdad once more than half the country was outside
its control.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Russia unravels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For nine months, Russia's economic policy has been constructed around a
myth: that an economy can be stabilised gradually. The government feared the
political consequences of a more radical approach. Instead, it has spent
months trying to foster belief in a more user-friendly alternative. This
week's fall in the rouble is only the most recent evidence that the package
is unsellable. The currency will fall further as long as its value is tied
to the success of a bankrupt policy.
The 21.5 per cent fall in the rouble on Tuesday left President Boris Yeltsin
looking for scapegoats. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, has
been sacked. Central bank chairman Mr Viktor Gerashchenko may go with him.
Part of the blame for the government's lack of credibility lies with
individuals. The tacit relaxation of monetary controls over the summer came
as a result of individual ministers giving in to the constant pleas for
assistance from agricultural and industrial producers. More broadly,
evidence of state corruption continues to mount.
But changing the individual policymakers will do nothing if there is not a
fundamental reform of economic policy to go with it. There must be a stable
macroeconomic framework if Russia is to achieve sustainable long-term
growth. Stability means winning the battle against inflation, and winning
that battle means establishing a strict set of monetary and fiscal
guidelines to which ministers can credibly adhere.
Few - whether inside or outside Russia - believe that the current approach
can deliver this stability. Reducing inflation, without the benefit of a
nominal anchor for prices, such as a fixed exchange rate, has meant months
of attempted monetary restraint, supported by necessarily high real interest
rates.
High interest rates, in forcing more producers into bankruptcy, fuelled the
very pressures for monetary stimulus which policymakers were already in a
weak position to resist. But high rates also cost the government dear, by
raising the cost of servicing government debt. The longer they prevail, the
more likely it is that the government will resort to further inflation in
order to lower that burden.
Thus, whether or not members of the government actively fuelled the fall of
the rouble - as President Yeltsin and others have suggested - it is the
logical consequence of anti-inflationary policies which lack both the will
and the means to deliver.
The west can do more than watch. Under the auspices of the IMF, there must
be a clear offer of large-scale financial support for any government willing
to make a decisive break with the incremental, escapist approach of recent
months. Support for a social safety net is vital, as is a fund to back the
rouble, which would psychologically underpin a commitment to peg the
exchange rate and make it fully convertible. But only a reformed government
could make it worth defending.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Personal View: Signs that united Germany is working
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's German elections are the first true test of the political
aspirations of unified Germany. The euphoria that followed the fall of the
Berlin Wall is long gone. So too are the transitional arrangements that
allowed the two halves of the new Germany to vote as separate districts in
the 1990 elections.
In the four years since those elections, I have been to east Germany several
times. I have heard the stories of colleagues dismissed from universities,
'wound up', as local usage has it. I have heard of careers ruined, people
thrown out of their homes, and apparently flourishing state enterprises sold
to west German companies which shut them down.
In such soil, conspiracy theories grow. From such people, votes come for the
Party of Democratic Socialism, the successor to East Germany's Communist
party.
What I should to say to my east German friends is that, in spite of
everything, unification works. Erfurt in September 1994 looks better than
Erfurt in July 1993. People are better dressed. The shops are fuller.
Five years after the Berlin Wall came down, polls show that the majority of
east Germans consider themselves winners as a result of the change. Unified
Germany transfers each year about DM150bn (Pounds 61bn) from west to east.
No wonder they feel good.
Currency reform has also worked. I talked to one of the economists who
advised the Bundesbank on the rate of exchange between the two German
currencies on unification. Experts at the time decided that it should be one
D-Mark for 2.5 Ostmarks. Chancellor Helmut Kohl ignored them. He heard the
footsteps of 40,000 people leaving east Germany each week. When the crowd
said, 'if the D-Mark won't come to us, we'll go to the D-Mark', Kohl gave
them the D-Mark.
I asked the economist: 'Who was right, the Bundesbank or Kohl?'
He hesitated and then said: 'Kohl.' There was no time to fiddle with
exceptions and regulations, still less to guess the unintended consequences.
Among the beneficiaries of currency conversion, along with pensioners, were
the organs of the east German state, whose huge, largely concealed cash
balances suddenly turned into hard currency. By one of those ironies that
make history such fun, Kohl became the benefactor of the PDS, the party
which might bring his chancellorship to an end if it succeeds in winning
seats in the new Bundestag.
I am here with a group of foreign academics, guests of the German Academic
Exchange Service. I have had a chance to travel widely. What I see is not
change, but continuity.
In the five years since the Leipzig demonstrations of October 1989, the old
Federal Republic of Germany has absorbed five new federal states relatively
painlessly. The constitutional lawyer Hartmut Jackl points out that the
German Basic Law, its constitution provisionally adopted in 1949, has
scarcely been altered by unification and the federal structure not at all.
Since 1949, Germany has had coalition governments at federal level and on
most state levels. Coalitions move to the centre and move slowly, if at all.
German voters like that. Since 1949, no electoral swing has ever exceeded 5
per cent.
If the liberal Free Democratic party fails to get 5 per cent of the vote in
next Sunday's election, it will not enter the new Bundestag. Since that
would amount to change of much more than 5 per cent, it is not going to
happen.
It does not matter that the FDP failed to get 5 per cent in the last seven
state elections. Enough German voters understand their political system to
ignore state results. Yesterday the Allensbach Institute announced that 57
per cent of those intending to give their second vote to the FDP will have
cast their first vote for Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
These German voters know what they want and how to get it.
The German state of 1994 is no longer provisional. The federal republic had
40 years of success before 1989. The last five years have brought more.
Lady Thatcher and President Francois Mitterrand were wrong about a united
Germany. It is more, not less, stable than the pre-existing states. The
symbol of that stability is the massive bulk of Helmut Kohl, 'Bismarck in a
baggy sweater'.
Bismarck united the old Germany with the sword; Kohl with the vote. That's
the real difference between the old and the new Germany.

The Theft of the Second Russian Revolution By Stephen Handelman Michael
Joseph, Pounds 16.99, 360 pages
After a year spearheading the Russian government's crackdown on organised
crime, Inspector Vladimir Kalinichenko decided it was a Sisyphean struggle.
'In this sort of environment, the people who were in official posts can
still do whatever they want,' a dejected Mr Kalinichenko explained, after
discovering yet another link between the gangsters he was meant to fight and
the government officials he was meant to serve.
Mr Kalinichenko is one of hundreds of Russians whose adventures in the new
wild east convinced Stephen Handelman that gangster-bureaucrats have become
the ruling figures in the new Russia. A bitter assertion - made timely by
allegations that government insiders may have profited from this week's
crash of the rouble - this is the subject of Comrade Criminal, Handelman's
great, but depressing new book.
Mr Handelman, who was Moscow bureau chief for Canada's Toronto Star for five
years, contends that the promise held out by the collapse of communism
exists no more. Instead of capitalism, Russia has turned to 'frenzied
profiteering'; instead of fairly applied laws and contracts, Russia has
corrupt officials and business deals enforced through the barrel of a gun;
and instead of democracy, Russia's future will be one of authoritarian rule
or criminal chaos.
His book is based on travels through the arms bazaars of the embattled
Chechen republic in the Caucasus, the bustling ports of tiny Estonia -
which, on the strength of metal smuggled in from Russia, became the world's
sixth largest exporter of ferrous metal in 1992 - and the large defence
plants of the Urals.
Gripping and lively, it is an account of mafia machinations and the
generally fruitless efforts of honest cops and outnumbered democratic
politicians to thwart them.
The democrats' struggle is a fight against history, suggests Handelman. The
Bolshevik revolution of 1917 established a state ruled by communist
comrades, who, faced with impossible production targets, used corruption to
grease the creaky wheels of central planning.
The shadow of this state, revealed in fascinating detail by Handelman, was a
Vorovsky Mir, a criminal world, of gangsters who provided Soviet citizens
with the consumer goods their ruling comrades considered inessential.
Handelman's account of the cementing of an alliance between the comrades and
the criminals adds up to one of the most comprehensive and convincing
representations of what has happened in Russia since 1991. But the book
describes a system, rather than a government. The author offers a compelling
vision of how Russia is run, but the identities of these new rulers, and how
they are making their money, are subjects he skirts around.
Who is using Russia's thriving stock market to take control of the country?
What is happening in the oil and gas fields of Siberia? And who is
controlling Russia's buoyant metals trade?
It may be that no western reporter can penetrate the labyrinth of Russian
capitalism and live to tell the tale. But Handelman's book is like a vivid
account of the wild capitalists of 19th century America that fails to
mention the Rockefellers.
This is a serious failing. The restriction of Handelman's account to
shadowy, often unnamed figures on the margins of Russia's criminalised
political economy does nothing to prove many of his most powerful
assertions.
After rousing descriptions of the code of honour between Russia's gangsters,
and the corruption of its apparatchiks, Mr Handelman reveals his hand,
without support, in the third and concluding section of the book.
The comrade criminal has become 'the dominant political figure of Russia',
he charges. The second Russian revolution has already been 'stolen', he
argues, and the comrade criminals - 'the former nomenklatura and their
allies' - already dominate President Boris Yeltsin's cabinet.
Handelman takes a shot at Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the litigious mayor of Moscow,
who has been accused of corruption in the sale of the city's real estate.
Such charges against Mr Luzhkov have never been proved.
But the author only allusively and tentatively connects his faceless comrade
criminals with real men in Yeltsin's cabinet, with specific provincial
government leaders still in office or with Russia's leading industrialists
and financiers.
There are a few other, minor quibbles. Handelman's assertion that 'Russia's
post-communist uncertainty has been duplicated in other countries of the
former Soviet Union and eastern Europe' paints with too broad a brush. In
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia and Estonia, many former
communists have transformed themselves into capitalists but, unlike their
Russian comrades described by Handelman, they are rapidly and willingly
learning to play by the relatively genteel western rules of the game.
Moreover, Handelman was rash to predict that 'there are already signs of an
exodus of western investors'. On the contrary, this year more than Dollars
3bn of western investments have already gone into Russia.
Growing investment does not disprove Handelman's argument about the
basically deformed nature of Russia's new economy; in other emerging
markets, and sometimes at home, western businessmen have shown no
overpowering aversion to working with crooks. But western investors' rapid
acquisition of the skills necessary to deal with comrade capitalists renders
improbable Handelman's concluding hope that, alerted to the theft of the
second Russian revolution, the west will somehow come to the rescue.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: There ain't gonna be no tax cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK Budget for 1995-96, to be presented on November 29, is unlikely to
change the tax burden by more than is already planned as a result of
previous Budgets. It will be called a neutral one - quite wrongly as the tax
burden is increasing and will continue to do so.
A bogus debate is however starting on whether the Conservative government
should prepare to cut taxes in the following 1995 Budget. These would take
effect in 1996-97, the last financial year before an election must be held.
But there is one thing to get straight at the outset. In any sensible use of
language, there will not be any tax cuts either in this Budget or the next
one, whichever school of thought wins the debate. The only question is how
large the tax increases are to be.
The previous chancellor, Norman Lamont, announced in his Budget of March
1993 staggered tax increases to take effect in later years as economic
recovery got under way. This was what I called the Augustinian policy of
making the government's finances chaste, but not yet. The present
chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his Budget of November 1993 added to the tax
increases in the pipeline. The increases imposed by the two 1993 Budgets
together will have raised the tax take by Pounds 15bn or more than 2 per
cent of gross domestic product by the coming fiscal year, 1995-96. The aim
was to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement from its
post-recession peak of 7 per cent of GDP in 1993-94.
This would involve, according to Treasury projections, taxes, excluding
North Sea oil, rising from a low of 34 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to
more than 38 per cent by the late 1990s. In actual cash, and assuming very
moderate inflation, we are talking about an eventual net addition to the tax
burden of well in excess of Pounds 30bn - much larger than any conceivable
'tax cut'.
Assuming the present government remains in office at least until 1997 (the
last year for holding an election), the net effect of 18 years of
Conservative government will have been to raise the ratio of tax to GDP by 4
percentage points over the level it inherited from the Callaghan Labour
government. These trends were all in the official Budget documents and
neither chancellor tried to hide them. But it took a campaign by Labour's
Gordon Brown to make the public realise what was in store.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies, in its Green Budget presented in
collaboration with US investment bank Goldman Sachs, has a central estimate
of the PSBR for 1995-96 amounting to Pounds 21bn, some Pounds 9bn less than
the Treasury projected in its Red Book of a year ago. The improvement is,
however, due to the effect of unexpectedly rapid recovery on revenue and
unexpectedly low inflation on spending. It is therefore no reason for
relaxing tax policy if one believes that that policy ought to be related to
longer-run trends, and that cyclically induced fluctuations in government
should be taken in their stride.
But even if the influence of the business cycle were disregarded and the
whole improvement were to be crudely handed back to the taxpayer, the latter
would still be paying in tax a steadily rising proportion of her income. The
only question is thus whether to limit - but certainly not to reverse - the
size of the tax increases already planned and announced, which the public
accepts, however grudgingly, that it will have to pay.
Suppose however that in the November 1995 Budget Mr Clarke were to chance
his arm by providing Pounds 5bn of what the headlines would wrongly call
'tax cuts'. What then? It does not take a prophet to say that these measures
would largely take the form of widening the lower income-tax band and taking
one or two percentage points off the basic rate. The net effect then of
several Budgets together will have been a tax increase combined with a
structural change. The latter will have involved a reduction in tax
privileges for home-buyers, married couples and the like, and somewhat
higher indirect taxes especially on fuel. The proceeds would have been used
partly to reduce the budget deficit and partly to finance a slight reduction
in the marginal income tax rate. The changes will, on balance, be an
improvement but come as a side effect of raising rather than lowering taxes.
The authors of the Green Book, however, far from favouring a reduction in
the tax increases in the pipeline, lean on the contrary towards a further
fiscal tightening. Their argument is that if real GDP growth averages near 3
per cent per annum - their central estimate - a risk-averse government would
start to worry about the build-up in external debt arising from balance of
payments deficits.
Their prescription is to tighten fiscal policy more than is really required
to slow down domestic demand and offset this by a monetary policy 'set to
achieve an exchange rate consistent with some improvement in net exports' -
code for further devaluation. My guess is that quite a few in the Treasury
would like the chancellor to take this approach if they thought they could
get away with it, but as a next best will settle for trying to sell it to a
future Labour government.
Yet on present evidence fiscal tightening would be just as foolish as the
cosmetic tax cuts advocated by the Tory right. The whole external deficit
scenario is highly speculative and downgrades sterling's highly competitive
present real exchange rate. More fundamentally, a build-up in external debt,
which emanates entirely from the private sector, is a matter for the private
sector and is self-reversing.
The Green Book's own projections show that public finances are moving in a
sustainable direction and are most unlikely to be the source of an external
deficit. In the second chart, projected public-sector deficits are compared
with the creation of capital assets by the public sector. They show that the
'golden rule' - which says that public-sector deficits should not exceed
capital formation - is likely soon to be achieved. Another test of soundness
 -the stabilisation of the debt to GDP ratio - should be achieved still
earlier.
Indeed the chart shows that public sector finances have been fairly sensibly
run under a series of chancellors. When the UK was recovering from recession
in the early 1980s, there was a budget deficit. In the boom of the later
1980s the public finances went into surplus and the 'golden rule' was more
than observed. Further deficits were incurred in the recession of the early
1990s which are again giving way to much smaller deficits and perhaps even
surpluses.
Goldman Sachs nowadays loses no opportunity of denouncing the tax remissions
of the late 1980s. Yet at the time the firm was adamant that the budget
surpluses of the period amounted to a tightening of policy even on a
cyclically adjusted basis. Rough and ready attempts to set Budget objectives
without being too much influenced by temporary fluctuations are more likely
to succeed than more refined cyclical adjustments possible only with
hindsight.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, When Visa International set about finding out the important factors in
choosing a hotel why did it restrict the question about business centres to
men? (Business Travel Survey, October 10). Was it because the researchers
assumed that the women interviewed were merely accompanying the men and
therefore interested only in factors such as hairdryers and prompt laundry
services?
I have just returned from a business trip to Australia, during which I sent
and received a large number of faxes, telephone message and packages
courtesy of the business centre at my hotel. Of course I appreciated the
hairdryer and the iron too and it was a refreshing change to be supplied
with additional clothes hangers capable of holding skirts, rather than
trousers.
What is more, nobody batted an eyelid when I signed the Visa credit slip
rather than my six-foot five-inch male partner.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof GORDON CONWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'University reform' (October 11), calls for research
funding to be restricted to a designated 20 or so universities. But if such
concentration is to occur, it must be strictly on the basis of excellence.
There is a belief in some quarters that high-quality research can only be
conducted in large institutions. Yet of the 20 top research universities at
the last research assessment exercise, 11 were of middle or small size
(London School of Economics, Warwick, Lancaster, Sussex, York, Birkbeck,
Durham, Exeter, Essex, East Anglia and Bath).
These 11 have demonstrated that it is not necessary to be big to be
excellent or innovative. A high degree of focus, support for new fields, an
interdisciplinary approach and the ability to be flexible and fast-moving
can, individually or in combination, compensate for lack of size.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pervasive model for modern managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY KIPPENBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Tim Dickson's piece on Frederick Winslow Taylor (Management: Pioneers
and Prophets, October 3) is interesting and valuable.
Since so much of today's management theory is currently being questioned,
going back to its roots is an important contribution to the debate - unlike
The Economist, which has started its series on management theorists with Tom
Peters.
What Tim Dickson omits is that arguably Taylor 'invented' functional
management. This was an integral part of his scientific management approach
which broke all activities down into separate, divisible (and therefore
measurable) parts. Taylor's approach was no doubt valid for its time,
particularly among the largely unskilled migrant workforce in the US of the
late 19th century, as was Henri Fayol's similarly dated exposition of the
'practice of management' at a time when France faced considerable
international competition ('Les Miserables').
In the intervening years, these two founding theories of management have
been added to, amended and adjusted. Although they have also been
increasingly challenged, it is undeniable that they remain pervasive models
in most managers' mindsets.
They lie at the core of what many believe to be the theory and science of
management. As such they have taken on the semblance of certainties - so
deeply embedded that they are not even questioned.
Although their viability, as apparently unalterable truths, may have been
gently eroded over time, they have not been fundamentally challenged in such
a way that requires complete re-evaluation. Instead, later work - and there
has been much of it - has formed as an accretion around these original
ideas, rather than supplanting them. They therefore continue to lie buried
under layers of newer, sometimes fresher thinking - relatively undisturbed.
Much of the 'buzz' in management today - re-engineering, empowerment,
self-organising teams, de-layered and flatter management and even the 'fall'
of strategic planning - is at risk of failure (for good or ill) if the
prevalent mindsets inherited from the 19th century are not put up for
questioning. They brought us the concepts of 'staff' and 'line' and the need
for discrete functions, notions about forecasting and planning, the need for
command and control and the desirability of the stopwatch. There is a sense
of discordance with our world, 100 years later.
The sooner this is debated the better.

security' and 'Baltics struggle to muster a credible defence' (October 10).
Russia is rightly concerned about the stability and security of the southern
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States and is sufficiently
respectful of Nato to seek its endorsement before deploying Russian
peacemaking troops.
An exact parallel is Nato's concern for the stability and security of the
countries immediately to Nato's east. . .the three Baltic States, the
Visegrad four, Romania and Bulgaria.
There would now seem to be an opportunity for the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe to reach a mutually acceptable and beneficial
agreement - acknowledging that Russia should assume the lead role and deploy
peacemaking troops within the CIS, and acknowledging that Nato can similarly
deploy peacekeeping troops throughout those European countries above, to
Nato's east, and up to the CIS borders.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Arts: Tottering totalitarianism - Cinema

TO LIVE (12) Zhang Yimou
GERONIMO (12) Walter Hill
THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT (15)Stephan Elliott
WAR OF THE BUTTONS (PG) Jon Roberts
SPARROW (12)Franco Zeffirelli I once saw a stage performance of Man And
Superman in which the cast was taking its final bow when a large piece of
background scenery began falling on them. 'Look out]' yelled the audience.
Just in time, the players turned round and caught hold of the offending
flat.
A similar thing is now happening in Chinese cinema. Historical backdrops are
getting larger and heavier - in films like Farewell My Concubine, The Blue
Kite and now Zhang Yimou's To Live - and instead of enriching the characters
from a distance they tend to fall right on top of them.
To Live takes place over 30-odd years of Maoist history - 1940s to 1970s -
during which a poverty-racked couple (Gong Li, Ge You) lose their children,
their livelihood and most of their emotional bearings in the onslaught of
Great Leaps Forward and Cultural Revolutions.
Having gambled away his house in the opening scene, our hero breaks with his
wife, takes up puppetry, gets swept up in the war between Communists and
Nationalists, then returns home to his spouse and deaf-mute daughter.
Thereafter they surge more intimately across history's stage, while the
movie's lessons in the evils of totalitarianism totter or topple over them
like errant scenery.
The finest passages, in a movie never less than epic in its ambition, are
when they hold the backdrops off: when Zhang allows the particular to
grapple effectively with the panoramic. It can be the shot of a sudden
bayonet piercing the white placidity of the puppeteer's screen, announcing
the break-out of war in 1949. Or it can be the mordantly powerful scene of
the daughter's sojourn in a maternity hospital.
Here the doctors have all been dismissed or jailed as 'reactionary', so the
trainee nurses must cope with the girl's haemorrhaging and hysteria. Finally
a starving medico is dragged in - his condemned man's placard still round
his neck - and stuffed with buns while the camera swivels tragically,
comically between one mortal crisis and the other.
This is the Zhang of Red Sorghum and Raise The Red Lantern: a director of
dark wit and merciless compassion, who knows that the absurd and the
terrifying meet on the dark side of life's curvature. But To Live would have
been a stronger movie if it had allowed quirky human reaction to compete
more often with historical agenda. In the end we feel as much stunned as the
characters by the long march of Chinese politics: though to underline that
march's grim continuity Zhang himself, on the strength of To Live, is
currently banned from making another film in China.
Geronimo's time span is more modest: the last months of the Apache leader
who for five years, with a few hundred braves, resisted capture by a few
thousand US soldiers.
But Walter Hill is another film-maker fighting off the backcloth of history.
Overwhelmed by the burning rockscapes of Utah and the din of destiny, Jason
Patric as cavalry officer Charles Gatewood, who secured Geronimo's
surrender, makes a thin, inhibited hero. And Wes Studi's Indian, though
chiselled of feature and sonorous of voice, often seems part of the
landscape rather than the human world.
The film has decided that it is filming Mythic Events, so it adopts a
cathedral tone. The script by John Milius and Larry Gross is literate, even
Biblical. But we keep wishing the solemn Walter Hill (of The Long Riders)
had been pushed aside more often by the kinetic Walter Hill (of Driver and
Streets Of Fire), so the film could build on the hints of tantalising magic
that break into the historical liturgy: the black-and-white flurries of
dream-flashback that haunt Geronimo, or the hypnotic, fractured twanglings
of Ry Cooder's music.
In the cast Gene Hackman (cavalry general) and Robert Duvall (veteran scout)
steal the acting honours. Duvall especially shows that grandeur grows from
the particular: that history can be more eloquent when reflected in the tiny
tic of an eye or the hitch of a tired man's lip than as an unwieldy
cyclorama dwarfing or drowning the dramatis personae.
Terence Stamp, wigged, frocked and lipsticked, takes his career in a whole
new direction in the Australian film The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of
The Desert. Resembling a boot-sale Marlene Dietrich, the one-time British
heart-throb plays a drag queen joining up with two others (Hugo Weaving,
ex-Neighbours star Guy Pearce) on a tour through the Outback, during which
their bus breaks down.
At nature's mercy, what can they do but perform their numbers right there in
the desert? So They punch out Abba to the Aborigines. They swap choice
culture-shock epigrams. And they befriend a small town impresario (Bill
Hunter), who falls for La Stamp at the expense of his Oriental
performer-girlfriend, whose speciality is shooting ping-pong balls from an
intimate body part.
All this and eye-catching scenery too. Writer-director Stephan Elliott, who
underwhelmed the Cannes Film Festival in 1993 with Frauds, made up this year
by stealing the entire event with Priscilla. The film should ideally be seen
late at night with a crowd of well-wined friends. But once seen, never
forgotten: especially the sight of Pearce sporting a billowing silver
'train' as he mimes to 'Sempre Libera' on the bus's moving roof while
sitting inside a giant stiletto heel. I have never been to Australia, but I
felt that I had after this.
I have been to Ireland, but I never felt I was there in War Of The Buttons.
Set in the present day, this tale of two villages and their children's gang
rivalry feels like a 1950s film: that era when Scotland, Wales and Ireland,
on the British screen, were fantasylands of rural innocence dreamt up by
jaded London.
Here the writer and producer of Chariots Of Fire, Colin Welland and David
Puttnam, not content with re-potting Yves Robert's original 1962 French
comedy, also re-train it as a inspirational fable of detente. After much
running, jumping and fighting, the two fugitive gang leaders  - we somehow
know that good will sonorously triumph - end up saving each other's skins on
a mountain face.
Meanwhile debut director John Roberts tries to haul into competence his cast
of handpicked teenage unknowns. The best of these are the pintsized
camp-followers, allowed their small ration of funny faces and throwaway
comedy riffs. But the seniors are a dull lot: piped towards the uplifting
finale by Rachel Portman's sub-Chieftains music and never helping to clarify
for us - nor do Puttnam, Welland and company - whether this film is intended
as an exercise in rural charm or children's comedy or universal moral
improvement.
But Franco Zeffirelli's Sparrow is by some way the week's worst: another
gilded tussle between temporal and spiritual love like his Brother Sun,
Sister Moon. Aspiring nun Angela Bettis, on convent leave during a cholera
epidemic, falls for passing hunk Jonathan Scaech. Soon 1850s Sicily is
melting into gilded visual goo reminiscent of a margarine commercial. While
the camera does its soft-focus transports, guest stars Dennis Quilley,
Valentina Cortese and Vanessa Redgrave try to extract some sensible dialogue
 -vain task - from the soft-headed script.

British military authorities have a lovely dilemma for anyone who fought in
the Gulf War and now believes he is suffering because of the drugs
prescribed as a supposed defence against possible chemical attack by Saddam
Hussein. They just pop it all under the Official Secrets Act and prevent you
finding out anything. The Americans have acknowledged the existence of 'Gulf
War Syndrome' which entails damage to the auto-immune or nervous systems,
and have agreed to compensate victims, but the British are refusing to
accept that any such condition exists. Critical Eye has a second go at
investigating (9.00 C4). You do not often hear anyone say 'Serves them
right, the greedy pigs' about the Lloyds names who are losing everything in
the great insurance crash, yet the phrase hovers unspoken. However, to most
of us these people are faceless, so Inside Story sets out to meet some of
them (10.00 BBC1). In the opening episode of ITV's new soap, Revelations, we
had the bishop's new daughter-in-law in lacy basque and stockings, and
enthusiastic rumpy-pumpy on the bonnet of a car, so you can see why they are
transmitting it at 10.40.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Arts: Moscow Stations - Theatre / Down-and-out in Brezhnev's
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a suburban train from Moscow, Venichka Yerofeev is trying to get to
Petushki. He has consumed an heroic number of vodkas since early morning,
which seems to be the best way of coping with down-and-out life in
Brezhnev's Russia. Already - as perhaps always - he is gently, beatifically
bleary, and as the stations go by he regales us with notes on his journey,
anecdotes and reminiscences. Moscow is huge and bleak, and he has never
actually managed to find the Kremlin there; in Petushki, however, jasmine
scents the air and a lovely woman awaits him. As far as we can tell, he
never quite gets there.
Venedikt Yerofeev was an intellectual drop-out whose short novel
Moskva-Petushki was published in samizdat during the 1960s. In Stephen
Mulrine's eloquent adaptation, it makes a rich, blackly funny monologue for
Tom Courtenay (who did it first on Radio 3). The obvious comparison with
Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell goes only a little way: though Moscow Stations is
autobiographical too, Venichka has none of Bernard's cheerful malice, nor -
overtly, anyhow - anything of Louis-Ferdinand Celine's scathing fury at the
ruined life around him.
Instead, like a holy fool, he observes the bizarre, ludicrous and pitiful
things that go on around him kindly and dispassionately, from the safe
depths of his alcoholic haze. The comedy is mordant, but it is not he who
puts the bite into it. Though the drift of the narrative is as uncertain as
the direction of the train, the images of moral and civic decay tell their
own story. A closer model would be Diderot's once-famous Le Neveu de Rameau,
in which another dissolute dissident floats through another collapsing
social order.
At the Garrick Theatre Tim Hately's stage furnishings are minimal (but
crisply enhanced by lighting, sound and direction, respectively by Ian
Sommerville, John Irvine and Ian Brown). For almost two hours Courtenay
meanders and stumbles with rubber-legged grace on a long, sharply tilted
ramp, bare but for a crude bench. Without actorly displays, he conveys a
whole, wryly baffled character and his milieu, in a vodka-sodden baritone
that holds up beautifully to the challenge.
The Garrick is tolerably well suited to the show, though more intimate
surroundings would be better. If you go, sit close: the wealth of pawky
Courtenay touches that make it more than a staged radio monologue may be
partly lost on the back rows.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Arts: The Bourgeois Gentilhomme - Theatre / A 'Binglish'
version of Moliere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jatinder Verma Mughal transposition of Moliere's Tartuffe for the National
Theatre in 1990 drew universal plaudits. Now once more under the banner of
his own Tara Arts company, he has returned to the same fertile source.
Verma's adaptation of The Bourgeois Gentilhomme is set in the French colony
of Pondicherry in the southern India of the late 17th century. The merchant
Monsieur Jourdain, ludicrously eager to elevate himself socially, here
becomes successful fisherman Thirru Kaka Deen, hopelessly trying to buy in
bulk the frills and furbelows, airs and graces which will unlock to him the
world of the Annians, or French colonisers. In order to win his daughter's
hand after Kaka's first snobbish rebuff, her suitor impersonates not the
Great Turk but the Sun King himself.
Much play is made of Kaka Deen's desire to transform himself from a crow
(the literal meaning of his name) into a peacock, and Vincent Ebrahim makes
a fine strutting idiot, attempting to buy knowledge by the yard and
discovering, in the original play's most famous aphorism, that he has been
speaking prose all his life and never realised it.
Yet Verma's version is more than mere prose. He uses the term 'Binglish' (by
analogy with 'Bollywood', the common coinage for the Bombay movie industry)
to describe the fizzing East-West linguistic cocktail which his characters
speak. The likes of Salman Rushdie and Vikram Seth have conveyed the energy
of this modern vernacular on the page, but hearing a classic French comedy
rendered thus is another experience entirely.
The unaccustomed ear is never allowed to attune fully; Verma is alert to the
possibilities of 'Binglish' for ridicule, as Kaka Deen fails time and again
to master the formal 'received' speech of the nobles whose favour he craves,
and lapses back into his altogether livelier 'natural' lexicon.
This cheery verbal syllabub re-enacts the central message which Tara's
production elicits from the narrative: that energy, happiness and truth are
found in hybridity rather than in trying to attain a phoney alien propriety.
Kaka Deen is spoken of as would-be social 'coconut' - brown on the outside,
white on the inside - yet when the play reverts in the final moments to the
modern frame in which Verma has mounted it, the question, 'Are you a
coconut?' is met with a joyous affirmative 'Aren't we all?'
The change and interaction of words and cultures is to be embraced: at one
point a character quotes the central teaching of 20th-century guru, Meher
Baba; pauses; repeats it, and begins singing it . . . because that is what
we now associate with the phrase 'Don't worry, be happy,' that is what it
now means to us.
None of which is to damn the production as 'worthy'. The performance I saw
managed (eventually) to seduce even a resolutely Surrey-commuter-belt
audience at the Maltings, Farnham into going along with the larks. Moliere's
'comedie-ballet' is rendered with song (accompanied with an arsenal of
percussion by Joji Hirota), dance (choreographic consultant, Shobana
Jeyasingh) and a kind of semi-improvised puppetry, which sees Kaka Deen
exchanging flatteries with an aristocratic mango wearing a tricorn.
Verma's primary aim is celebration rather than profundity, and on that score
The Bourgeois Gentilhomme succeeds comfortably, thank you.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Technology: Working on unity - Attempts by IBM, Apple and
Motorola to create a new standard for PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Sculley, former Apple chairman and chief executive, called it 'the
foundation for a renaissance of technical innovation that will impact the
entire computer industry into the 21st century'.
'Together we announce the second decade of personal computing,' added Jack
Kuehler, then president of IBM.
It was October, 1991. The executives from International Business Machines,
Apple Computer as well as Motorola's semiconductor group stood together on a
San Francisco stage to announce a technology alliance many believed would
create a formidable challenge to Intel and Microsoft, the PC industry
duopoly.
IBM and Apple said that they would collaborate on a broad range of efforts
to create a new 'unified standard' for the next generation of personal
computers. Motorola would be the chip supplier to Apple and to any others
which might adopt the new standard.
Three years on, however, the vast majority of PCs are still based on the
Intel-Microsoft combination of chips and software that IBM, Apple and
Motorola aimed to overthrow. While the second decade of personal computing
is well underway, IBM and Apple are still battling to defend their
positions. The two companies that dominated the PC market in the 1980s now
have a combined market share of only about 20 per cent.
Although the alliance is deemed a success by its three members, IBM, Apple
and Motorola have so far failed to create the 'unified PC technology
standard' that was to be the centerpiece of their collaboration, the
platform upon which they would mount their attack on established PC industry
standards.
The technology partners got off to a strong start by delivering a family of
microprocessor chips called PowerPC, based on IBM's Reduced Instruction Set
Computing (RISC) technology and manufactured by IBM and Motorola. The chips
are smaller, faster and cost less to produce than Intel's latest Pentium
microprocessors.
Apple Computer steamed ahead of its alliance partners, launching a new range
of 'Power Macintosh' computers based on the first PowerPC chips in March.
The new computers have helped Apple to recover from shrinking sales and
profits.
For Motorola, the alliance has provided the core microprocessor technology
for a new generation of chips and salvaged its relationship with Apple - its
only microprocessor customer in the PC industry.
Other computer manufacturers including Toshiba and Canon of Japan and Groupe
Bull of France have announced plans to use PowerPC chips in future computer
products. Motorola is also renewing efforts in the computer market with a
range of 'PowerStack' computers based on the PowerPC chip, which the
electronics company aims to sell through third parties.
For IBM, however, the returns on sharing its chip technology with Motorola
and Apple have yet to be realised. The introduction of its range of 'Power
Personal' computers was recently delayed, for the second time, until next
year.
'PowerPC technology has capabilities that don't exist in the current (Intel)
technology in terms of speed,' said Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice president
and the new head of IBM's PC business, shortly before postponing the
introduction of the Power Personal PCs. 'But there are obvious negatives . .
. because it does not have an established base of application software.'
IBM's delay reflects a fundamental weakness in the alliance strategy.
Apple's 'Power Macintosh' computers are not compatible with PowerPC
computers designed by IBM and Motorola.
Despite sharing common microprocessor technology, the companies' computers
cannot run the same software.
Without software, a microprocessor is like a new car engine without wheels.
It may be an impressive feat of engineering, but it is of little practical
use.
'It all comes down to software, software, software,' says David Wu, a PC
industry analyst at SG Warburg.
To attract third-party software developers who can create applications
programs for PowerPC computers, the alliance partners must first establish
hardware standards that promise large volumes of compatible computers.
'It used to be that if you built a better mousetrap - a faster
microprocessor - then the applications would flood in. That is no longer
true. They (software developers) are looking for volume,' says Tom West,
senior vice-president of advanced development at Data General.
The IBM, Apple, Motorola alliance was flawed from the start, he suggests.
'There is so much ego, corporate identity, and mythology tied up with their
(microprocessor) chip agendas . . . Guys, you got it wrong.'
Analysts believe that only by aligning computer designs more closely can IBM
and Apple achieve the critical mass needed to attract a substantial portion
of the software development investment that is made in the PC industry.
IBM and Apple have been jousting for several months on this issue, with
Apple apparently resistant to changing the design of its Power Macintosh
computers and IBM equally determined to make its PowerPC designs the
industry standard. (Motorola's recently introduced PowerPC computers comply
with IBM's design.)
A breakthrough may be close. The companies have intensified their efforts to
reach an agreement and Apple said this week that it is 'optimistic' about
the outcome of ongoing talks. This has fuelled speculation that IBM might
cement its new pact with Apple with an equity investment.
A common hardware design is critical if IBM, Apple and Motorola are to
fulfil the promise of their 1991 alliance, enabling 'Power' computers to run
a wide range of applications programs - including those designed for Apple's
Macintosh or IBM's new OS/2 Warp PC operating system.
It could, however, take as long as two years for IBM, Apple and Motorola to
alter their computer designs and complete operating system software
development.
By then, Intel and Microsoft will surely throw new competitive challenges in
the path of the alliance partners.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Technology: New era for MS treatment / A look at two drugs
which may slow down the disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Multiple sclerosis patients and a handful of small drug companies developing
treatments for the disease may be about to enter a new era.
Sufferers of MS - the second most common neurological disease among young
adults - have this week been able to take heart from the results of clinical
trials on two new drugs revealed at the American Neurological Association
meeting in San Francisco.
Those results were good enough to make it likely that by 1996 there will be
several MS drugs on the market, compared with just one today. None is a cure
for the condition, but all appear to slow sharply the disease's progress.
For the suppliers, the results herald a period of tough competition. The
market will be worth Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 930m) annually by 1998, says
stockbroker Lehman Brothers. The battle for that revenue will centre on the
clinical trial results and the mesh of patents in the area.
There are four main suppliers: Germany's Schering which sells Betaseron,
Israel's Teva with Copaxone, and Switzerland's Ares Serono/Biogen of the US,
both with beta interferon.
For the past year only Betaseron has been approved for the treatment of MS.
It works by interfering with the immune system, thought to be at fault in
MS.
Betaseron is made by genetically engineered bacteria and is not quite
identical to beta interferon produced naturally in the human body.
Biogen and Ares Serono, on the other hand, use genetically engineered mammal
cells to make beta interferon that is chemically identical to the human
version. In principle, this should mean the drug works better in the human
body with, perhaps, fewer side effects.
The data published this week were the first large-scale trials, beta
interferon and Copaxone.
The results of the Biogen trial, on 301 MS sufferers, were probably not as
clear as the company would have liked. Direct comparisons with the results
of earlier Betaseron trials are difficult because the drugs are not compared
directly, only against placebos.
Side effects - flu-like symptoms - seem to be fewer with beta interferon.
But this could have been because patients in the Biogen trials were also
given paracetamol (Tylenol) to depress their fevers. Furthermore the
effectiveness of Biogen's drug was gauged by how fast patients' condition
deteriorated - it slowed the progress of the disease by almost half.
But Betaseron was tested by measuring the frequency of MS attacks. Here,
however, there was little to choose between the two drugs.
The US Food and Drug Administration and regulatory bodies elsewhere are
likely to examine closely such data. Biogen, whose shares fell after the
trials results were published, faces some tough questioning if it claims
superiority over Betaseron.
The patents covering beta interferon also seem set to be fought over. There
is a cascade of licensing agreement starting at research institutions in
Japan and California and involving Ares Serono sub-licencing one patent to
Biogen while Schering tries to use beta interferon (not Betaseron) in
another disease area, hepatitis.
Standing aloof from this is Teva, the Israeli company, whose Copaxone
appears to work in a different and ill-understood way. But it too achieved
only modestly encouraging results, cutting the number of MS attacks but by
less than that achieved by Betaseron. It may be safer than Betaseron or beta
interferon and could have a market for patients who have reacted badly to
the other two.
The message that emerged from San Francisco was that the principle of
interferons helping MS sufferers is good and life for those who take the
drugs may get a little easier. However, the drug companies face a bruising
battle with each other to win sales.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Technology: Better than a boring bike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exercise machines are hard work and time-consuming. They are also boring,
which is why health clubs are turning to virtual reality. A US manufacturer
has designed an exercise bike that allows the rider to interact with a
virtual reality world displayed on the screen, using a colour monitor at eye
level and thumb-controls in the handlebars.
The interactive, three- dimensional graphics give the exerciser the
impression of steering along bike paths, going up hills and entering
buildings. The illusion is limited, partly because the screen picture is a
cartoon-like representation and partly because it uses a monitor, which
covers 60 per cent of the users' field of vision.
Head-mounted displays allow greater vision, but if used for more than 20
minutes they can make people feel dizzy. Moreover, the designers considered
that putting on a head-mounted display that had recently been used by
someone else taking vigorous exercise was unappealing.
The machine creates some illusions by, for instance, allowing the rider to
lean left or right into turns and by changing the feel of the pedals,
depending on the terrain. It also blows a stream of air across the face,
which becomes stronger as the rider pedals faster.
The thumb-operated controls allow the rider to shift gears, brake, count
miles and view progress on a map. The VRBike can be linked to several
machines, so riders can exercise in groups or in competition.
CyberGear of Cambridge, Massachusetts, designed the software, which is
stored on a compact disc. The suppliers intend to develop discs with other
landscapes.
The bike, which was launched at a price of Dollars 8,000 (Pounds 5,330) in
the US in June, will be available in the UK at the start of next year. The
manufacturers are Tectrix Fitness Equipment of Irvine in California.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Muzak to the ears -
Virginia Matthews considers the arguments for background music everyone
loves to hate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Astronauts listened to it in the Apollo lunar spacecraft and it was the last
thing to be switched off in the American embassy as the US evacuation of
Saigon reached its climax.
Muzak, 60 years old this month, is to its critics inextricably linked to
'elevator music' - where Mantovani meets Liberace in achingly bland
disharmony.
Yet thanks to Muzak's thousands of clients, who consider customised music
more as a sales tool than noise pollutant, Muzak's product is far from being
stuck between floors.
Invented by Major General George Squier, a retired US army signals officer,
Muzak began as a dance medley service, played down telephone lines to
subscribers for 11 cents a month.
The notion of piped music was later seized on by the US's newly-influential
industrial psychologists, who saw it as a cost-effective way to increase
productivity in the workplace.
As worker motivation appeared to improve with melody, so too did the
enthusiasm of shoppers who appeared to linger longer and spend more.
Following a series of successful Muzak experiments in big New York stores, a
national phenomenon was under way.
Now, Muzak's 12 channels - only one, the 'environmental music channel' could
be described as elevator music, the rest being anything from contemporary
jazz to the Rolling Stones - have spread to aircraft, hotel lobbies and
restaurants, as well as to the waiting rooms of doctors and dentists.
Piped music has also spread to switchboards, which play the 'hold music'
that is designed to soothe irate callers, but which often raises, rather
than reduces blood pressure levels.
Curiously, Muzak has failed to thrive in Britain. For while its name is a
by-word for those who dislike background music, the self-proclaimed 'audio
icon' and 'tunesmith' from Cleveland Ohio, has not been in the UK since the
early 1980s, when its last UK franchise ran out.
'We are used to being blamed for all background music,' says Leslie Fitter,
the company's director of marketing.
'But as far as Britain goes, Muzak is blameless.'
While Muzak continues to supply tapes to more than 200 international
franchisees, mostly broadcasters, who receive the soundtracks via a
satellite link, the piped music that has invaded the UK is entirely the work
of others.
Be it 'acid jazz' music played full pelt at fashion retailer French
Connection, or Tommy Steele's Little White Bull keeping the tiny punters
amused at Mothercare, retailers instinctively know what appeals to their own
target audiences. Or do they?
Ritter, who hints that a significant UK franchise deal is imminent, argues:
'Nothing comes close to the expertise of a company that has specialised in
business music for 60 years. 'It's fine for a store manager to bring in his
favourite CD, but no one should pretend that any real thought goes into it.
'Our service begins with a full consultation with a senior Muzak executive
who finds out the demographic profile of the company, its desired atmosphere
and how it is currently perceived.
'We then recommend a programme that both meets the firm's music needs and
possibly includes a customised programme of marketing messages for use
inside the store or on the switchboard.'
If and when a deal with Muzak is struck in the UK, the full power of Muzak's
service will be unleashed: everything from the hitline channel of today's
top pop tracks, to the classical channel, country and western and oldies - a
blend of 1960s and 1970s music that seems to go down so well with baby
boomers.
If piped music is genuinely unpopular with consumers, as its critics would
have us believe, why do so many retailers continue to use it?
Harrods, which uses both 'hold music' and in-store piped music, says: 'If
music was a real irritant to our customers there is no way that we would
play it. After all, the idea is to open wallets and purses, not to get them
slammed shut.
'We believe that what people actually object to is this fashion for elevator
music or meaningless noise, the sort of thing we would never play in our
elevators or anywhere else for that matter.
'What is appreciated is music that is appropriate to the department . . .
anything that adds to the ambience, rather than distracting from it, is
welcomed by our customers.'
While Harrods plays it safe by having music-free zones on the ground and
first floors and in the lift areas, Mothercare's music is unmissable
throughout the store.
'Our research indicates that the majority of the customers who notice it
feel that the music adds to the enjoyment of their shopping trip,' says
Mothercare.
While 1990s industrial psychologists are less mesmerised by the power of
music than their 1930s counterparts, Muzak's claims continue. The latest
research from Cleveland suggests that piped music increases the number of
shoppers who make it to the cash till by 17 per cent.
In another study, two-thirds of customers say that Muzak is preferable to
silence, adding that customer service is 'bound to be better' in piped music
stores.
But of the consumers who walk out of stores or hang up just as soon as
Greensleeves starts up? Not a mention.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Red card for rules
on TV sport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government restrictions which prevent Wimbledon, the FA Cup and other big
British sporting events being shown on a pay-per-view basis on UK television
should be scrapped, a discussion paper argues today.
In the current edition of Consumer Policy Review* Philip Cullum, manager of
policy research at the Association of Consumer Research, says the 'listed
events' rules introduced under the 1990 Broadcasting Act 'work against the
interests of consumers'. They do not, for example, require consultation with
consumer groups on content of the list or grant consumers rights to see
events on television. Instead they protect established broadcasters against
satellite and cable company competition.
Cullum says that by handing exclusive rights to terrestrial broadcasters -
instead of simply removing exclusivity from the reach of pay-per-view
channels - the rule could deprive viewers of innovative new services.
He also argues that the system is anomalous - if Scotland played England at
football in the 1996 European Championship final 'the game might be shown on
a pay-per-view basis, but if Lithuania meets Liechtenstein in the next World
Cup finals the match could not be shown on a pay-per-view basis'.
At present satellite broadcasters like BSkyB, in which the Financial Times'
parent Pearson owns a stake, only offer subscription channels. The House of
Commons Heritage Select Committee, however, has recommended the relevant
section of the 1990 Act be extended to such channels. Cullum says it may be
appropriate to regulate televised sport in other ways. He thinks BSkyB's
charges should be closely monitored by the Office of Fair Trading.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Face to face with
the interactive future - Diane Summers finds consumer attitudes can affect
the development of new media and the influence of advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The techno-buffs may be talking excitedly about the convergence of
technologies, interactivity, the information superhighway and so on. But for
many, the concepts are absurdly futuristic and are to be feared. At the
opposite extreme, some consumers are already bored even before the
technology has become a reality.
Consumer attitudes will clearly affect how new media develop, who users are
and how much influence advertisers will be able to wield. Researchers at the
London office of advertising agency Ogilvie and Mather decided, therefore,
to explore through discussions with groups of consumers, what attitudes are
forming.
To begin with, the very notion of 'convergence' between televisions and
computers appears to be distasteful to many. While the techno-buffs are
striving to pull everything together, consumers are fighting to push them
apart. The group discussions highlighted the way in which the computer is
seen as synonymous with work, while the TV equates with leisure. The last
thing many people want is for the two to be confused - a fear particularly
strong among 'techno-literate' consumers.
The research, which was conducted for O&amp;M by the Hallam Hopper group, was
unveiled yesterday. Four sets of group discussions, each of three hours
duration, were held with British adults, while two, two-hour groups of 13
and 14-year-olds were also held. Researchers also talked to 16 and
17-year-old 'computer literate' young adults. All groups had access to, for
example, CD-Rom, and were able to play games, explore a 3-D atlas and thumb
through an interactive Argos shopping catalogue.
The groups were also shown a futuristic film of a world where portable
screens would be used to conduct a face-to-face meeting, go shopping, carry
out an operation and redesign a building. The technology which was presented
through a soap opera-style story in the film, still appeared to leave room
for traditional family values and meaningful personal relationships.
Not surprisingly, some of the discussion group members found it difficult to
project themselves into such scenes or the science fiction realms of, for
example, virtual reality. Others were cynical about the differences that
would be made to their lives.
Beth Barry, O&amp;M planning director, says this cynicism is born of experience:
'Ten years ago we were told everybody was going to have hundreds of channels
on their television and that video recorders were going to change our lives
because we'd all be timeshifting.' The reality is that only about 17 per
cent of UK households have cable or satellite and video recorders are mostly
used for watching pre-recorded films, she says.
People's ability to reduce everything to a 'so what' should never be
under-estimated, says Barry. There were comments from the group such as: 'So
you can tap into your TV and order up a bottle of Dettol. But, in the end,
what you're left with is still a bottle of Dettol.'
The technology might be perceived as mundane in certain respects, but the
group discussions also unearthed the usual fears about 'the machines taking
over' - expressed by the adult technophobes. There were also fears about
drowning in information, as well as losing high-quality British TV and the
surprises it can offer.
The positioning of converging technologies are vitally important to
advertisers - whether, for example, entertainment services, home shopping
and banking are seen to be extensions of the TV or the computer.
If consumer perceptions are that the information superhighway will be routed
principally through the TV then the mass market is there to be tapped.
However, if advertisers seek the more up-market audiences, there will be
more benefit in emphasising the technology's computer pedigree.

FT  13 OCT 94 / People: Iceland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Hinchcliffe, 47, one of the founders of the Iceland frozen food chain,
is stepping down as joint managing director, thus ending a 24-year
partnership which started when he and Malcolm Walker, 48, Iceland's chairman
and chief executive, opened their first shop in Oswestry.
Hinchcliffe (pictured in Iceland's warehouse at Shotton) and Walker were
both deputy managers of Woolworth stores in North Wales; in their spare time
they sold strawberries to passing motorists on the Horseshoe Pass. In 1970
they went into business full time and have built up a chain of almost 700
stores in the UK.
Hinchcliffe says he wants to reduce his involvement in the company in order
to pursue other business interests. He will retire as joint managing
director and deputy chairman at the end of the year. He will remain a
non-executive director and has been retained as a consultant for two years.
He says he has no plans to reduce his shareholding of around 3 per cent in
Iceland.

FT  13 OCT 94 / People: Cawthra quits Miller Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Cawthra is to step down as ceo of the Miller Group, the
Edinburgh-based construction company, after three years in the post, and
hand over to Keith Miller, a member of the family which owns it. His
departure was by mutual consent, the company says.
Cawthra, 51, joined Miller Group from Balfour Beatty where he was ceo for
three years having been with the company since 1979. He was appointed by
James Miller who stepped down as ceo but remained chairman.
At the time Cawthra said he wanted to make Miller bigger 'both in size and
in its worth to the shareholders', and saw 'big opportunities' for up and
coming companies 'which seem to have been hit less hard by recession than
have the large ones'. But Miller was not immune to the economic downturn and
in 1993 lost Pounds 11.9m including exceptional items.
Yesterday he said it 'had always been my expectation that a time would arise
when it would be appropriate for Keith to take over and I fully agree that
that time has now been reached'. He has no new job to go to and will work at
Miller till the end of the year.
The company said both parties felt it was time for Miller to be led once
again by a member of the family. Cawthra's departure did not presage any
nasty surprises in the current year's results, it said.
Keith Miller, 45, has been responsible for the group's mining activities in
the UK and US and yesterday learnt that Scotcoal, its joint venture with
Ryan Mining, had been unsuccessful in its bid for the assets of British Coal
in Scotland. He is also md of Miller Developments which handles all the
group's commercial property ventures and investments. Educated at Heriot
Watt and Glasgow universities, he has worked with Miller Group since 1976.
Keith Miller is the younger son of the late John Miller, one of the three
founding shareholders of the Group and a first cousin of James Miller.

FT  13 OCT 94 / People: Pennington's flight path to Royal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance has appointed a marketing specialist as managing director of
The Insurance Service, its direct writing insurance arm.
Sydney Pennington is a former sales and marketing executive of retail group
Marks &amp; Spencer and, more recently, former joint managing director of
Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
Royal was one of the first composite insurers to follow the market leader
Direct Line Insurance by setting up a direct insurance arm; but competition
has increased as others have started to sell insurance policies via the
telephone and advertising.
Royal Insurance is hoping Pennington, 49, will raise the profile of The
Insurance Service, which started in 1988 and currently insures more than
400,000 private motorists and households.
The time is now right, says Pennington, 'to go into the next stage which
will be a more rapid period of growth'. He expects the company to develop
and expand sales of new products, particularly in house insurance, and also
to try to increase the amount of business it conducts with each customer.
With direct insurers breaking down the traditional method of buying policies
via brokers, Pennington's previous experience in building customer links
will prove helpful; at Marks &amp; Spencer he was involved in the development of
the group's 'neighbourhood' food stores; at Virgin he helped develop the
group's Megastores.
One disadvantage Pennington faces is The Insurance Service's relatively
little known brand name. Last year Royal Insurance began a pilot project
using the title Royal Insurance Direct. For now, Royal Insurance appears
content to run the two as separate operations; it believes that each may be
able to target different client groups.

FT  13 OCT 94 / People: New partners at Goldman Sachs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Sherwood, 29, one of the driving forces behind Goldman Sachs' rise
up the Eurobond league tables, has been rewarded for returning to the fold
by being made a partner of Goldman Sachs.
Sherwood, who quit Goldman at the start of the year only to rejoin the firm
a month later, and Richard Sharp, son of the late Lord Sharp, the former
chairman of Cable and Wireless, are two of the 11 new London-based general
partners elected to the 125-year-old partnership.
Goldman is the largest private partnership remaining among the major US
investment banking and brokerage firms. Its partners are reputed to earn a
minimum of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m a year - hence competition for
the biennial ritual of elevation to the partnership is fierce. This year
Goldman appointed 58 new general partners, more than ever before.
Apart from Sherwood and Sharp, Goldman's new London-based partners are:
David Blood, Treasury, operations, technology and accounting; Zachariah
Cobrinik, Japanese equity link trading; Gary Cohn, metals trading; Michael
Evans, equity capital markets; Scott Kapnick, corporate finance; Scott Mead,
IBS communications and technology; Kipp Nelson, derivatives triple joint
venture; Wiet Pot, Euro share sales; Anthony Williams, derivatives triple
joint venture.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: Opening the books and limiting liability
 -Jim Kelly examines the ramifications for accountants of Peat Marwick's
move towards incorporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with the uncovering of secrets is that it often disappoints. One
of the big secrets in the accountancy profession is how much the partners at
the big firms earn. Thanks to KPMG Peat Marwick's historic decision to
support incorporation of its audit arm we are about to find out.
We will, I suspect, be disappointed. The independently audited accounts of
Peat Marwick Audit plc, or whatever it may be called, will probably reveal
earnings for partners of a modest kind. KPMG appears confident the figures
will not raise eyebrows.
What has caused a stir is its decision, if supported by its clients, to be
the first accountancy firm of any size to move away from the confidential
world of the partnership. Its declared aim is to limit the exposure of
partners to legal actions. Those in a partnership face joint and several
liability when, for example, an audited corporate client collapses.
Disclosure will draw back the veil on KPMG's business for both clients and
competitors. This is one of the penalties KPMG is prepared to pay to limit
liability. They are also prepared to reveal a full financial statement for
the rest of the business: a bold undertaking which has caught some
competitors on the wrong foot.
There are other penalties to partial incorporation. The increased tax burden
on partners in the company is not inconsequential - although the benefits of
partnership are not what they were and will diminish further. It is also
likely that all Peat's partners, both inside and outside the audit practice,
will share the financial burden.
So taxation and disclosure are the immediate penalties. KPMG, and its
clients, might also fear that the partnership ethos will be lost within the
corporate framework. KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman has obviously
decided that his partners do not need the fear of liability as a spur to
commitment. Corporate management structures, after all, also have
advantages. Most large partnerships with international links have moved
toward a corporate structure.
KPMG's competitors are likely to see other disadvantages to partial
incorporation: after all, despite a lot of movement behind the scenes, none
of them looks likely to follow suit in the short term. There are certainly
doubts within KPMG itself, where there is some disquiet up to partner level,
and possibly beyond.
But the real problem with the KPMG option is that it does not solve the one
problem which threatens the very existence of some of the big firms  - the
explosion in claims against auditors under joint and several liability. In
1983 litigation as a proportion of audit costs for the eight largest firms
was 2.6%. In 1993 it was 8 per cent and rising.
In 1983 the six biggest firms faced three claims. In 1993 they faced 210
with 600 still open at the end of the year. In the past 10 years three out
of five corporate collapses resulted in action against the auditor.
Earlier this year the big eight, including Peat Marwick, put a submission to
the Department of Trade and Industry urging reform of Section 310 of the
Companies Act 1985 to allow the limitation of liability for auditors. The
report noted that: 'Incorporation of accounting firms does not provide an
effective solution.'
Incorporation does not tackle the heart of the problem because the company
can still be sued; in fact it can still be brought to destruction. Also
those partners directly involved in negligent work are still liable. Legal
advice about the extent of this liability is variable but crucial. For
example: Is the accountant who trained the auditor who produced negligent
work also liable? Is the immediate manager liable? Is the consultant liable?
If the American experience, in which the leading accountancy firms have
become Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP), provides any precedent, it is
that liability would be strictly limited.
Expert opinion on the question of liability in the LLPs points to the
conclusion that direct supervision would need to be proved to extend
liability.
In the British context it appears that KPMG believes the law would follow
similar reasoning. KPMG is also likely to see pursuit of partners in its
audit arm as the second option for claimants after they have tackled the
company.
Another problem with incorporation as a counter-balance to liability is that
the partners are not protected from prior actions against them lodged before
incorporation. This is enough in itself to take the icing off of the
corporate cake for most of the Big Six.
There are other disadvantages. Being first, KPMG will take most of the pain
and some of the costs for the rest of the profession. When it comes to
disclosing full financial results for the business KPMG will be under
pressure to have them independently audited - hardly an inviting option.
So why has KPMG taken the plunge? The reorganisation of a business is
usually either superficial, as in the case of the LLP's in the US, or
profoundly structural, in order to gain competitive advantage.
What has KPMG to gain from what appears to be a halfway house? After all,
the new audit arm will fit into KPMG's exisiting structure admirably.
Competitors muse that the production of full financial results for the audit
arm will allow KPMG to declare to major customers the strength of its
financial resources to meet future claims.
Transparency will also remove suspicion from fee negotiations. Mr Sharman
seems more than happy to face new customers with his company's results on
the table.
KPMG are canvassing clients on incorporation but reactions seem generally
positive. Alan Spall, finance director of ICI, gauges his views as 'neutral
to positive'. His concerns are over adequate capitalisation and maintainance
of standards.
KPMG has clearly won itself a head start on incorporation and a distinctive
image in a market place often seen as bland and anonymous. But the firm is
just as aware as its competitors that incorporation is not the final answer.
Another incomplete option, not available under British law, is the move in
the US towards LLPs. One leading partner admits that if the legislation was
available in the UK he would move to LLP status overnight. Registration in
the US costs Dollars 100 per partner.
Interestingly, one of the few requirements for LLP status is the need to
demonstrate that the partnership provides Dollars 1m of liability insurance
or Dollars 1m of funds set aside to meet claims. But here again partners are
still liable for commercial debts and direct negligence.
Given the absence of the LLP option in Britain, KPMG has taken the only
viable action left to a firm which wants to act now. There are those in the
profession who privately say that KPMG, in going for the audit incorporation
option, has damaged the campaign for reform of the law on liability. That
campaign is currently stalled while the government considers the
professions' call for legal reform.
Meanwhile accountants will continue to work in the shadow liability. Graham
Ward, a partner in Price Waterhouse, and chairman of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants' working group on liability, sees a 'fundamental
imbalance' in the economics of auditing, in which the risks do not match
rewards.
KPMG's initiative, while courageous and potentially astute if it captures
the imagination of clients, does little to redress that balance. It does,
however, promise to put more accountability into accounting.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (9): Business users come first / A look
at progress in the telecommunications sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria's responsibility for developing an electronics industry under the
former Comecon division of labour helps explain why the country ranks first
in telephone density among the former socialist countries, with 34 lines per
100 population. But expansion from only 14 lines per 100 in 1980 was
achieved through obsolete analogue equipment whose design dated back almost
half a century.
Bulgaria has now started modernising its national and international
telecommunications infrastructure with plans for a digital overlay network
(Don). These plans include 1,700km of optic fibre lines, microwave links, a
new international gateway, 11 long-distance exchanges, local exchanges and
the earth satellite station system Intelsat.
Almost 50 bidders tendered for the first six projects within the Don
programme. Siemens of Germany was awarded contracts for a new international
digital exchange as well as trunk and local digital exchanges in northern
Bulgaria. Northern Telecom of Canada won a tender for an optical fibre line
in western Bulgaria and Satellite Transmissions Systems (STS) of the US was
awarded the contract for the construction of an Intelsat ground station.
Sweden's Ericsson Telefon was commissioned for the construction of trunk and
local digital exchanges in southern Bulgaria while a contract for the
installation of an optical fibre trunk line in the eastern part of the
country was awarded to Alcatel Cable of France. A tender is expected shortly
for the last project - the building of a digital microwave trunk network.
According to Antony Slavinski - the Bulgarian Telecommunications Company
(BTC) vice-president of network planning and implementation who is in charge
of the Don programme - much of the equipment from western suppliers has
already arrived. By the end of this year work on some of the projects will
be almost completed. When all elements of the network are completed, by
1996, it will service 150,000 subscribers, mainly business users in larger
cities.
Providing high-quality business services is a priority. Profits from
business subscribers will help generate more funds for the subsequent
modernisation of the residential network, which is expected to achieve
European standards by the year 2008.
About half of the Dollars 300m needed for the Don project has to be raised
by BTC. The remainder is being provided by the European Investment Bank -
Ecu70m (Dollars 86.80m) - the World Bank - Dollars 30m - and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development - Ecu32m (Dollars 39.68m). The loans
have to be repaid in 15 to 20 years with grace periods of five to six years.
Modernisation will involve higher prices and the telecommunications
authorities have proposed regular increases in telephone charges. Since May
1993, charges have also been affected by the rapid Lev depreciation and have
risen by 150 per cent.
BTC says it is vital that tariffs reflect costs as BTC owes foreign
telecommunications administrations Dollars 25m, but few Bulgarian customers
realise that high-quality telecommunications is expensive and European
standards can only be attained by heavy investment financed by higher
prices.
Legislative delays remain a drag on progress. A draft law has been ready for
two years but 'by the time it is adopted by parliament, it will be outdated
and will have to be amended', says Mr Slavinski.
'In order to carry on restructuring the sector, we use the golden rule that
whatever is not forbidden by the law is allowed,' he adds.
Meanwhile telecommunications sub-sectors such as mobile, radio wave and
cable links are being deregulated as national and regional licences are
awarded to domestic companies or consortia including both Bulgarian and
foreign companies. Each sub-sector is expected to have two operators in
future - one private, and one controlled by the state.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (10): Investment is forthcoming
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Bulgaria has not revealed plans for privatisation of the
telecommunications sector, foreign investment has been forthcoming both in
services and manufacturing.
Betkom, the first western telecommunications joint venture in the country,
was set up between the UK's GPT, a supplier of intelligent pay phones, and
Bulgaria's committee of Posts and Telecommunications. GPT, a partnership
between two of the world's leaders in telecoms - GEC of the UK and Siemens
AG of Germany - holds a 41.1 per cent stake in Betkom.
According to John Murgatroid, Betkom manager, the growth of the joint
venture since the initial equity investment worth Dollars 437,000 has been
on a self-financing basis - profits are reinvested in expanding the network.
The number of card phones installed is expected to reach 1,000 by the end of
the year, compared to just 100 in 1991, Betkom's first year of operation.
Another significant development is Bulgaria's first cellular network which
was launched earlier this year by a Bulgarian-British joint venture between
Cable &amp; Wireless (49 per cent), BTC (39 per cent) and state-owned company
Radio Electronic Systems (12 per cent). Known under its trade name,
Mobilfon, the network provides direct mobile connections for Bulgaria's
largest cities with more than 70 countries and has attracted more than 4,500
subscribers.
Mobiltel, a recently established consortium including Siemens, US West and
the Bulgarian financial group Tron is emerging as the main competitor to
Mobilfon.
The consortium has been licensed to build a GSM digital cellular wireless
network and plans to cover 80 per cent of the country by 1998. Some of the
components for the establishment of the Mobiltel network are expected to be
produced by Digicom, a joint venture between Siemens and Incoms Holding of
Bulgaria for the production, installation, and maintenance of switching and
transmission systems.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (8): Slow progress on sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The sale of Bulgaria's most prestigious Black Sea hotel, the five-star Grand
Hotel Varna, has been the biggest privatisation investment by a Bulgarian
company to date. A 49 per cent stake was sold earlier this year to
Multigroup, one of Bulgaria's most powerful private holding companies and
Balkanbank, one of the country's five biggest mainly state-owned banks for
Lev509m (about Dollars 10m at the time).
Under the scheme adopted by the privatisation agency, employees were offered
20 per cent of shares at a preferential price and the remaining 31 per cent
were floated.
'Since privatisation we are targeting a higher spending segment of the
market,' says Dotko Dotkov, the newly appointed general director. 'As a
private company, we can develop a proper investment programme to upgrade
several floors with special 'business class' rooms, and provide higher
quality service and better promotion through western tour operators.'
In spite of resistance from different groups, the privatisation agency has
announced the coming sale of other hotels including the Vitosha Grand Hotel
Sofia, and Rodina, as well as several hotels in winter and spa resorts and
some of the country's biggest Black Sea resorts, such as Sunny Beach and
Albena, which are offered for sale en bloc.
Foreign groups such as Daewoo of South Korea, Delta France, Holiday Inn,
Ramada, Radisson and Styles Hotels, as well as powerful Bulgarian financial
and industrial groups such as TSBank, Tron and Multigroup have shown
interest while ITT Sheraton has applied to buy the Sheraton Sofia Hotel
Balkan which it has managed for the past few years.
Years of recession and power struggles between the privatisation agency and
local tourism officials mean sell-offs are not going smoothly. Managers of
state-owned hotels and resorts fear they may lose their jobs and claim
privatisation will benefit foreign investors by selling the most profitable
hotels at give-away prices. But western consultants emphasise the need for
speedy privatisation. At present the 3,000 private sector tourism-related
companies account for only 10 per cent of total turnover.
Meanwhile Balkan Bulgarian Airlines, the national carrier, which transports
most Bulgarian visitors with its fleet of 58 aircraft is also up for sale.
The state will retain 40 per cent and at least 51 per cent shares of the
airline will be left in Bulgarian hands. The privatisation agency recently
rejected an offer by Avicon, an Austrian-Swiss company, to provide know-how
but no cash for a 49 per cent stake.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (7): Western visitors lead the way -
Theodor Troev finds that prospects for the tourist industry are picking up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russians are back, enjoying their holidays in some of the best resorts
along Bulgaria's sandy Black Sea coast - not shepherded in large groups as
they were under the communist regime, but strolling around with the
self-confidence of big spenders.
'Now everybody wants to attract Russians,' says Dotko Dotkov, general
director of Grand Hotel Varna, Bulgaria's only five-star hotel on the Black
Sea, and the first to be privatised earlier this year.
Ironically, it is often German tour companies that are bringing the Russians
back. Big operators, such as TUI, have become aware of the reviving market
in what was for decades the Riviera of the former Eastern bloc and their
branch offices in Russia - better organised than local competitors - have
been more successful than most in selling Bulgarian holidays.
But the recent increase in arrivals from the east has not yet reversed a
trend which began after the collapse of communism. Until then, Bulgaria had
been forced into the lower end of the mass tourism market with cheap package
holidays in block-like hotels. More than 60 per cent of tourists then came
from Eastern bloc countries.
Since 1990, the number of Russian and east European visitors has dropped to
less than 15 per cent of the total while western markets have picked up. The
number of travellers from western Europe grew by 28 per cent last year when
the overall number of visitors rose to 2.4m from 872,000 in 1992.
Most of these come from Germany (with a market share of more than 40 per
cent) and Britain (with a market share of more than 25 per cent) followed by
Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark.
No official figures are available for this year but there is strong visual
evidence of a sharp rise after a slow start.
The main state-owned tour operators, Balkantourist whose name until 1990 was
synonymous with the country's travel industry, and Balkan Holidays, with
subsidiaries in 17 countries, have reported increased demand throughout the
season. Seaside and mountain resorts, which have started negotiating
directly with foreign partners, as well as most private operators, also
report a steady flow of business.
Tourism managers have started to pay more attention to the long-term image
of the country and managed to prevent double-booking this summer. Last year,
Bulgaria received bad publicity when some customers of Balkan Holidays, the
main agency for the UK, arrived on the Black Sea to find their rooms
occupied by higher-paying German visitors.
Problems of this sort are not uncommon at a time when Bulgaria's travel
industry is trying to make the bold step from state ownership to free market
and private initiative. The first steps led to chaos, largely due to the
lack of a clear tourism policy and the power struggle between institutions
such as the Committee of Tourism, the Privatisation Agency, and the still
powerful managers of state-owned resorts and hotels.
Western consultants who have looked into Bulgaria's leisure industry
identify drawbacks such as poor quality of service and infrastructure, some
unsafe hotels and inhospitable airports. Only 6 per cent of the country's
high class hotels were estimated to meet European standards. Substantial
investment will be needed to upgrade them and attract a more up-market
clientele.
But officials are optimistic about the long-term potential of the industry.
The country is only just starting to promote its wealth of Thracian, Roman
and Byzantine remains, monasteries and mountains.
Apart from cheap summer seaside or winter skiing packages, Bulgarian tour
operators can also offer special interest tours, focusing on traditional
architecture, history, religion, arts, hunting and rural tourism.
Picturesque little towns on the Black Sea such as Nessebur and Sozopol,
built over ancient Thracian and Greek ports, now offer holidays in
residents' houses matching Greek islands-style vacations. Untapped
opportunities also exist in spa treatment, motor touring and green tourism,
as well as in conference travel.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (6): Reason for optimism - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Returning agriculture into private hands has so far been more of a
disruption than a stimulus to production, and has not yet led to the
expected revival of a sector which has declined in relative importance but
still accounts for about one fifth of gross domestic product and 20 per cent
of employment.
The dismantling of state co-operatives by government-appointed liquidation
committees since 1991 initially brought chaos to much of the countryside.
Farm output in 1992 fell by almost 15 per cent but now there has been a
reaction to early excesses.
'Co-operative is not a dirty word, no matter how our politicians speculate
with it,' says Georgy Tanev, the outgoing minister of agriculture who has
been in charge of this sector for the past two years. 'Bulgarians have been
used to working in co-operatives for decades. We cannot do without them, at
least for another five years,' he adds.
He claims it is not just peasants who support new-style co-operatives but
many UDF supporters also realise that they cannot survive without some form
of rural co-operation.
'The liquidation committees (set up to dismantle the co-operatives) almost
managed to liquidate our agriculture, especially stock-breeding,' Mr Tanev
says. Some of the committees lacked experience in agriculture and sold off
the co-operatives' fodder before returning animals to individual farmers.
Animals were also returned before land was redistributed and peasants had
the means to feed and breed them. As a result hundreds of thousands of pigs,
sheep and cattle have been slaughtered over the past two years.
The 1991 land law aimed at the restitution of land to those who owned it
before 1946 when the communist regime forced collectivisation on farmers.
But about 60 per cent of the new land owners now live in cities and towns
and many are unable or unwilling to return to farming. Some work their newly
returned plots of land only at weekends, using spades and wooden ploughs.
Lack of money and the small size of holdings usually prevent them from using
machines.
According to Mr Tanev, the average size of the newly returned plots is just
1.6 hectares, too small for modern technology. 'The new land owners have
three options: to sell the land, lease it or form a co-operative with other
owners,' he says. But no real land market exists yet and leasing the land
has not become a widespread practice due to the lack of proper legislation.
'What remains is to form new co-operatives,' says Mr Tanev. He points out
that co-operative farms in Bulgaria were not a communist invention. Some
have a century-long history.
The Souhindol co-operative in central Bulgaria, set up in 1909, is a good
example of how such a venture can thrive under market conditions.
Through restitution, its property has been returned to the former workers
but the re-formed co-operative has developed new meat processing works,
bakeries, vineyards, and bought new animals. Representatives of the
Bulgarian-American Enterprise Fund recently visited Souhindol and were
surprised by its efficient operation.
Such success stories indicate that the sector can recover. Another reason
for optimism is the fact that the decline in stock-breeding has gradually
led to higher meat purchase prices, giving fodder producers and animal
breeders more incentives.
Powerful private groups, such as Prime Investment Trust, have started
positioning themselves in the sector and executive director Ivo Ivanov says
the group is preparing a programme for investment in fodder production,
flour mills, sugar plants and meat processing.
Agriculture ministry experts believe that the 1994 decline in output will be
smaller than in the previous three years but UDF spokesmen, along with some
western experts, believe that substantial recovery of agriculture will only
be possible when people receive full legal title to their land. Only then
will smaller plots be sold and consolidated into more viable farms. The free
market, and not government attempts to reform the old co-operatives, should
be the driving force, they add. It may take another year before land
restitution is completed.
Early last year, government officials said the land reform plan would be
completed by the end of 1993, but this month agriculture ministry sources
revealed that only half the farmland had been returned with the full title
by the end of September and only 60 per cent will be returned by the end of
this year.
Meanwhile privatisation of state owned agricultural enterprises is now
moving ahead slowly. The ministry of agriculture has opened privatisation
procedures for 90 units, but deals have been completed for only 30 so far,
including pig farms, poultry farms, mills, machine repair works, and
fisheries.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (4): Early vote called for / A look at
the political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In October 1992 - when the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF)
government headed by Philip Dimitrov lost power and the country passed to
the hands of a 'government of technocrats' headed by Lyuben Berov -
believers in a smooth transition to democracy were dealt a sharp blow. Since
then the Bulgarian politics has been essentially on hold.
Mr Berov's government was supported by the parliamentary votes of the
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), the renamed home of the former communists,
as well as the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF) which is supported by
Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish minority and, sporadically, by the splinter groups
which have hived off from the two rival mainstream groups, the BSP and the
UDF over the past two years of political drift and disillusionment.
Mr Berov held on to power long enough to oversee the successful conclusion
of debt reduction negotiations with the Paris and London clubs of creditors.
But the 69-year-old former professor, who recovered well from a heart attack
in March, felt increasingly isolated from an electorate frustrated by lack
of progress in building the institutions of a market economy and threatened
by rising criminality. He survived six no-confidence votes tabled by the UDF
over the past 12 months and resigned at the start of September.
Zhelyu Zhelev, the president, immediately began negotiations with the two
main political groupings, but they declined his offer to try and form a new
government.
Both parties have been calling for early elections, although a large number
of individual deputies, doubting their chances of re-election and anxious to
secure their pension and other privileges, privately express reluctance to
go to the polls before the current parliamentary terms ends in October 1995.
Some BSP leaders are also reluctant to assume power and responsibility while
many acute social, economic and political problems remain unsolved.
But the BSP's insistence that early elections are preferable to another
interim government chosen by the president has more conviction than that of
the UDF because opinion polls indicate that an early vote would bring the
BSP back to power, albeit without the overall majority needed to govern
alone. This prospect is deeply distasteful to President Zhelev who began his
political career as one of the leaders of the UDF but disagreed with the
policies and tactics pursued by Mr Dimitrov and ended as a critic of both
leading parties.
In return the president, who now comes in second place behind the exiled
King Simeon in public opinion polls, is criticised for his 'byzantine'
behind-the-scenes manoeuverings which in recent weeks included meetings with
top military leaders to ensure their loyalty and impartiality in the tense
months which lie ahead.
The partial disintegration of the UDF, an umbrella organisation which
originated as a loose anti-communist coalition of nearly 20 groups and
emerged as the largest political force in the 1991 elections, left the BSP
as the largest single party in the present parliament. The BSP has also
suffered defections but still holds 99 of the 240 seats in the Narodno
Sobranie, the People's Assembly, against only 78 for the UDF.
A further 19 seats are held by the ethnic Turk MRF with the remainder split
between two smaller groups, New Choice, a handful of liberal conservatives
headed by Dimiter Ludzhev and the Democratic Alternative for the Republic
(DAR) a small centre-left party, plus about 20 independent, non-party MPs.
The refusal of the two major parties to form a government in succession to
Mr Berov obliged President Zhelev to make one final effort to comply with
his constitutional duty by calling on Mr Ludzhev, the leader of 'New Choice'
to try his luck. The New Choice leader has been a close friend and ally of
the president for the past 15 years. At the time of writing the outcome of
his effort to form a government was not known, but the most likely
conclusion to the crisis appeared to be new elections before Christmas, or
possibly early in the new year.

</HEADLINE>

Foreign companies have been quick to see the potential in modernising
Bulgaria's once flourishing food and agro-processing industries. The
privatisation programme began with the Dollars 20m trade sale of a maize
products plant in Razgrad, north eastern Bulgaria to Amylum, owned by CIP of
Belgium, Archer Daniels Midland Co. of the US, and Tate &amp; Lyle of the UK.
They were quickly followed by other multinational food-processing groups
including Kraft Jacobs Suchard and Nestle, which acquired leading chocolate
producers in Sofia, and Delta, a Greek food manufacturer, which invested in
an ice cream factory in Varna on the Black Sea.
Danone of France set up Danone-Serdika in Sofia for the manufacture of dairy
products while the Dutch company Frisoso is reported to be interested in
Bulgaria's largest diet and baby foods producer, Slancho. Danish investors
are investing in meat-processing and several Austrian companies plan
investment in turkey farms and asparagus growing.
Apart from private investment, western governmental aid and credits from the
international institutions are also becoming available for the agricultural
sector. The World Bank's first agricultural credit - a Dollars 50m loan to
improve private sector access to medium and long-term credit - was
negotiated by the ministry of agriculture earlier this year. It has not yet
been ratified by parliament, however, because of political infights over the
bank's requirement to phase out agricultural subsidies.
'Agriculture is one of the sectors with the most potential,' says Andrew
Kenningham, an economist who has spent several years as director of
Bulgarian International Business Association, representing foreign
investors.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (3): Plenty of hurdles remain -
Privatisation has had limited success so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Bulgaria's mass privatisation programme (MPP), based on the Czech model
using vouchers and private investment funds, suffered a severe blow before
it even got off the ground when the rival privatisation agency took more
than 35 most promising state companies in the MPP list for direct sale to
foreign and domestic investors.
Legislation to set up the MPP was approved just before the government
resigned, but Dimiter Stefanov, the executive director of the Centre for
Mass Privatisation, admits that much technical work remains to be done
before vouchers with a nominal value of 25,000 'investment Leva' can be
distributed to those willing to pay Lv500 for privatisation coupons. Even
then a big effort will be required to arouse popular enthusiasm for the
scheme.
In the meantime Reneta Indjova, the tough-minded executive director of the
privatisation agency, is forging ahead with privatisation by direct sale to
investors, a method which has already privatised 30 medium- to large-sized
state-owned enterprises, of which the biggest and most recent is the Dollars
55m purchase by the German transport entrepreneur Willi Betz of a
controlling 55 per cent stake in Somat, Europe's biggest trucking company.
The Somat deal, like most other deals to date, promises substantial future
investment and job guarantees. But thus far the benefit to the Bulgarian
treasury from privatisation has been limited. 'Net revenues from
privatisation to date are probably no more than Dollars 20m. But some
Dollars 1.5bn in enterprise debt has been written off as a result of
privatisation while the prospects for penetrating new markets and attracting
further greenfield investment have improved,' says Ms Indjova.
Meanwhile the agency is hoping that the recent foreign debt reduction
agreements, with their provision for debt/equity swaps, will stimulate the
interest of foreign investors in state-owned assets with potential for
growth once old debts are cleared and new management methods and equipment
are installed.
Ms Indjova is anxious to speed up the process as much as possible, largely
because the negative effect of delay is only too obvious. Given the slowness
of formal privatisation, Bulgarian state and municipal enterprises have been
subjected to a wave of 'hidden privatisation' which has alienated a large
but unquantifyable amount of the choicest state or municipally-owned assets.
'It is impossible to calculate the loss accurately, but hidden privatisation
reduces the net worth of enterprises and is reflected in rising
inter-enterprise debt, the high level of debt to commercial banks and
ultimately adds to the budget deficit, driving inflation and crowding out
the private sector,' she says.
Such 'hidden privatisation' usually involves the formation of private
companies to supply state enterprises with inputs at high prices and other
companies take their subsidised output for resale at market prices. In this
way enterprises accumulate inter-company debts and losses while allowing a
new class of millionaire 'biznismen' to cream off economic rents.
The process of nationalising losses and privatising profits is widespread
throughout the former Soviet bloc but has been most blatant in countries
such as Bulgaria or Romania where the continuing influence of former
communists, coupled with the weakness of the law and the inexperience of
civil society has been most pronounced.
In Bulgaria's case what is popularly perceived as the 'mafia-isation' of the
economy has been further stimulated by the baleful side-effects of the UN
embargo on trade with Serbia and the Greek embargo on trade with the former
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
Small but powerful groups of Serbs, Macedonians and Bulgarians have made
quick fortunes by smuggling oil, weapons and a wide range of other
commodities across the borders by a variety of ingenious methods which
mostly include the bribing of police, customs and other officials at some
stage.
'The war in former Yugoslavia has been a disaster for Bulgaria. I seriously
doubt whether a country like the Czech republic would be so law-abiding if
it had borders like ours,' says Alexander Bozhkov, the former head of
Bulgaria's privatisation agency who now runs a private consultancy firm
specialising in assisting foreign investors.
Perhaps the most pernicious result of the widespread suspicion in which the
new business class is held is the confirmation of many of the old communist
propaganda images of rapacious capitalists grinding the faces of the poor
and the 'zero sum' notion that wealth is a stock rather than a flow so that
one man's wealth is always at the expense of another.
Rising awareness of the dangers to future economic and social development of
such widespread antipathy has spurred the more intelligent and genuinely
entrepreneurial, rather than parasitic, members of the 'new class' to try
and change both the image and the reality of private business ethics and
methods.
This became clear last month when a split developed within the ranks of the
G - 13, a group of 13 leading private business groups, which has now been
reduced to a rump G - 9.
Lyubomir Gibinsky, the prime mover behind Prime Investment Trust, a holding
which controls 40 companies and is a major shareholder in TSBank one of the
largest and fastest growing private banks, led the breakaway.
'TSBank was a founder members of G - 13 whose idea was to consolidate and
strengthen national capital so that we could have a dialogue and proper
partnership with foreign partners. But in practice some of the members
interpreted this as a way of dividing up the market and to express their
dislike of foreign investors,' says Mr Gibinsky.
They also had a tendency to use 'non-market methods' he added, a euphemism
to explain the rash of car bombs, shoot-outs and beatings which have
punctuated Sofia street life in recent months. 'We decided to leave G - 13
as our principles are free enterprise and fair competition, a North American
not Latin American style of business,' he said.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (1): Light at the end of the tunnel -
Although Bulgaria is going through a painful period of transition, it has
managed to renegotiate its foreign debt and remains a force for stability in
a turbulent region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
After five painful and confusing years of political and economic
re-adjustment, Bulgaria is heading for general elections which are likely to
bring back into power politicians with their roots in the communist past.
If so, this Balkan country of 8.5m people will be following a trend well
established elsewhere in central Europe. In recent elections in countries
such as Poland and Hungary, the political experience and party organisation
of former communists have combined to defeat the inexperienced 'democrats'
who inherited the vacuum of power and bankrupt economies left by the
collapse of Soviet hegemony over the region.
In some respects Bulgaria is ahead of the trend. The anti-communist Union of
Democratic Forces (UDF) which helped oust the communist regime and won the
1991 elections, collapsed 11 months later after losing an unnecessary
no-confidence vote.
The government which replaced it in December 1992, a non-party 'government
of technocrats' headed by Lyuben Berov, a former university professor, was
supported in parliament by the votes of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP),
successor to the defunct communist party led for several decades by Todor
Zhivkov.
Many Bulgarians interpreted this as allowing the BSP to regain power behind
the scenes, ensuring that institutional, economic and other reforms were
either delayed or implemented in a way which benefited the communist era
managers and power brokers who retained jobs throughout the state and local
administration and largely controlled the economy.
Given the totalitarian nature of former party-state regimes throughout the
region, such a development is unsurprising. The old system specialised in
co-opting talent into its various sectors, leaving non-party people in
subordinate or purely technical positions.
Centuries of Turkish suzerainty and economic backwardness in the Balkan
region retarded the development of a substantial middle class and modern
institutions. This facilitated the subsequent re-imposition of feudal-type
communist power relations under Soviet influence after the second world war.
Seen from this historical perspective, Bulgaria has performed somewhat
better than any of its Balkan neighbours since the collapse of the Soviet
system.
In Yugoslavia, former Titoist communists turned themselves into rabid
nationalists and violently tore the country apart. In Romania, Ion Iliescu,
a senior communist party official sidelined by the dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu almost 20 years earlier, seized power after the palace coup of
December 1989 and was able to legitimise his grip at subsequent elections.
What is more, in contrast to Greece's nationalist claims in Albania and its
mounting of a wounding trade embargo on the former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia, Bulgaria has preached moderation and practised
good-neighbourliness under its pro-western president, Zhelyu Zhelev, a
former professor and UDF leader. As a result, Bulgaria has remained an
island of good sense and stability in an otherwise turbulent region.
Domestically, the much-maligned Berov government also provided the necessary
stability and continuity to conclude debt reduction negotiations with both
the Paris Club of official lenders and the London Club of commercial bank
creditors.
Before resigning at the beginning of September this year the government also
concluded a smaller debt swap and repayment deal with Russia, together with
a new trade and investment agreement.
Under this agreement Bulgaria will become one of the main transit routes for
future exports of oil and gas from the Caspian region to the Mediterranean
and southern European markets.
The prospects for an increased flow of trade and investment between Bulgaria
and Russia and other former Soviet states - especially Ukraine and the
central Asian states - are linked to the expected economic revival of former
Comecon markets which five years ago accounted for more than 80 per cent of
Bulgaria's trade.
Now the proportion is between 35 and 40 per cent with more than half of
Bulgaria's trade taking place with OECD countries. The aim is to continue
developing trade in both directions in order to avoid the over-dependence
seen in the past on the former Soviet market.
The combination of economic recovery in the German and other European Union
markets and the prospect of growing trade on a new market-oriented basis
with the middle east and former Comecon states is laying the basis for an
export-led economic recovery after five hard years of declining production
and real incomes.
For this to proceed, however, Bulgaria desperately needs more foreign and
domestic investment with which to modernise its obsolete industries, improve
the energy, transport and telecommunications infrastructure and complete the
present structural shift towards a more modern service, food processing and
light industry based economy.
In the short run, the recent sharp devaluation of the Lev, the Bulgarian
currency, has improved the price competitiveness of Bulgarian goods and
services, albeit at the cost of increasing inflationary pressures and
further depressing real incomes.
Growth prospects have been aided by a sharp recovery in tourism, increasing
transit traffic from Macedonia, higher foreign investment, and the first
signs of recovery in the disorganised agricultural sector.
Overall, the economy is expected to show no growth or possibly a marginal
rise in gross domestic product this year after five years of steep decline.
While encouraging for the future, the first signs of economic recovery are
unlikely to provide much of a 'feel good factor' for most Bulgarian voters.
Too often a free press and open political debate has led to a popular
perception of pervasive corruption, criminality and political incompetence.
The promised mass privatisation programme remains mired in technical detail
while the unemployment, loss of social security and high inflation affecting
many Bulgarians contrast with the high-spending lifestyles of the new rich.
A growing number of private business people are working hard to build up
legitimate companies, living modestly and re-investing profits.
However, with the Serbian border just 50km from Sofia, the capital's
refurbished shopping streets, new restaurants and casinos have become filled
with large men whose swaggering walk and ostentatious wealth is assumed to
come rather from smuggling, drug trafficking or money laundering than from
honest toil and respectable entrepreneurial activity.
All this has brought the politics of envy back to Bulgaria, reflected in the
rising popularity of the BSP with its implied promise of a partial return to
the security of the old regime under a new generation of leaders more
comfortable with market notions of economics and bourgeois concepts of
legality.
Opinion polls also reflect disillusionment with the factional rivalries
within the UDF which is heading for elections under the same leadership that
failed to retain power in 1992 and has lost many of its more competent and
moderate leaders since.
The men to watch are the Socialist Party's young generation of politicians
such as Zhan Videnov, the party's 36-year-old leader, and especially those
from the BSP's social democratic wing such as George Pirinsky, who are
seeking to realign Bulgarian politics and create a moderate, left of centre
grouping in the future parliament.
Above all, the need is to strengthen the rule of law and provide a level
playing ground for the development of legitimate, tax-paying private
business and to encourage the development of a responsible middle class to
underpin democracy.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (2): Ports are evidence of recovery -
Prospects for growth are improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'If Bulgaria had a serious government committed to rapid privatisation the
economy would be in a much better state,' is the standard reply to enquiries
about the state of the Bulgarian economy.
It is true up to a point. A weak government backed by former communists has
been slow in embarking upon a transparent process of privatising, downsizing
or actually closing the biggest loss-makers among the several hundred large
enterprises which formed the backbone of the former centralised economy.
But although precious time has been lost it would be a mistake to conclude
that the Bulgarian economy has become a hopeless case.
The high rate of clandestine asset disposals through 'hidden privatisation',
a 17 per cent unemployment rate, the steady rise in the number of
self-employed workers and new private companies and a successful shift to
new export markets in the west indicate that significant structural changes
are taking place.
After four years of declining output and incomes, the economy has bottomed
out and gross domestic product is expected to show no growth in 1994 and a
modest increase in output and incomes next year, aided by rising demand from
both Germany and the former Soviet market.
The physical evidence for such a recovery can be seen on the bustling quays
of Bulgaria's biggest Black Sea ports, Burgas and Varna. Forklift trucks
load pallets of lead and zinc, bales of chemicals and rolls of coiled steel
on to ships destined for middle eastern and western markets. Big investments
are planned to increase container handling and refrigerated warehouse
facilities and raise volumes of oil and gas.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria's large merchant shipping fleet of more than 2m dwt,
which five years ago mainly served Bulgarian trade, is now 80 per cent hired
out to foreign shippers, earning much needed hard currency for eventual
fleet replacement. Varna and other Black Sea shipyards also report receiving
more orders for new ships than they can handle without heavy new investment
and better management methods.
Refineries and petrochemical plants, such as Neftochim on the outskirts of
Burgas which has been working at half capacity for much of the past three
years, also report sharply higher export and domestic demand, and higher
profits. At Neftochim, the country's largest refinery and petrochemical
complex, a Lv12m loss in 1992 was converted into a profit of more than Lv1bn
in the first eight months of this year on sales of Lv25bn, compared with
sales of Lv12.4bn in the whole of 1992, although inflation distorts the
figures.
On the negative side, cumulative inflation over the first eight months of
the year reached 65 per cent, about the level for the whole of 1993 and
double the projected level agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The
combination of sharp Lev devaluation in March and August/September and the
resulting push to inflation has cut average wages in dollar terms to about
Dollars 75 per month, forcing many workers to take second jobs in the
private sector to escape poverty.
The private sector now accounts for between 25 and 30 per cent of economic
activity, although 90 per cent of industry is still formally in state hands
and privatisation remains slow. Significantly, rapid growth in the private
sector, especially in tourism, retailing, financial and other services, is
being matched by a patchy but noticeable recovery in parts of the state
sector, such as steel, metals processing, shipbuilding, shipping and
chemicals which have been hard pressed to survive since the collapse of
Comecon markets.
The prospects for growth have been greatly improved by the successful
conclusion of negotiations with Paris Club official creditors and the far
more important London Club agreement at the end of June which reduced
Bulgaria's Dollars 8.16bn debt to a group of more than 300 western
commercial banks by about 47 per cent.
The IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions have
pledged nearly Dollars 1bn to help finance the Dollars 716m up-front costs
of the debt reduction and rescheduling agreements which will cost Bulgaria
an estimated Dollars 300m a year.
Thus far the London Club agreement, which re-opens Bulgaria's access to
normal commercial bank lending, has not led to the sharp rise in foreign
investment and foreign bank interest which followed the earlier conclusion
of Poland's similar debt reduction accord.
But foreign equity investment has risen from just over Dollars 100m to more
than Dollars 500m during the past two years and several small- to
medium-sized investments are pending in the brewery, hotel and tourism, food
processing and other sectors as the privatisation agency grinds through its
paces.
Heavy infrastructure investment in telecommunications, roads, bridges,
ports, pipelines and railway is also on the horizon as European and
international lending agencies gear up to raise Bulgaria's profile as a key
link in western Europe's expected fast-improving trade with the energy rich
former Soviet states of central Asia and the middle east.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Rifkind says fighting jobs
safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cuts in the fighting strength of the armed forces are over, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, promised the conference yesterday.
The pledge, which signals that the Ministry of Defence will escape big cuts
in this year's public expenditure round, was cheered by delighted
constituency representatives.
Praising the performance of British troops in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and
Kuwait, Mr Rifkind said that future demands on the armed forces were
uncertain.
But he told the conference: 'I can give you this undertaking. Even if our
commitments were to reduce, there will be no contraction in the fighting
strength of our army.
'There will be no further cuts in battalions, no more amalgamations of
regular regiments.' Any reduction in commitments would 'not be a
justification for cuts in the armed services'. Rather, it would 'be good
news for them,' he said.
'It would mean more time for training, more opportunity for service abroad
and more time with their families. That is what the armed forces want to
hear.'
Later, Mr Rifkind said he was 'absolutely certain' that the Treasury would
not seek further cuts in the armed forces following the completion of the
Options for Change programme of efficiency savings. In a round of
interviews, Mr Rifkind said that his pledge not to cut the fighting strength
of the forces would last 'as long as this government is in office'.
Speaking on BBC television, he said: 'The Treasury has accepted that the
armed forces have more than made their (contribution) to the needs of the
taxpayer.
'While we will always be expected to find ways of being more efficient and
concerned with value for money . . . there will be no proposals put to me by
my colleagues for any cuts in the fighting strength of our armed forces.'
Mr Rifkind's pledge followed attacks on defence cost cutting by several
constituency representatives. Mr Bob Martin, a retired air commodore from
Oxford, was applauded as he criticised the 'Whitehall warriors' cutting the
forces. 'In the past year or two there have been more axes and knives
hacking away at our services by these new-style Whitehall warriors than the
forces have ever experienced.'

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Dorrell spells out lottery
prospects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The number of outlets selling tickets for the National Lottery, which go on
sale from November 14, would rise to 40,000 from a start of 10,000, and its
turnover was expected to equal that of the confectionery industry, Mr
Stephen Dorrell, national heritage secretary, told conference.
He envisaged that the lottery would provide Pounds 9bn over seven years to
boost expenditure on the arts, national monuments and other projects.
Mr Dorrell said this demonstrated the government's commitment to developing
cultural and artistic life.
He condemned the 'offensive suggestion' by Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow heritage
secretary, that Buckingham Palace should be sold off, and the royal family
removed to a designer palace.
Mr Dorrell said this would involve divorcing the royal family from its
roots, and would amount to a form of 'cultural vandalism'.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Scots parliament plan
dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dismissed Labour's plans to
set up a Scottish parliament as a recipe for the break-up of the UK.
Underlining the government's commitment to a wholehearted defence of the
union, Mr Lang told a conference fringe meeting that only Scottish
nationalists would benefit from home rule.
Scottish independence would follow devolution 'as night follows day' as
nationalists circled 'like vultures' around the constitutional wreckage
created by Labour, he said.
In a speech underlining the approach adopted by the government after the
last general election, Mr Lang promised full recognition of Scotland's
status.
'We have taken more concrete steps in recognition of Scotland's status as a
nation than any government since 1707,' he said.
Mr Lang said that Labour's devolution proposals 'rank as one of the most
irresponsible positions ever adopted by a party seeking to be elected'.
He said the plan would cost Scotland its voice in the cabinet, cut the
number of Scottish MPs and lead to a smaller share of resources for
Scotland.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: High-risk Ulster vote may
be allowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory leadership will decide today whether to allow a vote on an
amendment urging the government to be 'a persuader for the union' at the end
of this afternoon's conference debate on Northern Ireland, David Owen
writes.
The amendment has been promoted heavily by the party's grassroots members in
Northern Ireland. They have voiced concern at what they term the
government's 'neutrality' on the issue of Ulster's future status.
A decision to allow a vote would be a high-risk strategy as adoption of the
amendment could strain relations between London and Dublin.
The motion salutes the 'courage' shown by both Mr John Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, in agreeing the Downing Street
declaration, and urges ministers to leave no stone unturned in pursuing
peace 'consistent with the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to
determine by democratic means their future'.
In Bournemouth yesterday, Mr David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper
Bann, backed Mr Major's caution in responding to the IRA's open-ended
ceasefire.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Prospect of housing
benefit cut recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Lilley is playing down speculation that his department will
introduce big cuts in housing benefit this year.
The social security secretary has told colleagues that his officials at the
Department of Social Security can make only 'cosmetic' changes to the
housing benefit programme, because they are occupied with too many
cost-cutting projects in next year's legislative timetable.
Treasury officials have put intense pressure on the DSS in recent months to
reduce its Pounds 9bn annual expenditure on housing benefit, arguing that
the programme is growing much faster than the nation's ability to pay for
it.
Earlier this year Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, said
he wanted to target housing benefit costs in this year's Budget, arguing
that 'quite a lot' of recipients were 'living in houses that are too big for
them'. He said: 'There are areas such as the exponential growth in housing
benefit where you have to look very carefully to make sure taxpayers' money
is not being wasted.'
However - as this year's public spending round draws to a close - officials
at the DSS have privately remarked that Mr Aitken was not properly briefed
when he made these remarks, and that the DSS cannot carry out a sweeping
reform of the programme this year.
They argue that large-scale changes to the programme would require primary
legislation and that the DSS is already committed to pushing through two
substantial bills next year on the reform of occupational pensions and the
Jobseeker's Allowance.
Mr Lilley confirmed yesterday that he would introduce a 'Back To Work' bonus
next year, making it worthwhile for unemployed people to take part-time work
as a prelude to starting a full-time job.
Under the proposals, which will benefit 150,000 people, those who lose
benefit when they start a part-time job will build up a DSS 'credit'. This
can be converted into a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000 when they undertake a
full-time job.
Mr Lilley told journalists that the government would shortly be introducing
a white paper on the Jobseeker's Allowance, outlining details of a new
agreement. This may tighten up the rules under which benefit recipients are
obliged to look for a job.

In his speech to the conference, Mr Lilley said the government would make
all payments in kind assessable for National Insurance contributions by the
employer.
'I am fed up with spivvy schemes to avoid National Insurance contributions
by paying yuppies their bonuses in gold bars, diamonds or vintage wines,' he
told the conference. 'I'll put an end to them once and for all.'
In recent years, the Department of Social Security has gradually clamped
down on the payment of City bonuses in the form of goods.
Three months ago, Mr Lilley announced that gemstones and a range of
alcoholic drinks would be treated as payments of earnings.
However, amid signs that Labour is committed to closing a number of tax
loopholes enjoyed by high salary earners, Mr Lilley told the Tory conference
he was extending the scheme.
The government will make most goods in kind assessable, specifying those few
which are outside the tax net. Mr Lilley said, for example, that luncheon
vouchers would be regarded as a form of payment outside the National
Insurance net.
In the last Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, claimed to have saved
about Pounds 70m a year by preventing gold bars and other tradeable
commodities being used to avoid contributions.
One of the main reasons why companies have exploited the loophole is that
while there is an upper salary limit (now Pounds 430 a week) above which no
further employee contributions are due, there is no limit for employers.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: NHS fraudsters face
clampdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Family doctors and pharma-cists are to be asked to spearhead a drive to stop
the National Health Service being robbed of millions of pounds through
prescription charge fraud, Mrs Virginia Bottomley said yesterday.
While no precise figures for the fraud were available, the health secretary
suggested that 'tens of millions' of pounds might be involved.
Mr Gerald Malone, the health minister, is to have urgent talks with doctors
and pharmacists about tightening procedures on prescribing and dispensing
medicines.
This could involve doctors providing written confirmation of patients
entitled to exemption from charges, and patients having to produce proof of
identity to pharmacists.
Mrs Bottomley, who was not subjected to any criticism by constituency
representatives in a debate dominated by praise for the NHS, received an
unenthusiastic standing ovation.
She said prescription exemption arrangements for pensioners, expectant
mothers and those suffering from persistent illness as being among the most
generous in the world.
Defending the self-governing hospital trusts and other reforms introduced in
April 1991, Mrs Bottomley said 3,000 extra patients were being treated every
day.
She confirmed that more GPs would be given the chance to control their
budgets through an extension of the voluntary GP fundholders' scheme. All
practices with 3,000 or more patients will be able to join an 'easy entry'
community fundholding scheme to cover drugs, staff, and diagnostic tests.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Heseltine pushes for
postal sell-off - Chief whip to have final say on privatisation go-ahead /
Backbench critics softening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday sought to
steady government nerves on the proposed Royal Mail flotation in a
barnstorming conference speech extolling the benefits of privatisation.
Amid cabinet uncertainty about the government's ability to push
privatisation through the Commons, Mr Heseltine warned against caution and
urged the party to 'force the pace of change'.
Senior ministers say the cabinet will decide shortly whether to include a
Post Office privatisation bill in the Queen's Speech for the next
parliament, which starts in mid-November.
There is a small cabinet majority for Mr Heseltine's plan to float 51 per
cent of the Royal Mail, following the conversion of Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, who was sceptical but now believes privatisation is the
best option.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has supported Mr Heseltine, as have
rightwing cabinet ministers such as Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary,
who yesterday strongly defended privatisation at a conference fringe
meeting.
However, the final decision will depend on a judgment by Mr Richard Ryder,
the chief whip, and Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, on the number of
Conservative backbench MPs who may defy the government and oppose the bill.
Mr Ryder is believed to be confident that the bill can be forced through, in
spite of the death yesterday of Mr John Blackburn, MP for Dudley West, which
reduces the government's majority to 14.
But senior ministers say no decisions will be made until further soundings
have been taken when MPs return to the Commons for the autumn 'spillover'
session next week. 'At the moment, the numbers don't look very good,' said
one.
There is some evidence of softening opposition among critics of
privatisation, following government assurances on universal delivery prices
and the future of rural post offices.
Mr David Nicholson, chairman of the West Country group of Conservative MPs,
many of whom remain unconvinced about the merits of privatisation, signalled
that some backbench critics were ready to be won over.
'If Mr Heseltine is to proceed with a partial privatisation and to get
second-reading support, the government will have to continue to explain, in
detail, why it is important for the industry,' he said.
Mr Heseltine, making his first conference speech since suffering a heart
attack last year, won a two-minute standing ovation for a wideranging speech
which demonstrated his continuing mastery of conference oratory.
Lauding the government's earlier privatisation achievements, he dismissed
'those who tell me that the best way for the Tories to win the next election
is to slow the pace, to ease the pressure, to opt for the quiet life'.
As representatives cheered, he told them: 'What the government is
considering and consulting about is how to allow the Royal Mail to be as
successful as British Telecom or British Airways.'
Mr Alan Johnson, general secretary of the UCW communications union, said in
Bournemouth that Mr Hesel-tine's failure to announce the go-ahead for
privatisation 'illustrates how deep-seated government fears are over the
future of our trusted and cherished Post Office'.
He said most Conservative party members 'seem aware that privatising and
breaking up the Post Office would not only be damaging and unnecessary but
also deeply unpopular'.

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: New conference darling
steps up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo yesterday set out a 'distinctive' Conservative agenda
for the 1996 European Union intergovernmental conference, as he threatened
to usurp the unofficial title of 'conference darling' from Mr Michael
Heseltine.
The rightwing employment secretary used a speech to the Thatcherite
Conservative Way Forward group on the conference fringe to set out the
'clear blue water' he saw between the Tories and Mr Tony Blair's new-look
Labour party. He made it clear that the adoption of more rightwing policies
was not the key to distinguishing the party from Labour.
'If Labour were to adopt every Conservative policy, if Labour were to
publish our manifesto word for word . . . there would still be a yawning
gulf between the two parties,' he said. 'A gulf of belief and principle: the
gulf between the rock of our philosophy and the quicksand of Labour's
posturing.'
In an impressive and well-judged display in a series of interviews and
speeches yesterday, Mr Portillo did not make any semblance of an overtly
disloyal remark. But those witnessing his performance could scarcely have
been in doubt about the underlying message: the young pretender was still
around and had reinforced his credentials as a likely rightwing challenger
in any future leadership contest.
The pains he took to appear restrained and statesmanlike were helped by
Monday's startling speech by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. By
comparison, Mr Portillo's message - even his forthright call in the
conference hall to 'stop the rot from Brussels' - seemed positively
mainstream.
Even so, he was careful not to provide ammunition for anyone anxious to
portray him as having stepped out of line.
He said he was pleased by the rapturous reception, complete with four-minute
standing ovation, that his conference speech received because 'the things
that got the biggest cheer . . . were the things that John Major had won for
the Conservative party'. And asked about the difference in tone between his
speech, with its stinging attack on Brussels bureaucracy, and that by Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, he said: 'Mr Hurd is in a different league
from me.'
Mr Portillo proposed a three-pronged agenda around which he said the
Conservative party could unite in the run-up to the 1996 intergovernmental
conference. This comprised: making sure most decisions affecting people's
daily lives were taken by national governments; encouraging the European
Union to be 'outward looking' in its approach to trade and new members; and
resisting moves to impose new costs on business that would impair the
competitiveness of European companies.
In a wide-ranging and combative speech, he was restrained enough to sidestep
a question on whether he would rescind the Maastricht treaty and said Mr
Major was right to delay a decision on joining a single currency.
Mr Portillo's performance came as Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, warned
Mr Blair that he would play into Tory hands if he chose to 'fight on our
ground'. In a vigorous defence on the conference fringe of free enterprise
and individual action, Mr Howard said there was still 'a philosophical gulf'
between the two main parties.
'The values and vision of the Conservative party are as powerful and
resonant as they were in 1979,' he said. 'We believe free markets and strong
communities complement each other.'

FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth (Political Notebook):
Conference focuses on a view of Europe from Planet Portillo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday the Tory conference took a day trip from Bournemouth to Planet
Portillo. It had a wonderful time. Europe isn't working, the young
employment secretary declared. No, he wasn't just referring to the dole
queues. Stop the rot from Brussels, he shouted, as the hall achieved
lift-off. Huge cheers. In that strange European world, he warned the excited
representatives, people thought carrots were fruit and bananas should be
straight. Britain would have no part of it. Ecstatic ovation.
It was a skilful performance. Mr Portillo has long been judged by the Tory
right at Westminster as the natural heir to Lady Thatcher. Now he is
beginning to build the constituency he needs among the party activists.
Waving the Union flag among the retired colonels and the young militants who
have come to dominate these annual gatherings is the surest way to win their
hearts. They crave certainty. Mr Portillo gave them it. He was rewarded with
an ovation lasting four minutes. Mr Michael Heseltine, for a generation the
unchallenged master of conference showmanship, managed only two.
Mr Portillo was careful not to overstep the bounds of collective cabinet
responsibility. In his tirade against the social chapter he evoked Mr John
Major's 'act of statesmanship' in negotiating Britain's opt-out. He
disassociated himself from Mr Norman Lamont's apocalyptic warning that
Britain may be forced to withdraw from Europe to preserve its nationhood.
To have done otherwise would have invited dismissal from the cabinet. But Mr
Portillo's tone was enough to stake out his ground. He does not favour
withdrawal now from the European Union. But he thinks the government should
not go an inch further along the path of integration - whatever the
consequences. He would probably agree with the colleague who described Mr
Lamont's intervention as follows: right message, wrong messenger, wrong
time.
It seems scarcely credible that it was only four years ago - in this same
conference hall - that Mr Heseltine prepared for the challenge that would
destroy Lady Thatcher; or that his most potent weapon then was her
anti-Europeanism. Yesterday Mr Heseltine stuck to his principles and warned
that disengagement from Europe would be an abject surrender of Britain's
national interest. The representatives did not enjoy the return to the
earth. They sat on their hands.
Mr Major must have looked on in despair. The minefield of the 1996
intergovernmental conference on the next stage of European integration lies
between his government and the general election due by 1997. Alongside Mr
Portillo stand Mr Peter Lilley, Mr John Redwood, Mr Michael Howard and
perhaps a dozen junior ministers. Behind Mr Portillo stand up to 100 Tory
MPs.
The pro-European wing is stronger. Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Douglas Hurd do
not share Mr Heseltine's instinctive view that Britain should participate in
all projects European. But they and the majority around the cabinet table
are equally clear that there is no future in opting out.
Mr Hurd - busy crafting a British agenda for 1996 which has a chance of
holding the Tories together without being laughed at in Paris and Bonn - is
reviewing his original intention to quit the Foreign Office next year. He
has just turned down the post of Nato secretary-general in spite of pressure
from the Alliance's four biggest members. He has not discussed his future
with the prime minister since then. But friends have the impression that if
Mr Major asked him to stay, then Mr Hurd might well agree.
Like most others in the cabinet, Mr Hurd sees no possibility in the
short-term of Britain joining a single currency. It would break the party.
The electorate would not have it. But the foreign secretary is certain that
Britain must be in the vanguard of efforts to build a common European
security policy. Once an admirer of Mr Portillo's sharp intellect, Mr Hurd
is now dismissive of the notion that it would be possible now to abandon the
political dimension of Europe. In his mind the 'variable geometry' approach
to the next stage of European integration would allow Britain to opt out, if
necessary, from Emu while remaining on the inside track on defence and
foreign policy.
Mr Major's position is more complicated. In spite of the sceptical edge to
his recent pronouncements on the future of Europe he has not joined the
ranks of the antis. He is irritated by the grand strategies of Mr Jacques
Delors and other European visionaries. He finds them patronising.
But he regards Mr Portillo's view of the world as self-serving and lacking
an understanding of history. He is searching for a formula which will allow
him to take the bulk of the Tory party - and of the much wider electorate -
with him. If he succeeds he will be assured a place in history as the prime
minister who saved the Conservative party.
It is far from certain he will succeed. Beyond the German elections this
weekend and the French presidential race next summer it is easy to see
another Franco-German drive towards European unity. The Conservative party
is being held together only by the fact that it wants to remain in
government. But seen from Planet Portillo, any further transfer of
sovereignty to Brussels would be too high a price for victory at the general
election.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Tesco poised for deal on Virgin Cola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tesco is expected to announce today that it will have the exclusive rights
to sell Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola for at least six months.
The unexpected deal puts the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain head to
head with J. Sainsbury, the biggest chain, in the Cola wars.
In April Sainsbury became the first group to pose a serious challenge to
Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, when it launched its Classic Cola brand.
The deal with Tesco solves Virgin's main challenge in developing the new
brand, announced by Virgin on Monday: how to achieve nationwide
distribution.
Mr Branson felt he needed a 7 per cent share of the UK retail market to make
a success of the product and is understood to believe that the deal with
Tesco will give him that 'at a stroke'. Virgin Cola will be available in
Tesco's stores before the end of November.
Virgin is expecting a very aggressive counter-offensive from Coca-Cola, and
is planning to sign exclusive deals with an off-licence chain and a
newsagent chain to secure access to every sector of the retail market.
Both Tesco and Sainsbury are obtaining their cola syrup from the same
source, Cott Corporation of Canada. Virgin has formed a 50-50 joint venture
company with Cott to market its new product.
The deal with Tesco is surprising after comments made by Mr Simon Lester,
Cott's managing director, when Virgin Cola was launched. He said that the
drink would be sold largely through independent retailers.
Mr Mike Conolly, director for soft drinks at Sainsbury, said last night that
his company had an exclusive deal with Cott for its recipe, developed in
conjunction with Sainsbury's own buyers. However, Cott was free to enter
into ventures with other retailers involving different formulations.
'It is hardly surprising that others should want to copy our success,' he
said.
He added that Sainsbury's Classic had had all summer to build customer
loyalty, and had developed a 'healthy market share and a very loyal
following'.
Meanwhile, the Tesco deal could further dent Coca-Cola's market share in the
UK. Within three weeks of Classic's launch in April, the Sainsbury brand had
captured about 15 per cent by value of all Cola sales through any UK retail
outlet. That compared with the 3 per cent market share held by Sainsbury's
own label product previously.
Coca-Cola was incensed by the launch of Classic, because it felt that the
packaging design was too close to its own. Sainsbury has since subtly
altered the packaging.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Old ideas on jobless benefit given new suit of clothes:
David Goodhart on cynicism over an allowance unveiled to the Tory faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Jobseeker's Allowance, the new benefit which will combine Unemployment
Benefit and Income Support, was yesterday being paraded around the
Conservative party conference. But in the Jobcentres there is confusion
about what it will mean, and a certain cynicism about how much of the
proposal is new.
Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, both stressed yesterday that the allowance was part of a
tough new contract between the unemployed person and the state.
Mr Portillo told the Tory faithful: 'We shall ask those seeking a job to
make a bargain with the taxpayer: to commit themselves to follow a solid
programme of action directed towards getting work. They must agree to apply
for jobs, go to interviews, attend courses, (and) get re-trained.'
This emphasis on the contract and on the fact that an unemployed person can
turn down a job offer or a training place only if he or she has very good
reason is the closest Britain gets to the idea of working for benefit, or
workfare.
But Mrs Margaret Walker, manager of 12 Jobcentres in south-east London,
points out that her officials can already, after 13 weeks, take away benefit
from people who are turning down jobs or making insufficient effort to find
work.
Taking away benefits happens relatively seldom. Mrs Walker said that only
nine people in her area - which includes some of the highest levels of
unemployment in Britain - had been refused benefit for turning down a job
offer this year out of 53,000 unemployed.
The number is small not because staff are 'soft' - the figures are similar
all over the country - but because of the relatively long procedures and the
fact that few claimants will allow the process to get to the final stage.
The idea of the contract between claimant and the state is a development of
an existing idea. Mr Robin Smith of Greenwich Jobcentre in south-east London
said: 'We already have back-to-work plans that a claimant must sign, so we
are a bit puzzled about what all the fuss is about.'
These back-to-work plans are tailored by staff to each individual claimant.
They may, for example, require a claimant to visit a Jobcentre twice a week
and to make a certain number of job inquiries.
The cynicism of Jobcentre staff towards the more political aspects of the
allowance does not mean they are opposed to it. Mrs Walker said: 'It has
been causing some anxiety because so few details have been released so far.'
That should end next month when a white paper is published, with a view to
the new benefit starting in April 1996.
Anything that brings the Benefits Agency closer to the Jobcentres - part of
the Employment Service - is welcomed. Jobcentres are now responsible for
Unemployment Benefit, which is about Pounds 44 per week.
Jobcentres also act as agents for the Benefits Agency in paying the most
important benefit, Income Support. This is complex and governed by different
rules to Unemployment Benefit, and claimants often have difficulties that
Jobcentre staff cannot solve. The new allowance will mean more Benefits
Agency staff in Jobcentres.
Merging the benefits will be a relief to most claimants and staff. But it is
a long-overdue technical reform, which cannot stand the weight of political
rhetoric being placed upon it.

FT  13 OCT 94 / NHS hospitals 'selling land to fund repairs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than a third of National Health Service trust hospitals expect to sell
land or other assets to fund developments and repair programmes worth Pounds
1.27bn over the next two years, a survey published today shows.
The findings underline the importance being attached by developers and
construction companies to the government's private-sector finance
initiative, which expects a growing proportion of the country's
infrastructure to be funded from private sources.
The recent revival in residential and commercial property values has led to
an increase in land sales and deals being offered by hospitals seeking funds
to improve health facilities.
The study of the construction and property requirements of 178 trust
hospitals by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors shows that 34 per
cent expect to use asset sales as their main source of funds for future
developments.
Another 23 per cent expect to use finance raised from banks, leasing
arrangements or some other private-sector source to support investments.
Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital Trust recently announced plans
to give away land and buildings on its prestigious Chelsea site to private
bidders willing to develop and run hospital services. The successful bidder
will be given the opportunity to redevelop a redundant clinical building and
nurses' home. Construction groups submitting bids include George Wimpey,
Tarmac and Sir Robert McAlpine.
Barratt, Britain's third-largest housebuilder, and Watford-based Country
Metropolitan Homes have announced a joint Pounds 100m development plan at
Highlands Hospital at Enfield, north London, which is transferring to the
nearby Chase Farm hospital.
Mr Christopher Vickers, construction spokesman for the institution, said:
'Growing pressure on trusts to self-finance building and maintenance works
means that they are having to develop new funding methods. Our research
shows that this is increasingly likely to be obtained through internally
generated sources, such as sale of assets, rather than borrowing from banks
or cost-cutting exercises.'
Some 86 per cent of trust hospitals expect to carry out some form of new
building work over the next two years with nearly two-thirds of trusts
planning to spend more than Pounds 500,000, emphasising 'the pent up demand
for repair and maintenance work in the health sector'.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Estate agents pay price of boom years: The background to
Nationwide's sale of branches at three a penny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few ventures illustrate more starkly the excesses of the late 1980s than the
ill-fated purchases of estate agencies by banks, building societies and
insurance companies.
Nationwide, Britain's second biggest building society, announced on Tuesday
it was selling for just Pounds 1 a total of 304 estate agency branches
acquired since 1987 for Pounds 120m. Nationwide had made cumulative losses
of Pounds 80m at the branches taking the society's total loss to Pounds
200m.
Abbey National bank and Prudential Corporation made combined losses
totalling more than Pounds 500m when they sold their estate agency
businesses in 1993 and 1991.
A quarter of UK estate agency branches are estimated to have closed since
1988.
Yet the logic of wedding the financial services revolution to the housing
boom seemed faultless in the late 1980s when estate agencies were among the
busiest businesses in the high street; house sales were running at more than
2m a year and house prices were rising sharply.
People who bought houses also needed mortgages and insurance, argued
building societies and banks. What better way to market the growing range of
financial services than to sell them all from the same shop? There was also
a fear that if they did not buy estate agencies, other financial
institutions would, cutting them off from potential mortgage sales outlets.
The rush to buy agencies prompted a feeding frenzy. The price of businesses
soared as institutions measured success by how many branches they had.
Nationwide paid an average of almost Pounds 400,000 for each of the 300
outlets it is now selling at three a penny.
In 1988 there were estimated to be 16,000 estate agency branches owned by
about 11,000 companies. This is estimated to have fallen to about 12,000
offices owned by about 6,500 companies. Half of all housing transactions are
handled by about 25 national concerns mostly owned by financial
institutions.
None of these appear to have anticipated the severity of the housing
recession which saw house sales in England and Wales fall from a peak of
2.1m in 1988 to 1.1m in 1992 and which are only expected to reach 1.2m this
year.
UK house prices have declined on average by 10 per cent since the third
quarter of 1989 according to Halifax, Britain's biggest building society and
owner of 530 estate agency branches.
The fall has been disastrous for agents who are paid only on completed sales
and earn fees from commission based on a small percentage of the sale price.
Incomes became insufficient to pay rents and rates on expensive high street
properties and to meet salaries.
In a bid to curtail costs, smaller agencies reduced mailing shots and in
some cases started to bill sellers for advertising. Some refused to market
properties they felt were unrealistically priced. Heavy pressure was put on
sellers to reduce asking prices in a bid to make sales.
Mr Harry Hill, managing director of Hambro Countrywide, which is acquiring
the Nationwide chain, said his company had been successful because it had
concentrated on selling houses rather than financial services.
He added: 'In the past there was a temptation by building societies to see a
move into this business as an opportunity for more mortgage lending.
Arguably this has been an expensive mistake.'
Building societies which were generating a large slice of their loan
portfolio from estate agencies may have found it more difficult to cut costs
and close loss-making branches than smaller independents selling a single
product.
Nationwide says it won Pounds 2.5bn - representing 7.2 per cent of its
mortgage business - over the counters of its estate agencies in seven years.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said the disposal would allow
it 'to concentrate more effectively on our core financial services
business.' Hambro will offer Nationwide mortgages under a marketing
agreement.
Halifax, however, intends to retain its 530 estate agency branches which it
says generated a tenth of its mortgage business in the first half of this
year even though the estate agency division itself made a Pounds 2m loss.
'We are strongly committed to the estate agency business which will improve
as house sales increase,' it said.
The housing market, however, remains sluggish. A walk down most high streets
suggests that there still may be too many agents chasing too few sales in an
industry where the cost of entry for the smallest independent may be little
more than the rent on a shop, a car and a good photocopier.

The NUT teaching union yesterday said opposition to national curriculum
tests in England and Wales among its members was easing.
This year the NUT was the only union to boycott the tests, following a ban
on them by all three main teachers' unions last year.
It is canvassing its members after the announcement last month by Mrs
Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, of a Pounds 30m package of
concessions to ease teachers' workload.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Ford to offer free mobile phones
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford will add a new dimension to the fierce battle for new car sales by
offering a free mobile telephone and connection to the Cellnet network with
almost every new car and van sold from October 18, John Griffiths writes.
The company, which is spending Pounds 4m to promote the offer, said it
expects at least 100,000 buyers a year to take up the offer - about one in
five of new Ford vehicle customers.
Mr David Thomas, Ford of Britain's marketing plans manager, acknowledged
yesterday that the UK mobile telephone market was a 'jungle' with offers of
'free' handsets typically offset by very high line rental and call charges.
However, Ford is an airtime provider itself and says that its line rental
and charges are competitive with the rates charged for handsets costing more
than Pounds 175.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Tory MP for Dudley West dies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was yesterday faced with the likely reduction of its Commons
majority to 13 after Mr John Blackburn, the Conservative MP for Dudley West,
died of a heart attack aged 61.
Mr Blackburn's death in the early hours of yesterday morning leaves the
Conservatives facing a by-election in a marginal Midlands constituency at a
time when the party is trailing Labour in the polls.
It reduces the government's majority temporarily to 14, but Labour would be
disappointed not to make further inroads by overturning the majority of
5,789 that Mr Blackburn had in the 1992 general election.
Such a result would make it even harder for the government to push
controversial legislation, such as the planned Post Office privatisation,
through parliament.
Mr Blackburn, a former policeman and one-time sales director of Solway
Engineering, was staunchly loyal to the party line throughout his 15-year
parliamentary career.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Airports face capacity crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heathrow and Gatwick will have to turn passengers away from the beginning of
the next century unless an additional runway is built to serve London's two
busiest airports, according to a study commissioned by the British Air
Transport Association, the UK airline trade organisation.
The report, which has not yet been published, warns that the proposed
construction of a new Pounds 900m terminal at Heathrow and expansion at
Luton and Stansted will not be sufficient to accommodate passenger demand in
the London area after the turn of the century.
The debate over the need for additional runway capacity in the south-east is
dividing the UK aviation industry. BAA, the airports operator, and British
Airways argue that there is no urgent need for a new runway, while other
airlines are pressing for additional runway capacity in the Heathrow-Gatwick
area.
Both BAA and BA are anxious to avoid any controversy over a new runway
undermining the proposed development of Terminal Five at Heathrow, which
will be at the centre of a long and fiercely contested public inquiry
starting in May.
BAA has argued that Heathrow requires additional terminal capacity but will
not need additional runway capacity until about 2015. A fifth terminal at
Heathrow would enable BA to concentrate operations at its main London hub.
The report expresses concern that the campaign for the terminal risks
delaying any government decision on a new runway. It says arguments that the
government need take no decision on a new runway until well into the next
century are 'dangerously misconceived'.
The government is due to make a statement this year on the findings of a
committee it set up to study runway capacity in the south-east.
'Our worst fear is that the government will take no decision and will be
persuaded that the system can cope without any change for the time being,'
said Mr David Hopkins, the trade organisation's chairman and former head of
Britannia Airways.
If the government were to sidestep the runway issue, it would delay any
expansion programme by up to 20 years, he added.
This would give an advantage to rival European airports.
The study says Department of Transport figures show that capacity at
Heathrow was between 96.8 per cent and 98.5 per cent this summer and Gatwick
was between 95.2 per cent and 95.9 per cent.
Capacity is available at Stansted and Luton, but the study emphasises that
airlines are mainly interested in serving Heathrow and Gatwick.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Report fuels homes-for-votes row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pressure on Westminster City Council will intensify today with allegations
in a BBC television documentary that councillors were misled over the
contents of the consultants' report used to justify the council's
controversial housing policy.
Public hearings start next week into the district auditor's provisional
report that Westminster sold council houses between 1987 and 1989 in a
deliberate attempt to bolster the Conservative vote in eight marginal
electoral wards.
In January, Mr John Magill, the district auditor, described this as
'gerrymandering', and ruled provisionally that five councillors - including
Dame Shirley Porter, Westminster's former leader - and four officers should
be surcharged Pounds 21.25m to repay the money wasted on the policy.
However, the BBC documentary, First Sight, claims that the policy was part
of a 'long-term objective' to 'socially engineer the city's population'. It
produces a council document from September 1986 which says: 'The sale of
council properties offers little opportunity to socially engineer the
population of Westminster. This should remain a long-term objective.'
A Conservative councillor, Mr Anthony Prendergast, told the programme that
councillors were misled over the findings of a report which found that
Westminster was losing population. He said: 'I think they decided to
re-interpret some of the conclusions to suit their own means . . . trying to
obtain a population which is more likely to vote Conservative than Labour.'
Yesterday, Mr Peter Bradley, a Labour councillor and one of the objectors to
the policy who first called for the district auditor's investigation, said:
'I just think it's a sad reflection on the state of the Conservative party
that it's taken him this long to speak his mind.'

FT  13 OCT 94 / Chancellor urged not to cut taxes in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be able to cut public spending plans
for the coming 1995-96 financial year by Pounds 5bn without having to make
real inroads into the government's spending programme, the independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies reported yesterday.
In its 'Green Budget', prepared with Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
the independent tax policy research group says the chancellor should stay
firm and not cut taxes in next month's Budget.
The study says the public sector borrowing requirement looked set to
undershoot previous forecasts. For this financial year to the end of March
1995, the institute and Goldman Sachs expect a PSBR of Pounds 32bn compared
with the Pounds 36bn predicted in the Treasury's summer forecast. They
expect a 1995-96 deficit of Pounds 24bn, although it could be as low as
Pounds 21bn, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product, if the government
maintains its existing spending plans in real terms in the run-up to the
next general election.
The report says lower-than-expected inflation means the chancellor can keep
to his previous plans for real, inflation-adjusted public spending while
announcing a nominal Pounds 5bn cut in spending for next year. Without such
a reduction in the existing Pounds 263bn public expenditure control total,
policy would be loosened next year and taxes might have to rise in the
medium term.
The authors say improved public finances should not be used as an excuse to
cut taxes because the drop in the PSBR will be entirely the result of higher
than anticipated economic growth. 'The tax increases announced last year
remain essential to bring the public finances under control,' they add.
The Green Budget, so-called because it is modelled on a government
consultative document, or green paper, suggests that Mr Clarke will choose
neither to tighten nor ease fiscal policy next month. With the next general
election up to two and a half years away, dramatic initiatives are not
expected. But the chancellor could still decide to change individual tax and
spending programmes within the existing framework.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, institute director, suggested that the chancellor may act
to reform family credit and the in-work benefit system to create more
incentives for the low-paid to seek work. An eye-catching but cheap move
would be to boost tax allowances for small companies.
With inflation low, Mr Clarke might be tempted to freeze income tax
allowances, saving some Pounds 750m, and use the proceeds to widen the 20
per cent reduced rate income tax band to Pounds 4,000 from Pounds 3,000. Mr
Dilnot said Mr Clarke might also seek to tidy up the tax treatment of
savings. But the authors do not anticipate any radical change in the tax
treatment of dividends.
The authors expect further increases in interest rates. Mr David Walton,
Goldman's senior international economist, yesterday forecast UK bank base
rates of 7 per cent by mid-1995 compared with 5.75 per cent at present.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Wages 'rising faster than reported'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Real wages are rising much faster than employers or the government are
acknowledging, according to an analysis of the latest pay and inflation
figures by Mr Chris Trinder of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy.
Mr Trinder said yesterday that real wage growth averaged 1.4 per cent in
1993-94 but could be as high as 2.5 per cent in 1994-95.
'When inflation rose from 1.4 per cent in November 1993 to 2.6 per cent in
June 1994, earnings also increased from 3 per cent to 3.75 per cent. Now,
despite inflation falling by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1994,
earnings remain flat and recent settlements, for example in the car
industry, suggest that they will be higher in the 1994-95 pay round than in
1993-94,' said Mr Trinder.
Last week Rover Group announced a pay increase of about 10 per cent over two
years for its 33,000 workers.
Mr Trinder also claimed that public-sector pay is increasing in line with
whole-economy earnings at 3.75 per cent. 'If the public-sector pay bill is
frozen for 1994-95 but public-sector earnings are increasing by 3.75 per
cent then more than 200,000 jobs will have to be shed,' he said.

FT  13 OCT 94 / DTI acts to close pyramid groups
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has moved to close down two more
pyramid selling companies.
It has petitioned the High Court to wind up Powertag Programme and
Headlogic.
The DTI claims that Powertag took over the membership of the Alchemy
Foundation, a pyramid selling company wound up in July this year, with 8,000
members.
Investigators say Powertag continued 'to enlist new members into
money-making schemes which were incapable of making forecast returns to more
than a small fraction of those who participated.'
The DTI also claims Headlogic took over certain assets formerly owned by
Quillpunch, a company linked to Alchemy.

FT  13 OCT 94 / City aims to woo Russian companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London will take advantage of the Queen's state visit to
Russia next week to promote the City as Europe's leading financial centre
and attract Russian companies to London.
London has become a haven for Russia's new rich and an increasingly
important centre for deal-making involving Russian companies. Last month the
Corporation helped the Chartered Association of Russian Commercial Banks to
set up an office in London and has encouraged Polish and Georgian businesses
to set up centres in the City.
The Corporation launched a trading initiative this summer in central and
eastern Europe to promote the network of financial, legal and other
facilities offered by the City.

finding progress slower than expected, according to a survey of the region's
five main chambers of commerce.
It found confidence still rising - although at a lower rate than previously
 -in manufacturing, construction, wholesaling and tourism. Factories were
continuing to find a strong increase in orders and sales.
However, confidence was still falling in the retail sector as tax rises
continued to have an effect.
The quarterly survey by the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economic
research body at the University of Strathclyde, said results in the third
quarter did not generally live up to expectations, with wholesaling the only
sector where performance outstripped expectations.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Unemployment down 400,000 from peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unemployment fell in every UK region in September among both men and women,
according to figures released by the Department of Employment yesterday.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell by 57,879 to
2.58m, or by 28,000 to 2.57m on a seasonally adjusted basis. Unemployment
has now fallen by more than 400,000 since its peak in December 1992 and is
at its lowest level since December 1991. The unemployed now represent 9.1
per cent of the workforce, down from 9.2 per cent in August.
The Labour Force Survey, also published yesterday, indicated that the fall
in the unemployment total is at last being accompanied by a rise in
employment. The survey found that employment rose by 65,000 between the
spring and the summer and was 226,000 higher than in summer 1993. There was
a bigger rise in male than in female employment and in full-time than in
part-time work.
However, the LFS results, based on interviews conducted with households,
show a different result from the workforce in employment survey, which is
compiled from employers and showed a 35,000 fall in employment in the second
quarter of 1994. The LFS has consistently shown greater rises in employment
than the other survey.
Claimant unemployment has now fallen for eight consecutive months, and by an
average of 25,600 over the past six months, easing earlier fears that the
rate of decline might be slowing. The Department of Employment said its
estimate of the trend rate of decline was 20,000 per month.
However, unemployment is not falling as fast on the International Labour
Office figures as it is on the official definition. Rather than measure
claimants, the ILO statistics record those who say they are available, or
looking, for work. On the ILO measure, unemployment fell just 11,000 between
spring and summer.
The Department of Employment said the smaller fall in ILO unemployment might
be because people who were previously classed as economically inactive had
become sufficiently encouraged by the improved economic situation to start
looking for work.
The number of vacancies at Jobcentres rose by 2,400 to 165,900 in September,
the highest level since August 1990. However, this figure is well below the
peak level of 263,000 during the mid-1980s boom.
Employment in manufacturing rose by 9,000 in August, the second consecutive
monthly increase. However, manufacturing employment is still 34,000 lower
than in August 1993. Overtime working in manufacturing increased slightly to
8.72m hours per week, while short-term working also rose to 0.29m hours per
week.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Manufacturers push up their ability to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British manufacturers have become much more competitive over the past year,
recording a substantial rise in productivity and a fall in unit labour
costs.
Figures from the Department of Employment, published yesterday, showed that
manufacturing output per head in the three months to August was 5.3 per cent
higher than in the same period of 1993.
Over the same period, manufacturing wages and salaries per unit of output
fell by 0.8 per cent. The fall occurred because output was growing faster
than average earnings.
Three-monthly figures smooth out volatile movements and slightly flatter the
August performance. In August alone, output per head grew 4.9 per cent
compared with the year before, while unit wage costs fell 0.3 per cent.
Nevertheless, the Treasury welcomed the figures as showing that British
industry was improving its ability to compete.
The underlying rate of growth of average earnings stayed at 3.75 per cent in
the year to August. Apart from March and May, when it edged up to 4 per
cent, the annual growth rate of average earnings has been steady at 3.75 per
cent throughout 1994.
Within the earnings figures, however, there was a small rise in the
production and manufacturing sectors. In both sectors, July's underlying
annual growth rate was revised upwards from 4 per cent to 4.25 per cent, a
figure which was maintained in August.
In the services sector, the annual rate of underlying earnings growth was
unchanged at 3.5 per cent in August.
The underlying monthly figures for average earnings level out temporary
factors such as industrial disputes. The seasonally adjusted annual earnings
rate in August was 3.7 per cent, down from 3.8 per cent in July.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Average
earnings growth has remained below 4.5 per cent for 19 months, the longest
run of low earnings growth in the last 30 years.'

FT  13 OCT 94 / Early summer sales help reduce inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shift in the timing of this year's summer sales, supermarket price wars
and a fall in the petrol price all helped to lower the annual rate of
inflation last month.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday said that the retail price index
rose to 145.0 last month, with 100 representing the prices in 1987.
This was 0.2 per cent higher than the previous month, and 2.2 per cent
higher than the same period last year.
One reason for the lower inflation rate was that the cost of household
goods, clothing and footwear rose by less in September than they did last
year in the aftermath of the summer sales.
This was mainly because the price rebound after the sales largely occurred
in August this year, instead of in September as last year. This shift in the
timing meant that the annual rate of inflation for these sectors looked high
in August but slightly lower last month.
Clothing and footwear prices, for example, grew 3 per cent in September
after rising 2.2 per cent in August. This brought the cost of footwear and
clothes back to exactly the same level it was before the summer discounts,
and the same level as last year.
If the effect of the early price rebound is smoothed out by looking at a
two-monthly basis, the figures show that the overall price swing in clothing
and footwear was exactly the same as in the previous year.
Household goods rose 0.5 per cent in September compared with the previous
month after a monthly rise of 1.6 per cent in August. These rises were
slightly higher than the 2.1 per cent fall that occurred in the sales in
June and July.
They suggested that retailers remained wary of raising prices in face of
strong consumer resistance, analysts said. Indeed, some suggested that
retailers were likely to be particularly cautious about raising prices with
the new stock this autumn after a fall in retail sales last month.
Elsewhere in the index, food prices fell in September by 0.8 per cent
compared with August, with a 0.5 per cent rise in the year to September.
The fall partly reflected continued price wars in the supermarkets, with
non-seasonal food costs dropping 0.4 per cent. But it was also flattered by
a normal drop in seasonal food prices as a result of the harvests in
Britain.
Motoring costs also fell, running 0.2 per cent below the level in August and
1.8 per cent above the same level last year. The main reason for this was a
drop in the price of petrol, which had risen in August partly as a result of
the oil strike in Nigeria. The yearly trend was also flattered by the fact
that petrol prices rose last September.
Housing costs were 0.2 per cent higher in September than August, and 4 per
cent higher than a year ago, reflecting a continued rise in the average
outstanding mortgage debt.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Pension growth set to beat price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
State pensions could be raised next year at a slightly higher level than the
current rate of inflation for pensioners' households, official figures
yesterday indicated.
But family credit, income support and housing benefit are likely be raised
by slightly less than headline inflation.
The government uses September's inflation data each year to calculate the
rate at which some benefits should be raised next April, but employs
slightly different measurements of inflation for others. State pensions,
along with other payments such as unemployment, maternity and sickness
benefits, are raised according to the rate of annual growth in the all-items
retail prices index.
If the chancellor raises them in the November Budget according to
September's rate of inflation, next year's pensions should be raised by 2.2
per cent. This compares with a level of inflation for pensioners' households
of 1.9 per cent in the third quarter.
Rises in family credit, income support and housing benefit are usually
related to a a different index known as ROSSI, excluding rent, mortgage and
council tax, which was 1.8 per cent in September.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Markets 'exaggerate' fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday said he
thought bond markets were exaggerating the likely upwards movement in
inflation in the industrial countries, including Britain.
Mr George told the British-American Chamber of Commerce that financial
markets were also probably exaggerating the likely pace and size of the
increases in short-term interest rates that might be needed to keep
inflation down.
As Mr George was speaking, Britain's 10-year benchmark gilt-edged stock was
yielding about 8.77 per cent and money markets were anticipating bank base
rates of nearly 6.5 per cent in December against 5.75 per cent yesterday.
Although the governor said he had learned to be cautious before
second-guessing financial markets, his own guess was that the bond markets
'were overdoing it a bit' in their views of inflation.
He listed several reasons for supposing that the effect on inflation of the
economic expansion would be less than before. There was a policy consensus
on the importance of maintaining price stability. Efforts were being made to
cut fiscal deficits while central banks were aware of the need to tighten
monetary policy before inflation is seen in statistics.
Interest rates were high in real terms, while money and credit were growing
slowly in the big economies.
There is - in Europe at least - a 'huge overhang' of structural
unemployment. One result was that upward pressure on labour costs is likely
to be weaker than before. Competition everywhere is intense. This was an
important reason why inflation in several countries had been lower than
expected.

FT  13 OCT 94 / C4 chief coy over ITV approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, has been approached as a
possible successor to Mr Ward Thomas as chairman of the ITV company
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television.
A number of talks are believed to have been held on the issue between Mr
Thomas, who is 71 and starting to think about his successor, and Mr Grade,
whose contract with Channel 4 runs out in 1996.
However, Mr Grade, who is in Bournemouth to address the Conservative Bow
Group think tank on reforming the Channel 4 funding formula, said last night
of the approach from Yorkshire-Tyne Tees: 'There is no substance in it at
all.'
He declined to say whether he had been sounded out on the issue of the
Yorkshire chairmanship.
Mr Thomas, who was brought back to run Yorkshire-Tyne Tees after the abrupt
resignation of Mr Clive Leach nearly a year ago, has made clear that he
would like to retire at the company's annual general meeting in the summer
of 1996.
Mr Thomas would like to have a potential successor in place well before he
retires so that there could be an orderly handover.
Last year, according to the Channel 4 annual report, Mr Grade was paid
between Pounds 355,000 and Pounds 360,000. Earlier, top executives at the
channel received substantial incentives to retain their services through the
1991 ITV franchise round.
It is not clear what Yorkshire could offer Mr Grade to induce him to move,
other than generous share options.
Mr Grade's priority at the moment has been to argue for the removal of the
funding link with ITV.
The link has meant Channel 4 paying large sums to the ITV companies as part
of a complex 'insurance policy' providing financial underpinning for the
channel's minority remit. Last year Channel 4 paid Pounds 38.2m to ITV and
this year the sum could be considerably higher.
Mr Grade wants the channel to keep the money and spend it on more British
programming.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Dismissal notices received
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About 100 employees of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television are due to have
received dismissal notices by this morning because of their refusal to
accept new cost-saving terms and conditions, Chris Tighe writes.
The 100 will lose their jobs unless they give their acceptance by October
21.
Members of the National Union of Journalists and the broadcasting union
Bectu at Tyne Tees Television, the YTTV subsidiary covering north-east
England, voted yesterday to oppose the terms.
Yesterday Mr John Calvert, Tyne Tees TV managing director, said the company
had held off issuing notices in the hope that a meeting of NUJ and Bectu
members, due last night, would result in agreement. If that were not
forthcoming, he expected dismissal notices to be issued today.
The new terms would replace premium pay for overtime with flat-rate
payments. Unions say this would mean some employees' earnings dropping by up
to 40 per cent.
The management said that about half its 600 Yorkshire-based employees had
now accepted the terms unconditionally - a claim rejected by the unions.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Computer fraud rises sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attacks on public-sector and private-sector computer systems by thieves,
hackers and virus writers have increased dramatically in the past three
years, the Audit Commission said yesterday.
The rise is a consequence of the spread of personal computers and networks
but also the result of managers neglecting or refusing to put into practice
measures which could contain or reduce computer fraud and hacking.
The commission says the total value of losses caused by computer abuse has
risen 183 per cent since the last survey - the average loss per incident
caused through fraud is now Pounds 28,170.
The study - involving returns from more than 1,000 companies - shows that
the number of incidents of computer abuse reported has increased from 12 per
cent of organisations canvassed in 1991 to 36 per cent.
There has also been a 38 per cent increase in reported fraud and an
eightfold rise in the use of illicitly obtained software.
Incidents reported to the commission range from an employee who gained
access to her own and her husband's debt records and reduced them, to a
nurse who hacked into a hospital's computer system and prescribed
potentially lethal drugs for one patient and altered treatment records for
others.
The figures almost certainly understate the problem - organisations are
notoriously shy of admitting incid-ents.
Management, it says, does not impose adequate controls. It found almost 25
per cent of organisations had no internal auditing procedures, 60 per cent
did not carry out security awareness training, 50 per cent had no computer
audit skills and more than 80 per cent did not practise risk analysis.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Imminent loyalist ceasefire hinted at
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sources close to the loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland
indicated yesterday that the announcement of a ceasefire was imminent.
The Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella group for the Ulster
Defence Association, which has subsumed the Ulster Freedom Fighters, and the
separate Ulster Volunteer Force - is understood to be finalising details of
an announcement after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt.
The announcement could come by the weekend, when the Ulster Unionist party
meets for its conference - or even today, as the Conservative party
conference debates Northern Ireland.
The process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders special
permission to go into the Maze Prison on Monday to discuss the issue in
separate meetings with UDA and UVF inmates.
The CLMC is reported to be considering linking their ceasefire with a demand
for talks between their political representatives and the government, and to
saying their ceasefire will be as 'permanent' as the IRA's.
In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Ulster Unionist party leader
James Molyneaux offered to meet loyalist paramilitary leaders if they needed
reassurance about Northern Ireland's constitutional position.
The three Northern Ireland MEPs - Mr John Hume, the leader of the
nationalist SDLP, Mr John Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist party and the Rev
Ian Paisley of the hardline Democratic Unionist party - are to meet EU
Commission president Jacques Delors today.
The meeting in Brussels follows Commission pledges of economic aid in
response to the IRA ceasefire - a loyalist ceasefire is likely to boost the
prospects of assistance.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Pounds 100m boost planned for retail centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chelsfield, the property company led by Mr Elliott Bernerd, yesterday sought
planning permission from Dudley Borough Council in the West Midlands to
undertake a Pounds 100m expansion of the Merry Hill shopping centre.
The 650,000 sq ft expansion at what is already one of the four largest
shopping centres in Britain would be the biggest retail development in the
UK since the property industry moved into recession during 1990.
Its announcement follows declarations by Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, that new shopping centres outside towns are unacceptable. He has
reiterated the government's policy of sustaining the vitality of existing
town centres.
Merry Hill, on the west side of the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation,
was developed during the 1980s with the help of tax concessions. It is on
land to which the government gave enterprise zone status after the closure
of a steelworks.
Chelsfield, the leading member of a consortium which bought Merry Hill from
the receivers of Mountleigh, a failed property company, last year, is
consolidating its control of the shopping centre.
It is paying Pounds 27m to lift its stake in the consortium, MH Holdings, to
90 per cent from 50 per cent, and expects to buy the other 10 per cent next
January. The seller is a group of private Saudi Arabian investors.
Disclosure of the plans to expand the centre, which has 1.4m sq ft of shops,
excluding retail warehouses, follows discussions between Chelsfield and the
local authority, and reflects the assumption that planning permission will
be granted.
The council, which opposed the original development, fearing the loss of
trade at the traditional centres of Dudley and Stourbridge, is supporting
the expansion.
The local authority's attitude to the development has changed for three
reasons:
The expansion, based on a new department store and extensive catering
facilities, could provide 2,000 jobs.
Chelsfield is establishing training facilities so that local residents can
take up the jobs.
The company has agreed to spend Pounds 8.25m on investment projects in the
borough. This includes Pounds 1.5m on road improvements - access to Merry
Hill through highly populated districts is difficult.
Chelsfield yesterday sought to head off any objections by adopting Mr
Gummer's line on opposition to out-of-town shopping centres. It argued that,
with its adjacent hotel and office developments, the development is akin to
a traditional town centre.
It noted that Merry Hill is not on the edge of, but inside the conurbation
and that 15 per cent of its 25m customers a year arrive on foot or on public
transport.
Further, Chelsfield said, expansion is directed more at persuading existing
customers to stay longer than to attracting new visitors.

consider plans for setting up a daily spot market in gas sales to encourage
competition in the household supply market when British Gas's monopoly is
removed in 1996.
The regulator published a consultation document setting out proposals for
the operation of daily spot sales and called on operators to give their
views on what steps should be taken to develop a market.
'In order to successfully introduce sustainable competition . . . a daily
market for gas has to evolve which is fully effective and efficient,' said
Mr Mark Higson, Ofgas' director of network operations.
In the US, where the market was deregulated just over 10 years ago, a spot
market developed rapidly and now almost half the gas used is bought and sold
on a daily basis. A natural gas futures contract also trades on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
Ofgas is keen for a similar liquid and transparent market to develop in the
UK. Gas companies would have access to a marketplace for balancing customer
requirements through daily sales and purchases.
The Ofgas document discusses a balancing mechanism put forward by TransCo,
British Gas's pipelines operation, and a gas exchange suggested by Morgan
Stanley, the investment bank, Eastern Natural Gas and Manweb Gas, the gas
supply arms of the regional electricity companies, as well as other
proposals.
The regulator believes a spot market will play an important part in the
development of long-term competition and ensure that balancing the system
takes place efficiently and at minimum cost.
The need for balancing gas requirements in this way arises from the removal
of British Gas's monopoly over household supply. That will leave independent
gas distributors competing for household business, demand for which can
fluctuate sharply during the day and year.
Independent companies can ensure they meet customers' needs more effectively
if they have access to a daily source of supply. Ofgas has called for
responses by November.

The US Commerce Department yesterday took steps to ensure that the US
information superhighway reaches schools, hospitals, libraries, government
agencies and minority communities which might otherwise be left out of the
communications revolution.
Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, announced 92 grants worth Dollars
24.4m for programmes in 45 states this year. Matching funds from private and
other public sources brings the total information spending dedicated to
public institutions and under-served communities to Dollars 67.6m. In 1995,
the administration will hand out Dollars 64m, a large increase but still
well below demand.
This year applicants raised Dollars 800m in matching funds and requested
Dollars 560m in grants. Only one in 10 bids was accepted. The department's
National Institute of Standards and Technology runs a larger grant programme
to help industries research and develop new technology for the information
superhighway.
Commerce officials said that, while the private sector would develop the
information infrastructure which US companies need to remain competitive,
the government's role is to help under-served communities. 'These are public
institutions which are integral to the fabric of this nation,' said Mr Larry
Irvine, assistant commerce secretary for communications and information.
In the atmosphere of cynicism among the US electorate, grant programmes like
these are easily labelled 'pork barrel' by anti-government conservatives.
Commerce officials insisted there were no politics involved in the awarding
of only one grant to Texas - increasingly Republican territory - and 10 to
California, a key state for the president's 1996 re-election campaign.
Many of the grants read like a roll-call of traditional Democrat
constituencies in minority and low-income communities. This was deliberate,
said department officials, to avoid creating 'a society of information haves
and have nots'.
Harlem, the black community in New York City where Mr Brown grew up,
received one of the larger grants - Dollars 450,000 - for a Dollars 1.1m
project to plug six schools into an environmental learning programme. A
Dollars 156,000 grant will support a Dollars 300,000 plan for linking more
than 500 American Indian tribal governments and developing 'telemedicine',
child care, education, economic development and cultural preservation
programmes.
A Dollars 100,000 grant will go to a Korean Youth and Community Centre in
Los Angeles to develop training for community workers.

The US yesterday announced long-awaited details of its plan to issue visas
to 20,000 Cubans, promised as part of an agreement with the Castro regime
last month. A State Department spokeswoman said the government would expand
the criteria for refugee status, review previously denied refugee cases and
make visas immediately available to unmarried children of Cubans already
issued immigrant visas or granted refugee status. The government would
operate a lottery that 'will substantially broaden avenues of legal
migration for all Cubans, including those without direct family ties to the
US'. The new visa programmes would be available to Cubans now in Cuba. Those
in safe havens at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Panama
would be told about the programmes but must return home in order to
participate.

North American dominance of the 1994 Nobel prizes was underlined yesterday
when two Americans and a Canadian won the awards for physics and chemistry.
The physics prize was shared by Mr Bertram Brockhouse of McMaster University
in Hamilton, Ontario, and the Mr Clifford Shull, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, for their pioneering development of neutron
scattering techniques. Their work, carried out 40 years ago, has paved the
way for the development of new materials such as ceramic superconductors.
The chemistry prize went to Mr George Olah, of the University of Southern
California, for his contributions to carbocation chemistry. 'In simple terms
Clifford Shull has helped answer the question of where atoms 'are' and
Bertram Brockhouse the question of what atoms 'do',' said the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences when making the SKr7m (Pounds 583,300) award. The
science academy said the work of the Hungarian-born American, Mr George
Olah, had been widely recognised among organic chemists and that his work on
carbocations - positively charged hydrocarbons - had won a prominent
position in modern textbooks. Hydrocarbons are used to make gasoline,
pharmaceuticals and plastics. Seven out of the eight Nobel prizewinners
announced so far have been North American or North America based.

Panama yesterday agreed to take in Lieutenant-General Raoul Cedras, the
leader of Haiti's military coup who relinquished power on Monday. He was
expected in Panama last night just three days before the scheduled return of
exiled president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. A senior Panamanian official said:
'We received a faxed letter this afternoon from President Aristide asking
Panama to accept Cedras and we have agreed.' All day yesterday, US military
forces mounted guard on the home of the ousted general as removal vans
loaded with his possessions headed towards aircraft awaiting him at the
capital city's airport. A US embassy spokesman said that the chief coup
strategist, General Pillipe Biamby, was likely to accompany his colleague
into exile. Gen Cedras's departure follows the collapse of the government
led by de facto president Emile Jonassaint, who left the presidential palace
on Tuesday. All of Mr Jonassaint's ministers also abandoned their offices,
and US troops peacefully secured 15 different government buildings. Inside
the presidential palace, US security officers and Mr Aristide's transition
team began initial preparations to receive the legitimate president when he
arrives on Saturday.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Alberta's premier wields his axe: Budget pain is being
inflicted but nobody is crying out yet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Ralph Klein is succeeding where most politicians have failed. Determined
to balance Alberta's budget within the next two years, the premier of the
oil-rich Canadian province is chopping government programmes left, right and
centre.
His government has closed thousands of hospital beds, eliminated almost
two-thirds of the province's school boards, and turned to private enterprise
to run services as diverse as liquor stores, lawn-mowing and the issue of
birth certificates.
What is most remarkable, however, is that the deeper the cuts bite, the more
popular Mr Klein becomes. According to an opinion poll published in late
August, 61 per cent of Albertans approve of the Conservative government's
performance, up from 51 per cent four months earlier.
Mr Klein, a forthright man who acknowledges putting his foot in his mouth at
times, says the secret of his success is that 'we're keeping promises'.
'People might not like what we're doing, but they all say at least: 'You're
keeping your promise',' he said.
Mr Mike Percy, finance spokesman for the opposition Liberals, concedes that
Mr Klein has struck the right chord: 'It's the temper of the times here,' Mr
Percy says. 'People won't believe you unless you say it hurts.'
Mr Klein, who was a Calgary TV reporter before entering politics, at first
won voters' confidence by putting himself and other politicians at the front
of the firing line. Soon after taking over as premier in December 1992, he
abolished the provincial legislature's pension plan. Mr Klein says he has
sacrificed almost CDollars 60,000 (Pounds 28,300) in accrued pension
benefits himself. He has also given up his CDollars 5,000 a year allowance
for clothing and other expenses. Cabinet members took a 5 per cent pay cut.
The pain now being inflicted on Albertans is largely the result of earlier
governments' misplaced optimism about the course of oil and natural gas
prices. Alberta prospered when oil prices rose sharply in the late 1970s. By
1985, the province had accumulated a surplus of almost CDollars 12bn. Oil
royalties were squirrelled away in a Heritage Savings Fund, to be used for
long-term infrastructure investments. But the previous government failed to
trim its sails when oil and gas prices fell. Resource revenues plummeted
from almost CDollars 5bn in the fiscal year to March 1986 to less than
CDollars 2bn the following year, and then stagnated. At the same time
government spending grew by an annual average of 5.1 per cent in the five
years to 1992.
The budget surplus turned into a deficit, reaching CDollars 3.8bn last year.
Alberta's debt is expected to rise to CDollars 32bn at the end of the
current fiscal year, in effect mortgaging the Heritage Fund. Alberta has now
lost its coveted triple-A credit rating.
A carefully-timed government commission, comprised mainly of business
leaders, laid the ground for the cuts early last year by warning that 'many
of the present systems were designed to serve the province during an era of
abundance, and the current times of economic difficulty necessitate major
changes'.
Mr Klein looks easily set to reach his target of a balanced budget by
1996/97. The government recently forecast the current fiscal year's
shortfall at CDollars 1.35bn, or CDollars 205m lower than the 1994/95 budget
estimate. Unexpectedly strong oil and gas revenues make up the bulk of the
windfall. But programme spending cuts, projected at 20 per cent over four
years, remain on target.
Mr Klein has promised to reach that target without raising taxes. Alberta
remains the only Canadian province without a retail sales tax. But the
government has sharply boosted revenues from public user fees. For example,
public funding of kindergartens has been cut from 100 per cent to 58 per
cent.
The austerity drive has drawn loud protests from some groups, notably the
elderly, who worry that healthcare standards are slipping, and trade unions.
But they are a diffuse group. 'He's got a coherent strategy, and there's no
coherent opposition,' says Professor Alan Tupper, a political scientist at
the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Domestic and foreign investors
however, are cheering. Moody's, the credit-rating agency, noted in a recent
report that Alberta's deficit-reduction plan is the most aggressive among
Canada's 10 provinces.
The provincial treasurer recently brought together a high-level group of
academics, public-service officials, business leaders and unionists to chart
a course for fiscal policy once the balanced-budget target has been
achieved.
A generous tax cut is a near-certainty before the next provincial election
in three or four years' time. 'There will be something,' Mr Klein says. But
he insists that the government will be careful not to create the expectation
that 'we're just going to start throwing money at things again'.

A senior US Treasury official called on the World Bank yesterday to lend
more money for energy conservation and less for energy production. Mr Larry
Summers, treasury under-secretary for international affairs, said programmes
that end the excessive use of energy are 'strategies' that the bank must
pursue. The bank has in recent years increased its activities in the energy
conservation field and has advised many countries on restructuring their
energy sectors to reduce subsidies and introduce more efficient pricing. Mr
Summers yesterday told the Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based
research and pressure group on development issues, that the World Bank
currently lends 20 times as much for energy production as it does for energy
conservation. Mr Summers said subsidised energy prices led to waste and
needless pollution.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada is to clear the way for open competition between telephone companies,
cable-TV operators and other telecommunications providers, under a new
policy unveiled by the industry minister, Mr John Manley.
The government has directed the Canadian Radio-Television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which regulates broadcasting and
telecoms, to study the legislative changes required to bring down regulatory
barriers.
The CRTC is expected to complete its report by the end of February. 'We want
real competition, and our vision is not restricted to established
industries,' Mr Manley said.
'We fully expect - and will actively encourage - a host of new entrants. We
want competing carriers and other service providers to have full access, on
equitable terms, to the facilities of telephone companies and cable
companies, other than capacity used for broadcast signals.'
Although foreign investors are presently limited to minority stakes in
Canadian phone, cable and broadcasting companies, several have already
entered the market. AT&amp;T, for example, owns 20 per cent of Unitel, which
pioneered competition in long-distance telephone services two years ago.
Sprint, the US long-distance company, has a 25 per cent interest in Call-Net
Enterprises of Toronto, another new entrant in the long-distance market.
The CRTC last month spelt out plans to encourage competition in local
telephone services, which are presently dominated by monopolies in each of
Canada's 10 provinces. The traditional cross-subsidy of local rates by
long-distance revenues will be substantially reduced with the aim of
attracting new entrants.

<TEXT>
The US last night appeared to back away from its proposal for a military
exclusion zone in southern Iraq as the best means of containing the
long-term threat to Kuwait posed by Iraq.
The plan had earlier met with strong opposition from France, with Mr
Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, saying there was 'nothing
illegal in the movement of Iraqi forces inside Iraq'. Russia and China were
also believed to be unenthusiastic about the proposal.
A US official at the United Nations in New York said that, instead of the
exclusion zone, Washington was considering introducing a UN Security Council
resolution to forbid Iraq from deploying elite units with an offensive
potential in areas where they could threaten Kuwait. 'We want to return to
the status quo ante,' said the official. This would see Iraq reduce its
forces in southern Iraq to the level they were at before the build-up began
last week.
In spite of Iraq's claims that it had withdrawn all its forces from the
border area, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said in Kuwait
yesterday that remaining troops still posed 'an unmistakable threat'. The US
has refused to rule out a pre-emptive strike.
US officials had not made public their proposals for a military exclusion
zone, but it was thought likely to have mirrored the 'no-fly' zone south of
the 32nd parallel beyond which Iraqi aircraft risked being attacked by
allied aircraft.
Mr Christopher arrived in Kuwait for talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, British
foreign secretary, and the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council. Afterwards,
Mr Christopher, flanked by Mr Hurd, Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's
foreign minister, and Sheikh Fahim bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary-general
of the GCC, said four main agreements had been reached:
Iraq's troops must abandon their threatening posture. Never again would Iraq
be allowed to disturb the peace in the region and seek to intimidate the UN.
'We have agreed to an equitable share of the costs' (of allied military
deployment).
Each of the GCC countries would provide overflying rights for aircraft of
the allied forces.
The GCC would contribute units from its Peninsula Shield force to protect
Kuwait.
Almost 40,000 US troops are either in the Gulf or on their way there with
another 155,000 on standby.
Mr Christopher emphasised there could be no lifting of UN sanctions against
Iraq.
He said the allies had expressed 'great sympathy for the people of Iraq' but
the responsibility for their condition lay with Mr Saddam. 'The facts speak
for themselves,' he said.
'Saddam Hussein has impoverished his country and dishonoured its military.'
The Iraqi leader should be in no doubt that if he continued a policy of
intimidation 'Iraq will be devastated'.
Mr Christopher said there were signs of some Iraqi troop withdrawals from
the border area, but it was too soon to say the crisis was over. There was
among the allies 'a total lack of trust in what Saddam Hussein says'.
Mr Hurd said the UK was happy to support Kuwait 'because we believe in
standing by our friends and because the UK retains a strong interest in the
stability of this area'.
Iraq remained adamant that it would not recognise Kuwait until economic
sanctions were eased.
Mr Leotard said he believed the deployment of US forces 'was not unconnected
to domestic politics'.
However, he added: 'We are demanding that Iraq recognise the international
border with Kuwait,' as laid down in UN resolutions. France was striking a
'delicate' balance between recognising that Iraq had made some efforts to
conform with some UN resolutions and being 'intransigent' that Baghdad must
in the end fulfil all such resolutions, Mr Leotard claimed.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Doubt cast on exclusion zone in the south: Advantages seen
but feasibility questioned by IISS director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be 'very difficult' to establish a military exclusion zone in
southern Iraq analogous to that in the north, Mr John Chipman, director of
the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said in London yesterday.
However, such a zone would have definite advantages for those countries,
notably the US and UK, which have committed themselves to defend Kuwait and
'will want to alleviate the task of performing that role'.
Mr Chipman, speaking at the launch of his Institute's annual 'Military
Balance' (a review of armed forces and weapons around the world), said it
would 'require a lot of manoeuvring in the next 24-48 hours' to set up an
exclusion zone. Last night, however, there were indications at the UN that
the US was backing away from the proposal.
A zone, in which the movement of troops and associated equipment would be
prohibited, would have three advantages, he suggested:
It would make it much more difficult for Iraq to create a threat on the
Iraq-Kuwait border.
It would make it difficult for President Saddam Hussein to use his armed
forces for the purpose of repressing the Shiites in southern Iraq.
By confining the elite Republican Guard to central Iraq and denying them
access to both the north and the south, it might sow doubt in the minds of
Iraq's military leaders about the capacity of their commander-in-chief
(Saddam Hussein) to control and defend Iraqi territory.
But Mr Chipman also saw two problems with the scheme.
'First, how will it affect the relationship with other permanent members of
the Security Council, in particular Russia? Secondly, what are the political
consequences in Iraq of pushing the Republican Guard around in this way?'
There might be disadvantages as well as advantages, he suggested, in
continued uncertainty in both northern and southern Iraq.
Mr Ahmed Hashim, a research associate at the institute, added that if the
zone were established, Iraqi dissidents based in Iran might move into it,
and this 'would result in a three-way partition of the country'.
Even if the Tehran government did not favour such a development, Pasdaran
(revolutionary guard) units in southern Iran might give weapons and advice
to the Iraqi Shiite forces based in their area, who are loyal to the
'Supreme Council for the Islamic Resistance in Iraq'.
Yesterday, the Supreme Council's London office claimed that the Iraqi regime
'has transported chemical and biological weapons' into southern provinces
where there have been signs of popular unrest.
It also claimed to have reports from both central and southern Iraq that
'the Iraqi people in general are beginning to show their rejection and
criticism of the latest aggressive movements of troops towards the Kuwait
border'. They were also starting to show their rejection and criticism of

FT  13 OCT 94 / Russian envoys start Baghdad talks: They bring a
Yeltsin-approved plan urging patience in waiting for sanctions to ease

<TEXT>
Two senior Russian diplomats began talks with Iraqi leaders apparently
carrying a plan approved by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, aimed at
defusing tensions on the Iraq-Kuwait border, while telling Iraq it must be
more patient in awaiting an easing of sanctions.
Mr Igor Ivanov, first deputy foreign minister, and Mr Viktor Posuvalyuk,
director of the ministry's Middle East department, arrived after an
overnight road journey from Amman early yesterday for what diplomats in
Baghdad called a 'hastily arranged and developing programme of meetings'
with Iraqi officials.
Russian officials would not comment on the envoys' proposals, or confirm
whether the two men would travel on to Kuwait for further talks, as Moscow
officials had suggested earlier this week.
Diplomats said the two men were expected to discourage Iraq from taking what
one called 'absurd steps' in the attempt to press the UN Security Council
into an early lifting of the four-year-old oil embargo.
They said Iraq still hoped such moves could follow the Security Council's
approval of the report by Mr Rolf Ekeus, UN special envoy, that long-term
weapons monitoring systems were 'provisionally operational' in Iraq and
ready for a test period.
Iraq believes it should be given a clear period for this test, after which
sanctions would be lifted; diplomats said Baghdad has been insisting the
Security Council set specific dates.
The Russian envoys are expected to encourage Iraq to wait out a six-month
test period for long-term monitoring, a period understood to be acceptable
to most Security Council members as a fair test of Iraqi compliance.
They are expected to tell the Iraqis Russia would reward such patience by
arguing strongly after the six months for immediate moves to ease sanctions.
Support for such a scheme from France and China, along with Russia, had been
gaining ground before President Saddam Hussein's troop movements towards
Kuwait provoked the present stand-off.
Most UN diplomats believe Mr Saddam's actions have succeeded only in
reversing the diplomatic momentum Iraq had been winning.
There was no let-up in Iraq's verbal attacks on the UN or the US, with both
officials and media continuing to lambast both, for what Babel, the
newspaper owned by Saddam's son Uday, called a 'rancorous scheme against
Iraq'.
General Amer Mohammed Rasheed, director of Iraq's military industrial
commission, attacked Mr Ekeus' report as 'rife with ignorance of Iraq's
co-operation' with the UN.
Al-Thawra, official paper of the ruling Ba'ath party, accused the west of
'propagating fuss.'
Diplomats said Iraq was continuing to move its troops north of Basra
yesterday, and that both the Chinese and Russian military attaches in Iraq
were yesterday in the south of the country to confirm the withdrawals.
In Baghdad, few signs remained that the past days' tensions had affected the
city. Market traders said inflated prices for food and other basic goods had
risen in the past few days, only to return to 'normal' inflationary levels
yesterday.

A trade embargo and lack of government organisation are forcing increasing
numbers of Iraqis to go hungry, top officials from the United Nations World
Food Programme (WFP) said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
'The monthly salary of an Iraqi civil servant is barely enough to buy 1kg of
meat,' said Ms Mona Hammam, regional manager of the WFP in the Middle East.
'People are selling assets and land to make ends meet.'
The Rome-based WFP feeds 1.3m Iraqis, making it the country's largest
supplier of food, Ms Catherine Bertini, executive director, said.
The number of people needing food aid would rise if the Iraqi government
failed to improve distribution. 'The Iraqi government gives out food to
anyone who asks, instead of targeting the most vulnerable groups.'
The WFP was stockpiling food in Iraq ahead of what could be a hard winter.
Food prices had increased 600 per cent in southern and central Iraq and 84
per cent in the north. Some 23 per cent of Iraqi children were suffering
from malnutrition.

Kuwait's allies are determined to force President Saddam Hussein to abandon
his threatening attitude towards Kuwait, they said yesterday.
They were also 'actively considering what further measures needed to be
taken to ensure that Iraq never again disrupted world peace by massing tens
of thousands of troops close to Kuwait's border'.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, flanked by Mr Douglas Hurd,
British foreign secretary, Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi Arabia's foreign
minister, and Sheikh Fahim bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary-general of the
six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), said the group had reached four
main agreements:
Iraq's troops must abandon their threatening posture. Never again would Iraq
be allowed to disturb the peace in the region and seek to intimidate the UN.
'We have agreed to an equitable share of the costs' (of allied military
deployment).
Each of the GCC countries had agreed to provide overflying rights for
aircraft of the allied forces.
The GCC had agreed to contribute units from its Peninsula Shield force to
protect Kuwait.
He emphasised there could be no lifting of UN sanctions against Iraq, but
refused to be drawn on what further measures were being considered to deter
Iraqi threats. These measures include the enforcement on Iraq of a ground
forces exclusion zone.
Mr Christopher said the allies had expressed 'great sympathy for the people
of Iraq' but the responsibility for their condition lay with Mr Saddam. 'The
facts speak for themselves,' he said.
'Saddam Hussein has impoverished his country and dishonoured its military.'
The Iraqi leader should be in no doubt that if he continued a policy of
intimidation 'Iraq will be devastated'.
Mr Christopher said there were signs of some Iraqi troop withdrawals from
the border area, but it was too soon to say the crisis was over. There was
among the allies 'a total lack of trust in what Saddam Hussein says'.
Mr Hurd said the UK was happy to support Kuwait 'because we believe in
standing by our friends and because the UK retains a strong interest in the
stability of this area'. Mr Hurd stressed a military exclusion zone was one
of several options. 'Nothing has been decided.'

FT  13 OCT 94 / Beijing battens down for tricky time ahead: Rumours are
feeding anxiety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beijing, in these mellow autumn days, conveys an impression of orderliness
with the usual parade of visiting dignitaries shuffling through the Great
Hall of the People.
Chinese leaders are conspicuously conducting business as normal, receiving
visitors, holding meetings, embarking on overseas trips, exhorting the
masses to greater endeavour, while steadfastly avoiding in public the issue
of the day - the failing health of the senior leader, Deng Xiaoping.
Beneath the apparent calm the mood in the capital and in other centres is
skittish. Speculation is intense about the condition of Mr Deng, which is
said to have worsened considerably since mid-year.
Among indications of the high degree of anxiety were the wild gyrations last
week of the Shanghai stock exchange, where the index plummeted by 40 per
cent before recovering most of the lost ground on Friday, after the Foreign
Ministry issued a statement to the effect the Chinese patriarch was in 'good
health'.
While this routine bulletin calmed the markets momentarily, it will not stop
the endless rumours which clearly have become a factor in Chinese political
life, complicating a smooth transition from one generation of leaders to the
next.
Inevitably policy pronouncements, personnel changes and even the vaguest
utterances by the leadership are being viewed through the prism of what they
mean for the post-Deng era. A political transformation has been under way
for some time, but it is accelerating as the moment for Mr Deng's demise
draws nearer.
Thus, the recent fourth plenary session of the 14th Central Committee was
notable not for any significant new initiatives, but for the impression
given that the ruling party was seeking to batten down the hatches in
preparation for what promises to be a difficult time ahead.
The plenum resolution, Major Issues on Strengthening Party Building, hardly
smacked of self-confidence at an uncertain moment. The concerns expressed
indicated deep misgivings about the state of the organisation and its 54m
members.
'The Party', the plenum document stated, 'must be capable of re-organising,
enhancing and upgrading itself under the new situation of reform and
opening-up, and conscientiously study and solve the new contradictions that
crop up during its self-building'.
While the resolution made the required references to ideology, these lacked
conviction. The document also provided no sense that the party had decided
the time was ripe to strike out in new political directions to cope with the
momentous economic and social changes under way.
Chinese leaders may be seeking to convey the impression that it is 'business
as usual' in Beijing by continuing to engage in a welter of high-profile
diplomatic activity, but it seems the reform momentum is slowing for the
time being, pending Mr Deng's departure from the scene.
Observers were surprised that the party plenum failed to address economic
questions, suggesting this indicated divisions in the leadership on issues
such as the pace of reform of faltering state enterprises.
Worries about inflation, which has been running at about 30 per cent in the
cities, are casting something of a pall over the reform effort.
The strange 'end of an era' mood in Beijing was exemplified last week with
the convening of a four-day symposium marking the 2,545th anniversary of the
birth of Confucius, the sage vilified during the Cultural Revolution of the
1960s and 1970s as the patron of a 'slave-owning' aristocracy.
Now, Confucius is being hailed by the Chinese media as an exemplar of the
standards to which society should aspire. Even People's Daily, the party
newspaper and leader in its day of the campaign to excoriate Confucius,
joined the chorus.
Commending Confucian values of filial piety and altruism, the paper warned
that 'money worship' was eroding the values of society, and morality had
'lost its sacred meaning'.
It is perhaps revealing of present uncertainties that as Mr Deng, veteran
communist and father of a modernising state, shuffles from the stage, the
Confucian legacy is being rehabilitated.
These odd cross-currents seem set to continue for the time being.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Israeli kidnap puts peace in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A CORRESPONDENT

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation was facing its gravest test last night
over the kidnapping by Hamas extremists of an Israeli soldier.
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, made clear that he was holding Mr
Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, personally responsible for the fate of
19-year-old Nachshon Waxman. The soldier was kidnapped close to Ben-Gurion
airport outside Tel Aviv on Sunday, and is believed by Israel to be held in
the Palestinian autonomous area of the Gaza Strip.
Responsibility has been claimed by the military wing of Hamas. Announcing on
Tuesday that they were holding Mr Waxman, the kidnappers have said they will
kill him tomorrow unless Israel releases dozens of Palestinian prisoners,
including the Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin.
The crisis marks a moment of truth in the Israel-Palestinian autonomy
process, with Hamas clearly seeking to derail the peace accords, undermine
Mr Arafat's authority in the occupied territories, and provoke greater
opposition inside Israel to the moderate Rabin government.
Adamantly opposed to any accommodation with Israel, Hamas already appears to
have achieved some of its objectives. Israel has suspended negotiations in
Cairo with the PLO on the next stages of the autonomy process, and fuelled
further discontent among Gaza's Palestinian labour force by clamping a
closure order on the Strip that prevents workers travelling to Israel.
Mr Rabin spoke several times by telephone to Mr Arafat yesterday, urging a
search, and telling him that he regarded the crisis as a 'true test' of
relations.
A PLO official, who asked not be named, said Palestinian security forces
were due to begin arresting Hamas activists last night in an effort to
discover the whereabouts of the soldier.
'The Supreme Security Council of the Palestinian Authority has taken a
decision to continue investigations and searching for the captive soldier. .
. More extreme measures also will be taken whereby a wave of arrests of
Hamas activists will start. . . until the Palestinian (self-rule) Authority
arrives at the truth as to how he was kidnapped and where he is,' the
official said.
Israeli ministers said that, were the kidnapping to end in Mr Waxman's
death, there could be serious consequences for the future of the autonomy
process. 'If the autonomous areas turn into a shelter for murders,' said Mr
Amnon Rubinstein, education minister, 'Israel cannot be expected to expand
those areas'.
Interviewed on Israeli television last night, Sheikh Yassin urged the
kidnappers not to kill Mr Waxman. 'It would serve no purpose,' he said. 'Our
religion requires us to keep him alive and treat him well.'
Mr Arafat condemned the kidnapping and held a rare meeting with Hamas
leaders. Several of his spokesmen issued statements denying the soldier was
being held in Gaza. This denial was echoed by Hamas. 'We strongly deny the
kidnapped soldier is in the autonomous areas,' said a telephone caller
speaking on behalf of Hamas' military.
Yesterday, the kidnappers released a video showing Mr Waxman, who holds dual
US-Israeli citizenship, and who was conscripted six months ago, pleading for
his freedom. Looking dazed but controlled, he urged the government to meet
his captors' demands.
The Hamas militants also took credit for a shooting spree in central
Jerusalem on Sunday, during which two people were killed and more than a
dozen injured before the gunmen were themselves slain.
Mr Nabil Sha'ath, head of the PLO delegation to the suspended autonomy talks
in Cairo, said last night that it was 'unfair' of Israel to have broken off
the negotiations.
Israeli officials made clear that the talks had been postponed rather than
called off.

FT  13 OCT 94 / South African miracle stops at barracks: The problems of
uniting one-time military foes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela is set to intervene in a dispute between the 27,000
predominantly black, former guerrillas from the liberation movements and the
white training officers of the South African National Defence Force who have
been charged with integrating them into the national army.
In recent months, many of the former members of the armed wings of the
African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress who had been admitted
to military training camps have gone absent without leave, citing
dissatisfaction with the integration process.
In the past week nearly 7,000 of the new recruits have refused to go back
into training until their grievances, including better food and a more rapid
processing of recruits, are met.
Mr Mandela held talks on Tuesday night with Mr Joe Modise, defence minister
and former commander of the ANC's military wing, and General Georg Meiring,
SANDF chief of staff to discuss the problem and is planning to broach the
subject with army commanders today to try to resolve the crisis.
The former South African Defence Force comprised highly trained,
professional soldiers. By contrast, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) and Apla, the ANC
and PAC's guerrilla armies, tended to be relatively unstructured operations,
with few formal operating procedures or disciplinary codes.
The most common complaints appear to be boredom, dislike of military
discipline, and dissatisfaction with the cumbersome bureaucratic process
which requires them to undertake a complex set of military, medical and
educational tests to assess training and rank.
So far the dispute appears to be confined to the lower ranks and the
integration of officers is proceeding without serious difficulty. Lt-Gen
Siphiwe Nyanda, former MK chief of staff, is now chief of staff of the SANDF
and has been chairing regular meetings on the broader integration process.
But when the general tried to mediate directly on the issue last week his
car was attacked by protesters.
Mr Modise's deputy, Mr Ronnie Kasrils, also a former MK commander, admitted
that there were serious problems with the integration process but warned
that a lack of discipline could not be tolerated.
Mr Mandela defused a similar protest last month when he remonstrated with
500 protesters who had marched to the Union Buildings, the headquarters of
the administration in Pretoria, to air their grievances directly to the
president.
The problem is likely to be exacerbated in coming months by the need to
incorporate a further 10,000 soldiers from the former homeland defence
forces, as well as several thousand members from a failed National Peace
Keeping Force that was formed before April's first all-race election, into
the SANDF.
Because many of these troops have already been through some formal South
African army training, they are largely exempted from the enrolment and
assessment procedures, but will become part of the next stage of bridging
programmes leading to full integration.
Further difficulties are also likely to appear over jobs and salaries. The
government has warned that its decision this year to raise the defence
budget as well as earmarking an extra R2bn (Pounds 350m) for transitional
costs incurred during the military integration process will not be repeated
and that funds will instead be diverted into its reconstruction and
development programme.
As a result, Gen Meiring has already warned that from next year the army
will begin rationalising its personnel. The SANDF's goal is to bring the
total size of the army down to 91,000 by 1998 from about 130,000.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Tokyo hits Hoechst for Y4.4bn extra tax: German company is
appealing against assessment of transfer price manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Hoechst Japan, a unit of the German pharmaceuticals company, has paid the
Tokyo regional tax bureau Y4.4bn (Dollars 44m) in additional taxes for
allegedly transferring to Germany income taxable in Japan, it was disclosed
yesterday.
The Japanese tax authorities charged Hoechst with the additional taxes,
claiming the company had shifted Y6.4bn in taxable income to Germany between
1990 and 1992. It did so by paying more than reasonable sums for raw
materials the Japanese unit imported from its German parent, the tax
authorities allege.
Hoechst has denied the charge and countered that the Y4.4bn it has had to
pay represents double taxation, since its parent company has already paid
tax on the same amount in Germany. 'We do not believe this is fair
treatment. We do. . . . not accept the tax statement,' Hoechst said
yesterday.
The company was not making any more profits than leading Japanese
pharmaceutical companies but its gross profit ratio was in line with the
average.
German and Japanese tax officials are discussing the issue. As stipulated by
an agreement the two countries have to avoid double taxation on profits made
by companies operating in both countries. The German company was required to
pay the extra taxes before it could appeal.
Hoechst's additional tax burden in Japan was disclosed as tax authorities
from the US, Canada, Australia and Japan gathered in Sydney to discuss the
application of transfer price taxation. Under this, companies suspected of
transferring profits to the parent company through excessive payments for
materials and royalties are subject to additional taxes.
The Japanese tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in charging
foreign companies with extra taxes. Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceuticals
group, has been charged with Y5.7bn in additional taxes, while Coca-Cola
(Japan) this year suffered a Y15bn tax penalty.
The Japanese stance comes amid concern that tax revenue will fall short of
the government target. Corporate taxes have been adversely affected by
Japan's weak economy over the past few years.
The Japan Research Institute, a private think tank, for example, is
forecasting a Y1,000bn shortfall from the government's target of Y13,800bn
in corporate tax revenue for this fiscal year.

undeclared winner of last year's annulled presidential election. Chief
Abiola is on trial for alleged treason for declaring himself president in
defiance of Nigeria's military rulers.

An announcement yesterday by the finance ministry follows its decision to
raise the foreign shareholding ceiling from 10 to 15 per cent next year.
The measure is the latest indication of the government's apparent
determination to open the stock market gradually to foreign investment,
until now severely restricted.
Mr Park Jae-yoon, the new finance minister, said the band for permissible
daily stock price movements would be eased next year; the deposit
requirement for stock purchases would also be changed.

The local representative in Algiers of Daewoo, the South Korean industrial
group, was yesterday killed as the city was shaken by explosions, two of
them car bombs, David Buchan reports from Paris.
The bombs, outside the justice ministry and Algiers university, came shortly
before the trial of two alleged kidnappers is due to open before a special
court.
Earlier, the French ambassador to Algeria was summoned to the foreign
ministry, which complained that an interview given by Mr Francois Leotard,
French defence minister, constituted interference in the country's internal
affairs.
The minister had been quoted in a Saudi daily newspaper as suggesting that,
instead of suspending the 1992 election which the Algerian fundamentalists
looked like winning, the authorities should taken the risk of holding the
poll. But Mr Alain Juppe, France's foreign minister, rejected the complaint
when he told French MPs France could not stay out of the Algerian debate,
'because our interests are at stake.'

Mr Day Linin, chairman of Taiwan's securities and exchange commission,
yesterday defended his handling of a stock market crisis and resisted calls
to step down, Laura Tyson reports from Taipei.
'There is no need for me to resign over this affair, or take
responsibility,' Mr Day told the finance committee of the Legislative Yuan,
or parliament. 'I have handled the matter completely correctly, and at this
stage believe no one can handle it better.'
A string of share payment defaults amounting to TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 185m)
sent stock prices down 14.7 per cent last week.
Mr Day said he had acted in the best interests of most investors, and denied
suggestions by opposition legislators that he had sought to give advantage
to certain business groups.
President Lee Teng-hui yesterday denounced speculative practices in the
stock market. He told the party's central standing committee the finance and
justice ministries would co-operate to prosecute such activities, where
appropriate.
Share prices rebounded 6.03 per cent yesterday to 6495.78, encouraged by
government moves to support the market.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W breaches China's telecoms market

China took the first significant step in opening its telecommunications
industry to foreign companies yesterday when Cable and Wireless of the UK
announced agreement in principle for a Dollars 300m investment to build
networks.
Lord Young, C&amp;W's chairman said Hongkong Telecom, in which it owns a
majority stake, would work with Chinese partners to upgrade a cellular
telephone network in Beijing. It would also construct a 3,000km optical
fibre cable system to connect the city with Hong Kong.
The deals, which Lord Young expects to be finalised in the new year,
represent China's first concession to a foreign company to play a role in
operating telecoms networks. Hongkong Telecom's partners will be China's
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and Beijing's telecommunications
authority.
The deals heightened interest in the Chinese market among other western
telecoms operators, particularly US companies. One senior US executive said
yesterday: 'If this is the breach in the wall, we want to be the next in,
and fast.'
Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong,
said the two ventures were a significant breakthrough in China's policy.
'The Chinese authorities realise that they need foreign capital and
expertise if they are to develop the country's telecommunications network,'
he said. 'It is clear that the Chinese are now prepared to provide
equity-type returns on capital for investors.'
Other analysts were unsure if Hongkong Telecom's proposed ventures would
serve as a precedent for western operators or whether they reflected the
company's special position in China. After Hong Kong reverts to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997, Hongkong Telecom will be a company incorporated on the
Chinese mainland. China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the
Chinese government's main investment arm, owns 17 per cent of Hongkong
Telecom.
Beijing has, until now, maintained a state monopoly in telecoms services,
although the market has been open to western equipment suppliers. The
opening of the services to joint ventures with foreign operators is driven
by China's plans to modernise and expand its networks.
Analysts believe a change in market conditions has made it more difficult
for China to attract special credit facilities from equipment suppliers,
necessitating a faster than expected introduction of foreign participation
in building and operating networks.
Investors, who bought Hongkong Telecom's stock in anticipation of an
announcement, lifted the share price 5.5 per cent yesterday to HKDollars
16.30.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US antidumping rules shown to be arbitrary

<TEXT>
Mexico, a country with no indigenous television technology, now supplies 70
per cent of the television sets imported into the US market. This is the
result of the circumvention of US dumping duties on colour picture tubes
produced in Japan, Korea, Singapore and Canada, according to Mr Timothy
Regan, a spokesman for the Committee to Preserve American Colour Television
(Compact).
From all sides of the dozens of antidumping and countervailing cases brought
each year to the US Commerce Department and the International Trade
Commission, there are stories of inconsistent findings, rulings easily
circumvented, inept administration of decisions, and inadequate enforcement.
Ecuador, last month found guilty by the US Commerce Department, of 'dumping'
roses in the US market, says the 50 per cent duty to be levied will leave
10,000 Indian workers without jobs.
In the case of Ecuador, that government said the US Commerce Department was
'arbitrary and inconsistent' when it refused to let one of the defendants
correct an error on a computer tape and did not follow its usual practices
in determining the dumping margin. Mr Edgar Teran-Teran, US ambassador, said
the industry received no government subsidies. 'It is inconceivable to think
of some kind of dumping from flower growers if they receive no support.'
Cases like these form part of the record being scrutinised by the
International Trade Commission as it seeks to complete one of the broadest
investigations ever conducted on the effects of US antidumping and
countervailing duties on the economy. The results of the study are due next
June.
At a recent ITC public hearing, commissioners heard from foreign suppliers,
domestic producers, lawyers and academics, who said the 'unfair trade laws'
were themselves unfair.
Mr Jon Jenson, president of the Precision Metalforming Association, said
duties on foreign steel products had caused shortages of critical raw
materials not produced in the US. An effective mechanism had to be devised
to permit import of products in short supply.
Mr David Gridley, an official at the Torrington Company, a producer of
antifriction bearings, said many domestic shortages result from US industry
close-downs caused by dumping: 'One manifestation of harm to the domestic
industry was the delivery and other problems that flowed from reduced
capacity.'
The Copper and Brass Fabricators Council said the US Customs Service and the
US Commerce Department did not even know whether antidumping and
countervailing duties had been assessed and collected: 'Everyone assumes
that the duties are being collected, but there is no trustworthy evidence to
substantiate this claim or to ascertain the amounts of the duties.'
The US antidumping laws were 'a real world example of an existential
system', said Mr Michael Finger, World Bank chief economist. 'In antidumping
law, existence precedes essence. Essence is no more than a collection of
accidents - dumping is whatever you can get the government to act against
under the antidumping law.'

<TEXT>
Several airlines in Asia are following Singapore Airlines (SIA) and cutting
first and business class fares on regional routes. At the weekend SIA
announced it would reduce first and business class fares by between 10 and
20 per cent to 33 destinations in Asia, the south-west Pacific and South
Africa. Cathay Pacific, Thai Airways International and Qantas have now
announced similar reductions on flights out of Singapore. Malaysia Airlines
and other regional carriers are also likely to announce fare reductions.
SIA, consistently one of the world's most profitable carriers, has been hit
by growing competition from other airlines in the region and the steep
appreciation of the Singapore dollar against other regional currencies.
About 35 per cent of SIA's revenues comes from sales of first and business
class tickets. A spokesman for Qantas said that the Australian carrier had
to follow SIA in making fare reductions in order to remain competitive,
particularly on routes from Singapore to Australia.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's agricultural ministry yesterday submitted proposals to reform the
country's food control law, which governs rice production, distribution and
retailing. The legislation will replace the food control law when Japan
partially opens its rice market at the start of next year under provisions
of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade. Next year, the government will
allow rice imports up to 4 per cent of the domestic rice market. The figure
will be gradually increased to 8 per cent by the year 2000.
Under the proposed rules, any company or organisation will be allowed to buy
rice from farmers and sell it on the open market, just by notifying its
plans to the government. Currently, a state licence is required to trade or
sell rice. Consumers are unlikely to benefit fully from cheap imports, since
the legislative proposal stipulates that profits from selling imports at
around domestic prices are to be used for maintaining rice stock for
emergency use. The new bill will be submitted to the cabinet for approval
next week.

Nunn-Lugar defence conversion aid package is providing Dollars 5m for the
venture and Westinghouse will invest another Dollars 20m in technology and
equipment. Westron will update protection and control systems at Ukraine's
14 nuclear reactors at five sites. In spite of international pressure to
close its nuclear plants, Ukraine has committed itself to upgrade and
maintain the nuclear stations. No decision was reached on Chernobyl, the
site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. Other companies
interested in Ukraine's large nuclear and military-industrial complex
include ABB Combustion Engineering, part of the Swiss-Swedish engineering
concern. Orbital Systems of the US, has been approached by Kharton to find
commercial use for SS-18 carrier rockets.

Norwegian oil and natural gas producers Statoil and Norsk Hydro yesterday
announced they would invest in a natural gas pipeline in Germany. The
agreement, signed with Germany's Ruhrgas, the biggest German gas importer,
and BEB, Germany's biggest producer of gas, establishes a new company,
Netra. Netra will complete and operate a large-diameter pipeline requiring a
total investment of over DM1bn (Dollars 650m). The agreement comes just two
weeks after the completion of a competitive pipeline transmission system,
jointly owned by Gasprom of Russia and Wintershall of Germany, and
intensifies the battle between Norway and Russia over new European gas
supplies. Netra will build a 290km pipeline between Etzel, near
Wilhelmshaven in Germany, and Saltzwedel on Germany's former east-west
border.
The companies said their co-operation would increase natural gas supply
volumes from Norway to Germany and central Europe. Netra believes the
pipeline will be an important link in the growing European gas grid
integrating the gas industries of western, central and eastern Europe by a
cross-border pipeline network.

The UK's Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD) is backing Pounds 75m
(Dollars 120) worth of British exports to China with a loan value of Pounds
61m. Four recent contracts range from telecommunications and engineering to
food processing.
Davy McKee (Stockton) won a contract for the supply of a direct reduction
iron plant at Tianjin with a loan value of Dollars 22.5m and finance
arranged by West Merchant Bank. This was the first ECGD dollar buyer credit
to be arranged for the People's Construction Bank of China. The largest
contract is for an optical fibre network project which will link cities in
the provinces of Hunan and Hubei with Chonqing. The loan value is Dollars
51m with ANZ Grindlays Bank as the lead bank.
Humatt Engineering won a third contract to supply three chicken processing
plants in Yantai, Penglai and Guzhen. The plants, with a loan value of
Pounds 7.9m, are follow-on projects resulting from the success of two
similar installations at Ronqcheng and Qingzhou last year. The loan was
arranged by Samuel Montagu on behalf of Midland Bank, the lead bank, with
the Overseas Development Administration providing a grant of Pounds 4.2m.
Midland Bank was also the lead bank and Samuel Montagu arranged the loan for
the fourth contract for air preheaters for a power station at Gao Bei Dian
in Beijing. The contract was won by Howden Sirocco.
China has been one of ECGD's top markets for many years and currently has
the third highest exposure for all markets with Pounds 1.5bn insured.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Foreign operators calling Beijing's number
 -It is 'the end of a very long road and the first step on a long march'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and its principal
operating subsidiary Hongkong Telecom, yesterday resembled a cat with a bowl
of cream.
As he parried questions about Hongkong Telecom's latest deals in China, Lord
Young knew - but could not say - that he was announcing the end to China's
post-war policy of prohibiting foreign participation in the operation of
domestic telecoms services.
The implications are wide-ranging, although analysts were careful to stress
the preliminary nature of yesterday's announcement. The Chinese government
aims to increase its number of phone lines from about 30m - barely more than
the UK - to at least 110m by 2000. That is equivalent to the construction of
a telecoms network far larger than Japan's in barely six years.
Equipment suppliers familiar with China's ministry of posts and
telecommunications (MPT) have long believed it would not be possible to meet
that objective without investment and management input from western network
operators. Yesterday's announcement appears to signal Beijing's recognition
of the fact, opening the world's largest telecoms growth market to overseas
operators.
The regime for participation is likely to remain unclear for some time. C&amp;W
has still to negotiate the precise terms of its engagement in the two
networks operations unveiled yesterday, and negotiations with other
operators are still at an early stage.
But many operators besides C&amp;W have ambitions to enter China, and some
already have a foot in the door. Nynex, one of the seven US Baby Bell
regional operators, is acting as an adviser to LianTong Communications, a
recently-launched state telecoms company operating alongside the established
MPT. AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, is also exploring prospects.
In all, Hongkong Telecom expects to invest between Dollars 250m and Dollars
350m over the next two to three years, and that could just be the beginning.
For the past 15 years China's domestic telecoms market has been the Holy
Grail for Hongkong Telecom. 'We have been talking to China for years about
projects,' Lord Young said. 'The first project - which will take
three-quarters of planned expenditure - is a joint venture with Beijing's
Telecommunications Authority to upgrade, develop and share the management of
the Chinese capital's cellular telephone network.
Currently the network supports 60,000 users and 300,000 pagers. In addition
to upgrading from analogue to digital technology, Hongkong Telecom plans to
double its size of the network every year 'for the next few years'.
The second is participation in the construction and management of a
fibre-optic cable between Beijing and Hong Kong. It will undertake this
venture with the ministry of posts and telecommunications.
The cable will stretch some 3,000km - passing 80 towns and cities along the
way - and connect to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong fibre optic link. Capacity will
be increased by 80,000 lines. As with the Beijing cellular telephone deal,
Hongkong Telecom expects to participate in the management of the facility
and earn equity-type returns.
C&amp;W said it was important for Hongkong Telecom to do its first major deals
with Beijing entities, signalling the Chinese government's blessing for the
ventures. Hongkong Telecom has spent years cultivating relationships in
Guangdong, Fujian and Shanghai. After its network in Hong Kong went digital
last year it completed shipping - and installing gratis - all its analogue
telephone switches to Guangdong. 'It helped promote telephone traffic
between Guangdong and Hong Kong; it was enlightened self-interest,' he said.
In Shanghai, where Cable &amp; Wireless on Monday held its first board meeting
on the Chinese mainland, the local authorities welcomed their participation
in the city's telecommunications market. The local government is especially
keen for the company to expand telecoms in the Pudong special economic zone.
The Chinese move takes place against a backdrop of rapid liberalisation and
privatisation in the international telecoms industry. Demand for capital and
telecoms development expertise is intensifying across the developed world -
particularly in Asia - as governments seek to modernise their telecoms
networks as a key element in policies to promote economic growth.
'You could say it is the end of a very long road and the first step on a
long march,' said Lord Young. But as the Chinese say: the longest march
starts with a single step.

FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Taking the paper out of trade - The quest
for more efficient commerce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade recently put the global gains
from the Uruguay Round trade liberalising accords at an eventual Dollars
500bn a year. Next week ministers, officials and industry executives from
more than 130 countries will meet in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss how to boost
that sum by another Dollars 100bn - by cutting the costs of doing business
abroad.
The United Nations International Symposium on Trade Efficiency is focusing
on ways of making trading cheaper and easier, so enabling smaller companies
and poorer nations to exploit the global market on more equal terms with
established traders.
According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development, which is organising
the five-day symposium, the costs of voluminous paperwork, complex
formalities and associated delays and errors amount to about 10 per cent of
the final value of goods.
A typical trade transaction may involve 30 different parties, 60 original
documents and 360 document copies, all of which have to be checked,
transmitted, re-entered into various information systems, processed and
filed.
For small companies, this can be daunting, even without the additional
handicaps faced by many Third World exporters such as poor infrastructure
and cumbersome, sometimes corrupt, bureaucracies.
However, transaction costs - totalling perhaps Dollars 400bn a year by the
end of the decade - could be sliced by 25 per cent by streamlining
procedures and extending use of paperless trading, Unctad argues.
The symposium is expected to adopt recommendations for tackling problems
encountered by exporters in the areas of transport, trade information,
telecommunications, business practices, and customs and finance, with
special emphasis on the difficulties confronting smaller companies and
developing countries.
One example is computerisation to speed customs clearance, increase
government revenues and reduce opportunities for corruption. Unctad's
Automated System for Customs Data (Asycuda), used by more than 60 developing
countries, enabled Ghana and Mauritius, for example, to cut clearance times
from a week to half a day. Sri Lanka boosted revenues by Dollars 25m or 10
per cent in the first three months of operation, despite lower tariff rates.
Though more than 100 countries operate fully automated customs clearing
systems, most trade transactions are still paper-based. Errors and delays in
paperwork cost companies business and customers, Unctad says.
'With the growing trend towards purchasing 'just in time', delays
increasingly imply lost business. If local suppliers can produce and deliver
inputs within a given deadline, remote suppliers must be able to do likewise
or they will lose the market.'
The answer, Unctad believes, is paperless trading or electronic data
interchange (edi). However, to be effective all the participants in a trade
deal - companies, customs, banks, insurers, transport agents and so on -
have to use it.
Even in industrialised countries, edi is used by fewer than 7.5 per cent of
companies. For exporters in developing countries, poor telecommunications
may make edi impracticable.
Similar problems apply to that other essential of successful trading -
business information. This is increasingly available in electronic form but
many companies, especially in the Third World, could find themselves
excluded from trade if they cannot adequately exploit the new technologies.
'In a world where information has become the main strategic factor of
competitiveness, the border between trade winners and losers is often the
one that separates the haves from the have-nots of technology,' Unctad
warns.
To help prevent this gap emerging Unctad came up with the idea of a
worldwide network of 'trade points'. Since the first was set up in February
1992 in Cartagena, Colombia, trade points have been set up or are planned in
60 countries. By the end of next year 100 should be operational.
Trade points bring together under one roof all the services needed by
exporters, such as government departments, customs authorities, chambers of
commerce, banks, insurers and freight forwarders.
Through trade points companies have the possibility of using edi as well as
gaining access to computerised information on markets, potential clients and
investment partners, tariffs and trade rules worldwide.
Next week's symposium will formally launch the Global Trade Point Network,
an electronic network linking the trade points with each other and other
international networks, which Unctad hopes will become an important player
in the field of trade information and electronic trading.
Trade points already claim success in increasing the number of companies
involved in international trade and helping them trade more efficiently. Ms
Rossana Trucco del Castillo, director of the Cartagena trade point, says 70
per cent of its users are small and medium-sized companies and half are new
to international trade.

The European Commission has asked the Council of Ministers to give its
approval to a three-year-old anti-trust agreement between the EU and the US
government, after the European Court of Justice ruled it was void. The
agreement, designed to promote co-operation between competition authorities
in the US and the EU, was recently used to modify certain practices by the
US computer group, Microsoft, after both parties agreed that these violated
competition law. Originally concluded by the Commission, the court ruled in
the summer that the agreement was void, as it should have been concluded by
the Council of Ministers. France, backed by Spain and the Netherlands,
launched the court action, arguing that for an international agreement
signed with another government, it was not the Commission's place to
represent the EU, but rather a matter for the member states. The European
Court is also considering whether the Commission or member states have the
power to negotiate in certain trade areas, such as transport, services, and
intellectual property rights. The outcome of this case should allow EU
ratification of the Uruguay Round trade pact before the end of the year.

<TEXT>
Work on upgrading road and rail links along a 1,800km corridor between
Berlin and Moscow is to be co-ordinated by the European Commission and the
four governments involved under an agreement reached this week. Delegations
from Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia and the Commission have signed a
memorandum of understanding intended to ensure that European Union support
is properly targeted and to encourage private sector involvement. The
proposal to improve roads and railways and build better border crossing
points could cost between Ecu5.4bn (Pounds 4.2bn) and Ecu9bn and has already
attracted considerable interest from banks, the Commission said. Priority
projects in the scheme are road and rail links between the German border and
Warsaw, the railway between Warsaw and the Polish/Belarus border and the
border crossing between Poland and Belarus, where the railway gauge changes
and long delays occur. Work has already begun on some parts of the corridor,
but some parts of the scheme will not be completed before 2010.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Russian defence budget Dollars 79bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian defence spending is much higher in real terms than previously
estimated, according to new calculations released yesterday by the
International Institute of Strategic Studies. The 1994-95 edition of The
Military Balance, the London-based think-tank's authoritative annual survey
of the armed forces and weapons throughout the world, asserts that 'Russian
defence budgets have been effectively static in real terms' since 1992,
'with perhaps a small increase in 1994'. This contradicts assessments of
real decline in defence budgets based on the evidence of GDP decline in
official statistics - estimates which have been 'cautiously supported' by
the International Monetary Fund. The institute has roughly doubled its
previous estimates for the 1992 and 1993 Russian defence budgets to Dollars
74.6bn (Pounds 47.2bn) and Dollars 76.6bn, from Dollars 39.7bn and Dollars
29.1bn respectively, by using a new measure of purchasing-power parity. For
1994, it gives a figure of Dollars 79.0bn, adding that 'since the defence
budget does not cover all military-related activities, this estimate
represents the low end of a range of possible expenditures'. But even this
low estimate makes Russian military expenditure 'in real terms substantially
higher than that of any country apart from the US', whose 1994 defence
outlay is, however, more than three times as high (Dollars 280bn).

FT  13 OCT 94 / French ex-minister investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alain Carignon, who resigned as French communications minister in July
shortly before being charged with being in 'receipt of fraud', was yesterday
summoned to Lyons by police for questioning in an investigation which,
according to Le Monde newspaper, has been extended to allegations that the
ex-minister illegally received FFr20m (Pounds 2.4m) in gifts in cash and
kind from companies. Mr Carignon, who is still mayor of Grenoble, is linked
to an investigation by a Lyons judge into the fact that Lyonnaise des Eaux,
the utility group, assumed the debts of a pro-Carignon newspaper shortly
before the mayor's subsequent decision to let Lyonnaise des Eaux manage the
city's water supply. In the course of this investigation, the judge has
brought charges against a former Carignon aide, Mr Jean-Louis Dutaret, who
has had to resign as head of a state communications holding company. Le
Monde yesterday claimed that in the course of delving into Mr Dutaret's
affairs, the judge had come across evidence that Mr Carignon had his Paris
apartment rent and numerous air tickets paid for by companies in the water
sector.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Delors, the outgoing European Commission president, said in an
interview yesterday with the newspaper, Liberation, that he would make no
decision on whether to run for the French presidency until his Brussels
mandate ended on January 6.
This announcement came as an opinion poll for the first time put him level
with the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, in the crucial run-off vote
for the presidency, while easily outdistancing the other Gaullist contender,
Mr Jacques Chirac. The Socialist party is holding a full party congress next
month and then a mini-convention in December specifically to discuss what
sort of platform it would like a candidate to run on in May. However, few in
the Socialist party would complain if Mr Delors were subsequently to bend
that platform to suit himself. In the current presidential 'phoney war' no
mainstream contender wants to make his candidacy formal and thus open to
attack from all rivals. Mr Delors' asset at the moment is the cast-iron
pretext for silence that his Commission presidency gives him until January.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Italy's growth exceeds forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian economy grew at 2.3 per cent during the second quarter,
confirming the strength of its broad-based recovery. The figures, published
yesterday by Istat, the official statistics institute, compare with a first
quarter GDP growth of only 1.5 per cent. The change of pace between the two
quarters is the fastest in the EU, and suggests the macroeconomic
projections in the document accompanying the 1995 budget are understated.
The document forecasts growth will reach 2.7 per cent next year and 2.8 per
cent in 1997. It is also counting on 3.5 per cent inflation this year and
2.5 per cent next year, but the trend of August and September prices makes
this look unrealistic. The accelerated growth is attributed to the return of
domestic demand. Since late last year the recovery has been exclusively
export driven.
The continued weakness of French inflationary pressures was demonstrated
yesterday by the announcement that the annualised rate of inflation in
September slipped to 1.6 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent in August. The
figures were based on a 0.3 per cent increase in consumer prices in
September, compared with a 0.4 per cent increase in the same month last
year. The French government is forecasting an inflation rate of about 1.8
per cent by the end of this year and a rate of 1.9 per cent in 1995.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Serbs await 'Slobo' v 'Rado' contest: Serbia's President
Milosevic is gambling on an early victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half a century ago, the founder of modern Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito,
astonished the world by breaking with Moscow and turning the apparatus of
Stalinist repression against his comrades who remained loyal to the Soviet
dictator. Now Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the most formidable
politician to emerge from the ruins of Tito's state, is attempting a
political conjuring trick that is equally audacious.
Having built a large following, and an iron grip on the reins of government,
by playing the nationalist card, Mr Milosevic has changed tack and is now
staking his future on reconciliation with the other ex-Yugoslav republics
and the world.
The president, who once seemed to enjoy the role of international pariah, is
now basking in the approval he won by accepting a partition plan for Bosnia
and severing most links with his kinsmen there. Pro-Milosevic politicians
and journalists who formerly trumpeted the slogan of a Greater Serbia have
adjusted rapidly to the new dogma - it was never feasible to unite all Serbs
in a single state.
Professor Mihajlo Narkovic, an ideologue of the president's nationalist
movement, now says it was 'too optimistic' ever to suppose that the Serb
minorities in the other Yugoslav republics could assert the rights to
self-determination.
In the new atmosphere, few would be surprised if the president were to
recognise the government of Croatia - even at the price of surrendering some
of the Croat territories now under Serb control.
The president's transformation has placed him on a collision course with the
Serbs' other political strongman: Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian-Serb
leader, who opposes the peace plan and has virtually been abandoned - at
least for now - by his erstwhile protectors in Belgrade.
The immediate cause of this rift is the plan, which would force the
Bosnian-Serbs to surrender a third of the territory they control; but there
is also personal antipathy between the two men, and rivalry for moral
leadership of the Serbs.
Mr Karadzic, who was portrayed previously in Belgrade as the defender of an
embattled community, has been frozen out by the city's officially-guided,
pro-Milosevic media.
One of Belgrade's toughest nationalist politicians, Mr Vojislav Shefhel, has
been arrested, and there have been several compulsory retirements in the
upper ranks of the army, where senior officers have close links with
Bosnian-Serb commanders.
All these moves should shore up Mr Milosevic in his new role of conciliator.
But he is still taking a big gamble.
If he succeeds, he could be held up as the man who guided the Serbs back
into the European mainstream. If he fails, he could be branded as a cynic
who sacrificed his fellow Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.
In Pale, the straggling village which is 'capital' of the Bosnian Serb
republic, there is bitterness and disbelief at the community's apparent
abandonment by Belgrade. So far, there is a reluctance among Pale's
residents to blame Mr Milosevic personally.
'The Americans were putting pressure on Milosevic and he could not continue
the back-up,' says Mr Slavisha Rakovic, one of the 250 government officials
who rub shoulders with soldiers, peasants and farm animals on the narrow
streets of Pale.
Officially, the Bosnian Serbs are preparing a self-sufficiency plan which
will enable them to fight without Belgrade's help. But privately, they
acknowledge this is impossible. 'Let's be honest, we can't survive without
Serbia,' said one official in Pale.
Since Mr Milosevic closed the border with Bosnia, the crisis in Bosnian-Serb
territory has risen, and the shops look bare. There is only a handful of
vehicles on the road, and ironically, people rely on Croat smugglers for
fuel. Yet so far, the plight of the Bosnian Serbs is not doing much damage
to the standing of Mr Milosevic, because his control of the Belgrade media
helps keep this issue out of the public eye.
Mr Milosevic is also widely believed to be meddling in the politics of the
Serb community in Croatia, hoping to remove obstacles to a reconciliation
with Zagreb.
One of the trump cards of Mr Karadzic is that he controls supply lines
between Belgrade and many Serb-controlled towns in Croatia. But he loses
this advantage if Mr Milosevic makes peace with Zagreb.
Critics of Mr Milosevic insist that he will pay a heavy price for abandoning
his kinsmen in Bosnia and Croatia. 'Milosevic does not have support for his
new policy . . . most people are against the embargo on the Bosnian-Serbs,'
says Mr Vajisrav Kostunica, a nationalist politician in Belgrade. He sees
the church and the army as forces of resistance to the new policies of Mr
Milosevic, whose power base is strongest in the police.
Mr Kostunica warned that the army already had reason not to be satisfied,
including the fact that the police had been treated better than them.
He thinks Mr Milosevic is afraid to call an election. Yet ultimately, the
president's best hopes may lie in the deferential attitude of many Serbian
voters, who have succumbed to his propaganda before and may be persuaded
that whatever 'Slobo' says, goes.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's dentists yesterday threatened to stop treating routine cases in a
row over funding.
The KZBV, an organisation which represents two-thirds of Germany's 70,000
dentists, said its members would only handle emergencies because they had
treated more patients than expected this year and would probably exceed
their DM10.5bn budget for 1994.
There have been only three cases where patients have been turned away but
the news still made headlines in most newspapers, days before the Germans
elect a new government. However, whatever political capital the dentists
were hoping to make may have misfired.
Politicians of all persuasions lambasted them for insensitivity. 'The
dentists seem to think that the last week before the election is a good
point to try and blackmail politicians,' said Ms Annelies Klug, the health
ministry spokeswoman. 'It seems they have been rather mistaken.'
The dentists' threats are another in a long line of outbursts from various
medical lobbies beginning to feel the pinch of the German health reforms.
The system has become world famous for its generosity. Everyone who is
insured is, for instance, entitled to a spa trip, almost free of charge,
once every three years.
But the system also caters for more far-fetched wishes. There is even
provision for women who find their chest size disturbs them. If they can
produce a letter from a psychologist which provides evidence of
psychological distress due to breast size then whatever treatment is
necessary can be charged to the Krankenkassen, or health insurance funds.
'People have ideas in this country about what they are entitled to which are
simply too grandiose,' said Dr Jurgen Simonsmeier, a dentist at the Medeco
clinic in Bonn. 'They've simply been incorrectly educated.'
Now, as the country pulls out of its worst post-war recession there is a
growing realisation that health insurance on this scale can no longer be
financed.
The dental budget was one of the first symptoms of this new thinking,
introduced for the first time last year when it became clear that the system
was heading for a DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) deficit, according to Ms Klug.
However, many dentists warned yesterday they would be unable to work with
budgets in the long run and that patients would simply have to pay for
anything on top of the most basic treatment. 'The all-or-nothing principle
on which health insurance is based in this country is going to have to be
reviewed,' said a KZBV spokesman.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Car sales up 3.8% in September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
West European new car sales rose by an estimated 3.8 per cent in September
to 868,200 from 836,200 a year ago, according to provisional figures from
Acea, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, released yesterday.
The pace of the recovery has slowed in the last three months chiefly because
of the weakness of the German new car market, where sales are estimated to
have fallen last month by 4 per cent year-on-year to 245,400.
In the first nine months new car sales in west Europe have risen by 5 per
cent year-on-year to 9.25m, a modest recovery following a decline of more
than 15 per cent in 1993.
Sales have risen strongly in France, Spain and Scandinavia, but have
declined in both Germany and Italy. New car sales in September declined in
seven of 17 markets across west Europe compared with falls in five markets
in the first nine months.
Most significantly, a change in the system for reporting new car sales in
Italy has revealed that previous Italian data had exaggerated the size of
the Italian market by around 200,000 cars a year. The previous use of
figures for wholesale deliveries to dealers rather than domestic
registration figures has distorted the size of the market by including the
high volume of cars being re-exported from Italy to neighbouring countries.
Car prices in Italy are among the lowest in Europe following the devaluation
of the lira.
The new reporting system means Fiat has now been relegated to sixth place in
the west European market. At the end of the 1980s Fiat was challenging the
Volkswagen group for leadership of the west European market, but the sharp
decline in its fortunes along with the fall in the Italian market mean it
now has the smallest market share of any of the big six carmakers.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Moscow's star wanes with rouble: John Lloyd measures
reaction in Vladivostock to the currency's collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar was selling at 4,000 roubles in Vladivostock's banks yesterday
and it cost Rbs4,300 to buy. At one point, it had a street price of 7,000,
as rumours spread that Dialog Bank in Moscow had pushed the rate down to
over 6,000, but there were few takers.
Russia's Far Eastern port, semi-detached from a capital eight time zones
away across the Siberian tundra, reacts more nervously even than Moscow to
falls in the currency. Its surface glitter is buoyed by trade  - over 80 per
cent of the cars are secondhand Japanese imports and the dowdy shops offer a
profusion of Japanese, South Korean, Australian and US goods.
Mr Sergei Frank, vice president of the 160-vessel, Far East Shipping Company
 -the star stock on Vladivostock's active little stock exchange - says:
'It's good and bad. Good because we are paid largely in dollars and our
costs are largely in roubles, so we have just had a 30 per cent cut in our
cost structure. But bad because it will hit imports and thus our trade: and
it means continuing instability. We had forecast the rate of Rbs3,000-3,500
to the dollar by the end of the year, based on the ministry of the economy
forecasts. We pay Rbs6bn a year in taxes for this for the politicians in
Moscow not doing their job.'
Other comments reflected this ambiguous reaction. Mr Andrei Malyutin, deputy
head of the stock exchange, said: 'This will be good for the exchange,
especially for foreign investors. It will mean stocks here are even
cheaper.' Mr Andrew Fox, a Briton whose Pacific Gemini company is the sole
foreign company allowed to trade on Vladivostock's developing market, said:
'A New York investor described the Russian market now as a 'lolly grab'.
This just increases the size of the lolly grab.'
However, Mr Nikolai Pimenov, the first deputy governor of the region
responsible for its economy - and thus for the economic well-being of the
more than three million citizens - was more gloomy. 'It's just awful. All
imports will cost 30 per cent more and our standard of living depends so
much on imports because people don't buy Russian goods. A secondhand
Japanese car is a third the price of a Russian Lada and there's no
comparison in quality. Besides this must mean a rise in inflation.'
The Far Eastern region has been flirting with thoughts of becoming an
autonomous republic and, though serious opinion discounts the possibility,
Moscow's failure to hold the currency played into the grievances of a
peripheral nation which is testing its commercial strength.

FT  13 OCT 94 / German Elections: Where the only tax promises are to pay
more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The benighted German taxpayers have good reason to feel confused. Every
party competing for their votes in the general election next Sunday is
adamant that their welfare is of paramount importance. Yet the one certainty
facing every taxpayer is that next year their bills will rise.
If the present government is re-elected, they know they will have to pay a
swingeing 'solidarity surcharge' of an extra 7.5 per cent on income tax to
finance the soaring costs of German unification and the resulting debt
burden.
They have already had to pay a sharp increase in oil taxes this year, and
there will be another increase in insurance taxation, property taxation and
a new social security charge to pay for nursing care insurance from January.
In the past four years, since the general election in 1990, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's liberal-conservative coalition has raised the revenues from
taxation and social insurance by DM116bn (Pounds 47.5bn) to a record
DM750bn.
The exchequer has been hit not only by the costs of unification, with
massive transfers from west to east of around DM150bn a year to pay for
unemployment benefit, pensions, subsidising local government, and a huge
investment in new infrastructure. Its tax revenues have been simultaneously
squeezed by the sharp recession in the German economy over the past two
years. And it now faces an accumulated debt burden which is absorbing 24 per
cent of available tax revenues each year in interest payments alone.
The resulting series of sharp tax rises is what Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the
finance-minister-in-waiting of Germany's opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD), describes as 'the great tax lie'. For Mr Kohl and his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) had promised that German unification could be
financed without any tax increases at all.
Mr Lafontaine and his party leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, have deliberately
raised the issue of taxation to the top of the election agenda in an effort
to persuade the voters that they will be more responsible with the public
purse than Mr Kohl and his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel.
They describe their own plans modestly as 'the biggest tax-cutting programme
for normal income-earners and families in the history of the federal
republic'.
Their aim is to shift the tax burden from the lower-paid to the wealthy,
without any overall increase in the tax take of the state. They would scrap
the plans for a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' and replace it with a 10
per cent charge on the top one in five income-earners.
They would raise monthly cash payments for each child in a family to DM250,
instead of the present system of tax allowances. And from 1996, they would
raise the income tax threshold to a new 'subsistence level' of DM13,000.
For a party traditionally associated with high taxation, and high welfare
payments, it is a gamble. And the indications are that in spite of the
government's sorry record, it may not pay off.
Both sides are adamant that the other's figures do not add up. They are
probably both right.
For a start, Mr Lafontaine and his allies accuse Mr Waigel of cooking his
budget books, with secret plans for further increases in value added tax and
oil tax in the pipeline.
The government has promised to take further action next year to reduce
taxation on the business sector, as part of its drive to make German
industry more internationally competitive. But Mr Waigel refuses to say how
he will finance the new deal. He simply denies that he has any plans to
increase VAT.
'We fear that the facts are so bleak, the government would rather say
nothing until the election is over,' says Mr Heribert Juchems, chief
executive of the association of independent entrepreneurs.
As for the opposition, Mr Waigel maintains that in replacing the solidarity
surcharge alone, Mr Lafontaine will be creating a financing gap of DM7bn. If
he is to produce the same revenue as the government's 7.5 per cent tax
increase, he will have to levy his 10 per cent charge on all incomes over
DM44,000 a year, the finance ministry maintains. And that means hitting a
large number of average income-earners, rather than simply the relatively
wealthy.
The irony is that in seeking to be as precise as possible in spelling out
his tax plans, and by insisting that he will not raise the government's net
borrowing requirement, Mr Lafontaine appears to have frightened off as many
voters as he has attracted.
Both sides know that the pressures on the public purse can only get worse in
the coming years. Social spending in particular is in urgent need of reform
because of the growing numbers of old people and the young, in relation to
the working population. That will be the greatest challenge for the next
German government. The taxpayer only knows it will cost more before it costs
less.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Brussels approves Pounds 1.33bn rescue for Bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European commission yesterday approved state aid totalling FFr11.1bn
(Pounds 1.33bn) for Groupe Bull, clearing the way for a rescue package for
France's loss-making computer group and its eventual privatisation.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said the decision complied
with community guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring
companies, and that he was confident this would be a one-time, last-time
payment.
Yesterday's ruling will raise again the sensitive subject of state aid and
the commission's commitment to stop market distortions. But the Bull case
prompted less anger than a decision earlier this year to approve a capital
injection of FFr20bn for Air France, the state-owned airline.
The commission said that none of Brussels' 17 commissioners had opposed the
payment. 'Subsidies can have a positive effect on employment and
competitiveness in Europe without damaging other business,' the commission
said.
Rival computer groups expressed resignation to the commission's ruling. 'We
have always said that are against state aid because we want a level playing
field,' said ICL, the UK computer group controlled by Fujitsu of Japan. But
the company had not lobbied strongly in this case. 'We have undertaken our
own restructuring and are much further down the road than Bull,' a spokesman
said.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, welcomed the decision and
said the government hoped to privatise Bull in coming months. 'The green
light from the commission is an important step in Bull's recovery,' he said.
A tender would be launched over the next few weeks for financial and
industrial groups seeking to take shares in the computer company.
The company, along with its state shareholder, is already engaged in
negotiations with potential partners.
Bull yesterday declined to comment on possible investors, although industry
observers believe NEC could increase its 4.4 per cent stake. the French
group. IBM, which holds 2.1 per cent of Bull's shares, has indicated it is
reluctant to raise its investment.
Mr Van Miert said he was satisfied Bull passed five key tests on which he
based his decision to allow the aid to be paid. These were that; the company
must be restored to profitability within a 'reasonable' time; measures must
be taken to offset any adverse effects on competitors; the aid must be kept
to the strict minimum needed; the restructuring plan must be implemented in
full; there must be detailed reports to monitor progress.
The French government has argued that capital injections are a vital element
in a restructuring package aimed at restoring the group to profitability
after accumulated losses of more than FFr15bn since 1989. Of the FFr11.1bn
pledged to Bull since 1993, all but FFr3.1bn has been transferred to the
company.
According to Bull, the restructuring measures, which include job cuts, the
reduction of its Paris sites, and the re-organisation of the company into
separate profit centres, have already yielded results. In the first half of
the year, losses were reduced to FFr843m compared with FFr1.98bn for the
first half of 1993.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Economic reform from Yeltsin needs a miracle, says Fyodorov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Boris Fyodorov, a former minister of finance and a long-standing critic
of the present administration, yesterday said that 'without some sort of
miracle' President Boris Yeltsin's government was unlikely to undertake
comprehensive economic reforms.
Some Russian ministers have suggested that this week's dramatic collapse of
the rouble could be the prelude to a stabilisation programme, but Mr
Fyodorov, a leading proponent of market reforms before he left the cabinet,
disagreed.
'I think with the current government, all we can expect is a scenario of
drifting mediocrity,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'I doubt whether there will be real
reforms, whether real stabilisation will begin.'
On these grounds, Mr Fyodorov, who has served as Russian representative to
the World Bank, urged western countries and western financial institutions
not to extend further credits to Russia.
'Who needs the money?' Mr Fyodorov, one of Russia's most respected
economists, asked. 'We have more money in Russia than in some western
countries.' Arguing that Russia is hobbled by a lack of political will
rather than of capital, Mr Fyodorov said that by giving financial assistance
to Mr Yeltsin's government, the west was repeating the mistakes it made in
its dealings with the Gorbachev administration.
'It is like the late Gorbachev period, when everyone was throwing money at
him to no purpose,' Mr Fyodorov said. 'You are supporting a person and
forgetting the country.'
As a long-time backer of radical market reforms, Mr Fyodorov has been a
frequent critic of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank governor, whom
President Boris Yeltsin sought to oust yesterday. But Mr Fyodorov dismissed
Mr Yeltsin's move as 'a search for scapegoats'.
'The problem is not with Gerashchenko or with Dubinin (Mr Sergei Dubinin,
the acting minister of finance who was sacked yesterday),' Mr Fyodorov said.
'The question is whether there will be a reconsideration of the government's
policies.
'I think Mr Gerashchenko is the best survivor, I don't believe he will be
pushed out,' Mr Fyodorov said.
While he is dubious about the chances the current government will be
converted to radical market reforms, he suspects members of the
administration have learned the principle of taking care of oneself.
Like other senior Russian politicians, Mr Fyodorov suspects significant
insider trading took place when the rouble collapsed on Tuesday. 'Some
people may have been trying to help the budget,' he said. 'But other people
were trying to help themselves . . . I think many people may be planning to
leave the government soon.'
Mr Fyodorov also rejected the argument that the collapse in the rouble may
help the economy by making Russian exports more competitive. 'The rouble is
undervalued now, and it was undervalued two weeks ago (before the recent
collapse),' he said. 'Its ridiculous when you have the GDP of a country the
size of Russia that looks like the balance sheet of Barclays or Natwest.'
But, notwithstanding his pessimistic outlook on Russian central government
policy, Mr Fyodorov was confident that foreign investment would continue to
flow into Russian industries with export capacity.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Pressure grows for tighter state aid rules: In the wake of
the Bull case, Brussels faces criticism for being too soft on subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's decision to allow the French government to pay
Bull, the ailing French computer group, FFr11bn (Pounds 1.32bn) of state
aid, will again put Brussels' record on ensuring fair competition under a
critical spotlight.
It comes only three months after the commission allowed a vast capital
injection of FFr20bn of state funds to the bankrupt Air France and, while
the Commission argues that this latest case is different, this is bound to
fuel criticism of Brussels' approach to state aids.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, has always argued -
realistically - that decisions on state aid cannot be taken in a vacuum. He
takes the view that political and social factors have to be considered, as
well as the likelihood of returning an enterprise to viability, which he
believes to be high in the case of Bull.
But there is concern among some in the commission, and certainly within
industry that the commission is treading too softly, and that member states
have become adept at getting their own way.
Following the succession of high-profile airline cases over the summer -
handled by the transport directorate and not Mr Van Miert's competition
directorate - pressure is growing for a change in the procedures for
assessing state aids.
'At the moment we have a very heavy administrative system but with results
that are not very convincing,' said a commission official. 'Industry is
complaining about the lack of neutrality and transparency, the length of
procedures, and the distorting effects of sectoral agreements covering areas
such as textiles, synthetic fibres and cars.'
A paper produced last month by the commission's industry directorate
identified the need to tighten up procedures.
'Since the removal of internal frontiers (within the European Union), the
risks of dominant positions and the distortions caused by state aid  - which
remain too great - are growing appreciably,' it said.
One of the main problems identified in the paper was the need to make
existing procedures more efficient and more transparent.
This theme was also taken up by the Confederation of British Industry in a
pamphlet entitled Controlling State Aid. It argued that deadlines need to be
set for the formal examination of state aid cases.
'The five years that passed before action was taken and decisions were
reached in the Ilva Italian steel case was quite unacceptable,' it says.
It also argued that recovery procedures for illegal aid needed to be
tightened, citing the case of a Belgian textiles company which, eight years
after a state aid payment had been found illegal by the European court of
justice, had still not paid back the money.
On transparency, the CBI points out that at present it is difficult for
interested third parties to contribute information or views at an early
stage when the commission is considering whether there is in principle a
case to answer.
The industry directorate says the same: 'Third parties are not as involved
in procedures as they are, for example, in merger cases. There should be
more consultation.'
Mr Nick Forwood QC, who specialises in state aid cases says: 'Procedurally,
it is still very much in the hands of the commissioners to decide what is in
the interests of the community. The majority tend to perceive cases not in
terms of competition, but more in terms of specific interests.'
The second problem is that regional exemptions and industry agreements allow
some state aid to go unchallenged.
'The instruction of state aid files is not neutral because you have a
combination of sectoral and horizontal frameworks which lead to different
treatments for different industries without any real justification,' said an
official from the competition directorate.
'It seems to me that big investments made in regions where the levels of
subsidy allowed are very high, have probably resulted in distortions of
competition,' said another official.
Similarly distorting are industry agreements covering sectors such as
textiles, synthetic fibres and cars introduced originally for economic or
serious structural reasons. 'These are the result of special situations,'
said a commission official, 'but they then seem to be kept for ever.'
All these points are currently the subject of discussion in the industry and
competition directorates but it is unclear yet whether new proposals will be
put to the commission.
However, there is no denying that governments are getting better at
presenting their cases on state aid in a way that allows them to 'get
around' Brussels. With the rate of negative decisions on state aids last
year only 1.05 per cent, there is scope for the commission to tighten
procedures and close some of the loopholes.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Inflation falls to lowest level for 27 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, PHILIP COGGAN and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The underlying rate of inflation in the UK fell to its lowest level for at
least 27 years in September, providing a boost to the Conservatives.
Unemployment also fell for the eighth consecutive month, bringing the
numbers claiming benefit down to levels last seen in 1991.
Unchanged average earnings growth in August was a further pointer to the
increasingly healthy nature of the UK's economic recovery. This suggested
pay settlements were not yet threatening to boost inflation.
The Treasury hailed the data as evidence that the country was now on course
to achieve the unusual combination of steady growth with low inflation.
Although some City analysts suspect the current low rate of inflation may
not be sustained in coming months, Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank
of England, suggested financial markets were being too pessimistic about
inflation.
The Central Statistical Office yesterday announced that the annual rate of
retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, was 2 per cent
in September - the lowest annual rate for what the government considers
'underlying' inflation since 1967.
The headline inflation rate also fell. The annual growth rate in the retail
prices index, covering all items, was 2.2 per cent in September compared
with 2.4 per cent in August. Last month's low price rise is likely to prove
particularly significant for next month's budget, since September's index
will form the basis for the rate at which state pensions and other benefits
will rise.
The data were welcomed in the City, which had forecast a higher rate of
inflation in September following a surprise August rise. Although inflation
may rise later this year, reflecting tax increases and commodity price
rises, yesterday's figures suggest that the picture is benign.
The overall figures were slightly flattered by volatile factors such as a
dip in petrol prices. But price growth in most retail categories remained
low, suggesting that underlying inflationary pressures were weak.
Further data from the Department of Employment yesterday suggested that
falling unemployment was not resulting in pressure for higher wages.
The numbers claiming unemployment benefit fell by a seasonally adjusted
28,000 in September to 2.57m, or 9.1 per cent of the workforce, its lowest
level since December 1991. However, the underlying annual rate of average
earnings growth was unchanged at 3.75 per cent in August.

FT  13 OCT 94 / GEC may make cash offer for VSEL to foil BAe bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC is considering making a cash offer for VSEL, the submarine maker, to
counter an agreed all-share bid launched yesterday by British Aerospace. GEC
has asked Morgan Grenfell, VSEL's adviser, for information which has been
made available to BAe in the course of negotiations.
GEC is entitled to do this under takeover panel rules if it is seriously
considering a counterbid. The company refused to comment on whether or not
it had asked Morgan Grenfell for the information.
BAe unveiled its Pounds 478.5m agreed bid for the Barrow-based submarine
maker yesterday morning, valuing each VSEL share at approximately Pounds
12.60. BAe has offered 2.747 of its own shares for each VSEL share, with an
alternative offer of Pounds 11.40 per share in cash.
VSEL's directors have recommended BAe's offer. Lord Chalfont, the chairman,
said, 'This deal will allow the company to look forward to orders it might
not otherwise have secured.'
BAe is interested in VSEL because it wishes to extend its interests in
shipbuilding, applying the project management skills it has developed in
aircraft to other military businesses.
GEC owns the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde which makes most frigates for the
Royal Navy. It wants to buy VSEL to increase the amount of business it does
as a project manager, rather than acting as an electronics subcontractor to
BAe.
Both companies have their eye on the Pounds 2.5bn contract to build the next
generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines, and the Pounds 500m
contract for marine landing ships which would be built at VSEL in Barrow.
They are the largest naval contracts likely to be placed until the Pounds
6bn new generation frigate comes on stream in 2002. Both BAe and GEC are
involved in the frigate programme.
GEC would face competition difficulties from the Ministry of Defence if it
bid for VSEL because it would then own the two large warship yards left in
the UK. The Royal Navy is thought to be particularly unhappy with one
company owning both yards. BAe's bid has received provisional clearance from
the MoD.
Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe's defence subsidiary, said companies bidding
for naval work needed a manufacturing yard to be credible with buyers.
Buying VSEL has strong financial attractions for BAe. VSEL's large cash pile
would cut BAe's gearing to 10 per cent and increase BAe's assets from Pounds
1.056bn to Pounds 1.329bn. Tax advantages mean that VSEL's profits would
also increase BAe's earnings substantially.
GEC, however, can offer cash. Including money in joint ventures, it has
almost Pounds 3bn in cash.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Portillo attacks EU interference: Minister tells Tories -
'Sometimes you have to tell Brussels when to stop'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOURNEMOUTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo established himself yesterday as the unchallenged leader
of the Tory right as cabinet divisions over Europe were exposed again at the
party's Bournemouth conference.
In a confident and carefully calculated performance which won thunderous
applause, the employment secretary launched a fierce attack on interference
from Brussels and a passionate defence of British institutions and
sovereignty.
Anticipating an intense debate within the government ahead of the 1996
intergovernmental conference, Mr Portillo said bluntly: 'Sometimes you have
to tell Brussels when to stop.'
His first conference speech as a cabinet minister came as Mr Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor, prepared to tell representatives today that the economic upturn
would bring a strong revival in the government's political fortunes before
the next general election.
But Mr Clarke was expected to combine a firm promise of eventual tax cuts
with a warning that the government would have first to make further cuts in
public spending programmes and bring down sharply the level of public
borrowing.
Senior ministers are bracing themselves also for a grassroots backlash today
over the government's perceived failure to bring down crime rates and over
its refusal to contemplate full constitutional integration of Northern
Ireland into the UK.
The fresh discord over Europe coincided with a by-election threat after the
death of Mr John Blackburn, Conservative MP for Dudley West. Senior
ministers were pessimistic about the chances of holding a seat at which the
party had a majority of only 5,798 at the last general election. A
by-election defeat would reduce Mr John Major's Westminster majority to just
13 seats.
Mr Portillo insisted his comments on Europe were in line with government
policy and was at pains to repudiate the view of Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, that Britain might have to consider withdrawal from the
European Union.
He added that the cabinet was 'absolutely united' on the need to reduce
interference from Brussels in the everyday lives of British citizens.
But the Eurosceptic tone of the speech - Mr Portillo said the government
would 'stop the rot' from Brussels - provoked a counterblast from Mr Michael
Heseltine, the pro-European trade and industry secretary.
Echoing a warning from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, earlier in
the week that Britain could not turn its back on Europe, Mr Heseltine said a
central role was vital for Britain's economic self-interest. He added: 'Our
choice is to influence what is happening - or let others set the rules. That
is why the prime minister is right to talk of a Britain at the heart of
Europe.'
But on a day when rightwing ministers appeared determined to set the agenda,
Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary, and Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, joined Mr Portillo in
strongly repudiating any further European integration.
In a clear indication of the growing irritation in Brussels at attacks on
the EU by Tory right-wingers, Sir Leon Brittan, European trade commissioner,
warned the UK could be damaged by sniping from the sidelines.
Sir Leon said in Brussels that an 'open and sensible Europe' was impossible
'if we pander to lesser emotions and imply that our partners are not our
friends.' Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
defence secretary, ruled out a looser relationship with the EU.

FT  13 OCT 94 / Ulster loyalists set to call ceasefire today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospects for a permanent end to sectarian violence in Northern Ireland
increased dramatically last night, after sources close to the loyalist
paramilitary groups indicated a ceasefire announcement could come today.
Representatives of the Combined Loyalist Military Command - the umbrella
group for all loyalist paramilitaries - are to hold a press conference
today, after reaching agreement in principle to call a halt. The ceasefire
is expected to start at the weekend.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said a ceasefire was overdue
but would be welcomed. 'We would want to see if it was conditional or
unconditional. We would want, of course, to see if it was permanent,' he
said in Bournemouth.
'We would look at it in precisely the same way as we look at the republican
ceasefire announcement of the 31st of August.'
An announcement today would be opportune timing for the government, with the
Conservative conference due to debate the situation in the province this
afternoon.
Proceedings are likely to be heated, with the party's grassroots in the
province seeking backing for an amendment urging the government actively to
persuade Ulster that its best future lies within the UK.
The announcement would also come just before Saturday's Ulster Unionist
party conference in Carrickfergus.
The peace process speeded up when the government gave loyalist leaders
permission to enter the Maze Prison on Monday to hold talks with Ulster
Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force inmates.
Ministers in Bournemouth predicted today's move could pave the way for the
UK government to give a conditional acknowledgement next week that the IRA
intends its cessation of violence to be permanent.
In the absence of an unequivocal IRA statement that it has permanently
renounced terrorism, senior ministers have been discussing a formula under
which they would state that it was their 'working assumption' that the IRA
had renounced violence.
That in turn would pave the way for an early lifting of the exclusion orders
which prevent prominent members of Sinn Fein travelling to mainland Britain.
It would also signal that the London government would be ready to engage
soon in 'talks about talks' with Sinn Fein. It was also clear last night
that the loyalist paramilitary organisations could not expect a place at the
negotiating table to discuss a new constitutional structure for Northern
Ireland. Ministers said the groups had 'no democratic mandate'.
Rev Roy Magee, a Belfast minister who has had talks with loyalist
paramilitary groups and is said to be close to loyalist opinion, indicated
that political representatives of the paramilitaries will seek a place at
the table in any talks which include Sinn Fein. 'Their views must be taken
on board,' he said.

<TEXT>
The transfer of sovereignty away from member states to European Union
institutions remains at the core of European unification, Mr Roman Herzog,
the German president, told a group of Belgian businessmen yesterday.
'This conviction of the founding fathers . . . has lost none of its
importance nor of its topicality,' he said, addressing the problem of how to
fashion a union of 20 or more member states as more countries queue up to
join. His forthright endorsement of a united Europe comes at a time when
governments are playing down the emphasis on further integration and
highlighting, to increasingly sceptical citizens, that national governments
remain in charge of the European Union.
But speaking to the Federation of Belgian Enterprise, Mr Herzog said the
German presidency of the Union - which comes to an end in December  - had
allowed a united Germany to show that it still subscribed wholeheartedly to
a united Europe.
'The conclusion of the Maastricht treaty allowed the Union to take a big
step forward,' he said. 'That is not to say that in the face of new
challenges, the Union will not have to work to win the confidence of its
citizens, and in some instances, win it back.'
Addressing the principal theme of the German presidency - enlargement of the
EU to take in the countries of east and central Europe - Mr Herzog pointed
out that western Europe would not be able to continue to enjoy its current
levels of wealth and security if east and central Europe remained poor and
insecure.
But he warned that 'adhesion cannot happen from one day to the next. Among
the countries waiting to join, none has yet completely surmounted the
profound crisis brought on by transformation that all of them face.' Last
month France and Germany called upon the Commission to produce a white paper
setting out a plan for enlargement to the east.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Stock market anticipates Kohl victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Growing confidence among investors that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
would be re-elected on Sunday helped the German stock market to make further
gains yesterday after earlier concern that the coalition might lose the
vote.
The DAX index of leading stocks in Frankfurt added a further 2.3 per cent,
or 46.3 points, to reach 2,071 points after a rise of 3.3 per cent (64.2
points) on Monday. Also contributing to the continued upturn was the
stronger performance in the bond market. Despite the positive German stock
market showing, however, some economists still feel Mr Kohl could have an
uphill struggle to win this weekend's general election. 'I think his chances
are slightly better than 50-50,' said Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, Frankfurt-based
economist with UBS Global Research.
This morning, he added, stock market opinion was probably tilting to a 55
per cent probability of a victory for Mr Kohl, whose Christian Democratic
(CDU) governs with the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free
Democrats (FDP); the latter have done badly in recent state elections. Now,
he thought, market opinion in favour of a Kohl success had probably
strengthened to 60 per cent.
In its latest monthly German report, UBS said: 'The chance of a swing to the
left is worrying investors and contributing to a high liquidity preference.'
Recent opinion polls suggesting the governing coalition was likely to win an
outright victory, with the FDP staying in parliament, have helped market
sentiment.
So has confidence about the economic recovery and receding inflation,
despite yesterday's news that west German inflation in September had stuck
at 3 per cent instead of easing to an annual 2.9 per cent as provisionally
stated.
Agreeing that the government was likely to be re-elected, Mr Ulrich Notges,
economist at Trinkaus Capital management, wrote in a pre-election report
that markets had been too blase about the outcome and then swung to
over-pessimism. 'Only since the start of September do opinion polls show
that the coalition has a proper chance of being re-elected.'
A novel opinion survey set up with the help of the Nobel economic prize
winner, Professor Reinhard Selten, says Mr Kohl will win, Wirtschaftswoche
magazine reported, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The economic weekly said its Election Bourse survey, which has 500 real
traders dealing in fictitious stocks linked to the political parties, said
Mr Kohl's coalition would win a tiny majority of seats with 48.6 per cent of
the vote. The survey, for which Prof Selten of Bonn University was an
adviser, had traders buying and selling each party's stocks according to
what they expect the final result to be. Their figures show the combined
opposition getting 47.5 per cent and thus failing to reach an anti-Kohl
majority.
The Social Democrats would get 35 per cent, the Greens 8.2 per cent and the
reformed communist Party of Democratic Socialism 4.3 per cent.
'An election market follows quite different principles from normal opinion
polling,' Wirtschaftswoche quoted Prof Selten as saying. 'How the
participants will vote is not decisive, but rather which result they
expect.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / Cable and Wireless to unveil telecoms project in China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cable and Wireless of the UK will today announce a large telecoms
development project in China which could lead to the opening up of the
world's largest telecoms growth market to foreign operators.
The deal will involve Hongkong Telecom, of which C&amp;W owns a majority stake,
in a joint venture with Chinese partners to expand the country's telecoms
services. Until now, China has maintained a state monopoly over telecoms
services, although western telecoms equipment suppliers have long been
established in the Chinese market.
A leading Hong Kong analyst said the agreement would involve either a
substantial loan from Hongkong Telecom tied to an operating agreement, or a
leasing arrangement, either of which might in time be convertible into an
equity holding.
'This is a watershed, which could lead within months to a far wider opening
up of Chinese telecoms to overseas operators,' he said.
The Cable &amp; Wireless board met in Shanghai on Monday, when the agreement was
finalised. The agreement follows months of intensive contacts between C&amp;W
and China's ministry of posts and telecommunications, during which the
ministry nominated C&amp;W as its 'preferred partner' for future operations.
China has ambitious plans to increase its number of phone lines from about
30m to at least 110m within the next decade. But the ministry is believed to
be finding it increasingly difficult to secure supplier finance for telecoms
expansion, which has obliged the government to move faster than expected on
joint ventures with foreign network operators.
The last significant step in the erosion of the state telecoms monopoly took
place in July, when the state council allowed ministries other than posts
and telecoms to operate telecoms networks.
Three other ministries - railways, electronic industries and electrical
power - launched a new telecoms network backed by leading domestic groups,
which has called on US operators for technical advice.
Earlier this year the operating and regulatory divisions of the MPT were
separated, making it easier for new operators to establish themselves. Lord
Young, C&amp;W chairman, held talks in Beijing in March with telecoms officials
and with Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president. He predicted then that C&amp;W's
first Chinese joint ventures could be agreed by the end of the year.

FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brokers move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance sectors moved into overdrive late in the session as dealers
reacted to continuing takeover speculation plus a more positive view of the
insurance brokers from BZW, a leading light in the sector.
The broking stocks made rapid progress with some dealers still convinced a
predatory move against Willis Corroon could be in the offing. 'If a serious
bid was made for Willis the management would be virtually defenceless,' said
one insurance specialist.
Big blocks of Willis shares have changed hands in recent weeks with PDFM,
one of the UK market's biggest institutions increasing its stake to over 11
per cent and another big buyer said to have been operating. HSBC is seen as
a strong contender for Willis.
Willis shares rose a further 6 to 161p yesterday, after turnover of 1.7m
shares. Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, jumped 8 to 156p on 1m
traded. Much of yesterday's interest was triggered by a positive note from
BZW whose insurance team shifted its long-term stance on the sector from
underweight to neutral with Sedgwick shifted to a 'buy' and Willis from
'sell' to 'hold'.
BZW said it had visited the US operations of Sedgwick, Willis Corroon, and
JIB as well as the big US groups. The broker said it viewed the
underperformance of the sector as 'too severe' and said many stocks now
appear to be suffering punishment ratings. BZW said Sedgwick has a
'sensible' group strategy and is likely to be a winner in an industry which
is likely to be restructured in coming years.
Airports group BAA rose 8 to 504p in 5.1m trades for a two-day gain of 30p
as a stream of favourable air transport news added potential spice to
tomorrow's September traffic figures from the company.
Strong passenger flows from British Midland Airways, air fare cuts on a
number of Far Eastern and trans-Atlantic routes and plans by British Airways
to restart 'open skies' policy talks this month with US airlines all helped
to concentrate market focus on BAA's volume background.
British Airways put on 6 1/2 to 371 1/2 p.
Whitbread rose 13 to 539p, in good trade of 1.2m.
Cider maker HP Bulmer was a particularly strong feature in the drinks
sector. The shares jumped sharply early in the session after details of the
previous three months trading were reported in the market, taking analysts
by surprise.
Calls by some City firms for further information were followed by release of
an official trading statement from the company in the last hour of market
trading. The shares closed 8 ahead at 433p.
The day's single biggest trade was carried out in retailing group House of
Fraser bringing turnover to 25.9m by the close. The shares eased a penny to
207p.
The trade, representing around 5.5 per cent of the company's equity, was
carried out by NatWest Securities below the market price.
Amersham International jumped 17 to 943p as the company announced it had
acquired 20 per cent stake of Nihon MediPhysics, Japan's leading nuclear
medicine group.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conglomerate Hanson stood out as a weak feature among leading
internationally traded stocks which were boosted by a surge in the dollar.
Interest in the shares was said to have been dampened by particularly heavy
selling in New York late on Monday. Dealers said Goldman Sachs the US
investment bank sold two blocks of 750,000 American Depositary Receipts
(ADRs) at Dollars 18 and Dollars 18 1/8 , equivalent to 7.5m shares at
around 228p a share, on behalf of a client. The London traded shares eased
slightly to 228 1/4 p yesterday with 6.5m traded by the close.
Elsewhere, Zeneca remained restrained by the reported attempt of one UK
investment bank to place 2m shares and closed 2 lighter at 805p. However,
pharmaceuticals rival Glaxo jumped 13 to 585 1/2 p as the group announced
that 14.68 per cent of its shares were held in the form of ADRs. The figure
was down from the previously recorded 15.88 per cent but much as expected.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries jumped a further 9 to
450p, its shares helped by takeover speculation in the insurance sector.

<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Persistent talk around the markets that some sort of a deal is in the making
at Cable and Wireless, possibly involving a demerger of the group's Mercury
telecommunications business, was the catalyst for another surge in the
shares.
C &amp; W were the heaviest traded and best performing stock in the FT-SE 100
index, the stock racing up 20 to 415p. Turnover reached 16m shares, the
highest since January. C &amp; W shares touched 538p at the start of the year,
and where trading around 478p in August before plunging to 382p a week ago,
plagued by worries about competition from the likes of BT's Cellnet and
Hutchison's Orange cellular phone networks.
Many analysts said stories of a possible demerger of the Mercury
telecommunications business had been revived and were still wide of the mark
by leading analysts but C &amp; W had expressed deep disappointment with the
market's treatment of its share price.
Dealers noted exceptionally heavy turnover in the shares recently and
pointed to unusually heavy activity in out-of-the-money calls - indicating
high speculative support. They also mentioned keen support from some big
institutions, regarded by traders as having top quality contacts in the
telecoms industry. A number of brokers have been promoting C &amp; W in recent
weeks, notably Hoare Govett who yesterday maintained the shares were still
undervalued.

Composites surged ahead on a mixture of takeover rumours mainly prompted by
talk that Allianz, the German insurance group, may sell its Cornhill
subsidiary and launch a bid for another UK concern. Commercial Union settled
15 ahead at 545p, General Accident 21 to 584p, Guardian 10 1/2 to 195 1/2 p
and Sun Alliance 7 1/2 to 331 1/2 p. Royals added 5 at 294p.
Legal &amp; General, viewed as a prime bid target in life/general insurers, ran
up 11 to 456p. Prudential moved up 9 to 308p. Of the smaller stocks United
Friendly added 2 at 505p, Britannic 10 to 406p and Refuge 8 to 279p.
Aggressive buying of the traded options was said to have been the catalyst
for a 21 surge in Lloyds Abbey Life to 348p.

FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US influences drive shares ahead at
the close - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Excellent trading results from some of the big names in US industry gave a
final boost yesterday to a London stock market already looking confident in
early trading. The FT-SE 100 Share Index closed 40.7 up at 3,073, spurred on
by the December futures contract on the Index which closed comfortably above
3,100.
Institutional buyers came into the equity market towards the close as Wall
Street's opening strength put 40 points on the Dow in UK hours and activated
limit restriction on index-linked trades. The indications of a resurgent US
economy drew further encouragement from firmness in Federal bonds, implying
that inflation worries had not been reawakened ahead of Friday's important
statistics on US industrial production.
London was a little less sure of itself than the gain in the Footsie
suggested. Until Wall Street opened, the gain on the Index was only around
25 points and trading volumes moderate. In the final hour of trading blue
chip stocks swept ahead behind a strong US dollar.
Concerns over inflationary pressures in the UK will be tested this morning
when the announcement of the September retail price index will be followed
by data on average earnings and unit wage costs. Analysts have been
impressed by the rally in UK bonds but remain uncertain over likely trends
in German and US bond markets.
Second line issues were somewhat left behind in the late rise in the stock
market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was content with a gain on the day of 24.1
for a closing reading of 3,506.9. Non-Footsie business made up nearly 58 per
cent of yesterday's total, at the lower end of average daily trading
patterns. Private investors, traditionally active in the second line issues,
have been unwilling to trade in equities in recent months.
The return of Wall Street to fully active trading after the Columbus Day
break, which closed the Federal bond markets, was reflected in a similar
return to normal business levels in London. The Seaq total of 662.3m shares
in London yesterday was around 36 per cent up on the previous session,
although retail business remained satisfactory at Pounds 1.42bn in Monday's
session.
Oil shares, although still firm, continued to respond calmly to events in
the Middle East. The strongest gains came in those UK companies where
profits are most closely linked to the fortunes of the US currency. Glaxo,
HSBC and Unilever were all firm spots. An exception was Cadbury-Schweppes,
upset by news that Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's airline and retail group,
plans to launch a cola drink, in association with a North American group;
Cadbury, jointly with Coca-Cola, produces Coke in the UK market. A generally
favourable reading of the IG Metall union's decision on the impending pay
round benefited UK construction stocks with exposure in Germany.
Consumer stocks showed little nervousness ahead of tomorrow's retail price
statistics, and leading store groups such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Sears made
progress. These sectors have suffered severely in the recent shakeout and
were seen as in line for a rally. However, trading volumes in these shares
was modest yesterday, as institutions preferred the international blue
chips.
The advance on Wall Street was welcomed by those UK analysts who have
pointed to the narrowing of the gap between the New York and London markets
and identified it as a factor favourable to UK equities.
But some pointed to the unwillingness of UK government bond prices to share
in the general advance yesterday, noting that recovery in UK bonds is still
seen as the necessary driving force behind the keenly-awaited upturn in
share prices before the end of this year.

FT  12 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures powered ahead with premiums to the cash market widening
at times to more than 30 points, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract closed 45 points higher at 3,102, moving
above 3,100 for the first time since mid September and extending its rally
to 128 points in four days. At this level, the premium to the cash market
was 29 points against a fair value premium of around 16 points.
Virtually all the day's gains were made from lunchtime onwards, moving ahead
very fast once Wall Street came into the picture showing a strong advance.
Volume, which was a dreary 10,657 on Monday, jumped to 14,793 contracts at
the official 4:10pm close, but traders said there was a marked absence of
genuine business.
The speed and acceleration of the afternoon upswing caught some traders on
the hop and there was talk in the market that a number of short positions
taken in the morning session had been severely squeezed.
Volume in traded options rose strongly, jumping to 43,931 lots from 24,420
on Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for 27,600 lots.
Guinness was the day's most actively traded individual stock option with
2,000 lots dealt followed by British Airways with 1,792 lots.

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities surge stimulated by
solid earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices surged yesterday as solid earnings news brought sharp gains
to stocks across the board, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 55.51 higher at 3,876.83, a little
lower than its session best. The index was held back by the triggering of
NYSE restrictions on program-guided buying. The so-called 'downtick"rule
went into effect at mid-morning, when the Dow pushed past more than 50
points higher than its opening mark.
The rally was broad based, as reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, up
6.75, or 1.5 per cent, at 465.79. On the NYSE, advancing issues were leading
declines by about a three-to-one margin on heavy volume of 355m shares.
The Nasdaq composite also staged a powerful advance, gaining 8.76 to 765.57.
The American SE composite, up 1.78 at 457.76, lagged behind.
It was the third day in a row in which stocks showed marked improvement. The
sustained upturn reflected an easing of concerns over an immediate move by
the Federal Reserve to lift short-term interest rates.
The rally was given added impetus yesterday by a published report, quoting
unnamed Fed officials, which suggested that policy makers would wait until
their next scheduled meeting on November 15 before tightening credit
conditions again.,
The shift in sentiment, which had begun when Friday's employment data proved
to be weaker than expected, was quite evident in the Treasury market, where
bond prices made further progress ahead of this week's inflation news.
Meanwhile, equity investors had a smorgasbord of appealing corporate results
from which to feast. PepsiCo gained Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after
beating the consensus forecast with net earnings of 68 cents a share.
Motorola led the technology sector after revealing impressive quarterly
results after the close of trading the previous session. Its shares were
marked up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 54 with an upgrading by Merrill Lynch
giving the stock added support.
Digital Equipment forged Dollars 1 1/4 ahead to Dollars 29 1/2 on news that
it had sold another of its marginal businesses.
Chrysler was the first of the Big Three car makers to report, but the
response to its announcement was restrained, even though its performance was
better than most had predicted. The issue added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46
5/8 .
International Paper's results were a disappointment, and its stock, down
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 77 1/2 , was one of only two Dow industrial
components to lose ground.
Several other cyclical stocks were up sharply as investors anticipated good
news to come. Caterpillar gained Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 55 1/2 , General
Electric was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 48 1/4 and Deere jumped Dollars 2
3/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 .
There was something more tangible to boost confidence in Procter &amp; Gamble,
up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 62 1/4 . Its chairman told shareholders that the
company had just completed its best quarter ever.
Biogen backtracked a further Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50. The company fell
victim to profit-taking for a second day even though it had revealed that
clinical trials for beta interferon, a multiple sclerosis treatment, were
successful.

industrial stocks.
The overall index fell 72 to 5,526, the industrial 14 to 6,247 and the gold
index lost 91 to 2,265.
Among the main movers De Beers fell R3 to R98, Anglos R6 to R227 and Barlows

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering soars after report
from San Francisco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Easing tensions in the Middle East, optimism for the ruling German coalition
ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections and the unleashing of the Dow
yesterday afternoon coaxed another decidely upbeat performance from German
equities, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT accentuated the positive with bonds rising and, towards the end of
the official session, Dax futures extending Monday's uptrend. The Dax index
rose 46.27, or 2.3 per cent to 2,071.06, effectively doubling Monday's
post-bourse rise to 2,048.56.
In the afternoon, apparently unimpeded by wage demands of up to 6 per cent
from the German engineering workers' union, IG Metall, the Ibis-indicated
Dax climbed further to 2,087.71, up 1.9 per cent over 24 hours.
The stock of the day was Schering, which recovered DM44 to DM942 following
the presentation of rival multiple sclerosis drugs in San Francisco on
Monday. Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs in London, said that Schering's
BetaSeron drug was unlikely to face productive competition until 1996.
In the meantime, said Mr Tracy, Schering was looking at higher margins and
sales, cost cutting potential, net cash equal to around 30 per cent of the
share price and a p/e ratio of 13 to 14 for 1995 backed by prospective
five-year earnings per share growth of 25 per cent per annum compound.
Back in the broad market, there were big gains for Allianz, chemicals and
carmakers. US buying for the latter took Volkswagen up DM11 to DM477, BMW by
DM13.50 to DM791 and Daimler by another DM10.60 to DM789.50 although,
according to the chairman of Adam Opel in Frankfurt, the European and German
car markets will grow only modestly in the next five years and manufacturers
will not match the profits they achieved in the early 1990s.
PARIS finally broke through the 1,900 barrier as the CAC-40 index attained a
session high of 1,924 before easing slightly to close up 20.70 at 1,919.02.
Trading in Sanofi was suspended for a time ahead of its announcement that it
was to sell a significant proportion of its bio-activities to Viag of
Germany for FFr4.4bn. On resumption the shares put on FFr3.10 to close at
FFr241.20.
The sale comes as part of Sanofi's disposal programme to finance the
acquisition of Sterling Winthrop's prescription pharmaceuticals activities
from Eastman Kodak of the US.
Initial reaction from analysts was positive, with the sale price at or above
expectations. However, others remarked that Sanofi still had to dispose of
the remaining part of its bio-activities, worth around FFr2bn, although the
company said that it hoped to sign agreements for the remaining part of the
business by the end of the year.
ZURICH had mixed feelings about its pharmaceuticals and chemicals sector.
Switzerland's three big drug companies are due to produce nine month sales
figures over the next weeks, and the talk yesterday was that Swiss franc
appreciation, and the policy of cost containment by leading customers will
affect the outcome.
Roche certificates recovered SFr95 to SFr5,880 but Sandoz bearers dropped
SFr8 to SFr665, and Ciba bearers by SFr7 to SFr775.
The SMI index rose 16.8, or 0.7 per cent to 2,570.24, led by banks which saw
CS Holding up SFr14 at Sfr544 and SBC bearers SFr6 higher at SFr375. One of
the best gains of the day came from Brown Boveri, up SFr33 at SFr1,100 in a
technical recovery.
MILAN was again rocked by political turmoil as rumours swept the market that
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was about to be placed under
investigation by magistrates. The allegation was firmly denied by a
government spokesperson and the stock market made a late rally on
short-covering.
The Comit index ended the session off 3.23 at 636.83 in light turnover.
Losses among stocks were evenly spread with Montedison off L27 at L1,223 and
Pirelli down L80 at L2,190.
Benetton recovered L230 to L19,900, as the company continued to recoup last
week's losses.
AMSTERDAM's forward momentum continued in moderate turnover. The AEX index
improved 5.23 to 404.11. Philips, which was positive on Monday following
news that it had signed a co-operation agreement with IBM for the production
of semi-conductors, attracted renewed support, the shares rising Fl 1.80 to
Fl 55.00.
MADRID moved from a small decline in mid-session to a minor recovery at the
close, th e general index rising 0.93 to 295.75. Mr Christopher Cooper of
James Capel noted that Monday's turnover had been at, or near a low for the
year of Pta14bn; yesterday produced an improvement at Pta18.7bn.
Banks provided the base for the index improvement with BCH closing Pta35
higher at Pta2,975, Popular up Pta210 at Pta15,660 and Santander Pta70
better at Pta4,970.
STOCKHOLM, and Ericsson Bs were inspired by nine-month figures from the
telecommunications group's US competitor, Motorola. The Ericsson B rise of
SKr21.50, or 6.3 per cent to SKr416 was followed by Volvo B, up SKr4.50 at
SKr138, and the Affarsvarlden General index climbed by 22.80, or 1.6 per
cent to 1,415.00.

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in the dollar
encourages the region's investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in the dollar above the Y100 level encouraged investors, and the
Nikkei index gained ground following Monday's holiday closure on buying of
high-technology stocks by overseas investors and dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 index added 76.71 to 19,821.46 after a low of 19,790.46 and a high
of 19,894.88. The index jumped to the day's high in the morning session on
buying of export-oriented stocks, but fluctuated later in a narrow range.
Expectations of higher US interest rates and growing tensions in the Middle
East supported the dollar while corporate investors, encouraged by the
dollar's advance, also put in buy orders. However, volume was subdued at
199m shares against Friday's 226m.
Traders said the sluggish activity was also partly due to subscriptions to
Japan Tobacco - yesterday was the deadline for the successful bidders to the
share subscription to make payments for their stocks, but some brokers
estimated that 25 per cent to 50 per cent had abstained from buying shares.
The Topix index of all first section stocks finished 5.79 higher at 1,583.84
and the Nikkei 300 rose 1.15 to 290.26. Gainers led losers by 587 to 330,
with 231 issues un-changed.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.01 to 1311.94.
High-technology issues led trading activity: Oki Electric, the day's most
active issue, rose Y13 to Y803, Mitsubishi Electric gained Y6 to Y728 and
Hitachi added Y20 to Y1,010. NEC rose Y30 to Y1,260 and Fujitsu advanced Y30
to Y1,110.
Carmakers, however, were neglected, with Toyota Motor down Y10 to Y2,060 and
Nissan Motor declining Y2 to Y815.
Pulp and paper stocks were higher. Honshu Paper rose Y9 to Y696 and New Oji
Paper added Y20 to Y1,040.
Japan Telecom continued to lose ground, falling Y30,000 to Y3.89m ahead of
the Japan Tobacco listing. However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained

HONG KONG moved forward on bargain hunting although turnover was thin.
The Hang Seng index closed up 113.92 or 1.23 per cent, at 9,362.32 after
touching a high of 9,392.53 in the closing minutes of trade.
Brokers said the buying was mainly led by domestic investors.
Among the day's main movers Jardine Matheson rose HKDollars 2.75, or 4.4 per
cent, to HKDollars 64.75 and HSBC HKDollars 1.25, or 1.4 per cent to
HKDollars 87.50. Brokers said they saw potential for further gains today,
ahead of tomorrow's market holiday and US price data due out by the end of
the week.
SEOUL improved on a rise in blue chips as overall sentiment remained
positive after the government's announcement last week of an easing of
foreign ownership restrictions.
The composite index put on 9.98 to 10,78.66, with an estimated 53.7m shares
traded.
Brokers said that the index reached a new high of 1,083.49 in early trading
before easing slightly on a light round of profit-taking.
Posco closed Won2,300 higher at Won85,700 ahead of a scheduled listing of
its ADRs on the New York stock exchange later this month.

funds following the rally on Wall Street.
The Straits Times Industrial index added 42.95 to 2,345.23, with 188m shares
traded.
US and UK based funds were seen as buyers of blue-chip issues, pushing the
index to an intra-session high of 2,350.1 near the close.

89.77 to 6,124.71, but off a session low of 5,916.39. Turnover was steady at
TDollars 78.45bn.
Financials went against the trend, leaving the sector index up 0.5 per cent,
with ICBC rising TDollars 2 to TDollars 91. Brokers said that they expected
the market to recover gradually in the coming sessions as the impact of
default payments had started to cease and institutions were seen to be
buying.

the big textiles and petrochemicals manufacturer which produced a 146 per
cent increase at net profit level. The BSE 30-share climbed 12.30 to
4,423.25.
The Reliance figures, with a net of Rs5.1bn against market expectations of
about Rs4bn, brought some late enthusiasm into other blue chips.
Reliance itself rose Rs10 to Rs415 after a slight dip ahead of the results.
MANILA could not shake off early weakness on Middle East fears which, with a
new wave of domestic initial public offerings and a lack of fresh company
news, pulled the composite index down 25.16 to 2,946.95 as turnover dropped
from 1.58bn pesos to 1.11bn.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Troubled rouble sinks to new low in Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dramatic decline in the Russian rouble was the highlight of a quiet day on
the foreign exchange markets, writes Philip Coggan.
The rouble followed Monday's 6 per cent fall with a startling 21.5 per cent
plunge, which took the unit from Rs3,081 to Rs3,926 to the dollar.
The Russian central bank responded with its first intervention since
September 22, selling Dollars 80m for roubles. Central bank chairman Viktor
Gerashchenko said the three month refinancing rate was being increased from
130 per cent to 170 per cent with effect from today.
The rouble's fall was a talking point in London, rather than a dealing
issue, since the Russian currency is not traded on international foreign
exchanges.
The US dollar moved in a fairly narrow range, helped by a strong performance
from bonds and equities but weakened by indications of Iraqi troop
withdrawals. The dollar closed in London at Y100.325, down slightly from
Y100.63 on Monday.
Against the D-Mark, the dollar also eased to DM1.5466, from Monday's
DM1.5500. The D-Mark gained some strength from expectations that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl would triumph in Sunday's election. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury
economist at CIBC in London, said the dollar had now traded in the
DM1.54-DM1.55 band for 25 consecutive days.
The sudden decline in the rouble took many people by surprise, with
interbank dealers in Moscow stopping trading. One Russian bank was quoting
the rouble at 5,000 to the dollar to discourage sellers.
'Exactly what triggered the fall is unclear' said Mr Jonathan Hoffman,
international economist at CS First Boston. But Mr Hoffman said the rouble
appreciated sharply in real terms during 1993. 'Our judgment on policy is
that the Russian authorities wanted to reverse some - but not all - of this
in order to help exporting industries.'
Since September 22, in Mr Hoffman's view, the authorities have followed a
policy of benign neglect of the exchange rate. Previous announcements that
they would not raise rates to support the rouble may have weakened the
currency but yesterday's U-turn would help the currency, he thought.
Mr Hoffman does not think the rouble will go into a further tailspin and
believes it can stabilise at around Rs5,000/Dollars by the end of the year.
However, Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said 'In
this sort of circumstance, the market is trading on fear and emotion. In the
absence of an improvement in confidence over economic management and
political leadership, there's no level beyond which the rouble can't
depreciate.'
In the crisis atmosphere, a spokeswoman for the central bank was reported as
saying that the peak of speculation against the rouble was past and
speculators risked heavy losses if they made further attacks. 'The situation
is under control and we have enough reserves to control it' she said.
Sterling was generally weaker ahead of today's batch of important economic
data. The pound fell against the dollar to close in London at Dollars 1.5815
from Monday's close of Dollars 1.5852, while against the D-Mark, it weakened
to DM2.4459 from DM2.4569.
Today will see inflation and average earnings numbers, which will be
scrutinised closely for signs that the government will need to increase
interest rates again. Consensus forecasts suggest the figures will show that
inflationary pressures will remain subdued.
However, Mr Parsons of CIBC, warns that history suggests the pound's short
term outlook is not good. 'For the last eight years, sterling has fallen in
the week of the Conservative party conference on all but one occasion' he
says.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO Bank, argues that the
longer term outlook for sterling is encouraging. He believes the big falls
in UK financial markets this year have built in a risk premium to sterling
assets, which should provide some underlying support for the pound.
In the money markets, the Bank of England gave assistance in two batches of
Pounds 126m and Pounds 485m, in response to a Pounds 650m shortage, revised
from an earlier forecast of Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved within the
range of 6 1/2 to 4 3/4 per cent.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zambia seeks partner to develop
copper mine - Outright privatisation of the giant Konkola deposit is ruled
out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Zambia is likely to hive off the massive ore body of
Konkola from the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines in an attempt to
attract foreign loan or equity capital to develop the Dollars 600m project.
President Frederick Chiluba acknowledged in an interview that private
investment was urgently required to reverse the ailing fortunes of Zambia's
copper industry, which remains the fulcrum of the economy. Since
nationalisation, copper production has nosedived from a peak of 700,000
tonnes a year in the mid-1970s to below 400,000 tonnes. Output is forecast
to halve again by the turn of the century unless the Konkola Deep deposit,
with mineral resources of 381m tonnes containing 3.5 per cent copper, can be
brought into operation before ZCCM's existing mines are exhausted.
'New projects, such as Konkola, should be able to attract private investment
on their own,' President Chiluba said. To make the project more attractive
to foreign investors, he said Konkola might be run as a subsidiary of ZCCM,
free from the parent company's financial constraints.
President Chiluba's plan, however, stops short of outright privatisation.
Both he and ZCCM's management are searching for formulas that would keep
Konkola under state control.
'Konkola is the jewel in our crown,' says Mr Edward Shamutete, ZCCM's chief
executive. 'If we privatise Konkola the rest of ZCCM is a dead duck.'
The government has already turned down an offer by Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa to lead a consortium that would develop Konkola
as an independent joint-venture - relegating ZCCM to a minority role. Anglo
American is disappointed. As ZCCM's main minority shareholder, having
retained a 27 per cent stake in the company following nationalisation, the
South African mining house is as anxious as the government to get Konkola
off to an early start.
Mr Shamutete believes ZCCM could raise the Dollars 600m required to develop
Konkola if the government were to lighten the company's Dollars 740m debt
burden by absorbing Dollars 220m owed to the Paris Club of creditor nations.
Earlier this year, the ZCCM board appointed Nikko Securities of Japan to put
together a loan package for Konkola. But few believe Nikko will be
successful.
ZCCM's chief executive knows that he is in a race against time.
In the meantime, his own investment budget is shrinking. Low copper prices
drove ZCCM's operations into the red last year, with the company posting
losses of Dollars 135m in the six months to March 1994. A short-term
recovery plan, which includes slashing ZCCM's investment budget from Dollars
150m to Dollars 105m this year and making redundant 10,000 miners -
one-fifth of the workforce - is behind schedule. Mr Shamutete admits that by
September production of finished copper was still 7 per cent below target
and that efforts to lower production costs had only met with partial
success.
His aim is to transform ZCCM into an efficient, low-cost producer ahead of
privatisation, which remains the government's stated goal. When and how
privatisation will take place is less certain.
The cabinet last week rejected a report by German consultants that
recommended the carve up of ZCCM into five units for privatisation.
Not surprisingly, both Anglo American and ZCCM's management were also
opposed to the options outlined by Kienbaum Development Services, the German
consultants. Mr Anderson Mazoka, Anglo American's managing director in
Lusaka, believes the company would be better managed as a single unit under
one group of shareholders. 'The break up of ZCCM would lead to the rapid
closure of the less profitable divisions,' he says. He believes the
negotiations to sell off separate units would be long and costly and would
open up opportunities for corruption.
Few doubt that if ZCCM were to be privatised as a single unit Anglo American
would become the controlling shareholder - an option which is also
politically unacceptable to the government, as it would place the country's
entire copper wealth, and the source of 90 per cent of Zambia's export
earnings, in the hands of one multinational.
President Chiluba says he plans to commission another study into ZCCM's
options for privatisation. He admits that the sheer complexity of the
exercise as well as the absence of a national consensus on the issue make it
unlikely that ZCCM will be privatised during his present term of office,
which ends in 1996.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME urged to tighten its rules
after Chilean losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A call for the London Metal Exchange to introduce more stringent rules was
made last night by Mr Juan Villarzu, president of Codelco, the state-owned
Chilean copper group that last year lost about USDollars 200m on metals
trading.
Using the LME's annual dinner to launch his appeal, Mr Villarzu expressed
particular concern about the exchange's system of 'carries at historical
prices'. He said: 'Had you the opportunity to examine the trading contracts
which Codelco entered into during 1993, you would have been amazed at the
number of transactions whose prices had no direct relationship with the
market prices ruling at the date and time of the transaction.'
He suggested that the LME's most valuable asset - its credibility - was
possibly being jeopardised by 'the abuse of certain practices which came to
our attention while examining our last year's futures trading'.
Mr Villarzu also called for producers and consumers to be given a bigger
share in the running of the LME.
Replying immediately, Mr Raj Bagri, the LME chairman, said that if any
member had misused the historical price carries system 'we will not hesitate
to take appropriate action'. However, market users could not be absolved
from their responsibilities. 'Failure of controls, supervision or systems at
their end will not be an acceptable excuse for aiding and abetting any
misuse of our markets by their staff or management,' he declared.
Mr Bagri pointed out that the breakneck speed at which derivatives and
futures trading had taken root and spread across the full spectrum of
financial and commodity markets 'has in many instances left managements far
behind in having in place adequate, effective and timely supervisory
measures to monitor and control risks'.
Nevertheless, the LME hoped to have in place by early next year measures 'to
limit any perceived dangers of historical price carries'.
Mr Bagri said where heavy losses had been suffered from its derivative and
futures trading, the LME had responded constructively to requests for
co-operation from any properly constituted organisation investigating those
losses.

FT  12 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Gold price finds support after
hitting six-week low - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The GOLD price dipped to the lowest level since the end of August at the
London bullion market yesterday before struggling back up a little in what
one dealer described as 'a bit of a dead cat bounce'.
'But at least it seemed to have found a level and may even be trying to
break through on the upside,' he added as the price closed at Dollars 388.25
a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.25 on the day and Dollars 4.45 on the week so
far, but Dollars 2.75 above its lunchtime low.
Bullion's shaky morning was prompted by a lacklustre performance on Monday
and Australian producer and commission house selling finding the market
long, dealers said.
They added that disillusionment had set in for the longs after the price
failed to get through Dollars 400 an ounce when apparently well primed two
weeks ago and to a lesser extent last week.
'It may pick up from here,' one suggested. 'It needed this to clear out the
tired longs.'
London Metal Exchange COPPER prices staged a sharp mid-afternoon rally after
hearing that the cheapest offer to the US Mint at its tender yesterday was
Dollars 2,575 a tonne, confirming that high premiums ruled in the US market,
dealers said.
Short-covering and speculative buying saw the three moths price climb from
an early low of Dollars 2,464 a tonne to close at Dollars 2,486, still down
on its earlier high of Dollars 2,506 and Dollars Dollars 5.50 below Monday's
close.
Dealers said copper earlier fell under speculative and stop-loss selling but
appeared to find support below its medium term trendline at Dollars 2,470.
They noted that a big fall in LME stocks had been reported in the morning as
metal continued to be shipped from Europe to the premium US market.
At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures shrugged off an early plunge
to end the day significantly higher, helped by a short-covering rally and
increased roaster buying. At the close the January position was quoted at
Dollars 3,533 a tonne, Dollars 87 up on the day and Dollars 183 above the
morning low.
The early fall was prompted by a weak close on Monday in New York. But
traders said that they then noticed increased roaster and trade buying.
'Being a lot cheaper, they will be a lot more comfortable buying at these
levels,' one explained.
OIL prices moved in a fairly narrow range as uncertainty about the
implications of the Gulf crisis for future supply led dealers to adopt a
cautious stance.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exchange awakens to attractions
of non-trade investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Metal Exchange once was hostile to fund and other non-trade
activity in its markets, said Mr David King, the exchange's chief executive,
yesterday, but now welcomed this business because it enhanced liquidity and
reduced volatility.
However, although fund activity on the LME had grown significantly in the
past few months, it was not nearly as large as occasionally portrayed in the
media and represented less than 5 per cent of the exchange's turnover.
Funds were attracted to the LME by the apparent potential for metals price
rises based on genuine fundamentals. Also 'the LME now has a very deep,
liquid market compared with the size of market it had at the time of the
last (economic) recovery, and financial engineering and rocket scientist
technology which was now widely available - and all the ingredients were
there for funds, in various guises, indices, warrants and other products, to
move in and create positions in LME's market'.
The LME's turnover had increased sixfold in six years to 35.3m 'lots' in
1993, equivalent to 800m tonnes of metal valued at USDollars 1,000bn, he
pointed out at a conference organised by Metal Bulletin. In 1994 turnover
would increase by another 35 per cent to about 45m lots, or nearly Dollars
2,000bn.
LME users needed to adjust in future to a new 'fundamental' in LME price
discovery, said Mr King. 'Along with supply/demand levels, rock blasts,
miners' strikes and LME stock levels there must be added the fundamental of
non-trade activity - the movement of funds into or out of LME markets,
driven by their own trading strategies or chart points, causing with their
movement, a movement in LME prices.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Multinational companies find success in
eurodollar sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three leading multinational companies - Bayer, SmithKline Beecham and Toyota
 -yesterday successfully completed eurodollar issues, while deals by two
frequent European borrowers, including the first 20-year peseta-denominated
issue, also caught the eye of traders.
Toyota Motor Finance (Netherlands), a financing subsidiary of the Japanese
motor concern, and Bayer USA, part of the German drugs and chemical group,
successfully placed dollar-denominated paper.
The three-year Toyota paper, led by CS First Boston, was sold at a fixed
re-offer price of 99.75, yielding 20 basis points over the corresponding US
Treasury bond, and raising a total of Dollars 200m.
The re-offer price on the five-year Bayer paper was 99.479, yielding 42
basis points over Treasuries. Deutsche Bank led the issue which raised
Dollars 300m.
*something in here (HP) *
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group, raised Dollars
200m with three-year paper carrying a coupon of 7 3/8 per cent.
The issue was priced at 99.85, but fell to close at 99.70 after the bonds
were freed to trade, with the yield spread widening from 37 1/2 basis points
to 42 over the US Treasury bond.
Lead manager SG Warburg said that the decision by Standard &amp; Poor's, the
credit rating agency, to downgrade the company last month - and the fact
that it now has a 'split rating' - had discouraged some investors.
SmithKline raised the money as part of its financing programme for a series
of recent acquisitions, including the Dollars 1.9bn purchase of Sterling
Winthrop.
Proceeds were immediately swapped into floating-rate funds and used to
refinance bank debt, according to Warburg.
Eurofima, the Swiss-based group which funds the purchase of railway rolling
stock, raised Pta20bn, passing on the proceeds to Renfe, the Spanish railway
operator.
The deal followed a Pta20bn floating-rate note by the European Investment
Bank last week but was the first matador bond to be issued for some months
and the first ever to carry a 20-year maturity.
Both its term and 11 per cent coupon appealed to Spanish life assurance
companies and pension funds, lead manager Banco Bilbao Vizcaya explained.
The European Investment Bank was also back in the markets yesterday, raising
L400bn, fungible with a L1,400bn deal launched in June.
JP Morgan, together with three Italian banks, led the deal, which was priced
at 97.995 with a 10.15 per cent coupon. Morgan said demand was particularly
strong in Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as in Italy.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries forge ahead as rate rise fears
recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds forged ahead yesterday as fears of an immediate increase
in short-term interest rates dissipated.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 higher
at 95 27/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.856 per cent and the two-year
note was  1/16 better at 99 27/32 , to yield 6.601 per cent.
Bonds opened with solid gains and advanced steadily until late afternoon,
when prices receded from their best levels of the day. The positive tone in
part reflected technical conditions created by the extreme bearishness that
had preceded Friday's mild employment data.
With yesterday's activity, the tentative upturn which had begun at the end
of last week turned into a fully-fledged rally, though trading volume was
not heavy.
The extra impetus came from a report in The New York Times which further
dispelled concern among traders that the Federal Reserve would lift rates at
the end of this week. The story quoted unnamed Fed officials as saying it
would need to see more data before deciding when to tighten policy again.
The suggestion was that policy makers would probably wait until their next
meeting on November 15 before considering a move.
Such signals gave the market a little breathing ahead of the barrage of
important economic figures to be released later in the week. Traders were
already setting up positions in anticipation of Thursday's reading on
September producer prices, which were expected to show a slight 0.1 per cent
gain.
Friday will bring news of inflation on the consumer level. The consensus
forecast projected a 0.2 per cent gain during the month.
There was an undercurrent of unease yesterday that the market was becoming
too confident.
Some traders said prices could tumble if the figures on the current level of
inflation came in stronger than expected, or if Friday's industrial
production data suggested price pressures were building in the economy.
European government bond markets took their cue from the US yesterday, and
adopted a generally firmer tone. However, there was little trading ahead of
key data due tomorrow from the US and the German election on Sunday.
German bunds drifted, lifting slightly during the course of the day. Mr
Christoph Anhamm at UBS in Frankfurt said: 'It is a futures-driven market.'
He believes there may be a rally on Monday, after the result of the German
election on Sunday, which he expects Chancellor Helmut Kohl to win.
He pointed out that the yield on the benchmark 10-year bund fell by 21 basis
points after the election in 1983, and by around 12 basis points after the
election in 1990. He believes there is scope for the 10-year yield to fall
by 15 to 20 basis points on Monday.
The December bund future was around 89.40 in late trading, up 0.34 points on
the day.
UK gilts rose slightly, following German bunds. Volumes were thin however,
before today's important data on UK retail prices, employment and earnings.
Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said gilts had taken their tone from
bunds and if bunds were to rise on Monday after the German election result,
gilts would be likely to rise in their wake.
He said: 'Bunds seem to have come to the conclusion that Chancellor Kohl
will win, and I would say that was likely. However there is enough
uncertainty around for the market to go up on Monday morning if Kohl wins.'
The December gilt future on Liffe rose  3/32 on the day to 100 21/32 in late
trading. The yield spread over bunds widened slightly to around 130 basis
points in late trading.
The Pounds 650m of stock issued yesterday by the Bank of England was sold
around market prices. The stock was in three tranches: Pounds 250m of 6 per
cent due 1999, Pounds 250m of 8 per cent due 2009, and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2
per cent index-linked due 2024.
The Italian market bucked the European trend to register a fall on domestic
news. Mr Andre de Silva of PaineWebber said the sell-off was sparked by
reports that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was to be directly
investigated and that discussions on cutting the budget deficit by reducing
pension provisions had been suspended. He said: 'This reflects the high risk
attached to Italian assets.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Mary Schapiro takes CFTC helm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Mary Schapiro will take the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission this week, giving the agency a permanent chief for the first time
in nearly two years.
Her confirmation as the chief US derivatives regulator came last week, after
being delayed for four months by a political dispute between Mr Jesse Helms,
the powerful southern senator, and Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture
secretary.
Although the 38-year-old Ms Schapiro kept a low profile during the dispute,
both she and powerful people from the industry she will regulate have been
anxious for her to start work. The CFTC has been without permanent
leadership when financial regulators have been re-examining their treatment
of derivatives, with the agency at best playing a consultative or catch-up
role.
Having suffered for years from an image as a toothless watchdog with
questionably cosy relationships with its industry, the CFTC's stature and
its staff morale were further damaged by the low priority the administration
gave to filling the chair. Now the agency's traditional constituency, the US
futures exchanges, fear the CFTC's lack of status will put them at a
disadvantage as global rules on derivatives trading are forged.
In her new post, Ms Schapiro has oversight of private derivatives markets as
well as established futures exchanges. She will also become part of the
president's working group on financial markets, which for the past year has
been focusing on non-listed derivatives.
Since 1988 she has served as a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a regulatory agency that dwarfs the CFTC in terms of budget,
staff and mandate. Asked about the perception that the SEC's competency far
out-shines the CFTC, Ms Schapiro said: 'I don't want to compare the agencies
 -it wouldn't be fair. I'd just like to say that the SEC is as fine an
agency as I'd ever like to work in, public or private, and I'd like to bring
the SEC's tradition as a fair, strong and tough regulator with me to the
CFTC.'
Ms Schapiro says one of her first actions will be to look at the CFTC's
structure. 'The agency isn't growing, but its mandate and the markets it
supervises are. Realistically, I have to find a better way to do the job
with the resources we have.' The CFTC's 1995 budget is Dollars 50m, compared
with the SEC's Dollars 300m.
The CFTC has been criticised for neglecting its enforcement duties while
devoting too much energy to desk work.
Ms Schapiro, who started her career as a CFTC enforcement attorney, says she
wants to change that image. 'I don't believe you can have an effective
regulatory agency without an effective enforcement division. It doesn't
matter how good your rules are if you can't enforce them,' she said.
The agency must also ask Congress for reauthorisation this year. 'I'm hoping
very much that this reauthorisation will not absorb all the agency's time
and energy. My goal is to get the agency reauthorised quickly,' Ms Schapiro
says.
Although Ms Schapiro's nomination last May was widely praised by executives
at US futures exchanges, her extensive knowledge of the industry may over
time prove perplexing to them. She will be the first experienced regulator
with extensive derivatives knowledge to head the CFTC in more than a decade.

on its programme of upgrading processing plants and paper-making machines,
writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. Most of the new investments, part of
annual development spending totalling almost SKr3.5bn, will go on a new wood
processing facility at Gruvon in Sweden. The others include rebuilding a
paper machine at Uetersen in Germany.
The investments will not add to Stora's overall capacity; a decision is not

Kleinwort Benson, the UK-based merchant bank, received a boost yesterday
from Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, which said it
had raised the rating on the bank's long-term deposits to A3 from Baa1,
writes Norma Cohen in London.
Moody's said the upgrade reflected a significant improvement in the bank's
internal controls since heavy losses reported in 1990, and its decision to
shed its unprofitable commercial lending activities. A strong performance in
securities markets and high volumes of new issues in subsequent years had
helped Kleinwort bolster its loan loss provisions.
The bank has also benefited from its growing asset management business and
its ability to retain its franchise in the corporate advisory markets, the
agency said.

Dassault Aviation, the French maker of fighter and business-jet aircraft,

Buchan in Paris.
Dassault, which is 70 per cent dependent on military sales, was badly hit in
the early 1990s by the slowdown in French defence orders, heavy development
costs for the Rafale fighter and a dearth of export orders. However, it
recently capped a 1992 contract to supply 60 Mirage fighters to Taiwan with
a deal to sell Qatar a dozen Mirages in return for taking some old ones

A sharp rise in advertising revenue helped Gannett, the US media group, to a
19 per cent increase in third-quarter net income to Dollars 105.5m, writes
Tony Jackson in New York.
Gannett, which publishes 83 daily papers, including USA Today, said growth
in newspaper profits was fuelled by recruitment advertising.
Newspaper advertising revenue was up 10 per cent in the quarter to Dollars
521.9m, with classified advertising contributing a rise of 14 per cent and
USA Today a rise of 11 per cent. Circulation revenue rose 2 per cent, and
newspaper profits overall were up 10 per cent at Dollars 167.7m on sales of
Dollars 771.3m.
Broadcasting profits were up 48 per cent at Dollars 27.2m on revenues of
Dollars 95.2m. Gannett, which owns nine TV stations and 11 radio stations,
said TV revenues were up 16 per cent and radio revenues up 15 per cent.
Profits from outdoor advertising were up 25 per cent to Dollars 7.0m, on
strong local and national demand. Gannett is the biggest outdoor advertising
company in the US.
Group sales in the quarter were up 6 per cent at Dollars 932.4m.
Earnings per share were up 21 per cent to a record 74 cents. The dividend
was raised to 34 cents from 33 cents. Media General, which owns newspapers
and TV stations in the south-eastern US, said net earnings rose 57 per cent
in the third quarter to Dollars 8.0m, on sales up 5 per cent at Dollars

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Siemens' dream factory in
Singapore - The island republic is the base for German group's sales in
Asia-Pacific region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hartmut Lueck, managing director of the Siemens semiconductor plant in
Singapore, has the sort of problem many of the world's industrialists dream
about. His factory is working round the clock, every day of the year, yet it
still cannot produce enough to satisfy demand.
'A few years ago neither Siemens nor anyone else realised how big the demand
for semiconductors would be,' says Mr Lueck. 'Take the use of semiconductors
in mobile phones. When mobile phones first appeared we thought they would be
used mainly by businesspeople and professionals. Now - in this region at
least - they have virtually become a piece of costume jewellery.'
Siemens first established an electronics factory in Singapore in 1970. Now
it employs 1,600 people at a new components plant capable of turning out
more than 300m semi-conductors a year. Singapore serves as the base for
Siemens' components sales in the Asia Pacific region.
Like many other companies, Siemens is increasingly focusing on the region as
the area of future large-scale sales growth. Later this month the entire
board will be flying to Singapore for the first board meeting to be held
outside Germany in the company's 147-year history.
For Siemens as a whole, the Asia-Pacific countries - stretching from
Pakistan to Australia - represent one of the world's most promising growth
regions. The group's business there has been growing at double-digit
percentage rates and is expected in a few years to be as large as that in
the US, accounting for some 15 per cent of turnover.
As a provider of complete energy, transport and tele-communications systems,
Siemens aims to play an expanding role in the economic growth of Asia.
The group's order volume in east and south-east Asia rose by 50 per cent to
DM5.4bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in the financial year to end-September 1993;
worldwide orders totalled DM84bn. In its last annual report, the group
described south-east Asia as 'an extraordinarily dynamic' electrical and
electronics market.
In volume terms, Siemens does not compete with the world's biggest
semiconductors manufacturers such as NEC of Japan and Intel of the US. But
with the world chip market forecast to grow by between 50 per cent and 100
per cent by the end of the decade, Siemens Singapore is confident that
business will continue to expand.
Last year sales from Siemens Singapore operations reached nearly DM800m  - a
rise of more than 50 per cent on the 1992 figure.
This year sales have already exceeded DM1bn, fuelled by growth in the
region's telecommunications industry, particularly in China.
Mr Lueck feels his company has some advantages over competitors. Siemens
started its Singapore factory in the 1970s, in order to benefit from the
island republic's low wages.
'Though wages have risen here, they are still low compared with Germany or
the US and are an important factor in our operations,' says Mr Lueck. 'But
the character of the semiconductor industry is changing. Now cost is not so
crucial. The most important thing is innovation and being first - then you
make your own price. You can also then achieve cost advantages through
volume and quickly recoup your costs - in order to invest in the next cycle
of the industry.'
Accumulated investment in Singapore by Siemens is put at DM450m. Siemens
also has two other regional plants, both in neighbouring Malaysia, which
together employ nearly 4,000 people. 'It's very important to be based in the
region you are selling to,' says Mr Lueck.
There are other advantages. Aided by a Singapore government grant, Siemens
is opening an integrated circuit design centre linked to a similar facility
at headquarters in Munich. When Munich sleeps, the design centre can take
over.
Technological advances in the semiconductor industry are rapid: every three
or four years a new generation of chips comes along which is far more
powerful than its predecessor. 'By working round the clock the R&amp;D and
innovation cycles are shortened,' says Mr Lueck. 'That's vital for remaining
competitive.'
The wafers from which the chips are cut are flown in from Europe. Finished
chips used to go back to Germany for testing, but now that is done in
Singapore and Malaysia.
Siemens Singapore does have its problems. Labour shortages and job-hopping
are top of the list. About 30 per cent of the workers at the Singapore plant
travel each day from Malaysia. For its top engineers Siemens has had to hold
recruitment drives in the US and elsewhere to lure talented Singaporeans
back home.
Though the semiconductor market is buoyant, Mr Lueck says the industry is
unpredictable. 'It's a yo-yo industry - almost overnight you can go from
chronic shortages to overcapacity. You always have to be flexible and ready
to adapt to change.
'But in this region at least the trend seem to be on an upward curve, with
sales likely to rise by between 18 and 20 per cent each year. For the time
being it's not too bad.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Siemens has reached the break-even level in its semi- conductor operations a
year ahead of schedule as a result of the improved economic situation in
Europe and its own cost-cutting programme, writes Andrew Fisher in
Frankfurt. These activities have previously involved the group in heavy
losses and restructuring costs.
Mr Jurgen Knorr, director of the semiconductor division, called this 'a very
good result' with new orders exceeding DM3bn (Dollars 1.9bn) in the year to
September 30 1994, after DM2.6bn the previous year. He said the outlook for
1994-95 was very positive. Siemens expected to match growth in the
semiconductor market, likely to be between 13 and 15 per cent.
In south-east Asia and the US, the computer chip market should grow at twice
this rate, he added. Investments in both areas would be increased, with a
wafer plant in south-east Asia a possibility; Siemens currently makes wafers
(used in semiconductor production) in Germany, France and Austria. Mr Knorr
said the world semiconductor market should total about Dollars 77bn this
year and nearly Dollars 100bn next year.
He said memory chips were the biggest part of Siemens' semiconductor
business, with application specific chips close behind; each accounted for
about DM1bn of turnover.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: News Corp to modify status of
new shares

<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has bowed to investor pressure and
agreed to modify its plan for a one-for-two issue of limited voting
preference shares.
News directors announced yesterday that the international media company
would proceed with the issue but make two important alterations to the
status of the proposed new shares. The changes, to be put to shareholders by
January 1995, provide that:
The new preference shares would receive a dividend premium of at least 20
per cent over the company's ordinary shares.
The new shares would participate, on the same basis as ordinary shares, in
any takeover bid for the company.
Directors said the changes would be inserted in the company's articles of
association, and followed consideration of comments from the investment
community since the preference share issue was announced on September 30.
They pointed out that the new preference shares would carry an annual
dividend of 7.5 Australian cents, and the proposed 20 per cent premium would
therefore not take effect until the ordinary dividend reached 6.25 cents a
share.
There was 'no present intention' of increasing the 3 cents-a-share annual
dividend for ordinary shares.
The proposed new articles will also build in a protection if any takeover
failed to include the new preference shares. In this event, any ordinary
shares acquired would automatically convert to preferred limited voting
ordinary shares.
The alterations help to address the main concerns of News' institutional
shareholders, some of whom perceived the new issue as a way for Mr Murdoch
to entrench his control over the company. Others were more concerned that
the preference issue might preface a large acquisition with consequent
dilution of News earnings.
News shares slid following the preference issue announcement last month,
hitting a low of ADollars 7.72 on Australian stock exchanges, before
recovering yesterday to close at ADollars 8.27.
The initial price fall served as a warning that the proposed new preference
shares could trade at a significant discount to the ordinaries, threatening
to limit the size of future capital raisings by News.
By guaranteeing a higher dividend and allowing the new shares to participate
in any control premium for the company, News directors have provided
encouragement for the preference shares to be priced closer to their
ordinary counterparts, in spite of their non-voting status.

above forecasts

<TEXT>
Apple Computer expects revenues and earnings for its fourth quarter to be
significantly higher than current Wall Street estimates.
The US personal computer company, which plans to release results for the
year ending September 30 next week, said it expected revenues for the fourth
quarter to be around Dollars 2.5bn, up from Dollars 2.1bn in the same period
last year.
Earnings per share would be 'slightly above 90 cents a share', the company
said. This compares with Wall Street estimates of about 65 cents to 70
cents. Apple's net income was Dollars 2.7m, or 2 cents a share, for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1993.
The company's share price rose to a 14-month high to close at Dollars 39 5/8
yesterday.
The shares have gained 10 per cent since last Thursday's close of Dollars 36
1/4 amid rumours of an impending agreement with International Business
Machines to establish a common standard for the design of PowerPC-based
personal computers.
Apple uses the PowerPC microprocessor in its latest Power Macintosh
computers. There has also been widespread speculation that IBM might take a
minority stake in Apple to cement such an agreement.
Apple said that demand was strong in the fourth quarter for its entry-level
PCs, Power Macintosh models based on the PowerPC chip and its PowerBook
notebook computers.
The company said it expected gross margins as a percentage of net sales for
the fourth quarter to be slightly above the 26.7 per cent it reported in its
third fiscal quarter. Operating expenses would be slightly less than 20 per
cent of net sales, it added.

Mr Engen, 50, will take on responsibility for the group's insurance

January. With the three manufacturing divisions he already runs, he will be
in charge of businesses generating three-quarters of ITT's Dollars 22bn

Mr Engen takes on his new responsibilities from Mr Dale Comey, who is to
retire at the age of 52. ITT said there was 'nothing sinister' in Mr Comey's
departure. He simply wanted to retire early.

jump 50%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Worldwide demand for cellular telephones helped to boost Motorola's sales
and earnings to record levels for the third quarter and year to date.
The US communications, electronics and semiconductor group lifted
third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 380m, up almost 50 per cent from
Dollars 254m. Earnings per share jumped to 65 cents from 44 cents. Revenues
rose 28 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 4.4bn in the same period last
year.
Motorola's largest businesses - wireless communications and semiconductors -
saw revenues grow strongly. Sales of cellular telephone equipment advanced
63 per cent toDollars 2.2bn.
Motorola was awarded contracts during the third quarter for digital cellular
systems to be built in Moscow, Hong Kong and Nigeria. Contracts for analog
cellular systems came from the Philippines and several countries in Africa.
Other parts of Motorola's wireless communications business - including
two-way radios, pagers and wireless data communications for mobile computer
users - together accounted for Dollars 1.5bn in revenues, up 23 per cent on
the same period last year.
Semiconductor sales rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, continuing an
uninterrupted record of more than five years' growth.
For the first nine months sales reached Dollars 15.8bn, up 32 per cent from
Dollars 12bn a year ago. Net earnings were Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 1.79 a
share, compared with Dollars 682m, or Dollars 1.20. The 1993 per-share
figures were restated for a 2-for-1 stock split in April.

Shares in Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, jumped Dollars 2
1/2 to Dollars 62 3/8 yesterday after Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief
executive, predicted it would report record sales and earnings for its first
quarter to September.
Unit volume for the quarter was 10 per cent higher than a year earlier, Mr
Artzt told the company's annual meeting, with 3 percentage points of the
increase coming from new businesses.
Mr Artzt said Procter &amp; Gamble could increase its share of the Dollars 25bn
worldwide laundry products market from 23 per cent to 33 per cent by the end
of the decade.
This is likely to raise eyebrows at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group which is
P&amp;G's biggest rival. The companies are embroiled in an acrimonious soap war
over the European laundry products market.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Intel seeks to stop shipments of
AMD chips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Intel is seeking an injunction to force rival Advanced Micro Devices to halt
shipments of microprocessor chips, following a US court ruling that a small
element of the 'microcode' contained in AMD's 486 microprocessors infringes
Intel copyright.
Intel said AMD must immediately stop making and selling the chips, which are
used in personal computers. AMD, however, said that in anticipation of an
injunction it had already begun production this week of chips with the
infringing microcode expunged. It said it did not expect any disruption to
shipments of its 486 microprocessors to PC manufacturers.
'This litigation is simply another effort by Intel to limit competition in
the 486 microprocessor market,' said Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and
chief executive officer. 'It must not succeed.'
The copyright dispute is the latest development in almost a decade of legal
battles between Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and AMD, its former
technology partner. AMD sells microprocessors that emulate Intel's designs.
The copyright infringement ruling covers a very small portion of a
microprocessor microcode used for in-circuit emulation, or debugging of
software. AMD said the code was 'superfluous'.
The ruling applies only to this portion of microcode and 'does not affect
jury verdicts returned earlier this year upholding AMD's right to
manufacture and sell microchips containing Intel microcode', AMD said.
Intel charged, however, that AMD had deliberately used Intel microcode.
Being 'compatible with Intel technology was so critical to AMD's strategy
that AMD copied the ICE code, after it had specifically given up any rights
to do so', said Mr F. Thomas Dunlap, Intel vice-president and general
counsel.
AMD will ask the court for 'reasonable time to change our production lines',
said Mr Sanders. The production cycle for microprocessors is about 12 weeks,
so it will be several weeks before the new chips are available. AMD will
also have to destroy up to 100,000 chips that it has in inventory, Mr
Sanders said.
AMD expects to ship between 1m and 1.2m microprocessors in the current
quarter. 'While we are not giving up our rights to appeal, we are looking at
the decision as final,' said Mr Sanders.

PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast-food company, brought cheer to its
shareholders yesterday with quarterly figures suggesting it was fighting off
the threat to its core Pepsi-Cola brand from own-label cola drinks.
The news from its fast-food restaurant businesses, however, was less
encouraging.
Overall, net income for the third quarter to September 3 was Dollars 541.4m.
This was 18 per cent higher than the comparable quarter's Dollars 458.2m -
although excluding a tax adjustment in the prior year, growth would have
been a less impressive 11 per cent.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn and earnings per share, boosted
by company share repurchases, rose to 68 cents from 56 cents.
For the nine months, underlying profits (excluding unusual charges) were 7
per cent ahead at Dollars 1.3bn.

After-tax earnings at CPC International, the US-based food group that makes
Hellmann's mayonnaise, Knorr soups and Mazola corn oil, edged ahead 3 per
cent to Dollars 125.4m in the third quarter.
The main factors hindering profits growth were difficult economic conditions
in Brazil, which affected the group's Latin American consumer food earnings,
and flat operating income at Best Foods, CPC's North American consumer food
business.
World-wide sales advanced by 9 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, with CPC
attributing the rise to acquisitions in North America and Europe, a strong
performance from its Asian consumer food operations, and good results from
the corn refining business.
Worldwide operating income rose by 5 per cent, but higher financing charges
limited growth to 4 per cent at the pre-tax level.
Earnings per share rose from 79 cents to 83 cents.

<TEXT>
The US management consulting arm of Deloitte and Touche, the world's fifth
biggest accountancy firm, is being sued for Dollars 250m. Figgie
International, a struggling Ohio-based group, alleges that Deloitte failed
in its promise to install a world class manufacturing programme for the
company.
While it is not uncommon for accountancy firms to be sued, it is very
unusual in the case of management consultants.
Figgie says that over a three-year period beginning in late 1990, Deloitte
promised 'to develop and transfer technologies that would improve
manufacturing throughput (and) decrease inventory levels'. It claims to have
paid Deloitte fees and expenses of over Dollars 22m, and to have been billed
for a further Dollars 33m.
In the event, Figgie moved from a net profit of Dollars 63m in 1989 to a
loss last year of Dollars 129m. Having breached financial covenants, it was
forced into a financial restructuring this summer.
Figgie's business ranges from electronic systems and materials handling
equipment to insurance, sports goods and real estate.
Figgie says 'the consulting firm at various times misrepresented to Figgie
the progress and achievements of the world class manufacturing projects it
designed and implemented'. It also claims Deloitte failed to staff the
projects with professionally competent personnel.
Deloitte was unavailable for comment last night.

<TEXT>
Union des Assurances de Paris, one of France's largest insurance groups,
yesterday reported consolidated profits down 22 per cent to FFr853m (Dollars
161.55m) in the first six months of the year.
Consolidated insurance income rose 14 per cent, or 9 per cent on a
like-for-like basis, to FFr81bn, including a contribution from non-life
business of FFr42.9bn.
The figures included a substantial charge triggered by a jump in goodwill
amortisation to FFr509m in the six months to June 30, against FFr384m in the
first half last year.
Mr Jacques Friedman, chairman, said the year-end results should be improved
over those of last year, but admitted that they would not increase 'to the
extent of the objectives we had set ourselves in very different conditions a
few months ago'.
He said the accounts showed a 'favourable trend in technical insurance
conditions', which he believed were likely to be replicated in the second
half of the year. He highlighted expanded activity, improved technical
results and productivity gains.
However, he cautioned about the uncertainty caused by current economic
conditions, and said that the decline in the results was triggered by a
deterioration of the financial and property markets.
Premium income generated outside France represented 65 per cent of the total
for the first half of the year. Overall, the company said there was an
improvement in non-life insurance technical conditions and in the
claims/premium ratio.
It said worsening property and financial markets had led to greater property
provisions in subsidiaries now under the control of UAP, UAP Vie and UAP
Incendie Accident.
Banque Worms, its banking subsidiary, incurred a loss of FFr394m for the
first half, lower than budgeted and dragging down overall banking results
for the UAP group to FFr438m from FFr4362m.

It is a listing requirement in Hong Kong that directors notify the stock

to disqualification.
Share trading in Ming Pao and South Sea Development, a property developer
and investment company, was suspended on Monday after a newspaper revealed
Mr Yu's previous conviction. In its statement about the pending inquiry, the
stock exchange said trading would resume today.
Mr Yu, 35, owns 60.5 per cent of Ming Pao, and 36 per cent of South Sea.
Late Monday night Mr Yu confirmed that he had served a four-month prison
term in Canada in 1979 after being convicted of credit card and cheque
fraud, and possession of a firearm.
'I deeply regret my behaviour in my youth and in regard to my past behaviour
I have already paid for my wrongs and learnt my lesson from this,' he said
in a statement.
The revelation of his past wrongdoing has focused public attention on one of
Hong Kong's most shadowy business people. The source of his funds for the
acquisition of control of Ming Pao in 1991 remains unknown and subject to
much speculation, especially given his youth.
One source of his wealth and influence may be mainland China. Through his
privately-held CIM, Mr Yu has joint venture car dealerships for Ferrari and
Toyota. He also has joint ventures in magazine publishing, advertising, and
cable TV - all 'sensitive' areas where China's Communist party likes to keep
tight control.
CIM is also Mr Yu's vehicle for satellite TV. By the end of this year
analysts expect Asia Integrated Management, a subsidiary, to be broadcasting
two Mandarin Chinese channels to Taiwan and possibly further afield. He has
cable TV ambitions in Hong Kong.
But the jewel in his crown still remains Ming Pao. It publishes the Ming Pao
Daily News, arguably Hong Kong's most prestigious Chinese language daily.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: PepsiCo holds its own in brands
battle

PepsiCo, the US soft drinks and fast-food company, brought cheer to its
shareholders yesterday with quarterly figures suggesting it was fighting off
the threat to its core Pepsi-Cola brand from own-label cola drinks.
The news from its fast-food restaurant businesses, however, was less
encouraging. Pizza Hut did particularly badly with operating profits
dropping by 25 per cent, partly due to a decline in take-away sales in the
US.
Overall, net income for the third quarter to September 3 was Dollars 541.4m.
This was 18 per cent higher than the comparable quarter's Dollars 458.2m -
although excluding a tax adjustment in the prior year, growth would have
been a less impressive 11 per cent.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 7.1bn and earnings per share, boosted
by company share repurchases, rose to 68 cents from 56 cents.
The results were a significant improvement over the second-quarter
performance, when weakness in the soft drink and restaurant businesses
brought underlying profits growth to standstill. Wall Street responded by
marking the shares up Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 in early trading.
In the beverage division, strong sales growth pushed world-wide revenues up
13 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn. This produced a 19 per cent increase in
operating profits to Dollars 422.2m in spite of higher discounts to
retailers, a symptom of competition from other cola brands.
Restaurant revenue increased by 9 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn, but profit
advances at Taco Bell and KFC (formerly Kentucky Fried Chicken) were more
than offset by the decline at Pizza Hut, leaving the division's operating
profits 5 per cent down at Dollars 211.1m.
For the nine months, underlying profits (excluding unusual charges) were 7
per cent ahead at Dollars 1.3bn.

<TEXT>
Reliance Industries, India's largest company, yesterday posted a 146 per
cent increase in interim net profits to Rs5.1bn (Dollars 162m), due to
strong demand, improved productivity and worldwide increases in chemicals
prices.
Sales in the six months to end-September rose 33 per cent to Rs32.9bn,
pushing up operating profits by 41 per cent to Rs7.4bn. Earnings per share
soared 91 per cent to Rs31.45.
Reliance is among the first of the large companies to report results for the
half-year. Analysts expect many groups to post rises due to a recovery in
Indian industry following more than two years of stagnation, partly induced
by reductions in public spending due to reforms introduced by Mr PV
Narasimha Rao, prime minister.
Mr Anil Ambani, managing director, said: 'We benefited from growing
consumption of all our products in India, from productivity increases and
from a cyclical turnround in the chemicals industry.'
Reliance, which produces textiles, plastics, and petroleum-based chemicals,
has grown in 30 years to overtake old-established companies such as Tata
Iron and Steel, the country's largest private steelmaker, as India's biggest
company.
It is expanding capacity and diversifying into financial services, power and
telecommunications.

McCormick, the US food products group, is planning to cut about 600 jobs, or
7 per cent of its workforce, in a restructuring, AP-DJ reports.
The company said that as a result it expects to record a one-time, pre-tax
charge of up to Dollars 66m in its fiscal fourth quarter ending November 30.
It added that the restructuring would include closing its Hayward,
California, production facility, realignment of some of its operations in
the UK and sale of its Golden West Foods unit.
Plant closures will occur during the next two years and staff reductions
will begin no earlier than February 1 1995, the company said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: NTT hopes London listing will
lift profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's public telecommunications operator
and the world's biggest company by market capitalisation - it is valued at
Y13,603bn (Dollars 135.2bn) - will today be listed on the London Stock
Exchange.
NTT hopes the listing will lift its foreign profile, improve its ability to
raise equity internationally and stimulate foreign business alliances. This
follows the listing of NTT American Depositary Receipts in New York on
September 29.
'With the advent of multi-media, we are pursuing affiliations and tie-ups
with various companies and countries and believe a listing will heighten our
name recognition,' said Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT president.
NTT's foreign listings come as it is preparing to face a fresh battle
against plans by the ministry of posts and telecommunications to split up
its long-distance and local businesses.
The ministry hopes, in a review of the structure of Japan's
telecommunications market next year, to emulate the success of AT&amp;T, the US
telecommunications operator, after it was split up in 1983. NTT argues that
the investment demands of multimedia make a split inappropriate.
Over the past year, the group has entered joint ventures with three US
software groups to develop multimedia.
It is negotiating with British Telecommunications for a joint venture,
between NTT and IBM of the US, to provide high-speed international data
communications. Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, meanwhile, is interested in a
possible stake in NTT's personal 'handyphone' service to open in Japan next
year.
NTT's foreign links are small, partly a reflection of the fact that it is
the only leading national telecommunications group not allowed to operate
international services.
The Japanese finance ministry owns 65.6 per cent of NTT, which was partially
privatised in 1985, but has been hindered from selling more by the weakness
of Japan's stock market.
The group reported a 42.4 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits
to Y175bn in the year to last March, on turnover up by 2.8 per cent to
Y6,687bn.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sappi leads S Africa out of the
woods - Pulp and paper group has become a global force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company which this week announced it
was acquiring US producer SD Warren for Dollars 1.6bn, has long had the goal
of becoming a global player in the paper industry by 2000.
Guided by Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, the unexpected announcement
seems to indicate that the company has achieved its target a few years
earlier than anticipated.
In the process it has become South Africa's first truly global industrial
company, following a route previously trodden only by the country's big
mining houses.
By adding SD Warren, which is dominant in the US coated paper market, to its
operations in South Africa and Europe, the company has become one of the
world's bigger paper producers.
More notably, it is now the global leader in dissolving pulp and coated
wood-free papers, both fast-growing niche markets in the paper business.
'I am delighted with the acquisition. It complements our existing operations
and will play a key role in our future success,' says Mr van As.
In spite of his confidence in Sappi's future, the road ahead is far from
certain, and analysts and shareholders are not unanimous in their support
for the latest move.
The company remains dominant in the local market, with a 50 per cent share
of the broader pulp and paper industry, and its interests encompass
everything from raw timber to finished papers.
It owns 340,000ha of forest in the southern Africa region - which will in
effect be doubled to 765,000ha with the addition of SD Warren's timber
interests - and has a wide range of domestic plants covering craft papers,
fine papers and pulp.
Sappi's Saiccor plant, acquired from UK-based Courtaulds in 1988, has long
been the world's largest and lowest-cost producer of dissolving pulp, which
is used in the production of viscose for rayon fibre and cellophane film.
It is undergoing a R1bn (Dollars 280m) expansion and the bulk of its
production is targeted for export.
Given the size of its share of the local market, Sappi has for several years
been diverting an increasing portion of local production for export. It has
also formed a wide-ranging international trading company.
Complementing this, it made its first foreign acquisition in 1990, buying
five paper mills in the UK. Two years later, the company bought German-based
coated paper producer Hannovier Papier.
Nevertheless, during this period, South Africa's long recession and a global
slump in paper prices severely weakened local sales.
The situation was further aggravated by increased competition from imports,
particularly from Brazil and Finland, which have taken advantage of South
Africa's traditionally low tariffs on paper products to exploit the top end
of the local market.
Adding to Sappi's woes, the European recession severely dented its newly
acquired operations there, and Hannovier has so far been a disappointment -
as well as a severe drain on resources.
Worse, Hannovier's recent losses have severely dented Sappi's bottom line
becauses of the continued depreciation of the rand.
In response, the company's earnings plunged and it was forced to suspend
dividends. Sappi reported after-tax earnings of R142.2m for 1993-94, down
from R604m as recently as 1990.
But the domestic market has picked up and Hannovier, which appears to have
turned the corner, is expected to make a significant contribution to
earnings this financial year.
Nevertheless, most analysts had expected Sappi to wait before making another
international foray, giving itself time to consolidate its existing
operations and build up cash.
But the lure of SD Warren appears to have been too great for Mr van As to
resist. The Dollars 1.6bn purchase price is high in terms of the current
standing of paper stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, but as the
Hannovier deal showed, Mr van As is always willing to take a gamble.
The attraction lay in the overall quality of SD Warren, its strengths in an
area where Sappi has considerable expertise, and positive industry
projections for sales in the coated wood-free sector, which are expected to
outstrip all other main paper and board products over the next five years.
The relative ease of finding partners and putting together a financial
package seems to have been equally important. Traditionally, South African
companies have trod cautiously in the international arena, hampered by
strict exchange controls at home and the country's political reputation
abroad.
Now, however, as mining house Gencor's Dollars 1.3bn acquisition of Billiton
in July demonstrated, South African companies have gained a new
acceptability.
Indeed, as Sappi's executives noted with some surprise, several banks
competed vigorously to organise the Sappi deal, in spite of the company's
inability to raise money domestically or borrow against local assets because
of exchange restrictions.
'Having been the pariahs of the world for so long it was very pleasing to
see some of the best banks in the world competing to do business with us,'
says Mr van As.
'For Sappi this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and we were fortunate
to have on our side financiers with a breadth of vision and a commitment to
make the deal succeed.'
However, with a new debt/equity ration of 1.25, up from its current level of
0.4 and nearly five times the company's stated aim of a ratio of 0.35, Sappi
and its backers will need both vision and commitment to make the venture
succeed.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cellular phones help Motorola
jump 50%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worldwide demand for cellular telephones helped to boost Motorola's sales
and earnings to record levels for the third quarter and year to date.
The US communications, electronics and semiconductor group lifted
third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 380m, up almost 50 per cent from
Dollars 254m. Earnings per share jumped to 65 cents from 44 cents. Revenues
rose 28 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 4.4bn in the same period last
year.
Motorola's largest businesses - wireless communications and semiconductors -
saw revenues grow strongly. Sales of cellular telephone equipment advanced
63 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn.
The number of cellular telephone service subscribers worldwide grew to
nearly 50m, an increase of about 50 per cent from the end of 1993.
Motorola was awarded contracts during the third quarter for digital cellular
systems to be built in Moscow, Hong Kong and Nigeria. Contracts for analog
cellular systems came from the Philippines and several countries in Africa.
Other parts of Motorola's wireless communications business - including
two-way radios, pagers and wireless data communications for mobile computer
users - together accounted for Dollars 1.5bn in revenues, up 23 per cent on
the same period last year.
Semiconductor sales rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, continuing an
uninterrupted record of more than five years' growth. The company's largest
chip customers are the automotive and communications industries.
In a push to increase its presence in the computer industry, both as a chip
supplier and a systems manufacturer, Motorola is collaborating with IBM and
Apple Computer on the development of PowerPC microprocessor chips.
Last week Motorola launched a range of computers based on PowerPC to be sold
through third parties. In the third quarter, however, its computer sales
rose only 2 per cent and orders were flat. Revenues for this segment were
not reported separately.
For the first nine months Motorola's sales reached Dollars 15.8bn, up 32 per
cent from Dollars 12bn a year ago. Net earnings were Dollars 1.05bn, or
Dollars 1.79 a share, compared with Dollars 682m, or Dollars 1.20. The 1993
per-share figures were restated for a 2-for-1 stock split in April.

rights issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sanyo Securities, the troubled Japanese broker, yesterday announced it would
raise Y20bn (Dollars 198m) through a rights issue to its three leading
creditor banks - Nippon Credit Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Daiwa Bank - and
Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder.
A total of 41.7m shares at Y480 each will be issued with payment set for the
end of this month. Of these, 33.8m, or 81 per cent, will be allotted to
Nomura Land Building, a property subsidiary of Nomura, raising the company's
stake to 16.3 per cent from 5.3 per cent.
Nippon Credit Bank and Bank of Tokyo will each take 2.7m shares, raising
their stakes to 5 per cent from 4.8 per cent, while Daiwa Bank will purchase
2.6m shares, raising its holding to 4.7 per cent from 4.5 per cent.
The funding is part of Sanyo's restructuring programme, announced last
March, which the broker is carrying out under the supervision of the three
banks and Nomura. Sanyo, one of Japan's 10 medium-sized broking houses, has
been hit by Y70bn in non-performing loans at its finance affiliate.
Last month, the three creditor banks reduced their interest rates on loans
to Sanyo's affiliates to 1.25 per cent. Other city banks also lowered their
rates to 2 per cent, said Mr Takashi Ikeuchi, Sanyo president. Interest
rates on loans from other banks and insurance companies were cut to 2.5 per
cent, with those from non-bank finance companies lowered to 3 per cent, he
said.
During the late 1980s, the broker had ambitions of becoming a large
financial conglomerate with stockbroking and banking as its main pillars.
After the collapse in asset prices in 1990, Sanyo's affiliates were left
with mounting bad loans, which squeezed the parent company's profit margins.
Sanyo was hit by the bad loan burden and declining revenue due to the slump
on the Tokyo stock market.

production rises

Gold Fields of South Africa reported that its gold mines increased after-tax
profit by 14.3 per cent to R448m (Dollars 126.50m) for the September
quarter, up from R392m the previous quarter.
The increase was largely the result of improved overall production.
In spite of a drop in the grade of ore milled, to 9.2 grammes/tonne from 9.3
grammes/tonne in the June quarter, gold production rose to 30,612kg from
29,721kg. This was due to a substantial rise in ore milled to 3.33m tonnes
from 3.2m tonnes.
Overall gold revenue rose to R1.37bn from R1.29bn while working profit
advanced to R589m from R543m. However, working costs increased to R786m from
R751m, mainly because of wage increases starting from the beginning of the
quarter.
Of the group's bigger individual mines, Driefontein boosted after-tax
profits to R241.6m from R194.5m while Kloof increased after-tax earnings to
R193.8m from R190m.
Doornfontein, a marginal mine, reduced costs and raised revenue, reducing
its pre-tax loss to R1.9m from the previous quarter's deficit of R8.8m.
However, in spite of increased production, Deelkraal saw a drop in after-tax
profit to R14.5m from R15.7m as it resumed paying tax following last
quarter's R8m rebate.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Elf Sanofi sells food additive
units to Viag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elf Sanofi, the drugs and beauty products subsidiary of French chemicals
group Elf Aquitaine, yesterday took another step in a disposals programme
designed to raise more than Dollars 1bn.
The bio-industries and rendering businesses were sold to Viag, the German
industrial and energy conglomerate, for FFr4.4bn (Dollars 830m). These
business supply the food industries with additives such as pectin and
xanthan gum.
Sanofi embarked on a disposals programme when it bought Sterling Winthrop's
prescription pharmaceutical activities from Eastman Kodak for Dollars 1.68bn
in June.
'We decided then to sell all our bio-activities. Animal health and seeds
activities are not yet sold, but we are in talks to sell them,' said Mr
Jean-Francois Dehecq, Sanofi's chairman and chief executive.
The company is also making small disposals from the beauty side, and said
its 46 per cent shareholding in the Entremont cheese-making business would
also eventually be sold.
Mr Jean-Claude Leroy, finance director, said Sanofi hoped to sign agreements
for the sale of the remainder of its bio-activities by the end of the year.
The company's target was to raise FFr6.5bn from the sale of the bio-activity
portfolio, he said.
Mr Leroy said Sanofi should be paid by Viag by December 31, so it would have
to carry financing charges for the Sterling acquisition until then.
The food additives business had sales in 1993 of FFr3.3bn. Sales to food
manufacturers accounted for 80 per cent of revenues.
The rendering business, which processes 1.5m tonnes of meat and fish
by-products annually, had sales last year of FFr1.5bn. Most of its business
is in France, Germany and Spain.
For Munich-based Viag, the acquisition of these businesses will strengthen
its position in food additives and in the French market.
Mr Dehecq said that once the disposals of the bio-industries had been
accomplished, the company would have completed its transition to a business
with just two industrial divisions. The first will be prescription
pharmaceuticals and medical diagnostics, the other beauty products including
the Yves Saint Laurent range.

<TEXT>
Kvaerner, Norway's second- largest stock market listed company, warned
yesterday that losses on a project by the oil and gas division, along with
restructuring costs, would damage profits for the first eight months of this
year.
Profits for the full year would also decline, it said.
It expects the oil and gas division to incur a loss of about NKr200m
(Dollars 29.8m) for the first eight months, and losses of the same order for
1994, because of losses on deliveries to the Troll oil project and
restructuring costs of the division. 'This result partly reflects a
substantial loss already reported by the group on its deliveries to the
Troll oil platform in the Norwegian North Sea,' it said.
Kvaerner said this implied a weaker 1994 result for the group as a whole.
Last time, profits before unrealised foreign currency items and tax reached
NKr1.5bn. The company had earlier forecast profits for 1994 at the same
level as the year before.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: International Paper earnings
rise 47%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The strength of the upswing in the US paper cycle was underlined yesterday
by a 47 per cent jump in third quarter net earnings at International Paper,
the world's largest paper company.
Mr John Georges, chairman, said he expected even stronger earnings in the
fourth quarter, and added: 'We believe that we will see even more robust
growth in 1995.'
Mr Georges said the economic upturn in the US, Europe and the Pacific Rim
meant that the company was experiencing higher prices and greater demand for
all its products.
'As the worldwide economies improve, we expect demand for paper and
packaging products to grow faster than the industry's manufacturing
capacity,' he said.
Earnings were up in packaging and board and remained at a high level in
forest products. Printing papers were in profit for the first time in two
years, helped by a very strong market for pulp and a sharp recovery in
Europe. However, profits were down in the group's speciality products
division, a catch-all category which ranges from oil and chemicals to Ilford
photographic film.
Group sales in the quarter were up 11 per cent at Dollars 3.79bn, with the
strongest rises in printing papers (up 19 per cent) and packaging (up 13 per
cent).
The slowest sales growth came in forest products (up 4 per cent), which had
recovered earlier in the cycle.
Pre-tax profits were up 40 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 167m, bringing
the nine-month increase to 20 per cent.
Earnings per share were up 47 per cent at 87 cents for the quarter - the
highest figure since the second quarter of 1992, but still well below the
levels reached in the last cyclical peak.
The figures further contributed to a feeling of optimism in the US paper
industry created by Scott Paper's Dollars 1.6bn sale of its SD Warren
subsidiary to Sappi of South Africa on Monday. Analysts had commented that
Scott's success in selling the business would be a test of confidence in the
sector's outlook.
After earlier gains, International Paper's shares fell Dollars  3/8 to close
at Dollars 77 1/2.

phone accord

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and communications group,
yesterday announced alliances with Vodafone of the UK and Southwestern Bell
(SBC) of the US aimed at strengthening its position in the French mobile
telephone market and entering the sector in North America.
As a result, the capital of Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone (SFR),
Generale des Eaux's mobile telephone subsidiary, will be increased by about
FFr3bn (Dollars 567m). The group said it would use the resources to develop
its cellular telecoms operations.
Vodafone, which already holds a 4 per cent stake in Cofira, the holding
company of SFR, will exchange its stake for a direct 10 per cent holding in
SFR. The transaction will involve a cash payment of FFr880m.
SBC is to take a 10 per cent stake in Cofira. It will do this through the
purchase of a 22 per cent stake in a holding company which will control
Cofira. Generale des Eaux will hold the balance of the shares. SBC said last
night its investment would total Dollars 626m.
Under the terms of the agreement, Generale des Eaux will pay Dollars 247m
for a 10 per cent stake in the radio telephone franchises operated by
Southwestern Bell in the Washington DC and Baltimore regions.
Separately, SBC said it would acquire 10 per cent of certain French cable-TV
properties owned by CGV, a Generale des Eaux subsidiary.
The US group said terms of that deal were still being negotiated.
The agreements reflect the desire by Mr Guy Dejouany, chairman of Generale
des Eaux, to find industrial allies in its mobile telecoms activities.
Earlier this year he told shareholders he was seeking the formation of
partnerships with foreign telecoms operators with substantial financial and
technological resources.
Last week, the French government announced the award of a third mobile
telephones licence aimed at stimulating the domestic market.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sharp fall in Europe's M&amp;A
activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merger and acquisition activity in Europe fell in the third quarter of this
year to the lowest level this decade, although there was a sharp upturn in
the US, according to Securities Data, a leading compiler of league tables of
investment banks.
The total value of transactions in Europe dropped to Dollars 21bn in the
three months to September, representing a 35 per cent decline on the
quarterly average in 1993. Outside the US, activity dipped to Dollars
35.5bn, the lowest since 1988.
A stagnant corporate takeover market in Europe contrasts sharply with the
US, where economic recovery pushed M&amp;A volume up 33 per cent to Dollars
236.6bn in the first three quarters of 1994. 'The feelgood factor that is in
the US is not in Europe yet,' a US investment banker said.
The figures show that M&amp;A activity has been slow to recover in spite of
renewed economic growth in Europe. However, investment banks in London are
adding staff in their corporate advisory departments in anticipation of a
revival in activity.
The league tables of activity and advisers cover completed deals, which can
lag announcements by several months and initial approaches by even longer.
Most investment banks report a healthy 'pipeline' of deals as companies
which have weathered the recession look again at expansion. M&amp;A departments
expect strategic deals in sectors such as health care, automotive
components, telecommunications, financial services and chemicals.
Another impetus could come from financial investors such as Glenisla, a
takeover fund set up with backing from investors Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
SG Warburg, the UK investment bank which issued a profit warning last week
after setbacks in bond and equity markets, headed the league table of
advisers on European M&amp;A, as it did in Securities Data's 1993 report.
Warburg advised on 43 deals worth Dollars 13.6bn in the first three
quarters, giving it market share of 16.5 per cent. The UK house advised
Banco Santander of Spain on its Dollars 2.4bn acquisition of Banesto and on
the merger between Akzo, the Netherlands chemical company, and Nobel
Industrie of Sweden.
Warburg was placed behind two US investment banks in the most recent league
table of advisers on European cross-border transactions drawn up by
Acquisitions Monthly, the other big compiler of M&amp;A data.
While the precise rankings vary depending on the criteria, Warburg and US
investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs usually lead the
pan-European tables.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kvaerner lowers forecast as oil
and gas side incurs loss
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kvaerner, Norway's second largest stock market-listed company, warned
yesterday that losses on a project by the oil and gas division, along with
restructuring costs, would damage profits for the first eight months of this
year.
Profits for the full year would also decline, it said.
It expects the oil and gas division to incur a loss of about NKr200m
(Dollars 29.8m) for the first eight months, and losses of the same order for
1994, because of losses on deliveries to the Troll oil project and
restructuring costs of the division.
'This result partly reflects a substantial loss already reported by the
group on its deliveries to the Troll oil platform in the Norwegian North
Sea,' it said.
Kvaerner, headed by Mr Erik Tonseth, said this implied a weaker 1994 result
for the group as a whole. Last time, profits before unrealised foreign
currency items and tax reached NKr1.5bn. The company had earlier forecast
profits for 1994 at the same level as the year before.
Kvaerner is due on Friday to report full figures for the first eight months.
In the first four months of the year, the group boosted pre-tax profits by
36 per cent to NKr590m. However, the oil and gas division saw pre-tax
profits cut by more than half, to NKr57m from NKr135m.
The division plunged into an operating loss of NKr3m in the period after a
profit of NKr116m a year earlier.
Last week Aker, the Norwegian oil and gas technology and cement and building
materials group and Kvaerner's main competitor for deliveries to the oil and
gas sector, reported a fall in pre-tax profits by its oil and gas technology
division, to NKr156m from NKr343m. It also warned of lower annual profit.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: US hospital group to pay Dollars
2bn for rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
National Medical Enterprises, one of the biggest US hospital groups, is to
pay nearly Dollars 2bn in cash and stock for American Medical, another large
hospital chain.
The deal comes just a week after National Medical lost out to Columbia/HCA,
the US's biggest hospital company, in a Dollars 3.5bn bidding war for
HealthTrust, which owns 116 hospitals.
The purchase of American Medical, if completed, will leave National Medical
with 71 large acute-care hospitals and annual sales which it predicts next
year will reach Dollars 5.3bn, compared with Dollars 15bn in the merged
Columbia/HCA and HealthTrust.
The proposed acquisition comes a year after National Medical was almost
brought to its knees by allegations of fraud and abuse of patients in its
psychiatric hospitals, which have since been sold.
The deal, which echoes the three multi-billion-dollar takeovers engineered
by Columbia/HCA in the past 18 months, is intended in part to reduce costs
by increasing the enlarged group's bargaining power with hospital supply
companies. It also reflects the growing importance of large institutional
buyers of healthcare, such as health maintenance organisations.
National Medical is paying Dollars 1.46bn in cash, and stock valued
yesterday at Dollars 496m. The cash will come from bank borrowing and a bond
issue, the company said.
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street firm, has supplied the company
with a letter stating that it is 'highly confident' it can raise the bond
finance - a technique common in the 1980s, when junk bond finance became a
significant element in many takeovers.
The use of such letters has re-emerged as a tool in US takeovers this year,
most notably in the Dollars 2.7bn agreed offer by Conseco, an insurer, for
financial services group Kemper, which was supported by a 'highly confident'
letter from Morgan Stanley.
That financing, however, has looked increasingly shaky in recent weeks.
Conseco, at first said it would finance a larger part of the bid by selling
assets, so reducing the junk bond portion. However, last week it filed to
issue convertible bonds, a move taken as a sign the asset sales were not
proceeding smoothly.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pechiney sets sights on cutting
debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pechiney, the French state-controlled metals group, plans to reduce its debt
'sharply and rapidly', partly through assets sales, in the hope of being
privatised after the end of 1995, Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the new president,
said yesterday.
Mr Rodier told the Tribune Desfosses, the French newspaper, that after two
months in his post he had started a detailed study of what Pechiney might
sell to reduce its FFr20bn (Dollars 3.8bn) debt. 'The problem is not so much
selling assets as choosing well what you want to keep,' he said.
The newspaper raised the possibility of Pechiney selling Howmet, its US
aircraft and engine components subsidiary, either through a stock market
flotation or a management buy-out. Mr Rodier, however, stressed that no
decision had been taken.
Mr Rodier's background is in the non-ferrous metals industry, most recently
with Union Miniere of Belgium, and he said he could not imagine Pechiney
'without a significant activity in aluminium'.
He welcomed the recent pick-up in world demand and prices for aluminium, due
in large part to joint action by Western and Russian producers to cut back
output.
He also reaffirmed the Dollars 1bn plan of Pechiney, along with Bechtel of
the US and Morgan Grenfell, the British bank, to modernise Russian aluminium
factories.

<TEXT>
Wescol Group, the Halifax-based steel fabrication and construction company,
has continued its recovery and, following a stronger second half, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 260,000 for the 12 months to July 31.
The increase from last time's Pounds 30,000 was achieved on turnover ahead
from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 18.3m, and reflected a reduced interest burden
following last November's Pounds 2.9m rights issue. The directors said the
company was now cash positive.
Mr Peter Price, chairman, said the company was seeing 'a much closer balance
of capacity and demand' and intended to enlarge the Halifax factory to
provide additional production and design facilities. Current order intake
showed a 'substantial' improvement over last year.
Earnings per share were 1p (0.4p) and a dividend of 0.25p - the first since
1990 - is proposed. The company plans to move from the USM to the Official
List 'in a few weeks'.

</HEADLINE>

A Beckman, the property and textiles group, announced pre-tax profits nearly
halved from Pounds 790,000 to Pounds 403,000 in the year to June 30.
Mr Melvin Lawson, chairman, said textiles margins had been squeezed while
rental income had fallen mainly because of vacant space.
Although that had now largely been relet it was at lower rents and as a
consequence the associated company suffered a loss, of which the group's
share was Pounds 128,000. The properties have been revalued downwards and
there would be ongoing losses for the foreseeable future, Mr Lawson said.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 14.5m) with property contributing
slightly less at Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.55m). Earnings per share fell to 2p
(4.7p) but the dividend is held at 3.58p with a proposed unchanged final of
2.38p.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Welpac loss deepens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Welpac fell by 3p to 14p yesterday after the hardware and
gardening products maker reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.25m for the
half year to July 31. There were losses of Pounds 138,000 last time although
continuing operations produced a Pounds 1,000 profit.
The result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 25,000),
being redundancy costs of Pounds 144,000 and an Pounds 80,000 loss on the
termination of a supply arrangement.
Mr Gerald Lavender, chairman, said the 'extremely disappointing' results
were largely because of a fall in turnover, particularly in the second
quarter when sales were 26 per cent below budget. Turnover of continuing
operations declined to Pounds 7.88m (Pounds 10.1m).
Interest charges fell to Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 266,000) partly because of
the Pounds 2.64m received from the placing and open offer in May.
Losses per share deepened to 3.2p (0.5p).
Mr Peter Dixon, who has been appointed a director, will take over as
non-executive chairman in February. Mr Lavender retires from the board at
the 1995 AGM.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BOC/ Hewlett deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOC, the chemicals company, and Hewlett Packard, the US electronics group,
will today announce the establishment of a network of alliances around the
world to sell anaesthetics and the associated monitoring equipment.
The arrangement involves no cash changing hands but is likely to lead to
some job cuts as the two companies 'streamline' their sales and service
organisations.
BOC said that neither it nor HP would forecast the sales revenue that would
flow through the new sales organisations but that they it expected to
increase their 'access to the Dollars 1bn a year global anaesthesia
equipment market'.
Ohmeda, BOC's healthcare business, based in New Jersey, had 1993 revenue of
Dollars 880m. HP's medical products group, in Massachusetts, had sales last
year of Dollars 1.2bn.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged William Sinclair moves ahead 9% to
Pounds 4.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'sound performance' across the group, with increases in sales, profits and
margins, was yesterday reported by William Sinclair Holdings.
Pre-tax profits of the Lincoln-based group, which supplies products to the
garden, leisure and pet markets, showed a 9.3 per cent advance from Pounds
3.82m to Pounds 4.17m in the year to June 30. Turnover was up 7.4 per cent
from Pounds 38.5m to Pounds 41.3m.
The figures included a contribution from the peat business acquired for
Pounds 2.76m from Zeneca in late January.
This business had been successfully integrated into the horticultural
division, said Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, and would make the company
self-sufficient in peat.
Because of the seasonal nature of the group's activities, and their
susceptibility to adverse weather conditions, it was impossible to indicate
any significant trends at this stage, he said.
The spring season - the most important sales period for the group - got off
to a very poor start. 'Most people have probably by now forgotten that April
this year had been one of the wettest on record for some 60 years,' Mr
Sinclair said, and this had resulted in additional costs.
However, sales volumes subsequently recovered and, helped by the increased
acreage made available by the Zeneca purchase, the peat harvest turned out
to be satisfactory.
The bulk of the group's income is still derived from the horticultural
division which, bolstered by a Pounds 164,000 contribution from the Zeneca
business, made an operating profit of Pounds 2.82m (Pounds 2.46m) from
turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 28.6m).
The pet, aquatic and household division achieved operating profits of Pounds
1.34m (Pounds 1.21m) on sales of Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 9.89m). Companies
within this division operated in a fragmented market, Mr Sinclair said, and
the group had embarked on a programme to merge them.
Sinclair ended the year with a strong balance sheet, with no borrowings and
net cash of Pounds 4.75m.
Earnings came out at 13p (12.2p) per share and a proposed final dividend of
5.45p makes a total for the year of 7.15p (7p).

Inchcape, the international motors, services and marketing group, has sold
the services area on the M5 motorway at Strensham, Worcestershire, to its
management for about Pounds 12m, writes Andrew Bolger.
Inchcape acquired the site with TKM, the motor dealer it bought for Pounds
383m in 1992.
The Strensham management was backed by the Birmingham office of 3i, the
investment capital group, and advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Edge and
Ellison in Birmingham.
Strensham, which will now trade under the TakeaBreak name, is situated on
both sides of the M5 motorway, and employs 209 full-time staff and 65
part-timers, catering for 6m visitors annually.
3i led the equity element of the total finance requirement of Pounds 16.8m,
providing Pounds 4m.

Pre-tax losses at Lendu Holdings, which invests in irrigated and dryland
cotton, cereal and beef cattle production in Queensland, were Pounds 87,000
for the year to June 30. Turnover was Pounds 589,000. Losses at the interim
stage were Pounds 126,000.
The company said widespread drought in eastern Australia had led to a lack
of any significant cotton crop, but this was partly offset by a better than
expected wheat crop.
Earnings per share were 0.29p and the recommended dividend is halved to
0.25p.
Lendu achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.15m for the 18 months ended June
30 1993 on turnover of Pounds 1.95m, including Pounds 549,000 from
discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 8.68p.
The change in the year end was to coincide with the cropping cycle of
cotton.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Thorntons confirms recovery with Pounds
12.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer, yesterday reported record
annual profits and sales for the year to June 25, confirming its return to
the black at the interim stage.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 12.1m against a loss of Pounds 4.8m, when there
was a one-off provision of Pounds 7.63m to restructure the group's operation
in France, as well as a Pounds 5.41m charge for goodwill previously written
off to reserves.
Operating profits on continuing operations were 20 per cent ahead at Pounds
12.6m. Turnover grew to Pounds 96.6m, including Pounds 3.48m from
discontinued operations in France, against Pounds 92.5m, including Pounds
5.93m from discontinued operations.
Like-for-like sales in France eased from Pounds 4.65m to Pounds 4.4m against
a weak economic background. Commercial sales, mainly to Marks and Spencer
and Boots, were 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 15m, while sales from the
group's retail and franchise outlets were up by just over 7 per cent.
Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected
the benefits of changes made in the UK and France. The group would this year
concentrate on starting to iron out seasonal variations in its sales
patterns by attracting more daily trade.
At the moment the group has only 1 per cent of the daily confectionery
trade, but 6 per cent of the gift market. About 30 per cent of sales are
made in the Christmas period, with another surge at Easter.
The French operation, now concentrated on 20 shops in Paris, halved its
losses from Pounds 630,000 to Pounds 301,000. Mr Thornton said it was
breaking even in cash terms in spite of the disruption of reorganisation,
but he would not commit himself to predicting a profit this year.
The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 1.12m compared with
previous net borrowings of Pounds 8.08m. Net interest payable fell from
Pounds 978,000 to Pounds 469,000.
Earnings per share were 12.19p (11.94p losses). A final dividend of 3.45p
(2.4p) is recommended taking the total to 4.9p (3.65p).
COMMENT
Strong cash generation and a 34 per cent rise in the dividend highlight the
strength of Thorntons' recovery. The group is moving in the right direction
by trying to expand day-to-day sales of confectionery, but overall it
remains a seasonal business driven by the sale of gifts. Given no further
problems in France, and good sales at Christmas, profits can be expected to
top Pounds 13.5m this year. This, with the shares up 5p at 183p yesterday,
puts the group on a prospective multiple of 13, which is beginning to look
attractive.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Buoyant operating showing at TLG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Operating profits at TLG, the holding company for Thorn Lighting, which is
coming to the market next month, jumped from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 6.06m
for the five months to August 31.
The figures, published yesterday in the pathfinder prospectus, also showed
turnover ahead 4 per cent at Pounds 136.5m. Higher interest charges of
Pounds 4.21m, against Pounds 12,000, depressed pre-tax profits which
declined 41 per cent to Pounds 1.85m.
TLG, Europe's second biggest supplier of professional lighting systems, was
the subject of a Pounds 171.5m management buy-out from Thorn EMI in August
last year.
Its flotation involves a placing and public offer to raise about Pounds 77m
of new money. The company is expected to have a market capitalisation of
approximately Pounds 225m. Analysts are forecasting operating profits of
some Pounds 25m for the full year.
Most of the proceeds will go to repairing TLG's balance sheet, which
currently has gearing of 93 per cent. Following the float, gearing will drop
to just over 23 per cent.
Mr Hamish Bryce, TLG's executive chairman who led the MBO, stressed the
company's cash generative nature and said acquisitions could not be ruled
out. Germany, which has a fragmented lighting industry, was one area TLG had
earmarked for expansion.
Following the float, management, which is currently interested in 3 per cent
of the shares, would hold up to 11 per cent. Thorn's share of 12 per cent
would be diluted to about 7 per cent, while Investcorp, the Bahrain-based
international investment bank, would see its 77 per cent interest fall to
approximately 45 per cent.
The shares will be priced when the full prospectus is published on October
27. Applications close on November 3, with the basis of allocation announced
the next day.
Dealings in the shares will commence on November 10.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 4.93m write-off checks St Ives -
Losses on disposal of non-core businesses keep outcome flat at Pounds 22m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exceptional losses on the disposal of discontinued businesses held back
full-year pre-tax profits at St Ives, the UK's largest independent printer.
Although there was a marked improvement at the operating level. the pre-tax
line for the 52 weeks to July 29 was flat at Pounds 22.3m, compared with
Pounds 22.1m last time, on turnover ahead 7.1 per cent at Pounds 237m
(Pounds 221m).
Earnings per share slipped from 15.15p to 13.48p. To reflect the improved
underlying performance, however, an increased final dividend of 4.5p is
proposed, making a total of 6.4p (5.5p).
The shares closed 10p higher at 325p.
The pre-tax outcome was struck after first-half exceptional costs of Pounds
4.93m - representing goodwill previously written off to reserves - on the
disposal of two non-core businesses, Talbot Publishing Systems in December
and Nelson Packaging in March.
Excluding the exceptional items, pre-tax profits increased 23 per cent to
Pounds 27.2m and earnings per share grew 22 per cent to 18.46p.
Operating profits increased 25 per cent to Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 21m), while
net interest receipts fell to Pounds 908,000 from Pounds 1.04m.
Mr Miles Emley, chairman, described the results as 'somewhere between not
bad and quite good'. He said they reflected an improvement in some of the
group's markets, particularly UK magazines, which benefited from increased
paginations, and a turnround in the US magazine business.
However, conditions in the UK books market remained unsettled, particularly
as a result of destocking by the large retail chains towards the end of the
period. Even so, St Ives maintained or improved its market share in UK
general and hardback books and increased international sales of bibles.
The financial printing business was buoyant until the last two months of the
year, reflecting the high level of domestic and overseas new issues. The
direct mail printing business and compact disc packaging both made gains.
The group ended the period with net cash of more than Pounds 36m. It plans
to invest Pounds 47m in plant and equipment in the next 18 months, adding
about 15 per cent to capacity.
COMMENT
St Ives' underlying results were somewhat ahead of expectations. Capacity
utilisation in the UK print plants is back above 80 per cent, and overall
pre-tax margins have increased from 10.3 to 11.7 per cent - well below the
peak of 15 per cent, implying further progress is possible. Meanwhile, the
hefty capital expenditure programme should help keep profits moving ahead.
The pre-tax figure should reach about Pounds 31m this year, producing
earnings of about 21p. The shares are trading on a prospective multiple of
15.5, which looks reasonable for a quality printer.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: City welcomes a breath of clean air - Why
Domnick Hunter's shares have risen since its March flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's wave of new issues has proved to be a mixed bag. However, few
companies have made as good an impression on the City as Domnick Hunter
Group, a small manufacturer of filters for compressed air and liquids.
The Tyneside-based company came to the market in March through a placing
which gave it a market value of Pounds 65m. The flotation attracted a lot of
interest, in spite of the shares being aggressively priced at 200p, or 21.5
times historic earnings.
They have since risen to 262p, bolstered by last month's announcement of a
29 per cent increase in interim profits and an upbeat trading statement. So
just what is the attraction of this group, described by analysts as 'a
little gem' and 'one of the best small companies I have ever seen'?
Investors have been impressed by the group's strong market position: it
exports more than 60 per cent of its output to 40 countries and managed to
expand its sales and profits throughout the recession.
About 75 per cent of the group's sales come from its industrial division,
which makes filters that remove dirt, oil and moisture from compressed air.
Its most sensitive filters make air one million times cleaner than the air
we breathe.
Domnick Hunter makes significant revenue from replacement cartridges and
also supplies original equipment manufacturers, which incorporate the
group's filters into their own compressors.
A growing proportion of the industrial division's sales come from dryers,
which use molecular sieve technology developed in the US to produce clean
dry air for the most critical of applications, such as paint-spraying or the
handling of sensitive electronic components.
Mr Brian Thompson, chairman, says Domnick Hunter's real expertise lies not
just in manufacturing, but in finding solutions for each application. The
group uses computer-aided design to study how air flows through systems to
establish the optimum size and positioning of filters.
All this adds up to an extremely lucrative business, which has a wide spread
of customers both geographically and across a broad range of industries. The
division currently enjoys a margin of operating profits to sales of nearly
20 per cent.
However, what has most excited analysts about its prospects is the recent
move into making nitrogen generation equipment. In January it paid Pounds
1.7m for Nitrox, a manufacturer which it had been working with for several
years.
Mr Thompson says the group's new nitrogen generators, which he claims
produce nitrogen gas from compressed air at a fraction of the cost of
cylinder supplies, are attracting tremendous interest. Sales increased by 50
per cent to Pounds 660,000 in the first six months of the year.
Mr Thompson says: 'The potential nitrogen market is huge. Bottled is 35 per
cent of what is a Pounds 2bn worldwide market.'
Domnick Hunter's other division is process, which makes sophisticated
membranes to filter pharmaceuticals and liquids such as mineral water, wine
and spirits.
The business was established during the eighties to reduce the group's
dependence on compressed air, but is still described as being in an
evolutionary phase. Domnick Hunter is one of only a small number of
international companies which can make these membranes. Although smaller
than its US and German competitors, it has won more than 20 per cent of the
UK market.
The process division's sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 4.2m in the first
half, but heavy investment in an overseas sales network caused operating
profits to fall from Pounds 151,000 to Pounds 51,000.
Domnick Hunter was founded in 1963 and bought by the Scottish coachbuilder
Walter Alexander in the 1970s. In 1990 Mr Thompson led a Pounds 42m
management buy-out for the whole group. Two years later, the coachbuilding
division organised its own buy-out and the company was left as a specialist
filter operation.
The group employs 550, mainly divided between the group headquarters at
Birtley and a factory at Team Valley, both in Tyne and Wear. The flotation
reduced heavy borrowings and has allowed work to start on a Pounds 2.5m
extension to the industrial division's Birtley plant, expanding space by 50
per cent.
Domnick Hunter has also invested heavily in increasing efficiency. Both
managers and employees are converts to Japanese methods of continuous
improvement and just-in-time manufacturing. The enthusiastic atmosphere
apparent at the plants - which are set in an area of high unemployment  - is
fostered by regular team building activities.
The price increase since flotation means the shares are trading on a
prospective multiple that represents a 60 per cent-plus premium to the
market. However, the shares are tightly held. Given the group's quality and
growth prospects, institutions which snapped up stakes are likely to stay on
board.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Japanese move for Amersham - Deal sets
company on path to become a global healthcare business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amersham International yesterday took a stride towards becoming a global
healthcare business by paying Y8.52bn (Pounds 55m) for a 22 per cent stake
in Nihon Medi+Physics, Japan's largest manufacturer of 'nuclear medicines'.
The move follows three years of talks with Sumitomo Chemical Company, NMP's
parent, which has granted the UK health science group options to acquire a
further 30 per cent stake before the end of the decade.
'This will help Amersham to achieve market leading positions in each of the
world's three major nuclear medicine markets - Europe, North America and
Japan,' said Mr Bill Castell, Amersham chief executive.
If the UK group takes up the options, it would greatly enhance its presence
in the Japanese market for nuclear medicines, worth some Pounds 220m a year.
The world market for such medicines, which use radioactive materials to
identify diseased or damaged organs, is worth an estimated Pounds 700m.
The deal - financed from Yen-denominated borrowings - promises to increase
the size of Amersham's healthcare division by more than 60 per cent and
could contribute sales of Pounds 65m. This compares with last year's group
total of Pounds 324.2m.
Initially, the venture will allow the UK group to use NMP's facilities to
make and distribute its products in Japan, where it currently supplies 7 per
cent of the market.
In particular, Amersham forecasts growing demand for Ceretec - its brain
imaging agent - and an injectable version of Myoview, which detects heart
disease. It also hopes to launch Metastron, a pain relief agent for cancer,
in east Asia.
If Japan's Fair Trade Commission approves the link-up, Amersham will pay up
to Y9.78bn to raise its NMP holding to 50 per cent.
'While we're happy to take the first part of the acquisition on the balance
sheet, the second tranche could involve an equity placement,' said Mr
Castell.
For NMP, which enjoys a market share of close to 60 per cent, the deal
promises access to Amersham's lucrative international distribution network,
particularly in North America.
Last year, the Japanese company saw pre-tax profits rise 37 per cent to
Y3.4bn on sales ahead 13 per cent at Y20.7bn.
While hailing NMP's likely contribution, Amersham has insisted on an exit
clause allowing it resell the 20 per cent stake to Sumitomo at the original
purchase price should regulatory approval be withheld.
Although interest payments are expected to make the deal earnings dilutive
next year, City analysts welcomed the announcement.
'It's a good deal and will be earnings enhancing if the 50-50 partnership
goes ahead,' said one analyst.
Amersham's shares closed up 17p at 943p.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: N Brown improves 19% amid expanding
customer base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More buyers and greater spending per head helped N Brown Group, the
Manchester-based direct mail order group, announce a 19 per cent increase in
first-half profits.
In the 26 weeks to August 27, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds
9.02m) on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 98.4m (Pounds 86.2m).
Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said that of a total database of about 8m
people some 1.2m were buyers in the six months, 8 per cent up on last time.
Those 1.2m were spending 6 per cent more. The database lists about 200
attributes on each customer.
Sir David Alliance, the chairman whose family holds 58 per cent of the
company, said that, although N Brown had been pipped to the acquisition of
Country Holidays, a direct seller of country cottage holidays, the company
had 'no real need to buy'. It was also 'watching developments' on the TV
shopping front, although Sir David reckoned it would not be important this
decade.
N Brown recently received the results of a two-year project undertaken by
the University of Manchester to ascertain the changing shape of women. Among
the conclusions of the survey, which took 30,000 measurements from more than
700 women, were that they had grown bigger and wider, and had figures more
conical than hour-glass shaped.
Mr Martin said that this information was being fed into Brown's catalogues
and he hoped it would reduce the number of items returned.
Home shopping operating profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 11.9m on turnover
up 15 per cent to Pounds 95.2m. Within that, the core catalogues for the
mature woman accounted for 84 per cent and lifted sales by 10 per cent.
However, Fashion World and Candid, for younger women, had sales growth of 31
per cent. This represented 14 per cent of divisional turnover.
Greater efficiencies offset the Pounds 1m launch costs of Classic
Combination, which accounted for 2.3 per cent of turnover and lost just
Pounds 200,000. It should move into the black next year.
Earnings rose to 4.97p (4.15p) per share and the interim dividend is raised
20 per cent to 1.35p (1.125p). The shares fell 4p to 240p. With the City
looking for Pounds 26.5m pre-tax for the full year, they are trading on a
multiple of 19.5.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pentos Pounds 36m in the red after
exceptional costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pentos, the specialist retailing group which is undergoing a restructuring
under its new management, reported a Pounds 36m pre-tax loss for the half
year to July 2 after exceptional costs of Pounds 10.5m. There were restated
losses of Pounds 10.6m last time.
Commenting on the results Mr Bill McGrath, who took over as chief executive
in January, said they 'should mark a low point in Pentos' fortunes'. He
added that 'considerable progress' had been made in implementing strategic
initiatives and refocusing the group since receiving the proceeds of its
Pounds 45m rescue rights issue in May.
Mr McGrath emphasised that the group's management was only able to focus
fully on implementing the initiatives after receipt of the rights proceeds
and accordingly the results 'do not reflect any of the resulting benefits'.
Turnover of continuing operations increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 97.9m
(Pounds 91.5m) including a 2 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at
Dillons, the flagship bookstore chain. The group also includes Ryman
stationers and Athena Galleries, the cards and poster chain.
The exceptional costs cover a number of items, including Pounds 5.7m related
to Dillons to cover a more accurate determination of year-end creditors,
provisions for prior year debtors, under-accrued property costs and
redundancy costs of Pounds 400,000 which Mr McGrath said should result in
full-year savings of Pounds 2m.
Operating losses widened to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 7.4m) before unchanged
interest charges of Pounds 3.2m. Mr McGrath said the losses were
attributable to a number of factors including accounting changes and the
fact that before the rights issue many suppliers were reluctant to supply
stock.
Dillons sales rose 7 per cent to Pounds 57.5m and trading losses were Pounds
13m before exceptional charges. Ryman reported a Pounds 3.8m loss on flat
sales from continuing operations of Pounds 16.7m while Athena's loss on
continuing activities was Pounds 5m on static sales of Pounds 16.2m.
Losses per share were 17.2p (6.4p) and the interim dividend is again passed.
COMMENT
The latest exceptional costs, while unexpectedly high, should mark an end to
the house cleaning at Pentos. Meanwhile the rights issue has enabled the
group to re-establish good relations with is suppliers and begin rebuilding
the balance sheet which shows bank borrowings of Pounds 62.3m at the end of
the first half. Looking ahead, Mr McGrath believes Dillons can continue to
grow its market share which has recovered from a low of 31.5 per cent in
June, and is well positioned to take advantage of the likely demise of the
net book agreement. Managers are now under instructions to build sales.
Barring the unexpected, the group should break even in the second half.
Those still holding the shares which slipped  1/2 p to 14p yesterday, should
hang on.

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: FR ahead 17% and proposes name change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FR Group, the aerospace engineering company, yesterday reported a 17 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits and said it wanted to change its name to
reflect the whole of the group's activities.
Paradoxically, the proposed name change to Cobham coincided with news of the
planned retirement next June of Mr Michael Cobham, who will by then have
been chairman of the Dorset-based company for 26 years.
FR said its present name was identified too strongly with Flight Refuelling,
the air-to-air refuelling business which accounts for about 40 per cent of
group sales, to the detriment of other divisions.
Sir Alan Cobham - the present chairman's father - founded Flight Refuelling
60 years ago and the group said the name Cobham had a long and well
established association with the industry.
Mr Gordon Page, chief executive, said there were no more members of the
Cobham family involved with the group, but this seemed an appropriate time
to make the change - partly because this year is the centenary of Sir Alan's
birth.
The new chairman will be Sir Michael Knight, 61, a non-executive director,
who joined the board in 1990. He retired as Air Chief Marshall in 1989 after
35 years' service with the Royal Air Force.
FR's pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 12.3m in the six
months to June 30, on sales up 16 per cent at Pounds 101m. The shares closed
up 12p at 290p.
Mr Page said the group had made good progress by 'sticking to its knitting'.
The order book stood at Pounds 280m at the period end, and was both
long-term and well spread across the group's businesses.
Having cut several hundred jobs in the previous year, Mr Page said that FR
had shed only 40 to 50 jobs in the half-year, and benefited from stable
buying programmes from Airbus and Fokker.
Last month FR paid Pounds 6.7m for Sargent Fletcher, a California-based
supplier of air-to-air refuelling equipment to the US Navy. Mr Page said the
company was well placed to win a Pentagon contract to install aerial
refuelling wing pods on its KC 135 tanker aircraft, which could be worth
Dollars 100m (Pounds 63m) over 10 years.
FR generated cash of Pounds 8.8m during the first half and had net cash of
Pounds 3m at the period end. Earnings came out at 11.01p (9.08p) per share
and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.7p (2.46p).

FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rumours spark Asprey share tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Asprey fell 17p to 135p yesterday amid market rumours about the
financial position of the jewellery retailer, writes Peter Pearse.
On September 9, the shares plummeted from 310p to 200p after a warning that
the loss of a few big-spending customers would depress its profits.
Yesterday Asprey said it was forced to put out a statement to the Stock
Exchange asserting that the 'rumours are without basis in fact'. It said
that there were three rumours it wished to deny. First, the company had one
bad debtor, owing some Pounds 30m. Second, it would have to make a Pounds
40m write-off for stock. Thirdly, it would not be able to pay its preference
dividend.
Asprey responded that at its most recent review, it had stock of Pounds
150m. The next review is at the time of the interim results and it did not
expect that 'further provisions, if any, will be material in the context of
the value of the stock as a whole'.
It said it had never had a 'material bad debt' in its history as a public
company. It added that nothing had altered since the profits warning to
change its view of the upcoming results for the six months to September 30.
It therefore expects to pay the preference.

FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Goodman and bankers are close to
agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MACMANUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Larry Goodman, the Irish beef entrepreneur, is close to an agreement to
buy back the outstanding 60 per cent of Goodman International which he lost
when it was taken over by its banks as part of a rescue deal four years ago.
Mr Goodman and his backers are understood to have offered the 33 banks in
the Goodman syndicate, led by Lloyds Bank, up to IPounds 50m (Pounds 49m) in
settlement of debts in excess of IPounds 300m.
Goodman International has declined to comment on the negotiations other than
to say they are extremely complex and it hopes they will be successfully
completed by the end of November.
Under the proposed deal Mr Goodman's stake in the company would initially
fall from 40 to 35 per cent, but he is likely to have the option to buy back
most of the remaining shares. He will remain managing director.
Morgans Waterfall, a US 'vulture fund' specialising in high-risk
investments, is believed to be prepared to take a stake of up to 25 per cent
in the restructured company, while a group of Irish investors, based outside
the Republic, are expected to take up to 12 per cent. Morgans Waterfall has
refused to comment on the proposed investment.
Other Irish investors are due to participate, including the McCann family
who are also shareholders in Fyffes, the fruit and vegetable distributor.
Fyffes itself has ruled out taking a stake.
Klesch and Co, the London-based debt trader, has confirmed that it is also
involved in the buy-back. The deal is expected to involve a mechanism by
which Mr Goodman can increase his stake by buying out the other investors.
The new investors are expected to get representation on Goodman's board. Mr
John O'Donnell, finance director, is expected to remain, as is Mr Ian
Morrison, the chairman and a former governor of the Bank of Ireland.
Two agreements have to be hammered out between the would-be investors and
the banks. One will cover the exit mechanism for the banks, the other the
provision of banking facilities for Goodman. Up to 10 of the banks in the
consortium are expected to provide it with a working capital facility of
about IPounds 100m to cover the peak of the cattle slaughtering season.
Goodman and the banks have already reached agreement on the distribution of
the company's contingent assets should any be realised. Goodman is, for
instance, owed IPounds 175m by the Iraqi government for beef exported prior
to the Gulf war.
The company, Ireland's largest beef processor and one of the largest in
Europe, went into examination - the Irish equivalent of administration  - in
1990, owing its banks more than IPounds 500m.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Chrysler up to Dollars 651m as demand soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the smallest of the three big US carmakers, reported a 54 per cent
jump in profits for the latest quarter as demand for the company's most
popular models in North America continued to outstrip supply.
The company's after-tax earnings of Dollars 651m, or Dollars 1.60 a share
fully diluted, compared with Dollars 423m, or Dollars 1.04, a year before,
about Dollars 100m ahead of Wall Street estimates. The news raised optimism
about the North American car market and lifted the shares of rivals General
Motors and Ford. The three are expected to report total net income of about
Dollars 2bn - more than three times the level of a year ago.
Chrysler said it expected demand in the US and Canada to remain strong for
the next two years, in spite of the potential dampening of consumer demand
caused by the rise in US interest rates this year.
Mr Thomas Capo, treasurer, said: 'We believe there has been a lot of pent-up
demand in the North American car business over the past couple of years,'
and that meeting this demand would sustain sales at higher levels for some
time.
The strong sales strengthened Chrysler's balance sheet, reinforcing its
position as the most financially secure of the big three. 'It's the world
turned upside down,' said Mr David Healy, analyst at SG Warburg in New York.
'Three or four years ago, they (Chrysler) were the weak one, and GM was the
tower of strength.'
The third-quarter jump in profits came on the back of Dollars 11.7bn in
sales, up from Dollars 9.7bn a year before. Vehicles sold rose 15 per cent
to 593,757. Due to demand, the incentives offered for each vehicle sold fell
to Dollars 520, from about Dollars 600 in the second quarter and Dollars 775
a year ago.
The advance stems in part from the fact that some of its newer models are
category leaders. Its Jeep Grand Cherokee, one of the most sought-after
four-wheel drive vehicles, is 'literally sold out', Mr Capo said. Chrysler
is adding a third shift next month to lift production.
Inventory levels of the Grand Cherokee had fallen to 23 days' supply by the
end of September, with fewer in dealers' showrooms, he said. Inventory of
the Jeep Wrangler fell to 27 days and the Neon, the company's
biggest-selling small car, to 34 days. This compares with normal inventory
levels at Chrysler of 60 days for cars and 70 days for trucks.
The company said it would add capacity for a further 500,000 vehicles over
the next year. However, since this will come mainly from adding additional
shifts or retooling, it would add little to fixed costs and only 30,000
vehicles a year to the company's break-even level.

FT  12 OCT 94 / VSEL poised to accept BAe offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The agreed takeover of the submarine maker VSEL by British Aerospace is
likely to be concluded this week. Barring any last minute hitch, VSEL's
board will recommend that its shareholders accept an offer of BAe shares
valuing VSEL at about Pounds 12.50 a share.
GEC, the other potential bidder for the Barrow, Cumbria-based shipbuilding
company, has not said whether it intends to counter BAe's paper offer with
an alternative cash bid. GEC had considered buying VSEL and decided not to
bid.
It is understood that GEC's ownership of the Yarrow shipyard on the Clyde
would provoke competition concerns from the Ministry of Defence. A bid by
BAe, which does not own a yard, is not thought to raise such concerns.
The maximum City observers expect BAe to have offered is three BAe shares
for each VSEL share, though the company may offer slightly less. The deal
will involve increasing the number of BAe shares in issue by a third.
VSEL had a cash pile of Pounds 325m at March 31 this year, about Pounds 240m
of which was the company's own money and the balance advance payments from
the MoD for work in progress. The cash pile equates to 850p a share, of
which the company's own funds account for 640p a share.
The cash pile would significantly reduce BAe's debt at June 30 of Pounds
367m, and the all-share takeover is being viewed by some as a disguised
rights issue.
The deal will strengthen BAe's balance sheet and cut its borrowings.
However, because VSEL has such a large cash pile the deal will also
significantly increase BAe's earnings from the first year. Total Trident
submarine cash profits could exceed Pounds 450m, almost the full cost of the
deal.
BAe has stressed its interest in expanding its expertise in co-ordinating
large defence contracts from aircraft to other systems. A Pounds 2.5bn
contract for the next batch of up to five Trafalgar-class hunter-killer
submarines is due to be awarded in the next 18 months, and the combined
BAe-VSEL team would be a favourite to win.
VSEL has teamed up with Loral, the US electronics company, to bid for the
Trafalgars. But if BAe replaces Loral it could use its systems integration
and electronics skills to help secure the deal.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Tiphook's lead banks named in US suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank and Commerzbank, the two largest lenders to the
transport leasing group Tiphook, have been drawn into a Dollars 700m (Pounds
443m) US class action suit against the company.
The lawsuit claims the banks helped to mislead US investors to enable
Tiphook to raise capital to repay loans. Two former non-executive directors,
Sir Charles Powell, Lady Thatcher's former foreign affairs adviser and now a
non-executive director of NatWest, and Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, Commerzbank's
chairman, are also named as defendants, as representatives of those banks.
The move appears to be an attempt to achieve a larger and quicker
settlement, as Tiphook's financial standing is in effect controlled by its
banks.
The original legal action was filed in January on behalf of US investors who
took up three tranches of bond issues between November 1992 and April 1993,
raising Dollars 700m for the company. The named defendants included Mr
Robert Montague, Tiphook's chief executive and founder, several executive
directors, and the underwriters to the bond issues. The investors claim they
were sold Tiphook bonds and shares on the basis of 'materially false and
misleading' information.
Sir Charles and Mr Kohlhaussen resigned 'with regret' from Tiphook on March
10. Legal reasons were cited, connected to Tiphook's new bank arrangements,
but there were previous potential conflicts of interest, as their banks were
the prime recipients of the funds raised.
The action claims: 'Tiphook's lead lenders were represented on Tiphook's
board of directors by their own senior directors and were thus aware of the
true distressed condition of the company. These lenders pressured the
company to repay Tiphook's bank indebtedness to these institutions with
indebtedness financed by unsuspecting public investors in the United
States.' An initial status and settlement conference on the case has been
called for October 18, to set the timetable for the proceedings.
Tiphook has consistently stated that the accusations will be 'vigorously
contested'. The two banks would not comment.
The bond prospectuses anticipated, among other things, easy continued access
to capital, strong cash flows, and 'the best Christmas in two years'.
The first signs of declining fortunes came just six days after the final
prospectus, when Tiphook announced that interim profits would be 20 per cent
below previously projected results.
A stream of bad news then leaked out and by October 1993 it had indicated
possible breaches of its banking covenants.
Tiphook has made provisions to cover its legal defence, but an adverse
judgment could topple the company into receivership.
Mr Montague was served with a bankruptcy petition from Royal Bank of
Scotland on Monday night, over a Pounds 2.3m loan. If made bankrupt, he
would be ineligible as a director.
Mr Montague is hoping for support from the bulk of his creditors to push for
an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, which would schedule debt repayment,
and avoid bankruptcy.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Subtle benefits from a rebalancing act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Buying bonds will raise pension scheme costs, calculate actuaries grappling
with the implications of the proposed UK minimum solvency standard. Over the
past few decades equities have achieved a rate of return averaging 5.5 per
cent a year more than gilt-edged.
That is why the equity exposure of UK schemes has drifted up to more than 80
per cent. This makes company pension plans cheap to run, according to
conventional actuarial assumptions. But the trend has exposed scheme members
to greater discontinuance risks, which have aroused political scrutiny.
So here is an interesting question. Suppose at the beginning of 1986 a
pension fund with the then typical equity exposure of 74 per cent (excluding
property) had decided to fix at a 50:50 mix of equities and bonds, to be
rebalanced every quarter. How much worse would it have performed up to March
1994 than the typical fund which allowed its asset mix to drift with the
superior performance of equities? (The drifting mix, incidentally, would
have finished with about 78 per cent in equities, which was in the event
further lifted by 9 percentage points by eager fund managers.)
The answer, according to First Quadrant, the quantitative investment
management firm, is that the 50:50 mix would have produced a slightly better
return, at 14.4 per cent against 14.0 per cent, and with lower volatility.
Why should a mechanistic process such as periodical rebalancing to a
benchmark have this beneficial result? The answer is that the rebalancing
procedure acts as a counter to valuation distortions between the two asset
classes and forces the fund to offset them. When equities become expensive
relative to bonds the equities are capped, and a small profit taken.
Similarly when bonds are expensive relative to equities. It is a kind of
automated contrarian approach, with a ratchet-like effect.
For quantitative managers such as First Quadrant, an offshoot of the Xerox
Corporation, the approaching minimum solvency standard offers an opportunity
to break into the UK pension fund market, at present dominated by balanced
managers. Ideas such as rebalancing are common in the US but are largely
ignored in the consensus-chasing British market.
But British pension fund trustees have proved unreceptive to quantitative
methods so far. Perhaps balanced management has taken the drifting mix
further towards risk than the trustees would have wished to go, but the
results have been good.
The trouble with quantitative methods is that it would be tough to find
excuses if they were to go wrong. The trustees might have to confess that
they had not understood what they were buying. It might not be enough simply
to blame external managers.
What could go wrong? Take the simple question of rebalancing to a benchmark.
One reason why it has worked so well since 1986 is that the extra return on
equities has not been 5.5 per cent during this period, but only 2.5 per
cent. That relative decline in equity return will be the subject for another
article, but the point here is that the penalty for high bond exposure has
been small in recent years. Over longer periods drift has beaten
rebalancing, but often not by a large margin.
The obvious problem with rebalancing is that, as with any contrarian
approach, it will often be uncomfortable. The fund's trustees will have to
be willing to bet against the crowd for periods which may not be very long
but will certainly seem so. If the return differential between equities and
bonds were to widen, perhaps because of unanticipated inflation, the
drifters would win.
Finally, the capturing of profits from rebalancing depends on the existence
of volatility in the relative valuations of the asset classes. Low
volatility - that is, persistent trends - would make rebalancing costlier.
UK pension funds have to come to grips with strategies which pay attention
to the liability side of their balance sheets, rather than being driven by
historical returns or peer group emulation.
At least First Quadrant's study provides hope that matching liabilities more
precisely against safe assets may not prove as expensive as often feared.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Barings bucks the trend with 54% first-half rise: 'We chose
the right things to do and avoided the wrong things'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barings yesterday bucked the trend among UK merchant banks by reporting a 54
per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 35.5m to Pounds 54.8m in
the half year to June 30. The advance contrasted with lower first-half
profits reported last week by SG Warburg and signalled by Hambros.
Mr Peter Baring, group chairman, said: 'This is a very satisfactory result
in much more difficult market conditions than those of 1993.' He added: 'I'm
conscious that we have had a very good 18-month period and, life being what
it is, you can't maintain that.'
However, one analyst described the results as 'the best of the sector from
any company of any size'. The first-half performance puts Barings in a
strong position to exceed the Pounds 100.1m full-year profit before tax it
achieved in 1993.
Barings reported a strong performance in corporate finance, lifted by the
role advising Lloyds Bank on its proposed acquisition of Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society. Income from fees and commissions rose 47 per
cent to Pounds 238.8m.
Barings, like Warburg and Hambros, described market conditions as
'turbulent' but said its money market and fixed income businesses had 'coped
well'. Net dealing income, which fell at other banks, grew 16 per cent to
Pounds 63.6m. The company suffered relatively little because its main
securities broking business is in Asia rather than North America and western
Europe.
Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank subsidiary,
said a third of employees were based in Asia and the region provided a
similar proportion of profits.
Mr Tuckey described Barings' involvement in bonds, where the market has
fallen sharply since the start of the year, as 'specialised and modest'.
Dillon Read, the US investment bank of which the group owns 40 per cent,
produced lower profits in the first half but Barings noted that the
performance was significantly better than many of its counterparts on Wall
Street.
A rival UK banker said the contrast between Barings' results and those of
Warburg and Hambros owed much to 'a different mix of businesses'.
Mr Baring said Barings had avoided markets where losses were made recently
and those in mature economies where competition between market makers was
tough. 'I think we chose the right things to do and avoided the wrong
things,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Games of chance set up Nobel prize in economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three academics from the US, Germany and Hungary won the Nobel economics
prize yesterday for their work deriving economic lessons from the dynamics
of games.
The winners are Dr John C. Harsanyi, born in Budapest and now at the
University of California at Berkeley, Dr John F. Nash, of Princeton
University, and Dr Reinhard Selten, now at the University of Bonn. They are
the first economists to win the prize from the field of 'game theory', one
of the biggest trends in economics of the past 30 years.
Game theorists draw on games such as poker to build models of situations in
which people may base their decisions on how they expect others to react.
Work by yesterday's winners has since been applied to everything from
corporate pricing strategy to international disarmament talks.
All three theorists tend to express their ideas in complex mathematical
models. But the basic themes are relatively simple. A Nash equilibrium,
formulated by Dr Nash in 1951, defines stalemate in a 'non- co-operative'
game.
In poker, this would mean that each player would make the same bid, even if
they could see everyone else's cards, and knew what everyone else was going
to bid. Nothing that a player could do would affect the other players' bids.
Dr Harsanyi stretched the concept to situations in which some players know
more than others; for example, where one person might look at another
player's hand. He also pointed out that games might be expected to run more
smoothly if everybody agreed on the rules at the start.
Dr Selten took game theory a step further, showing how players' behaviour
might change if they knew they were going to play again the next day. He
also contributed the 'chain-store paradox', which helps to explain why
well-known, profitable players may be willing to lose a lot of money to
scare off minor competition, if it helps to stop others from trying the same
thing.
Together, the three economists have helped to show that many problems can be
construed as games.
Work continues on applying these techniques to real life.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Soldier's kidnap halts Israeli talks with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Israel suspended peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation
yesterday and sealed off the Gaza Strip following the kidnapping of an
Israeli soldier by Islamic militants who threatened to kill him.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, telephoned Mr Yassir Arafat,
the PLO leader, and held him responsible for the safe return of the soldier,
Corporal Nachshon Waxman, who was kidnapped by the fundamentalist Hamas
group.
The head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks in Cairo, where
negotiations are under way over Palestinian elections, was recalled. In
Jerusalem Mr Rabin held talks wiith security officials and an emergency
cabinet session was called for today.
The incident, which comes amid reports that Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin are to
receive the Nobel Peace Prize, marks one of the most serious political
crises since Palestinian autonomy was established in May after Israel pulled
out of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. It follows warnings by
Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat to crack down on Islamic fundamentalists, who oppose
peace with the Jewish state.
Mr Arafat has refrained from confronting the fundamentalists, fearing that
any attempt to disarm them or arrest their leaders would result in a civil
war.
Hamas said it would kill the soldier unless Israel released a number of
Moslem militant leaders being held prisoner by Friday.
Mr Rabin's office warned that 'any harm to the soldier kidnapped by the
Hamas or delay in the return of the soldier is likely to have a very
detrimental effect on the future relations between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority, and the continuation of the peace process'.
'This is the true test for the Palestinian Authority,' Mr Rabin told Mr
Arafat. It was the second time that Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip,
barring Palestinian workers from getting to their jobs in Israel, since
autonomy began. The move puts additional pressure on Mr Arafat as the 50,000
workers are the main breadwinners for the impoverished coastal strip.
In Gaza, Mr Arafat condemned the kidnapping and accused Hamas of
provocation. He spoke to the parents of the kidnapped soldier and promised
to do his best to win the release of their son, said his spokesman, Mr Nabil
Abuirdeineh.
Israel radio reported that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state
who is brokering peace between Israel and Syria, telephoned both Mr Rabin
and Mr Arafat over the developments.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Software companies offer rewards in anti-piracy drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading software companies are offering rewards of up to Pounds 2,500 to
informers prepared to shop companies in the UK illegally copying software,
in a bid to crackdown on piracy estimated tohave cost them nearly Pounds
333m last year.
The British are law-abiding compared with the French and the Spanish when it
comes to software piracy in Europe, according to the Business Software
Alliance (BSA), which represents software groups including Microsoft, Novell
and Lotus.
It claims that Spanish companies pay for hardly any of the software they
use, with the piracy rate - in the form of applications copied illegally -
last year equal to 88 per cent of software consumed.
Piracy rates are calculated by comparing hardware sales and average software
consumption against payments for software. France, it says, has a piracy
rate of 66 per cent of consumption, while in Britain the rate is 49 per
cent, with only Austria and Switzerland having better records in the
European league.
Italy used to be a piracy black spot, but the BSA says it is reforming. Its
piracy rate has dropped sharply - to 50 per cent last year from 86 per cent
in 1992. The BSA attributes the change to new copyright legislation, not a
reform of public morals in the wake of political corruption scandals.
Piracy rates are calculated by comparing hardware sales and average software
consumption against payments for software.
To counter piracy in the UK, the alliance is offering rewards of up to
Pounds 2,500 for information leading to successful prosecutions.
The alliance is encouraging staff to phone a piracy hotline if they believe
their company is using illegally copied software. With only a tiny number of
successful prosecutions to date, it hopes that rewards will have the same
impact in the UK as in Australia, where the introduction of rewards for
informers led to six successful prosecutions within six months.
Mr Evan Cox, BSA's European counsel, said: 'Software theft continues to
plague the industry: the software crimeline is going to hit thieves very
hard.'
Piracy in Europe is far lower than in parts of the world with lax copyright
or enforcement rules. According to the alliance, four countries had a 99 per
cent piracy rate last year: Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and the United
Arab Emirates.
The 1992 EU software directive designed to outlaw software piracy has led to
the tightening of copyright laws in many European countries. But policing
the copying of software is a big problem for suppliers.
The BSA says that in North America the industry lost Pounds 1.6bn last year
through piracy, and in Asia losses totalled Pounds 2.6bn. In Europe, the
figure was Pounds 3.2bn.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Sanofi
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sanofi's sale of its bio-industries and rendering businesses to Viag of
Germany kills two birds with one stone. It constitutes a strategic
withdrawal from a low margin activity, at a fair price of 0.9 times sales
and 12.5 times operating profits. It is also a logical move following the
French group's acquisition in July of Sterling Drug's pharmaceutical
activities. The purpose of that transaction was to give new direction to a
group whose lack of focus had been heavily penalised by investors.
Management then promised to finance the purchase with asset sales; had these
not taken place there would have been further damage to the group's
credibility. As it is, the Sterling deal is now likely to enhance earnings
by next year, as Sanofi forces through cost-savings in the area of overlap
with its existing pharmaceutical business. The resulting earnings momentum
should help tide Sanofi over until a new generation of promising drugs comes
on stream in two to three years' time.
Viag's desire to diversify is less easy to understand. It has no existing
interest in bio-industries or rendering, and one might have expected it to
be busy enough digesting Bayernwerk, the recently acquired Bavarian utility.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Amersham/Sumitomo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The logic behind yesterday's first step by Amersham towards a
radio-pharmaceuticals joint-venture with Sumitomo Chemical is convincing.
The deal fills Amersham's strategic gap in the world's second largest
market, which is expanding at 15 per cent a year. It gives the British group
local manufacturing and distribution, important in Japan where physicians
prefer prescribing a particular form of product that has an especially short
shelf-life and so cannot be imported. Access to the fruits of Sumitomo's R&amp;D
efforts could eventually prove handy. At a maximum of 26 times historic
earnings, the price does not seem steep for a Japanese company.
Such deals are not easy in Japan. Amersham has limited any risks by taking
particular care to smooth the venture with its established partner Chugai.
The transaction is also a feather in the cap for Morgan Stanley. Investment
bankers have been attempting to tie up such deals for many years. Few have
succeeded.
For Sumitomo, the move is good news after a run of bad. Sales of Sumiferon,
its top-selling interferon, have tumbled since March when the government
warned that the drug could cause severe depression and then cut the
medicine's price by 19.5 per cent. The recent decisions by SmithKline
Beecham, Zeneca and Upjohn to dissolve their respective joint ventures with
Sumitomo have also wounded. Although Amersham's link-up is to be welcomed,
it does not secure the long term future of the pharmaceuticals subsidiary.
Sumitomo Chemical may be a giant, but its drugs wing remains a
pharmaceuticals pigmy. Other Western companies looking to increase their
presence in Japan might consider approaching the group to forge a more
permanent alliance.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Barings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 54 per cent jump in Barings' first quarter results prompts the question
whether they must know something which a struggling Warburg does not.
Perhaps the secret of success in investment banking is to eschew
market-making in securities, focus on lucrative niches and steer clear of
low-margin businesses. But such a strategy has long been closed to a bank of
Warburg's size. It is also easy to exaggerate Barings' triumph. The mere
fact that it has had a good first half, helped incidentally by the fees from
a number of one-off deals such as the 3i flotation, does not say much for
the quality of its earnings.
Barings' profits have fluctuated wildly in recent years, from Pounds 66m in
1989 to Pounds 21m in 1992 and Pounds 100m last year. Nor is net return on
capital outstanding at slightly over 20 per cent. Barings itself admits the
need for a higher return to compensate for the volatility of its profits
flow.
Here, it becomes just like any other merchant bank. It must be continuously
on the look-out for new high margin business, even in the emerging markets
in which it specialises, and it must remain on its guard against rising
costs. Administrative expenses rose 33 per cent in the first half, which
partly reflects the sunk costs of its emerging market network. Barings
assumes its return will improve as that investment continues to come good.
If so, its strategy will be vindicated. If not, and bond markets eventually
recover, a fickle City might one day end up lavishing praise instead on
Warburg for its clever skills on proprietary trading.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Chrysler cruises ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Of the big three US car manufacturers, Chrysler was the one deemed most
likely to collapse during the last recession. But the company was so
successful in responding to the crisis that it quickly evolved into
investors' favoured stock in the sector. Its shares have outperformed the
market by a factor of three in so many years, and the automotive sector by
100 per cent.
The out-performance of Chrysler's shares, along with that of Ford and
General Motors, came to a halt early this year; since then the shares have
fallen back sharply amid worries about rising interest rates and the scale
of recovery in the US car market. Yesterday's record third quarter results
from Chrysler reflect the impact of good luck and good management - good
luck because Chrysler is traditionally strong in the buoyant sports utility
segment of the market, good management because of the group's success in
introducing new models such as the Neon and the Grand Cherokee at the right
point in the cycle.
The figures also raise the question as to whether the correction in US auto
share prices has been premature. True, history suggests that automotive
stocks should be sold well before the cyclical peak. But that peak now looks
more distant than was thought earlier. Analysts now predict the turn in US
car sales will not come until well into 1996. A small further increase in
interest rates will hit investor sentiment, but is not likely lead to a
material downturn in sales. Thus US car manufacturers look undervalued on a
multiple of six times consensus earnings for next year, a discount of more
than 50 per cent to the market as a whole.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Retailers' global shopping spree: With domestic growth
opportunities in decline, stores groups are expanding abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Before the decade is out, the biggest company in the world by turnover may
not be a carmaker, an oil company or a computer manufacturer; it could be a
retailer.
Wal-Mart, the world's biggest stores group, is forecast to increase sales
from Dollars 67bn last year to Dollars 84bn (Pounds 53bn) this year and more
than Dollars 100bn next year. This would put it among the world's top 10
companies - and if this growth rate continued, Wal-Mart could overtake
industrial giants such as General Motors and Exxon to become the world's
biggest company by the millennium.
Much of this growth will come outside Wal-Mart's US base. In the past year,
the company has acquired 100 stores in Canada, begun building 40 stores in
Mexico and formed a joint venture in Hong Kong from which it will expand
into China. It has also announced plans to move into Argentina and Brazil,
and is thought to be planning to enter Singapore, Chile and Europe.
Other retailers are following Wal-Mart in expanding internationally -
evidence of the growing globalisation of the retail industry. Until
recently, many stores groups were discouraged from expanding abroad by the
potential pitfalls of appealing to different cultures and tastes. In a world
of global manufacturers, there were few global retailers.
Some retailers have had well-publicised problems with their international
ventures. They include Dixons, the UK electrical stores group, with its
acquisition of the US Silo chain; Marks and Spencer, which made a costly
entry into the Canadian market; and France's Printemps, whose joint venture
in Japan almost went bankrupt.
The picture is changing, however. Retailers are showing a new appetite for
international ventures, and the ability to carry them off. This opens up the
prospect of rapid growth for those that succeed and harder times for weaker
chains used to competing only against familiar, national rivals.
'If you were to list half a dozen key retailing issues for the 1990s,
internationalisation would be near the top,' says Mr George Wallace, chief
executive of the UK-based retail consultancy, Management Horizons.
He adds that the publicity that has surrounded the problem cases has
obscured the extent to which some retailers have successfully made their
business more international since the 1980s. France's Promodes and
Carrefour, Germany's Aldi and Tengelmann, Belgium's Delhaize, and Ahold of
the Netherlands have increased the proportion of their turnover that comes
from outside domestic markets through acquisitions and growth - to 70 per
cent in the case of Delhaize.
Last week, J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest food retailer, made its second
foray into the US, buying 50 per cent of voting shares in Giant Food, the
Washington DC-based supermarket group. Sainsbury's latest acquisition,
combined with its purchase in 1987 of Shaw's, the New England chain, makes
the UK group the 11th largest grocer in the US.
Other retailers have operations spread over so many countries that they can
already be considered global. These include clothes retailer Benetton of
Italy, Sweden's home furniture chain Ikea, Toys R Us of the US, UK clothes
and food retailer Marks and Spencer, and fast food group McDonald's.
Moreover, the pace of internationalisation by retailers is quickening. In a
recently published report, retail research group Corporate Intelligence says
European retailers made 610 cross-border moves in the first four years of
the 1990s - compared with 611 cross-border deals in the whole of the 1980s.
US retailers are also on the move, the group says. The number of US stores
groups operating in Europe is 45 today, up from 15 in 1991.
Retailers with international ambitions are also emerging from east Asia.
Japanese groups such as Sogo, Takashimaya and Yaohan, which have spread
across Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand, are now coming to the west.
This wave of internationalisation has been prompted by a combination of
'push' and 'pull' factors, according to Mr Giles Elliott, a director of
Schroders merchant bank, and Mr Michael Poynor, of strategic consultancy
Coba, who have advised retailers on international expansion.
The biggest 'push' factor, they say, is saturation of domestic markets.
While there is room for expansion at home, retailers have no need to look
abroad, but that option is fast disappearing.
In the UK, for example, retail chains' share of the food retailing market
jumped from 49 per cent in 1973 to 80 per cent by 1992, according to market
research group AGB. A similar pattern can be seen in countries such as
France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
With such levels of dominance at home, companies are moving into countries
with less developed retail markets, or buying existing chains in developed
markets.
The so-called 'pull' factors include the falling barriers to entry into
markets worldwide. The creation of a single European market of 320m
consumers in 1992 allowed goods to be moved freely across pan-European
distribution networks. It has made Europe a much more attractive destination
for US - and Asian - retailers.
Another 'pull' factor is that retailers' suppliers are becoming more
international themselves. Manufacturers of consumer goods such as Unilever
are restructuring manufacturing operations on a pan-European basis, and
adopting international marketing campaigns. A symbol of this is the growing
importance of internationally recognised brand names in consumer goods,
electricals and consumer durables.
These 'push' and 'pull' factors, combined with increased foreign travel by
consumers and the spread of cross-border mass media such as satellite
television, are creating what Mr Wallace of retail consultancy Management
Horizons calls 'common denominators' in consumer tastes.
Mr Alan Lambert, Marks and Spencer's divisional director for continental
Europe, says that not only is there now a 'Euro-consumer' but also an
'international consumer' for its wares. 'Our best-selling products are the
same in London, Madrid or Hong Kong.'
However, local differences remain which retailers cannot neglect in
international moves. Says Mr Wallace: '15 years ago, companies plonked a few
shops down and hoped they would work. Now they take great care to analyse
the local situation and local markets.'
Some have found partnerships and joint ventures with local retailers the
best way to expand abroad. For example, M&amp;S formed a joint venture with
local retailer Cortefiel in Spain, which helped it to find sites, get to
know the market, and deal with local authorities.
Others such as Benetton, Body Shop and McDonald's have taken the franchising
path. The retailer supplies the product, the name, a tried-and-tested store
format and support systems, leaving local business people to run the stores.
In saturated markets such as the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Australia, there is limited scope for winning market share
through growth. The only retailers that can expect to do so are those that
are highly innovative in at least one aspect of their business: store
format, shopping environment, product quality or choice, customer service,
or systems and distribution methods. For others, acquisition of existing
groups is likely to be a better route.
In emerging markets, acquisition targets are limited, but organic growth
presents an exciting - if risky - opportunity. Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand
identifies 10 target markets for retailers, divided into the 'tough three',
the 'torrid three' and the 'formidable four'.
The 'tough three' - Italy, South Korea and Japan - are strong economies with
large middle classes, but where local restrictions have limited the degree
of concentration of retailing, and entry by foreign groups. With at least
some of the entry barriers expected to ease over the next few years, these
markets provide significant opportunities.
The 'torrid three' - experiencing rapid if volatile economic growth but with
an underdeveloped retail sector - are Mexico, Turkey and Argentina. These
offer even more exciting growth prospects than the 'tough three', but with a
moderate degree of economic risk.
The greatest political and economic risks are presented by the 'formidable
four' - Brazil, China, Russia and India - according to Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
They have a poor retail infrastructure, but offer retailers the most
exciting prospects, with rapidly growing middle classes hungry for consumer
goods.
Wal-Mart in Volgograd or Sainsbury in Shanghai may still be years away. But
one of the world's biggest but most localised industries is at last coming
to terms with the global marketplace.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Prize fighters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It's Nobel-tide again. The prize for medicine was awarded on Monday, that
for economics yesterday, and the peace prize is expected on Friday. As usual
the latter is causing the greatest controversy. According to apparently
authoritative leaks, it will go jointly to Yassir Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin.
One member of the awarding committee is said to be planning to resign in
protest, on the grounds that Mr Arafat is a former terrorist.
The row is as depressingly predictable as the choice. A terrorist past
should not in itself be a disqualification. Apart from the difficulty of
defining the term, it is true that those who make war are often best placed
to make peace.
No, the objection to Mr Arafat, as indeed to Mr Rabin, is that they are
established national leaders whose role in 'the peace process' has already
been recognised ad nauseam. If the committee has indeed chosen them, it has
acted true to the form which dictated such choices as de Klerk-Mandela
(1993), Begin-Sadat (1978) or Kissinger-Le Duc Tho (1973).
Several questions suggest themselves. What are Nobel prizes for? Why are
there three science prizes, one for literature, and one for peace, but none
for art, music, philosophy, psychology, or any of the social sciences except
(since 1968) economics? What are the credentials of those who award them?
And why does the world pay so much attention?
Some of the answers lie buried with Alfred Nobel, who endowed the prizes and
specified the bodies to award them in his will. On the whole those entrusted
with his legacy have interpreted it imaginatively, including astronomers
under physics, animal behaviourists under physiology, and historians
(notably Winston Churchill) under literature.
Inevitably, in making comparisons across such enormous fields, they have to
be subjective and sometimes appear capricious. Who can possibly be qualified
to set the merits of a Chinese poet against those of a Colombian novelist?
Yet the Swedish Academy was right to resist an early suggestion that only
Europeans be considered for the literature prize. Recent awards such as that
to the Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz in 1988 have helped to make the
western public aware that great literature is being produced in non-European
languages and cultures.
When the prizegivers err it is more by striving for objectivity or what is
now called political correctness than by eccentricity. They are at their
best when giving the peace prize to a figure who is still controversial or
embattled, as Martin Luther King was in 1964 and Andrei Sakharov in 1975; or
in recognising a scientist such as Georges Charpak (physics, 1992) whose
work on particle detection was hitherto little noticed, yet essential to
many flashier discoveries in related disciplines.
Scandinavian subjectivity is no worse than any other sort. Any attempt to
make the committees globally representative would certainly be the kiss of
death.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Russia's tragicomedian: Boris Yeltsin's antics could
backfire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin has long been attacked by Russia's nationalists and
communists as an unworthy upholder of democracy.
They have accused him of falsifying last December's referendum result to get
the constitution he wanted; and derided him for subsequently acting outside
that constitution to push through measures, such as privatisation, against
parliament's will.
But the disillusionment that is now taking hold among his supporters in
democratic and liberal circles is altogether more worrying.
That these new critics, from the core of his power base, are finding him
increasingly autocratic and unpredictable, bodes ill for his political
survival. However, more than Mr Yeltsin's reputation is being damaged by the
actions that have prompted their criticisms.
Russia's position on the world stage has been diminished by his recent
erratic behaviour on foreign trips. And the country's need for greater
domestic stability has hardly been served by the policy reversals that have
come with Mr Yeltsin's accommodation of his foes, at the expense of his
supporters.
Pro-reform ministers allege that presidential advisers are interfering or
even blocking them in their efforts to introduce more liberal policies,
while the president is ignoring appeals to sack those accused of corruption
or authoritarian behaviour.
The president's long-serving (by Russian standards) press secretary, Mr
Vyacheslav Kostikov, last week warned that Mr Yeltsin was being tempted to
authoritarian measures by some of his more powerful and conservative aides -
especially Mr Victor Iliushin, head of his sec-retariat.
Two former aides - Mr Genady Burbulis, once his right hand man and first
deputy prime minister (in 1992), and Mrs Galina Starovoitova, former adviser
on nationalities - have both called for the democratic movement to distance
itself from him. Mr Burbulis said that there could be no question of Mr
Yeltsin running again after his term expires in 1996 and that the greatest
problem for democrats was to support him in ending his present term with
dignity.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, who twice worked with Mr Yeltsin as finance minister,
last weekend called for liberals to pass into opposition, since the
administration was now becoming more communist than democratic.
However, it has been the 'three embarrassments' of his recent foreign trips
that have brought to a head the attacks from both the opposition and the
president's former allies.
During the ceremony in Berlin to mark the withdrawal of Russian troops, Mr
Yeltsin grabbed the baton from the conductor of a police band and staged an
impromptu display of vigorous conducting and singing. In Washington, after
meetings with President Bill Clinton, he was decidedly over-boisterous. And
two weeks ago, he snubbed Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, when he
failed to descend from the aircraft at Shannon airport on his way back from
the US.
Comic in themselves, these incidents add up to a potentially terrifying
vision of a nuclear state's leader not in control of himself. They also
undermined the purpose of Mr Yeltsin's trip to the US, which was to
emphasise that Russia is a great power and should be seen as such.
Mr Yeltsin does represent a great power, but it is much weaker than the
superpower Soviet Union and getting weaker. His initiatives on the world
stage, including a proposal for deep nuclear cuts by the main nuclear powers
and a push to strengthen the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe at the expense of Nato, have had at best non-committal reactions from
the west. Were he stronger, he might command more attention for ideas which
are at least interesting.
At home, Izvestiya, once his most loyal ally in the press, has ripped into
him for the Germany incident, calling his behaviour 'our shame'. Communist
deputies repeated the charge on the opening of parliament last week. And Mr
Yegor Yakovlev, the veteran liberal journalist, sharpened the attack in his
Obshaya Gazeta last weekend.
Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the economic reformer who leads the Yabloko block and
has been running for the presidency for more than a year, says Mr Yeltsin is
a spent force: a man - who as he said himself in his recent presidential
memoir, A View from the Kremlin - wants no more than 'tranquillity' for
Russia.
Mr Yeltsin can hope for little tranquillity. This year's impressive fall in
inflation, achieved by slashing public expenditure, now looks like
unravelling after Mr Yeltsin announced, in late summer, Rbs4,200bn worth of
soft credits for the defence sector and for investment. The International
Monetary Fund is sceptical about a standby agreement this year, and though
foreign portfolio investment has gone up sharply, little of it has been in
the form of longer-term capital.
Last week, Mr Yeltsin said he would not seek to delay the June 1996
presidential election, but did not say if he would stand. Whether he does or
not, from now on the pressures on him will include those from the pretenders
to his chair.
No one really knows how resilient Mr Yeltsin will prove to be. For every
expert who knows he is a hopeless, even a fatally ill, alcoholic, there is
another who knows he is a strong if moody man, who likes a drink.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Leading Article: No prizes yet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is no Nobel prize for investment banking. But if there were, the
judges would have a problem in appraising the contenders - such are the
divergent theories in the industry about how to make durable profits.
The triumphant statement of half-year results issued yesterday by Barings,
the UK merchant bank, throws down a gauntlet to proponents of the theory of
integrated merchant banking.
Barings, which prides itself on focusing on the most lucrative markets, has
delivered much better results than those rivals, such as Warburg, which have
modelled themselves on the much larger US investment banks. The US banks
themselves, which have already disclosed disappointing profits for the
second quarter - in some case losses - are expected to show further
deterioration in the third-quarter figures which are now trickling out.
The current creed of integrated investment banking is that to compete for
high-margin business such as corporate advice, or placing of shares and
other securities in the market, a bank needs many tools. In particular, it
needs distributive power - the market presence to place those securities.
That, as some have interpreted the doctrine, means participation in
marketmaking, in proprietary trading, and in the latest fashions on the
newest markets such as derivatives.
An implication of that trend is that banks with more capital will have a
hefty advantage. They will be able better to withstand the turbulence of the
markets and to extract the maximum return from the riskiest products. If the
theory is correct, the middle ground occupied by medium-sized banks may
become increasingly uncomfortable.
The question raised by Barings' success is whether specialisation offers a
profitable alternative to integration for those banks that lack the capital
to compete in the top league.
Barings' figures, which showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.8m compared with
Pounds 35.5m in the first half last year, owe something to luck: it has had
relatively little exposure to some of the most turbulent areas this year,
notably the UK fixed-income market. It has also benefited from its
well-judged early entry into emerging markets, particularly in Asia.
The more important test of the strategy will be whether its out-performance
persists as bond markets recover, and as competition increases in Asia, and
whether it succeeds in winning corporate advisory contracts without the
appendages deemed necessary by its larger rivals.
The implication of Barings' results is that division of the investment
banking market is already well under way: into the giants, and the
specialised houses. If large scale or specialisation prove to be the best
recipes for lasting profits, banks in the middle will have either to find
more capital or to retreat from the most fiercely contested markets.

Who said resigning has gone out of fashion? Not in New Zealand it hasn't,
where Jeff Chapman has given up his job as auditor general, following TV
reports that he has defaulted on credit card payments of NZDollars 23,000
(about Pounds 8,850). The serious fraud office is also looking into dealings
involving up to NZDollars 60,000 of audit office funds.
Chapman was responsible for scrutinising the financial statements of
government departments, local authorities and most government-controlled
corporations, boards and companies. All over New Zealand, the sound of
calculators can be heard, clicking late into the night. . .

Good news for left-leaning oldies. Tony Blair has appointed an adviser older
than himself. Derek Scott, 47, who is married to Channel Four's political
editor Elinor Goodman and is one of BZW's economic boffins, has taken on a
job-share as Blair's economics adviser.
Scott, who will continue at BZW, is not known as one of the City's great
economics thinkers - but then who is? But he comes highly recommended by
Lord Healey, Labour's last chancellor. Scott was Healey's numbers man;
Healey says in his autobiography that Scott did him 'yeoman service because
he could argue with the Treasury without losing its confidence'.
Yeoman? We thought Blair was hiring praetorians. Still, they're all
spear-carriers, aren't they?

UK health science group seeks energetic executives with sporting expertise.
Good handicap essential.
Amersham International may have scored a hole-in-one through its link-up
yesterday with Sumitomo Chemical of Japan, but it has one problem - no
golfers on the board. 'Someone is going to have to learn,' says chief
executive Bill Castell, whose Japanese counterpart has a handicap of less
than 10.
But he shouldn't have too much of a problem. While the directors are golfing
duffers, the group has won the UK Pharmaceutical Golf Championships for two
years running. 'I'm amazed,' Castell adds. 'I don't know when the staff get

Cabinet ministers enjoy revealing new policies at the Conservative party
conference, even when the 'new' is actually just the old, dusted off a
little.
Yesterday at Bournemouth, transport secretary Brian Mawhinney gave literal
extension to that metaphor, by saying that vintage car owners will be
consulted over widening the application of vehicle excise duty to their old
jalopies.
As a vote-catching vehicle it looks a little rusty.

The appointment of Dalgety marketing whiz Jack Rowell - who also finds time
to manage England's rugby team - to the board of biotechnology company
Celsis reminds Observer of a bruising tale of corporate hospitality.
Celsis was founded by Ferrari-driving biotechnology mogul Chris Evans, whose
other passion is rugby. So devoted to the sport is Evans that he loses no
opportunity to take large groups of fund managers, investment analysts and
even journalists to a game. He also invites old chums from his home town of
Port Talbot, as well as a sprinkling of retired rugby stars.
The scheme backfired last season, when a party of 30 or so City types and
steel-workers descended on Cardiff for a match. Unfortunately their tickets
were dud; faces were as red as the Ferrari's paintwork as they were turned
away.

Observer doesn't want to deflate yesterday's excellent figures from Barings.
But they could have been better if it had played its cards right.
Some time ago Jardine Matheson, the ancient Hong Kong trading house, was
looking for a partner for a new Hong Kong merchant bank. Apparently, Barings
was offered the chance but let the idea slip. Robert Fleming stepped in. For
a total investment of less than Pounds 1m, Fleming now owns a half share in
the Far East's most profitable merchant bank. Jardine Fleming today
contributes about 40 per cent of Fleming's total profits, which were more
than double those of Barings last year.

Calling all philatelists. Watch out for a special issue from Italy on
November 21 which could be very short-lived. The Berlusconi government, as
if it didn't have bigger problems on its hands, has now approved a new stamp
depicting the philosopher Giovanni Gentile. Nothing wrong in that, surely?
Except that Gentile was hardly a gentle spirit. In fact, he joined Benito
Mussolini's fascist party, serving as minister of education between 1922-24,
eventually being murdered in 1944.
The stamp was ordered by the neo-fascist minister of post and
communications, Giuseppe Tatarella. Not surprisingly, the Italian Federation
of Partisan Associations and the National Association of Italian Partisans
have asked the ministry to withdraw the stamp.
Gentile would no doubt have loved all the fuss. An idealist philosopher, he
denied the existence of individual minds and of any distinction between past
and present. QED, eh?

FT  12 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mopping up the sleaze
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some years ago, it might not have seemed incongruous for a British minister
to boast of the unparalleled honesty of his country's politics. It does
today. No government can claim to be free of self-serving behaviour by
elected or appointed officials. But standards of public life in Britain have
fallen too far. Mr John Major should respond by exposing past corruption,
and acting to prevent future lapses.
Much of this is a matter of perception; some is proven wrongdoing.
Questionable individuals have donated large sums to the Conservative party.
Tory MPs have been willing to accept fees for asking parliamentary
questions. Ex-ministers have joined the boards of industries privatised by
their former offices, or moved to merchant banks that handled departmental
business. Trading in Anglia Television shares is believed not to have
profited Lord Archer personally, but he should further amplify his denials
of insider dealing.
Former public officials, sitting as executives of state-owned industries,
have become hugely enriched by privatisation. The network of quangos is
managed in dark secrecy by ministerial placemen and women; many are
redundant party functionaries or past donors to Conservative funds. Some are
thought to have put business in the way of companies they previously served.
The most dramatic accusations have arisen from arms deals. This week it has
been alleged that Mr Mark Thatcher, son of the then prime minister,
benefited from commissions paid to middlemen who brokered the Al Yamamah
arms deal with Saudi Arabia.
It is hardly surprising that 61 per cent of respondents to a Gallup poll in
the Daily Telegraph agreed that the Tories appear 'very sleazy and
disreputable'. Some of them are. Mr John Major cannot be responsible for
individual actions, but he must be seen to be aware of the problem, and act
to stop the rot. He could usefully begin with his predecessor.
If Mr Thatcher profited from the Saudi deal, the breach of rules for
ministerial behaviour would have been his mother's. She set up the deal; no
relation of hers should have profited. A public inquiry into the issue, as
demanded by Labour's Mr Robin Cook, would be impossibly laborious. But Mr
Major could publish the notes on Al Yamamah prepared by the then permanent
secretary at the ministry of defence, the National Audit Office report, and
other relevant documents. He could prevail upon Lady Thatcher to make a more
detailed statement than her brief assertion of probity this week.
He could tighten the rules of ministerial behaviour, both in office and
within a couple of years of leaving it, and legislate to make the
quangocracy transparent and accountable. He could subject appointments to
NAO scrutiny, hold all names on a publicly available national register, and
publish audited accounts of all relevant bodies. He could tighten executive
remuneration procedures in regulated utilities. Sleaze is a serious issue.
Mr Major must tackle it.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Blair's EU labours: A coherent Europe policy still eludes
the UK's main political parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Blair's spectacular debut as Labour leader has started the
modernisation of the party's antiquated thinking on domestic political
issues. In the process, he may well trigger a rethink of the domestic
political vocabulary of British politics at large. What he has not yet begun
to do is to extend this modernisation process to British thinking about
foreign policy, and specifically about Europe.
This is a more difficult and more urgent task than anything he has so far
undertaken. The commentators applauded Mr Blair's promise to reform the
Labour constitution and the Clause 4 commitment to nationalisation. But his
challenge to the left is not really a heroic effort of new thinking:
everybody has long known that Clause 4 is just an inert shibboleth inherited
from the distant past. This was really just a piece of political theatre:
easy to understand, vibrant with symbolism, but devoid of operational
significance.
Europe is a different matter. This is not an ancient tabernacle of old
bones, but a colossal new problem that looms ahead; and the choices that
will have to be made risk splitting the country from stem to stern. But the
dividing line will not be between Labour and Tory; there is a fault line
which may split both parties, and indeed the whole country.
Until now, the dominant characteristic of the British debate about Europe
has been a pretence that the issue can be fudged. At the fringes there is a
small minority of uncompromising federalists; and opposing them is a larger
minority of visceral anti-Europeans. But the middle ground is occupied by a
vast flock of ostriches; they vaguely assume that the UK ought in some
lukewarm sense stay 'in Europe', but they hope against hope that all
rigorous decisions can be avoided.
'Ostrichism' has two consequences. Neither of the main parties of government
has so far been able to set out a coherent European strategy. As a result,
both of them are liable to be jerked about by the atavism of the
anti-Europeans.
This situation is deplorable, because it means that Britain does not really
count in the grand debate on Europe's future. How could it, when the
government is vaguely but incoherently anti-European, and the opposition has
yet to get to grips with the question?
It is true that Mr Blair's tone on Europe is more positive than John
Major's. But he still sounds like a man who is hedging his bets.
In his fullest policy statement on Europe, Mr Blair said that the UK needs a
'development in Europe of the ways in which we co-operate on foreign and
security policy'; and this in turn will 'involve an assessment of our
attitude to eastern Europe'. As for the programme for economic and monetary
union and a single currency, Mr Blair has said the UK should keep an open
mind. These pronouncements are not a bright beacon for the confused of
middle England.
Some people may think there is no rush. Labour's new leader still has time
in hand to work out a thorough European policy, they believe. The moment of
truth will not come until the Inter-Governmental Conference which is
supposed to revise the Maastricht treaty, and it does not meet until 1996.
Such a 'no hurry' attitude is based on a double fallacy, however. It is true
that the IGC does not formally convene until 1996. But the outcome of the
conference will to a significant degree be decided beforehand, in the
preparatory debates over the agenda; and those debates are already under
way, with the Germans (and the French) setting the pace as usual.
In fact, it is the Germans who are out in front, with at least two coherent
blueprints for a radical shift towards a more integrated Europe in 1996:
first with the report of the European structural commission financed by the
Bertelsmann foundation, published in June and soon to appear in English; and
more recently with the paper from the governing Christian Democrat (CDU)
party.
The most fundamental question is, what is the purpose of the conference? Is
it just a routine 5,000km tune-up of the Maastricht treaty in the light of
experience? Or should it be, as the Germans obviously believe, a
far-reaching rethink and revision of the European Union, its policies and
its institutions? This fundamental choice, between a big conference and a
little conference, will largely determine the agenda of 1996; and it will
gradually emerge, as a result of the debates starting now.
The second fallacy in the 'no rush' approach, is that it takes no account of
democracy. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty was a nightmare, mainly
because governments treated voters and parliaments as an after-thought. They
cannot afford to repeat the experience; and governments which want a big IGC
in 1996 will also want to make sure that public opinion is kept in touch
with the arguments and the issues well in advance. 'We want to avoid the
main mistake of Maastricht,' says Werner Weidenfeld, editor of the
Bertelsmann report, 'the almost complete absence of a public debate.'
The British may imagine they can have the kind of conference they want, and
prepare accordingly. Obviously Mr Major would prefer a little conference,
because he is hostile to the quasi-federalist notions of the Germans. The
danger is that the British may rely on foot-dragging, in the hope that they
can avoid or prevent a big conference, until it is too late to prepare the
voters for a different scenario. For it is probable that the UK shall face a
big conference anyway, partly because a majority of member states will want
it, but mainly because the European Union cannot be enlarged to the east
without it.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Threat to tear apart big beast: NTT of Japan will resist
plans to break it up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the part-privatised Japanese
telecommunications operator and the world's most valuable company, is
preparing to fight off the third attempt in 10 years to break it up.
Today, UK investors will be invited to buy shares in the company -
capitalised at Y13,603bn (Pounds 85bn) - when it makes its debut on the
London Stock Exchange. Last month, NTT was listed in New York.
Mr Masashi Kojima, NTT's tough-talking president, hopes that success in
attracting foreign investors will help fend off a break-up of the company by
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications when its status comes up for
review next spring, five years after the last such exercise.
The company wants to boost its poor international image and raise the
proportion of shares in foreign hands above 1.5 per cent, a fraction of the
average for leading listed Japanese companies.
At issue is how fast Japan will modernise its backward telecommunications
industry, and provide companies and private subscribers with the advanced
communications they need in the next decade.
The ministry wants to divide the group into a long-distance unit and one or
several local monopolies to increase competition and improve efficiency. The
model is AT&amp;T in the US, which was split in 1984 into several companies that
have become fiercely competitive in the home market and abroad.
NTT's detractors say that the arguments for break-up look stronger today
than in 1985, when the ministry first launched a campaign to dismember the
group in the run-up to partial privatisation. Japanese telecommunications
lag 10 years behind the US in the scope of services, according to Jardine
Fleming Securities.
Japan is, for example, well behind the US in installing digital technology
in local networks, where NTT has a monopoly. Prices on long-distance calls
have fallen less fast than in the US - despite competition from five private
operators. The proportion of mobile phone users, where NTT has a 60 per cent
share of the domestic market, is among the lowest in the developed world.
Only recently has it been possible to buy a mobile phone - they had to be
rented until last April.
While there is competition on trunk calls, the company's competitors allege
that it has charged them unfairly high rates for connecting long-distance
calls through its own local networks. And they claim that profits from the
local monopoly subsidise operations in the long-distance market.
Mr Kojima denies that NTT is overcharging long-distance competitors, and
points out that prices have fallen by an average of 12 per cent a year. The
access charges paid by long-distance operators for using the local network
are in line with those in the UK and US, he says.
However, the competitors also allege that NTT uses its monopoly over the
local network to get access to crucial business information and to delay or
even thwart new services. Separating NTT's long-distance from its local
business would weaken its monopoly power and force it to set lower access
rates, they argue.
NTT's case for staying together is not helped by its poor financial
performance. Profits have fallen for the past four years. Today's share
price of Y872,000 is well below the Y1.197m at which the first tranche of
the company's shares was floated in 1986.
Even at this level, the shares stand at almost 184 times this year's
prospective earnings, a price/earnings ratio that is unlikely to be
attractive to non-Japanese investors.
Over the next few months, Mr Kojima will try to persuade the ministry
mandarins that NTT has been reborn under his guidance. The company has cut
labour costs and focused on fast-growing services, such as recently
deregulated mobile phones. 'We used to be like an elephant. Now we are a
lean, strong tiger,' he says.
Securities analysts now predict a gentle profits revival next year and a
strong recovery in 1996. However, the outlook for a longer-term profits
recovery depends partly on persuading the ministry to agree a rise in local
call rates on top of a rise in line-hire charges, likely to take effect
early next year. NTT has lost money on this part of its business for 15 of
the 17 years since the cost of a local call was frozen by the ministry at
Y10 for three minutes - one of Japan's rare bargains.
The company has asked for an 18 per cent increase in local call charges next
year or in 1996. Mr Kojima is confident that the ministry will concede a
rise, perhaps slightly below this level.
The company's other main defence against dismemberment rests on the growing
complexity of the tasks required of a national operator. Mr Kojima says 'the
situation has changed dramatically' since the last time a break-up was aired
in 1990.
NTT's telephone services face growing competition from private mobile
operators, at a time when the arrival of multimedia will push up research
costs. With US regional telephone companies pursuing integration in response
to these pressures, it would be eccentric for NTT to follow the opposite
tack and split up, says Mr Kojima. Only a single group can invest the
Y45,000bn needed to catch up with the US and give Japan a full multimedia
network, offering services such as video on demand, home shopping and
banking.
In fending off NTT's detractors, Mr Kojima has lost the support of important
allies, including customers, who have become more aware of the benefits
greater competition has brought in other countries.
The Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, has also embraced
deregulation in its eagerness to drive down business costs at a time when
the strength of the yen is damaging Japanese competitiveness. NTT's position
as Japan's largest buyer by far of electrical equipment, with an annual
budget of Y1,900bn, used to assure it of business support, but the Keidanren
is now said to support an NTT break-up.
The trade unions, another old NTT ally, may be rethinking their loyalty.
They helped block two previous break-up attempts, in defence of Japan's
largest private sector employer and the system of lifetime employment NTT
represented. That loyalty has been weakened by the company's decision last
year to cut 10,000 jobs, 13 per cent of the workforce, as part of an attack
on NTT's uncompetitive labour costs.
One important ally remains reluctant to split NTT: the finance ministry,
which wants to sell part of its 65.6 per cent holding of the company's
shares. A plan to reduce its stake to 50 per cent in 1991 had to be delayed
because of the poor performance of the shares. The ministry, which is more
influential politically than its telecommunications colleagues, believes
keeping the company intact will maximise the price on share sales.
Whatever the outcome of the battle over the future of NTT, foreign investors
are unlikely to be affected, say securities analysts. If the company were
broken up into several local operators, a package of the new companies'
shares would probably perform just the same as NTT over the years, says Mr
Barry Dargan of SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank handling the listing.
Mr Kojima hopes that more foreign interest in NTT might help change
telecommunications ministry mandarins' uncharitable view. 'Not even the
ministry can ignore public opinion,' he says.
But Japan's new drive for deregulation means he faces a tough fight to
justify NTT's existence in its present shape. It is evidence, for those who
doubt Japan's new enthusiasm for deregulation, that even the biggest
corporate beasts are being challenged.

Sir, According to Joe Rogaly, 'today's Conservative ministry has trapped
itself on the shores of free-market minimalism' ('Echoes of Tory voices',
October 7). Rogaly seems to have forgotten that nearly half the British
economy - more than 44 per cent - is in the public sector. What would it be
like under a Labour ministry, full of politicians who were actually keen on
spending other people's money?

FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Misguided protectionism in defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HENDERSON and Mr DAVID SAWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your feature on the forthcoming order for military helicopters from the
British government ('Helicopter makers in a spin', October 6) shows that
protectionism lives on in British defence procurement, despite the ample
evidence of its harmful and even disastrous effects on costs and performance
in the past.
The instruction to bidders that as much of the work as possible should be
placed in the UK is misguided on two grounds: that it involves protection,
and that it does so in an inefficient and ill-considered way.
As to the first and fundamental point, there is no valid reason to grant a
subsidy to British rather than overseas elements of system costs. Each
bidder could in any case be expected to place as much work in Britain as was
consistent with minimising these costs. To require a higher British content
would increase the prospective costs, and would mean an inefficient use of
British resources.
In the competitive market that the government claims to believe in, and
which it has been fostering in some areas, resources will move where their
output is worth most. If resources can be used in a helicopter programme
only because a subsidy is paid, they can be expected to produce less than
they could in other uses.
The apparent willingness to pay a subsidy in this case may be accounted for
by (1) the still-prevalent belief that products identified as 'high-tech'
have some semi-mystical value of their own, over and above what people are
willing to pay for them, and/or (2) a tacit assumption that the resources in
question would otherwise be unemployed. But the first argument is mistaken,
and the second highly improbable for the skilled resources involved. If
there is a problem of labour mobility, it is better dealt with by general
measures than by ad hoc subsidies. Why should helicopter production be
treated differently from coal mining?
The requirement to place as much of the work as possible in the UK is a
recipe for needless inefficiency unless the relative costs of different
mixes, British and foreign, are clearly brought out. It is important that in
each case the bidders should have to specify which mix would minimise costs,
and what increases in costs would be caused by different ways of increasing
the British contribution.
Finally we hope that Bernard Gray is mistaken in supposing that it is
unlikely that orders could be placed for both the Lockheed C130J and the
Apache helicopter system, because buying both would be one American purchase
too many for the Ministry of Defence. If the present government allowed such
nationalistic sentiments to determine its decisions on defence procurement,
whatever the evidence on costs and performance, it would show that it is as
willing as its predecessors to waste taxpayers' money. It would also give
the nation defences which are weaker than they need or ought to be.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Home delivery is answer to stores'
green damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R E CRUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, is trying to get supermarkets
to agree on recycling; at the same time there is concern about the miles
travelled by the produce they sell ('Industry may be forced to fund
recycling of packaging', October 10).
What about the miles travelled by their customers and the social and
environmental damage that causes? My local supermarket, just off the city
centre, only welcomes cars, to the considerable detriment of the nearby
residential areas. There is no direct access for public transport, and the
only pedestrian access is directly across a busy dual carriageway.
Absolutely classic bad planning.
Mr Gummer should do some more head-bashing and make supermarkets take action
to reduce customer use of cars. To do this, they could be required to
provide a delivery service. That would at least provide some inducement for
people to leave their cars at home and reduce environmental damage, as well
as offering help for the elderly and disabled.
Of course, if we were really modern the delivery service would, on a
restricted basis, extend to telephone and computer contacts as well as
personal rambles around the stores.
The central thing is that there is an ever-increasing need for government to
grapple with the environmental ill-effects of supermarkets and force them to
accept some responsibility for the damage they cause. A delivery service
would be a good start.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Abuse of dominance is why fine was
upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E S SINGLETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The European Commission's record Ecu75m fine against Tetra Pak has been
upheld (World Trade News: 'Tetra Pak loses appeal against fine', October 7).
Your report states that Tetra Pak was regarded by the Commission as 'too
dominant'. In fact, article 86 of the Treaty of Rome does not outlaw
dominance. Market dominance often occurs because a company produces products
consumers want. It is the abuse of that dominant position which can result
in fines of up to 10 per cent of worldwide annual group turnover under the
EU competition rules.
Tetra Pak was found to have engaged in a range of practices such as
discriminatory and predatory pricing, requiring purchasers of the company's
machines to use only Tetra Pak manufactured cartons on the machines,
excessively long leasing contracts and restrictions on re-sale of machines.
As reported, the appeal centred on the definition of the relevant market,
often the hardest issue in EU competition cases. It is unfortunate that the
Commission is now considering, in a new technology transfer regulation,
outlawing common provisions found in patent and know-how licences for
companies with larger market shares; this will increase legal costs and add
uncertainty to many licensing arrangements.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Arts: Doctor Knock - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme photographs of Sam Walters' 1979 production of Doctor Knock
are almost indistinguishable from his 1994 version, yet the world has
changed in 15 years. The temptation is to interpret this revival as being
intended to make a comment upon the currently hot issue of public health
care.
Such connections are at best specious. Jules Romains' 1923 comedy (presented
here in Harley Granville Barker's pithy translation) deals with an ambitious
doctor who sets out to make a success of a small-town practice and ends up
effectively creating a cult of hypochondria in order to maximise his own
takings. Hardly a relevant comparison, either, to private health insurance
schemes (which would seemingly rather do without the patient altogether).
Nor does Walters' direction succumb to the lure of social punditry. He is
concerned wholly with a finely told, amusing yarn, which for the most part
he serves diligently.
The cards are stacked against the sleepy burghers of St Maurice from the
start; the villagers are little more than a collection of stereotypes
(grinning bumpkins, effete schoolmaster, snobbish grande dame etc) ripe for
exploitation by Doctor Knock. Geoffrey Beevers' Knock is a masterly
creation: flattering his clients, gulling them into feeling non-existent
illnesses and subtly interrogating them as to how much they can pay for
treatment, all in an easy flow of urbane imperturbability.
Knock's confidence in his own aptitude is unshakeable: to his near-equals
(of course, he can admit to having no true peer) he shows a brisk candour
regarding his enterprise while just as craftily enlisting their complicity.
Within three months Knock turns his brand of medicine into a religion of
fanatical daily observance throughout his little realm, rhapsodising about
lamps burning into the night at patients' bedsides and envisioning '250
rectal thermometers lifted in unison and firmly inserted' as a perverse mass
salute. At this point Walters and Beevers over-egg the pudding by imbuing
Knock with moments of barking megalomania culminating in a final
rubber-gloved Nuremburg tableau. It is apparent enough that the man's steely
determination has both trapped and unhinged him without resorting to such
coarse touches.
Doctor Knock sits comfortably within the Orange Tree's prime constituency: a
craftsmanlike production of a neglected work, chosen for entertainment
rather than argument. It may not be easy to fathom why Walters is so
repeatedly drawn to the play (he first staged it in 1967; Beevers has played
the eponymous role in all three productions), but each new audience will no
doubt find it agreeable enough.
At the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, until November 26 (081 940 3633).

FT  12 OCT 94 / Arts: The orchestra reinvented - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC Symphony calls its current Berlioz celebration on the South Bank,
'Reinventing the Orchestra'. On Monday, again with Andrew Davis conducting,
we had two striking examples of that: one by Berlioz himself, the early
overture Les Francs-juges, and Kaija Saariaho's 1990 Du Cristal. The climax
of the concert, however, was Berlioz's great Te Deum, for large orchestra,
organ and triple chorus, which is not so much 'reinvention' as magisterial
consolidation.
Les Francs-juges went with brilliant sonorities and clatter, obviously
inspired by Weber (think of the Freischutz overture) but no less obviously
French and confidently original. Berlioz composed the first version at 23;
David Cairns' excellent programme-notes speculated that in later drafts -
the original is lost - it acquired authority as well as a lot more
instruments.
Now, however, we know the even earlier Messe solenelle, 'lost' but recently
rediscovered, from which much music was to be recycled in his mature scores.
And though it acquired refinements in its various new dresses, the pristine
inventions of the original were astounding from the start: no wonder that
Berlioz used to be unjustly reputed as an extraordinary orchestrator but an
amateurish composer. It takes time to realise that the music and the
'effects' are indissoluble.
There is no mistaking that in the Te Deum, where the grandeur of the 'Tibi
omnes' and above all the 'Judex crederis' - in Cairns's memorable phrase,
'swaying between terror and splendour like the swing of an enormous bell' -
are wholly musical. The Davis performance was splendid, with the
Philharmonia Chorus vying with the orchestra in weight and depth, and John
Aler a moving tenor soloist. The New London Children's Choir was well up to
standard too.
One regretted just a little the dryness of the Royal Festival Hall acoustic.
The solemn opening chords, for example, alternating between orchestra and
organ, were designed for the reverberant church of St. Eustache; here there
was only dead air between them. The grand organ part was well played by
Malcolm Hicks, but much subdued by the closed upper doors before the
organ-pipes. Surely a mistake? - even if the requirements of the live
broadcast made it seem prudent. The Festival Hall organ cannot be at the
opposite end from the orchestra, as Berlioz intended, but it can roar, and
it didn't.
Miss Saariaho's Du Cristal is a study in soft, infinitely refined orchestral
densities. It fields a synthesiser and any amount of percussion. Little by
little, one perceives slow harmonic breakdown and change as if through deep
water - or behind crystal, as her title suggests, or even ice (she is
Finnish, and the score has a distinct Nordic atmosphere). On the surface
tiny tunelets float and bob; just occasionally, the variously deployed
orchestral sections come together in hammered ostinati.
It holds and tantalises the ear, to mysterious expressive effect. When we
can hear it together with its companion-piece, a 'capricious' double
concerto called . . . a la fumee, more may be revealed. One cannot but be
intrigued by learning that the solo cello-trill that ends Du Cristal so
delicately is also the first sound in . . . a la fumee.

Vincent Hanna is one of the best informed, most relaxed, and (crucially
important) funny political journalists on television. The only trouble is
that he tends to recognise this better than anyone. Still, A Week In
Politics is just about the best political programme we have, and A Year In
Politics, the title chosen for the annual party conference programmes, is
particularly good. Hanna has considerable success in convincing his guests
that it is so late at night on a minority channel (12.10 C4) that nobody
will be watching and they can therefore let their hair down and say anything
they like. He, and consequently his viewers, had a wonderful time at
Blackpool last week: will the Tories also do us proud in Bournemouth?
Earlier, BBC1 screens the last episode in the first series of Common As
Muck, William Ivory's drama about dustmen. He has managed to plait the theme
of impending privatisation quite successfully with the other strands of the
men's lives (9.30). Another council employee, rat-catcher Paul Taylor, holds
the camera for Video Diaries, telling us of his anti-Nazi activities (9.30
BBC2).

FT  12 OCT 94 / Arts: Driven out of the intellect business - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So this is the fabled autumn season, is it? The one which is supposed to
redeem the reputations of the broadcasters after a summer full of repeats
and cheap imports? Yet many viewers seem unimpressed. Their feelings are
summed up by the novelist Jill Paton Walsh, featured in the regular Guardian
item 'My Media' on Monday. Of television she said: 'We watch it less and
less. We're not even going to have a TV set in our second home in Cornwall -
John said it wasn't worth having one just to watch elephants at water holes.
We see Newsnight and The Late Show, and nature programmes and good drama.
But we increasingly feel TV is no longer directed at people like us:
middlebrow, moderately intellectual'.
'No longer directed at people like us . . .' Of course the new season has
brought new series, though as usual some called 'new' are geriatrically old.
University Challenge, for instance, first appeared in 1962. Switching it
from ITV to BBC2 and sticking Jeremy Paxman in Bamber Gascoigne's chair does
not make it new. Actually it makes it rather inferior because with Gascoigne
you always felt that he knew the answers without being told, whereas Paxman
gives the impression that he would like you to think he knew but has sneaked
a look at the card.
In the case of The Moral Maze the programme is genuinely new to this medium
(BBC2 again) but is another example of television's increasingly frequent
piracy on the radio seas. Of course the brains trust pre-dates all forms of
broadcasting, but this particular team has been hijacked whole from Radio 4.
As so often with talk shows, the formula works better on radio where you do
not have to look at Janet Daley's hairdo, or wonder why David Starkey seems
different from his last appearance (he has shaved off his moustache).
Most heavily hyped of all the borrowings from radio is Knowing Me, Knowing
You in which Steve Coogan in his Alan Partridge persona plays a chat show
host of such embarrassing crassness that I find it hard to watch. This is
another instance - Nigel Planer's spoof master class in acting was a
previous notable example - where material sufficient for a brilliant
10-minute sketch has been pulled out like chewing gum to stretch across not
just a whole programme but an entire series. The fifth time you hear
'Knowing me, Alan Partridge, knowing you Charlie Farnsbarns. Aha' you
fidget. The tenth time you grind your teeth. The 15th time you change
channels.
The complaint is not that the material on British television this autumn is
unprofessional. All four of the terrestrial channels, which still account
for more than 93 per cent of viewing, can point to new series that have been
superbly well made, for instance the 'family at war' serial Seaforth on
BBC1, the documentary series Reputations on BBC2, the series about a police
psychologist, Cracker, on ITV, and the topical light entertainment series
Rory Bremner, Who Else? on Channel 4. The complaint is twofold: that so many
programmes now aim chiefly at maximising ratings, and that, however good,
they all represent types of programming that are well tried and tested.
Where is the fizz, the buzz, the dangerous novelty?
Most of all, where is the programme that makes you want to switch on because
it feels as though it really is in touch with what is happening in the world
today, in a 'moderately intellectual' way? Watching Labour Party Live on
BBC1 and BBC2 last week you began to wonder whether we might have reached a
historic watershed with the Blair faction in the Labour Party finally
leaving 1945 and Beveridge behind and looking out across new territory.
Perhaps 'communitarianism' is what it is all about and politics will
henceforth focus on smaller units. Perhaps, conversely, politics is becoming
irresistibly international. Peter Jay's engrossing report on Panorama this
week suggested that the old restraints of national boundaries are being
removed from the world of employment (or unemployment) and wages.
The conference coverage and the Panorama report were, of course, as topical
as you could ask. Furthermore there have been programmes in the recent past
which have capitalised (ho ho) on the collapse of communism in eastern
Europe; the final programme in BBC2's Reputations series, for example,
provided a portrait of Beria which could not have been made before the
Soviet archives were opened up. So, as we might expect, it is not a question
of broadcasters being blind to what is going on around them. However, such
programmes are relatively rare; far, far more time is occupied by programmes
such as Seaforth, yet another authentically filmed yarn beginning in the
second world war, or The Danny Baker Show, a chat show which has already
been reduced to the desperate old ploy of featuring another chat show host
(Jonathan Ross) as guest.
It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that television has been virtually
driven out of the intellect business and into the market place. Those mainly
to blame are the politicians whose tunnel vision, fear, and spite were
largely responsible for the last lot of broadcasting legislation, though
they were helped by top broadcasting executives who much too readily
accepted the 'nothing wrong with ratings' philosophy. It is not professional
skills that are being lost; technically speaking our programme makers get
better and better. What is disappearing is the work which used to make
British television a truly significant element within our society.
The change is strikingly exemplified by the Channel 4 series Alan Bleasdale
Presents which uses as a come-on the name of a man known for his
outspokenness and for an idiosyncratic sort of drama which provided the
nation with the phrase 'Gissa job'. Last night's offering was a glossy TV
movie called 'Requiem Apache' which offered yet another variation on the
familiar old theme of the retired slick operator (spy, safe-breaker,
whatever - in this case a getaway driver) who is wanted by his former
colleagues to do another job.
It was slickly made and impressively cast, albeit somewhat thin in plotting
for its 90 minutes, yet often funny. All the dramas in this series come from
new writers and this, from actor Raymond Murtagh, was certainly full of
promise. But apart from the professionalism there was nothing in it which
you would associate with the sort of work that Alan Bleasdale stands for.
The car chase was good, the use of music - for once - excellent, the
photography lovely, and the ratings may well prove impressive. But I doubt
whether Jill Paton Walsh will see it as a reason for having a television in
that second home in Cornwall.

FT  12 OCT 94 / People: Cuoni quits Coutts Zurich
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank is likely to increase its management grip on
Coutts, the frock-coated bankers to Britain's royal family, following the
resignation of Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts International
Private Banking in Zurich.
Cuoni, 57, was appointed chairman of the executive committee of Coutts AG in
Zurich in 1988 after 28 years with Citibank. David Went, who took over as
chief executive of the Coutts Group in June, says Cuoni has done a
'fantastic job' in bringing together a group of very disparate businesses.
However, Cuoni felt that the time had come for someone else to take Coutts'
International business forward.
Coutts has offices in 14 countries and Went is keen to expand the
international side of its business. The group opens its Hong Kong office
this week and is expected to open three offices in California over the next
few months.
Although Cuoni was never a member of one of the families which ran Coutts
for many years, he was a member of a senior management team which has been
gradually replaced as NatWest has taken a firmer hold on a part of its
business which has never really fulfilled its potential. Ian Farnsworth, a
NatWest general manager, took over from Julian Robarts as managing director
of Coutts &amp; Co in early 1992 and just over a year ago, Sir David
Money-Coutts stepped down as chairman of the group.
Went denied yesterday that Cuoni's departure had anything to do with
NatWest's increasing involvement with one of the world's great banking brand
names. He said it was unlikely that Cuoni's successor would come from
NatWest and that he was looking for an international banker of 'some
stature'.

FT  12 OCT 94 / People: Leven on the rise at Holiday Inn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, has appointed Michael Leven
president and chief operating officer of its Holiday Inn subsidiary.
The appointment to this newly-created position led to speculation by leisure
analysts yesterday that Leven was being groomed to take over from Bryan
Langton, Holiday Inn's chairman and chief executive. The only flaw in this
view is that the two men are too close in age. Langton is 57, with three
years to go until retirement. Leven is only a year younger.
Bass said yesterday that no conclusions should be drawn from the appointment
except that Holiday Inn believed Leven had a job to do.
The chain recently announced a rebranding of its most expensive hotels, the
Crowne Plaza properties, which will no longer carry the Holiday Inn name.
The company has also embarked on an aggressive expansion campaign. Over the
past two years it has, on average, opened a new hotel every second day. It
now operates or franchises over 1,900 hotels in 60 countries.
Ian Prosser, Bass chairman, says Leven will be responsible for Holiday Inn's
worldwide hotel operations and sales; Langton would focus more closely on
strategic issues.
Leven joined Holiday Inn in 1990 as head of franchising in the Americas,
after serving as a senior executive with several US hotel companies. He
became president of Holiday Inn's Americas division last year.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: Business schools set out their stall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business schools in Europe have been making cautiously optimistic noises
about a revival of interest in the MBA. A reception in London next Monday
evening organised by the UK-based Association of MBAs will put their
confidence to the test.
Altogether, 41 schools from the UK, continental Europe and the US will be
available to answer questions from prospective students. Those who attend
will be able to find out about the availability and suitability of courses
and about various methods of financing their studies. All modes of MBA
'delivery' - full-time, part-time and 'distance learning'  - will be
represented.
According to Roger McCormick, director general of AMBA, would-be students
'will be able to speak directly not only to admissions directors and
business school faculty, but also to graduates about what it was really
like'.
The participating schools include 23 from the UK (including London,
Ashridge, Cranfield, Manchester and Henley), 10 from continental Europe (eg,
IESE of Barcelona, Insead in France and Rotterdam of the Netherlands) and
top US institutions such as Harvard, Wharton, Stanford and MIT.
The reception will be held at the Institute of Directors, 116 Pall Mall,
London W1. Details from AMBA on 071-837 3375.
                       *       *       *
The European Foundation for Management Development in Brussels has announced
that this year's European Case Writing competition winner is Dr Morgan Gould
from IMD in Switzerland. The prize - intended to improve and expand the
availability of European-based teaching and training materials - was awarded
for the case Revolution at Oticon. Robert Brown of Cranfield University was
winner of the entrepreneurship category for his case Dockspeed.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: High cost of feeling down / A look at depression
in the office and how to spot it - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Depression can strike anyone, from office cleaner to chief executive. In
various degrees, it affects up to 60 per cent of adults at some time in
their lives, and at least 50 per cent of these will suffer serious
depressive illness.
In the UK, the cost to industry of depression - let alone other mental
illness - is estimated to be more than Pounds 3bn a year.
Most of us know roughly what is meant by depression, but recognising it in
others is more difficult. Symptoms of depression can be surprisingly
physical, with complaints of headache, aches and pains, lack of energy,
insomnia or early-morning wakening, changes in appetite, weight loss (or
sometimes gain), constipation, dizziness and loss of libido.
All these can be caused by physical illness, and a recent study shows that
GPs miss the diagnosis in about 50 per cent of depressed patients at the
first consultation.
There can, however, be important clues to depression in attitude or mood in
the workplace. Depressed colleagues may show less interest in work, have
difficulty coping with their usual workload, or become more irritable with
others. They may have trouble making decisions, or blame themselves
unnecessarily when things go wrong.
Depression can be disabling socially too, and anhedonia - inability to
experience pleasure - is significant. Perhaps someone in your department has
not laughed for a long time or seems unable to relax.
There is evidence that depression is partly a biochemical accident. But we
are still far from regarding mental illness in the same light as we do
diabetes.
A MORI survey commissioned last year by the Defeat Depression Campaign
suggested that half the population believe depression is not the sort of
thing to see the GP about. And many depressed people, including doctors,
fear the effect the diagnosis could have on their career. Treatment,
however, is what they need. With a few exceptions, depression does not get
better on its own or with exhortations to pull oneself together.
Treatment falls into two main categories: drug therapy and non-drug therapy.
Many favour the former, but there is a drop-out rate of about 30 per cent,
which reflects the incidence of side-effects such as dry mouth (newer drugs
tend to have fewer), as well as public misconception that antidepressants
are addictive.
Non-drug treatments are becoming more popular, incuding counselling and
cognitive therapy, which is psychological treatment aimed at altering
negative patterns of thought leading to depression.
Psychological techniques are time-consuming, at least to begin with, and may
demand regular time off work. Their exact place in the treatment of
depression is uncertain, but they often work best in conjunction with drugs.
Untreated, depression can be fatal. In the UK, 5,000 people die through
suicide every year. Of these deaths, most are associated with depression,
and the toll seems to be rising among men aged between 16 and 30.
The government has a target of reducing the overall suicide rate by at least
15 per cent by the year 2000. But the extent to which treatment for
depression can influence the suicide rate is uncertain. Some authorities
believe treatment is itself a risk factor, particularly with the older types
of antidepressants.
It is commonly agreed, however, that better diagnosis and management of
depression would be an appropriate and cost-effective aim.
A leaflet, Depression in the Workplace, is available for 40p from the Defeat
Depression Campaign, Royal College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square,
London SW1X 8PG (tel 071 235 2351).
* Dr Cooper is a practising GP.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: Career moves in Tokyo - Mitsubishi has
recognised that its managers do not have to be Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most innovative Japanese multinationals lag well behind their
western competitors in inviting foreign executives to compete for top jobs.
As a consequence, Japanese companies risk failing to make full use of
foreign talent, at a time when their need for outside management - Asian as
well as western - is growing faster than ever before.
Trendsetters such as Sony, the entrepreneurial electronics group, have long
ago taken this message to heart. But Sony is a special case. The use of
senior foreign management is still rare among more traditional players in
Japanese business.
One of them, Mitsubishi Corporation, the sprawling international empire
which is Japan's largest general trading company, has just seen the light
and is taking steps to create a merit-based career path for foreign managers
in a traditional Japanese seniority-based hierarchy.
Its experience in this regard is at an early stage, but already instructive.
Early this year, Mitsubishi inaugurated an international human resources
development unit in its Tokyo head office. Its manager is Mohan Patel, an
intelligent, gently-spoken Canadian of mixed Indian and Japanese extraction,
who has spent 14 years as a trader in the machinery division.
Patel, 44, is himself an example of the kind of manager he is trying to
foster. Younger than Japanese colleagues at the same level, he is the only
foreign manager among nearly 10,000 head office staff.
His five-person unit has been fully operational for four months, long enough
for Patel to identify the main tasks needed to make more efficient use of
Mitsubishi's 4,000 non-Japanese employees worldwide and the 20 staff from
overseas subsidiaries who have moved to head office in the past five years.
Mitsubishi has a long history of hiring foreigners in the 600 overseas joint
ventures in which it has equity stakes across the world, ranging from
printed circuit board manufacturing to pharmaceuticals.
Until a few years ago, however, nearly all of them were support staff,
working under Japanese managers. That has started to change, slowly, so the
group now has six foreign directors of its overseas joint ventures. 'We need
to delegate increasing responsibility to local staff, so our requirements
have started to rise,' says Patel.
Mitsubishi realises that joint venture managers do not necessarily have to
be Japanese, if only because it is hard for such a large hierarchical
organisation to train 'true managers' to take charge of far-flung
subsidiaries, says Patel. The supply of Japanese managers is also starting
to fall in line with the country's ageing population, a trend that is easy
to spot early in a seniority-based hierarchy such as Mitsubishi's.
To retain and make efficient use of foreign executives, 'we have to consider
how to train these individuals and provide them with more opportunities
within the group', says Patel.
The main problem, he says, is that Mitsubishi lacks a system for rotating
foreign managers through the group, from one foreign unit to another or even
through Tokyo. Denied a clear career path, a growing number of foreign staff
were leaving for other companies after completing a single posting.
The solution is essentially technical, he believes. Traditionally, staff are
promoted only within their own division or within their foreign joint
venture, where the opportunities are naturally limited.
A handful of exceptions have been made for foreigners, who did not easily
fit into the Japanese hierarchy because they tended to enter the group via a
joint venture or subsidiary, often in mid-career. They include the transfer
of a Bostonian via Tokyo to Singapore, then to France, where he has for the
past two years been managing director of a circuit board factory. Another US
executive moved from New York to be number two at a chemicals plant in the
Netherlands. 'In the past, there was an independent discussion each time we
made an appointment like this,' says Patel.
His first task, therefore, will be to set up a clearly understood system for
transferring foreign executives between divisions. To assist this process,
Patel's unit has been given responsibilities across Mitsubishi's seven
divisions, along with the elite planning committees that sit just beneath
the board.
Another task identified is to set up a regular system for giving foreign
executives exposure to head office, for short postings of up to two years.
Authority at Mitsubishi is centralised, so managers who know the ropes at
head office have a clear advantage. 'Our overseas staff have very loose job
descriptions because our activities are so diverse, from trading to finance
and manufacturing. So it boils down to creativity . . . but you can't
function in that environment unless you know what it takes to convince your
bosses in Tokyo,' says Patel.
Until now, foreign managers had to wait for an invitation from a talent
spotter in Tokyo to achieve that kind of exposure. That was, in fact, what
happened to Patel, who spent nine years selling machinery in Canada before
his divisional boss asked him to move to Japan in 1989, to take up another
trading job.
As in most Japanese companies, there remains a limit to foreign executives'
promotion prospects. There are none, for example, on Mitsubishi's board of
directors.
That will change 'in the not too distant future', Patel predicts. But the
first foreigner to sit on Mitsubishi's board may well be Chinese, to make a
contribution to developing one of its fastest growing markets, rather than
European or American.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Camera friendly / A look at
Japan's attempts to clean up the disposal of used photo development solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese photo film industry is facing up to international pressure for
a more environment friendly way to dispose of used photo development
solution.
The country's photo film industry generates around 140,000 tonnes of used
photo development solution a year, some 20 per cent of the world's output.
The used solution is being placed in containers and then dumped into the
sea.
However, dumping of industrial waste is to be banned at the end of next year
under the London Convention, a worldwide treaty on sea pollution.
The Japanese environment agency is to put together its own legislation,
which will be put into effect at the beginning of 1996.
Companies are now searching for alternatives to dumping, ahead of the London
Convention. One option is to decompose the solution.
Attempts to do this have until recently been unsuccessful, as once the
chemicals for development are combined into a solution, that solution
becomes highly stable and difficult to decompose. However, Fuji Photo Film,
the country's leading photo film manufacturer, earlier this month announced
the first technology to purify used photo development solution.
Toxic elements, including ammonia and nitrogenous compounds, are eliminated
from the waste solution by microbial decomposition and oxidation using a
metal catalyst, leaving only water and salts. The company has installed a
Y300m (Pounds 1.9m) demonstration system in eastern Japan, and officials say
since incineration is not involved, nitrogen oxides and other gases are not
emitted. However, the prototype system for commercial use is expected to
take more than two years to develop.
Konica has already partially solved the solution waste problem with its
waste water recycling machine, developed with Tokyo Electric Power, the
electric utility concern.
The machine, sold commercially since the beginning of last year, allows
retail photo development laboratories to condense the used development
solution to less than a tenth of the original amount.
The machine is integrated into the company's 'mini-lab' photo operation, a
computer-controlled development system which costs Y5.6m for one version and
Y7m for a higher capacity machine. Using heat and pressure, the solution is
divided into water and sludge. The water can be reused in the photo labs for
photo development, while the sludge is collected by a subsidiary of Konica
for incineration.
An average lab which produces 20 plastic tanks containing 20 litres of the
solution in each, will only have to deal with seven 5-litre bags of sludge
when using the machine. Lab owners can also save on storage space and do not
have to transport heavy tanks of waste.
Moreover, Konica says the machine is cost-effective as well as
environment-friendly. By using the recycled water and cutting down on waste
collection fees, the company believes that users who develop 50 rolls of
film daily can save up to Y20,000 a month.
So far, the company has sold around 600 units and last month started full
production of the 'mini-lab', manufacturing 1,500 units a year.
Meanwhile, Konica announced last month that it expected the introduction of
chemical tablets - to replace the traditional chemical solutions - to
increase sales. The tablets are dissolved in water and come in plastic
cartridges which are collected and reused.
Konica says that because the tablets are not messy, are easy to carry around
and eliminate errors when mixing several chemicals together they are
extremely user friendly.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Recyclable film with a lens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Akira Fukano, a researcher at Fuji Photo Film, is displeased when people
talk of the company's 'disposable' cameras. This is a misnomer, he says,
since almost all of the camera is reused or recycled.
The company insists the device be called a 'film with a lens', although when
it was first marketed in 1986 the idea was to throw away the lens and
shutter apparatus once the film was used.
But in 1990, Fuji launched its recycling centre and today more than 70 per
cent of the parts, including the lens, flash and shutter are tested and
reused. Other components, such as the outer cardboard box and batteries, are
sent to outside recycling companies.
Fuji, which has been followed down the recycling path by other photo film
companies, including Konica, Kodak, and Agfa, has about 80 per cent of the
domestic disposable camera market. It invested Y1bn (Pounds 6.27m) in its
first automated line in 1992 and another Y1bn in its fully automated system
the following year.
Earlier this year, it won an award from the ministry of international trade
and industry for its environment-friendly system.
Mr Fukano says the key to the high reusage ratio is product development.
'Recycling parts is fine, but it's better for the environment to reuse the
component as it is,' he says.
This has meant using quality parts, which can be used over and over again,
and meticulous quality testing systems which pick out
used components that are
damaged.
To enable easy dismantling by machines, the components, screwed together in
the original version, are shaped to allow them to be simply fitted together.
To limit the amounts of materials used in a product, miniaturisation has
also been important. The company has reduced the camera weight by 20 per
cent to 40g.
But there are costs for recycling. Fukano admits that a recycled product is
more expensive than a completely new one because of the initial development
costs and the running costs for collection and storage of used cameras.
Fuji, and the other photo film companies, are also facing competition from
the large supermarkets selling their own-brand disposable cameras.
A further problem is that the recycling process relies on the film
processing labs to return used parts to the manufacturers. While this helps
to create a link between consumer and processing lab, some labs, including
those belonging to the large supermarkets, have used the parts from Fuji
cameras, as well as their own, to produce new branded disposable cameras.
After Fuji protests the retailers have agreed to stop, but some independent
labs are still using used parts. For example, Nihon Jumbo, a fast growing
film processing chain, reuses parts from leading manufacturers' products.
The company says it has a right to recycle parts from used cameras and is
not obliged to return them to the maker since the consumer has 'thrown them
away'.
Fuji says, however, that sales of recycled products by processing
laboratories pose little threat to its market position.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Putting value on variety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does biodiversity - the preservation of wide varieties of species - have any
economic value? Since biodiversity was one of the goals adopted by
environmental policymakers at the Rio earth summit, the question is highly
topical.
On the face of it, the answer seems to be no, or very little. A stretch of
rainforest rich in plant, animal and insect life does not have enough value
to prevent people chopping it down and selling the timber for short-term
gain. So how can its value be enhanced to persuade people to leave the
forest alone?
Professor David Pearce, the environmental economist who has made a career
out of pricing the environment, believes it can be done. In a new book* he
says that biodiversity might be able to compete with alternative land uses
if there was greater parity between the two.
The trouble is that alternative uses tend to enjoy special treatment, such
as tax breaks or distorted property rights. 'This,' he writes, 'is one
dominant reason why more investment in biodiversity does not automatically
take place.'
There is a further reason: the absence of what Pearce calls 'global markets
in the benefits of biodiversity'. In particular, developing countries find
it difficult to exploit their biodiversity because no one is willing to pay
enough for it.
For example, industrialised countries do not put a value on the ability of
rainforests in the developing countries to soak up carbon from the
atmosphere. Pearce argues that poorer countries need more help from richer
ones and from multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank's Global
Environment Facility, to extract this value.
Even so, Pearce believes that there are many cases where biodiversity pays:
wetlands with potential for human use, and tropical forests that could yield
between Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,900) and Dollars 7,000 per hectare, which
Pearce says is 'clearly attractive'.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Business and the Environment: Farming the green fields - A
farmer mixing commerce and conservation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 14 years Cyril Cole has been farming in a more environmentally-
friendly way on his mixed-stock farm, Lower Ash Moor, between Tiverton and
South Molton in Devon. He has dug ponds, planted trees and fenced off hedges
to prevent the cows eating them.
Last year he became involved in more extensive conservation when he took
over 30 acres of Culm grassland to manage under the Countryside Commission's
stewardship scheme.
He keeps this land in a traditional state, applying no fertiliser or lime to
the fields - just cutting the grass in August - where more than 130 species
of plants and wild flowers thrive. The scheme pays him Pounds 28 per acre
which goes towards interest on his bank loan for purchasing some of the
land.
Cole's efforts will be recognised today when the farm is announced as the
winner of the Silver Lapwing award sponsored by Booker Countryside, part of
the agribusiness group.
The award is presented annually to the agricultural holding which has done
most to combine wildlife conservation and landscape improvement with a
commercial farming business.
Cole's holding is in a difficult farming area just on the edge of Exmoor. It
has a high rainfall and short grazing season for his 40 dairy cows, 60
cattle and 70 breeding ewes. However, Cole manages to combine many
traditional skills with running a viable business.
He is currently being paid by the Countryside Commission to restore the high
'Devon bank' hedges that flank the grasslands.
Cole trims bushes on the side of hedges to make room for plants such as
heather, honeysuckle and primroses, and digs a ditch at the bottom of the
hedge to provide a moist habitat for toads, frogs and lizards. He has
surrounded many fields with ditches to create 'corridors' for small animals.
Cole has found so much interest in his conservation efforts that he is
considering setting up a farm trail and providing access for local schools.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Better to hire a squirrel than teach a turkey -
Research into competence shows motivation can be as important as
qualifications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cast your mind back a few years, maybe more years than you would care to
count. Can you remember who you regarded as the best teacher in your school?
What were the special qualities this teacher possessed that did not seem to
be present in those who were no more than average?
The chances are that the qualities you identified as something special had
little to do with the usual measures of academic achievement. For example, I
recall a teacher who was particularly good at relating what he taught to
events in the outside world, making the subject appear to have much more
relevance for his pupils.
It was these kind of observations that spurred much of the research carried
out by David McClelland, the Boston-based psychologist, whose behavioural
studies have helped inspire a whole generation of experts working in
management development.
McClelland, chairman of McBer in the US, is 77 now, but still capable of
challenging orthodox educational theory and practices in a way that has not
always endeared him to whatever establishment he has been studying.
His criticism of psychometric testing conflicts with the methods of many
occupational psychologists. 'The trouble with psychometric tests is that
they tell you what a person can do if asked to do it but they don't tell you
what he does do,' he said.
He remains convinced that the study of the way people do their work produces
the best method of finding how they do it best. Hence his definitive work on
the use of competencies in assessment of job performance.
Competency has become a much over-used and confusing word in human resource
management, perhaps because it has been redefined by psychologists and
educationalists beyond its accepted dictionary definition. The confusion has
been exacerbated because of two markedly different areas of work.
One strand, which has been adopted by the British system of National
Vocational Qualifications has its roots in the educational system and
defines competencies as groupings of skills, knowledge and ability.
McClelland's definition is more behaviour-oriented. He defines a competency
as any characteristic of a person that differentiates levels of performance
in a job. Others will define it differently again. It seems to have become
an open market.
McClelland is still able to recall how that word competency came into play
among behavioural psychologists. Robert White, a fellow Harvard professor,
chose to use it in a quite different connection when he was trying to write
about competencies that small children acquired in the course of growing up
 -such things as walking.
'I said that competencies seemed OK to me as a way of describing them and I
began using the word in my own work on testing for competencies rather than
intelligence,' said McClelland.
Asked for a definition himself he ventured: 'A little bit higher than a
skill, more of a motive and a trait, a human characteristic that
differentiates outstanding from typical performance.' Today he says: 'The
currency has become cheapened. People are using it all over the place."
Driven to look at competencies from a state of confusion about what they
actually were, I found that a short publication called Competency Assessment
Methods, by Hay/McBer Research Press, drawn from a paper first presented in
Boston three years ago, neatly summarised much of the work in competency
assessment over the past 30 years.
One of McClelland's approaches was to question the reliance on academic
qualifications in selection. His conclusion was that, while knowledge and
skills could be developed, it was much more difficult to develop the motives
and traits behind the way people do things.
His original work was in looking at small business people - what it was that
made them successful. Most of all, he observed, it was the need for
achievement. They wanted to improve constantly on what they were doing.
He made these observations by asking top performers to write about
particular pictures. No matter what the subject matter of the picture they
would always come round to writing about someone trying to do a better job
in one way or another. The same happened when they were asked to speak on a
particular topic.
A similar process, he found, could be used to sift out other qualities that
distinguished superior performers in different fields. This led to the
development of the behavioural event interview now used by Hay to build up a
specific competency matrix for various jobs and organisations.
These lengthy interviews are held with the best performers in whatever job
is being studied and compared with those of average performers.
Characteristics that mark out the good performers are then drawn from the
comparisons.
The result cannot necessarily be transplanted from one company into another
company because of cultural differences.
Chris Dyson, a director of Hay/McBer in the UK, explained: 'It is not aiming
at cloning jobs. It differentiates between companies. In two fast-moving
consumer goods companies we looked at, for example, an important competency
in one company was to have a political awareness. You needed to know what
you could and could not say to whom. The second company had an entirely
different approach and insisted upon absolute honesty as a prerequisite.'
While some of the competencies for each of these companies were compatible,
by no means all of them were and the most important culturally-related
competencies were poles apart.
The competencies necessary for particular jobs are far from obvious. Dyson
cites a high-class departmental store seeking to discover the key
competencies of its merchandise buyers. The management believed that being a
good negotiator would perhaps be most valuable in that it would enable the
buyer to drive down the price paid to the supplier. Hay discovered that the
cost of the goods to the store was less important than whether the shop
could sell the merchandise with little left over at the end of the sales
cycle.
The most successful buyers, it found, were those who could empathise with
the customers and understood what the customer was looking for.
In another study McClelland looked at the most successful characteristics
that marked out the best performers in the US State Department foreign
service. The good ones were able to relate closely to the cultures of the
host countries.
When he looked at the service's selection methods he noticed that the
elegant use of English was highly prized and thus reflected in the testing
procedure. It was the sort of English fostered at Harvard, Princeton and
Yale and tended to discriminate against minorities who might not have
achieved the same educational standards.
McClelland found that those minorities who had scraped into the service by
some side route performed just as well as other officers.
Such work has led to the observation in the Hay booklet that: "From a cost
effectiveness standpoint, the rule is hire for core motivation and trait
characteristics, and develop knowledge and skills. Most organisations do the
reverse: they hire on the basis of educational credentials and assume that
candidates come with or can be indoctrinated with the appropriate motives or
traits."
Dyson puts it another way, quoting a friend: 'You can teach a turkey to
climb a tree but it's easier to hire a squirrel.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / Mortgage lending sinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total mortgage lending fell sharply last month compared with August,
emphasising the fragile nature of the housing market recovery, Barclays Bank
said yesterday.
The bank said in a survey that solicitors' home-loan transactions indicated
that gross new mortgage advances in England fell 7 per cent last month
compared with August.
The figures reflected the completion of loans negotiated in early and
mid-summer before last month's rise of half a percentage point in interest
rates.
Mr Garry Skelton, head of Barclays mortgage lending, said: 'It is too early
to judge the impact of the rate rise, but it does not augur well for October
lending. For most people increases in monthly mortgage repayments have yet
to take effect.'
He said the bank had seen a sharp increase in demand for fixed-rate
mortgages since the rise, but mortgage applications overall last month were
about the same level as in August.
'Traditionally we would expect mortgage applications to increase in
September and October but, for one reason or another, this has not happened
during the past few years,' said Mr Skelton.
Barclays blamed uncertainty about job prospects and the economy as well as
tax and fixed-rate mortgage rises earlier in the year for the decline in
mortgage completions since August - even though completions last month were
9 per cent higher than September last year.
The biggest fall was in Greater London where mortgage lending fell 10.6 per
cent compared with August and 7.6 per cent compared with September last
year. Only the south-west region saw an increase in lending - of 5.6 per
cent compared with August.
'Overall housing market activity appears largely to be concentrated among
first-time buyers, new properties and at the upper end of the market,' said
Mr Skelton.
House prices have remained static since the third quarter of last year
according to a survey published today by Halifax Building Society. Regions
showing the strongest growth in prices over the period were Northern Ireland
(+9 per cent), Scotland (+3.4 per cent), Greater London (+1.8 per cent) and
south-east England (+1.6 per cent).

FT  12 OCT 94 / Shake-up urged for cathedrals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Church of England's cathedrals should be more professional in attracting
visitors and selling themselves, the Archbishops' Commission of Cathedrals
said yesterday.
The commission said better financial planning and management was crucial to
the running of the 42 cathedrals, which were failing to make best use of
resources.
It urged the abolition of the freehold for future cathedral clergy posts,
ending the 'job-for-life' policy. But it warned against 'slavish adoption of
business techniques' and said decisions on entry charges must be left to
individual cathedrals.
The commission, chaired by Lady Howe, recommended wide-ranging reform of
cathedral government in order to help achieve greater openness and
accountability.
The report, Heritage and Renewal, rejected suggestions that cathedrals were
in crisis. It endorsed their role as 'the seat of the bishop and a centre of
worship and mission'.
The compilers of the document admitted that long-standing organisational
arrangements failed to meet contemporary needs - and suggested a simple
framework for future governance.
Under the proposals each cathedral would be governed by a council with
members drawn from people with different interests in the institution. The
diocesan bishop would chair the council and an outside administrator would
head a four-person administrative team which would include lay people.
The study also called for better training for cathedral clergy, lay staff
and volunteers - and urged the creation of a commission to offer advice on
best practice.
Lady Howe said yesterday the commission had found that cathedrals were 'in
good heart, but in need of significant change'. The review, the first of its
kind for 70 years, 'did not propose a break or discontinuity with the past,
but rather organic change and development'.
The Church of England's cathedrals were among the 'spiritual and
architectural glories' of the nation, she added. But while worship and music
were 'generally superb', the picture was 'less satisfactory' elsewhere and
the governance of cathedrals was 'complex and confusing'.
Lady Howe said: 'Overall, the finances of cathedrals, while not in jeopardy,
are less than comfortable. There is scope, too, for improved financial
planning and management. There is also considerable variation between
cathedrals in the performance of their trading and visitor activities.'
The commission wanted to see a cut in legal red tape and clearer, more
precise management arrangements.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Loyalty of readers to newspapers is questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Newspaper readers are far less loyal to individual titles than previously
thought, Taylor Nelson AGB, the market research group, said.
Even before steep cuts in the prices of The Sun and The Times there was far
more movement in newspaper readership than previously supposed, said the
group.
'Far from newspapers being a stable market, it is highly turbulent,' Mr
Stephan Buck, a director of Taylor Nelson AGB, said yesterday.
The company surveyed loyal newspaper readers in June last year, before the
price war started, and in March this year. The Daily Telegraph and Daily
Mirror both gained 15 per cent of new loyal readers over the period, but
lost 24 per cent. The cut-price Times lost 35 per cent of its previously
loyal readers but gained 64 per cent, giving a net increase of 29 per cent
in the period.
Mr Buck believes that, even though official Audit Bureau of Circulation and
National Readership Survey figures might show no significant net gains or
losses, newspapers could still lose and gain about 20 per cent of their
'loyal' readership in a year.
'No wonder heavy price-cutting brought in significant numbers of new regular
purchasers, just as it would in any other fast-moving consumer goods
market,' Mr Buck said.
The research was based on the Taylor Nelson AGB Mediaspan system which
regularly monitors the purchases of a panel of 8,500 households.
A different project by RSGB, part of Taylor Nelson AGB, found the highest
level of readership commitment was to The Guardian and the lowest broadsheet
commitment was to The Independent and The Times.
Healds, the convenience-store chain in north-west England, is selling
newspapers at half price until Christmas.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Regulator lays down rules for train operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules for train operating companies seeking to negotiate access to the
railway network owned by Railtrack were set out yesterday by Mr John Swift
QC, the rail regulator.
The handbook sets criteria for agreeing the details of timetables,
performance incentives and track maintenance standards. It sets great store
by open competition and flexible contracts.
The guidelines have emerged from talks between the train operators and
Railtrack and will be applied to future negotiations as the operators move
into the private sector.
The aim is to ensure that agreements are reached which protect the interests
of travellers; promote the development of the rail network; and enable
companies providing railway services to plan for the future.
Issues on which the document sets rules include:
Access agreements must be flexible enough to allow for effective railway
operations without the need continually to consult the regulator. But they
should not allow agreements which deliberately flout the regulator's
intentions.
Agreements must contain a 'reopener provision' to allow changes to be made
to, for example, franchise periods and levels of charges, when the regulator
publishes policy statements in November and April.
Timetables which make it difficult for Railtrack to franchise routes to
other operators would be subject to very close scrutiny.
Railtrack will be expected to show that it has plans to renew track which
matches the sums it sets aside for depreciation in its accounts. Agreements
must also include clauses which provide an incentive to Railtrack to improve
the performance of the track network.
Railtrack and the train operators must negotiate agreements which compensate
the train operators if maintenance work takes longer than planned and they
are unable to use the track.
Train operators will be expected to adopt flexible computer networks which
do not tie them into expensive and inappropriate systems.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Truck and van sales show ninth successive rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial vehicle registrations rose for the ninth successive month in
September, providing only tentative signs that a slowdown in the rate of
recovery of the new-car market might be spreading to parts of the van and
truck market.
Registrations of trucks over 3.5 tonnes did fall in September - by 12.2 per
cent to 4,443 from 5,059 in the same period a year ago. But this was
attributable entirely to sales during the previous September being inflated
by a rush to register vehicles which would not have met new emissions
regulations introduced on October 1 last year.
In contrast, registrations of light vans last month jumped by 40.6 per cent,
to 5,230 from 3,719, while those of panel vans such as the Ford Transit were
12.3 per cent higher at 8,464 compared with the previous September's 7,537.
Registrations of light four-wheel-drive utility vehicles also fell slightly
last month, to 1,210 from 1,322 a year ago, although for the first three
quarters of the year as a whole they were half a percentage point higher at
10,775.
Statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that the
bus and coach market was static last month compared with levels achieved a
year ago at 235 against 234, but this sector is also up - by 18.1 per cent
at 2,145 for the first nine months as a whole.
The share of the total commercial vehicle market taken by imports rose last
month to 45.4 per cent compared with 43.8 per cent a year ago, lifting the
year-to-date level to 43.6 per cent from the 41.13 of the first nine months
of last year.
However, the figure conceals a very sharp rise in the penetration of the
truck market by importers anxious to compensate for the steep recession in
Continental truck markets. Their share jumped to more than 58 per cent last
month compared with just over 47 per cent a year ago.
Among those making the biggest gains in the month were Scania, with
registrations up 22.8 per cent, Renault up 44.3, and Mercedes-Benz up 12.7.
All the UK-based truck manufacturers saw their registrations slip back with
the sole exception of ERF, the UK's last independent publicly quoted
truckmaker. It achieved a 3.8 per cent rise in registrations.
In the vans sector LDV, the former Leyland DAF operation rescued from
receivership last year, continued its own recovery - registrations last
month rose 50 per cent to 1,450 from 967 a year ago.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Jobs to be lost at BR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions expect to be told next week that more than 1,500 white-collar workers
will lose their jobs at British Rail Infrastructure Services over the next
six months as it is split into 20 separate companies prior to privatisation.
British Rail yesterday admitted there would be job losses but refused to
confirm the figure. Unions believe the main victims will be managerial and
administrative staff.
BRIS is subcontracted by Railtrack to maintain track and signalling work.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Police chief raps funding reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A proposed new government formula for funding the police is 'fundamentally
flawed', Mr Jim Sharples, Merseyside chief constable, warned yesterday.
Merseyside Police Authority yesterday held an emergency meeting to discuss
the crisis. Mr Norman Williams, the Tory chairman, said the cuts 'defy
logic', and is seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Michael Howard, the home
secretary.
The Merseyside force believes it is set to become one of the worst victims
of the new formula.
Mr Sharples has warned Mr Howard and other ministers that the formula would
have too detrimental an impact on Merseyside when implemented on April 1
next year.
Among factors used in the formula are recorded crime, which has been
dropping on Merseyside for eight years, and population, which has also
declined steadily.
He warned: 'If you begin to tamper with the strength of that force or reduce
its effectiveness then there must be some impact on the crime figures.'
Faced with the loss of Pounds 13m from his budget, Mr Sharples said at least
500 of his 4,600 officers from all ranks, but mainly constables, would have
to go, along with 100 of his 1,000 civilian support staff.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Payouts from Law Society reach record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Society paid a record Pounds 22.7m compensation for solicitors'
dishonesty last year, the annual report of the Solicitors Complaints Bureau
showed yesterday.
The bureau blames falling incomes in the profession as a result of the
recession for a sharp increase in complaints of poor service and alleged
dishonesty by solicitors.
Complaints rose 15 per cent to 19,582, and the number of firms accused of
dishonesty rose 14 per cent.
The record Pounds 22.7m payment of compensation to the clients of dishonest
solicitors represents a 52 per cent increase on the 1992 figure. The bureau
also reports that applications to the Society's Compensation Fund have risen
this year.
The bureau was forced to intervene in the running of 85 firms last year, an
increase of 20 per cent over the 1992 figure. It investigated 516 firms'
accounts and in nearly 60 per cent of cases it found material breaches of
the solicitors' accounts rules. Investigations revealed instances of
mortgage fraud, advance fee fraud, breaches of undertakings and money
laundering.
There was also a rise in the number of disciplinary actions taken against
solicitors. Mrs Veronica Lowe, the bureau's head, said however that there
had been a significant improvement in complaints handling.
The bureau had disposed of more than 18,000 complaints and 70 per cent had
been dealt with without the need for a formal investigation.
Mr Michael Barnes, the legal services ombudsman, criticised the bureau
earlier this year for placing too much emphasis on tracking down fraudsters
at the expense of dealing with the mass of complaints about poor service and
delays.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Reynolds presses Major on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday called for 'an
accelerated British response' to the six-week-old IRA ceasefire.
In the wake of the assertion by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary, that the British government may never be in a position to say it
accepts that the IRA ceasefire is permanent, Mr Reynolds told the Dublin
parliament he was convinced that the end of IRA violence was 'real and for
good'.
He said he would be in touch with Mr John Major later this week to explain
'that we believe the peace process should be consolidated and underpinned at
the earliest possible moment because if any vacuums develop, the process
could be endangered - and we don't want to see that happen'.
Mr Reynolds also said he was 'encouraged' by signs of a loyalist ceasefire.
There was fresh optimism in Northern Ireland last night within the fringes
of the paramilitaries after the Government allowed loyalist leaders into the
top-security Maze Prison on Monday for talks about a possible ceasefire with
UDA and UVF inmates.
Mr Reynolds, replying to a series of questions on the search for peace in
Northern Ireland, told the parliament of his forthcoming contact with Mr
Major: 'I will be making the point that I believe the time has come now,
into the sixth week of the cessation of violence, to accelerate the response
of the British government.
'Also that the British government should use whatever pressures they can in
relation to an end of violence by loyalist paramilitaries.'
But he also made clear that Sinn Fein had been told that Dublin disapproved
of the steep rise in punishment beatings carried out by republican
hardliners since the ceasefire began on September 1.
Mr Reynolds said it was expected that a framework for all-party,
cross-border talks would be completed ahead of a meeting soon with Mr Major.
'The intention is that the discussions and negotiations on the document will
be over before we fix a definitive date for the meeting,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Drinks groups give Virgin Cola a sceptical welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Virgin Cola, Mr Richard Branson's latest enterprise, was greeted sceptically
yesterday by other soft-drink makers. They look forward to the competition
but wonder how Virgin and Cott, its Canadian partner, will crack
distribution and sales problems.
The Virgin Cola Company is a 50-50 joint venture between Virgin Trading
Company, a new Virgin subsidiary, and Cott. Virgin will be primarily
responsible for marketing, promotion and advertising. Cott will develop,
manufacture and distribute the drinks.
'We invented Cola wars,' PepsiCo said. 'We're very used to competition
because it builds the whole cola market.' Its cola volume has grown 15 per
cent this year in spite of competition from J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola,
also made by Cott.
Distribution will be one critical issue, PepsiCo added. 'Putting the product
within arm's reach of desire' requires a complex distribution system to
reach retailers.
'Physical distribution is not a problem for us,' said Mr Simon Lester,
managing director of Cott Europe.
On the sales side, 'the independent trade has shown an enormous amount of
interest, and we've already spoken to one or two multiples,' he said.
Mr Lester stressed that Cott's link with Virgin was fundamentally different
from its relationship with Sainsbury. With Virgin, Cott is aiming to build
from scratch a new brand, largely for independent retailers. With Sainsbury,
it is supplying a supermarket own-label cola using a different formula.
'We have no objection to this,' Sainsbury said. 'We have an exclusive blend
we will develop with Cott and we've got the better blend compared with
Virgin's'
Mr Lester said Cott was working with some half-dozen bottlers in the UK and
on the Continent on its range of products besides bottling them at Ben Shaw,
its Yorkshire subsidiary.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Curbs on US flights removed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday lifted all restrictions on transatlantic flights to
regional airports in an effort to revive talks with the US on liberalising
air services between the two countries.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, called the decision 'the most
sweeping unilateral liberalisation move in the history of transatlantic
aviation'.
But UK and US airlines regarded the announcement as only a 'welcome gesture'
which did little to advance the core issue of liberalising access to
Heathrow and Gatwick, the two main London airports.
The US government walked away from 'open skies' negotiations last December
after the UK refused to grant immediate access to all US carriers to
Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport.
Dr Mawhinney also called on the US government to agree the liberalisation of
so-called code-sharing arrangements between UK and US carriers. These
marketing tools enable airlines to combine their respective networks by
using each other's ticketing codes.
This would clear the way for US government approval of the proposed
commercial and code-sharing partnership between the UK's Virgin Atlantic
Airways and Delta Air Lines, the third-largest US carrier.
Dr Mawhinney said the move showed the government's commitment to eventual
total liberalisation of transatlantic air services. However, airline
industry officials suggested that the decision was aimed at winning
political support in the regions which have been seeking to expand air
services to boost economic development.
American Airlines, the second largest US carrier, said: 'The nub remains
access to Heathrow and beyond Heathrow'. The US carrier is also opposed to
code-sharing because it sees these arrangements as a device to circumvent
restrictions imposed by bilateral agreements it wants changed.
UK and US carriers have not been rushing to start new services from regional
airports, but have continued to concentrate their operations at Heathrow and
Gatwick.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, said Dr Mawhinney had made 'a bold
gesture without asking anything in return from the US'.

FT  12 OCT 94 / United ends its Glasgow service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines is to withdraw its daily service between Glasgow and
Washington DC at the end of November, only 18 months after it was launched.
It is the third airline in three months to announce the withdrawal or
curtailment of transatlantic flights from Scotland.
United said it was losing money on the route and wanted to redeploy its
aircraft in more profitable markets. It said it had achieved high
peak-season load factors, but yields were low because of the shortage of
passengers paying premium fares. It sells fewer than two business class
seats a day in Scotland and five in the US.
The departure of United Airlines will leave only British Airways flying all
through the year from Glasgow to the US. Later this month Northwest Airlines
will cease its daily Glasgow-Boston service after 14 years, and American
Airlines is to operate its daily Glasgow-Chicago service in the summer only,
ending its all-year service on November 2.
The airlines' decisions are a serious blow to long-running efforts by BAA,
which runs Glasgow airport, and the development body Scottish Enterprise to
attract transatlantic services to Glasgow. It was felt direct flights would
benefit Scottish consumers and make it easier to attract US companies to
open plants in Scotland.
United said too many Scots preferred to fly to the US via London or
Continental airports. Mr David Coltman, vice-president for transatlantic
services, added: 'Scottish business travellers are very cost-conscious. They
will put up with restrictions such as staying over a weekend in order to get
a lower fare.'
Manchester airport is also seeing a reduction in long-haul services this
winter, with BA ending flights to Los Angeles and American Airlines making
its New York service summer only. South African Airlines is ceasing to fly
from Manchester to Johannesburg.

The cost of car and house insurance policies would have fallen in the past
three months if the government had not imposed a 2.5 per cent tax on
premiums from this month, AA Insurance said yesterday.
During 1992 and last year both car and home and house-contents insurance
premiums increased sharply but that trend appears to have been reversed as
the market has returned to profitability, the AA said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Jury told of passport 'racket'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A barrister and a solicitor ran a multi-million-dollar passport racket
preying on the fears of wealthy Hong Kong residents desperate to leave
before China's 1997 takeover, a court heard yesterday.
Numerous documents were forged and the Home Office was 'fooled' repeatedly,
Southwark Crown Court was told.
For nearly three years Mr James Walker, a solicitor, and barrister Mr Paul
Samrai got away with the 'scam' which enabled dozens of people to get the
right to live in Britain, said Mr Brendon Finucane, prosecuting.
He alleged that their company, charging about Pounds 40,000 for each
application, made a total of Pounds 1.36m, most of which was obtained
illegally. The case continues.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Job study finds race bias evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A study of racial discrimination in job recruitment in Nottingham has found
the chances of getting an interview were twice as high among white
applicants than among black or Asian candidates, Richard Donkin writes.
The study by the Nottingham and District Racial Equality Council submitted
three fictitious applications for each of 281 job vacancies. The candidates,
one white, one black and one Asian, were evenly matched.
In the 38 cases where only one applicant was offered an interview, 30 of the
employers picked the white applicant, five chose the Asian, and one chose
the black candidate.
In another case letters of application were sent to an insurance company
seeking a sales representative.
The white jobseeker received an application form on the first day of the
month asking him to contact the company for the interview. The other two
applicants did not receive the form until the 11th of the next month, a full
six weeks after the white applicant. There was no offer of an interview with
the forms. The company described itself as an equal-opportunity employer.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Branson to inject fizz into his product range: Why Virgin's
tactics would seem more familiar in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What has a cola drink to do with an airline, radio station, music store or
computer game, and what have any of these activities to do with each other?
Virgin's move into soft drinks, announced yesterday , looks distinctly out
of step with the management vogue for paring down activities.
But the company would argue that it is the Virgin 'attribute-based' rather
than 'product-based' brand name which holds all these diverse activities
together.
The Virgin name does not mean a specific product to the public, but is
associated with fun, friendliness, doing things differently, quality and
price competitiveness, said Mr Will Whitehorn, Virgin's corporate affairs
director. These attributes mean the brand can be applied to a diverse range
of products, he added.
These claims for the attributes of the Virgin name were given some
independent credence recently by an NOP poll conducted for the trade journal
PR Week. In two separate surveys it found that about 80 per cent of
respondents associated the Virgin name with friendliness, nearly the same
proportion with high quality, and between 60 per cent and 70 per cent with
innovation, fun and low prices.
Virgin's tactics may seem odd by the management standards of western
businesses but would be familiar to the Japanese, said Mr Whitehorn. He
points to the keiretsu, or corporate family formation, of Japanese
businesses. 'Western companies tend to work in pyramidal structures,
dominated by a holding company at the top. The keiretsu structure is flat
and dominated by attribute-based brands. There is some communality of
ownership but freedom among each of the units to make its own joint venture
deals,' he said.
An example is Mitsubishi, which is a bank and a car, as well as a
shipbuilding and electronics company. All are part of the same family or
keiretsu interest.
Virgin's aim is to ensure that all its products and services match and
exploit the brand attributes and are, broadly speaking, in the leisure area.
Its computer games company has given the brand a presence in the youth
market. Its link-up with ICL, announced last month, will mean the production
of Virgin computers slanted towards and games and multimedia markets.
The vodka tie-up with William Grant, also announced last month, fits the
objectives for the Virgin brand, as does yesterday's cola announcement.
Mr Whitehorn dismisses suggestions that the Virgin name could be weakened by
diversifying into so many different areas. 'We've never really used the
brand on consumer products until now. You can buy very few products,
considering the number of trading activities we're involved in. What we
haven't worked out yet is where to draw the line. We're taking it on a
case-by-case basis,' he said.
But is Virgin using the wrong name and should it re-brand itself as Branson?
The PR Week survey suggests this might not be as ridiculous as it sounds.
While 93 per cent of respondents recognised the name Virgin, 97 per cent
knew the name of Branson, and 34 per cent said they would be more likely to
buy a Virgin product or service because of their high opinion of Branson.
A recent MORI poll for the BBC rated him as one of the figures - along with
Mother Teresa - that young people would most trust to revise the Ten
Commandments. Mr Whitehorn believes that the identification of Mr Branson
with Virgin is particularly strong in the British public's mind, but this is
not the case in Japan, the US or elsewhere in Europe.
'Richard has been very important to the brand name and has helped to
establish its key values. But the strength of the brand transcends his
involvement, especially overseas.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / Stores pump up the volume: The battle for petrol sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a new television advertisement, the engine leaps out of a car, zooms to
the nearest BP garage and fills itself with petrol.
The message of the advertisement, devised by Mr Joe Johnston, the Hollywood
director of Honey I Shrunk the Kids fame, is supposed to be that cars know
BP is the best, and best-value, place to buy petrol. As it was launched, Mr
Rolf Stomberg, chief executive of BP Oil Europe, said BP was backing the
campaign by matching at selected outlets the cheap prices of petrol sold by
supermarkets.
'We are fed up with the growth in volumes achieved by hypermarkets and the
erosion of our market share,' he said. 'We are taking them on.'
BP's promise to match supermarket petrol prices is the latest skirmish in a
long battle between the big oil companies and supermarket chains.
Since the late 1980s, large retailers such as Sainsbury, Safeway, Tesco and
Asda have opened more than 500 supermarket filling stations. Although they
account for only a fraction of the total of 19,000 petrol stations in the
UK, supermarket filling stations have increased their volume share of the
retail petrol market from 6 per cent to almost 20 per cent within the last
three years by selling at a discount.
But the likelihood of a protracted price war in the UK is small. Many in the
industry doubt that BP will be able to halt erosion of its market share for
long. 'Supermarket prices will always be below those of the major brands,'
said one industry observer. 'They are trying to stop the unstoppable.'
Supermarkets have a number of advantages over the oil companies. Their
market share is such that their purchasing power at the refineries is
similar to that of the marketing arms of the oil companies themselves. The
high volumes purchased means they enjoy good credit terms from refineries.
By concentrating on a few high-volume sites, they can use large, economical
tankers to fill large storage tanks. Oil companies typically have to pay a
dealer or tenant to run their site, whereas supermarkets have to pay only a
cashier.
No supermarket sites are more than a few years old, so there is little need
for the costly maintenance required at the generally older company-owned
stations. There are also environmental clean-up costs at the latter when
they are closed or refurbished.
Those advantages allow supermarkets to offer average savings of about 3p a
litre according to figures from Opal Oil Price Assessments, which monitors
retail fuel markets in Europe.
Intense local competition usually means the differential at company stations
near a supermarket outlet falls to about 1p a litre.
That local competition has also added to a widening of price differentials.
Figures from Opal show that the highest price of four-star petrol was 61.9p
a litre last week compared with a low of 52.9p and a supermarket average of
54.2p.
In addition to lowering prices in some areas, the main response of the oil
companies has been to question the quality of the petrol sold by the
supermarkets. Even though all the petrol sold by supermarkets comes from
refineries owned by the oil companies, it previously did not contain
additives to make it flow more smoothly and prolong engine life. Sainsbury
began mixing additives to its petrol last year, and other retailers are
following suit.
A better route for improving the profitability of oil company petrol
stations is to take on the retailers at their own game - selling consumer
goods. Oil groups are finding that adding pop-in, top-up shopping outlets
can transform the profitability of sites previously dependent on low-margin
petrol sales.
According to a report from Corporate Intelligence, the turnover in petrol
forecourt shops was Pounds 1.7bn in 1992 and is growing at more than 10 per
cent a year.
Shell, for example, is opening five convenience stores a week, and has begun
promoting its stations as retail outlets, advertising price promotions on
such products as Coca-Cola. Groups including BP, Mobil and Texaco are doing
the same.
At the same time, retailers are encroaching increasingly on to oil
companies' territory. With scope for building new superstores shrinking,
Tesco has opened two standalone petrol stations in London, both with 2,000
sq ft Tesco Express convenience stores attached. Sainsbury is reported to be
looking for petrol station sites, too.
Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil market analysts, published a report
in August suggesting supermarkets were poised to become significant
retailers of petrol. That could make dropping into filling stations for an
extra pint of milk or loaf of bread commonplace. It also means future price
battles between retailers and oil companies may not just be about petrol,
but about soft drinks, crisps and baked beans.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Jury told of Pounds 1.36m passport 'racket'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A barrister and a solicitor ran a multi-million-dollar passport racket
preying on the fears of wealthy Hong Kong residents desperate to leave
before China's 1997 takeover, a court heard yesterday.
Numerous documents were forged and the Home Office 'fooled' repeatedly,
Southwark Crown Court was told.
For nearly three years Mr James Walker, a solicitor, and barrister Mr Paul
Samrai got away with the 'scam' which enabled dozens of people to get the
right to live in Britain, said Mr Brendon Finucane, prosecuting.
He alleged that altogether the men's company, charging about Pounds 40,000
for each application, made a total of Pounds 1.36m, most of which was
obtained illegally.
Mr Finucane told the jury that Mr Samrai and Mr Walker - the only one before
the court - and others, set up a Hong Kong-based operation.
Mr Samrai saw customers in the colony and then forwarded often false
documentation to Mr Walker in Britain.
Once they reached the solicitor's office at a London law firm Mr Walker
signed them knowing many were bogus, claimed Mr Finucane.
Trading on the 'trust and integrity' his profession attracted, he then
submitted them to an 'overworked' Home Office immigration department as part
of applications for 'right of abode' in Britain or 'indefinite leave to
remain'.
Counsel claimed 'certificates of entitlement' were subsequently issued.
Mr Finucane told the court that Mr Samrai and Mr Walker set up the business
initially without any dishonest intentions. The case continues

FT  12 OCT 94 / Disabled fail to take up benefit for job searches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A social security benefit launched more than two years ago to help disabled
people find jobs has attracted only a fraction of the claimants the
government expected.
At the time of its launch in April 1992, ministers said they expected about
50,000 people to claim the Disability Working Allowance. A report by the
independent Policy Studies Institute, published today, however, shows that
only 4,300 people are receiving the benefit.
The report said that while 250,000 disabled people are thought to be looking
for work, only a few hundred had moved into work as a direct result of the
allowance and only about a third of those hoping to find work had heard of
the allowance.
It estimated a sixth of those eligible were actually receiving the benefit.
Most of those who had obtained it, were already in work before they heard of
it - a means-tested top-up benefit similar to Income Support.
Another problem was that most disabled people wanted to work full-time,
whereas the allowance mainly helped part-timers.
The researchers also found that some disabled workers were earning too much
to come within the scope of the benefit. Single people earning more than
Pounds 108 can no longer claim benefit. The rules also favour people who
claim soon after finding a job.
Ms Karen Rowlingson, co-author of the report, said: 'The Disability Working
Allowance has helped a few disabled people find jobs. But this is just the
tip of the iceberg compared with the number who want to work.'
The study was based on a postal survey of 7,000 people on sickness or
disability benefits, interviews with 1,500 workers and 1,000 allowance
claimants.
The Department of Social Security said it would study the report. It added:
'The benefit was only introduced in 1992. It will take time to be accepted.'

Dr Brian Mawhinney, trans-port secretary, yesterday reassured owners of
classic and vintage vehicles that he would not order a much criticised
extension of vehicle excise duty without public consultation.
Owners of seasonally used vehicles or those off the road while being
restored had expressed concern about proposed measures to cut the Pounds
145m annual cost of evasion.
In July the Department of Transport announced that it planned to require
that cars and motorcycles have a current tax disc at all times, regardless
of whether they were in use.
Dr Mawhinney said: 'I am very aware of the fears voiced by owners of classic
and vintage vehicles and am looking at what sensible arrangements can be
made to cover those kind of concerns.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A colliery which closed more than a year ago is heading for a profit just
three months after being reopened following a management buy-out.
Managers at the Betws mine in Ammanford, Dyfed, said yesterday it would be
in profit by Christmas. They said the colliery had already reached full
production of 2,500 tonnes of anthracite each week.
The pit reopened in a Pounds 3m buy-out in June after being closed by
British Coal last January with the loss of 114 jobs.
Betws now has orders for every tonne of output for the next five years.
Betws Anthracite was reopened in a management buy-out by four former British
Coal managers who now employ 91 miners and 14 staff.

Unison, Britain's biggest union, is to urge an industrial tribunal to refer

Unison wants to establish future pension rights for public-sector workers
transferred to private companies under compulsory competitive tendering.
The case involves Mr Richard Doughty, a gravedigger whose job was contracted
from Rotherham borough council to a company which did not offer a pension
scheme.
Unison will ask an industrial tribunal in Sheffield tomorrow to refer the
case to Europe for a ruling that the company should provide a comparable
pension to the local government superannuation scheme.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Judges split as Kelman wins Booker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNALENA MCAFEE, Arts and Literary Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as 'mad' by
one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr
James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.
The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian
dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have
damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and -
worst of all - unsaleable.
Professor John Bayley, chairman of the Booker judges, acknowledged that Mr
Kelman's book in particular might be deemed inaccessible. 'We had an
extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided,' he said after
three hours of debate.
Rabbi Julia Neuberger, the only woman on the judging panel, said she was
made extremely cross by the decision. 'It's just a drunken Scotsman railing
against bureaucracy,' she said. 'My eyes are stretched in disbelief. The
voting system is completely mad. Kelman was the least favourite of the three
front runners. If it had been a short story it would have been fine.'
Mr Kelman's book is, according to some observers, the most difficult work to
have won the prize. In his acceptance speech, Mr Kelman, perceived by some
as a Scottish isolationist, anticipated the criticism, by declaring: 'My
culture and my language have the right to exist.'
One guest at the prize-giving dinner at London's Guildhall, Mr Salman
Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnight's Children, remarked:
'James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.'
The Booker prize has, in its 26-year history, always provoked controversy.
But this year's rows have been of a particularly fine vintage.
Prof Bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary
fiction. Another judge, Mr James Wood, literary critic of The Guardian, was
attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for
the award, Ms Claire Messud, was in fact Mrs James Wood.
Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the
shortlist as narcoleptic. The other contenders were The Folding Star by Alan
Hollinghurst, Beside the Ocean of Time by George Mackay Brown, Paradise by
Abdulrazak Gurnah, Reef by Romesh Gunesekera and Knowledge of Angels by Jill
Paton Walsh.
In spite of heavy publicity, the novels nominated have been selling 50 per
cent less than last year's shortlist. Last year's winner, Roddy Doyle's
Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, sold 350,000 copies. 'Kelman's novel is unlikely to
come anywhere near that,' one bookseller said.
Mr Kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in 1989 for his novel A
Disaffection.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Staff at ITV station given notice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television last night began issuing dismissal notices to
employees who have not unconditionally accepted new terms and conditions
designed to cut the company's costs.
The company's letter, giving notice of termination of contract, said
employees who had not signed their agreement to the new terms were not
required to work their notice period, but would be re-instated if they
agreed to the new conditions.
Unions insisted the company was acting unlawfully and advised members not to
be forced into signing.
But the company said its actions were consistent with 'eminent legal advice'
and wholly within the law. 'More importantly they are designed to secure the
future of the company and all those who want to continue working with us.
'Security of employment for staff and a competitive company operation cannot
not be achieved without abandoning some of the practices of the eighties.'
The issue, it said, was one of realism. 'If after further consideration
there are still those who do not accept our proposals to secure the future,
we can only look upon their departure with regret.'
The company declined to say how many of its 800 employees had signed.
The notices of termination sent out last night were to Yorkshire employees.
The 200 Tyne Tees employees face a deadline of 4pm today.
The company, whose employees work an annualised hours system, wants to scrap
premium rate overtime payments, and pay additional hours at flat rate. The
unions say this would mean some employees' earnings would drop by up to 40
per cent. They say the changes would also scrap safeguards agreed when
annualised hours were introduced.
Unions at the company are talking legal advice on their next move. Mr Colin
Bourne, the National Union of Journalists' northern region organiser, said
the law defined the dismissals as redundancies.
'People now have the right to claim damages for breach of contract, to claim
unfair dismissal and payment in lieu of the period for which the company is
legally required to consult with the unions,' he said.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Pools win jackpot concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday spelled out concessions to football pools
operators, including a partial right to rollover jackpots when there is no
outright winner.
The number of jackpots the football pools operators will be able to roll
over will, however, be dictated by the number of rollovers in the National
Lottery which will be launched next month.
It is believed that the Department of National Heritage argued for such
limits to protect the lottery from pools competition.
When there is no overall winner in the National Lottery and the main prize,
which could be about Pounds 2m, is rolled over to the following week, the
pools companies get a 'rollover credit'.
If there is no pools jackpot winner the pools companies can use the credit
to roll over the weekly jackpot - up to Pounds 750,000 for Vernons and
Pounds 2m for Littlewoods - within a six-month time limit.
Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons, said last night: 'Obviously
we are delighted at the movement in the direction of liberalising the rules.
It is still not the complete deregulation we anticipated when rollovers were
promised.'
The order bringing the changes into effect also reduces the age limit for
those able to play the football pools from 18 to 16.
Newsagents, shops and betting offices will also be able to act as agents for
the pools companies for the first time.
Pools companies will be watching to see what effect the launch of the
National Lottery has on their business and may yet return to the government
to seek further concessions.
Mr Michael Forsyth, Home Office minister, said yesterday that the right to
hand football coupons in to local retail outlets 'will provide the small
shop with the chance to benefit from an extra source of revenue'.
National Lottery tickets will be available at about 10,000 outlets at its
launch, a network that will grow to more than 35,000.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Corporate member to sit on Lloyd's ruling body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first representative of the new corporate investors in Lloyd's of London
has been elected to the insurance market's rulemaking and disciplinary
council.
Mr Jonathan Agnew's unopposed election marks a further rise in the influence
of corporate capital at Lloyd's - as opposed to individual Names whose
assets have traditionally supported the market.
Mr Agnew is chairman of London Insurance Market Investment Trust, the
largest of the new corporate capital groups at Lloyd's.
This year 25 corporate vehicles are underwriting about Pounds 1.6bn of
premiums out of the market's total capacity of Pounds 10.9bn. Both the
number of corporate vehicles and amount of capital underwritten by corporate
representatives are expected to rise next year.
An important hurdle will be the application for stock-market listings of
'dedicated' funds, which provide capital for a narrow range of syndicates.
So far listed funds have been investment trusts supporting a range of
agencies and the syndicates they manage.
Mr Agnew, former group chief executive at Kleinwort Benson, the merchant
bank, stressed the importance of a 'diversity' of capital at Lloyd's -
including from non-corporate members.
Elections for five other places on the council are being contested.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Hurd in Kuwait for talks on Iraqi build-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, flew to Kuwait last night for talks
with Gulf ministers and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, on
the build-up of Iraqi troops along the contested border between Kuwait and
Iraq.
Mr Hurd told the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth that he would
fly to Saudi Arabia for further talks after meeting the foreign ministers of
the Gulf Co-operation Council countries.
Mr Hurd said that he and Mr Christopher had been invited to join the foreign
ministers of the Gulf states 'to show our determination to protect the
security of the Gulf'.
He told delegates: 'We have to show Saddam Hussein that we are not going to
be intimidated or divided.
'I will reassure our servicemen and our friends of the support and
resolution of this government and this conference.'
Mr Hurd said that the headquarters staff and leading company of Britain's
'spearhead' battalion of 800 troops would leave for the Gulf immediately
because the situation remained 'confused'. He added: 'Our navy is offshore
and we are doubling the number of Tornados patrolling the skies. We have to
work further with our friends and allies to promote security and peace
throughout the Middle East.'
'I am sorry and sad to miss the rest of this conference but I am sure I
should be there,' he added to loud applause.
Mr Hurd said that intelligence reports on the intentions of Saddam Hussein
had not been clear. 'Obviously there has been a threat. There might be other
threats. There is still a good deal of anxiety and that's why I think it's
notable that the six Gulf foreign ministers have suggested that friends from
outside should join them at their meeting tomorrow and I welcome that.'
Mr Hurd said that Saddam was 'certainly playing a very dangerous game. We
can't be sure what his next moves are. He says one thing, but he doesn't
always do what he says.'
The west had underestimated Saddam's 'boldness' in the Gulf war, he told BBC
Radio 4. 'If he has been deterred this time, if he is drawing back, it is
because President Clinton, Britain, France and others have been immediate
and robust in saying he won't get away with it.'
Mr Hurd dismissed speculation that the Western powers were considering a
pre-emptive strike against Iraq. 'It is not being seriously considered at
the moment. Our aim is defensive,' he said.
Downing Street added last night that British deployments to the Gulf would
go ahead because there was 'no concrete evidence' of Iraqi withdrawal.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Developers submit case for Scots 'superquarry'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Redland Aggregates, part of the Redland construction group, yesterday opened
its case at the public inquiry into its plan to establish a quarry at
Lingerabay, on Harris in the Western Isles, and extract 600m tonnes of
anorthosite in the next 60 to 100 years.
The inquiry's first witness was Mr John Leivers, director of lands and
planning for Redlands in the UK, who said four previous planning
applications for development at Lingerabay had been granted.
The project involves removing the eastern side of a hill named Roineabhal
and shipping it away, creating an artificial sea loch. The quarry will cover
an area of more than 1 square mile.
Mr Leivers said there would initially be low-key development leading to
increased production to satisfy anticipated demands.
Answering concerns about the effect of the 'superquarry' on tourism, he
said: 'Since coming to Harris in 1987 I have never met anyone walking off
the hill at Roineabhal except sheep.'
The Scottish National Party made a submission to the inquiry when it opened
which urged exhaustive research into the effects of the plan and called for
a referendum of the people of Harris to be held before the application was
decided by Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary.
The superquarry has the support of Western Isles council, but the Scottish
secretary ordered the inquiry because of the environmental and economic
issues.
Objectors say it would harm the island's economy, creating noise, dust,
vibration and traffic to the detriment of the tourist industry. The hearing
is likely to last into next year.

FT  12 OCT 94 / BR admits to job cuts at offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions expect to be told next week that more than 1,500 white-collar workers
will lose their jobs at British Rail Infrastructure Services over the next
six months as the organisation is split into 20 separate companies prior to
privatisation.
British Rail yesterday admitted there would be job losses but refused to
confirm the figure of 1,500. Unions believe the main victims will be
managerial and administrative staff.
BRIS, which employs 30,000, is subcontracted by Railtrack to maintain track
and signalling work.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Labour poll boost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The popularity of Tony Blair's Labour party has risen still further
following his conference triumph, giving his party a 17 point lead over the
Tories, according to a poll in today's Guardian.
In the monthly ICM poll 49 per cent said they would support Labour, 32 per
cent Conservative and 15 per cent the Liberal Democrats. October's survey
results match those for Labour in August, shortly after Mr Blair was elected
party leader. In July they registered 44 per cent and 45 per cent in
September.

In a speech to the conference, Mr David Curry, minister for local

'There is no monolithic plan, no covert agenda, no hidden blueprint to

He told a fringe meeting that the Nimby (not in my backyard) attitudes of

from an antagonistic view of growth and a misunderstanding of the nature of

Mr David Hunt, minister responsible for the Citizen's Charter, claimed that
a dynamic market economy could flourish only with the Conservatives in
office, Ivor Owen writes.
He said this had to be clearly demonstrated, and individuals and families
reassured that they could feel secure under the present government.
Mr Hunt admitted the dangers of a Labour government were 'real enough', but
insisted the Tory party's current poor showing in the opinion polls could be
remedied.
He said: 'Opinion polls have taken us to the edge of the abyss before, but
the people never have.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hanley forecasts recovery
in government fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jeremy Hanley yesterday predicted a sustained revival in the government's
fortunes as he shrugged off his accident-prone image in a confident opening
performance as party chairman at the Bournemouth conference.
Setting the official tone for the four days of debates, Mr Hanley presented
the Conservatives as the party of realism and achievement - and Labour and
the Liberal Democrats as the parties of cheap rhetoric.
He also signalled the start of a co-ordinated strategy to rebuild Mr Major's
public image as a quiet but effective and gritty prime minister.
Hailing Mr Major as the architect of what may prove to be an historic peace
in Northern Ireland, Mr Hanley told the conference that Britain was led by
'the right man in the right place at the right time'.
His comments came as colleagues said that, in spite of the expected squalls
at the conference over Northern Ireland and Europe, Mr Major was convinced
that his government was at the start of sustained revival.
Mr Hanley condemned Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, as a man without
memory or conscience: 'He may dream of a new socialism, but his party
remains a nightmare of old socialism.'
He predicted a fifth victory for the Conservatives in the election due by
mid-1997.
He added that it would be 'a victory not through deals and pacts with other
parties, not by casting aside our long-held principles and values because of
a lust for power, but by our determination and our dedication and on the
realities of our achievements.'
Insisting that the government was listening to the concerns of the
electorate, Mr Hanley said that the economic recovery would bring
'confidence, jobs and prosperity'.
He sought to forestall a threatened grassroots rebellion in Thursday's
debate on crime by pledging that the government would continue to take
tougher action to protect law-abiding citizens: 'We are the only party of
law and order and we will never stop being the party of law and order.'
Mr Hanley also picked up the theme of Mr Major's opening remarks at the
conference on Monday evening by accusing Labour of planning a 'massive
transfer of power and sovereignty to Brussels'.
The warm applause for the new chairman lifted some of the shadow over Mr
Hanley after his recent succession of gaffes.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hints of cut in M-way
spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, yesterday called for a new
debate on the future of roadbuilding in Britain amid signs that the
government is preparing to curtail spending on trunk roads and motorways.
In his first speech as a minister to a Conservative party conference, Dr
Mawhinney gave a clear indication that he is reassessing the annual Pounds
2bn road-building programme he inherited from his predecessor, Mr John
MacGregor.
He spelled out his commitment to 'manage the existing road work in the most
effective manner', and to minimise new trunk-road building through open
countryside and cities.
He also announced a range of measures to combat car pollution including the
introduction of tougher emission standards for diesel vehicle emission and
random spot checks on polluting vehicles in major cities.
'People are worried about the effect road schemes have on the landscape,
historic sites, woodlands and on wildlife,' he told the conference. 'Part of
our response is to carry out environmental assessments of all road schemes.'
Talking to journalists yesterday, the transport secretary said he was
undertaking a reassessment of the future of roadbuilding. 'I have started to
ask a few questions about the programmes I have inherited. We are now going
to enter a debate as we seek to find a balance between the economic, social
and environmental criteria of road building policy.'
On rail policy, Dr Mawhinney gave the first confirmation since the end of
the rail strike that the government would press ahead with the privatisation
of Railtrack.
'Our country needs a modern and efficient railway,' he told delegates. 'As
with every privatisation, this will improve efficiency, free up investment,
enhance services that the customer wants and expand choice.'
He was warmly applauded by delegates after announcing that driving licences
will carry photographs from July 1996. He said that some 85 per cent of
respondents to a recent consultation exercise had approved the idea.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Hurd warns of dangers in a
lurch to the right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A powerful warning against a lurch to the right by the Conservative party in
domestic policy and a retreat into isolation in foreign affairs was issued
yesterday by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
As the conference continued to debate the party's response to the electoral
threat posed by Mr Tony Blair's modernisation of the Labour party, Mr Hurd
said the Conservatives must not cede the political centre ground.
He accompanied a strong rebuttal of the suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, the
former chancellor, that Britain should consider withdrawal from the European
Union with an equally firm insistence that the Conservatives must not lose
touch with 'common-sense convictions'.
Mr Hurd said the 'poison' in Tory divisions over Europe had 'ebbed out of it
a good deal', especially in the light of the more Eurosceptic stance adopted
by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in this year's Euro-elections.
Heading a move by a series of centre-left ministers to apply the brakes to a
drift to the right in the party's rhetoric, he said it must demonstrate that
it has a vision of society which stretches beyond the free market.
Mr Hurd told the Tory Reform Group: 'Conservatives need to show that our
vision of society is broader and richer than capitalism. The market can only
deliver its promise within a social amd political context.'
He accused Mr Blair of attempting to 'clamber onto our platform, paint it a
different colour and claim it as his own'. But just because Labour was
trying to capture the fundamental Tory concepts of citizenship and
community, the Conservatives should not respond by abandoning them.
Instead the government should show it had an agenda for change which 'goes
with the grain of what people want'.
In his speech on the conference floor, Mr Hurd said that the government must
craft a foreign policy based 'not on the world as it was, not on the world
as we would like it to be, but as it is'.
That meant recognition that wielding influence on the world stage depended
on Britain playing its part in the big international institutions - the UN,
Nato and the Commonwealth - and playing an active role in the European
Union.
In a brusque rejection of the xenophobia of some on the right of the Tory
party, Mr Hurd dismissed the 'siren sounds' of those who believed Britain
could turn its back on Europe.
He told the conference: 'We can enjoy ourselves morning, noon and night,
poking fun at foreigners . . . But if we indulge ourselves in that sort of
way we won't have a strong and effective foreign policy; we won't be
influencing events; we won't be advancing British interests.'
Lord Plumb, chairman of the Conservative members of the European Parliament,
referring to the Eurosceptics, said: 'We don't need hindrance and knocking
when we are trying to get on with the job in the European Parliament,'
Roland Rudd writes.
Mr Tom Spencer, chairman of the Conservative group in the parliament,
described Mr Norman Lamont's intervention attacking the European Union as 'a
new touch of bitterness'.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Health officials resist
pressure from Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Health is coming under strong Treasury pressure to reduce
capital spending on hospitals and community health projects in spite of
drastic cuts in the amount allocated for these schemes in recent years.
Amid signs that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is preparing big cuts in
public expenditure in the Budget, the Treasury has told Department of Health
officials to fund more capital spending on the National Health Service with
private-sector money.
In recent years the Department of Health has had considerable success
obtaining capital investment under the government's private-finance
initiative for the provision of dialysis centres, food and laundry services.
This has led to a cut in state spending on NHS capital expenditure from
Pounds 1.093bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 600m in this financial year. As
negotiations over this year's spending round come to a close, Department of
Health officials are resisting a further cut.
They have told the Treasury that the department has already made efficiency
savings through proposals to abolish regional health authorities and by
keeping pay increases very low.
'We are in favour of private finance,' said a Department of Health official
yesterday. 'But we are also telling the Treasury that there are hospitals
with leaky roofs and poor facilities which need increased spending by
Whitehall.'
The pressure on health service spending comes amid signs that Tory activists
are increasingly concerned about the impact of some of the reforms to the
NHS.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday ran into tough
criticism from constituency representatives attending a fringe meeting.
In previous years Tory activists have listened respectfully to Mrs
Bottomley's comments at fringe meetings. But this year they issued a range
of complaints about management expenditure in the NHS, the closure of an
accident-and-emergency department and a cut in medical services for the
elderly.
Ms Uma Fernandez, a community nurse from Brent in north-west London, told
Mrs Bottomley that too many nursing jobs were now being done by people who
were not qualified. She said: 'We feel threatened by some of these changes.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Mark Thatcher revelations
seen as 'plot'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Allegations of impropriety appeared to be taking a toll on the government
yesterday, as a senior backbench MP blamed disclosures about Mr Mark
Thatcher's role in arms sales on a plot against the Conservatives.
Baroness Thatcher, who arrived at the conference yesterday morning, refused
to comment on claims that her son received a commission for helping to set
up the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia.
But Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbench
MPs, said the timing of the disclosures on the eve of the party conference
suggested that the intention was 'to undermine the government'.
Sir Marcus, the most senior Conservative backbencher, told BBC Radio: 'I see
in all this a plot.' He asked: 'Is it just coincidence that as soon as we
arrive for our party conference . . . something breaks?'
Baroness Thatcher, who was given a warm but muted welcome by conference
delegates, was lavishly praised by Mr Jeremy Hanley, party chairman, after
emerging from 40 minutes of talks with Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Smiling grimly, Lady Thatcher waved for the cameras, but refused to answer
journalists' questions. Later, guests at a private lunch said she appeared
frail, but adroitly sidestepped questions on the Al Yamamah affair. Lady
Thatcher later left for a visit to the US.
Party managers sought to play down the allegations, but Mr William
Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, admitted they were hurting the party
even though they were inaccurate. 'I know there is this miasma around. I
believe it is unfair in that it is not based on real fact and I believe that
the party must shake itself free of all that,' he said.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, who left for a visit to the Gulf
Co-operation Council in Kuwait last night, said the controversy was unlikely
to be raised by Arab ministers.
Mr David Hunt, the public service minister, also sought to play down the
affair. He said the government would not be deflected from the main purpose
of the conference.
Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, said that he had no recollection of
Mr Mark Thatcher's name being mentioned in the context of the Al Yamamah
deal.
'There was no question of any impropriety being suggested in relation to
Mark Thatcher or anybody else,' he said on BBC Radio.
Mr Alan Clark, a former trade and defence minister, said he was 'quite
certain' that Lady Thatcher would never have allowed her son 'to talk to her
about a deal or to influence the way it was structured'.
Labour continued to issue allegations against Mr Thatcher. Mr Tam Dalyell,
MP for Linlithgow, wrote to Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, asking whether Mr
Thatcher and a Saudi middleman had paid tax on commissions earned from the
arms deal.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Farm tenancies to be
revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to legislate to revive the market in farm tenancies and
provide more opportunities for the start of new farming enterprises.
Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said a bill would be launched
early in the parliamentary session which opens next month freeing new
tenancies from the succession obligations imposed by the last Labour
government.
Mr Waldegrave described the 1976 legislation, which gave new rights to the
children of tenants, as arguably the most damaging measure this century to
young farmers and new entrants to farming.
Mr Waldegrave said the new legislation would permit farmers and landowners
to 'make agreements to suit each other'. The government had acted in
response to representations by the National Farmers' Union, the Country
Landowners' Association, the Tenant Farmers' Association and young farmers.
He said 'both sides' agreed that the new legislation would result in more
tenant farms becoming available, attract 'new blood' and offer a chance of
reversing the decline in the tenanted family farm.
Responding to attacks by a succession of constituency representatives on the
scale of fraud and corruption in the Common Agricultural Policy, he promised
that Britain would make reform 'central' to future developments in the
European Union.

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Lamont says it may be
necessary to pull out of EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain should consider leaving the European Union if it cannot halt the
process of European political integration, Mr Norman Lamont, the former
chancellor, said yesterday as Europe dominated the first day of the Tory
conference.
In a hard-hitting speech to an audience of rightwingers on the conference
fringe, Mr Lamont said it was 'simplistic' to say that the option of leaving
the EU was 'unthinkable'.
But he stressed he was not suggesting that Britain should 'today
unilaterally withdraw from Europe'. In an interview, he said he would
advocate withdrawing 'if we cannot get the sort of political deal I think we
deserve and ought to stand for'.
But Lord Tebbit, former Conservative chairman, shouted down rightwing
hecklers' demands to withdraw from Europe at a separate fringe meeting,
saying: 'There's no need to get out. We have the weight to make a difference
if we have the will.'
Lord Tebbit said he had little doubt that Britain could deal 'a fatal blow'
to those seeking to create a European superstate if it made plain it would
veto plans for a political union with the continental powers.
He said enlargement of the EU would require a 'massive change' from the
'centralised Europe of Maastricht' to 'a Gaullist Europe of nation-states,
some of whom may wish to integrate, others of whom may wish to
disintegrate'.
'Those states should be bound by treaty to do at supranational level only
that which is necessary to ensure the free movement of goods, services and
capital.'
Mr William Cash, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Stafford, urged the government
to 'force the issue' of a single European currency by saying ''No' now' to
any such step.
Mr Lamont, describing the outcome of the Maastricht negotiations as 'a sort
of Band-aid to our problems', said one possible course of action would be
for Britain to say at the intergovernmental conference in 1996 that 'we do
not want to participate in any further political development in Europe'.
The IGC would force Britain to make 'a fundamental choice' over whether to
subscribe to a Europe with a 'federal character,' he said.
'Being part of a federal Europe is not what the British people or the
Conservative party want . . . Britain is on a collision course with its
partners unless we can find a means of resolving the different aspirations.'
He could not, he said, pinpoint 'a single concrete economic advantage that
unambiguously comes to this country because of our membership of the
European Union.'
Mr Lamont added: 'It is a tremendous opportunity now that Tony Blair has
committed himself uncritically to a single European currency, to a more
centralised Europe.
'I believe we should exploit this and home in on a much more distinctive
Conservative European policies.'

FT  12 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Powell predicts slide
towards united Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Devolution for Ulster could act as a stepping-stone to a united Ireland, Mr
Enoch Powell, the former Tory cabinet minister, warned yesterday.
As supporters of full integration of the province into the UK stepped up
their campaign urging ministers to embrace their viewpoint, the octogenarian
Mr Powell used a rare appearance on the conference fringe to condemn the
government's Northern Ireland policy.
The government had simply come up with a new version of the game-plan that
had been in place for decades: 'Give Northern Ireland a new identity and we
will soon get it out of the United Kingdom,' he said.
The object of the conference, involving Ulster's main constitutional
parties, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, hoped to convene was 'to
recommend a measure of self government for Northern Ireland which will . . .
enable it to be associated with the Irish Republic even more directly than
it was by the Anglo-Irish agreement'.
His assertion came as Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, told the party
that the government's position was founded on 'an impregnable rock of
principle' - that Northern Ireland's future depended on the wishes of its
people.
Britain and Britain alone was responsible for the government of 'this part
of our country', Mr Hurd stressed. Aides said Mr Hurd's comments were
directed at Washington rather than Dublin.
Addressing a sympathetic audience of rightwingers, Mr Powell - the Ulster
Unionist MP for South Down for 13 years until 1987 - attacked Washington's
role in current efforts to forge a durable political settlement in the
province.
'The US has ordained that the UK government is to use its best efforts to
satisfy the IRA and the territorial ambitions of the Irish Republic,' he
said. He predicted that the IRA would resume violence if it decided it would
not achieve its objectives peacefully.
Questioned by Mr Peter Bottomley, a former Northern Ireland minister, on
whether he would urge people to vote against proposals incorporating 'some
element of devolution' if they were backed by three of the four main
political parties in Ulster, Mr Powell replied simply: 'Yes.'
The role of the US was also attacked by Lord Tebbit, another former cabinet
minister, who said President Bill Clinton thought he could 'push us around
even in Northern Ireland as though this was a Caribbean banana republic'.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Gummer to brush aside 'Nimbys'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Gummer, environ-ment secretary, yesterday promised to sweep aside
unreasonable objections to new roads and housing and other developments
needed to strengthen the economy, Ivor Owen writes.
He told a fringe meeting the Nimby (not in my backyard) attitudes of those
who oppose any development in their area whatever its merits derived from an
antagonistic view of growth and a misunderstanding of the nature of
conservation.
'Nimbyism describes an obsession with the bric-a-brac of the past and the
substitution of preservation for conservation.' Mr Gummer said this approach
would be rejected whenever it appeared, whether houses, businesses or roads
were the target.
He sympathised with those miscast as Nimbys when they had legitimate
objections to inappropriate development. They were rightly concerned about
intrusive buildings which made no pretence of being an integral part of a
town or village, or when they saw the same designs and materials used in
towns with widely differing characteristics.

FT  12 OCT 94 / Violence increases in Guatemala
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Violence and human right abuses in Guatemala have increased greatly in
recent months, despite the imminent arrival of a UN human rights monitoring
mission, observers say.
Fighting has been intensified between government forces and left-wing
guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, who are due to
restart stalled peace talks this month.
Mr Ronald Ochaeta, director of the Catholic Church's local human rights
office, says there were 180 killings in August, at least 35 of them
politically motivated, making it the worst month since the office opened
five years ago.
The UN mission is expected to begin operating early next month, more than
seven months after the two sides signed an agreement calling for the
immediate installation of such a mission.
The UN, which is mediating at the talks, had promised a mission in three
months, but has dragged its feet, citing bureaucratic problems in approving
finance. Diplomats say that UN officials have been reluctant to commit
themselves to a mission while there was still armed conflict, despite making
promises at the negotiating table. 'We have to question the UN seriously,'
said Mr Ochaeta. 'To a certain extent, the UN is responsible for what is
happening at the moment.'
The guerrillas announced in early August that they were suspending talks
because the government had failed to comply with the human rights accord
signed at the end of March. In that, the government agreed that the army
would stop pressing indigenous youths into its ranks, cease threats against
popular leaders and human rights activists, and try to reduce the levels of
violence.
But local human rights monitors say they have many complaints of forced
recruitment in recent months, while threats and violence have continued
unabated. The guerrillas have also violated the agreement, recruiting
under-age people and attacking civilian installations.
The guerrillas were pushed by the international community into signing an
agreement in Oslo in June on setting up a commission to investigate war
crimes during the 33-year conflict. The commission's mandate falls short of
naming individuals who have committed atrocities, and will have no legal
recourse.

FT  12 OCT 94 / US launches probe into car pricing policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Justice has launched an inquiry into pricing practices
in the car industry.
Government anti-trust lawyers have asked the National Automobile Dealers'
Association and several of its officers for information on the practice of
no-haggle pricing.
Following the successful example of GM's Saturn subsidiary, many dealers
have started to publish firm prices instead of following the traditional
practice of publishing an unrealistically high label price, and negotiating
discounts.
Some have also adopted the practice of 'value-pricing', in which they sell
some popular models with a package of normally optional extras at a single
low recommended price.
But the Justice Department request for information spreads beyond pricing,
and could herald a broad investigation of dealership arrangements in the
industry.
None of the big carmakers has yet been contacted by the Justice Department,
but all were asked to provide information earlier this summer for an
investigation into their relationships with car hire companies. That
investigation appeared to focus on whether carmakers had cut back sales of
heavily discounted vehicles to independent hire companies.
Ford owns Hertz and an interest in Budget, while Chrysler owns the Dollar
and Thrifty companies. GM is in the process of selling its stake in National
Car Rental.
The US industry experienced years of relatively lax anti-trust enforcement
in the Reagan and Bush administrations, which limited their challenges, for
the most part, to cartel behaviour and horizontal mergers between
competitors. However, the Clinton administration has shown more interest in
vertical arrangements - either mergers between supplier and customer or
contractual arrangements such as minimum resale price agreements which could
raise prices for the consumers.
Both Ms Anne Bingaman, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general
in charge of anti-trust, and Mr Robert Pitofsky, recently nominated to head
the Federal Trade Commission, have expressed interest in reviving the
enforcement of anti-trust laws against vertical arrangements.
