Three police officers have been taken hostage by farmers protesting at the
creation of a tribal reservation near their land in northern Brazil, Globo
television reported yesterday.
An estimated 10,000 farmers poured into the small town of Montesalves, in
Maranhao state, and are demanding the land earmarked for the indigenous
people. As well as holding the officers, the protestors set fire to a bridge
on a road to the site.

The Indian government yesterday rejected a parliamentary committee's demands
for further punitive action against those allegedly involved in the 1992
Rs40bn (Pounds 816m) Bombay securities market scandal.
In a report presented to parliament, the government sought to end argument
over the scandal by spelling out the punishments already imposed on
individuals and institutions and the regulatory changes made to improve
operation of the securities market. The government was responding to an
all-party parliamentary report presented last December demanding tough
action.
But the opposition parties, which have sensed the ruling Congress (I) party
is vulnerable to accusations of corruption and financial incompetence,
yesterday pledged to keep up the attack.
The opposition parties want the resignations of the health minister, Mr B.
Shankaranand, who was oil minister during the scandal, and of Mr Romeshwar
Thakur, rural development minister, who was a junior finance minister in
1992. In an all-party parliamentary report into the scandal presented last
year, Mr Shankaranand was accused of having authorised various money
transfers when, as oil minister, he headed the state-owned Oil Industry
Development Board. Mr Thakur was accused of having delayed investigations.
Demands for their resignations have become entwined with calls for the
resignation of Mr Kalpnath Rai, food minister, blamed in a government report
for the mishandling of a sugar shortage this year.
The demands have left Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao in an awkward position
because he wants to clean the party's image following recent state elections
in which it fared badly, partly because of voters' anger at alleged
corruption. Mr Rao has not dismissed the ministers for fear of splitting the
party leadership. Congress MPs believe he still hopes to organise a Cabinet
reshuffle to camouflage any sackings.
In yesterday's report, the government detailed measures taken to improve
banking supervision, including the setting-up of a Board of Financial
Supervision within the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, and rules to
improve transparency in stock market trading. It listed officials and bank
executives dismissed or moved because of the scandal and said criminal cases
had been lodged against 96 individuals.
In rejecting the parliamentary committee's demands for cancellation or
suspension of licences for foreign banks alleged to have been involved in
the scandal, substantial punishment, including financial penalties, were
said to have been imposed already.

FT  21 DEC 94 / N Korea holds on to crash pilot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON, Seoul Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday refused to release a captured US army pilot until it
has completed an investigation into the crash of his helicopter over its
territory on Saturday.
Pyongyang is expected to repatriate the pilot if it is satisfied that the
incident was caused by a navigational error, as claimed by the US. This was
made clear by a North Korean diplomat in a statement to the South Korean
news agency Yonhap.
Washington had indicated that if North Korea refused to release the pilot
and the body of his co-pilot, who was killed in the helicopter crash, such
intransigence could jeopardise the recent nuclear agreement reached with the
US.
North Korea has so far refrained from exploiting the incident for propaganda
purposes.
But Pyongyang has now held the pilot longer than it kept US service
personnel when it shot down a US helicopter in 1977.
The bodies of the three servicemen who were killed in that incident, along
with the one survivor, were returned within three days.
Meanwhile, the US military has imposed fresh restrictions on helicopter
flights along the demilitarised zone which separates the two Koreas, to
prevent similar incidents occurring.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Japan's top industrial policy official to quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The most senior bureaucrat in Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry is to resign, government officials announced last night.
Mr Hideaki Kumano, who as Miti vice-minister is Japan's top industrial
policy official and one of its top trade negotiators, is to step down after
the end of the year, they said.
No reason was given, but this appears to be the climax of a more than
year-long power struggle between the bureaucracy and Japan's politicians, in
which Mr Kumano is the most senior victim so far.
Since the Liberal Democratic party returned to power six months ago, after a
humiliating year in opposition, it has been seeking to reassert its
authority over the public administration. Mr Kumano's political master, Mr
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Miti minister, also happens to be a rising and reputedly
ruthless star in the LDP.
Miti has been at the centre of this battle, because of the influence it
exercises as controller of more licences and permits (1,769 at the latest
government count) than any other ministry.
Mr Kumano's resignation had been rumoured since the LDP's return in June,
when several ministers in the incoming government called for a purge of
senior bureaucrats who had used the political upheavals of the past year to
boost the public administration's power. The government issued a warning at
that time, rather than risk an open dispute with the bureaucracy.
Mr Kumano is believed to have annoyed the party by failing, during the LDP's
period out of power, to stop the forced resignation of Mr Masahisa Naito, an
LDP sympathiser, as head of Miti's powerful industrial policy bureau.
Mr Naito was ousted last December by former Miti minister Hiroshi Kumagai,
now a member of the opposition New Frontier party and a close ally of Mr
Ichiro Ozawa, NFP strategic mastermind. Mr Naito was alleged to have
promoted a young Miti official, to improve his chances of winning a
parliamentary seat for the LDP.
Early this year, Mr Kumano had to make a public apology for a Miti document
encouraging business organisations to comment favourably on an economic
stimulus package issued by the government of the time. The document,
criticised as an example of covert bureaucratic influence, may have further
linked him to the present opposition in the mind of the LDP's Mr Hashimoto.

South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, his first deputy Mr Thabo Mbeki,
and African National Congress secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa were
yesterday elected unopposed to the ANC's top three offices on the
second-last day of its triennial conference. Delegates affirmed support for
the government, especially in economic policy.
In elections for the party's six top offices, Mr Mandela was re-elected
party president. Mr Mbeki's position as heir-apparent was confirmed when he
became deputy president. Mr Ramaphosa kept his post; his former deputy, Mr
Jacob Zuma, took over from Mr Mbeki as national chairperson. Ms Cheryl
Carolus, ANC policy head, became deputy secretary-general and the Rev.
Arnold Stofile, the party's parliamentary chief whip, was elected
treasurer-general.
The election of Mr Zuma, the party leader in KwaZulu-Natal Province and
highest-ranking Zulu in the mainly Xhosa leadership, and Ms Carolus, who is
a 'Coloured', both by wide margins, marked a victory for Mr Mandela, who was
anxious the party affirm its non-racial and non-sexist credentials by
electing a more broadly representative leadership.
The conference rejected a plan by the president that this process be
artificially extended to the 60 party members due to be elected to the
party's national executive today, by allocating nominations according to
ethnic origin, gender and region. Many delegates acknowledged widespread
grassroots frustration over the slow delivery on the ANC's election
promises, but official reports to the conference by 11 policy commissions
broadly endorsed the government's performance to date. To the surprise of
some senior party members, the government's conservative economic policies
won strong support.
Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, said government officials in
the commission examining the economy were taken aback by the acceptance at
all levels of the need for fiscal discipline and sound economic management.
'I was amazed at the degree of consensus. I had anticipated extensive
debate, but it wasn't nearly as sharp as I expected,' Mr Manuel said.
The principle of privatising unproductive state assets was generally
accepted. The commission resolved that any proceeds from such sales should
be used only for retiring state debt, not current expenditure. The
commission recommended tighter government spending curbs, a campaign to
encourage tax evaders to start paying, and the formation of a permanent ANC
Economic Commission to monitor progress.
Resolutions were adopted urging an investigation into the viability of a
national health insurance scheme, and the introduction of incentive schemes
for foreign investors provided they did not interfere with workers' rights.

FT  21 DEC 94 / 'Output gap' leads to inflation alert: Gillian Tett reports
on OECD findings that could fuel the debate on the timing of interest rate
rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strong growth in the US has now eroded all of the spare capacity in the
US economy, suggesting that inflationary pressures may soon intensify, the
OECD outlook said yesterday.
Germany also has a relatively low level of spare capacity in its economy,
even though recovery has started only recently there. However, the UK has
more spare capacity than any other of the six largest industrialised
economy, closely followed by France.
These findings are likely to fuel the debate about the timing of interest
rate rises in OECD countries and the significance of the so-called 'output
gap', not least because the OECD yesterday announced reforms in its
calculations of this gap.
In recent years, western governments have attached growing significance to
the concept of an output gap, since it has been assumed that an erosion of
the spare capacity will lead to higher inflation, The output gap is usually
defined as the difference between the actual growth rate in an economy and
its theoretical potential growth rate if all capacity were used.
However, economists and governments have remained sharply divided over the
correct way to measure the output gap. Although the Bank of England, for
example, uses its own calculations of the UK output gap to help determine
the timing of interest rate rises, it refuses to publish figures on this.
In the past, the OECD's own calculations of the output gap have relied on a
mixture of historical statistical analysis, and judgements about broader
trends in the economy, such as changes in labour market flexibility.
However the OECD is now relying on a more complicated modelling technique
that seeks to estimate the total productive capacity in an economy, compared
with its actual growth.
The OECD admits that the concept remains extremely slippery. Nevertheless,
its finding that the US economy has now eroded all of its spare capacity may
add to pressure for a further rise in US interest rates.
'There is widespread agreement that full employment has been reached (in the
US),' the OECD said. It forecasts that inflation in the US will rise to more
than 3 per cent in the next 18 months. Conversely, the surprising conclusion
that the UK now has more spare capacity than most other European countries
not only highlights the depth of the recent UK recession - but may also fuel
complaints from some economists that further rises in UK interest rates are
unnecessary.
France is also estimated to have a relatively large output gap, which again
may indicate the depth of its recent recession.
Meanwhile the output gap in Japan, which is only now emerging from
recession, is predicted to remain little changed over the next two years,
highlighting the fact that inflationary pressures are likely to remain
subdued, creating little need for interest rate rises.
The OECD warned that Italy, in particular, was one country that needed to
address the problem of the budget deficit, although the Italian government
had introduced some reforms.

FT  21 DEC 94 / OECD forecasts brighter times: Paris body voices optimism
but issues warning on need for structural reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The economic outlook for the industrialised world looks brighter now than at
any point in recent years, with strong growth and low inflation expected
over the next two years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development declared yesterday.
However, this recovery could soon sour if governments do not seize the
chance to address longer-term structural problems by introducing some
politically sensitive reforms, warned the Paris-based think-tank.
In an unusually strong appeal, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief OECD economist,
called on governments to introduce more labour market reform, control their
social security budgets and not to succumb to the temptation of tax cuts.
'This (economic growth) is a golden opportunity to address longer-term
problems,' Mr Shigehara said.
He pointed out that the industrialised countries had largely squandered the
opportunities for reform that had emerged in the last economic upturn in the
1980s.
The appeal came as the OECD, which is funded by 25 industrialised nations to
promote economic co-operation, unveiled its latest half-yearly outlook on
the world economy.
In a very upbeat report, the OECD revised its forecasts upwards for economic
growth and predicted that the industrialised world would see growth of 2.8
per cent this year and around 3 per cent in the following two years.
Interest rates would need to rise in most countries in the industrialised
world over the next few years, as economic growth spread across the region,
the OECD said.
However, rates are unlikely to rise as high as they have in previous
economic upturns, and inflation across most of the OECD area is likely to
remain subdued.
In spite of the recent rise in US interest rates, it remained unclear
whether this monetary tightening would be sufficient to prevent inflationary
pressures from souring the recovery there, the OECD said.
The US remains at the forefront of the surge in growth, though expansion
should slow sharply in the next two years.
Canada and the UK are forecast to see the second highest rate of growth of
the seven largest OECD countries next year, with GDP expected to expand by
4.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively. Continental Europe is also expected to
see accelerating rates of growth next year, although the growth rate in
Germany is not expected to rise above 3 per cent until 1996.
Meanwhile, Ireland is expected to see the fastest growth of any OECD
country, with 5 per cent growth forecast this year and next.
Inflation is expected to remain well below the growth rate in most regions.
Excluding Turkey, which has an unusually high inflation rate, average annual
inflation in the OECD countries is expected to be only 2.3 per cent next
year. But in spite of this optimistic outlook, the OECD warns that
accelerating growth means that governments must soon raise interest rates in
most countries.
The most challenging situation currently exists in the US, where strong
growth over the last four years is estimated to have eroded all the spare
capacity.
Although the US government has already raised interest rates, the report
notes that it 'remains unclear' whether this has been sufficient to prevent
the economy from overheating in the coming years and sliding back into
recession.
The OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates in the US will rise to 6.7
per cent by the start of 1996, and 6.9 per cent in 1996.
Although this implies that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy quite
rapidly next year, Mr Shigehara yesterday pointed out that this rise was
still likely to leave rates well below their peaks in previous upturns.
In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the OECD argues that steady recent
growth has created a 'case for continuing with gradual monetary tightening'.
In continental Europe, German interest rates are expected to remain
unchanged in the near future, although the OECD forecasts that short-term
interest rates will rise to 5.6 per cent in 1996.
In Ireland, the Nordic countries and some other European countries interest
rates may also need to be raised soon if conditions deteriorate, the report
says.
The only exception to this upward trend in interest rates is Japan.
Although the OECD predicts that domestic demand will grow faster in Japan
than most other regions in the next year, the 'appropriate time for moving
rates to an upward path appears to be some way off', it says.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Japanese budget to aim for austerity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Japan's finance ministry yesterday signalled a shift from an expansionary to
a neutral fiscal policy in 1995 by proposing the first fall in budget
outlays in 40 years.
The ministry's draft budget, to be submitted to parliament next month, calls
for a 2.9 per cent decline to Y70,891bn (Pounds 454bn) in overall outlays
for the tax year starting next April. The decline is, however, due to a fall
in debt-servicing charges caused by an accounting change.
General spending, a clearer indicator of the government's fiscal stance, is
to rise by 3.1 per cent to Y42,142bn. Economists in Tokyo estimate this to
be a smaller underlying increase than the current year after adjusting for
fiscal pump-priming packages, not included in the initial budget, and
spending carried over from earlier years.
The proposed austerity reflected the government's 'unhealthy' fiscal
position, said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, the finance minister.
Social security payments, representing the largest share of general
spending, are planned to rise by 3.1 per cent to Y13,892bn, reflecting the
growing number of elderly and a small rise in unemployment. Public works are
set to rise by 4 per cent to Y9,240bn, a slight slowdown from the last
budget's 4.4 per cent growth.
Defence spending is to be squeezed hard, up by a mere 0.86 per cent to
Y4,724bn, the lowest rise for 35 years, and a reflection of the ruling
Liberal Democratic party's need to accommodate its Socialist coalition
partners. Japan, the world's largest aid donor, also plans to follow other
industrialised countries' example in curbing the growth in its foreign aid
budget, up by 3.2 per cent to Y1,098bn, the lowest rise ever.
The austerity of this budget is a consequence of the pressure on government
revenues from the income tax cuts agreed earlier this year and the weakness
of the economic recovery. Tax revenues next year are forecast to rise by a
mere Y66bn to Y53,731bn.
In line with its traditional aversion to increasing the government's debts,
the ministry plans to reduce the amount of bonds it plans to issue next year
by Y1,045bn to Y12,598bn, representing 17.7 per cent of government revenues,
down one percentage point from the current 12 months.
Most of the total, Y9,750bn, will be construction bonds, so called because
they are used to fund public works and are acceptable to the ministry on the
grounds that they increase Japan's assets.
The Japanese government has approved plans for telephone rate increases by
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the country's partially privatised
telecommunications operator and the largest company in the world by market
capitalisation, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The increases in monthly basic subscriber fees and directory assistance
charges, which will be implemented next February, are the first in 18 years.
The move comes after strong lobbying by NTT, as increases in public service
charges have been a sensitive issue for a government faced with a slow
economic recovery.
Last March, the company was forced to abandon its original plan to raise its
subscription fees as the government decided to freeze all utilities and
public service charges to preserve consumer confidence.
The rate increase, which will raise basic subscriber fees by 16.4 per cent
and double the charge for directory assistance for subscribers using the
service more than twice a month, follows last week's approval by the
authorities.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Billion dollar patents windfall for Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo, the UK drugs company, could earn several billion dollars in extra
revenues as a result of changes in US patent laws.
The change in patent expiry arises from Gatt provisions which call call for
a harmonisation of patent laws. In the US, this means replacing the patent
protection term of 17 years from the date the patent was granted with a
20-year protection period from the date the patent was filed.
The change in the rules appears to add 18 months to a US patent protecting
Glaxo's ulcer treatment Zantac, the world's best selling drug. Zantac has
annual sales in the US of about Dollars 2bn and several companies, most
notably Switzerland's Ciba, have been preparing to launch rivals when the
patent expires in December 1995. Zantac's patent was granted 18 months after
filing.
Several drugs companies with products facing US patent expiry over the next
few years might also benefit. Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US might be able
to extend the patent protection on its top drug Capoten by an extra six
months, potentially worth almost Dollars 1bn in revenues.
The rule change implies that any product for which a patent was granted less
than three years after filing should have its patent protection extended,
said Mr Robin Nott, an intellectual property consultant with international
law firm Baker and McKenzie. He said that the law takes effect from June
1995 and applies retrospectively. 'It could even appear that a patent
expires and then revives,' he said.
If more than three years passed between patent filing and granting, the
expiry patent protection would remain unchanged, he said.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it was still studying the impact of the rule
change on all its products. Its best-seller Capoten, a heart drug, loses its
patent protection in August 1995. But the company confirmed that patent
granting took place two and a half years after filing, implying that patent
protection could be extended by another six months.
UK drug company, Wellcome, said that its best seller, anti-viral Retrovir,
whose US patent expires in 1997, would not be affected because more than
three years passed between patent filing and granting.
Manufacturers that had planned to launch rival products once a patent had
expired would be able to continue with the planned launched of their
products, according to the new rules. However, the patent holder might be
able to claim appropriate compensation payments.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Australian brush-off for cheap Russian
wool sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wool International, the Australian wool sales organisation, said yesterday
it was unperturbed by the recent surge in wool sales by Russia, notably to
China. However, the organisation said some large European textile companies,
such as Benetton of Italy, had acquired supplies from Russia, and expressed
hope that 'they don't make a habit of this'.
The organisation, whose primary function has been to handle the sale of
Australia's large wool stockpile, said it became aware of more Russian wool
being used in China last September, when a large Australian trade delegation
went to talk to Chinese buyers.
Wool International said some Chinese customers claimed the Russian wool was
available at about one third the price of Australian supplies. However, WI
maintains the Russian wool is fairly low quality, greasy wool, and requires
additional processing. It also believes that the surge in supplies will be
short-lived.
WI's relaxed stance was backed up by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture
and Resource Economics, the government-owned forecasting agency, yesterday.
In its quarterly commodities report, ABARE said the sharp rise in wool
prices this year and the purchase of lower-quality Russian wool by China in
the September quarter were likely to have contributed to reduced activity by
the Chinese at Australian auctions.
'Access to Russian wool is expected to be short-lived ..with Russian stocks
estimated to have fallen to around 10,000-15,000 tonnes. This and the
current low level of stocks in China are expected to encourage Chinese wool
buyers for the remainder of the season,' it said.
Australian sheep account for about 30 per cent of the world's wool
production, and the commodity represents one of the country's largest export
categories. Woolgrowers faced unfavourable conditions in the early 1990s,
but the recent surge in wool prices has surpassed expectations. Although
prices have been volatile in the most recent quarter, ABARE forecast
yesterday that the eastern wool market indicator should average 790 cents/kg
clean in 1994-5, compared with 547c/kg in the previous 12 months.
One reason for the lack of serious concern about the Russian wool supplies
is that Australia's wool clip is about eight times the size of Russia's.
The ABARE report said Australian rural exports would fall by 10.4 per cent
in 1994-5, as a result of the severe east coast drought which badly hit
winter crop production. The agency said yesterday the fall in volume would
be only partly offset in value terms by higher prices for some rural
commodities, notably wool. The bureau predicted the value of rural exports
would dip by around 5.5 per cent, to ADollars 18bn (USDollars 13.9bn) for
the 1994-5 financial year.
This is the first fall in value terms for four years. Wheat exports are
likely to halve in value and beef exports could be down by 11 per cent.
Sugar exports, however, are predicted to rise strongly while wool exports
could be up by one-fifth.
On the minerals front, the bureau is looking for a 2 per cent rise overall,
to ADollars 30.4bn. This would leave the total value of Australian commodity
exports, which make up the lion's share of total exports, at around ADollars
48.4bn for the year, compared with ADollars 48.8bn in 1993-4.

<TEXT>
Greece has signed a revised agreement with Gazprom, the Russian state gas
supplier, to import natural gas from 1996 through a pipeline from Bulgaria.
The new accord also provides for Prometheus, a joint venture between Gazprom
of Russia and Greece's Kopelouzos group, to build a 400MW coal-fired power
station in northern Greece as a turnkey project for DEH, Greece's state
power company, and supply equipment for two hydro-electric plants under
construction in central Greece. Under the previous agreement, Prometheus was
to build a 250MW gas-fired power station in north-eastern Greece on a
build-own-operate basis. However, the socialist government has abandoned
plans for private power generation in Greece.
Gazprom is to supply at least 500m cubic metres of gas yearly through a
550km pipeline from the Bulgarian border to Athens. The pipeline, financed
mainly by the European Union will be completed early next year at a cost of
Dollars 1.4bn. But construction of gas distribution networks to serve Athens
and four other Greek cities has been delayed by administrative and financial
problems.

<TEXT>
Israel has made big strides in liberalising its trade regime over the past
decade but needs to do much more to stimulate competition and improve the
flexibility of its economy, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. A Gatt secretariat report says the peace and economic agreements
with the Palestine Liberation Organisation should help stimulate trade,
investment and tourism. However, the main economic gains for Israel will
come indirectly from a relaxation and eventual end to the Arab boycott and
reduced political risks of investment. Israel's trade ministry, said there
had been a partial lifting of the secondary and tertiary boycott but no
moves to lift the direct boycott. The Arab boycott may have cost Israel as
much as Dollars 40bn in lost trade and investment. Though trade with third
countries is expanding Israel still does most of its trade on preferential
terms with the US and the EU.

entry
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday conceded defeat in its bid for early membership of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and Gatt's successor, the World Trade
Organisation. China said it was prepared to continue negotiations next year.
In an angry statement yesterday to the Gatt working party on China's
membership terms, Mr Gu Yongjiang, the deputy trade minister, repeated
accusations that the negotiations were being blocked by the 'excessive
demands' of a few Gatt members, a reference to the US and the European Union
in particular.
Mr Gu did not maintain previous threats by Beijing to withdraw trade
concessions already offered and even to restrict western exports if
'substantive agreement' on entry terms was not reached by the end of the
year.
He said China's offers to open markets for foreign goods and services and on
implementation of fair trade rules would remain on the table. However, they
would not be improved. 'The current concessions represent the maximum
efforts China can make at its economic development levels as a developing
country,' Mr Gu argued.
China would not 'initiate' further membership negotiations but it would take
part in the next working party meeting scheduled for February. 'China has no
intention to close the door of negotiation,' Mr Gu said.
Beijing has attached great importance to joining the WTO, which begins work
on January 1, as a founder member. An original member of Gatt in 1948, China
left the organisation in 1950 after the communists came to power. Both the
US and the EU have offered to grant China founder-member status provided the
negotiations are concluded speedily next year.
Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss chairman of the Gatt working party, said
yesterday with an eye to Chinese sensitivities that all the members wanted
to reach a 'balanced substantive agreement' as soon as possible and that
'very substantive progress' had been made in the past few days.
However, trade diplomats said after the working party meeting that many
difficult issues had still to be resolved and that China's market-opening
offers remained unsatisfactory.
Though Beijing continues to castigate Washington as the principal obstacle
to speedy Gatt entry, it is clear that US concerns about Chinese membership
terms are widely shared by developing as well as industrialised countries.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, is to be asked to stay on as
head of the WTO until March 15, to allow more time for his successor to be
chosen. Trade diplomats said a formal decision by Gatt members to that
effect would be taken today.
The EU, whose candidate, Mr Renato Ruggiero, has a commanding lead in the
three-way contest, had wanted a shorter extension for Mr Sutherland, who
earlier this year announced his intention to leave at the end of December.
But the US, which is backing Mr Carlos Salinas, the former Mexican
president, wanted longer to allow Mr Salinas time to campaign after leaving
office this month.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Row as Mercedes picks France - German
carmaker to build Swatchmobile in low-wage, flexible Lorraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Mercedes-Benz and Swiss watch group SMH are to go ahead with plans
to build a DM750m (Dollars 503m) car factory in France despite political and
trade union protests.
Construction will start next autumn, and production of the micro-compact
two-seater model - dubbed the Swatchmobile - will start in late 1997 in
preparation for a pan-European launch in early 1998, Mercedes said
yesterday.
The city runabout, priced at 'well under DM20,000', will be marketed by
about 90 main Mercedes dealers and in department stores, the Daimler-Benz
subsidiary said.
As revealed by angry German trade union leaders last week, the assembly
plant is to be built in Hambach, around 5km from the town of Sarreguemines
on the French-German border. The factory will be able to make up to 200,000
cars a year, and employ up to 1,900.
The decision was confirmed yesterday by the Daimler-Benz board following a
fevered debate over Daimler's alleged neglect of its responsibility to build
the ground-breaking new model in Germany.
The argument effectively ended on Monday night after Mr Edzard Reuter, group
chairman, and Mr Nicholas Hayek, head of SMH, explained the rationale for
the decision to assemble in France to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Mr Reuter had earlier been pressed to reconsider by Mr Erwin Teufel, prime
minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, Daimler's home state. He had also received a
protest letter from Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union, the senior party in the ruling Bonn coalition
which is governing with a majority of only 10.
According to Daimler, MCC, the joint-venture company set up to run the
project, in which the German group has a 51 per cent stake, had examined
more than 70 possible sites. Hambach was selected because it was located in
the centre of the main market for the Swatchmobile, and because of its
competitive wage costs and highly flexible working times and conditions.
Other considerations included ideal road and rail links: Hambach is close to
the A4 trunk road from Paris to Strasbourg which joins the German autobahn
network in Saarbrucken.
However, the decisive factors were most likely to have been payroll bills -
unit labour costs in France are about 40 per cent lower than in Germany,
according to the VDA automotive industry association - and more co-operative
unions.
Although details have not yet been published, the lean assembly procedures
for the Swatchmobile are expected to demand maximum flexibility from the
workforce in terms of working times and practices.
The cars will be assembled mainly from complete modules and large components
supplied from outside the Hambach site, where only about 20 per cent of the
necessary parts are to be made. As a result of the demand for bought-in
modules, Daimler claims, component suppliers - mostly in Germany - will need
to hire about 7,000 additional workers. 'Strategically important' parts
would be made by Mercedes and SMH.
The president of the Sarreguemines district, Mr Hubert Roth, said he hoped
the Hambach site would become 'a pole of attraction' for the car industry,
noting that Mercedes had taken an option on a further 14 hectares, in
addition to the 50 hectares on which it will build the car plant.
Mr Gerard Longuet, the former French industry minister who still heads the
Lorraine regional council, said the investment fitted with Lorraine's
cross-frontier development strategy. It would create more than 2,000 jobs
directly and another 8,500 indirectly. In Paris, officials said France would
give aid up to the permitted ceiling of 17 per cent of the DM750m
investment, but this would have to be cleared by the European Commission in
Brussels.

<TEXT>
The Bank of France should halve its number of regional branches and be more
efficient in making notes and coins, according to reports by McKinsey and
two other outside consultants commissioned by the French central bank
itself. The bank's board commissioned the studies on its future over the
next six to ten years, in the light of its new independence from the
government over monetary policy and the prospect of itself become a regional

staff, the bank employs more than other central banks because it not only
prints money and runs the payments clearing system but also has 176 regional

The Danish government is to back a complaint to the European Court by Danish
shipbuilders against German government subsidies to four shipyards in the
former East Germany. The Danish shipyards claim the German government and
the EU Commission have exceeded their authority when awarding subsidies to
the shipyards. Bonn was authorised by the EU's seventh shipbuilding
directive to pay re-structuring subsidies of DM6.2bn (Pounds 2.5bn) on
condition that the yards' capacity was reduced. The Danes say the shipyards'
capacity will be substantially increased.

Mr Herve de Charette, France's housing minister, yesterday warned Mr Jacques
Chirac, mayor of Paris and presidential candidate, that his call for
compulsory requisitioning of vacant houses and flats for the capital's
homeless would deter property investment. Instead he proposed to Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur that the government pay special premiums to get
landlords to let vacant properties and to housing associations to help the

Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's government was embarrassed yesterday by the
decision of one of Spain's top investigative magistrates, to imprison a
former senior member of the interior ministry on counts of attempted murder,
kidnapping and misuse of public funds. The development fuelled market
nervousness in Spain where attention is already centred on investigations of
Mr Mario Conde, who was dismissed by the Bank of Spain as chairman of
Banesto a year ago. Mr Conde was questioned for the second consecutive day
yesterday over alleged fraud in connection with the collapse of Banesto.
Judge Baltasar Garzon jailed Mr Julian Sancristobal, director general of
state security between 1984 and 1986, in connection with the activities of a
group called GAL, Anti-terrorist Liberation Group, that claimed 23 fatal
victims in a shooting and bombing campaign against suspected ETA Basque
separatists in south west France 10 years ago. Included in the indictment
are the former head of the anti-terrorist unit in the Basque city of Bilbao,
who was jailed along with Mr Sancristobal, who was arrested yesterday at
Barcelona airport when he was allegedly trying to leave Spain.

<TEXT>
The UK faces being outvoted by its European partners when EU fisheries
ministers reconvene in Brussels tomorrow after two days of talks failed to
agree terms on Spain's full integration into the Union's common fisheries
policy. The UK held out yesterday against limited Spanish access to its
western coastal waters. But Madrid has said it will block enlargement, to
bring Austria, Sweden and Finland into the EU on January 1, unless it gets
satisfaction. Senior German officials said they would put the dispute to a
vote on Thursday rather than risk jeopardising EU expansion, leaving Britain
facing isolation.
The German presidency of the EU has proposed a compromise on the sensitive
'Irish Box' - the waters surrounding the island of Ireland - which would let
40 Spanish trawlers inside. This is roughly the same proportion of vessels
in these waters as fleets from other member states send into the Irish Box,
and therefore, in the EU majority view, treats Spain equally.

<TEXT>
Russian army units yesterday continued to pound Chechen positions to the
north of the capital of Grozny but were meeting what the Russian Interior
Ministry admitted was 'stiff resistance' and are still holding back from an
assault. Despite mounting protests at home and abroad, the government
continues to show a will to squeeze the city, if not yet take it. A meeting
of officials chaired by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin promised further
'decisive action,' saying that the army was preparing to cut minor roads to
the south of the city. A statement released after the meeting spoke of
Chechen forces retreating to the hills, while those which remained used
civilians as 'human shields'. The government press service maintained that
the 'city is in panic'. But these reports are not wholly confirmed by
journalists still in Grozny. Western military analysts in Moscow believe
seizure of the city is being delayed until it is as empty as possible and
until surrounding Chechen forces have been weakened. While talks were still
being called for yesterday, these are now thought all but impossible.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministry said Russia was closing its borders with
Georgia and Azerbaijan to prevent the movement of rebel fighters in
Chechnya.

on prospects for end to fighting

<TEXT>
Bosnia's warring factions have agreed to a four-month ceasefire which will
be worked out in detail over the next 10 days, Mr Jimmy Carter, the former
US president, announced yesterday.
In a day of frenetic diplomacy, Mr Carter met the Bosnian Moslem leadership
in Sarajevo, then drove to the Bosnian Serbs' stronghold of Pale for a
further round of talks with Mr Radovan Karadzic, their leader.
Mr Carter said: 'The most significant achievement this morning was that the
Bosnian Serb leaders ..agreed to a complete ceasefire throughout Bosnia ..to
be implemented on .. December 23'. Talks between then and January 1 are
intended to work out details of the four-month ceasefire which would be
'monitored by UN forces along all lines of confrontation, with a cessation
of all hostile activities'.
Hopes of an end to the fighting remain slim, however, and the two sides have
already expressed reservations about the agreement.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian Moslem president, said: 'I don't see the
chance for peace but I see a chance for a ceasefire.' Mr Karadzic appeared
doubtful whether ceasefire conditions about exchange of prisoners and Moslem
withdrawal from the demilitiarised zone around Sarajevo would be fulfilled.
Mr Carter later continued his private peace mission by flying to Belgrade
for talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
Members of the five-nation Contact Group, comprising the US, Russia,
Germany, France and the UK, are to hold separate talks with Mr Milosevic
today in Belgrade.
Many previous ceasefires have been agreed and violated since war erupted in
Bosnia 32 months ago. A peace plan, put forward by the Contact Group, calls
on Bosnian Serbs to roll back their gains from 70 to 49 per cent of the
country. The Moslem-led Bosnian government insists the Serbs must say they
accept the plan before talks continue. On Monday, the Bosnian Serb
leadership said it agreed to accept the plan 'as a basis for negotiations of
all points.'
Mr Carter's apparent breakthrough came as the UN announced that parts of the
Belgrade-Zagreb motorway would re-open today for the first time since August
1991.
The agreement to open the road, if honoured, could close a loophole in
sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. It is seen as a vital step for Mr
Milosevic in securing extension of the provisional easing of UN sanctions
against Belgrade.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Impact feared on recovery: Institutional government seen as
one way to restore stability and unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Up to now, the brawl on Italy's bridge about who is in command has done
little to upset work in the engine-room, where the real economy has powered
ahead. But industrialists fear this week's no-confidence votes could usher
in a new phase of political uncertainty and turmoil on financial markets.
Among the few well known names to speak out publicly has been Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti and a business rival of Prime Minister
Silvio Berlusconi. He provoked the wrath of the premier last week with an
interview in which he called for the coalition to be replaced by an
institutional government. The political uncertainty 'risks compromising the
industrial recovery which has now taken off,' he told La Stampa, the
Turin-based newspaper controlled by the Agnelli family.
Other business leaders are privately voicing concern. 'We can no longer say
that the real economy is divorced from the political turmoil,' says an
executive at one of Italy's largest quoted companies.
Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, is maintaining a rosy
forecast for next year's economic growth, but the federation is concerned
that continuing political uncertainty - in particular the risk that a new
government would have to introduce painful supplementary budget measures in
early 1995 - could deter companies from investing in new plant and creating
new jobs.
Mr Luigi Tessera, managing director of Tepak, a manufacturer of padded
envelopes based near Turin, says the economic environment for small
companies in his region is now better than it was six months ago. But he
admits that local companies are worried about what lies ahead. His solution,
however, is to press ahead with investment. 'We need to invest to reinforce
our business against these moments of uncertainty.'
One fear is that the persistent weakness of the lira could trigger a new
spiral of inflation. Exporters admit they have reaped the benefit of a weak
currency, after its September 1992 devaluation. But even they were not
expecting the lira to reach the levels recorded this week: yesterday it
touched a record low of L1,050 to the D-Mark, compared with about L988 just
before the March elections.
Mr Daniele Vacchi of IMA, a medium-sized family owned Bologna manufacturer
of packaging machinery, says: 'The weak lira isn't a 360-degree advantage:
we are in a high-technology area and have to buy some raw materials,
semi-finished goods and electronic components abroad. These goods are
increasing in price.'
One counterweight to inflation would be a further rise in interest rates,
but that would increase pressure on those companies still nursing borrowings
from the recession and directly hinder investment.
Entrepreneurs also say Italy's poor image abroad is increasingly bad for
business, especially when competing for contracts against competitors from
Germany.
The concern now is that in the scramble to form a new coalition or, worse
still, in the chaotic run-up to new elections, some of the worthy aims of
the Berlusconi government may be sacrificed or postponed. There is a risk,
for example, that the ambitious privatisation timetable could suffer delays,
further disillusioning international investors.
Business hopes for an institutional government - a non-party government of
technocrats - which could calm the frenzied political atmosphere, and unite
all in the national interest.
Significantly, Mr Giulio Tremonti, Italy's finance minister, made a point on
Monday of stressing that his newly launched white paper on fiscal reform had
all-party support. The paper, which proposes simplification of Italy's
Byzantine tax system, has been eagerly awaited by individuals as well as
small and medium-sized companies, labouring under a heavy bureaucratic
burden.
'Fiscal reform is a constitutional reform and therefore needs the
participation of the opposition as well,' Mr Tremonti said on Monday.
However, given the acrimony likely to be generated between government and
opposition in the next few days, that could be easier said than done.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Self-interest of Berlusconi allies holds key to his fate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Silvio Berlusconi's increasingly desperate appeals for support may
reach some receptive ears among Italian television audiences, especially
those watching his three Fininvest channels, but they are unlikely to sway
deputies in today's debate in parliament on a confidence vote. They will be
influenced by self-interest and the perception of Mr Berlusconi's future as
a political leader.
The anti-government vote in the chamber of deputies must be assured of 316
votes to win a majority in the 630-seat lower house. The present coalition
is made up of
Forza Italia, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi, and the
neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. The minor partners are the small
right-wing rump of the old Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic
Centre (CCD) and the Radicals of Mr Marco Pannella.
Mr Bossi has decided he can no longer co-habit with Mr Berlusconi and his
right-wing allies, and has turned to form a Liberal Democrat axis with
opposition parties in the centre. The League's desertion immediately reduces
what has been a substantial majority in the chamber of deputies to a
minority. In the Senate, where the government has at best enjoyed a majority
of one, the majority would disappear even more dramatically.
The extent to which Mr Bossi's defection cuts Mr Berlusconi's parliamentary
backing will only become clear with the confidence vote, probably as late as
Friday. The League is divided and reportedly as many as 40 in both houses
are not prepared to walk away from the coalition. These MPs argue they were
elected with the help of Forza Italia votes and that a shift from the
coalition would mean embracing a deal with the dominant opposition force on
the left, the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
Mr Bossi needs the loyalty of a good 60 deputies to demonstrate he still
commands the bulk of this northern movement, which is committed to a more
federally governed Italy. Yesterday he was indicating he had about 80
deputies and all but a handful of the League senators.
If this is the case, Mr Berlusconi would find himself at the head of a
minority government and be forced to resign. Even if he were to scrape by
the vote in the lower house, another motion would be brought in the Senate,
which the media magnate turned businessman could not survive.
Mr Berlusconi, sensing an inevitable defeat, now appears determined to seize
the initiative and is almost certain to introduce his own confidence motion.
The premier's tactic is to try to force early elections once he falls.
In the current parliament it would be difficult for Mr Berlusconi's
opponents to form an alternative government as the majority of the
electorate in the March elections voted centre right.
A centre left government could at best muster some 325 seats, insufficient
to guarantee a stable legislature.
Equally Mr Berlusconi, without the bulk of the League, would lack the
necessary numbers, and the opposition centre parties would be unlikely
allies. The coalition and its broadening to the centre would only stand if
Mr Berlusconi himself were to step aside - and he is set on clinging to
power.
Indeed, the only stable majority would be a broad coalition of all the
parties: or all those parties excluding the extremes of Reconstructed
Communism on the left and the MSI on the right. However, such an outcome is
against the express policy of Mr Berlusconi and his closest allies, who will
not easily forego their demand for early elections.
They could even force this conclusion by resigning en masse from parliament.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Le Monde, one of France's best-known daily newspapers, is to turn itself
into a conventional company and bring in substantial outside investment in
the latest example of the sector's attempts to stave off losses, writes
Andrew Jack in Paris.
The restructuring, which was approved by shareholders earlier this week, is
designed to inject FFr220m (Pounds 26.15m) in new capital and will overhaul
the complex old-fashioned corporate legal structure put in place to preserve
the paper's editorial independence.
Le Monde, which has become a French institution since its creation just 50
years ago, celebrated its anniversary on Monday with facsimiles of earlier
editions, demonstrating just how little the basic design and logo has
altered.
That will all change in January, under a new format introduced as part of
the restructuring plan in preparation since autumn 1993. Mrs Anne
Chaussebourg, a senior executive, said yesterday the new editorial approach
represented 'a strong innovation, not a revolution' with greater emphasis on
business and international economic stories.
The liberal-leaning paper has generated many enemies in the French
establishment over the years, including President Francois Mitterrand who
recently said he no longer read it.
The new plan will see the paper available for sale an hour earlier in Paris.
Mrs Chaussebourg said the aim was to boost sales by at least 5 per cent by
the end of 1995, by which time Le Monde should have broken even before
becoming profitable from 1996. This year it made losses of about FFr20m.
Earlier this week, Liberation, another Paris-based daily newspaper,
announced a recapitalisation of FFr75m.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Pact defuses Gibraltar drugs trade row: Spain to ease
'intrusive frontier checks' following complaints by London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain and Spain yesterday defused a diplomatic row over Gibraltar by
agreeing to develop more formal arrangements for tackling drugs trafficking
and other illicit trade between the UK colony and the Spanish mainland.
A joint statement issued after talks between Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, and Mr Javier Solana, his Spanish counterpart, in London, said
that both sides had recognised there was 'a problem of illegal trafficking
in the Gibraltar area'. Both ministers agreed to establish a 'mechanism',
which should include Gibraltarian officials, to 'improve consultation and
co-operation' between all three sides.
Mr Hurd said the authority would consists of 'two flags (Spain and the UK)
and three voices (Spanish, British, and Gibraltarian)'; in other words, that
the move would not impinge on either country's sovereignty claim over the
colony.
However, Spanish officials feel the proposal is a concession by the UK in
that it potentially allows Madrid a greater say in Gibraltarian affairs.
Spanish concerns that the UK was not doing enough to prevent Gibraltar
becoming a big drugs smuggling and money laundering centre led Madrid
earlier this month to step up border controls.
The move fuelled resentment within Gibraltar and drew a diplomatic protest
from the UK over what London claimed were 'intrusive' checks by Spanish
police.
Yesterday Spain agreed to lift secondary checks at the Gibraltar border to
pave the way for greater diplomatic co-operation with the UK within the
wider context of the EU.
Mr Solana, in an interview, hailed the agreement on the illicit trade as a
breakthrough in talks which underlined points of common interest on EU
matters but which otherwise made little headway on long-standing differences
over sovereignty in Gibraltar.
'The Gibraltarian economy has to be put on a more healthy footing. You
cannot have an economy which is not sound,' he said.
Mr Hurd said separately: 'I made clear to Mr Solana that intrusive frontier
checks were not welcome. . . and stressed the need to build up confidence.'
According to officials, both sides agreed, at least for the foreseeable
future, to disagree on the issue of sovereignty rather than risk a
confrontation with the Gibraltarian government.
Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister, has lashed out recently at both
London and Madrid whom he has accused of approving a 'dirty tricks' campaign
to destabilise his government.
But yesterday Mr Hurd appeared to have appeased Mr Bossano by reiterating
the UK commitment to a clause in Gibraltar's 1969 constitution. This
guarantees that the UK will not cede the colony to Spain against the wishes
of the majority of the population.
Last night the Gibraltarian government issued a conciliatory statement of
its 'desire to work in close co-operation' with the UK and 'in harmony with
its neighbour'.

Germany's money supply grew more slowly than expected in November, bringing
it to the top of the Bundesbank's target range for this year. M3 grew at a
seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 6 per cent in the month after 6.8
per cent in October and 7.8 per cent in September. The target range for 1994
is between 4 per cent and 6 per cent, a level the central bank is expected
to leave unchanged, or alter only slightly, when it sets the 1995 target
tomorrow. Earlier this year, M3 was growing at rates of between 10 and 20
per cent, before the bank cut interest rates to encourage investors to move
funds to longer term investments outside the M3 definition.
Economists had expected the November figure to be just below 6.5 per cent.
However, the recent introduction of money market funds (not in M3) for
German investors distorted the picture, noted UBS in Frankfurt. 'Without
them, M3 would still be well above target,' it said. The Bundesbank also
said M3 growth had eased because of high monetary capital formation, with
three times as much money moving to longer term investments as in November,
1993.
French consumer purchases of manufactured goods rose by 1.7 per cent in
November after a 2.5 per cent drop in October, the economy ministry said
yesterday, claiming that this showed recovery was well established. Durable
goods buying was particularly strong, with a 4.9 per cent increase last
month. At the same time, Insee, the official statistics agency, produced
revised figures underlining the pause in the economy earlier in the autumn.
It now estimates that manufacturing output fell in October by 0.5 per cent,
after having already fallen by 0.4 per cent in September.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Brussels plan on cross-border jobs set to fail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European Union draft directive to provide basic employment rights for
workers posted by their employers to work in another EU country looks set to
fail at a special meeting of EU social affairs ministers called to discuss
it in Brussels today.
Ministers appear to have been unable to reach agreement during the past
fortnight ago over the controversial directive, which many European
employers see as a burden on business.
The Commission wants the directive to set up minimum legal standards for
posted workers to prevent them being exploited, through undercutting of
local labour market standards.
Mr Michael Portillo, the UK's employment secretary, is likely to draw
comfort from the disarray among the member states over the directive.
Portugal, Greece and Italy are sceptical of the proposal as many employers
fear it would force them to increase pay for seconded workers in member
states with higher wages.
'Bar a miracle today, the directive will not get through the Council. It is
getting more difficult all the time', a Commission official said yesterday.
However, Mr Padraig Flynn, the EU's social affairs commissioner, will not
give up pressing for legislation covering posted workers during the French
presidency of the EU, beginning on January 1.
Today's probable outcome will be a setback to Mr Norbert Blum, Germany's
labour minister, who had hoped to crown Germany's presidency of the EU with
a victory over an issue that has troubled the Commission for years.
But it now seems likely it will be left to each member state to decide
whether or not to introduce domestic legislation to protect indigenous
employers from competition through lower-cost labour used by foreign
companies.
'Mr Portillo should not crow about this. The EU directive would have been a
minimalist measure. Now there is a real danger that some EU states will
bring in laws that will undermine the position of posted workers', an
official said.
Divisions in the Council centre on how long a worker has to be posted to be
covered by the directive. Some ministers want it to apply to all posted
workers while others favour a four to six-month period before it applies.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Kuwait is offered Pounds 1.5bn for property company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 1.5bn offer to buy the St Martins Property group, the leading
property business owned by the Kuwaiti government, has been made by Barings,
the London merchant bank, on behalf of an investment consortium.
St Martins owns some of London's most valuable property, including the strip
on the south bank of the Thames known as London Bridge City. Only half of
that site has been developed.
It also owns other prime developments, such as the City headquarters of the
Kuwait Investment Organisation, the Kuwaiti government's international
investment arm, and offices, retail developments and industrial units in the
UK and on the Continent.
The bid is the most dramatic indication to date that investor confidence in
the property sector may be returning.
Although property prices have recovered from their lows of two years ago,
the share prices of leading property companies have performed much worse
than the market average this year.
Barings has yet to receive an official response from the Kuwaiti government
but a senior official last night appeared hostile to the proposed sale.
Dr Yousef Al-Awadi, general manager of the KIO, said the government was not
soliciting offers: 'As far as we are concerned, it is not for sale,' he
added.
The offer was made late last month at a meeting in Kuwait between Barings,
accompanied by the London arm of French bank Credit Lyonnais, and Mr Ali
Rashid Al-Badr, who is in charge of the Kuwaiti government's investments. It
was repeated in a fax sent just over a week ago.
The value of St Martins' assets is uncertain because most are held directly
by the Kuwaiti government through a nominee company, St Martins Property
Investments, and their value is not disclosed in accounts filed at Companies
House.
Under this arrangement Kuwait benefits from a convention that assets owned
directly by a sovereign or government are immune from taxes.
A former Kuwaiti government official said yesterday that the properties were
valued at Pounds 1.9bn at their peak in the late 1980s, before the property
recession.
Last year the St Martins group paid an estimated dividend of Pounds 60m to
Kuwait. This year's payment is expected to be lower.
A financier associated with St Martins said the group's development was
being held back by a shortage of capital.
The Kuwaiti government bought St Martins in 1974, in a bidding contest with
property group Commercial Union.
Since the 1991 Gulf war, Kuwait has been selling some of its more liquid
investments, although it has retained the majority of assets, such as St
Martins, which are not quoted on the stock market.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Part-time workers win new rights: Government climbdown in
wake of law lords' judgment dismays employers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's 6m part-time workers are to have most of the statutory employment
rights of those in full-time jobs, the government announced yesterday.
The decision, mainly affecting women, represents a climbdown for the
government, which two weeks ago vetoed a draft European Union directive on
part-time workers. It follows a judgment against the government by the law
lords earlier this year over the different legal rights of part-time and
full-time workers.
It will bring Britain in line with European Union equality laws. An
estimated 750,000 employees, working less than 16 hours a week and in
continuous service with their employer for over two years, will have new
rights covering unfair dismissal and redundancy payments, extended maternity
leave, a written statement of employment, time off for union activities and
notice of dismissal.
Under current legislation passed in 1975 they have had to wait five years to
qualify for equal treatment with full-time employees.
The decision was announced in a written Commons reply by Mr Michael
Portillo, employment secretary, who earlier this month vetoed the draft
directive because he said it would impose intolerable constraints on job
creation.
Yesterday he said the government was still convinced the removal from UK
employment protection legislation of all existing distinctions based on the
number of hours worked each week would make employers reluctant to create
new part-time jobs for women and threaten the security of existing
employees.
The effects of the changes would be 'carefully monitored to assess their
impact on business and on employment opportunities', he said. 'The
government will reconsider the position in due course if objective evidence
of adverse effects emerge.'
The government always 'honoured its legal obligations' and accepted it had
to comply with the law lords' judgment. But Mr Portillo claimed that the
ruling 'clearly gives the relevant European legislation a much wider
interpretation than was envisaged when it was originally adopted'.
The law lords case was brought by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which
claimed the laws discriminated against women workers; 87 per cent of
part-time workers are women.
Ms Kamlesh Bahl, EOC chairman, said last night she was 'delighted' at what
she called a 'a major victory' for women workers.
However, some employer organisations expressed dismay at the government's
decision. Dr Ann Robinson, head of the Institute of Directors' policy unit,
described it as 'another submission to a piece of nonsense legislation from
Europe'.
It was the 'thin end of the wedge' that would lead on to equal rights for
part-timers in holiday entitlement and pension provision.
The Federation of Small Businesses said it was gravely concerned at the
effect of the decision on its members. Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation
of British Industry's employment affairs director, said the decision brought
a 'welcome clarification to the law', though it would hit small employers.
The government would now have to end all forms of discrimination against
part-time workers, said Ms Harriet Harman, shadow employment secretary.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said trade unions would continue
campaigning for complete equality between part-time and full-time workers.
Part-time employees were already protected over sex and race discrimination,
unlawful deductions from wages by employers and time off for antenatal care,
according to the Department of Employment.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Intel offers to replace Pentium microchips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Intel, the world's biggest computer chip maker, is offering to replace free
of charge the flawed Pentium microprocessors that are the 'brains' of
millions of high performance personal computers.
To cover the cost of the 'no questions asked' offer, which follows thousands
of customer complaints over the past month on the Internet global computer
network, the US group will take a 'material' reserve against earnings in the
current quarter.
About 5m Pentium chips have been shipped to date, but Intel said it had no
idea how many customers would request replacement. The company's reserve, to
be determined, will include the cost of new chips and some of the cost of
installing them. The company apologised for its handling of the controversy
over the flawed chips which can cause computers to produce errors in
division calculations.
Previously Intel had only agreed to replace chips in machines used by
customers with a proven need for accurate complex computations.
After yesterday's announcement, Intel's share price rose in New York from
Dollars 57 13/16 to close at Dollars 61 1/4 . Analysts said the decision
would help to end 'hysterical media coverage'.
Mr Andrew Grove, Intel's president and chief executive, said: 'Our previous
policy was to talk with (Pentium PC) users to determine whether their needs
required replacement of the processor. There was a resentment to our
approach - it appeared that we at Intel were arrogant, we were telling
customers what was good for them. Maybe we have been thick-headed. . . but
we finally figured it out.'
Wide publicity was drawn to the Pentium problem by an IBM announcement a
week ago that it was halting shipments of computers using Pentium chips. IBM
said the Pentium could produce an error every 24 days.
Intel, however, maintains that such errors were likely to occur only once in
every 9bn calculations, or once in every 27,000 years, and would not affect
most users. IBM's figures have also been rejected by several other PC
manufacturers, including Compaq, the world's largest.
Sales to individual and small businesses of computers containing Pentium
chips have remained strong despite the negative publicity, Intel said. The
company is, however, concerned that large company purchases planned for the
first quarter of 1995 could be delayed by the problem.
Intel is making new versions of the Pentium chip and expects to be able to
meet requests for replacements within 60 days. The company does not expect
any long-term impact on sales.
Customers wanting their chips replaced will be sent instructions on how to
do so themselves, or can take their computers to a service centre. The chip
replacement offer will remain in effect for the lifetime of the computer.
Intel's customer inquiry numbers are: 01793 696776 in the UK and
1-800-628-8686 in the US.

FT  21 DEC 94 / AT&amp;T wins UK licence for full range of telephone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms carrier, has been given the go-ahead to offer
a full range of telephone services in the UK, a move which will sharply
intensify competition in the British telecoms market.
The granting of a public telecommunications operator's licence to AT&amp;T was
announced yesterday by Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, who
also announced a similar licence for Concert, a joint venture between BT and
MCI of the US.
The announcement had been widely expected. AT&amp;T made its application in
April 1993 and approval in principle was issued in the summer. The
government's decision to award AT&amp;T a full licence, however, gives the US
company an immediate advantage in its struggle with BT for the lion's share
of the lucrative transatlantic business traffic.
AT&amp;T will be able to provide domestic, switched voice and data services,
private line and, importantly, 'international simple resale' services in the
UK.
International simple resale - a leased-line service which offers
multinational companies cut-price transatlantic networks - is growing
rapidly in importance.
AT&amp;T's entry into the market is likely to bring lower telecoms costs for
business customers on the transatlantic route where 'resellers' - US
companies such as WorldCom or ACC - are already undercutting BT and Mercury
Communications, the two largest UK telecoms operators.
BT, however, is still waiting for the US Federal Communications Commission
to give it approval to operate international simple resale between the US
and UK.
It already has partial approval and is hoping that the FCC will move quickly
now that the UK has given AT&amp;T the go-ahead.
Concert, based in Washington, aims to provide 'one-stop' telecoms services
for multinational companies. It has been operating mainly in data services
since the US authorities gave partial approval to the BT-MCI alliance in
June this year.
Mr David Quinn, AT&amp;T's European marketing director, said the company would
be investing in the UK on a scale reflecting its ambition to be a force in
the business and residential markets.
He said the intention was not to double up on services available but build
on AT&amp;T's technological strength and experience in the US to offer new
services. Next year, he said, these would include frame relay  - a
high-speed communications method between computer systems, international
leased lines and advanced business networks.
He said the company planned an orderly approach to the UK market. Services
would first be provided over existing networks through partnerships with
cable companies. In the long term, AT&amp;T would be prepared to build its own
network including the 'local loop' between the exchange and the home or
office.

China is to introduce a regulation preventing foreigners from taking part in
joint ventures to produce colour televisions unless they import advanced
technology, the English-language state-run China Daily said, Reuter reports
in Beijing.
'No advanced technology, no market, that is the ministry's policy,' the
newspaper quoted Zhang Jinqiang, vice-minister for the electronics industry,
as saying.
Foreign companies are eager to set up joint ventures in China with the aim
of gaining a larger slice of China's huge market for home appliances, the
newspaper said. Since introducing its first colour television production
line in 1980, China has invested Yuan 20bn (Pounds 1.5bn) in the industry.
China has an annual output capacity of 20m colour televisions a year and 15m
tubes; last year it ranked third in the world after South Korea and the US,
with output of 13m sets, the China Daily said.
Production is expected to reach 14m sets this year and 18m-20m by the end of
the century. China exported 4.6m sets last year and the ministry hopes to
raise this to 8m by the year 2000.
The production value of colour televisions accounts for about 40 per cent of
the total of the electronics industry.
About 80 per cent of urban families but only 10 per cent of rural families
have colour television sets.
China has 51 colour television manufacturers, of which five produce more
than 1m sets a year.
The demand for large-screen colour televisions has increased rapidly in
cities in recent years, the newspaper said.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Vietnam attacks book pirates: Still loopholes in Hanoi's new
copyright law, critics say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Vietnam's recent copyright law brings protection up to international
standards, but in 'photocopy city', where books can be reproduced for a few
dollars, loopholes still exist, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
National Assembly president Nong Duc Manh signed the ordinance protecting
the copyright of the works of Vietnamese authors last week, according to
newspaper reports.
'It's a good law in most ways,' said Ms Tanya Pullin, a specialist on
intellectual property rights with White and Case, a New York law firm. 'It's
an international-standard law that covers the things copyright should cover,
such as books, music and computer software.' The ordinance would help
Vietnam join the Berne Convention on copyright.
But until it is admitted to the convention, a serious flaw in foreign eyes
is the ordinance's stipulation that foreign authors must publish their works
in Vietnam to qualify for copyright protection there. If they are published
abroad, they must be published in Vietnam within 30 days to qualify.
In practice, few foreign authors of books, or composers, will do so. But
computer software companies may well want to protect their works in this
growing market.
'It means we would have to release simultaneously in Vietnam and the US, in
English,' said Ms Maureen Flanagan, country manager of the US company
Unisys. Computer software piracy was 'standard procedure' in Vietnam and had
been encouraged by the US trade embargo, which Washington rescinded in
February.
Because legal imports of US software had been banned before then, the
Vietnamese 'got in the habit of importing and copying', she added. 'It's
worse here than China or Thailand.'
When Vietnam joins the Berne Convention, it will have to extend copyright
laws applicable to its own nationals to foreign authors, too. 'But until
they join the convention, the 30-day rule is a big loophole,' Ms Pullin
said.
Mr Cameron McCullough, of Sly and Weigall/Deacons, an Australia-based law
firm, said the protection offered to computer software was the key element
of the law.
Vietnam is keen to develop an information technology (IT) industry as well
as a publishing one. 'A copyright law is an essential element for protection
of international property to develop sectors of the publishing industry. It
is important for IT and absolutely critical for development of a software
industry.'
The law covers works including plays, broadcasts, videos, photographs,
architecture, maps and books.
How effective it will be against local piracy remains to be seen. There are
lucrative businesses based on photocopying popular books and documents, and
pirated popular compact discs imported from other Asian countries have
appeared on street stalls in large numbers recently, selling for about
Dollars 1 each.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Warning on costs of protectionism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A senior Indonesian minister yesterday warned that protectionism would raise
local production costs and erode the international competitiveness of
Indonesian industry.
The warning from Mr Ginanjar Kartasasmita, the planning minister, came amid
a growing debate in Indonesia over efforts by a private company, PT Chandra
Asri, to obtain protection for a Dollars 1.7bn petrochemicals complex being
built in west Java. The main backers of the project include President
Suharto's second son Bambang Trihatmodjo.
'We have to be very selective in protecting our firms since this raises
costs for downstream users, which in turn makes these industries less
competitive,' Mr Ginanjar told a conference on manufacturing.
'We have to ensure that protection does not constitute a government subsidy
to non-competitive businesses, denying these resources to infrastructure,
education and health, which are fundamental to our long-term development
success,' he said.
The Chandra Asri debate has been front-page news with economists, former
ministers and finance minister Mar'ie Muhammad speaking out against
protectionism.
The company has asked for tariff barriers of up to 40 per cent for its
plant, which is expected to produce ethylene and propylene. The tariffs
would protect the Chandra Asri plant, due to come on stream next year, from
cheaper imports. The company argues the protection is necessary because it
will take several years before Chandra Asri becomes profitable.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Carter pushes Bosnian Serb offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PALE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jimmy Carter, the US peace mediator, yesterday announced that the Bosnian
Serbs had agreed an immediate ceasefire. He said after talks with their
leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that they were willing to discuss the
international peace plan.
Before the meeting in Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital, the former US
president had walked into controversy when he said that Bosnian Serbs wanted
peace and that Americans 'have primarily heard one side of the story': that
the Bosnian Serbs were the aggressors.
The White House, which has been sceptical of Mr Carter's latest peace foray
and has emphasised that it is not an official mission, immediately disputed
his assertion about which side was the aggressor. 'The Bosnian Serbs are the
aggressors in this war,' a White House spokeswoman said. 'I think the
American people have had an opportunity to see what's happening on the
ground there and to see both sides of the story.'
Mr Carter said after several hours of talks with Mr Karadzic, who had
invited him to undertake his mission, that he would return to Sarajevo to
put the ceasefire proposal to the Moslem-led Bosnian government. Mr Carter
said: 'The Bosnian Serb side agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to
negotiate a lasting cessation of hostilities. While a ceasefire is in place,
Bosnian Serb leaders agree to discuss peace on the basis of the contact
group plan at a mutually acceptable site.'
Mr Carter, said he had informed the White House of the outcome of his
meeting.
There was also controversy over whether the Bosnian Serbs had fulfilled the
pledges they gave to Mr Carter before he agreed to meet them. Since Mr
Karadzic issued his promises last week, Serb forces have attacked
peacekeepers and civilian targets in Sarajevo, blocked UN convoys and
expelled more civilians from Serb-held territory, UN officials reported.
The Bosnian Serbs say publicly they have limited expectations from Mr
Carter's visit. But officials hint privately that the leadership in Pale may
be close to accepting a revised version of peace proposals first presented
by the five-member contact group in the summer. The original plan, they
believe, called on the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from territory before
negotiations on complex issues such as agreed land swaps and links between
the Bosnian Serbs and what remains of Yugoslavia.
'The contact group plan has been changed,' an official said. The latest
version makes it clear that only a ceasefire and verbal commitment are
needed before negotiations begin.
The official said that what the Serbs wanted was 'near to independence. We
are not looking for a seat at the UN. Our idea is to unite with Serbia'.
Unity would not preclude close economic and administrative ties with the
rest of Bosnia, he said.
His remarks appeared at variance with the frequent public insistence that
only full, internationally recognised sovereignty would satisfy the Bosnian
Serbs.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Berlusconi hit by ministers' threat to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government was further undermined yesterday by the prospect of
ministers from the populist Northern League resigning in advance of
tomorrow's no-confidence vote in parliament.
At least three of the five League ministers said they preferred to resign
their portfolios before voting against the right-wing coalition of which
they formed part.
Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the finance minister, went further and became the
first minister to criticise openly Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian
premier, by claiming 'he lacked the ability to run the government'.
But Mr Berlusconi still received support yesterday - albeit lukewarm - from
Mr Roberto Maroni, the interior minister and the most influential League
figure in the cabinet.
Within the movement, backers of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, were
gathering signatures from deputies to check those willing to vote against
the government. Another group was collecting the names of those among the
105 deputies who would either abstain or vote for Mr Berlusconi.
Mr Bossi has tested the loyalty of a sizeable number of deputies by turning
towards the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) as a
potential ally.
Others are concerned that since their election was due to strong backing
from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, they cannot easily break this
link without betraying the electorate.
However, the League is aware that the government has little chance of
survival and that all options should be held open.
Apart from Mr Pagliarini, the two other ministers willing to resign are Mr
Francesco Speroni, in charge of institutional reform, and Mr Vito Gnutti,
industry minister. Mr Pagliarini justified his support for Mr Bossi by
saying the government had failed to fulfil its objectives and that he had
been left to operate in a vacuum.
The stance of the League will be crucial for the eight-month-old government
in the three no-confidence motions due to be debated on consecutive days
from tomorrow.
Mr Bossi needs about 50 deputies to remain loyal to ensure the downfall of
the government. He has sponsored one no-confidence motion in tandem with the
Popular party (PPI) of Mr Rocco Buttiglione as part of what he says is a new
Liberal Democrat axis.
Tension will heighten as the government and opposition seek to drum up
support and organise street demonstrations.
The financial markets registered their concern over the increasing
instability by forcing the lira to fall close to yet another psychological
barrier - L1,050 to the D-Mark.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Balladur in fresh offensive on jobs
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, yesterday proposed to cut
sickness insurance charges for lower-paid workers, in another move to
encourage hiring by French employers and to reduce the country's high
unemployment.
The proposal, made in Le Monde newspaper, comes amid other signs that the
debate between Gaullist contenders for the presidency is lurching to the
left, on to political terrain left vacant by Mr Jacques Delors' refusal to
be the Socialist candidate.
Mr Balladur has already shifted some of the burden of family allowance
charges from companies to the state budget. But despite public pressure from
the Bank of France to close the public deficit, he now proposes making the
same switch for sickness insurance charges.
Reducing such charges on lower-paid workers would cost the state FFr13bn
(Dollars 2.53bn), and a total of FFr60bn if extended to all employees, Mr
Balladur said.
In his broad-ranging article, he said he would use France's presidency of
the European Union which starts next month to propose to the EU's 15 members
a convention on employment, social security protection and vocational
training.
The swing to the left is being led by Mr Jacques Chirac who launched his
first big campaign rally in Lyons last week with an attack on the country's
conservative rulers.
In another sign of France's shifting political landscape, pro-Chirac
deputies joined the socialist and communist opposition yesterday to pass a
resolution urging the government not to agree to a new international code
against direct subsidies to shipbuilders. However, the government appears
committed to joining the rest of the EU in approving the code.

FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern Electric forged ahead 33 to 1018p as the market braced itself for a
long drawn out bid battle after Trafalgar House finally launched its
long-awaited Pounds 1.2m bid for the distributor. Northern issued a
statement after the market closed rejecting the offer.
Active trading of the stock following news of the bid saw volume rise to a
hefty 4.8m shares by the close. Last week's confirmation by Trafalgar that
it was considering a bid for Northern meant yesterday's move was not a
surprise, but dealers suggested: 'This is only the opening shot for what
will be a bitter battle.'
More cautious observers such as Mr Nigel Hawkins at Hoare Govett suggested
that the bid could be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
However, the general view was that Trafalgar could eventually capture its
prize but would have to 'substantially' increase its current offer.
Mr Kevin Lapwood at Smith New Court said: 'The tax benefits to Trafalgar
added to the break-up value of Northern, which we believe to be 1125p,
should see a take-out price of more than 1200p.' The current offer from
Trafalgar House values each Northern share at 1077p, with the cash
alternative at 1048p.
Mr Adam Forsyth and Mr Richard Alderman at NatWest Securities said simply:
'We view the Trafalgar bid for Northern as fairly priced but not high enough
to win round the company's management. Without that support, persuading
share holders to accept could be difficult.'
The emergence of a 'white knight' has not been ruled out, and several market
participants continued to point to Scottish Power as a probable suitor.
Shares in that group shed 5 to 332p on the talk. Trafalgar eased a penny to
73p.
A combination of a stock shortage, general recovery and reports of
encouraging sales of video tapes and compact discs helped Kingfisher advance
15 to 429p, in trade of 3.2m.
There was a big seller of Storehouse which left the shares trailing 4 1/4 at
208p xd. Volume of 1.7m included a block of 700,000 that was dealt at 209p.
The stock had until recently been one of the better performers in an
otherwise dull retail sector.
Among food retailers, two-way business in Asda Group brought volume of 10m
shares, making it the day's most actively traded stock in the Footsie. The
share price hardened  1/2 to 64 1/2 p.
Negative press comment weakened drinks group Bass and the shares closed 3
1/2 cheaper at 516p. Worries about the growing 'bootleg' beer market cast a
shadow over brewing group Vaux. The shares gave up 6 at 220p.
Bid speculation boosted several stocks among the regional electricity
companies. East Midlands, which brought the results season in the recs to a
close with bumper figures, raced 41 ahead to 851p, while London put on 31 at
774p.
Hong Kong related stocks HSBC and Standard Chartered fell 1 1/2 to 698p and
4 to 278p following criticism in the financial press over the Far Eastern
market's prospects.
Merchant bank SG Warburg lost more of its bid premium following a welter of
comment in the weekend press. The bank also announced that it was losing one
of its senior directors, Mr Peter Twatchmann, and some insiders were
suggesting the change was linked to comments Mr Twatchmann had made about
Warburg's fixed interest division  - thus highlighting the group's internal
strife. The shares fell 28 to 685p. Some investors were switching into
Kleinwort Benson, up 12 at 535p.
Pharmaceuticals group Huntingdon International leapt 10 to 30p after
announcing a new chairman, Mr Roger Pinnington.
Reckitt &amp; Colman rose 8 to 593p after its proposed acquisition of LK&amp;F
Household was approved by shareholders.
Wellcome fell 7 to 678p, with dealers suggesting that investors had been
switching funds into Glaxo, which was held back on Friday by some negative
sentiment. Glaxo shares moved forward 13 1/2 to 639 1/2 p.
Fisons was restrained, but news that it had ended its US marketing agreement
with Rhone Poulenc came too late to hit the shares significantly and they
finished unchanged at 114p.
However, one analyst said the news essentially marked the end of the US
prospects for Tilade, the asthma treatment and Fisons most important drug.
Oil major BP was one of the most heavily traded stocks as a rise of 3 1/2 to
425p, against 375p ex-dividend for BT, ensured a change of leadership at the
top of the FT-SE 100 league table and consolidated the oil group's
rehabilitation in the eyes of investors.
Pict Petroleum rose 14 to 155p after the company became the latest to join
the increasingly popular bid club. The oil group issued a statement saying
its 48.3 per cent shareholder Amerada Hess was in talks with Premier
Consolidated Oilfields that could lead to a bid for all of Pict's share
capital. Shares of Premier rose 1 1/2 to 23p.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi dipped 3 to 151p following consideration of the
implications of the management upheavals.
US press comment sent Cable and Wireless rattling ahead in 5.9m turnover,
with the stock market beginning to scent the possibility of some sort of
hive-off. The shares climbed 7 to 368 1/2 p.

FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portals bid news expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Specialist paper group Portals jumped 45 to 965p as the company's executive
directors held face to face negotiations with their counterparts from De La
Rue, the banknote printer.
The boards of the two groups spent much of yesterday thrashing out details
that are expected to lead to a killer bid worth in excess of Pounds 10 a
share from De La Rue.
It is believed that the highest amount De La Rue could justifiably pay would
be 1025p per share, which would value Portals at Pounds 665m. There will be
an announcement this week, possibly as early as tomorrow. One insider said:
'With the share price swinging around like this and nobody knowing what is
going on, there is in effect a false market. They have to say something.'
This is the second time this year that De La Rue has declared its interest
in Portals, and analysts believe that if it backs away again there would be
a damaging loss of face and De La Rue would be forced to launch a hostile
bid  - something it has shied away from because of the historically close
relationship between the two groups. De La Rue firmed a penny to 956p.

FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities in good form as bid stories
emerge - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The emergence of a series of actual and potential takeover developments
supplied the ammunition for a strong start to the week in London's equity
market.
Dealers said there were no real surprises with Trafalgar House's bid for
Northern Electric but potential bids for oil group Pict Petroleum and Wills
Group, the industrial concern, were news to the market.
And marketmakers remained on red alert for an expected bid from De La Rue
for Portals, the banknote paper manufacturer.
There was no disguising, however, the beginning of a winding down process in
the market ahead of the Christmas holiday. That was evident in the
relatively low level of turnover  - 477.2m shares  - the lowest for ten
trading sessions. Activity in non FT-SE stocks accounted for 275.8m shares,
or 58 per cent of the overall total. The value of customer business is
expected to fall close to Pounds 1bn; last Friday saw customer business
worth Pounds 1.54bn pass through the market.
A disappointing opening to Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average came in
under pressure and fell over 20 points within an hour of the opening, took
some of the shine off London's excellent showing. There was an element of
uncertainty in the US ahead of today's crucial Federal Open Market Committee
meeting which will ponder US monetary policy.
London traders did not expect any shift in US interest rates until the New
Year. 'We expect the Federal Reserve to wait until it has sieved through the
necessary data on the fourth quarter before it decides on any further
shift,' said the head of strategy at one big European bank.
Looking further ahead, he said there was a faint hope of a reduction in
German interest rates on Thursday when the Bundesbank Council meets in
Frankfurt.
The market's takeover enthusiasm was such that the FT-SE 100 shrugged off a
tired-looking Wall Street and closed 20.8 higher at 3,034.4, its highest for
almost two weeks.
There was also keen support for second-line issues, where the FT-SE Mid 250
index settled 22.9 higher at 3,460.0.
Pride of place however, went to BP, whose rehabilitation was completed as
the stock became the UK equity market's highest capitalised stock for the
first time since the 1980s.
The 100 index began the day some 13 points higher, as the market got wind of
the Trafalgar House offer for Northern Electric, a move which sparked buying
across the whole utilities areas of the market.
Analysts said the Trafalgar move could attract a counter offer from domestic
or overseas predators anxious to acquire the cash generative electricity
company. The generally accepted view around the market was that the bid for
Northern was probably the first of many among the recs. South Wales
Electricity, London, South Western and Norweb remain the other favourite
targets. East Midlands Electricity raced higher, courtesy of a 27 per cent
interim dividend increase.
Dealers pointed to above-average turnover in the recs as the bid speculation
gripped the sector; 'Big turnover is always the precursor of corporate
activity,' said one trader 'and we've seen big activity for two weeks.'
Outside of the utilities and excluding the expected offer for Portals
dealers said there was plenty of activity across various sectors. In a
generally firm retailing sector Kingfisher was outstanding - and the FT-SE
100's best individual performer  - amid talk of buoyant sales.
SG Warburg took the wooden spoon as the worst performer in the 100 index,
with suggestions of great unhappiness around the company's various
departments after the failed merger talks with Morgan Stanley.

FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In trading volumes which displayed end of year thinness, stock index futures
moved ahead briskly, opening up a wide premium to the cash market, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 March contract was standing at 3,062 at the close of pit
trading, up 20 points for a 69-point advance over the past two trading days.
At the official close the premium to the cash market was 28 points, but at
times, notably during the morning session, this widened to more than 30
points.
As a result a certain amount of arbitrage business went through, although
underlying turnover remained modest. The day saw just 9,216 lots traded.
Turnover stayed weak during late, screen-based trading, but with Wall Street
showing clear signs of weakness the March contract sagged to 3,059, at which
level it was a couple of points above fair value.
The thinness of the market was also reflected in stock option trading, where
lot numbers tailed away to 26,292, from 44,805 on Friday. Calls outstripped
puts by nearly two-to-one. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for
around 11,500 contracts.
The most actively traded individual stock option was Abbey National, with
2,134 lots dealt. Cable and Wireless, Welcome and British Gas were also well
traded.

FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Profits taken after Dow's
recent gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US share prices retreated from Friday's gains yesterday as traders took
profits after last week's advance, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 16.49 off at 3,790.70. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 lost 0.89 at 457.91, the American Stock Exchange composite eased
0.50 to 425.73 and the Nasdaq composite shed 1.16 to 727.91. New York Stock
Exchange trading volume came to 272m shares.
Analysts attributed much of last week's strength to Friday's
'triple-witching hour' when options and futures on stock indices expired
together in the last 60 minutes of trading. With that out of the way and no
important economic news out yesterday, there was little to push up the
market.
Investors were also acting cautiously in advance of today's meeting of the
Federal Reserve's open market committee. Most analysts are betting that the
Fed will not lift rates at the meeting, but opinion is not unanimous.
Interest rate rises usually push the market down as investors worry that
reduced consumption and borrowing will erode corporate earnings.
In recent weeks the market has moved up and down skittishly as investors
first worried about another rate rise and then bought when those fears
subsided briefly. A round of relatively mild economic news put out last week
led many to speculate that the Fed would not raise rates again before
January.
Caesars World rocketed Dollars 20 3/4 to Dollars 66 after ITT said it would
acquire the casino company for Dollars 67.50 per share, or Dollars 1.7bn.
ITT dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 81 1/2 .
US Shoe rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 19 after an investor group at the
company said it would back the sale of its footwear business to Nine West,
Dollars  3/8 firmer at Dollars 26 5/8 .
Ben &amp; Jerry's fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 after the ice cream company
announced that it expected a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 700,000 to
Dollars 900,000 and a decline in revenues from the same period last year.
Revenues should be about Dollars 30m, the company said.
Canada
Toronto stocks were no worse than mixed as Wall Street declined. Hearty
gains in banking shares and golds provided the bulk of the fuel for a rise
of 18.72 points to a closing 4,136.75 for the TSE 300 index. Declines and
rises were almost evenly matched at 385 to 384 after volume of 55.7m shares.
Ten of the 14 sub-indices advanced, led by gold, financial, communication
and industrial-product stocks. Conglomerates, consumer products, oils and
merchandising posted the biggest declines.
The golds group added 0.91 per cent, even though the New York spot bullion
price eased 35 cents to USDollars 379.75 an ounce.
Mexico
Equities finished sharply lower after reports came through of fresh trouble
in the southern state of Chiapas. The IPC index dropped 95.93 or 4.12 per
cent to 2,231.66  - at the end of 1993 it stood at 2,602.63. Volume was a
modest 31.2m shares worth 390.4m new pesos.
The Zapatista rebels said they had turned down an offer from the government
of a multi-party commission to negotiate peace. Traders said key Mexican
rates are likely to see increases at the central bank's weekly auction
tomorrow because of nerves stemming from Chiapas.

FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rise in carmakers enlivens
Frankfurt bourse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Friday's surge in the Dow lifted bourses in the morning, but its
subsidence yesterday left them subdued, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's Dax index came back from an intraday high of 2,092.17 to close
just 5.88 up at 2,075.94. In the post bourse, it eased further to an
Ibis-indicated 2,066.59.
Turnover fell from DM8.6bn, inflated by Frankfurt's own triple-witching
process, to DM5.2bn. Carmakers were the prime feature of the day, BMW,
Daimler and Volkswagen rising DM12 to DM760, DM10.50 to DM757.50 and DM4.90
to DM427.90 respectively on the session, and the first two retaining about
half of their gains after hours.
At James Capel, Mr Bob Barber noted that the sector, the best performer in
Europe until the end of October, had underperformed both in November and in
this month to date. It was too late, he added, for share prices to be
responding to last week's sharp upturn in November's European car
registrations; and BMW's supply deal with Rolls Royce was better for
prestige than it was for profits of any scale. It looked, he concluded, as
if a trader-oriented market was simply indulging in a little more sector
rotation.
AMSTERDAM, too, retreated from early gains, the AEX index adding 2.47 to
410.85 after an earlier high of 412.88.
Paribas remarked in its latest perspective that it was
shifting its stance toward a more defensive investment strategy and away
from cyclicals. However, brokers noted some interest in the cyclical sector
yesterday with Hoogovens adding Fl 1.60 to Fl 74.40 and DSM up Fl 1.10 to Fl
135.20.
Fokker, which suffered heavy selling last week after it warned of heavier
than expected losses in 1994, recovered 80 cents to Fl 12.00, after a high
of Fl 12.40.
MILAN saw the battered lira, near an all time low against the D-Mark,
provoke bargain hunting, particularly among foreign investors. The Comit
index rose 1.49 to 607.26, largely ignoring political developments which
suggested that the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister,
was limping towards a parliamentary vote of no confidence, later in the
week.
Blue chips led the gains with Fiat, which has been attracting positive
comment from analysts, L88 higher at L5,795.
Montedison rose L14 to L1,141 but Ferruzzi dipped L27 to L1,140 as it was
penalised for writing off credits from its former holding company, Serafino
Ferruzzi, which could result in extra losses of L250bn in the 1994 accounts.
Credito Romagnolo picked up L32 to L18,916 as hopes appeared to fade that
Credito Italiano would launch a counterbid to Cariplo's L21,500 a share
offer, regarded as high by many analysts. Credito Italiano was L54 higher at
L1,650.
PARIS offered a minimal advance with the CAC-40 index 3.93 higher at
1,928.09. Turnover was low at around FFr2.5bn.
Generale des Eaux, which went against the trend with a fall of FFr5 to
FFr509, after an early high of FFr524, was upgraded to market performer by
Goldman Sachs. The US investment bank said that it had based its re-rating
on the group's potential for restructuring and refocusing under new
management. In addition the stock had underperformed the CAC by some 16 per
cent since the start of the year.
ZURICH lost a fraction, the SMI index receding 4.0 to 2,600.7as the market
waited for today's FOMC meeting in the US.
US selling left Swiss Re SFr21 lower at SFr766 as investors decided that
there was limited potential from further gains after the recent strong
performance.
UBS bearers fell SFr23 to SFr1,062, with the bank seen as a seller in its
own shares.
Second-tier shares saw Ascom SFr20 higher SFr1,300 as it benefited from the
naming of a new chief executive.
Georg Fischer rose SFr70 to SFr1,600 after the engineering group reiterated
that it still expected 1994 group net profit to exceed SFr50m.
BRUSSELS fell back slightly overall, while Union Miniere continued to
attract interest. The Bel-20 slipped 0.69 to 1,393.75 as the shares of the
metals group lost BFr20 to BFr2,490.
Brokers commented that Union Miniere had been heavily traded on technical
factors after the expiry of a warrant last Thursday. There was news that a
1.1 per cent stake in the company had been sold by SGB, off BFr5 at
BFr2,185.
MADRID's general index fell 1.58 to 296.37.
Telefonica was a sizeable loser, closing Pta35, or 2.1 per cent down at
Pta1,610.
Dealers said that the market was unsettled by the appearance before a high
court judge yesterday of Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banesto, to
testify in connection with alleged criminal acts that contributed to the
banking group's crisis a year ago.
COPENHAGEN was little changed, the KFX index edging 0.04 higher to 91.58 as
Danisco rose DKr3 or 1.5 per cent to DKr206 on sharply better than expected
first half results.
TEL AVIV, following a 2.71 drop to 170.66 in the Mishtanim index on Sunday,
speculated on possible changes in the upcoming capital gains tax on
securities transaction profits, and took the index up 5.71, or 3 per cent to
175.87 at one point.
However, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, said in the afternoon
that the tax was to be implemented as scheduled on January 1, and the
Mishtanim dropped to close 1.13 lower at 169.53.

FT  20 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei 225 ends higher
for fourth day in succession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei 225 average gained ground for the fourth consecutive trading day.
Friday's rise on Wall Street pushed up futures prices and prompted arbitrage
buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index finished 107.42 firmer at 19,270.85 after moving between 19,160.03
and 19,336.17. Traders said last week's rise in US equities had relieved
investors, who had been worried about an exodus of US funds from global
stock markets.
While position taking by institutions and dealers eroded some of the
morning's gains, late afternoon index-linked buying supported share prices.
Volume totalled 250m shares, against 230m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 5.71 to 1,514.31, while the Nikkei 300 put on 0.93 at
279.97. In spite of the gains in the indices, declines outnumbered advances
by 649 to 314, with 206 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
edged up 0.01 to 1,264.67.
Although the Nikkei 225 had bottomed out from last month's nine-month low,
some analysts believed that the stock market might face turmoil before the
end of the business year in March. 'Given modest economic prospects, an
aggressive monetary tightening could dampen expectations of economic growth
with negative implications for equities,' wrote Mr Keith Donaldson, a
strategist at Salomon Brothers, in a recent report.
Trading companies, steels and shipbuilders were actively dealt. Trading
house Mitsui was the most active issue of the day, slipping Y4 to Y829.
Nippon Steel moved forward Y4 to Y359 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
finished unchanged at Y728.
Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics maker, continued to rise on speculative
buying, closing Y25 higher at Y663.
Department stores gained ground amid hopes of an increase in sales during
the current winter gift giving season. Mitsukoshi, a leading retailer with
links to Harrods, moved ahead Y22 to Y1,020 and Tokyu Department Store
climbed Y26 to Y696.
Konica, the photo film maker, lost Y4 at Y796. It rose to a new high for the
year earlier in the day on technical buying, but profit-taking finally
depressed the stock after a four-day rising streak.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 96.60 to 20,926.94 in volume of 26.2m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, dropped Y70 to Y5,430. Individual investors
were apprehensive over a possible loss of market share, due to the recent
introduction of new electronic game hardware by Sony and Sega.
Roundup
Wall Street's performance last Friday lifted a number of the region's
markets.
TAIPEI closed sharply higher following Saturday's gains as institutions
increased positions on fundamentally strong industrials.
The weighted index strengthened 117.97 or 1.7 per cent to 7,055.30. Turnover
amounted to TDollars 118bn.
China Steel, the most active issue, rose by its daily 7 per cent limit to
TDollars 29.20. Textiles extended recent rises with Hualon jumping TDollars
1.90 or 5.7 per cent to TDollars 35.90.
The heavily weighted financial sector also rose to support the market: ICBC
surged TDollars 6 or 5.9 per cent to TDollars 110 and First Commercial Bank
was up TDollars 3 to TDollars 197. Some brokers attributed the rise in
financials, many of which have close government connections, to the ruling
Nationalist party's victory in recent local government elections.
SEOUL was lower for the fifth consecutive session on persistent worries
about tight liquidity, and the composite index shed 7.93 to 1,028.61 in thin
trade. Heavy selling of primary blue chips and institutional inactivity put
further pressure on the market.
Samsung Electronics and Korea Mobile Telecom went limit down, losing
Won3,000 and Won10,000 at Won114,900 and Won469,000 respectively. Posco also
hit its lower limit, falling Won2,000 to Won66,500.
SYDNEY saw light bargain hunting by local investors as the All Ordinaries
index gained 3.0 at 1,900.0, off an intraday high of 1,912.9. The futures
contract dipped 14 to 1,896. Turnover was ADollars 573m, boosted by
options-related trading.
Among leading stocks, BHP edged ahead 4 cents to ADollars 19.18. Mining
issues were generally firmer on bargain hunting after recent sharp falls:
WMC appreciated 19 cents to ADollars 7.39, MIM 7 cents to ADollars 2.19 and
RGC 5 cents to ADollars 4.65.
HONG KONG finished mildly firmer after retreating from its highs on active
profit-taking in the afternoon. The Hang Seng index was finally up 11.95 at
8,178.34, after an early high of 8,326.78 on the back of Friday's rally on
Wall Street.
Today's US FOMC meeting on interest rates also kept buyers on the sidelines,
brokers said.
Property issues fell the most, with Cheung Kong losing 20 cents at HKDollars
31.70 and Amoy Properties 15 cents at HKDollars 7.20.
The China-controlled container leasing company Florens Group made its debut
at a 55.5 cents or 19.3 per cent discount from its issue price, ending at
HKDollars 2.325 on its first day of trading.
BOMBAY fell prey to a threat by the opposition, right-wing Bharatiya Janata
party to launch a campaign to oust ministers named in a sugar import and a
securities scandal. The BSE 30-share index retreated 33.59 to 3,910.06.
SINGAPORE moved ahead on renewed demand for blue chip issues, mostly by
local funds. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 15.47 to 2,185.19, but
volume was thin at 61.7m shares.
Fraser &amp; Neave added 30 cents at SDollars 15.20 on slightly better than
expected full-year figures. Asia Pacific Breweries, a joint venture between
F &amp; N and Heineken, rose 13.6 per cent in late-day trading as retail
investors chased the stock for its one-for-one scrip issue. APB climbed
SDollars 2.10 to SDollars 17.50 but in thin volume.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher in response to Wall Street, but reluctance by
investors to accumulate stocks kept volumes low.
The composite index firmed 10.65 to 957.25, helped by a 70-cent rise to
MDollars 17.30 in Telekom Malaysia.
MANILA finished off its intraday peak as investors took profits after the
index leapt by 45 points in the first 30 minutes of trade.
The composite index closed 14.27 up at 2,723.26. Volume increased to 2.4bn
shares worth 2.13bn pesos.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Political worries push Italian lira to
record low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continuing political turmoil in Italy yesterday drove the lira to fresh lows
on the foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith.
The lira set a low of L1,047.90 against the D-Mark in European trading, but
the market was unable to sustain this move. It recovered to close in London
at L1,046.
Aside from the lira, where analysts anyway reported more talk than action,
it was a case of 'pre-Christmas' trading  - the euphemism for long lunches
and little business.
Insofar as traders were able to raise their heads from the Christmas
pudding, there was little incentive to trade ahead of today's meeting of the
Federal Open Markets Committee in Washington.
Expectations that the FOMC might sanction higher rates have receded
recently, but not disappeared.
Sterling traded in a very narrow range of about  1/2 pfennig against the
D-Mark, and 0.3 cents against the dollar. The trade weighted index stayed at
80.4 all day. The pound closed at DM2.4571, from DM2.4561, and at Dollars
1.5613 from Dollars 1.5630.
The dollar had a very quiet day ahead of the FOMC meeting, ending at
DM1.5738, from DM1.5714, and Y100.155 from Y100.15. It finished in New York
at DM1.5733 and Y100.13.
The catalyst for further lira weakness was the heightened efforts from the
Northern League, coalition partner of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime
minister, to topple the government in a no confidence vote later this week.
There is now a widespread expectation that the lira will weaken to L1,050
before it recovers. Although politics is the current focus, failure to
tackle structural problems in the budget, including rising debt servicing
costs, also provide economic reasons for currency weakness.
Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank in London, commented: 'Normally
at this stage of a political crisis in Italy you might look for the currency
to strengthen. People begin to emphasise positive elements of the new stage
that is about to begin.'
On this occasion, however, the problem lies in trying to assess the likely
shape, and efficacy, of any future coalition, should the government fall.
Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker GNI, said: 'It looks as if the foreign
exchanges have fully discounted this political chaos . . . lira bears may
find it better to travel than arrive as far as the confidence vote is
concerned.'
All eyes will be on the US Fed today. While some benign recent price data
have allowed markets to relax, there is still room for the Fed to take a
different view. This is based on evidence of strong credit growth, and
buoyant retail and auto sales.
Consumer credit outstanding rose by Dollars 11.6bn in October (up nearly 16
per cent, year on year) and has been rising without interruption for two
years.
Some observers have cited two other possible reasons why the Fed might stand
firm: the possibility that further tightening could, in the wake of the
Orange County episode, cause systemic municipal default; and that it might
precipitate a stock market crash.
These arguments are dismissed by Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at
Citibank in London, as 'far from compelling'. He said: 'It would be
imprudent to alter policy in order to bolster unsustainable bond market
positions.' He argued that the Fed might also welcome a stock market
reversal that had a dampening effect on the recovery.
Mr Cocker said the odds against a rate rise were probably 65:35. He added
that the Fed was in a difficult position. Although there were few signs of
inflation, economic growth was clearly buoyant.
Mr Mark Geddes, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, remarked:
'Given the November tightening in policy was the most aggressive since 1981,
plus the short period since the last FOMC meet, the US authorities are
likely to want more time to determine the effectiveness of the 250
basis-point tightening in rates so far this year.'
Mr Cocker said the dollar had limited downside if rates did not rise. Given
the prevailing positive sentiment, the market would simply reason that rates
would be increased at the next FOMC meeting.
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 550m shortage in its daily money market
operations, mostly through late assistance.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EIU says coffee may have peaked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World coffee prices have probably peaked, provided there are no further crop
surprises and the next Brazilian harvest turns out well above the gloomiest
forecasts, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
In its December outlook for food commodities, it predicts a 1995-96 crop of
17.5m bags, helped by the recent rains. This is 2.7m tonnes higher than the
highest estimate from the Brazilian government in early November.
The EIU sees the crop rising to 28m bags the following year. However, if
this recovery is threatened, for example, by further frosts next year,
prices could easily rise above Dollars 3 a pound, it says. This is because
stocks at the end of the 1994-95 season are likely to be at their lowest for
many years, especially in producing countries.
The EIU sees the differential between robusta and mild arabica prices
widening from about 17 per cent at present to average more than 20 per cent
next year. It says robusta supplies should recover sharply thanks to a
bumper crop expected in Indonesia in 1995-96 and big increases in the
harvests this season in Ivory Coast, Vietnam and Thailand.
After this year's sharp rise in sugar prices, the report predicts little
change next year, and a decline to about 11 cents a pound, from a 1994
average of 11.9 cents, in early 1996. This is because of a probable swing
from a third successive global deficit to a surplus of 1m tonnes in 1995-96.
On grains, it expects record maize and soyabean crops in the US this year to
push prices lower next year.
It says export prices of US maize will hit their long-term floor, averaging
about Dollars 9 a tonne less than in 1994 at Dollars 100 a tonne or just
below. The US maize crop of up to 260m tonnes will push carry-over stocks to
nearly 60m tonnes at the end of the season next August, compared with 22m
tonnes a year earlier, says the EIU. But a stock drawdown is likely to help
prices recover in the first half of 1996.
Soyabean oil is forecast to fall to Dollars 559 a tonne by the third quarter
of next year  - 8.5 per cent lower than the third quarter average for 1994
 -based on world oilseed output reaching more than 189m tonnes in 1994-95,
up nearly 11 per cent on the previous year.
Wheat prices are expected to range between Dollars 150 and Dollars 160 a
tonne until the middle of 1996, unless the US crop next year proves
insufficient to rebuild depleted global stocks. In that event, the EIU
predicts prices could go as high as Dollars 180 a tonne.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices rallied from their lows at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday but still ended with net losses, despite strong buying of
ALUMINIUM.
The cash premium in the COPPER market narrowed sharply as concern about
approaching options declarations eased.
An unsettled day at the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE market ended with
the March futures price up Dollars 10 at Dollars 2,648 a tonne, after
trading between Dollars 2,607 and Dollars 2,690. Talk of a new producers
retention scheme provided some support.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegians withdraw from gas
pipe project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, and Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest
publicly quoted company, have abruptly withdrawn from the proposed 440m
pipeline project to link the UK with the European natural gas grid.
The new pipeline, know as the interconnector, will allow large-scale gas
exports from the UK by the end of the decade.
The interconnector will be owned by British Gas, with 40 per cent, British
Petroleum, Elf Aquitaine, Gazprom of Russia and Conoco, each with 10 per
cent, and UK utility National Power, Ruhrgas of Germany, Distrgaz of Belgium
and Amerada Hess, each with 5 per cent.
Statoil and Norsk Hydro said they had made their participation in the
pipeline conditional on achieving a solution to a dispute between Norway and
Britain over a new Frigg gas pipeline treaty.
'However, the majority of the other companies involved in the scheme were
unwilling to accept this reservation. The dispute over the Frigg line
consequently has to find a political solution,' Statoil said.
The British government refuses to ratify the deal, valued at more than
NKr20bn (Pounds 1.87bn) and agreed in 1991 for Norway to supply National
Power with 30.8bn cubic metres of gas over 14 years through the Frigg
pipeline.
Norway says the British government made Norwegian companies' participation
in the interconnector conditional on clearing the way for new Norwegian gas
exports to the UK through the Frigg gas pipeline.
'We will wait for the British government to clarify its position on the
Frigg pipeline before deciding our next move on the treaty issue,' said Mr
Tore Sandvold, director-general at Norway's industry and energy ministry.
Norway and Britain have for several years been in dispute over the terms
governing transport of new Norwegian gas deliveries to the UK through the
Frigg pipeline.
Meanwhile, a planning application for the interconnector will be submitted
early next year, in time for construction to begin in the spring of 1996.
the pipeline is likely to be completed in the autumn of 1988. It will carry
20bn cubic metres of gas annually.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Kissing
goodbye to a Christmas tradition - The problems of British apple growers are
hitting supplies of home-grown mistletoe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the kissing have to stop? And if it does, will this be the result of a
machiavellian plot hatched by the European Union? Moreover, if every
red-blooded Brit observed rules established over generations might the
practice already be dying out? Not because of a punitive quota but simply
because of market forces.
I refer of course to the possibility of a crisis in the mistletoe business
and to the tradition that dictates one berry should be removed from each
sprig of the foliage for each kiss that takes place beneath it.
Fortunately such rules are regularly ignored and the season of goodwill
usually permits pursed lips to press against one another, according to
custom, an unlimited number of times without berries being removed. Which is
just as well, because were that not the case, I would be looking forward to
a very dull Christmas.
In the absence of any of the parasitic plants on our own apple trees, the
other day my wife bought a small sprig of mistletoe in our local Norfolk
town. It weighed between three and four ounces, complete with a dozen or so
berries, and it cost her Pounds 1. Indeed, she refused to buy any more at
such an extortionate price. Perhaps she was also trying to tell me
something.
But I had already established that at auction in Tenbury in Worcestershire
(or 'the orchard', as Queen Victoria is said to have dubbed the town), the
price was about 75p a pound last week. Somebody in the supply chain, which
admittedly stretches from the West Midlands to East Anglia seems to be
making a pretty good margin.
Because of the association of mistletoe with apple trees it can only get
dearer in the future.
Although it will grow on poplar and occasionally on oak trees, its favourite
'host' is the apple. It establishes itself on the trees as a result of the
beak-cleaning activities of songbirds, especially mistle thrushes. Having
fed in mistletoe berries (which are poisonous to some species) the birds
apparently, get seeds stuck in the crevices of their beaks  - like grape
pips between our teeth. Not having tooth picks readily to hand, the birds
scrape the seeds out of their beaks on to the rough bark of apple trees and
'plant' them where they grow. Mistletoe derives its nourishment from the sap
of the trees.
UK apple growers have had a rough time in recent years as fruit from other
countries has displaced indigenous varieties. French Golden Delicious have
been a particular problem, although one British apple grower suggested the
French should be hauled up before the courts under the Trades Description
Act for naming the variety delicious. They come in during our own season
and, being a very high yielding variety, cost much less to grow than best
British apples such as Cox.
The disappearance of almost half of Britain's apple trees since the country
joined the Common Market in 1973, is not the only cause of the mistletoe
shortage; nor will the grant-aided grubbing out of a further 13 per cent of
British orchards, as a result of a recent EU scheme to cut community
production and attempt to raise the price of apples to economic levels,
necessarily affect future supplies of mistletoe.
For the EU rules state that the apple orchards to be grubbed must be
composed of young trees, not more than 20 years old and capable of bearing a
full crop of fruit. They must also be planted at a density of not more than
160 trees an acre. In other words, the orchards that will go will be modern,
hedge-type plantings enabling easy picking from the ground.
But parasitic mistletoe is only allowed to grow on big old trees in
traditional orchards. Fifty-year-old or more cider and cooking apple trees
are much the best  - the ones not covered by the EU scheme. One of the
reasons for this is that most of those trees are uneconomic for fruit
production, on their last legs and almost ready to fall down in any case.
Many are only retained to provide shelter for sheep flocks that graze the
orchards and for the side-line cutting of mistletoe.
It may be, therefore, as these old trees disappear, that in future years,
sales of traditional winter greenery held at Tenbury market on the four
Tuesdays before Christmas each year will have fewer bunches of local
mistletoe mixed among the holly and Christmas trees. Indeed these annual
auctions have already begun to attract entries from northern France where
mistletoe is plentiful especially on the ubiquitous poplars.
But disparaging locals say the French stuff is not as good. For a start it
is usually a different, less attractive variety. But worse than this is the
way it is presented: dehydrated and squashed following the long journey
across the channel.
The French, you see, have no real appreciation of the plant nor of any
tradition of kissing under the mistletoe in spite of their racy reputation.
Only the British have revered mistletoe from the time of the ancient Druids
and today its magical and licentious powers are exclusively enjoyed in the
English-speaking world.
And when you think of it, kissing in France is only a series of ritual pecks
on the cheek  - perhaps because of the preponderence of garlic in the diet.
The British are the deliverers and recipients of full frontal smackers and
long may there be sufficient English mistletoe around to enable and enhance
that excellent Christmas tradition.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lonrho and Gencor go for gold
in the CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho, the London-based international trading combine, and Gencor, the
South African mining group, are setting up a joint company to develop gold
mines in the former Soviet Union. Mr Joe Platts-Mills, a Lonrho director,
said he expected the joint venture to identify within two years big reserves
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, probably as much as 2,000 tonnes
(64.3m troy ounces)
The 50-50 joint venture would draw on his group's contacts in the CIS -
developed over the past five years and not just in the mining sector - and
its ability to work in unusual places and Gencor's mining know-how,
including its Biox technology. This uses bacteria to break down refractory,
or difficult, ores to release the gold locked inside instead of employing
expensive heat and pressure vessels.
Mr Platts-Mills said it was the policy of the former Soviet Union to leave
refractory sulphide gold deposits untouched so the technology had a lot to
offer the CIS, including the ability to treat ore with a high arsenic
content and leave no harmful waste.
Mr Adrian Coates of Warrior International, which advised Gencor on the deal,
said the South African group concluded from visits to the CIS two years ago
that there were many ore bodies there that would lend themselves to the Biox
process. Gencor also believed it was several years ahead of its nearest
rival in bacterial gold recovery and needed to put this advantage to good
use.
The obvious partner was Lonrho, which via its 45-per-cent-owned associate
Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana was the largest commercial user of the
technology and was already well-established in the CIS. Lonrho's access to
the Biox technology was primarily responsible a year ago for it winning the
right to develop a big gold mine in Uzbekistan, with two Uzbek
government-owned companies.
Discussions are well advanced with the Uzbek State Committee on Geology for
the development of its Ingichki Research Establishment as a centre for the
testing ores to see if they are amenable to the Biox process.
Lonrho at present was engaged in 36 serious discussions about mining
ventures in Uzbekistan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kurdistan, said
Mr Platts Mills. Most of the contacts were in Russia but the republic had so
far not shown itself to be as open to doing deals as some of the central
Asian republics.

Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade, the US ice-cream company famous for its oddball
approach to business, yesterday surprised the stock market by warning that
it expected to turn in a net loss of between Dollars 700,000 and Dollars
900,000 in the quarter to December because of a downturn in sales.
Ben &amp; Jerry's shares, which traded at nearly Dollars 34 at the height of the
company's growth in 1992, plunged Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 10 after the
announce-ment.
The company said it had maintained its 42 per cent share of the super

exceptionally heavy promotional activity by companies in the premium sector.
As a result, the company's sales were down by 5 per cent.
In last year's fourth quarter Ben &amp; Jerry's made net profits of Dollars

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Toyota lifts forecast despite
yen's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toyota Motor, the leading Japanese carmaker, has revised upwards its profit
forecasts for the first half to December in spite of the yen's appreciation.
Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, said aggressive cost cutting would lift
unconsolidated operating and recurring profits, before extraordinary items
and tax, to 10 per cent above the original interim forecast.
Non-consolidated recurring profits for the interim period are now expected
to rise 74.3 per cent from the previous year to Y145bn (Dollars 1.44bn)
while operating profits are estimated to increase nine-fold to Y85bn.
The cost-cutting helped cover the Y30bn foreign exchange loss which had
arisen as a result of the company basing its initial forecasts on a
yen/dollar rate of Y103, against the actual Y98 through the July-December
period.
Mr Toyoda was confident about the company's domestic sales and overseas
manufacturing. He forecast that domestic sales in the year to next December
would climb 10 per cent from a year earlier to 2.24m vehicles, after falling
1 per cent this year to 2.04m.
Overseas production, which rose 19 per cent to 1.05m units this year, is
expected to increase by 18 per cent to 1.25m in 1995.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Traders await FOMC meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN and MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Treasury prices were mostly flat in quiet trading yesterday ahead of
today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at
96 1/32 yielding 7.839 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 3/8 , yielding 7.580 per cent.
There was some short-covering as traders prepared for the Fed's open market
committee meeting. For weeks the market has been up and down on speculation
about whether the Fed would raise rates.
In November the Fed finally convinced investors that it would hold the line
against inflation, which caused the yield spread between the two-year and
the 30-year bond to fall sharply as traders bet that the Fed might raise
rates in December. A flattening yield curve is interpreted as a signal that
the market expects economic slowing.
Over the past two weeks, many have reversed their bets about a December rate
increase  - and the yield spread widened modestly  - as mild inflation
numbers convinced many that the central bank might wait for the new year to
put rates up again.
Politics has also become a concern for the market recently, as Democrats and
Republicans try win the hearts of voters with tax-cutting plans.
UK government bonds rose slightly, and the December long gilt future moved
up  7/32 to around 102 3/8 in late trading. The yield spread over German
government bonds was around 115 in late trading.
Mr Andrew Roberts at UBS said trade was very thin, with investors unlikely
to place large orders before the new year. He said flows were likely to
remain very thin ahead of Christmas; however, support from domestic
investors was underpinning gilt prices.
German government bonds slipped, and the March bund futures contract on
Liffe fell by around 0.21 on the day to 89.70 in late trading. An analyst at
Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt said trading was likely to remain very slow in
the run-up to Christmas, but there was substantial support for bunds at the
89.70 level.
Italian government bonds fell, and the March bond futures contract on Liffe
moved to around 98.14 in late trading, a fall of 0.47. Mr Pio de Gregorio at
NatWest Markets said investors were worried about political events, but
these worries were obscuring the positive fundamentals.
He said: 'Inflation is trending down, but the worries of the political
developments and the public finances are very much the focus of investors'
attention. The lira looks extremely undervalued. It has an enormous risk
premium because of the political uncertainty.'

joint venture in the US.
Fisons' most important drug, asthma treatment Tilade, and RPR's Azmacort
will now no longer be sold by each others' sales teams.
Fisons said yesterday the change followed the transformation in the US
healthcare market, where individual doctors are being replaced as drug
buyers by health management organisations.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Fourth-term setback seen at
Chase Manhattan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan, the US bank, said it expected to report substantially lower
trading revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third, but this would be
partly offset by other revenue items, Reuter reports from New York.
Chase also said that other business areas, excluding trading, would report
fourth-quarter revenue trends that would be much the same as in the third
quarter.
Chase's trading revenues were Dollars 188m in the third quarter, Dollars
151m in the second, Dollars 179m in the first quarter, and Dollars 167m in
the 1993 fourth quarter.
Chase previously said it would take a Dollars 20m fourth-quarter
restructuring charge from buying the American Residential mortgage company
and that it would have Dollars 100m in pre-tax costs from a voluntary
retirement programme.
Chase said the Dollars 100m in fourth-quarter expenses would be offset by
other revenue items, such as the previously announced sale of Chase Florida,
resulting in a non-material impact on earnings.
Analysts generally expect the fourth quarter to be a poor quarter for
trading revenues at most banks because of difficult trading conditions,
particularly in bond mar-kets.
Last week, J. P. Morgan said it also expected 'substantially reduced'
trading revenues in the fourth quarter from the third quarter's Dollars
282m.
It also said that, mostly as a result of this, fourth-quarter earnings would
be lower than third-quarter earnings.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Dealers switch focus to euroyen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in the eurobond market yesterday was quiet in the run-up to
Christmas, with only a small number of deals in Europe and a Dollars 100m
floating-rate note signed in Asia by the Bank of Seoul.
Attention is now turning to the new year, when dealers expect the euroyen
market to provide most excitement. 'The bid for yen is still strong,' said
one syndicate manager.
He said that the two-tranche Y120bn six and 10-year offering launched last
week by the Republic of Austria had been extremely well-received by
investors. He expected 'that sort of demand to continue both on an
institutional basis and on a retail basis'.
'There are a lot of borrowers looking at the yen market  - such as Spain and
the EIB (European Investment Bank),' said another syndicate official. 'The
swap levels there are attractive, particularly when other markets are less
receptive,' he said.
The prospect of increased yen-issuance was boosted by comments made by a
Japanese Ministry of Finance official that Japan is considering either
easing or abolishing the 'lock-up' period for euroyen bonds issued by
non-sovereign foreign borrowers.
This move would help the distribution of eurobonds to investors in Japan.
However, the official told Reuters that no specific timetable had been set.
Restrictions on the purchase of euroyen bonds issued by sovereign borrowers
were abolished in January this year.
Dealers also expect to see greater activity in the eurodollar sector early
next year, particularly in the five-year area of the yield curve. 'We are
seeing consistent interest in the dollar sector, and recently there has been
a lot of switching out of three-year and into five-year bonds,' said one
trader.
Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, increased its DM750m five-year
offering launched last month to DM1bn, due to 'exceptional demand from
European retail and institutional investors,' joint lead manager Commerzbank
said.
Colombia's state Institute for Industrial Development is to issue a Dollars
100m eurobond in February 1995, via Citibank, a finance ministry official
told Reuters. The proceeds from the offering would be used to make long-term
loans to industrial companies, he said.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Moore reduces stake in
business-forms partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's Moore Corporation has taken a big step towards shifting its
emphasis from paper forms to more sophisticated information-handling systems
by selling the bulk of its stake in Toppan Moore, Japan's biggest
business-forms supplier.
Moore will receive Y34.4bn (Dollars 343m) from the sale of 35 per cent of
Toppan Moore to its Japanese partner, Toppan Printing. The deal, which will
be completed early next year, will raise Toppan's stake in the joint venture
to 90 per cent, leaving Moore with 10 per cent.
Toppan Moore has contributed an average of 10 cents a share over the past
three years to Moore's annual earnings, which totalled USDollars 82.2m, or
83 cents a share, in the first nine months of 1994.
Moore had planned to reduce its stake in Toppan Moore through a public share
offering in Japan, but that was expected to take up to two years. 'We have
got the same deal, dealing directly with Toppan,' Ms Shoba Khetrapal, Moore
treasurer, said yesterday.
Moore, which claims to be the world's largest supplier of business forms, is
undergoing a shake-up spearheaded by Mr Reto Braun, who took over as chief
executive in late 1993. The Toronto-based company unveiled a new business
plan earlier this year to keep abreast of the shift from paper to electronic
information sources.
It aims to concentrate on three businesses: forms and form-management
systems; labelling systems, including bar-codes; and customer
communications, such as direct mail.
The proceeds of the Toppan Moore sale will be used for acquisitions in these
fields, including further investments in Japan and other Asian countries.
Moore recently bought a 60 per cent stake in a new information-handling
systems joint venture in China. Its partner is Shanghai Jielong Industry
Corporation.
As part of its new strategy, Moore has also bought a 20 per cent stake in
JetForm, an Ottawa-based specialist in electronic forms technology, and has
formed an alliance with Datamax of Orlando, Florida, to develop a thermal
bar-code printer for linerless labels.
Mr Braun aims to expand revenues by 10 per cent a year for the next five
years, with more than half the growth coming from alliances and
acquisitions. Moore's sales totalled almost Dollars 1.8bn in the period
January-September 1994.

Ben &amp; Jerry, which donates 7.5 per cent of its pre-tax profits to charity,
has grown rapidly since its inception in 1978: it made net profits of
Dollars 7.2m on sales of Dollars 140.3m last year. But it has recently been
struggling to maintain its momentum.
Earlier this year Mr Ben Cohen, one of the founders, announced that he was
stepping aside as chief executive and invited applicants to send in essays
explaining in 100 words: 'Why I would be a great CEO for Ben &amp; Jerry's'. The
job has not yet been filled.
Yesterday Mr Chuck Lacy, chief operating officer, said the super premium
category had been sluggish this year because of 'unprecedented' promotional
activity in the premium sector.
In last year's fourth quarter Ben &amp; Jerry's made net profits of Dollars
1.1m.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mattel cuts 1,000 jobs, takes
Dollars 70m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mattel, the US toy manufacturer which outbid Hasbro in a battle for JW Spear
of the UK in July, yesterday announced that it was cutting 1,000 jobs from
its international workforce of 22,000 in an attempt to reduce costs and
increase profitability.
It said the cuts would produce a pre-tax restructuring charge of about
Dollars 70m in the year just ending.
However, the increase in efficiency would produce pre-tax savings of about
Dollars 25m next year and greater amounts thereafter.
In the year to December 1993, Mattel had net income of Dollars 117m on sales
of Dollars 2.7bn, but reported that the figure would have been Dollars 226m
were it not for the costs of absorbing Fisher-Price, a toy company it took
over at the end of 1993.
Yesterday, Mattel said it expected the current year's results from
operations to make 1994 the sixth consecutive year of record sales and
earnings.
It also announced a stock split and 25 per cent increase in the quarterly
dividend to 6 cents a share.
Mattel said the restructuring would involve the consolidation of
manufacturing operations and the reduction of headquarters expense and
support functions around the world.
It said the cuts in the workforce would take effect early next year.

<TEXT>
Coflexip, the French oilfield services company, yesterday completed a
Dollars 230m merger with Stena Offshore, the offshore contracting arm of
Stena of Sweden, writes David Lascelles. The two companies claimed the deal
would create Europe's largest offshore contracting company, and the world's
seventh largest by market capitalisation.
The merger was financed by issues of shares and convertible Coflexip stock
which, when fully exercised, will give Stena 32 per cent of Coflexip.
Coflexip is based in Paris and had sales of Dollars 379m and profits of
Dollars 33m in 1993. Stena Offshore specialises in sub-sea contracting in
the North Sea. Revenues in 1993 were Dollars 321m and operating profit
Dollars 34m. The combined company will be known as Coflexip/Stena Offshore.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Xerox agrees to sell reinsurance
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Xerox, the US document processing company, has agreed to sell a reinsurance
subsidiary for Dollars 400m, the largest disposal to date in the planned
break-up of its financial services businesses.
The company, Constitution Re, has been bought by Exor, a Luxembourg-listed
investment holding company controlled by the Italian Agnelli family.
Xerox early last year announced plans to sell off its financial services
businesses, with the exception of the financing operations which support
sales of its office equipment products.
The move echoes steps taken by several other big US non-financial companies
to leave the financial services business, which they had once seen as a
fast-growth industry in which to invest surplus profits.
Since announcing its plans, Xerox has sold Van Kampen Merritt, a fund
management firm, for Dollars 360m and Furman Selz, an investment bank, for
Dollars 90m. Constitution Re is the eighth-largest US-based reinsurer, with
net premiums last year of Dollars 454m, according to Xerox.
It writes reinsurance for a number of small US property and casualty
insurers, and takes on little catastrophe risk, according to Talegen,
Xerox's property and casualty insurance subsidiary.
The disposal, for cash, will leave Xerox a life insurance company and six
specialist property/casualty insurance businesses, which had premiums last
year of Dollars 2.4bn.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: US group buys Kraft Foodservice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, the US leveraged buy-out specialist, has agreed to
buy Kraft Foodservice, the second-biggest food service company in the US,
from Philip Morris, the US food and tobacco group.
The price was not disclosed, but is believed to be about Dollars 700m.
Kraft Foodservice is part of Kraft General Foods, Philip Morris's food
company. It distributes industrial-size packages of foods to restaurants,
hospitals and other non-retail outlets. Annual revenues are about Dollars
4bn.
The company distributes more than 160,000 products from different suppliers,
including Kraft General Foods. As part of the deal with Philip Morris, Kraft
Foodservice will remain the exclusive distributor of Kraft-branded food
service products to most customers for five years.
Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, a private investment firm, specialises in
acquiring divisions of big corporations and working with their managements
to improve returns. In the past year it has bought Wesco Distribution from
Westinghouse Electric, Remington Arms from Du Pont, and Allison Engine from
General Motors.
The firm seeks to increase the profitability of acquisitions by asking
managers to a take a stake in the business so that they have an incentive to
improve its performance. Kraft Foodservice's management is believed to be
participating in the Kraft transaction.
Under Philip Morris, Kraft Foodservice had been closely associated with Mr
Michael Miles, the former chairman and chief executive who resigned earlier
this year. He turned it into the biggest food service company in the US
after Sysco.
Mr Geoffrey Bible, the new chief executive of Philip Morris, is under
pressure to improve the company's performance, as its share price has been
battered by fears about possible consequences of anti-tobacco litigation.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Burlington increases offer for
Santa Fe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The stakes in the contested bid for the Santa Fe Pacific railway company
have been raised with an increased offer from Burlington Northern valuing
Santa Fe at Dollars 3.8bn in cash and shares.
The bid is a sharp increase on the offer from rival railway company Union
Pacific of about Dollars 3.2bn in cash and shares.
The merger aims to create the biggest railway group in the US.
Burlington and Santa Fe said they would both make cash tenders for Santa Fe
stock, amounting to about one-third of the equity, at Dollars 20 a share.
Thereafter Burlington would offer a stock swap for the remainder of Santa
Fe's equity.
While the cash element of the transaction would take place next month, the
stock swap would not take place until government approval of the merger.
The offer from Union Pacific, although lower, has the advantage of having
been provisionally cleared by the authorities. Its offer is allowed to
proceed immediately, with Santa Fe's shares being placed in an independent
trust pending official clearance.
Santa Fe also said its agreed deal with Burlington involved a poison pill
payment to Burlington of up to Dollars 60m if the agreement fell through.
Santa Fe said it would repay Dollars 400m of its outstanding debt.

Beneficial, the US financial services company, is to take a Dollars 38m
charge to cover potential losses at its German subsidiary, BFK Bank, as part
of the process of preparing the unit for sale.
BFK faces losses on a block of loans made to German consumers to finance the
purchase of camp sites. The German government is investigating charges that
the relationship between the consumers and the seller, the German financial
group Fundus Grundstuecks, was not as represented to BFK, according to
Beneficial.
Mr Finn Caspersen, Beneficial's chief executive, said he expected the charge
to cover any losses related to the campground loans.
'Our intention is to clear the deck and clarify BFK's financial situation
for potential sale,' he said. 'While this charge is a shame in that it ruins
our consolidated results for the fourth quarter, the essential fact remains
that our basic business in the US, Canada and the UK remains vibrant.'
He cited BFK's 'failure to achieve profitability up to the corporate
standard' as the main reason for the sale.
The German subsidiary, which provides consumer loans, currently has DM798m
(Dollars 508.3m) in accounts receivable.
Beneficial is pulling out of Germany just as another US company, GE Capital,
enters it. The financial services subsidiary of General Electric last week
took control of Service Bank, the finance arm of Kaufhof store group.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: German banks hope to shake off
the chill - Analysts see a recovery next year after 1994's bleak
performance, writes Andrew Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The snow is late in Germany this year, but winter arrived early for the
country's big banks. As the latest crop of results for the first 10 months
shows, 1994 has been a bleak year for their financial performance.
The most obvious damage has been caused by the decline in bond markets. This
ravaged profits on financial trading on the banks' own accounts, after a
bumper year in 1993. They have been only partly successful in compensating
for this with a better lending performance and with their ability in a fast
recovering economy to start making lower provisions for loan risks.
Analysts have downgraded their forecasts for the whole of 1994, looking
instead to improved results in 1995 as securities markets settle down and
banks benefit from the economic upturn.
This year, the bond market rout, caused by rising interest rates, has hit
them in two ways: through their own-account trading activities, with heavy
write-downs on bond holdings, and through a fall in commission business.
'It is very disappointing all round,' said Mr Peter Thorne, banking analyst
at Paribas Capital Markets in London. He said the German banks' weak results
could presage bad figures from banks elsewhere in Europe.
Dresdner Bank's explanation of its derivatives trading  - with a loss by its
Paris-based derivatives subsidiary on the trading account offset by a profit
on the interest income side  - raised questions about the way banks in
general dealt with this complex and controversial side of their business.
'The first question is how much else of a similar nature they are not
telling us about,' Mr Thorne said.
Mr Bryan Crossley, banking analyst at stockbrokers Hoare Govett in the UK,
agreed, seeing 'a certain amusement value' in the way Dresdner explained how
derivatives losses were matched by profits on linked securities.
Overall, Dresdner ended up with a 17 per cent decline in group operating
profits compared with falls of 15 per cent at Deutsche Bank and 27 per cent
at Commerzbank (although asset sales lifted its pre-tax result
considerably).
By far the best performers among the top listed banks in Germany were the
Bavarian banks. Bayerische Vereinsbank and Bayerische Hypo-Bank recorded
declines of only 2 per cent in operating profits for January-October against
the same period of 1993. But their financial trading profits suffered as
badly as those of their Frankfurt rivals.
The strength of their mortgage banking business, which showed through in a
strong interest income result, gave the two Munich-based banks extra
resilience. At Vereinsbank, new loan approvals for private housing were
about 10 per cent higher at nearly DM12bn (Dollars 7.6bn). But as Mr
Albrecht Schmidt, the bank's chairman, said, property lending has lost much
of its dynamism this year.
Across Germany, mortgage loan approvals have been falling sharply after the
earlier impetus provided by the rush to conclude deals before tax
concessions were reduced and by low real interest rates. Yet this is not the
only cause of concern over the two Munich banks. Analysts' eyebrows have
been raised by their rapidly rising labour and investment costs.
The banks say these reflect investments that will pay off later by providing
better service and advice to customers.
'Those who do not invest now will be punished by the competition,' said
Vereinsbank's Mr Schmidt. His bank is spending DM400m on information
technology this year, with total spending up 11 per cent, similar to that of
Hypo-Bank. By contrast, Deutsche Bank's expenses rose 6 per cent and
Commerzbank's 4 per cent.
With German banks feeling the competitive pressure as customers become more
particular about services and fees, there was much talk at the autumn press
conferences about direct banking, lower securities dealings costs and better
value all round. Public scepticism has been felt at the banks. As a result,
said Mr Schmidt, 'competition between the banks is more drastic than ever'.
Shareholders have been watching such trends with interest, especially in a
year when bank stocks have underperformed the market by about 16 per cent.
But next year's profits performance should be more satisfying.
'We expect the stock market to reward the improved profits outlook for the
banks in 1995 and 1996,' said Mr Thomas Radinger, Vereinsbank's banking
analyst.
The continued economic recovery should stimulate credit demand and further
lessen the need for new risk provisions, he added. For Deutsche Bank, he
expects a rise in earnings per share to DM59 next year and DM70 in 1996
after a decline in 1994 to DM50.5 from 1993's DM53. For Dresdner, he
forecasts DM23 in 1994 after DM28 last year, DM33 in 1995 and DM41 in 1996.
For two sets of shareholders, 1995 promises to bring a little extra.
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank celebrate their 125th anniversaries next year.
Although both are being coy about whether a bonus payment will be added to
the dividend, this is regarded as almost certain.
But Dresdner's shareholders will have to be patient. Their anniversary
pay-out is not due until 1997.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Goldman Sachs refinances part of
debt on Rockefeller Centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, yesterday agreed to refinance part of
the debt of Rockefeller Centre Properties in a move which could also give it
a large equity stake in the company.
Rockefeller Centre Properties is an investment company set up to own the
Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the landmark New York development, which is 80 per
cent owned by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan.
The Goldman Sachs move could leave it with an influential voice in any
future financial reorganisation of the mid-town office and retail
development.
RCP recently disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mitsubishi may fail to
meet interest payments on the mortgage, the next of which is due in
February.
Goldman and Whitehall Street Real Estate, a private investment vehicle
managed by the bank, have agreed to buy Dollars 225m of debt from RCP. It
has also been granted warrants and stock appreciation rights which, if
exercised fully, would give Goldman and Whitehall 19.9 per cent of the
shares in RCP.
However, the company's bye-laws may have to be amended before they could
take up this interest.
At present, they restrict any individual holding to a maximum of 9.8 per
cent.
RCP said the deal with Goldman refinanced debt which otherwise would have
fallen due next June.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Eni sees profit rising to more
than L2,500bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eni, Italy's state-owned chemicals and energy group, said yesterday it was
heading for a net consolidated profit of more than L2,500bn (Dollars 1.53bn)
for 1994.
The announcement was made to 100 top managers of Eni at a convention last
week, and is the latest in a series of optimistic statements intended to
smooth the way for partial privatisation of the group next year.
Eni said turnover would rise to L54,500bn for 1994, in spite of the
continuing programme of asset sales and winding-up of subsidiaries. The
group, still burdened by debt, returned to profit in 1993 when it made
L419bn after tax, on turnover of L53,900bn.
The Italian government has put the most profitable oil and gas divisions of
Eni on the list for privatisation during 1995, but the timetable is crowded
by other proposed sell-offs.
However, Eni said the group had 'the wind in its sails'. Its divestment
programme has raised some L4,100bn since September 1992, helping reduce debt
in 1994 by L3,000bn to L25,000bn. The quoted chemicals subsidiary, Enichem,
had returned to operating profit following an extensive restructuring.

<TEXT>
Ascom, the troubled Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has appointed
Mr Hans-Ulrich Schroeder as its chief executive. He is currently head of the
German unit of Alcatel, the French telecoms group.
Mr Schroeder, a Swiss, will replace Mr Fred Sutter, a long-serving Ascom
executive who stepped in a year ago when Mr Leonardo Vannotti was sacked.
The Swiss group, which has suffered two years of losses and business and
management upheavals, said it had returned to profit in 1994 while net debt
had been cut by one-third to about SFr600m (Dollars 451m) in the past 12
months.
Ascom is the product of a 1987 merger of three traditional protected
suppliers to the Swiss PTT. It has been struggling to develop a strategy to
cope with liberalised telecommunications markets.
In the wake of Mr Vannotti's departure and a 1993 loss of SFr336.7m, it was
suggested the group be broken up. But the directors approved restructuring,
recognising the customer base was too small to support a full range of
telecoms activities. Ascom has sold off and closed several activities, and
concentrates on three product lines: telephone sets and related systems,
corporate network systems, and coin- and card-operated telephones and
vending machines.
Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, is to acquire
Schubert &amp; Salzer Eisenguss, a Leipzig-based iron foundry that makes cast
iron components for heavy vehicles and construction machinery. The foundry
employs 300 and 1994 sales are expected to be DM65m (Dollars 41.4m).

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Serafino Ferruzzi on brink of
liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Creditors of Serafino Ferruzzi, the private holding company which once
controlled the Ferruzzi family's business empire, yesterday gave notice that
they intended to put the company into liquidation.
The move would finally cut the Ferruzzi family's financial ties with the
Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group, which came within hours of filing for
bankruptcy last year, brought to its knees by alleged corruption and
mismanagement.
Creditor banks yesterday told the Ravenna bankruptcy court which has been
hearing the case that they were intending to liquidate Serafino Ferruzzi.
The move was backed by Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted holding
company in which Serafino still has a 12 per cent stake.
Italian news agencies said the Ferruzzi family's representatives supported
liquidation, which requires formal approval by the regulatory authorities.
Shareholders would nominate a liquidator at a special assembly, probably
before the end of the year.
The trigger came at the weekend when Ferfin's directors reluctantly agreed
to renounce L326bn (Dollars 199m) owed to Ferfin by Serafino, and write off
a L100bn issue of Serafino bonds held by a related company.
In exchange, the family company will write off a L169.9bn Ferfin debt. Mr
Guido Rossi, Ferfin chairman, held out against such a solution until the
weekend when it became clear that otherwise Ferfin might have to repay the
debt to Serafino, without recovering what it was itself owed.
Ferfin said the net write-off would affect the group's 1994 accounts. Ferfin
was expected to record a net loss for the year. The company said that loss
would still be lower than in 1993, in spite of the unexpected increase in
extraordinary charges.
The 12 per cent stake in Ferfin is likely to be taken up by the banks, which
are the holding company's largest shareholders.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann seals Ricordi
takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bertelsmann, the German media and publishing group, is to merge Ricordi, one
of the oldest and best-known names in Italian music publishing, with BMG
Ariola, its Italian subsidiary. This completes the friendly takeover
launched in August.
The German group also announced yesterday that BMG Ricordi, as the new
company will be known, would seek strategic partners from the retailing
sector to help develop Ricordi's chain of music and book stores across
Italy.
The sum paid by Bertelsmann for a 74.3 per cent stake in Ricordi has never
been revealed, but the purchase this summer prompted a bout of patriotic
distress in Milan, where the publisher is based. The merged group will have
combined sales of more than L350bn (Dollars 214m) and just under 1,000
employees.
Established at the beginning of the last century, Ricordi is closely linked
with the world-famous opera house of La Scala.
In the second half of the 19th century, Ricordi's position as official
printer of some of Italy's best-known composers, such as Rossini, Bellini,
Donizetti and Verdi gave the publisher a virtual right of veto over the
choice of works for La Scala's operatic season. Since then it has
diversified into popular music.
Mr Arnold Bahlmann, senior vice-president of BMG International, which groups
Bertelsmann's music publishing interests, confirmed yesterday that the
German company had bought up the minority interests in Ricordi and owned 100
per cent of the parent company, G. Ricordi.
However, Mr Bahlmann reassured Italians that after the merger the artistic
heritage of Ricordi would be preserved through a separate subsidiary called
Casa Ricordi, which would group together the classical sheet music
activities of the publisher, and the collections of valuable manuscripts and
documents.
'Neither the composers, nor the manuscripts, nor the money are leaving
Italy, because we have invested a lot in the country and we want to earn it
back,' he said.
Apart from Casa Ricordi, BMG Ricordi will concentrate on four core areas  -
records, pop music publishing, video and multimedia  - which it hopes will
dovetail with Bertelsmann's international publishing and multimedia
ambitions.
Mr Bahlmann said the group wanted to realise the potential of the 22 Ricordi
shops in 15 Italian cities, four of which have been turned into multimedia
megastores.
He admitted the German group did not have retailing expertise, and was
seeking a partner. Negotiations have not begun, but the group had received
some expressions of interest.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ahold's US properties may be put
into investment fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ahold, the Dutch food retail group which operates six supermarket chains in
the US, may hive off some of its US properties into a property investment
fund.
A decision on the fund, which would be opened to participation from
institutional rather than private investors, is expected in early 1995.
The company is discussing the idea with Dutch institutional investors.
Ahold declined to say how much money it hoped to raise through the
investment fund. However, it said it was not likely to seek a listing for
the fund.
The company operates 600 supermarkets in the eastern US, making it one of
the 10 largest food retailers in the country. Some of these properties are
owned outright, while others are leased.
A study into a US property fund got under way several weeks ago, in response
to keen interest among Dutch institutional investors for new property funds,
particularly in the US.
Ahold said it was too early to say how many of the properties on which its
US supermarkets are located might be transfered to the fund.
It would not comment on a report in the Dutch property trade magazine Vast
Goed Markt which said the fund would start with assets of Dollars 100m
divided over 10 supermarket properties.
The company's 600 US stores are in six regional chains from South Carolina
to New England. The US supermarkets generate about half of Ahold's annual
turnover.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Coflexip merges with Stena unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coflexip, the French oilfield services company, yesterday completed a
Dollars 230m merger with Stena Offshore, the offshore contracting arm of
Stena of Sweden.
The two companies claimed the deal would create Europe's largest offshore
contracting company, and the world's seventh largest by market
capitalisation.
The merger was financed by issues of shares and convertible Coflexip stock
which, when fully exercised, will give Stena 32 per cent of Coflexip.
Coflexip, which specialises in flexible sub-sea pipework, is based in Paris
and had sales of Dollars 379m and profits of Dollars 33m in 1993. About 40
per cent of its business is in the North Sea. It also has facilities in
Australia, Brazil, Singapore and the US.
Stena Offshore specialises in sub-sea contracting in the North Sea. Revenues
in 1993 were Dollars 321m and operating profit Dollars 34m. The company has
its headquarters in Aberdeen, Scotland, and employs 1,600.
Mr Derek Leach, vice-president of marine and north sea operations for the
combined group, said the merger reflected the changing conditions of the
offshore contracting market, where weak oil prices were putting pressure on
exploration and forcing companies to cut costs.
Increasingly, he said, oil companies wanted contractors who could provide
complete solutions for offshore work.
In addition, the declining size of new finds in the North Sea meant more
wells were serviced by seabed technology rather than platforms. 'This is a
market niche where both companies are market leaders,' he said.
The combined company will be known as Coflexip/Stena Offshore.

FT  20 DEC 94 / International Company News: Arcon boardroom dispute settled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The boardroom upheaval at Arcon International Resources, the Irish company
in which Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz Foods, has a 23 per cent stake,
has been settled with 'an amicable and confidential agreement' and the
immediate resignation of four directors.
All four have been associated with the company since it was founded as
Conroy International.
They are Mr Richard Conroy, former chairman and chief executive; his brother
Mr Desmond Conroy; Miss Maureen Jones, director responsible for
administration and management; and Mr James Jones, director responsible for
finance.
Arcon issued an agreed statement saying they would 'pursue other business
interests'.
The boardroom split came into the open in October when Mr Richard Conroy,
Miss Jones and Mr Jones, resigned their executive roles claiming that, in
their opinion, Arcon had 'unilaterally and wrongfully repudiated their
contracts'.
Mr Brendan Gilmore, one of Mr O'Reilly's close confidants, was immediately
appointed chairman and chief executive.
Arcon is preparing to start a Dollars 65m lead-zinc mine at Galmoy in County
Kilkenny, Ireland's first new base metals mine for 20 years.
With his associates, Mr O'Reilly controls 29.9 per cent of the company while
Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish resources group, owns 21.6 per cent.
Mr Richard Conroy, with associates and family, owns about 5 per cent. He set
up Conroy, an investment company, two years ago. Among other interests, it
has large mineral claims in Finland where it is looking for gold and
diamonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Danisco, Europe's fourth largest sugar producer, lifted pre-tax profits in
the half-year to October 31 by 25 per cent to DKr568m (Dollars 92m) from
DKr453m, better than the company had predicted.
The group forecast a rise in profits of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent
for the full year, an upward adjustment of earlier forecasts.
Group sales increased 10.5 per cent to DKr7bn from DKr6.33bn.
The group has interests in sugar, distilling, snacks, frozen pea production,
food ingredients and packaging. All did better than last year, according to
the interim report.
Food and beverages sales increased to DKr4.2bn from DKr4.07bn and operating
profits rose to DKr504m from DKr394m. Sugar sales were strong in the first
half, but are expected to dip in the second half because the beet harvest
was below normal.
The group said Sweden's decision to join the EU would have a positive impact
on results. Danisco acquired Socker Bolaget, the Swedish monopoly sugar
producer, two years ago and is in a position to consider structural changes
in the Swedish industry, the interim report said.
In Germany, rationalisation at factories in eastern Germany has been
completed.
Danisco's EU sugar quota in Denmark is 425,000 tonnes. The group said
production would exceed this but would not reach last year's 521,000 tonnes.
In Germany, the quota was 126,000 tonnes, but production this year would not
be more than 105,000 tonnes. In Sweden, production this year is expected to
be about 330,000 tonnes, about 50,000 tonnes less than in 1993-94.
Grindsted Products, the food ingredients company, which produces enzymes for
food processing, increased sales to DKr1.10bn from DKr999m and operating
profits to DKr165m from DKr152m.
The packaging division increased sales to DKr1.72bn from DKr1.27bn.

The interim dividend goes up to 0.5p (0.4p), payable from earnings of 1.66p
(1.86p) per share. This was on capital increased by the placing and open
offer in the summer.

Halkin Holdings, the branded products group headed by Mr Howard Hodgson, the
former funerals entrepreneur, is selling T Hoskins, its brewery operation,
to its management.
The business, described by Mr Hodgson as 'non-core' is being sold for about
Pounds 1.7m  - Pounds 500,000 above book value  - to Tom Hoskins Brewery, a
company formed by existing management with the backing of a group of private
investors.
The deal, conditional on shareholders' approval, comprises Pounds 1.21m
cash, payable on completion; Halkin will also subscribe for 500,000 50p
convertible preference shares in Tom Hoskins at a premium of 50p.
Mr Hodgson said the disposal should have a minimal impact on the group's
trading performance. 'I intend to recommend a dividend in respect of the
full year,' he added.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown acquires Allied Domecq's UK
biscuit arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings has bought Lyons Biscuits, the UK biscuit business of
Allied Domecq, the spirits group which is shedding its food, tea and coffee
operations.
Best known for its Maryland chocolate chip biscuits, Lyons also makes a
range of biscuits for the own-label market. It employs 780 people in
Blackpool and is profitable on sales of Pounds 44m a year.
Hillsdown is thought to have paid just over Pounds 20m for the company,
which it will merge with its Premier Biscuits division. Together, the two
niche producers will have about 4 per cent of the UK biscuit market.
Premier, a management buy-out from Cadbury Schweppes in 1987, was bought by
Hillsdown in 1989. Its sales are believed to be about Pounds 150m.
Tetley tea and Allied's baking business are the last two large groups of
assets Allied Domecq still has on the block. With earlier disposals such as
DCA Food Industries, it appears to be on track to raise a total of about
Pounds 800m.
Nestle of Switzerland and Tata of India were among the companies that looked
at Tetley, the first or second largest producer in the UK, many continental
European countries, the US and Canada.
Nestle is thought to have balked at Allied Domecq's asking price, while a
purchase by Tata would present the Indian company with some complex
financing problems.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wills Group's shares rise prompts takeover
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in the volume of shares traded in Wills Group resulted in an
announcement that it is considering the possibility of recommending a
takeover offer.
The distributor and manufacturer of fluid handling parts said yesterday that
it was 'considering a range of strategic alternatives' but declined to give
details.
Despite reporting record annual profits, the company's share price has
declined from a high of 30p in mid-February to a low for the year of 13 1/2
p last Wednesday.
However, heavy trading pushed the price to 15p by Friday's close and
yesterday it rose further to 17 3/4 p.
Mr David Massie, chairman and the largest shareholder with a 15 per cent
stake, declined to say whether or not the company had received any specific
approaches. But he complained that 'the market value is out of kilter with
the steady progress the company has made'.
Analysts said possible bidders might come from one of the company's US
partners who want a distribution base in Europe, or from another UK
distributor looking to expand.
Wills has made a series of acquisitions over the past year to extend the
range of its activities, including a move into manufacturing. It has
holdings in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
Pre-tax profits for the year to July 2 almost doubled from Pounds 1.56m to
Pounds 2.96m on turnover of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 19.3m). Turnover for the
present year is forecast to be in excess of Pounds 50m.

The launch of new products and the general strength of global stock markets
helped Aberdeen Trust, the fund management and accountancy services group,
hoist pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 5.04m for the year to
September 30.
The improved result  - which was struck after writing off goodwill of Pounds
1.5m  - was further reflected in a Pounds 3.8m cut in net borrowings which
left gearing at 23 per cent (45 per cent).
Turnover rose to Pounds 17.7m (Pounds 14.8m). Earnings per share climbed to
4.01p (2.46p) while the final dividend is 1.4p for a total of 2p (1.5p).

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: East Midlands' Pounds 86m beats City
forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in East Midlands Electricity rose by 5 per cent after the group
announced substantially better than expected interim results and a
surprisingly large dividend increase.
East Midlands, the last of the 12 regional electricity companies to report,
was the strongest mover in a sector already buoyed by the Trafalgar House
bid for Northern Electric. The shares rose 41p to close at 851p.
Analysts said the profits, which rose from Pounds 64m to Pounds 86m pre-tax
for the six months to September 30, were some Pounds 13m ahead of average
expectations. Sales fell from Pounds 666.2m to Pounds 619.3m.
The dividend increase of 26 per cent to 8.6p compared with expectations of
8.2p and follows the special 85p pay-out announced in October. 'Having paid
such a big special dividend, East Midlands might have had more reason than
most to be less generous with the pay-out,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins of Hoare
Govett.
Mr Norman Askew, chief executive, pointed out that following the recent
share consolidation, the underlying increase in the dividend was slightly
more than 12 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 37 per cent to 30.2p
(22p).
He said the group remained determined to return value to shareholders. The
demerger of the National Grid, in which East Midlands holds an 8.4 per cent
stake, would be the next opportunity to release substantial value, he said.
The market expects this would mean a second special pay-out.
Mr Askew said the profits improvement had been achieved by squeezing more
profit from the regulated business and eliminating losses in the
non-regulated operations.
The pre-tax line was also helped by a Pounds 3.9m reduction in interest
charges to Pounds 4.5m.
Supply showed a 20 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 7.9m on
sales of Pounds 521m (Pounds 558m). Distribution lifted profits 10 per cent
to Pounds 78.2m on sales of Pounds 183m (Pounds 177m).
On the non-regulated side, operating losses in the contracting division fell
from Pounds 1m to Pounds 400,000. However, retailing remained difficult.
East Midlands share of the losses incurred in the retailing joint venture
was Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.6m).
Analysts are forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 215m for the full year,
with a dividend total about 18 per cent up at 30.5p.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Standard Life expands health side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, is to inject a further
Pounds 10m into Prime Health, its health insurance subsidiary, to help its
expansion in the intermediary market.
The move is expected to be announced later this week.
While the sum is small in terms of Standard Life, it represents two thirds
of Prime Health's existing working capital of about Pounds 15m.
At the same time, Standard is said to have revised slightly downwards the
new business figures it set for Prime.
It is thought to have set the target to rise from about Pounds 15m this year
to about Pounds 20m next year, but this has now been shaded back to nearer
Pounds 18m.
Even though there is no doubt that Standard is right behind the health
insurer, some large intermediaries are said to have wanted to see more
capital in the subsidiary itself before being prepared to do business with
it.
Standard announced in June that it was buying Prime from Municipal Mutual,
the local authority-owned insurance company, for an undisclosed amount.
Last year, Prime's gross premium income was Pounds 54m  - making it the
fifth largest health insurer in the UK. Its policies cover about 50,000
people. However, it suffered a slight hiccup last month with the departure
of one of its two regional sales mana-gers.
The acquisition was Standard's first move outside life and pensions
policies. Though the scale of the venture is small at present, health
insurance is expected to be a fast-growing part of the market.
Next year, Standard faces both the loss of its relationship with Halifax
Building Society, in which the UK's largest mortgage lender sold only
Standard Life financial services, and increasing competition for sales
through independent financial advisers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMI, the engineering group, is selling the completed first phase of its
Holford industrial and warehousing estate in Birmingham to Rodamco, the
Dutch group, for Pounds 25m.
The Holford estate is on land owned by IMI near Spaghetti Junction on the M6
motorway. It has been producing rental income of Pounds 2.5m a year and was
valued in the last accounts at Pounds 23m.
IMI has extensive holdings of land which are no longer required for group
operations. 'The Holford estate has never been a core part of IMI,' said Mr
Alan Emson, finance director. 'The market place for this type of development
has improved.'
There has been a steady demand for distribution properties on sites near
motorway junctions in the Midlands and numerous projects have emerged to
compete with established developments like Holford.
The phase being sold to Rodamco cost Pounds 16.5m to develop. Phase two of
the estate thus far involves just one building  - an office block for
Birmingham Cable.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Friends Provident acquires LCH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Capital Holdings, the property company owned by Citibank which
withdrew plans for a stock market flotation in May, has been bought by
Friends Provident, the mutual life insurance company.
Friends Provident will merge its Pounds 100m central London property
portfolio with LCH's Pounds 240m assets. The new company will be owned 78
per cent by the life insurer and 22 per cent by Citibank.
In addition, loans made to LCH by Citibank will be refinanced by Friends
Provident, which is effectively buying the assets at a modest discount to
market value.
Mr Nigel Kempner and Mr Stephen Musgrave, joint managing directors of LCH,
have resigned from the company.
LCH was formed from the remnants of Randsworth Trust, which was taken
private in 1989 at the peak of the market, but subsequently had to be
rescued by Citibank.
Its portfolio includes a number of well-known buildings in London's west
end, including the St Christopher's Place Estate near Oxford Street.
LCH's planned flotation was pulled at the last minute because Citibank was
not prepared to accept the price at which advisers said the shares would
have to be sold.
Mr Jeffrey Heintz, managing director at Citibank, said the bank had achieved
more attractive terms from Friends Provident than could have been achieve
through a flotation.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Margins under pressure as Brasway rises 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brasway, the West Midlands hose and fittings, lubricants and property group,
lifted pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the six months to October 29.
However, Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said there was pressure on margins and
further action to cut costs would be taken in the second half.
Profits were Pounds 505,000 (Pounds 420,000) giving earnings per share of
0.43p, against 0.36p, and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.24p. A
total of 0.53p was paid in 1993-94.
Turnover rose to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 15.3m) but the performance of its
divisions was uneven.
At Europower, the hose and fittings business, the order intake has been
strong. As a market leader, Brasway has been able to impose price rises to
ease margin pressure. But it is still seeking productivity improvement
through rationalisation at its Whitby and Market Weighton plants.
At Excelube, the lubricants company which was responsible for a large part
of Brasway's improved 1993-94 profits, business was sluggish in the first
quarter, although better in the second. But margins have been squeezed and
the company is too small to do more than follow the price lead of the oil
majors.
Property rents provided the biggest element  - Pounds 252,000  - of the
pre-tax profits.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Premier Cons confirms talks over Pict stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bid battle among Britain's independent oil exploration companies was
signalled yesterday when Premier Consolidated Oilfields confirmed it was in
discussions to buy a 48.3 per cent stake in Pict Petroleum, as part of a
Pounds 80m full offer for its smaller rival.
Premier is negotiating with Amerada Hess, the US oil and gas exploration
group, to buy the shares it has held since 1987. As part of a possible deal,
Amerada would trade its holding for a stake in Premier and subscribe for
further shares to a maximum of 25 per cent.
Last night, Mr John Lander, Pict managing director, said: 'We have been
notified by Amerada Hess of their discussions with Premier, but as such we
have not had any approach.' He refused to comment further on any
ramifications of an offer from Premier.
Premier said that any offer would be made on the basis of the group's
relative share prices at the close of trading last Friday. Pict shares were
then 141p, while Premier stood at 21 1/2 p.
Premier added: 'Any offer for Pict is unlikely to value the company at a
significant premium to that price.'
Yesterday, Pict shares closed 14p up at 155p, valuing the company at Pounds
80m, while Premier shares finished 1 1/2 p up at 23p.
Analysts said that at this level of valuation, an all-paper offer would
probably involve about seven Premier shares for every one Pict, giving
Amerada a stake of about 24 per cent in Premier. In the event of an offer,
the US group would pay 30p a share to increase its stake to the 25 per cent
ceiling.
Mr Iain Reid, oil analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'At this price, this deal
does not reflect the upside in Pict's drilling programme. We feel a more
appropriate offer should be nearer the Pounds 2 a share level.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney in bid for Bletchley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Sidney, the Mercedes-Benz truck and car dealer, has made a
recommended all-share offer for Bletchley Motor Group, which has 19 volume
car dealerships, in a deal which values the latter at about Pounds 16m, or
260p a share.
BMG's shares fell 5p to 260p and Charles Sidney's were unchanged at 90p.
Charles Sidney has received irrevocable undertakings from Mr David Dunn, BMG
chairman and chief executive, and the other BMG directors to accept the
offer. They speak for 1.44m shares, or 23.5 per cent of the issued capital.
Under the terms, existing Charles Sidney shareholders will hold 57.1 per
cent of the enlarged group, and BMG shareholders 42.9 per cent. Charles
Sidney is offering 2.8938 new shares for every BMG share. Full acceptance
will entail the issue of up to about 17.8m new shares. BMG shareholders will
also receive a special 2p dividend.
Mr Raymond Edwards, Charles Sidney chairman, said: 'There is no geographical
clash and there is no manufacturer clash.' Charles Sidney has dealerships in
Yorkshire and Scotland and sells Mercedes-Benz vehicles. BMG is based in the
northern home counties and its dealerships include Vauxhall, Rover, Toyota,
Fiat, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda and Ford.
Mr Edwards said the manufacturers, far from seeing problems in the merger,
saw it as positive.
He added that there were opportunities for cross-selling  - in that BMG's
rental fleets are small and do not include commercial vehicles  - and that
the contract hire and rental divisions of both groups would be brought under
one management.
In the year to August 31, the ungeared Charles Sidney made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 2.87m (Pounds 2.46m) on turnover of Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 55.8m).
In the six months to June 30, BMG made profits of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds
800,000) pre-tax on turnover of Pounds 52.7m (Pounds 39.6m).

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Baird expands clothing side with Pounds
11.5m buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
William Baird, one of the leading suppliers to Marks and Spencer, yesterday
announced the acquisition of Morris Cohen, a privately-owned lingerie and
nightwear manufacturer which also supplies M&amp;S, for Pounds 11.5m.
The purchase will be financed by the issue of 2m ordinary shares at a price
of 215p, plus Pounds 4.4m in loan notes and Pounds 2.8m cash.
The move is part of Baird's plan to withdraw from the engineering sector and
concentrate on its core clothing and textiles business. Last year it
acquired Richard I Racke, a maker of women's wear and casual clothing for
M&amp;S.
Cohen's forecast turnover for 1994 is Pounds 32m. Baird's contract clothing
operations had sales of Pounds 230m last year, most of which came from M&amp;S.
The target's production units, located in south Wales, will be merged with
Baird's existing contract lingerie operations nearby which will reduce
operating costs and management time.
'It's a perfect business for us in terms of its product, location and
customer,' said Mr Donald Parr, Baird's chairman.
Cohen's net assets are about Pounds 6.5m, before a dividend of Pounds 2m to
be paid to the vendors.

Mr Philip Green, former head of Amber Day (now WEW) and present chairman of
discount chain Xceptions, is going into department store retailing with the
purchase of Owen Owen for an undisclosed sum.
Together with Mr David Thompson, WEW's former finance director, he has
acquired the 13-store group from SPP-LET International.
Owen Owen's turnover last year was Pounds 175m, and although it made a loss
of about Pounds 2m, Mr Green said he believed it could be made profitable by
sharing distribution and administration costs with Xceptions.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MCIT calls for Pounds 70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival of leveraged buy-outs in the US has led Mezzanine Capital &amp;
Income Trust 2001, the UK mezzanine finance trust, to seek up to Pounds 70m
in new equity.
The trust, to be renamed MCIT, had net assets of Pounds 66m at the end of
the third quarter, and the new issue effectively doubles its size.
MCIT proposes to raise up to Pounds 70m before expenses by way of a placing
and open offer of up to 70m S income shares at 65p each and 70m S capital
shares at 35p apiece.
The shares may be subscribed for in the form of package units comprising one
share of each class with an issue price per package unit of 100p.
Of the issue, shares to the value of Pounds 62.5m are being placed and
shares worth a further Pounds 7.5m are subject to an open offer to
shareholders.
Non-binding indications of interest in the placing have been received from
institutions, including existing shareholders, for Pounds 62.5m.
The issue is sponsored by Hambros Bank and distributed by SG Warburg.
MCIT is raising money on the back of a record of returns to investors that
put it up close to the top of league tables of investment trust performance.
Net assets have grown from Pounds 29m to Pounds 66m since the company's
launch in 1986, giving a total return on net assets of 19 per cent a year.
MCIT has invested in small ventures ranging from the Great American Cookie
Company to the Fannie May Candy Corporation.
But MCI has found itself almost fully invested and unwilling to incur
substantial debts. The trust has moved to expand its equity in response to
an increase in proposals from Jordan/Zalaznick Advisers, its US investment
adviser.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bridging the credibility gap - Chris Tighe
considers the implications for the regional economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This morning, the chairman and chief executive of Trafalgar House, the
engineering and property conglomerate bidding for Northern Electric, will
pose for photographs beside the Tyne Bridge.
In choosing this backdrop, the most evocative and immediately recognisable
symbol of Tyneside, Trafalgar is acknowledging the importance of regional
identity in its fight to buy the north-east of England's regional
electricity company.
Trafalgar's choice of photo location is a bold attempt to emphasise its
local links. In 1982 it took over Dorman Long, builder of the Tyne Bridge,
and it now owns 14 companies in the region. These include Cleveland
Structural Engineering, successor to the company which built two of the
Tyne's other big bridges.
Local control is an important issue in a region pre-occupied by the problems
of high unemployment, being geographically peripheral, the paucity of
locally-based quoted companies and the need to maintain quality jobs for its
university graduates.
'This isn't about Trafalgar House, it's about the loss of control of a
regional company,' said Mr Doug Henderson, Labour MP for Newcastle North. He
wrote yesterday to the Office of Fair Trading, urging an investigation.
Mr Henderson is worried that the bid could trigger rapid concentration of
rec ownership, reducing competitiveness and technological edge. It could
also cost the region much needed jobs, especially if the rec's headquarters
lost decision-making autonomy.
North-east England has only 24 plcs with local headquarters, of which
Northern Electric is the largest. Despite some new listings this year, this
figure has remained fairly static. 'It's sad that as soon as we tend to get
them, a lot get taken over,' said analyst Mr John Dickinson, a director of
stockbrokers Wise Speke, based round the corner from Northern's Newcastle
headquarters.
Yesterday, Mr Arthur Foord, the Confederation of British Industry's northern
region director, while stressing that he was not criticising Trafalgar,
expressed concern at the loss of headquarters from the region.
'It's important that management expertise at the senior level is held within
the region because that influences investment in plants.'
Newcastle-based Mr Mike Darrington, managing director of Greggs plc,
Britain's biggest bakery chain, shares Mr Foord's apprehensions. 'I don't
like seeing businesses based in the north disappearing. I don't think it's
good for the north, the power is moving away.'
Mr Darrington, whose company spends Pounds 4m a year on electricity from a
number of recs, including Northern, added: 'As a customer I can't see any
advantage to our business.' He is concerned about investment plans under
Trafalgar and the possible loss of competition between recs.
Emerging into the December chill from the showroom attached to Northern
Electric's headquarters  - a showroom adorned with 'Buy now, pay 1995'
posters  - fireman Mr Ken Gurling voiced similar concerns. 'Trafalgar House
have their fingers in so many pies. 'Electric companies should be electric
compan-ies.'
Mr Gurling and others questioned outside the showroom were unimpressed with
Trafalgar's offer of Pounds 20 off their first electricity bill after the
takeover. Loyalty to Northern was coupled with some opposition to the
privatisation of the electricity industry.
Some feared further job losses. 'I've had dealings with Trafalgar House;
they're commercial, profit orientated. There would be job cuts,' said
interior designer Mr Richard Rycroft. The Pounds 20 was, he said, a
'sweetener'.
Labour's chief whip, Mr Derek Foster, was blunter still, calling it the
'bribe of the century' offered in an attempt to 'hijack' one of the north's
leading companies. Sale of the National Grid shares, added Mr Foster, could
bring Pounds 325m into Northern's coffers.
Unions representing Northern's 4,000 employees are committed to fighting the
bid. 'The board is saying they also wish to retain independence, but our
concern is that money talks,' said Mr Dave Harrison, chairman of the joint
unions.
Although the unions have been critical of Northern's plans, still under
negotiation, to shed 800 jobs, they would prefer, he said, to see the
company retain its independence. 'It's a case of better the devil you know.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: McAlpine close to Pounds 45m deal on quarry
products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alfred McAlpine, the housebuilding and construction group, yesterday said it
was in discussions to sell part of its quarry products business.
The deal, which will raise between Pounds 45m and Pounds 50m, will be signed
with George Wimpey some time in January.
McAlpine said it had received an offer for the three regions of its quarry
products business, covering the Midlands and south Wales, north Wales and
Scotland. These accounted for turnover of about Pounds 30m and operating
profits of Pounds 1.2m in the year to June 30 1993. It has net assets of
Pounds 37m.
Wimpey is thought to have beaten rival offers from Tarmac and Redland.
Nineteen quarries are to be sold, dealing predominantly in sand, gravel and
slate.
The company signalled it was considering its position in the quarrying
products business at its year-end in February. It said then: 'The fortunes
of the quarry products business continue to be closely related to the level
of demand from downstream construction activities which remained relatively
subdued.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Banks agree three day extension for
Stanhope
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope yesterday won a three-day breathing space as banks agreed to extend
the property developer's borrowing facilities until Thursday.
The company's Pounds 140m loans were due for repayment at 3.30pm yesterday.
All 16 banks in its lending syndicate agreed to an extension early in the
afternoon and a terse Stock Exchange announcement was issued just minutes
before the deadline.
Stanhope, headed by Mr Stuart Lipton, will use the breathing space to answer
detailed questions from the banks relating to refinancing proposals received
last week.
If it can satisfy the banks, led by Barclays and advised by Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, a three month extension of the borrowing facility could follow.
This would give Stanhope sufficient time to put one of the rescue packages
into practice.
However, sources close to the negotiations said that some banks still needed
to be finally convinced that refinancing would be a better option than
receivership.
The main refinancing plans come from British Land, the property investment
company headed by Mr John Ritblat, and Postel, the post office and
telecommunications pension fund. The Postel plan envisages a rights issue of
up to Pounds 250m, underwritten by the pension fund and other institutional
investors.
Stanhope could then partially repay its banks and buy the 50 per cent it
does not already own of Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the
Broadgate and Ludgate office developments in the City of London. The other
half of Broadgate Properties is owned by Rosehaugh, Stanhope's former
development partner which went into receivership in 1991.
British Land has offered the banks a cash-and-paper deal for Stanhope's
existing half share in Broadgate Properties.
While both proposals were revised late last week to offer better terms to
Stanhope's lenders, the banks would have to write off up to 20p in the pound
on their loans.
Stanhope has also asked the banks to consider a debt standstill of up to
three years, at the end of which they would receive full repayment.
The company believes it has found an investor willing to provide working
capital during a standstill period in return for an equity stake.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Bidder opts for derivatives contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House is planning to offset a large part of the expenses related
to the offer for Northern Electric by entering into a derivatives contract
with Swiss Bank, its financial adviser.
In return for an undisclosed fee, Trafalgar will benefit from any rise in
the share price of Northern Electric and several other regional electricity
companies over and above reference prices set when the contracts were struck
a month ago.
Trafalgar expects to close out the contracts during the offer period.
It is thought to be the first bidder to use such 'contracts for differences'
which should reduce its costs whether the offer succeeds or fails.
Trafalgar opted for this mechanism rather than buy shares in the target in
the market, the traditional method used by bidders to cover their costs.
Rival merchant bankers said it was a clever scheme which was likely to be
copied. 'Buying shares before or at the start of a bid has become more
difficult because institutions are increasingly loath to sell. And while
picking up 2 or 3 per cent hardly makes much impact on the outcome it can
still leave you with a hefty loss if the bid fails,' said one investment
banker.
The advisory side of Swiss Bank does not know how its derivatives arm has
covered its position, if at all.
If it has bought Northern Electric shares, under the Takeover Code it will
not be able to assent them to the offer until it goes unconditional.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Charge of financial engineering? -
Trafalgar could offset its tax losses, writes Michael Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr David Morris, chairman of Northern Electric, has been involved in one
hostile takeover bid before and, in that contest in the electrical
engineering sector, he was with Delta when it bid unsuccessfully for Scholes
in 1987.
'We are not going to lose this one,' he said as he launched an attempt to
keep his company independent from Trafalgar House. His opponents are equally
determined.
Yesterday's Pounds 1.2bn offer may be insufficient to win Trafalgar its
quarry but analysts believe that the benefits of a takeover for it are such
that it may be willing to offer more if pushed.
The bid will be watched closely throughout the electricity sector. The
possibilities of a white knight emerging from within the sector are being
played down in the City.
Other putative intra-sector alliances, however, together with potential
hostile bids from outside, will be given impetus by the bid, particularly if
it is successful. What then are Trafalgar's chances?
It was still hopeful of a friendly merger, and was trying hard yesterday not
to be hostile to Northern's management but a flavour of criticism inevitably
crept through.
Mr Nigel Rich, chief executive, said that the industry regulator's decision
to seek distribution price cuts of 17 per cent next April from Northern
implied that Northern had much to do in cost cutting. Some regional
companies face price cuts of just 11 per cent.
'Trafalgar's management is confident of its ability to help Northern run its
business more efficiently,' said Mr Rich. Analysts were more convinced about
what Northern could bring to Trafalgar.
Mr Rich pointed to the combination of regulated and non-regulated businesses
and to the possibilities for combining the two companies' electricity
expertise to expand overseas.
Any company would bring similar things. The unusual aspect of Trafalgar's
bid is how it can offset tax losses against Northern's steady stream of
earnings. Trafalgar has Pounds 223m of unrelieved advance corporation tax
and tax losses which could be offset against trading profits and capital
gains. Analysts estimate these could cut Northern's tax rate by up to 5
percentage points.
The capital losses could be put to use in the flotation of the National
Grid, scheduled for May or June. Assuming the regional power companies have
to pay about Pounds 1bn in capital gains tax, Northern's 6.5 per cent share
of that would be Pounds 65m, some or all of which could be offset by
Trafalgar.
This may help to explain why Trafalgar decided to launch its bid more than
three months before the expiry of the government's golden share. Waiting
longer could have meant foregoing the chances to offset Northern's Grid
flotation tax bill.
In the forthcoming weeks Northern will undoubtedly use the 'financial
engineering' charge against Trafalgar. Sensitive to such charges, Mr Simon
Keswick, Trafalgar chairman, said his company had no intention of asset
stripping. 'We want to keep the business,' he said.
Northern will base its attack on Trafalgar's prospects, combined with a
defence of its own record. 'Nearly 60 per cent of the basic offer consists
of paper of uncertain value,' its directors said. However, this argument may
prove of limited value given the cash alternative available which is a 28
per cent premium on Northern's share price a month ago.
In defending their record, Northern managers acknowledge that in the first
two years after privatisation four years ago the company was rated below
average by the sector but say it has been re-evaluated since and this has
been reflected by a rise in its share price.
Mr Morris will be pointing to several distinguishing features about the
company in a sector where 12 companies are constantly trying to
differentiate themselves from each other.
It has, he says, been the most successful in increasing its supply business
outside its area and it was the first to buy back its shares to cut the tax
bills of shareholders.
Yesterday both Trafalgar and Northern were claiming comfort from Northern's
share price which remained, at Pounds 10.18, up 33p on the day, below both
the cash and convertible preference share price offered by Trafalgar.
Trafalgar believes it means the market approves its bid. Northern believes
it means the market is concerned about the possibilities of Trafalgar
clearing all the regulatory and fair trading hurdles in its way.
Either way there is plenty of time for arguments and share prices to change.
Trafalgar said it did not expect to complete the takeover before the end of
March when the government's golden share expires.
Shareholders can comfort themselves with the thought that they are not being
forced to leap to decisions.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berisford statement on US acquisition
expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International is expected imminently to make an announcement
regarding its Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m) takeover talks with Welbilt, the US
kitchen equipment group. The talks are thought to be stalled on price.
Berisford, which yesterday requested a suspension of its shares at 228p
after news of the deal was leaked in London at the weekend, is believed to
have set a deadline for the negotiations.
Welbilt, which manufactures commercial kitchen equipment for fast food
chains such as McDonald's and Burger King, yesterday sought to emphasise the
uncertainty of the negotiations.
It issued a statement saying there could be 'no assurance that an agreement
will be reached with respect to any such transaction, or that any such
transaction will be consummated'.
There was also speculation in the US that Welbilt had been in discussions
with other parties about a possible takeover. Berisford yesterday denied any
knowledge of potential rivals.
US analysts suggested that a price of Dollars 35 a share, or roughly Dollars
500m, would be enough to tempt Mr Jerome Kohlberg, Welbilt's 47 per cent
shareholder. 'At that price I do not think they would want to lose their
bidder,' said one.
However, there were some reservations over the possibility that a bid would
have to rely on a rights issue.
In the UK, however, investors have long known about the ambitions of Mr Alan
Bowkett, chief executive, to build a global business in the services or
manufacturing sectors.
He arrived almost three years ago, after a series of asset disposals rescued
the former property and commodities group from the brink of collapse. At the
time, he said he intended to build Berisford with finance raised from
property sales or rights issues.
An attempt last year to take over C&amp;J Clark, the shoe company, was
unsuccessful.
Earlier this year, however, Berisford bought Magnet, the kitchen and joinery
manufacturer and retailer, for Pounds 56m.

FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Fairhaven bid terms disclosed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eagleville announced the terms yesterday of a paper and cash offer for
Fairhaven International, the Bermuda-registered holding company which has
OGC International, the oil services group, as its main asset.
The offer, which was first revealed on November 9, values Fairhaven at
Pounds 71m.
Eagleville, which already owns 28.9 per cent of Fairhaven, is controlled by
Mr Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping magnate. Through other interests, Mr
Olsen controls 75 per cent of Fairhaven. The offer is designed as a
tidying-up exercise for Olsen interests and a means of taking Fairhaven
private.
Eagleville is offering one OGC share for every 5 Fairhaven shares, giving
them a value of about 29p.
This is a 30 per cent premium over the price of 22 1/2 p that Fairhaven
shares had on November 8, the day before its directors announced that they
had received an approach from Eagleville which might lead to an offer.
Alternatively, shareholders can elect to take a cash offer of 27p a share.
Nearly 60 per cent of holders have so far undertaken to accept the paper and
not the cash offer.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Asian markets feel the squeeze in a shrinking world: Peter
Montagnon reviews prospects after global ripples
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago, says one Asian stockbroker, it would have been unthinkable
for the region's markets to have tumbled on the news that a local authority
in the US had gone bankrupt. That this has been the case with California's
Orange County shows how global markets have become.
Asian shares fell sharply on Orange County's troubles with Hong Kong
particularly badly affected, though many have since recovered some lost
ground.
Fund managers say the underlying tone remains weak and admit that 1994 has
been pretty disappointing after last year's stellar performance. Attention
is now turning to 1995.
Perhaps Asia will shake off the interest rate gloom emanating from the US
and resume its position at the top of the world performance league. But
confidence is far from strong.
In theory there are good arguments why Asian markets should recover. While
interest rates have tended to rise around the region in response to tighter
money in the US, the effect on economic output should be marginal with most
countries expecting little worse than a slight softening of this year's high
growth rates. Indeed the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank has forecast a rise to
5.8 per cent from 5.5 per cent in Hong Kong's growth next year. 'Asia is
delivering more than its fair share of earnings growth,' says Mr David Bates
of Asia Equity in London. 'Therefore de-coupling (from the US) in 1995 is a
fair possibility.'
However, few brokers and fund managers predict a speedy turnround in the new
year and several think the markets could fall further.
Part of the problem is that no rally can be sustained by local demand alone.
Some brokers argue that local investors have neither the cash nor the
confidence to drive equity markets higher on their own. Share prices will
only really start to recover, they argue, once foreign institutional
liquidity returns. Yet Asia is low on the shopping list of US investors now
they can obtain higher yields in the money and bond market.
Liquid markets such as Hong Kong have also taken a hammering. On this basis
it would appear that the markets least at risk are those such as South Korea
and Taiwan which are insulated from the ebb and flow of foreign liquidity by
regulatory controls on overseas investment.
But others will not necessarily recover automatically. Part of the question
is whether US buyers will return in force at all if higher interest rates
make equity investment less fashionable in the US than bonds and money
market instruments.
Mr Angus Armstrong, Morgan Grenfell's economics director in Hong Kong, says
the real question is where the capital flows will go. 'The markets which
will suffer most are those which have been most exposed to international
capital flows.'
Markets where currencies are aligned to the US dollar are particularly
vulnerable to repatriation of foreign investment. This category, he says,
includes Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Hong Kong.
Then there are regional factors. Overshadowing the Hong Kong market are
worries that China's economy might be heading for a hard landing. Chinese
companies which are quoted there have been hard hit in recent weeks on
worries about the ability of state enterprises to service their debts and
about the cavalier way China has treated some foreign investors such as the
restaurant chain McDonald's which has had its lease in Beijing terminated.
There also remains a risk that China will fail to control inflation and rein
in state enterprises. Repercussions would be felt further afield, given the
extent to which companies from countries such as the Philippines, Taiwan and
Singapore have invested in China.
Malaysia has also disappointed this year. Some investors hope that elections
expected next year will help lift share prices as political parties step up
their spending to win voter support. The same could be true of Thailand
where the coalition government is in disarray.
Another worry is that Japanese investment in the region could slow when the
yen starts to weaken, as higher exchange rates would erode the competitive
advantage of other Asian countries.
By 1996 the earnings position could look weaker. BZW forecasts that earnings
growth that year will have fallen sharply on this year's level in almost all
markets, except the Philippines. Crosby Securities believes Thailand will
show earnings growth of 21.5 per cent in 1996 against 21.9 per cent this
year. Earnings growth will be slightly higher by then in Singapore but will
have fallen back in Hong Kong, Malaysia and, in contrast to BZW's forecast,
the Philippines.
In other words, earnings growth may be reasonable next year, but there are
doubts about 1996. Those who are punting on an Asian market recovery next
year must believe US liquidity will return before the markets start looking
past the peak of the earnings cycle.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Warburg director to leave in bond shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg, the investment bank, yesterday signalled a shake-up of its bond
operations after the collapse of its planned merger with Morgan Stanley by
replacing the heads of its fixed-interest and treasury division.
The investment bank brought in Mr David Burnett, the head of its UK equities
business, to take over from Mr Peter Bass and Mr Peter Twachtmann. He is
expected to re-structure bond operations, which have performed poorly this
year.
Mr Twachtmann, a board director who has been with Warburg for 26 years, is
leaving the bank after being told the news on Friday. Mr Bass is to take a
position in Warburg's US arm, a move he was already planning.
Before taking over Warburg's UK equities business, Mr Burnett's job was to
re-shape the Tokyo equities operation. He is given credit for returning it
to profit, and re-shaping it after the Japanese equity market collapse.
Warburg told staff in an internal note yesterday that Mr Burnett's task 'in
the face of continuing difficult market conditions' was to 'reinvigorate and
renew' the firm's fixed-interest operation.
The shake-up was planned before the collapse of the merger plans last
Thursday, but was implemented when Warburg's board met to consider Morgan
Stanley's merger pull out.
Warburg has a strong presence in sterling Eurobonds, and is a gilt-edged
market maker. However, its operations in other European government bonds are
likely to be reviewed. Morgan Stanley was regarded as a good fit for Warburg
for the US firm's expertise in bond trading.
Warburg's US operation, which employs more than 600 staff, could also face
further changes. It has expanded rapidly in the past two years under Mr Tom
Wyman, a Warburg vice-chairman, who has been in charge of building its US
presence.
Mr Wyman said yesterday that Mr Bass's new role was 'not exactly' decided,
although he would take a senior post. He said Warburg would continue its
growth in the US, although some staff were still 'a little off-balance'.
He said there was unlikely to be a change in the balance of control between
London and New York. 'I would not be here if I was concerned that functional
management in London would be taking control in a decisive way,' he said.
Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, said on Friday that Warburg intended
to resume a strategy of independent expansion 'with adaptations and
variations'. The bank's shares yesterday closed 28p down at 685p.

FT  20 DEC 94 / ITT puts Dollars 1.7bn on Caesars World flutter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITT, the US conglomerate that has been seeking to expand in the leisure
industry, is to buy Caesars World, one of the best-known names in gaming,
for Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in cash.
ITT has agreed to buy the company for Dollars 67.50 a share through a tender
offer beginning on Friday. Caesars World had net income of Dollars 78.4m on
revenues of Dollars 1bn in the year to last July. It has three casino and
hotel complexes  - in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and on the shore of Lake
Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada.
The biggest of the three, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, occupies an 80-acre
site on the famed Las Vegas Strip. It is based on an ancient Rome theme,
with toga-clad dealers and a massive chariot parked in a corner. Zagat, a US
hotel guide, describes the hotel rooms as 'like a bordello', with circular
beds and overhead mirrors.
ITT's businesses include insurance, communications and information,
automotive sales, fluid technology and defence. Recently, however, it has
been trying to expand in the growth sector of leisure and entertainment,
where it is already active through its ownership of the Sheraton hotel
chain.
Earlier this year ITT began the process of taking over Ciga, the Italian
luxury hotel group, of which it now owns 70 per cent. In August it acquired
the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex in New York for
Dollars 1.1bn in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television
company.
In September ITT said it was seeking buyers for its financial services
subsidiary, ITT Financial, in a sale that could fetch Dollars 3bn-Dollars
4bn. It wanted to use the funds to expand its leisure interests further.
ITT is already in the gaming industry: it owns the Sheraton Desert Inn hotel
and casino complex in Las Vegas and a riverboat casino in Tunica, Missouri.
In May it said it was going to build a Dollars 750m Desert Kingdom hotel and
casino complex in Las Vegas, but in October it cancelled the plans.
Yesterday's agreement indicated that ITT now plans to buy existing gaming
interests rather than build its own.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Trafalgar in Pounds 1.2bn offer for Northern: Customers
promised Pounds 20 rebate - Rec spurns 'financially challenged' bidder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The first contested takeover bid in the UK utility sector was under way last
night as Northern Electric, the regional power company for north-east
England, rejected a Pounds 1.2bn offer from Trafalgar House.
Northern's board said it could see no advantage to its shareholders in
becoming part of a 'financially challenged conglomerate, effectively
controlled by an offshore minority shareholder'.
Hongkong Land, a subsidiary of Bermuda-based Jardine Matheson has a 25 per
cent stake in Trafalgar.
If Trafalgar succeeds with its bid, signalled last Wednesday, it intends to
offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of Northern's 1.3m to 1.4m customers.
Analysts believe that could set a precedent for future takeovers in the
sector.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour party industry spokesman, predicted an orgy of bids
and mergers involving privatised utilities, offering 'the prospect of
guaranteed risk-free profits at the public expense'. He called for the bid
to be referred to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission.
The bid is also being considered by Prof Stephen Littlechild, industry
regulator. Mr Nigel Rich, Trafalgar chief executive, said Prof Littlechild
had told him on Sunday that he would be consulting publicly, although the
regulator's office was unable to confirm this last night.
Mr Simon Keswick, Trafalgar chairman, said he did not believe the bid would
be referred to the MMC. 'In our judgment, it is unlikely,' he said. Mr Rich
said Trafalgar wanted friendly discussions with Northern's management. 'We
have attempted to talk to them but they said they want to see our offer
first.'
Northern's shareholders are being offered Pounds 44.35 in cash and 65 new
Trafalgar convertible preference shares for every 10 shares they hold. With
the convertibles down 3 1/2 p to 94 1/2 p yesterday this valued each
Northern share at Pounds 10.58. There is also a full cash alternative of
Pounds 10.48 a share compared with Northern's close of Pounds 10.18, up 33p.
Northern shareholders can opt to obtain part of the consideration in the
form of 'grids', interest-bearing bonds which give them rights to shares in
the National Grid, 6.5 per cent of which is owned by Northern, if it is
floated next summer.
For these purposes, Trafalgar estimates that each Northern share contains
Pounds 2 for the Grid element. This implies a market capitalisation for the
Grid of about Pounds 3.5bn against City estimates of more than Pounds 4bn.
Grids will be tradeable and a grey market is expected to develop after the
offer document goes out.
Hongkong Land has agreed to buy the first Pounds 310m of preference shares
to meet elections for the cash alternative, Following implementation of the
offer, it could hold up to 31 per cent of the ordinary shares of Trafalgar
assuming full conversion. However, it said it had 'no present intention' of
holding more than 30 per cent of ordinary shares.
Trafalgar is advised by Swiss Bank Corporation and Northern by SG Warburg.

FT  20 DEC 94 / British Steel forges US venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three big steelmakers from the US, the UK and Japan announced a joint
venture to produce low-cost steel in the US, a move which could be followed
by similar ventures around the world.
LTV has a 50 per cent stake in the venture, called Trico Steel, with British
Steel and Sumitomo Metal Industries holding 25 per cent each. Together they
will spend Dollars 450m (Pounds 274m) to build a 'minimill' in the
south-eastern part of the US, with production due to begin in 1996.
Minimills make steel from scrap, skipping many of the steps in traditional
steelmaking. By employing newer technology and non-unionised labour, small
minimill companies have become the low-cost producers of the steel industry.
Led by Nucor, which pioneered the technology in the US and which is now the
country's most profitable steelmaker, they have taken more than a third of
the US steel market from old-line makers.
The plant will have the capacity to manufacture 2.2m tons of flat-rolled
steel a year, making it one of the biggest minimills in the US.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman of British Steel, said the venture would expand
the company's involvement in the US and in the 'rapidly evolving minimill
technologies'. LTV said of the three-way relationship: 'This will be very
important long-term. This is now a global business.'
Big old-fashioned steel companies, which have spent much of the past decade
reeling from falling demand and prices, are trying to regain the lead in new
production technology. US Steel, the US's biggest producer, recently
announced a feasibility study with Nucor into a new generation of minimill
technology which could bring down production costs still further.
Through the Trico venture, all three companies 'will have the chance to gain
experience of minimill technology', said LTV.
The venture signals renewed expansion at LTV, once one of the US's biggest
and most diverse industrial conglomerates. In June 1993 the company emerged
from seven years in bankruptcy, having been stripped of many of its
businesses. It is now the US's third biggest steelmaker, with production of
7.9m tons last year. Trico will make flat-rolled steel to compete in the
hot-rolled and higher-value cold-rolled markets.

FT  20 DEC 94 / OECD predicts 2 years of steady growth for UK: Low inflation
and better job prospects expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain can expect at least two more years of steady economic growth, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday.
In its latest half-yearly outlook, the Paris-based body, which represents 25
leading industrial nations, adds that the present economic upturn should be
healthier than previous recoveries. Inflation will remain relatively low
even though unemployment will fall significantly.
But the organisation urges the British government to raise interest rates
again to curb any inflation. It predicts that bank base rates will rise to 7
per cent next year, and to 7.5 per cent at the start of 1996. Although this
marks a significant increase, the OECD says UK interest rates should remain
well below the peaks seen in previous cycles.
'The current recovery differs from previous upswings in several respects . .
. controlling inflation may be possible with lower interest rate rises than
in the past as monetary and fiscal policies have been tightened much earlier
in the cycle,' it says.
One factor that may help keep inflation down, the OECD suggests, is the
relatively high level of spare capacity estimated to exist in the UK
economy.
In spite of mounting concern in the City that recent strong growth could be
overheating the economy, the OECD says the UK has more spare capacity than
any of the leading seven industrial nations. It calculates that the UK
output gap, which represents the difference between potential and actual
growth, is 4 per cent.
In addition, the report says the structural reforms that occurred in the UK
during the 1980s may help keep interest rates low.
The OECD gives a cautious welcome to the deregulation of the UK labour
market. The changes which have taken place in recent years mean falling
unemployment may not push up inflation as fast as in the past, it says,
predicting unemployment will fall below 8 per cent in the next two years.
Although the report was written before the recent Budget and interest rate
rise, it says the tax increases introduced earlier this year should slow the
pace of recovery slightly next year.
Gross domestic product is predicted to grow by 3.4 per cent next year,
slowing to 3 per cent the following year. This is slightly more optimistic
than the Treasury's forecast of 3.25 per cent growth next year. Inflation is
forecast to remain relatively low next year, but is expected to rise to 2.6
per cent in 1996.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the report was 'very encouraging'.
In a separate report, however, market research group Gallup pointed to a
worsening 'feel-bad' factor in the UK. It said yesterday that its December
survey of consumer confidence showed a sharp increase in the number of
households expecting their financial position to worsen next year.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce signs deal to use BMW engines in future models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next generation of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars will be powered by
BMW-supplied engines, and developed in collaboration with the German car
maker, under an agreement signed yesterday.
The deal between Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury cars subsidiary of UK
engineering group Vickers, and BMW, which bought Rover Group from British
Aerospace in January, followed nearly a year of negotiations.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, described it as 'an extremely
significant stage for the group in mapping the medium- and long-term future
for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, and in the continuing process of stabilising and
positioning all the group's businesses for future growth'.
BMW is to supply V12 and V8 engines, which will be further developed with
Rolls's Crewe engineers and Vickers' Cosworth Engineering subsidiary to make
them more suitable for use in the British company's cars.
The supply of other components, including gearboxes, is under consideration.
The two companies will also explore ways of developing and bringing to
market 'Concept Java', a small coupe prototype. It has just completed a
'world tour' of motor shows and received favourable reviews.
Sir Colin stressed Rolls-Royce was not for sale, nor would any equity stake
be offered in it 'for the forseeable future'.
The agreement relieves Rolls-Royce of the burden of developing its own
engines  - an increasingly complex and costly exercise given stringent
emission and fuel economy standards.
The deal with BMW was reached only after Rolls-Royce had conducted parallel
negotiations with Mercedes-Benz. Sir Colin said Vickers had made maximum use
of the rivalry between the two German groups.
The agreement would not mean job losses at the Crewe plant, said Mr Peter
Ward, Rolls-Royce's chairman. Nor would BMW's name appear anywhere on the UK
company's cars.
The deal comes as Rolls-Royce's sales are slowly improving after one of the
steepest falls on record. This year it expects to sell about 1,400 cars, and
some analysts predict profits for this year of up to Pounds 12m.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Russians step up pressure on rebels in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fighting intensified yesterday around the Chechen capital of Grozny, and
there seemed little doubt that Russia has committed its troops to a final
battle with Chechen forces.
Russian soldiers were still holding back from an assault on Grozny itself,
but the conflict, which threatens the stability of the Russian government,
was entering a new phase in the rebel Caucasian republic.
Early yesterday, Russian jets tried to knock out the TV tower in Grozny.
They also failed in an attempt to bomb Chechen president Dzhokar Dudayev's
residence, Chechen officials said. Further raids took place during the
evening and Chechen television briefly went off the air.
Support for a decisive military campaign came from a meeting of Russian
ministers and senior parliamentarians in Moscow. Interfax news agency
reported that the meeting had decided to 'eliminate' illegal groups, and
that the flight of much of the civilian population from Grozny and
surrounding areas had helped 'the actions of the Russian armed forces'.
The meeting blamed General Dudayev for refusing to negotiate, although Mr
Leonid Smiryagin, an adviser to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president,
said talks were still possible.
However, he said that the Chechen leader would have to come to Mozdok, the
Russian base near the Chechen border. Last night Gen Dudayev again asked for
talks but it was not clear if he was ready to meet Russian conditions for
starting them.
Mr Smiryagin hinted at the justification for an advance on Grozny: 'So far,
there is hope that Dudayev maintains some kind of order in the city. If it
fades, reports will start to come about looting of the population and
anarchy, and the federal authorities will have no way out other than to
storm the city.'
Yesterday's fighting was concentrated around the settlements of Dolinskoye,
20 miles from the capital, and Petropavlovsk, six miles north-east of
Grozny. Reporters said many houses in the Dolinskoye area were destroyed or
in flames.
Opposition in Russia to the war remains strong, even among senior military
officials, and the divisions are echoed by the Russian leadership.
Lieutenant General Valery Vostrokin, a deputy minister for emergency
situations, said in neighbouring Ingushetia yesterday that the army should
not be used to establish order on Russian territory. Interviews with
officers and soldiers have also revealed a widespread dislike of the duty in
Chechnya.

<TEXT>
British Petroleum yesterday overtook British Telecom to become the biggest
company by market capitalisation on the London Stock Exchange. Admittedly,
BP's achievement is not unaided  - BT's share price fell yesterday as it
went ex-dividend. The telecoms group has underperformed this year because of
fears about competition from cable television and its less than ambitious
dividend policy. But BP's success is real nonetheless. Its re-rating since
1992 is a tribute to the cultural revolution put in place by the the
company's new management and its impressive earnings performance in a
difficult environment.

FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Cadbury Schweppes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury Schweppes is in a bind. Its trading this year has been better than
that of most food manufacturing companies, yet the immediate future looks
troubled. The shares are down 8 per cent in the past month and nearly 18 per
cent in the past year.
Investors' concerns are understandable, if overdone. They centre on
Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages, the UK bottling operation 51 per cent owned
by Cadbury. While this has been the motor of the group's growth in recent
years, the reliability  - and therefore the quality of earnings  - from this
business has clearly deteriorated. The culprit is the outbreak of Cola wars
as the supermarkets bring out their own products in an attempt to undercut
the traditional premium prices enjoyed by Coke. Packaging prices are rising
and next summer's weather is unlikely to be so clement as in 1994. It is
thus probable that CCSB's operating profits will fall sharply next year.
The impact on Cadbury's earnings per share will however be diluted by the
fact that CCSB is not fully-owned. Moreover, trading is strong in
confectionery and Cadbury's earnings are likely to beat those of the sector
as a whole next year, notwithstanding brokers' reduced profits forecasts.
The period of underperformance for Cadbury should be coming to an end.

FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce/BMW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both Rolls-Royce, the Vickers luxury car subsidiary, and BMW have reason to
congratulate themselves on their supply agreement. BMW has outsmarted its
rival Mercedes Benz to forge a link which will considerably strengthen its
position at the very top end of the automotive market. So soon after the
Rover acquisition, it has again demonstrated its nimbleness in seizing the
strategic initiative.
For Rolls-Royce, the alliance will secure its future as an independent
company beyond the current generation of cars. Vickers has been good at
cutting Rolls-Royce's costs and improving its efficiency but does not have
the financial clout to develop a luxury car for the next century out of its
own resources. Under the agreement Rolls-Royce will get engines and other
components more cheaply than if it developed or made them itself, while BMW
will be able to spread the costs of producing such large engines over higher
volumes.
The deal has been done without Vickers having to cede a ha'porth of
Rolls-Royce's equity, but the question of control may in time prove an
irrelevance. In 10 years or so the German company is likely to have made
itself indispensable to Rolls-Royce, so that BMW would be the obvious buyer
should Vickers chose to sell. In the meantime shareholders in both companies
should benefit.

FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: ITT/Caesars World
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT believes casino gambling is potentially more lucrative than financial
services. That much became evident from yesterday's Dollars 1.7bn purchase
of Caesars World, coupled with its proclaimed determination to sell its loan
and mortgage businesses during the coming few weeks. The rationale is not
complicated. The immediate prospects for gaming are better than for ITT's
loans operations; the North American gaming market is currently enjoying
double-digit growth and enviable margins.
The strategy ITT chose to deepen its exposure to gambling through
acquisition must be right. By buying Caesars, ITT gains an internationally
recognised brand-name, acquires first-class management in an area where the
group admits weakness and creates the possibility of synergies between the
casinos and ITT's Sheraton hotels. By deciding to abandon its plans to
construct a new Las Vegas casino, ITT also avoids increasing competition in
an already tight market.
That said, the north American gaming market is evolving rapidly; present
growth looks unsustainable as new capacity is being added at a rapid rate on
river boats and in Indian reservations. ITT's turn at the gaming table will
not be without its risks.

FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar's tax heaven
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A tie-up between Trafalgar House and Northern Electric would be a marriage
made in financial heaven. The strategic fit might be questionable, but the
tax savings would be very real, far outweighing the Pounds 26m windfall
pay-out to Northern's consumers if Trafalgar succeeded. Trafalgar holds
substantial capital gains losses, after two terrible years. These would
off-set capital gains from the demerger of Northern's National Grid stake,
saving at least Pounds 50m in tax. The bidder has a further Pounds 223m of
unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax to be used against electricity profits,
and there are trading tax losses on top.
The financial logic should dissolve shareholder concern over the logic of
moving into electricity distribution, about which Trafalgar knows little.
Trafalgar's strategy of building stable earnings to fund infrastructure
projects may not appeal to shareholders who had invested in a cyclical
engineering and construction company, but Northern's share price, 30p below
the cash offer, suggests little expectation of a bidding war. Delay through
a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission seems more likely, but
it is hard to imagine the grounds on which the bid could be blocked.
The current discount to the offer price may instead reflect the fact that
Trafalgar appears to have offered a full price. Only last week, political
concerns were hounding the sector, and the likelihood of Labour government
can hardly be said to have receded at Dudley West. Taxation notwithstanding,
Trafalgar's non-Hong Kong investors may make it hard for the company to pay
more.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Ruling on time limits clarified -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Community law does not preclude the application of a national rule
which limits the period for which invalidity benefit may be payable under an
EC directive, even where the directive has not been properly implemented,
the European Court of Justice ruled recently.
In 1970 Mrs Elsie Johnson gave up work to look after her daughter. In 1980,
she tried to go back to work but was unable to do so because of a back
complaint, for which she was granted non-contributory invalidity benefit.
In 1982, she started living with a man and benefit was stopped because,
under English law at the time, a woman cohabiting with a man had to show not
only that she was unfit for work but also that she was unfit to carry out
normal household duties. That criterion did not apply to males.
In 1984, non-contributory invalidity benefit was replaced by a severe
disablement allowance which could be granted to persons of either sex under
identical conditions. The allowance could be claimed automatically by
persons entitled to the old benefit without having to satisfy the new
allowance conditions.
Mrs Johnson was refused automatic entitlement. This refusal was based on
domestic legislation, whose effect was to deny an applicant the allowance if
payment of the non-contributory invalidity benefit had not been claimed
before its abolition.
The Social Security Commissioners referred the matter to the European Court
of Justice to determine whether such a rule was compatible with the relevant
EC directive.
The Court held that it had been possible to rely on the provisions of the
directive following its implementation in 1984 in order to set aside
national rules on the entitlement to benefits which discriminated against
women. The provisions also entitled women disadvantaged by maintenance of
the discrimination to be treated in the same manner as men in the same
situation.
Following this ruling, the Social Security Commissioners granted Mrs Johnson
the severe disablement allowance, but only with effect from August 1986, 12
months prior to her claim. This restriction on her rights to the allowance
was made under domestic legislation.
Mrs Johnson appealed to the Court of Appeal. Her argument centred on the
ECJ's decision in the Emmott case. In Emmott the ECJ ruled EC law precluded
the competent authorities of a member state from relying on national
procedural rules imposing time-limits on legal actions in proceedings
brought by an individual to protect directly effective rights conferred by a
directive where that directive had not been properly implemented by the
member state.
The Appeal Court sought a preliminary ruling from the ECJ on the scope of
the Emmott judgment in relation to Mrs Johnson's case. It wanted to know
whether the domestic rule restricting the right to the allowance to a fixed
period prior to the date of a claim was compatible with EC law.
Although the ECJ found the directive had not been implemented correctly and
the domestic rule was a national procedural rule on time-limits, it ruled
its finding in Emmott should not apply.
The Court said its decision in Emmott had been justified by the
circumstances of that case, in which a time-bar had the result of depriving
the applicant of any opportunity to rely on equal treatment rights under the
directive.
In contrast, the domestic rule in the present case merely limited to one
year the retroactive effect of claims for invalidity benefits.
The Court had already ruled that the rights of women to claim such benefits
had to be exercised under the conditions imposed by domestic law provided
they were no less favourable than those relating to domestic actions and
provided they were not framed so as to render it virtually impossible for
individuals to exercise their EC rights.
In the present case, those criteria were fulfilled. The Court ruled,
therefore, that the domestic legislation in question was compatible with EC
law.

On the eve of talks today with Mr John Bruton, the newly-appointed Irish
prime minister, Mr Major said the Northern Ireland framework document under
discussion between London and Dublin would not undercut the rights of
Ulster's unionist community.
He emphasised that the discovery at the weekend of an unexploded semtex bomb
in Enniskillen showed the importance of the IRA decommissioning its armoury
before Sinn Fein was brought into round-table political talks on the future
of the province.
'What the planting of this device shows precisely is why it is so important
to deal with the problems of weapons and explosives.'
Referring to yesterday's bilateral contacts with Sinn Fein, Mr Major
commented: 'We have always made clear that there can be no question of
political representatives of paramilitary organisations entering the
political process until they have a commitment to exclusively peaceful
methods  - and have demonstrated that commitment to exclusively peaceful
methods.'
The prime minister would not specify how Britain would react to the
decommissioning of the IRA weapons stockpile. But he expressed hopes that
continued peace would bring further gradual moves in security and policing
operations in Northern Ireland.
'Both the government and the Royal Ulster Constabulary would like to move to
wholly civilian policing . . . that is going to take some time but it is a
clear objective.'
In a response to suggestions from Mr Albert Reynolds, Mr Bruton's
predecessor, that Britain had conceded the creation of a new cross-border
institution with executive powers, Mr Major said: 'There is no question of
joint authority, which is what worries the people of Northern Ireland.'
Mr Major stressed that, once completed, the framework document would be a
basis for discussion among the Northern Ireland parties, not a blueprint for
a new political settlement imposed by the British and Irish governments.
Any new arrangements would require the consent of the people and would be
submitted eventually to a referendum. 'If we have learnt anything about the
Northern Ireland problem over recent years it is that you have to carry the
people of Northern Ireland with you,' Mr Major said.
'We must earn and keep their trust and they must be clear that there is
nothing going on that would unsettle either main tradition . . . So those
people who are thinking: 'Gosh, there is some murky work at the crossroads'
are wholly wrong.'
Mr Major expected today's meeting with Mr Bruton to be an informal
discussion. He said it was too early to say whether the document would be
completed in January.
'We will move ahead as speedily as we can. There are still some difficult
issues to be determined. I think they are determinable but it will take a
little while.'

Wanted  - a new Butcher of Broadway. The New York Times, whose theatre
reviews used to be able to make or break new Broadway shows, is changing its
theatre critic.
David Richards, the paper's lead theatre critic, is quitting after only a
year in the job. The word is that his reviews have not been rude enough for
some New Yorkers.
Richards' departure would not normally be worthy of comment except for the
fact that New York is the hub of US theatre and the NYT is the only voice
that really matters when it comes to reviewing shows. A bad review could
kill a good show when Frank Rich was sitting in the lead critic's chair.
Richards' problem, on the other hand, seems to have been that his reviews
have been a bit short on vitriol and this has caused a certain tension
between him and his superiors.
Vincent Canby, 70, the theatre critic for the Sunday NYT, is standing in for
the moment, but the word is that Ben Brantley, Richards' 40-year-old deputy,
is warming up in the bull pen.

Visitors to the US Treasury are better off leaving their guns at home.
Unfortunately, Charles Corry, the head of USX, owner of the country's
biggest steelmaker, forgot that simple rule last week and now faces a
maximum penalty of 180 days in jail.
It's an easy enough mistake for the modern business executive to make. Corry
regularly lugs a .32 calibre pistol around in his briefcase. Well, who
doesn't these days?
The snag is, he is only licensed to carry it in his home state of
Pennsylvania.
Surprising as it may be, Washington DC has strict gun laws  - everything is
relative  - and the state doesn't take kindly to visitors toting firearms.
Corry's concealed weapon showed up on a scanner as he entered the Treasury,
leading to his prompt arrest.
He will be explaining himself in court in January.

Christians at Lloyd's is not an updated version of chucking believers into

'If people are in the state that they are in, then we can't just walk by on
the other side of the road,' says Nigel Found, one of the group's stewards.
Found says Christians at Lloyd's also will fight the bad publicity the
market has recently attracted: 'When a market has fallen into disrepute in
the way that, sadly, Lloyd's has, then we need to do something about that.'
The group is tomorrow organising a meeting with pop singer Helen Shapiro,
who suggests one of her records  - Walking Back to Happiness - as a Lloyd's

Surely the Eagles' hit  - Hotel California  - is more appropriate? As it
says: 'You can check out any time, but you can never leave.'

Nigel Whittaker, the energetic Kingfisher director and chairman-elect of the
British Retail Consortium, is irritated that public references to cash being
given to the Tory party gives the impression that Labour gets nothing from
companies.
Whittaker says his own company is this year giving the Tories Pounds 25,000
 - disclosed in the company's annual report  - and also providing Labour
with some Pounds 14,000, in the form of sponsorship and advertising.
Whittaker reckons that Blair's boys may soon be doing very nicely from
undisclosed corporate munificence, and plans to canvass his fellow retail
directors to ask them how much their companies surreptitiously give Labour.
Time, surely, for a Liberal Democrat to put forward a private member's bill
banning any and all form of corporate donation to any political party?

It's obvious when you think about it. Ted Turner wants to buy NBC because
otherwise his Turner Broadcasting Systems would look pretty silly in 1996,
when Atlanta hosts the next summer Olympics. Turner's cable channels are
based in Atlanta, yet would be unable to broadcast the games.
But NBC's owner, General Electric, is probably putting the price up each
passing day. The rights to broadcast pictures of the games don't come cheap;
NBC paid the International Olympic Committee Dollars 456m. And NBC reckons
it's already reached half its Dollars 600m target for pre-sold advertising.
Coca Cola promises Dollars 62m, General Motors Dollars 50m, and McDonald's
Dollars 30m  - and the games are still 19 months away.
Turner says he just wants a tiny slice of broadcasting rights. NBC chief
Dick Ebersol, who wants to see something up front before striking any such
deal, wants to see Turner's cash. Now, if a deal is struck, who might Turner
fire first . . .?

FT  20 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Mr Mandela takes stock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Nelson Mandela's honeymoon with the South African electorate
finally came to an end over the weekend, when the African National Congress
(ANC), gathered in Bloemfontein for its first conference since it won
elections in April.
It would have been understandable if the party used the event to dwell on
its extraordinary achievement since its inaugural gathering in the same city
over 80 years ago. Instead the party is subjecting itself to a brutally
frank critique of its performance in office.
This is as it should be, for to do otherwise would smack of complacency. As
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general, put it in his official report to
the delegates, the ANC is a liberation movement still struggling to come to
terms with its success at the ballot box last April. The party is heavily
indebted, riven by 'cliques, factions, tensions and squabbles', he said. It
has failed to tackle continuing township instability, rising crime and high
unemployment, and is faced by one overriding concern: the failure to meet
black expectations.
No one expected it to be easy, given Mr Mandela's dilemma. South Africa's
stability, and its appeal to foreign investors, rests on the new
government's capacity to maintain white confidence. To do so, Mr Mandela has
chosen to act pragmatically  - but in the process he has lost black support,
particularly among impatient black youth.
There is no simple way out for Mr Mandela. If he is to deliver on the key
issues  - jobs, housing, education, land reform  - he has to preside over a
growing economy. To do this, he must bring with him a white community whose
role in both business and the security forces is disproportionate to its
numbers. And most difficult of all, he must turn a civil service moulded by
apartheid into a loyal, efficient administration, without which the best
conceived policies will fail.
Complex problems
There are other brakes on the government's capacity to deliver. It is
learning to live with a constitution which decentralises power to nine
provincial assemblies. Although the ANC controls seven of them, they are
developing minds of their own, not susceptible to reform by diktat. Add to
this the complexity of the problems to be addressed, whether the huge
housing backlog, or the gross disparity in land ownership.
Nor is Mr Mandela's task made easier by the nature of the ANC itself. It is
a still a coalition, originally driven by a single overriding objective  -
the end of white minority rule. Now that has been achieved, the cracks in
the coalition are emerging, for it encompasses a very broad political
spectrum, ranging from advocates of market-driven policies, through militant
trade unionists to members of the influential South African Communist party.
State patronage
In the past, Africa's leaders were able to sustain comparable coalitions
after independence by resorting to state patronage through nationalisation
and jobs in government service. Mr Mandela, however, has taken office in a
new Africa, where economic policies are constrained by structural adjustment
programmes which reduce such patronage through policies that include
privatisation, market driven exchange rates, and trade liberalisation.
In the longer term, it might well be healthy for development and democracy
in South Africa if there was a fundamental realignment in the country's
politics, with the left of the ANC breaking away and standing on its own
platform.
First, however, the party must put its own house in order. It must become an
organised and focused political party, instead of a liberation coalition.
And for the current five-year parliamentary session at least, the ANC and
its partners in the government of national unity must work together to
provide the jobs and social services that will form the foundations of the
new South Africa.
The danger, as Mr Mandela warned at the weekend, is that the ANC might
attempt to regain lost popularity on the basis of populist rhetoric.
If the party heeds his warning, and imposes discipline on its feuding
factions, Bloemfontein could mark the moment when the ANC came to grips with
its new responsibility.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Ready to ride out the storm: The UK's embattled prime
minister, John Major, outlines his objectives to Richard Lambert and Philip
Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major is not giving up. His government lags further behind in the
opinion polls than any other in post-war history. Sections of the
Conservative party frequently seem bent on self-destruction. Mr Tony Blair
is beginning to fashion an electable Labour party.
But the prime minister intends to ride out the storm, to fight a general
election he believes may well not take place until mid-1997.
Speaking in the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street yesterday morning, Mr
Major's mood was quiet, initially rather hesitant. But his message during a
45-minute conversation was unambiguous.
He says he is not one of those politicians who bangs the table. He does not
believe that to have convictions you have to take up extreme positions. But
he has clear ambitions  - for the economy, for Northern Ireland, for a
radical reshaping of public services to devolve power to individuals. He
intends to see them through. Those in the Tory party who imagine that Mr
Major might just get up and walk away should think again.
Political recovery, he concedes, will depend on restoring party unity, as
well as what the prime minister describes as 'the best economic recovery in
living memory'. Last week's by-election defeat at the hands of Labour in
Dudley West was 'a very poor result'.
Although Tory in-fighting did not entirely explain the biggest swing from
Conservative to Labour in 60 years, the lesson is: 'Firstly, the party must
want to be united'.
Mr Major warms to the theme: 'I think the Conservative party in the country
would think it would be folly running off the Richter scale if the party
were not to come together and unite behind the economic recovery.'
But it cannot be peace on his enemies' terms. We turn to the position of the
nine so-called Tory rebels, the Eurosceptic MPs suspended for defying the
government in a vote on Britain's contributions to Brussels. Their treatment
technically deprives Mr Major of his overall majority at Westminster, though
on most issues he can rely on the nine Ulster Unionist MPs for support.
The prime minister is unapologetic. It is self-evident that there was 'no
choice' but to suspend them once the MPs withheld their support on a vote of
confidence.
The same principles apply to their possible return to the fold. The rebels
are Conservatives and Mr Major hopes they will support the government in the
months ahead: 'In due course one can consider whether they should be
re-admitted to the party whip. But it is not imminent at all; they must show
that they are in the business of supporting the government.' The use of the
term 'months ahead' is not a slip.
One of the things the rebels want is the promise of a referendum before
Britain accepts any further European integration. Here Mr Major keeps the
door firmly open.
But first he insists on defining his broader attitude to Europe. Politicians
across the parties are divided into three groups. The first two are at the
extremes  - a minority that has never been reconciled to membership of the
European Union and an equally small number who want a centralised, federal
Europe.
Then there is the third group in which Mr Major places himself and the broad
mass of Conservatives. It does not question the economic advantages of
membership of the EU. But it is equally sure Britain should not sign up for
something just because it comes from Europe.
This majority group wants Britain to shape Europe in a way that fits its own
interests and instincts. As Mr Major puts it: 'I am as passionately opposed
to a wholly federal Europe as I would be to Britain losing its membership of
the European Union.'
So will he offer a referendum? Not for narrow party political reasons. But
yes, 'there conceivably could be reasons that would justify a referendum on
certain issues and I am not going to rule them out'.
Taking first the EU's Intergovernmental Conference planned for 1996, the
prime minister says the fears of the Eurosceptics are almost certainly
unfounded.
The outcome of a conference that has not yet started is inevitably
unpredictable. But: 'My strong suspicion is that we will see very little
change of any serious nature, certainly no serious constitutional change'.
The prime minister reinforces the point: 'I do not expect to come back with
anything that would require a referendum'.
But he admits he cannot be sure. Other EU leaders might bring more grandiose
ambitions to the conference table. So the referendum option will be held in
reserve.
The case for a plebiscite on a single currency is more clear cut. Economic
and monetary union would be a change of 'great national significance'. But
Mr Major believes the timetable is more distant and is slipping.
There is no question of eight EU countries meeting the Maastricht criteria
required for a single currency in 1997. Only three countries, the UK among
them, are likely to qualify. Theoretically, a core group might be ready to
go ahead two years later in 1999, but Mr Major is far from certain that such
a group would chose to, given the 'immensely divisive impact' on the EU. So
in Mr Major's terms: 'I cannot be certain no one will move ahead in 1999 but
I think those people who predict it with confidence are rather reckless in
their predictions.'
But as to the timing of any specific referendum pledge, Mr Major is keeping
his counsel.
Meanwhile, the cabinet will spend the next few months shaping Britain's
agenda for the 1996 conference. No plans have been finalised, but slimming
down the European Commission to cope with enlargement, the relationship
between national and the European parliaments and issues such as
subsidiarity and deregulation will be high on the agenda.
So too will be a strengthening of the intergovernmental structure
established at Maastricht, particularly in the area of security and foreign
policy. There can be no question of Britain surrendering any sovereignty
over its foreign policy, nor of any moves that would undercut the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).
But there is 'a range of areas where we can strengthen the European defence
identity, strengthen the European pillar of Nato and ensure that the
Europeans collectively make a greater contribution to the overall security'.
The discussion moves on to the economy, a source of both pride and
frustration for the prime minister. Mr Major  - like President Bill Clinton
in the US  - is presiding over a voteless recovery. Inflation is low, growth
and exports are buoyant, but there is still barely a hint of a political
payback.
Mr Major suggests the biggest obstacle to the return of confidence is that
unemployment hit a different sector of the community during the last
recession. 'The bruising has gone unusually deep.' Those in white-collar
professions such as financial services had previously been insulated from
downturns. This time, their next-door neighbours have been among the
victims.
More broadly: 'The economy is doing extremely well but people aren't' Annual
growth is running at 4 per cent but most individuals have not seen a rise in
their net disposable income.
The reason is that the vast bulk of the extra growth has been absorbed by
investment rather than by wages and dividends: 'That is very good for the
economy as a whole. It is very good for employment . . . but it doesn't
impact on the person who says, 'I see the politicians tell me the economy is
getting better, I don't feel any better off in my own lifestyle'.'
We put it to Mr Major that many in his party had a simple answer. Now that
borrowing was under control, the government could fill the voters' pockets
with tax cuts. Was Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, being altogether too
austere in his warnings about fiscal prudence?
The prime minister insists not. 'I am with the chancellor 100 per cent. We
are not going to engineer a pre-election boom. That is not the game we are
playing at all. Everyone has gone through a great deal of pain and a great
deal of difficulty to put this economy on an even keel . . . If anybody
thinks we will recklessly throw that away then they are making a very
serious misjudgement indeed.'
Tax cuts will come when the economic conditions are right: 'I do wish to put
taxes down, I do wish to give people choice but I am not going to do it
until it is economically right to do it'.
But what about those company directors who have engineered their own private
economic boom with hefty salary increases and share option packages? The
electorate, to judge by the opinion polls, is appalled. Is Mr Major going to
act?
Some of the increases, the prime minister agrees, have been 'insensitive'.
He welcomes moves in the City towards a greater degree of self-regulation.
He has held discussions on the issue with the Institute of Directors and the
National Association of Pension Funds.
But in legislative terms there is little he can do: 'The danger of
government taking legislative action of some sort is that you in practice
then impose a rather restricted pay policy upon a small number of people'.
His comments leave the impression that Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary and a fierce opponent of intervention, has prevailed in
the cabinet debate on the issue.
There is time just at the end of the interview to look ahead. To the
question whether he can remain prime minister until the end of the present
parliamentary term in mid-1997, Mr Major answers a simple 'Yes'. And he
intends to: 'You sometimes have to tack and trim to get from Dover to some
far distant port, but providing you get to the port a bit of tacking and a
bit of trimming en route doesn't matter'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank in command
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The German economy has confounded its critics in 1994; so has the
Bundesbank. It is difficult to see why the council should revise its
fundamental policies when setting the monetary target for 1995 this
Thursday. Nor is there a compelling reason for it to alter interest rates.
When the first change does come, it is more likely to be up than down.
It is remarkable how far and how quickly both the economic situation and the
problems confronting the Bundesbank have changed. A year ago, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast gross
domestic product growth of only 0.8 per cent between 1993 and 1994.
Meanwhile, as recently as April the annualised rate of growth of broad money
(M3), over the average for the last quarter of 1993, was 15.4 per cent, far
above the target range of 4-6 per cent.
With the economy forecast to stagnate and monetary growth soaring, the
Bundesbank was vulnerable to criticism whatever it did. If short-term
interest rates were lowered, it would be accused of ignoring the monetary
targets. If they were not, it would be accused of ignoring the needs of the
economy.
In the event, the Bundesbank did cut interest rates, lowering the discount
rate from 5 3/4 per cent to 5 1/4 per cent in February, to 5 per cent in
April and, finally, to 4 1/2 per cent in May. Similarly, the repurchase (or
'repo') rate was lowered from 6 per cent at the end of last year, to 4.85
per cent in late July, where it has since remained.
The justification given for cutting interest rates was not that the money
supply did not matter. Heaven forbid. It was rather that the money supply
was swollen by technical factors, including tax considerations and high
returns on liquid bank deposits relative to illiquid 'monetary capital'.
Vindicated
Considerable scepticism has been expressed about this rationale. In
retrospect, however, the Bundesbank has been vindicated. Since money supply
remained virtually unchanged between April and October, the growth of M3 is
now likely to be close to the upper range of its target for the year. If M3
were to remain stagnant in November and December, its annualised growth
would even fall within the range.
Money supply has come right  - and so has the economy. The expectation is
that GDP will grow by 2 1/2 per cent, or more, this year. Over the year to
the third quarter it rose 2.5 per cent. Growth has been driven, in the
traditional manner, by export volume, up 14 per cent in the year to June. As
a result, industrial output has also risen quite sharply. In October, it was
5.1 per cent above the level reached a year before, although it was still
6.3 per cent below its peak in early 1992. The east German economy is also
growing strongly, if from a low base: in the year to August 1994, output of
manufactures rose 19 per cent.
Inflation
Even though the economy has been recovering far more strongly than expected,
inflation has continued to fall. The annual rate of consumer price inflation
has been running at below 3 per cent since September. Yesterday's monthly
report from the Bundesbank said west German inflation could decline to below
2.5 per cent early next year. The report also welcomed the improvement in
the public sector deficit. Germany is, in fact, well on the way to meeting
the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union, by 1996.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank confronts the mirror image of the situation it
faced a year ago. Then the economy was weak and monetary growth strong. Now
things are the other way round. Nevertheless, the economy is not that strong
and and monetary growth is not that weak. The Bundesbank's instinct may well
be to change rather little.
The monetary target for next year is likely to be similar to the one for
1993, although that would imply upward drift in the base, above the
mid-point of this year's target range. Similarly, the Bundesbank should see
little reason to change interest rates. At some point next year, interest
rates are very likely to be raised. But the economy is not yet growing fast
enough  - in particular, consumption does not appear dynamic enough  - to
compel an early move. The Bundesbank deserves to feel proud of itself. It
should rest a while on its laurels.

FT  20 DEC 94 / On-line cafe society: Ronald van de Krol wanders through
Amsterdam's Digital City - The power of communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Far removed from the canals, bicycles and red light districts of Amsterdam,
thousands of Digital City residents are glued to their computer screens,
experiencing a life of lonesome sociability.
In a world of computer-based communication, they are meeting other computer
owners in electronic 'cafes', sending messages to mailboxes in the system's
'post office', or hovering in the 'main square', on the off-chance they
might meet someone interesting.
Amsterdam's Digital City was launched in January as a three-month project to
stimulate electronic communication and provide equal and widespread access
to information. But its sponsors, including the city and national
government, have been surprised by its popularity. The three-month timescale
has long since been abandoned, and the programme is about to take into
service a much bigger computer to handle a flood of 'immigrants'.
The city offers databanks, message groups and bulletin boards, similar to
those available on the global Internet system, but more compact and far less
daunting, and in Dutch, rather than English.
Residents can hook electronically into services, such as Urban Desires, a
computer basket described as an interactive magazine of metropolitan
passions. They can wander imaginary corridors, meeting fellow
metro-travellers, on their way to more than 100 metro stops created by local
computer buffs. Or they can drop in on one of the 'buildings' rented in the
para-city by organisations such as the Amsterdam tourist office, the Anne
Frank Foundation and the University of Amsterdam, to collect information or
ask questions.
Most residents enter the city from their offices or homes, using their own
computers, modems and telephones. But there are also tariff-free computer
terminals available at Amsterdam city hall, the public library and De Balie,
an avante-garde cafe that is the spiritual birthplace of the city.
Once in, users are greeted with messages declaring: 'You are the 1,757th
user today and the 45,341th this month.' This is an incentive for some, but
a deterrent for others. 'This city is becoming much too crowded,' complains
one computer resident after failing repeatedly to log on for lack of
available telephone and computer space.
To a first-time visitor, the city can be a bewildering fusion of high-tech
communication, old-fashioned chat and channel-surfing through television
channels by remote control. It is a bit like ham radio, except that the
voices have been replaced by words flashing by on the computer screen and
the crackle of radio frequency static has made way for the silent hum of the
computer-modem connection.
The city is populated by characters calling themselves 'Daydreamer', 'Nini'
and 'Tulip'. Much on-line 'talk' in the cafes is quick-paced but banal. For
example, one participant announces that he's just bought some croissants,
another types in 'yummy'.
By contrast, those taking part in electronic discussions about politics or
society are more high-minded. One heated exchange touched upon the
democratic credentials of those running the project and centres on the right
of the poor and those without computer equipment to take an active part in
'Amsterdam'.
Digital Amsterdam was launched to make computer communication a low-cost
reality for all citizens of the real Amsterdam, by providing access to the
network for the price of a local telephone call. However, the need for extra
cash has raised the possibility that commercial businesses will be
encouraged to rent 'buildings' in the city where they can ply their trade.
One objector to this proposal ends a digital outpouring with warnings of
totalitarianism and a parting shot from Voltaire: 'It's dangerous to be
right when the government is wrong.'
The Digital Citizens' Rights Movement of the Netherlands, contributes to the
on-line discussion about commercial sponsorship with a warning that
'governments and businesses must not be allowed to run the show'.
For others, even the price of a local phone call threatens to undermine the
birth of a true digital democracy. 'In Santa Monica, California, even the
homeless can take part in discussions on the local Freenet,' one Amsterdam
resident says.
A few hours in the city are enough to leave the reassuring ' if sometimes
depressing ' impression that people in the dawning world of virtual cities
and computer communication are ultimately very much like the people who once
sent messages by homing pigeons.
There is humour, intolerance, rudeness and honesty, in roughly equal
measure. There is also no lack of controversy.
Although firm figures are hard to come by, the regular residents estimate
that as many as 90 per cent of the city's inhabitants are men. They tend to
be aged between 15 and 30 and like to stay up late. As in the real
Amsterdam, the Digital City comes to life after 10pm.
Digital Amsterdam is also quite anonymous. You may be talking to a man who's
using a woman's name, or vice versa, and no one can tell. 'Often, an Astrid
is in reality a Willem,' says Hanneke Vermeulen, a systems operator of the
computer-based network.
This anonymity means that the Digital City-dweller need never be shy to
strike up a conversation with a stranger. At least in the beginning, people
in cyberspace can hide behind their fictitious names if they want, only
letting down their guard when they have developed a rapport with a new name
on the system.
Of course, there is no reason why two residents of Digital Amsterdam could
not arrange to meet at a real cafe in the real Amsterdam. But surprisingly,
perhaps, long-time residents say this does not happen often. 'It's easier
when you don't have to meet up face to face,' one regular at the computer
'pub' confesses. 'The person you've come to know through the screen can be
disappointing when he's sitting across from you.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Beckman's better times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr H L BENJAMIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To those who have been reluctantly bearish recently, but always looking
for a silver lining, hope springs from an unexpected quarter.
In a mostly well-reasoned article (In the Pink: 'Batten down for a bear to
beware', December 10), Bob Beckman writes '. . .it would not be unreasonable
to expect the bear market that began in February 1994 to be one of the
longest and deepest ever experienced'. I have been reading those of Bob
Beckman's market forecasts published in the press as long as he has been
making them and, so far as I can recall, they have invariably been wrong and
usually in spades.
I look forward to the future with (a tiny bit more) confidence.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: US fiscal policy irresponsible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN CALVERLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article, 'Evading US fiscal reality' (December 19), and
Michael Prowse's piece on the same page ('Why Bill signed Newt's contract')
correctly draw attention to the dangers of US tax cuts without commensurate
spending cuts and to the longer term problem of rising social security
spending. But even without these risks US fiscal policy looks irresponsible
because of the failure to use the current economic strength to reduce the
debit ratio.
Reaganomics took gross public debt from 38 per cent of gross domestic
product in 1980 to 53 per cent in 1989. The 1990 recession pushed it up
further to 64 per cent by end 1993. This year, with the benefit of GDP
growth at about 4 per cent, the ratio will fall, but only slightly. It will
not fall more because the structural budget deficit, that is after allowing
for economic cycle, has been allowed to continue at about 2.5 per cent of
GDP. When the US economy slows down over the next two years, as it must, the
ratio will inevitably start to rise again, even without any help from
unfunded tax cuts or the expected rise in social security spending.

FT  20 DEC 94 / When the centre does not hold: Russia's military action in
Chechnya threatens its own insecure democracy, says John Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin presents the Russian military intervention in
Chechnya as a simple affair. It is the taming of a rebellious republic that
is unequivocally a part of the Russian Federation.
General Dzhokar Dudayev's election as Chechen president in the autumn of
1991 was illegal; he has since declared an illegal independence; he has
ignored all Russian legislation; groups of paramilitaries have been armed
who have no right under Russian law to bear them; he has in the past few
weeks called his nation to war against Russia.
These acts are sufficient in any state to justify intervention. In Chechnya,
they are compounded by allegations of organised criminals freely operating
on Chechen territory, the diversion of vast amounts of oil, the non-payment
of any taxes, drugs smuggling, arms trading and civil strife.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, former deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal
Democratic Union, one of the few liberal politicians who supports Mr
Yeltsin's order to intervene, puts it more succinctly than the president has
yet managed to do: 'I look at it this way  - Chechnya is part of Russia: in
Chechnya the constitution and the laws of Russia are not enforced; in
Chechnya, for the past three years, illegal armed groups have threatened and
kill Russians. In the light of these facts, the central authorities must,
sooner or later, re-establish order.'
Most of Russia's liberal reformers and democrats have not seen it that way.
The two main liberal parties, Russia's Choice and Yabloko, are violently
against military action (though with some dissent among members).
Mr Yuri Kalmykov, the liberal-leaning Justice Minister  - himself from a
North Caucasian people, the Cherkessians  - resigned because of an early
disagreement with the course of policy towards Chechnya. Mr Leonid
Smiryagin, a presidential adviser, is also threatening resignation. Most of
the liberal press is against the president's policy (though there are splits
here too, dividing the newspapers).
These liberals do not, in the main, support Chechen independence: instead,
they fear for Russian democracy.
For Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of Russia's Choice; for Mr Grigory Yavlinsky,
leader of Yabloko; for Mr Otto Latsis, Russia's leading liberal columnist;
for Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma's (lower house) defence
committee, the threat is clear: it is of an authoritarianism that bases
itself on the need to prepare the country for war against its enemies.
Mr Yavlinsky, with a talent for the striking phrase, puts it thus: 'If the
country is drawn into a protracted war, the national-patriotic forces will
become the regime's natural base.'
Already Mr Yavlinsky's warning carries evident force. The major party in the
Duma supporting the president is Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist
Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Yeltsin is enjoying vocal support from old and
bitter foes from the days when he was seen as the leader of the democrats,
such as Mr Alexander Nevzorov, the rightwing nationalist TV star.
Increasing pressure is being put on the media  - whose approaches have been
diverse, in some instances courageous and probing over the Chechen affair  -
to conform. Pressure is especially strong on the independent NTV channel,
owned by the Most financial group whose head, Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, has
already been the target of a raid by Mr Yeltsin's private guards.
The dwindling band of radicals in the government met last Thursday to
discuss the progress of reform and, inevitably, Chechnya. It included Mr
Anatoly Chubais, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Sergei Vasiliev,
deputy economics minister.
While they oppose the intervention on political grounds, they also see it as
a disaster for the economic reform process. Rbs1,000bn has already been
promised to revive the republic's economy, and the cost of the military
operation is already running into the hundreds of billions of roubles. More
seriously, they fear that the military budget will almost certainly be
greatly increased as a reward to the army for fighting a dirty war in the
Caucasus.
Power has already drifted away from the parliament and ministers towards Mr
Yeltsin's bloated administration since his deliberate humiliation of the
cabinet after the crash of the rouble in November. It is now moving further
into the circle of ministers, aides and advisers who take a tough line on
Chechnya and much else.
Most of the important decisions are taken by the Security Council, which
liberal commentators routinely liken to the Communist party politburo that
ruled the former Soviet Union. It includes the ministers of defence and
interior affairs as well as the director of the Federal Intelligence
Committee. Its secretary, Mr Oleg Lobov, is a tough conservative close to Mr
Yeltsin for many years. The man Mr Yeltsin has chosen to be in day-to-day
charge of the Chechnya issue, Mr Nikolai Yegorov, a former chief
administrator of the Krasnodar region, is in a similar mould.
The liberal figures in the administration are isolated. Mr Chubais,
nominally joint number two in the cabinet, is fighting a lonely and
exhausting battle to keep economic reform on the rails and cannot involve
himself on Chechnya. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, chose to
resign from Russia's Choice when it criticised the president's policy on
Chechnya and has since defended it in forceful terms.
Mr Sergei Kovalev, Mr Yeltsin's special representative for human rights  -
who flew to Chechnya to negotiate with General Dudayev over the weekend at
the time when an attack was most likely  - has strongly criticised Mr
Yeltsin. With declining influence, he may soon have no job.
But it is not a simple matter of liberals against conservatives. The liberal
critics have been joined by military figures who do not have a liberal
reputation, such as General Boris Gromov, the last Soviet commander in
Afghanistan and deputy defence minister, and General Alexander Lebed, the
commander of the 14th Army in Transdnestria, the Russian-speaking part of
Moldova. On the ground in Chechnya, General Ivan Babichev, commander of a
motorised division, refused to advance to Grozny in the face of civilian
opposition.
TV interviews, including Russian ones, have presented officers and ordinary
soldiers openly questioning the need for the intervention and even
expressing their determination not to fight. But if the army begins to
divide over such issues, it may soon begin to take sides in Russia's
political quarrels.
Mr Fyodorov taunts his liberal colleagues with having nothing to suggest to
address the theat to the state's integrity that Chechnya presents. However,
the use of force could provoke a long and murderous anti-Russian war in
Chechnya and perhaps further afield  - with the Russians being seen as
anti-Moslem, the religion of most of the Chechens. With some 18m Moslems in
Russia, that would pose even greater threats to the country's territorial
integrity.
Mr Yeltsin, in moving to safeguard his state's integrity, has threatened it
further. He has made many mistakes: he moved very late; he shifted from
neglect of the situation to violent threats with nothing between; and he
clumsily sought to use the Chechen opposition as Russian proxies.
However, he and Russia may be facing an intractable problem  - that of a
member republic of the federation that in no circumstances will give up the
independence it claims. It is not yet clear what comes after force.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No time for doubt about India's
reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr K V RAJAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The sense of friendly concern about the future pace of India's economic
reforms evident in your editorial, 'India on trial' (December 15), is
understandable; but not, I submit, the note of pessimism about the possible
implications of recent state election results when you say: 'Reform will
stand still, while fiscal stabilisation starts to go backwards.'
By most yardsticks (foreign exchange availability, balance of payments,
inflow of direct as well as portfolio investment, liberalisation of the
trade and payments regime, convertibility on current account, exports,
industrial production) India's record since June 1991 should leave no room
for doubt that steady progress in the liberalisation programme will
continue. Of course, important challenges remain (labour laws, opening up of
the insurance sector, reform of banking, disinvestment), but, as Dr Manmohan
Singh, India's finance minister, suggested in an interview with the FT some
months ago ('We will surprise ourselves and the world,' March 30), there is
a need to avoid shock therapy if the delicate plant of liberalisation is to
be protected.
The Indian prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, and the finance minister
have repeatedly stressed that benefits of reform must reach the poor. As the
prime minister put it in his Guildhall speech in March, if the poorest
sections of the population are left behind, it would lead to disaster. The
recent state election results might be seen by some as reinforcing the logic
of that concern, across the political spectrum. But this will only
strengthen the consensus about the need for rapid economic growth across a
broad front, not weaken it.
The international community, which demonstrated such robust confidence in
India's economic reforms at extremely difficult times in 1991, perhaps owes
itself not to indulge in doubt and concern now, when neither is warranted.

Sir, On reading Joe Rogaly's article, 'Down with the lottery]' (December

I believe that the answer is 'simple'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Very strange Morgan Stanley-Warburg
talks could have got so far
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES PUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Apropos your article, 'Warburg merger plan called off' (December 16),
note 7 to rule 9 of the Takeover Code contains something called the 'chain
principle' which deals with what happens when one party obtains control of a
company and thereby control of a second company because the acquired company
itself holds a controlling block of shares in the second company.
This note states that the Takeover Panel will not normally require an offer
to be made for the second company under this rule unless either: the
shareholding in the second company constitutes a substantial part of the
assets of the first company; or one of the main purposes of acquiring
control of the first company was to secure control of the second company.
In the case of the Morgan Stanley-Warburg merger, and the controlling stake
held by Warburg in MAM, it would appear that both these conditions are
fulfilled. No-one could argue that MAM does not represent a substantial part
of the assets of Warburg, and you reported on your front page Mr Stephen
Waters, co-managing director of Morgan Stanley Europe, as saying: 'MAM was
the reason for us to do the deal.'
It therefore seems fairly clear that the rules of the Takeover Code mean
that a mandatory offer for the minority shareholding in MAM was always going
to the required.
Against this background it seems very strange that negotiations between
Morgan Stanley and Warburg could have got as far as they did when the
(premature) announcement was made of bid talks without independent advisers
to MAM having already been brought in to the deal with this potential
show-stopper at a far earlier stage.

Christmas is already influencing scheduling trends: old films, a quiz and
ancient comedy are in evidence tonight. Among the oldies I would happily
plump for the repeated Only Fools and Horses (8.30 BBC1) above the others.
Not quite Christmassy is Sex in a Cold Climate (9.00 C4). No, not a
permissive update of Nancy Mitford but a documentary on Ann Summers, the sex
shops I fondly imagined run by a liberated Hampstead-dweller in a Laura
Ashley smock. The chain is actually owned by a group whose interests include
porn mags, which adds a sinister edge to the shots of housewives shrieking
at jolly sex-aids selling parties. Whatever happened to Tupperware? Don't
answer - they have probably found an unmentionable use for that as well.
Is tonight the last pre-Christmas sex (sorry, adult programme) binge? The
Ballad of Nicky Mouse (12 midnight C4) is not quite unmentionable, merely
unspeakable. Homosexuality in prison inspired the Jean Genet film Un Chant
d'amour but this pretentious drivel is not, emphatically not, it.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Haitink and the LPO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For fans of the London Philharmonic Orchestra the most likely question on
everyone's lips at the moment is 'who will succeed Franz Welser-Most as
music director?', a matter of even greater urgency now that Klaus Tennstedt,
the LPO's principal guest conductor, has had to retire from conducting due
to the ill health that has constantly dogged his career.
One possible contender for the post is surely the present music director of
the Royal Opera, Bernard Haitink. His long and fruitful association with
Amsterdam's legendary Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, his musical
directorship of Glyndebourne Festival Opera and his special relationship
with the Vienna Philharmonic certainly single him out as a strong candidate
for the LPO job, though whether his current position as the LPO's president
will disqualify him remains to be seen. If he is to be considered, then the
two concerts he gave with the orchestra on Sunday and Thursday might be
viewed as something of a public audition.
The tidy account of Beethoven's First Symphony which began Sunday's concert
was a good example of Haitink at his best: neat and precise, free of
interpretive quirks, it gave the impression of playing itself. Short of wit,
maybe, but handled with an attractive lightness of touch. It was, in short,
a pleasantly unassuming reading, a quality less welcome in the Ninth
Symphony, where the interpretative challenges are so much greater and the
weight of performance tradition so much more intimidating.
Given Haitink's operatic experience, one might have expected a view of the
Ninth riven with dramatic incident shot through with a palpable regard for
its summatory, colossean dimensions. In the event, the bold rhetoric of the
first movement seemed less than arresting, and the finale, for all the
vigorous contribution of a well drilled LPO choir and the reliable team of
soloists  - Karita Mattila, Ann Murray, Keith Lewis and Robert Lloyd  - was
devoid of visionary ecstasy. Haitink was visibly exhausted at the end of it.
And the packed Festival Hall audience vociferous in its appreciation. Just
quite why was difficult to fathom.
Thursday's concert showed Haitink on top form, however, not so much in a
brash account of Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini overture and a rather subdued
Ravel Mother Goose, but in a finely controlled and numinous reading of
Vaughan William's Fifth Symphony. Haitink and the LPO are no strangers to
VW. Their recordings for EMI of the First, Second and Seventh Symphonies
have been enthusiastically received, further proof that VW is not the
exclusive property of British artists, as conductors of the calibre of
Rostropovich, Rozhdestvensky and Slatkin have triumphantly demonstrated. The
Fifth, in particular, is well suited to Haitink's introspective temperament,
but what impressed above all was his feeling for the longer line, his
ability to inject a strong sense of purpose to the ambiguous, ruminative
nature on much of the music without robbing it of its sense of wonder. With
more performances like this and a more carefully chosen repertoire, Haitink
could, perhaps, be just the music director the LPO so badly needs.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Freud among the big boys - William Packer admires the
brave juxtaposition of old and new at the Dulwich Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dulwich Picture Gallery holds one of London's more remarkable smaller
collections of old masters. For its size it is extraordinarily rich not
merely in the nominal range of the masters it represents, but in the prime
quality of the works by which it represents them. Furthermore, it is kept
and shown in the most perfect of galleries, built to the purpose by John
Soane and a masterpiece in itself.
Needless to say, being so special a national treasure, it has been kept on
short commons for decades, sometimes even under threat of closure. That
said, it seems at present in fairly rude health, largely by virtue of the
energetic fund-raising policies of its present director, Giles Waterfield,
and his imaginative programme of temporary exhibitions, which from time to
time brings in the work of modern and contemporary artists such as Lucian
Freud, whose work is currently on show.
But then although many old-master galleries put on shows of modern art from
time to time, even though not always by artists so celebrated as Lucian
Freud, nor necessarily with the work of Velasquez, Poussin, Gainsborough,
Tiepolo, Watteau, Canaletto and Van Dyck on the wall next door. Such a show,
we would assume, would be set aside in a room to itself, a special case with
critical values of its own by which to respond to it.
What makes all the difference here, however, is that Waterfield 'thought it
would be interesting to hang the (Freuds) among the many mainly 17th century
Flemish paintings in one of Soane's main galleries.' And he knew very well,
for all his mock-innocence, that by so doing he would be taking a most
radical curatorial step.
He had four new Freuds at his disposal, three nudes of which two were very
large, and a small study of a woman's head. And the wall he chose for them,
in the first gallery on the left on the main axis of the gallery, is not
full of any old things. It is commanded by the great Rubens, lately
restored, of 'Venus, Mars and Cupid', with Lely's 'Nymphs at a fountain' and
a Van Huysum flower piece alongside, and Van Dyck and Hobbema, among others,
across the room.
One of the heresies of modernism, and one of the most pernicious, is that it
represents a break with the great humanist tradition of Western Europe that
goes back through the renaissance to classical times. Yet it has remained an
evident truth, at least to those collectors with the wit and confidence to
trust their eyes, that no hermetic seal ever came down to cut us off from
the past. We may know a work of art, of whatever kind, by the company it
keeps; and if it is good enough it will hold its place in the grandest
company, by uality alone.
But it is a stiff test, and to set up Lucian Freud against Rubens of all
people, could all too easily be written off as mere curatorial affectation
and no contest at all. But Freud at least has never felt himself to be cut
off from the great tradition  - artists by and large don't  - and for the
last 20 years or so has openly set himself by its standards, not just in the
intensity of his scrutiny of the visible world, but in the physical scale of
his pictorial ambition, and his prodigious output. He is now 72, and on this
present evidence is working with as much physical control and energy as
ever, if not more. The huge standing male nude, 'Leigh under the skylight',
seen full frontal and foreshortened from below, is an astonishing practical
achievement in itself.
That it should also declare itself as a great work of art is something else
again. Many still find Freud's bleak vision of humanity unnerving and
objectionable, but then the manifest fleshiness of Rubens' women is
notoriously not to everyone's taste. The direct comparison here between
Freud and Rubens is uncanny and revealing. Of course there must be
differences  - the history of art cannot be undone, and in Freud the legacy
of expressionism is clear enough. But yet these two artists speak to each
other across the centuries on equal terms, on the same scale, even in the
same way  - the crossed feet of Freud's Leigh and Rubens' Venus is the
nicest coincidence. But then how closely similar is the drawing of those
feet, in the working of the pigment on the surface, the openness and
directness of the statement. The innate naturalism of each image bespeaks a
deep and natural sympathy, for all that one is an allegory, the other
supposedly an objective response to the natural world.
But then all art is allegory, in the sense that all art is art, and removed
from the world through the sensibility and imagination of the artist. Here
are two great artists seen for once side by side, with other great artists
looking on. We can do no more than pay Lucian Freud the compliment of saying
that his work looks as though it has lived in such company all along.
Lucian Freud at Dulwich: The Dulwich Picture Gallery, College Road SE21,

FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Oberto - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In many performances John Tomlinson gives the impression of a
larger-than-life character in search of a role that is big enough for him.
With the title role of Verdi's Oberto he has undeniably found one of the
right size, but that has not stopped him being doubly ambitious and taking
on not one role, but two.
Last Thursday Tomlinson also made his debut as an opera producer. When Opera
North decided to put on a production of Verdi's first opera, it originally
turned to Ian Judge, but he started to get cold feet and withdrew. Tim
Albery was approached and thought better of the opera, but decided against
it. Enter Tomlinson, laying aside his Wagnerian spear and seizing instead a
sword with which to champion this early Verdi rarity.
His production is sketched with bold outlines, but not much in between - a
bit like the opera, really. He has set it in the Italy of the 1920s, the
ominous menace of dictatorship already casting a premature shadow. The
chosen period may make the story even less credible than before, but it is a
gift for the ladies of the chorus, who glitter in the party scenes as
flappers with beads, plumed headdresses and long cigarette-holders  - the
full works.
As a whole, the show looks good, thanks to Russell Craig's effective
designs, but in early Verdi neither that, nor clever production ideas, will
ever make the evening. Oberto depends on singers who can fire the
imagination and at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, it had three out of four.
Tomlinson throws himself into his role, giving it every ounce of his energy
and decibels from the moment he comes on. Some light and shade would be
welcome, but single-handedly he galvanises the whole performance.
The sparks fly when he is confronted with Linda Finnie's hyperventilating
Cuniza. Heaven knows who gave her that awful wig (one imagines her worst
enemy ironing the pleats in the dressing-room beforehand) but she makes an
ace twenties' vamp, generously throwing around her ample, rather Wagnerian
mezzo. David Maxwell Anderson had an apology made from the stage for a cold,
but sang with promising clarity; only the lyrical writing strained his
resources.
With David Porcelijn keeping the impetus going (crucial in early Verdi) the
musical performance had most of the rude energy it needs. Only Rita Cullis
in the soprano role of Leonora was too polite, lacking the necessary punch
in the middle of the voice. Although she gave all she had, her final aria,
which is the climax of the evening, was a vocal firework display which went
off without any eclat. Incidentally, how striking it is to hear the pre-echo
of Rigoletto in her duet with her father.
Why is Oberto worth seeing? First, for historical reasons, because it is the
seed from which all the later Verdi masterpieces grew. Second, for the sheer
adrenalin, which will set toes tapping and hearts pumping, even when the
brain complains that the music is not good enough to support any serious
emotions at all. Opera North has found its energy and to that extent has
found the opera, too.
On tour until March

FT  20 DEC 94 / Technology: A good deal for the unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unison, Britain's biggest trade union, has developed a software system that
will help union negotiators deal with decentralised bargaining across the
public services.
By using a mixture of electronic communications and databases, negotiators
can now receive support and data wherever they are working.
The union spent Pounds 300,000 this year on developing a software package,
Local Negotiator, which it is offering to its 2,500 branches. It includes a
claim calculator for use in preparations for bargaining and during
negotiations.
By entering some basic figures, negotiators can see what the effect of a pay
claim or offer will be on members or on the employer's pay bill. A welfare
rights package enables negotiators to calculate the effect of pay increases
for members claiming benefit.
Alan Jinkinson, general secretary, said: 'Negotiators in the field,
activists or staff can prepare claims, assess management offers and send
information back to head office within seconds. We are leading the trade
union movement in these developments, and are ahead of public service
management in many areas.'
A bargaining support project depends on the exchange of current information,
which branches can join by subscribing to Poptel, a non-commercial
telecommunications system. Members can also access and contribute to union
bulletin boards.
Unison estimates that about half its branches already have a personal
computer. Some 140 branches are testing the software, of which 30 are fully
on line.
In common with all other UK unions, Unison has undertaken a campaign to sign
up its 1.3m members to pay their union subscriptions by employer's check-off
from their salaries, and has so far signed up 92 per cent.
Jinkinson said: 'Once all the sign-up information from the regions is
entered on to our central computerised membership system, we shall be able
to make substantial savings on direct mailing costs and target our
membership in terms of particular surveys, one-off initiatives and
longer-running campaigns.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / Technology: Aluminium can makers think small - Kenneth
Gooding on moves to reduce manufacturing costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kaiser Aluminium, part of the Maxxam Group of the US, says it has developed
a 'micro mill' process that could substantially reduce capital and operating
costs for producing can sheet, an aluminium alloy from which beverage cans
are made.
Kaiser says the capital cost would be Dollars 25m (Pounds 15.2m) to Dollars
30m for a micro mill with an annual capacity of 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes. It
also claims that the cost of converting metal into sheet is only half that
of a conventional mill.
'This size of mill would be ideal in developing can markets,' says Dick
Evans, Kaiser's corporate vice-president, flat rolled products. 'It could
provide stock for two can-making plants which could be close by. It would be
easier to raise the capital and it would avoid the heavy cost of
transporting can stock from the US, Japan or Europe.'
Can sheet, or can stock, is produced mainly in large plants costing from
Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn and equipped to produce 225,000 to 500,000
tonnes of can sheet a year. Separately, Golden Aluminium, which makes cans
for Adolph Coors brewing group of the US, has tried in the past two years to
convince the industry that 'mini mills', which produce the material on a
small scale, will work. Mini mills need less capital and therefore do not
have to produce such large quantities of can sheet to be viable. Golden's
new mill at San Antonio, Texas, has the capacity to produce an annual 90,000
tonnes of can stock and the capital cost was Dollars 168m.
To achieve cost savings, both Golden and Kaiser have moved to a different
method of producing can sheet. The most expensive part of the conventional
process is hot rolling, which rolls the metal until it is the required
thickness. Each hot mill costs Dollars 15m to Dollars 25m. To eliminate the
need for the big aluminium slabs and hot rolling, Golden and Kaiser employ
continuous casting techniques. This involves molten metal, adjusted to the
right composition, being poured into a holding box with a chilled mould down
one side. Metal is poured continuously into the mould, as it is propelled
along by a moving belt, to produce a thin slab already the width needed by
the cold mill and only 3mm thick. The metal flows on to cold rolling where
mills are placed in tandem (three or four in a line) to save space.
The metal is rolled through these mills instead of moving backwards and
forwards in a reversing mill in the conventional process.
There are drawbacks, however. Only certain alloys are suitable for
continuous casting. Also, some competitors have raised questions about the
surface finish  - soft drinks companies require a sparkling surface to the
cans they use. There are questions, too, about the Golden Aluminium process.
'Golden claimed great things during construction of its mill but the
start-up has been costly and long. So many observers are sceptical,' says
Nick Mason at the CRU International consultancy.
Golden admits start-up costs so far at its San Antonio mill are Dollars
35.8m. However, it is producing 7bn cans a year and has an outside customer
in Reynolds Metals, the second-largest US aluminium group. Golden says the
project needs only one more customer to become viable.
Kaiser says it will have spent Dollars 20m on its micro mill project by the
middle of 1995. By late 1995 it hopes to have started on a micro mill in the
US.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Technology: Calluna's future on the cards - James Buxton
reports on how a Scottish disc drive maker plans to conquer the world market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a pressurised cleanroom inside the Scottish plant of the electronics
company Calluna, men and women wearing pale blue suits and white masks which
leave only their eyes showing are assembling delicate miniature hard disc
drives. They look like astronauts inside a space station.
Their goal is to make Calluna a world leader in the market for 1.8in hard
disc drives, products that cover no more than the area of a credit card.
Calluna was formed in late 1991. After three traumatic years surviving on a
tiny amount of capital, it raised Pounds 10m on the London Unlisted
Securities Market in late October. It now has a market capitalisation of
Pounds 50m and the resources to expand.
Calluna's 1.8in disc drives, which it calls Callunacards, stand only 10.5mm
high. They can be installed as an embedded component of a notebook computer,
but more importantly they also come in a portable version that can be
inserted in and removed from any PC that has an expansion slot conforming to
the standard set by the Personal Computer Memory Card International
Association (PCMCIA).
PCMCIA slots, now being installed in many new notebook PCs, are widely seen
as the gateway to a new method of moving data between PCs  - transferring an
entire credit card-sized disc drive which would either be the PC's main
drive or a supplementary one.
The new 1.8in drives have very high storage capacity for their size  -
Callunacards, for example, range from 70MB to the recently launched 260MB
product, the biggest in its category. But they need it: hard disc drives are
becoming bigger as software companies produce programs that are ever
hungrier for storage space (Microsoft's Windows Office needs about 82MB for
the program alone).
Norman White, Calluna's founder and managing director, envisages that one
day travelling PC users will carry only their 1.8in disc drives with them,
slotting them into a host PC when they need to work on their data. 'This is
the floppy disc of the future,' he says. 'The personal element in personal
computing will become the portable disc drive.'
There are also openings for Calluna's products for non-computer use. A
company in Spain is developing a 'speech integrator' using the Callunacard
from which visitors to museums and tourist attractions will hear
commentaries in different languages. The miniature drives can also be used
to store and transport the recordings of security video cameras.
White was a founder and technical director of Rodime, the Scottish disc
drive company which in 1983 produced the world's first 3.5-in hard disc
drive. But Rodime made a series of strategic blunders and ceased
manufacturing in 1991. It now lives by licensing its past know-how.
All Calluna's senior executives worked for Rodime, making the new company
Rodime's technological heir. 'These people have been around the business for
a long time,' says Bob Katsive of Disc/Trend, the San Francisco-based market
research company.
The team has succeeded in building up Calluna and developing innovative
products despite having raised only Pounds 5m in venture capital, plus
grants, before the flotation  - money was so short at times that the 40
staff had to take salary cuts.
Calluna's disc drive components are made and tested to its specifications by
suppliers in East Asia, England and California. They are then assembled in
Calluna's plant at Glenrothes in Fife.
It has established relationships with computer manufacturers in the US and
Europe which have confirmed the compatibility of its products. In Europe it
has a network of specialist distributors, while in the US a company rebadges
Calluna's products for sale under its own label.
So far Calluna's biggest orders have been for two consignments of 2,500
units each for distributors in the US and the UK. The order book is growing,
though the 25,000 sq ft plant is tooled up to produce 50,000 drives a year
and could ultimately be expanded to make 450,000 annually.
Despite its technological prowess Calluna faces awesome challenges, as the
two pages of risk factors listed in its flotation prospectus attest.
Its strategy has three elements. First, White says, it needs always to be at
the leading edge of disc drive technology. As a small company it cannot
compete with larger disc drive makers on price in high volume manufacturing.
Instead it must use its engineering expertise continually to incorporate
more storage capacity on to its drives. White envisages Calluna developing a
miniature 500MB drive by 1997 and later progressing to 1,000MB.
Second, however, it still needs to develop a good level of business with
original equipment manufacturers in the PC industry making less powerful
drives, even though margins here are not very attractive. It could later
license or sub-contract this part of its out-put.
Producing in some volume will enable Calluna to buy components more cheaply
to develop the third leg of its business, the higher margin business of
making removable PCMCIA drives which could be sold by dealers direct to the
consumer.
However the market for 1.8in drives is still in its infancy. Disc/Trend
forecasts that as more notebook PCs are manufactured with PCMCIA slots, the
number of PCMCIA disc drives shipped worldwide will rise from 360,000 this
year to more than 4.3m in 1997.
But this forecast and others by Dataquest have yet to be confirmed by
reality and White says the market for removable drives is still moving
forward slowly, though that for embedded drives is growing faster.
Only three competitors, the US companies Maxtor, a long-established disc
drive maker, and two recent start-ups, Integral and MiniStor, have products
in the same category as Calluna. However, Katsive believes bigger
manufacturers such as Seagate, Conner, NEC and Hitachi which had earlier
dabbled in the 1.8in drive market will return to the market as demand
improves, possibly late next year.
Katsive says survival for independents like Calluna depends on staying ahead
of the giants. 'It will have to be fleet of foot,' he says.

David Brewer, finance director of British Coal, is to become boss of Mining
(Scotland), the consortium of private sector investors and unions which is
the government's preferred bidder for the Scottish coalfield.
Brewer's title will be operations and financial director. The present chief
executive officer is Brian MacDonald, a Scottish businessman and company
doctor, but it was always made clear that MacDonald would step aside and
recruit a ceo from the coal industry once he had steered the consortium's
bid to a successful conclusion.
Brewer, 48, has been with British Coal since 1968 and has held a number of
senior financial posts, as well as being involved in the privatisation

FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Betterware looks to better itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Betterware, the direct home-shopping group, announced a number of board
changes yesterday to try to boost its flagging share price.
Peter Hartley, the former managing director of Texas Homecare who joined
Betterware in December last year, has been promoted to group managing
director from group financial director.
Andrew Cohen has moved from the post of chief executive to be executive
chairman.
Hartley will be based permanently at the group's Birmingham headquarters and
distribution centre; Cohen was previously in charge of operations but only
spent three days a week in Birmingham. Now, he will concentrate on the
group's strategy, especially the development of Betterware's new partnership
with Avon in north and south America.
Paul Turner, currently financial director of Betterware UK, becomes group
financial controller; the board has not yet decided whether to appoint him
permanently as group financial director.
Walter Goldsmith has retired as non-executive chairman but remains on the
board and will continue to chair the audit and remuneration committee.
Betterware has fallen out of favour in the City this year. Its shares have
dropped from a peak of 278p in July last year to 44p yesterday.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: City thefts take the biscuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GILLIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City law firms are facing a chocolate biscuit crisis.
Pilfering by staff of biscuits destined for client meetings is forcing city
firms to take drastic action.
Simmons &amp; Simmons has saved between Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 20,000 a year
by forbidding staff, even heads of department, to eat chocolate biscuits
during meetings with clients.
At Clifford Chance, a member of staff was given a formal reprimand recently
after issuing more than the permitted two chocolate biscuits per guest.
Clyde &amp; Co initially switched from four-finger to two-finger Kit Kats, but
has now gone further
by offering only Cadbury's Snacks.
Senior partner Michael Payton says the savings were 'considerable, mainly
because we have been able to sack the half of the personnel department who
were dealing with nothing but complaints about biscuits'.
At DJ Freeman, biscuit costs have proved difficult to control because of a
form of the small boys' custom of 'scrumping' in apple orchards, known as
'hoovering'. Staff loiter until conference rooms are empty, then dart in and
fill their pockets.
Senior partner David Solomon says it was hard to combat because 'suspects
include lawyers at the most senior levels'.
The crisis has led firms to incorporate biscuits in negotiating tactics. At
Freshfields, Manchester Airport Enquiry meetings were speeded up by awarding
a chocolate biscuit to whoever made a point on which all parties could
agree.
Procedures elsewhere in the country vary. In Yorkshire, the duty of
hospitality is taken very seriously. At the Sheffield office of Oxley &amp;
Coward, a heaped plate of Cadbury's Shapes is put on the table when meetings
begin, and replenished when empty.
This adds an extra dimension to the threat of competition from regional law
firms.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Justice seeks its price - Robert Rice
on the arguments over curbing legal aid in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's response to the soaring legal aid bill of the 1980s was to
cut back on the numbers eligible for financial assistance, curb lawyers'
pay, impose standard fees for criminal cases and introduce legal aid
franchising.
The medicine was hard for lawyers to take, but appears to have worked. Legal
aid expenditure is no longer rising at a rate of almost 30 per cent a year.
The increases in the past two years have been below 10 per cent. Future
rates of increase will be even lower.
The eligibility cuts were particularly successful. The government reduced
financial eligibility for legal aid in April 1993 so that people with
incomes above the level of income support would no longer qualify for free
legal advice and would have to pay a much larger contribution towards the
cost of legal aid. The government estimated the cuts would save Pounds 43m
in 1993-94, Pounds 110m in 1994-95 and Pounds 173m in 1995-96. Having made
the cuts it expected total expenditure to reach Pounds 1.54bn in 1995-96.
In fact, legal aid expenditure in 1993-94 was some Pounds 73m less than
provided for in the supply estimates. Expenditure in the current year is
also expected to be underspent by at least Pounds 70m. As a result, the
government has reduced the provision for the next two years by more than
Pounds 70m in each year. Expenditure is now expected to rise to Pounds 1.6bn
in 1997-98, just 4 per cent more than the original estimate for 1995-96.
Given the apparent success in holding back legal aid expenditure, the Law
Society, the solicitors' governing body, has argued the government could now
afford to relax its grip slightly.
But rather than restoring the eligibility cuts  - something Lord Mackay, the
Lord Chancellor, promised he would do as soon as it became feasible  - the
government seems intent on further tight-ening control of the legal aid
bill.
Next spring Lord Mackay will publish a green paper outlining plans to make
legal aid a cash-limited scheme controlled by 'fundholders for justice'
along similar lines to the GP fundholders system.
The idea was first mooted in July in a paper by the Social Market
Foundation, a right-wing think tank.
The paper was written by three members of the advisory group assisting the
Treasury fundamental review of the expenditure of the Lord Chancellor's
department, part of the purpose of which was to examine access to publicly
funded legal services and the options for ensuring funding is provided in as
cost-effective a way as possible. The paper proposed establishing a system
of fundholders who would control the funding of legal aid in a particular
area.
At present, those needing legal aid first approach a solicitor who applies
for legal aid on their behalf, either to the court, for criminal legal aid,
or to the Legal Aid Board, for civil legal aid. They then assess whether the
case merits legal aid. Those who qualify are offered legal aid so long as
they also meet the financial eligibility requirements and pay any
contribution which may be ordered.
Under the proposed fundholder scheme, the fundholder would be the first
point of contact. Fundholders would determine what services people required
and seek the most cost-effective means of providing them. They would have a
limited budget at their disposal. The idea was well received by the
government.
The Law Society is up in arms, however. It says the Social Market
Foundation's analysis of expenditure trends is out of date; its economic
analysis of the way legal aid operates ignores fundamental features of the
legal aid system; and the fundholder scheme would turn legal aid into a
lottery.
Mr Charles Elly, Law Society president, says: 'Cash-limiting would mean that
whether you got legal aid depended on where you lived and when you applied,
rather than on the needs of your case. What is worse, it could mean legal
aid would be cut off from cases involving a challenge to the government.'
The society acknowledges legal aid expenditure rose very rapidly in the
1980s, doubling in real terms since 1987-88, while total government
expenditure increased by only 14 per cent.
But it says many of the factors behind the increase reflect deliberate
government policy. Among these were:
The creation of a statutory duty solicitor scheme to provide advice at
police stations. That cost Pounds 66m in 1993-94.
A rise in the number of expensive serious fraud trials. The estimated cost
to the legal aid fund of the failed prosecution of Mr George Walker, former
head of Brent Walker, is Pounds 5m.
Increased public awareness of available legal remedies.
More generous legal aid for children.
The success of the green form scheme under which people receive free initial
advice on a legal problem.
At the same time, the society says, the average costs of cases also rose.
This was partly because cases took longer to prepare thoroughly. Solicitors
had to consider such things as advance disclosure of prosecution statements
in criminal cases, while in civil cases the increased burden of discovery of
documents and the greater use of expert witnesses drove costs up. Moreover,
there was also a significant increase in the hourly rates paid in civil
cases as county courts increasingly allowed realistic fee rates following a
High Court ruling on the matter.
The society also say the foundation's economic analysis of legal aid was
wrong. The foundation argued legal aid was subject to 'supplier induced
demand'  - services were delivered because lawyers wished to provide them
rather than because clients needed them. But that analysis ignored the
controls on the grant of legal aid and lawyers costs exercised by the courts
and the Legal Aid Board, the society says.
Its main objection to the fundholder scheme is that cash-limiting would
change legal aid from a service to which all those who meet the qualifying
conditions are entitled into a discretionary benefit. That would defeat the
purpose of legal aid, which is to enable criminal trials to be conducted
fairly and to enable the government to meet its responsibility for ensuring
access to justice in civil disputes. Cash-limiting, it argues, would mean
the legal aid scheme operated inconsistently in different parts of the
country, and at different times of the year, as the money ran out more
quickly in some areas than others.
It would also enable the government to make covert cuts simply by
underfunding the service rather than having to bring regulations before
parliament whenever it wanted to change the scheme. Legal aid for challenges
to the government could be cut under the guise of giving priority to bread
and butter cases.
The legal profession recognises that it must live with a tighter legal aid
budget in future. The Labour party has made it as clear as have the
Conservatives that there will be little additional funding for legal aid.
But with legal aid expenditure now under control the case for the draconian
measures suggested by the Social Market Foundation has not been made, the
society says.
A better approach would be to make the justice system itself more
affordable. The Lord Chancellor has appointed Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, to
review the civil justice system. Solicitors believe Lord Mackay should wait
until Lord Woolf reports before taking action which, although popular with
the Treasury, would not promote good and open public administration.

FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Jillings' initiative for Wales
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Godfrey Jillings, who headed up Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for
independent financial advisers, is taking over as director of Wales'
Financial Services Initiative.
The initiative seeks to lure financial services businesses to Cardiff and
south-east Wales. Jillings, who spent 32 years with National Westminster
Bank, was chief executive of Fimbra for three years before it was superseded
this autumn by the Personal Investment Authority.
Jillings, an Englishman, will have the job of giving a fresh boost to the
initiative, which was launched in 1988 but has been rather quiescent during
the recession. In particular, he will seek to target potential relocators
from London and the south-east.
The initiative, which has a London office and an annual budget of Pounds
250,000, is run as a partnership by the Welsh Development Agency, Cardiff
city council, Cardiff Bay development corporation, South Glamorgan county
council and Newport borough council.
According to Gregory Byrne, its chairman, the partners are 'determined that,
as the economy recovers, the initiative will be back in the business of
pulling jobs into Wales'.
The Welsh Development Agency itself has a new board member, Robin Lewis. He
is chairman and managing director of Magstim Company, which makes medical
instruments at Whitland, Dyfed. Making the appointment, John Redwood, Welsh
secretary, said Lewis had considerable experience of running a small company
in a rural location. 'I want to see many more such companies.'

<TEXT>
Shares of Huntingdon International Holdings jumped 11p to 31p yesterday as
the life sciences group announced that Roger Pinnington was its choice as
chairman to succeed Ian Campbell, who gave notice of his intention to resign
in mid-August.
Last Friday, shares of HIH tumbled 23p to 20p as the group revealed a plunge
from profits of Pounds 8.68m to pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.1m, after
exceptional charges of Pounds 70.8m to cover restructuring costs at HEE, the
US engineering and environmental services business, and the placing into
administration of Travers Morgan, the UK-based consultancy.
Known as a 'company doctor', Pinnington, 62, has been chief executive of UBM
Group, Royal Ordnance, RHP Group, Telfos (after the aborted takeover bid by
William Cook), and Blackwood Hodge (until its takeover by BM Group).
More recently he has worked with multinational leasing companies,
institutional and private investors, clearing banks and venture capitalists,
including recovery and reconstruction situations.
Currently he is chairman of Lynx Holdings, Cortworth and British World
Aviation.

Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, has realigned roles at
the top of its foods business. It has moved from a geographic to a product
split. The changes bring the business closer to the structure of other
Unilever operations such as detergents. Unilever says the continuing
integration of European food markets and its own global food ambitions
triggered the changes. Foods accounted for Pounds 14.3bn of Unilever's
Pounds 27.9bn turnover in 1993.
Jan Peelen takes responsibility for global strategy in tea, tea-based
beverages and a new culinary products portfolio. He remains chairman of the
foods executive and head of the US food operations.
Anthony Burgmans will head ice cream and frozen food operations in Europe
and be responsible for the global strategy for those products. He was head
of southern European foods.
Okko Muller will head all other European foods and be responsible for global
strategy of bakery, oil and dairy-based products. He was head of northern
European foods.

FT  20 DEC 94 / People: Inntrepreneurs lose out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent loss by Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and foods group, of the
management contract of Inntrepreneur Estates, the UK pub joint venture
between Grand Met and Foster's Brewing of Australia, has left some 15 senior
managers without jobs.
The rest of the 280 staff of Grand Metropolitan Estates, the subsidiary
running IEL, will transfer to IEL which is to have its own management
reporting to the two shareholders, Grand Met and Courage, the UK brewing
subsidiary of Foster's.
The three most senior departees from Grand Met Estates are: Robert Williams,
chairman and managing director, Peter Coleman, director of legal affairs and
company secretary, Mike Newman, pubic relations director, and Bill Fox,
Rodney Mann and John Norris, who are three of the regional managers.
Grand Met had managed IEL since the two partners pooled their pubs in 1991.
It has been criticised by publicans, lobby groups and politicians for
running Inntrepreneur more like a property company than a pub business. Some
licensees have campaigned through the courts against the terms of their
leases.
Courage, chaired by Michael Foster, was thought to have been dissatisfied
with the management arrangement. When the joint venture was refinanced again
in November, Grand Met relinquished its management role.
IEL is seeking a chief executive and several other senior managers. Although
IEL will run independently, Courage is planning to play an active role in an
attempt to improve relations with IEL's licensees.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Benefits of an insider's
view - Richard Gourlay meets a man who has seen deals from both sides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not clear whether Derek Lewis, who joins Schroder Ventures on January
1, is a poacher turned gamekeeper or gamekeeper turned poacher. Having
raised money from private equity providers for two businesses in the last 10
years  - once as a customer of Schroders  - he is crossing the tracks to
become a director advising on deals in the electronics industry.
Lewis has not always had the smoothest of relations with his new employers.
As he was negotiating the last details of the buy-out of parts of computer
company MBS Product Sales in 1989, Schroders 'tweaked' the terms, leaving
him and his management team with a reduced stake in the business.
'At the end, I was happy,' Lewis says. 'But it felt at the later stages that
the screw was being turned and it was not particularly productive.' Though a
relatively widespread practice, it is one which Schroders says it is now
leaving behind.
For management teams seeking capital, dealing with someone who has
negotiated from their side of the table may be a welcome development. From
Schroders' point of view, Lewis's arrival brings more than just knowledge of
the other side of the deal. He also has the kind of industry insider's
understanding of a market place which Schroders believes is an essential
ingredient for successfully competing with other providers of private
equity.
Lewis is in the unusual position of having not only led a buy-out but
started a company as well. In 1984, after 10 years with IBM, Lewis and a
partner bought a small computer broker, Combro, with finance from Citicorp
Venture Capital. They intended to build a distributor of mid-range
computers.
But the company evolved along quite different lines to that laid out in the
business plan on which Lewis raised the finance. Combro did sell mid-range
computers, but within 18 months it had also become IBM's biggest distributor
of PCs in the UK.
Its success was based on buying large volumes, supplying dealers at better
prices than they would get direct and by providing companies with very fine
pricing and swift service.
'The original plan was for a perfectly valid business but it would not have
become a dominant force,' Lewis says. 'The innovation was in recognising
that the terms of the IBM contract allowed you to sell on to other dealers.'
When Lewis sold Combro to MBS in 1987, sales had grown from Pounds 2m to
Pounds 40m. Two years later he was buying the business back as part of the
deal financed by Schroders after MBS management ran into trouble with its
other activities. And by 1992, the business had been sold to ICL for an
undisclosed amount.
Lewis is joining Schroder Ventures at a time when it and Schroders'
affiliates have been raising new capital for a number of its funds. Earlier
this year it successfully raised a third UK buy-out fund at Dollars 225m
(Pounds 137m).
Shortly afterwards it closed a Dollars 100m International Life Science Fund
and funds for Italy and Canada. And by Christmas it should have raised
Dollars 180m for an Asian development capital fund that is likely to close
at Dollars 250m.
This fund will make Schroders one of the largest private equity investors in
the region behind Prudential Asia. It will mainly provide development
capital to businesses taking advantage of growing markets in growing
economies, Schroders says.
By comparison the UK, where Lewis will focus most of his attention, is
relatively mature. Private equity investors are increasingly likely to
require infusions of industrial expertise like that provided by Lewis. But
does he see himself as poacher or gamekeeper? 'I prefer to look at it as
bringing the two sides together,' Lewis says. 'Every now and then the rabbit
will jump into the pot of its own accord.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Sowing seeds of
regeneration - Roland Adburgham on funding for companies in areas that have
lost their traditional coal and steel jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nestling beneath Castell Coch, a 19th-century fantasy castle in south Wales,
is the regional base of British Coal Enterprise. A few miles away, in
Cardiff docklands, is the regional office for British Steel (Industry).
The location of both these job-creation arms of the two industries has
symbolism. Castell Coch was built by the Marquess of Bute with fortunes made
from the coal of the Welsh valleys, where deep-mining has almost ended.
BS(I) is housed at what was East Moors steelworks, which closed in 1978 with
the loss of nearly 6,000 jobs.
Both organisations seek to stimulate regeneration by encouraging businesses
to grow within the local communities. They provide funding to enterprises
which find it hard to obtain risk capital elsewhere, at least at such
favourable interest rates. Both also offer managed workspace with easy lease
terms.
Today, BCE's future is in the balance with the privatisation of its
state-owned parent British Coal. A government announcement was due before
the end of November but last week Charles Wardle, junior energy minister,
said: 'The government and British Coal are currently exploring options for
the services provided by BCE and no final decision has been taken.'
BCE was established 10 years ago and BS(I) nearly 20 years ago to offset job
losses in coal and steel communities. Their futures could be finite because
the industry restructurings for which they were set up are largely
completed. Yet there is still a need for such services. In the Welsh
valleys, there are pockets of male unemployment of 30 per cent, and in
Scotland BS(I) is still tackling the effects of the Ravenscraig closure.
To justify a future, the organisations must demonstrate that they have a
cost-effective impact on permanent job creation.
Nigel Guy, director of 3i venture capital group in Wales, says that as BCE
and BS(I) are not fully commercial animals  - having a social responsibility
role  - they cannot be judged solely by private-sector standards. 'But at
the smaller end, they have done quite a reasonable job. They have provided
real seedcorn capital for businesses and a number have gone on to larger
things.'
Tillery Valley Foods was set up 10 years ago by husband and wife Chris and
Hilary Bradshaw to make quality chilled and frozen food at Abertillery, in
the Welsh valleys. The Bradshaws financed the start-up with Pounds 60,000
made from selling their Thames Valley house. BS(I) provided a similar amount
in preference shares and loans, subsequently redeemed and repaid.
Two years ago, 3i invested in the company by taking a 10 per cent stake.
'BS(I) were sympathetic backers and saw us through the lean first five years
when we could have gone bust,' Bradshaw says. 'This year, we should make a
profit of over Pounds 1m. We have always exceeded our job creation forecasts
and now employ 180 people.'
While this may be an exceptional success, BS(I) has been a self-financing
subsidiary of British Steel even before the latter's privatisation in 1988.
BCE, however, receives Pounds 7m a year from its parent, with which it also
has a Pounds 10m a year contract to deliver retraining and outplacement
services for ex-miners. It has also built up consultancy work for other
companies in the UK and abroad. For the government, this makes its future
more complex to determine.
BCE, which has a staff of 90 seconded from British Coal and an-other 400 on
short-term contracts, does not seek to profit on its business funding
because of the risk and low margins. It will make unsecured loans up to
Pounds 25,000 on five-year terms. But it can lend much more in loans or
equity. This summer it invested Pounds 250,000 in Techboard, a hardboard
factory at Ebbw Vale.
In common with BS(I), it is not simply filling what is seen as an equity
gap. 'With every investment client, we offer a business support service  - a
dual role to police the investment and also to try to help if there is a
problem,' says Jonathan Thomas, BCE's business funding manager in south
Wales. 'Sixty-six per cent are still trading five years on.' He adds: 'One
of the myths we have to overcome is that BCE is just for ex-miners  - they
are very much in a minority.'
David Hughes, BS(I) regional manager for Wales, says: 'We feel comfortable
lending in the Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 75,000 range. We're looking for
companies to grow irrespective of the starting point. If it is likely to
stay a one-man business, we wouldn't be interested.'
The organisations stress they act in partnership with other agencies and it
is businesses which create jobs. BCE says it achieved a milestone of 100,000
'employment opportunities' in 1993-94, which Philip Andrew, chief executive,
described as the 'most successful year' in its history. BS(I) says it has
had a similar number of 'job commitments'.
Although BS(I), which has a staff of only 36, lost Pounds 1.2m in its last
financial year, Vernon Smith, its chief executive, says: 'There is no
pressure from British Steel plc to try to cause us to be more profitable.
The aims of BS(I) are not in essence profit-making. Having said that, I
still have to run this operation as a business.'
Both organisations are putting more emphasis on supporting small- and
medium-sized enterprises rather than start-ups. Smith explains: 'We realise
that it's probably better to help the small business that actually operates.
If you back those, then you're backing someone who has a very good chance.
'Over the last six years our failure rate has been 25 per cent of the
capital we have put up. Venture capitalists think of that as a fair figure.
Last year our losses in relation to capital were 16.9 per cent. We were
delighted  - we're obviously past the worst of the recession.'

FT  20 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): BSI seeks views on safety
systems - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Public comment is being sought by the British Standards Institution on its
guide to health and safety management systems. The standard likely to follow
consultation will be linked to BS EN ISO 9000, the European equivalent of BS
5750, but is unlikely to become a certifiable standard.
BSI says the cost to employers of work accidents and work-related ill-health
is estimated to be equivalent to up to 10 per cent of UK company gross
trading profits. The organisation says a properly managed health and safety
system would save money.
The guide has been written to allow the 'typical manager' to design a system
that allows them to meet the requirements of the 1992 Management of Health
and Safety at Work Regulations, BSI says.
Comments are welcome until February 28 1995. The Guide to Health and Safety
Management Systems is available for Pounds 13 from BSI, 0181 996 9000.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Companies face bridge snub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish Office is likely to reduce the role of the private sector in
drawing up and promoting the project for a second road bridge across the
Firth of Forth.
It is expected instead to design the project itself and submit it to a
public inquiry before a decision is taken on whether to proceed.
The change of strategy, expected to be announced early in the new year, is
likely to be seen as a climbdown by the Scottish Office in the face of
strong opposition to a new bridge, mainly from people in Edinburgh and other
parts of Lothian.
It may also be viewed as a setback for the government's private finance
initiative, under which the government wants big construction projects to be
designed, financed and built by the private sector as far as possible.
Studies of the area around the Firth of Forth for the Scottish Office of
transport have concluded that a second road bridge would be needed in the
first decade of the next century.
The government was widely expected to announce that it had decided a package
of road and public transport improvements  - including a new bridge  - and
to invite tenders from private sector consortia to design, build, finance
and operate the improvements. The entire scheme would almost certainly have
faced a public inquiry when finalised, although this was never made clear by
the government.
Instead it appears likely that the transport scheme, including a new bridge,
will be developed by the Scottish Office and submitted to a public inquiry
before a decision is taken on whether to go ahead with it.
If the public inquiry concluded that a second road bridge was necessary, the
project would be put out to tender to be built and financed by the private
sector, with the risk borne by the private sector reduced.
Scottish Office ministers are understood to be drawing lessons from the
Birmingham northern relief road project, where the private-sector consortium
of Trafalgar House and Iritecna (of Italy) is facing a second public inquiry
which further increases the risk that the project will not go ahead, as well
as involving extra costs.
Four consortia of leading UK and European construction companies, as well as
banks, have registered an interest in tendering to build the bridge.

FT  20 DEC 94 / BAA opens Terminal 5 battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Failure to develop Heathrow would drive business overseas and undermine the
UK aviation industry, BAA, the airports operator, said yesterday.
BAA unveiled its long-awaited economic and environmental case for a fifth
terminal at London's main international airport in the opening shot in what
is likely to be a fiercely fought planning battle. A public inquiry is
expected to start in May next year.
BAA's case is supported by the Board of Airline Representatives, which
speaks for nearly all domestic and foreign airlines using UK airports, but
the development of Terminal 5 is opposed by local authority and
environmental groups.
The central premise of BAA's case is that existing capacity in the
south-east will be incapable of meeting forecast passenger demand by 2002.
Sir John Egan, BAA chief executive, said: 'Without a significant increase in
capacity where it is most needed we will fail to meet demand. For the sake
of the UK economy and the UK aviation industry we must provide more capacity
in the south-east.'
BAA's statement of case says Heathrow remains 'the first choice of airlines
and passengers'. It has unrivalled international connections and the trend
is towards greater centralisation based on the big hub airports.
The statement recognises that Gatwick and Stansted  - the two other main
airports in the south-east  - are growing to meet increased passenger
demand. But it says that only expansion at Heathrow will prevent additional
business going to rival European airports.
BAA said Terminal 5 would allow Heathrow's existing runways to handle 30m
more passengers a year, and would be a suitable alternative to the building
of an additional runway being at the airport until about 2015.
The airports operator, with British Airways, has been anxious to avoid the
row over the proposed new runway at Heathrow undermining the planned
development of Terminal 5, and hopes a decision on the additional runway
will be deferred.
BAA says development of the proposed terminal on an existing sewage sludge
site will displace only 15 houses. Although two rivers will have to be
re-routed the 'flow and quality of ground water would be maintained, and air
quality would remain within accepted limits'.
Yesterday Mr Des Wilson, BAA's public affairs director, released the results
of an opinion poll suggesting that local residents were less opposed to the
runway than had previously been thought.
The borough of Hounslow, which includes Heathrow, has conducted its own poll
showing more than half of local people are against an additional terminal.
The council said: 'Locals fear BAA's plan will mean more concrete and less
green space.'
Mr Dermot Cox, a committee member of the Heathrow Association for the
Control of Airport Noise, said BAA's proposals would mean a 'massive
increase in flights, congestion and pollution, while safety standards will
be under immense pressure'.
Mr Cox, a market researcher, challenged the validity of BAA's poll. He said:
'There are questions as to how it was conducted and whether it was an
appropriate method to resolve quite complex issues.'
Mr Wilson said anti-Heathrow groups 'receive more publicity than their
standing in the community warrants'.
The Department of the Environment said 95 per cent of the letters it had
received about the development of the terminal were hostile to it.

FT  20 DEC 94 / NUT chiefs urge test boycott end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday recommended that
its members end their boycott of national curriculum tests after the
government agreed to hold a wide-ranging consultation into the tests'
educational value.
The move, which may herald the end of two years' industrial action over the
issue, follows a meeting last week between Mr Doug McAvoy, the union's
general secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary.
All three teachers' unions boycotted the tests when they were introduced to
secondary schools in England and Wales last year. Two abandoned their
boycott last year after concessions by Mr John Patten, then education
secretary, but the NUT remained strongly opposed to them.
Mr McAvoy said the union's position had been strengthened by last week's
announcement that only 20 per cent of secondary schools reported the results
of English tests for 14-year-olds this year.
He described the agreement as a 'tremendous achievement' for the union's
campaign. The deal would lead to a consultative exercise similar to that
carried out by Sir Ron Dearing during his two-year review of the national
curriculum, he said.
Mrs Shephard, who had already announced in September a Pounds 30m package of
measures, suggested the consultation would be less ambitious. 'As in
previous years,' she said, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority,
chaired by Sir Ron, would evaluate the tests.
The NUT leadership continues to claim that the tests are 'educationally
unsound', however, and members telephoned the union yesterday to protest at
the apparent deal.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Private housing starts 'falter'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBYN CHALMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private housing starts are set for a year-end total of 156,000 compared with
141,200 last year but there are signs that strong growth in private starts
in the first six months of the year has tapered off, largely because of
higher interest rates and tax.
A survey by the House Builders Federation's said new house prices weakened
in recent months, while new home site visitors and net reservations  -
agreed sales on which a deposit has been paid  - remained stagnant.
A separate survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors will today
confirm that market activity has declined since spring. Mr Peter Miller,
residential property spokesman for the institution, described November as
another slow and frustrating month for the housing market.
Only two sectors, country houses and more exclusive homes in London, are
performing. Mr Miller said there was a shortage of properties for sale and
potential purchasers were not looking at anything they consider overpriced.
Both surveys are pessimistic about next year. The institution said the
number of sales was unlikely to rise significantly, but prices could
increase in line with inflation.
Mr John Stewart, managing editor of the federation's Housing Market Report,
expected slower growth in private housing starts and a modest sales rise.
He believed that builders' expectation of a better market in 1996 could
translate into stronger growth in starts towards the end of next year.

Only 7 per cent of finance directors or financial controllers surveyed by

Mr Michael Carttiss, one of the Euro-rebels who lost the Tory whip, launched
an attack on Mr John Major in the Commons last night.
Responding to recent appeals by the prime minister for unity in support of
the manifesto on which the Tories won the 1992 election, Mr Carttiss made
clear that he had no intention of begging to be allowed to return to the
fold. Mr Carttiss said he had sought to honour the manifesto while Mr Major
had failed to fulfil pledges to curb the sums paid by Britain to the

Mr Tony Blair and his shadow cabinet came under attack from the Labour back
benches last night for agreeing to reforms aimed at ending marathon sittings
of the Commons.
Mr Don Dixon, the party's deputy chief whip, made a temporary move to the
backbenches to argue against changes which would aid the passage of
government legislation.
He said: 'I see no reason, half way through a parliament when we have got
the government on the ropes, why we should give up any weapons.'
For the remainder of the present parliamentary session at least, 10pm will
be the 'normal' hour for the end of Commons business.

FT  20 DEC 94 / CU fined Pounds 105,000 over tied company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial services regulators have imposed a Pounds 105,000 fine on the life
insurance subsidiary of Commercial Union, one of the UK's biggest composite
insurers, over the quality of one of its representative companies, Alison
Smith writes.
Compensation totalling Pounds 185,000 has already been paid to 58 investors
by CU Life Assurance, and the subsidiary has undertaken that other investors
will be compensated. It will also pay the regulator's costs of Pounds
25,000.
The problems relate to the activities of an appointed representative  - a
company 'tied' to a life insurer and selling its products only  - where CU
ended the relationship more than two years ago.
The penalty was imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the
life insurance industry, now superseded by the Personal Investment
Authority, which acts as regulator for retail financial services.
Lautro said CU Life Assurance had failed to ensure that one of the
representatives was of good character and of requisite aptitude and
competence and had also failed to satisfy itself about the good character
and competence of the senior management of the tied agent.
CU said yesterday that it had improved its procedures.

FT  20 DEC 94 / BCCI plan wins court approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest settlement plan put to creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International was approved by the High Court yesterday.
The decision helps pave the way for the payment of an interim dividend to
creditors. But it will depend on courts in Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands, the other jurisdictions involved, also clearing the plan early in
the new year.
It is understood that under the plan proposed by the BCCI liquidators
creditors could eventually receive a dividend of between 30 per cent and 40
per cent of the money they lost. The interim dividend is expected to be
about 20 per cent.
In approving the plan Sir Richard Scott, the vice-chancellor, said the
proposed settlement had the backing of the vast majority of creditors. This
was a matter of 'very great significance' and he would need a very strong
reason not to give the liquidators the go-ahead.
Sir Richard rejected opposition to the plan from one depositor. The strength
of feeling among former BCCI depositors was understandable but this could
not be allowed to stand in the way of attempts to 'rescue what is left from
the wreck', he said.
Sir Richard also refused to consider applications from former BCCI directors
and employees for some of the assets recovered by the liquidators to be held
separately to meet possible future compensation awards to them.
The hearing in the Cayman Islands is scheduled for January 12. Luxembourg
courts are due to deliver their judgment on the same day.
An appeal against yesterday's High Court decision can be lodged within 14
days.

FT  20 DEC 94 / NUT leadership calls for end to test boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leadership of the National Union of Teachers yesterday recommended that
its members end their boycott of national curriculum tests after the
government agreed to hold a wide-ranging consultation into the tests'
educational value.
The move, which may herald the end of two years' industrial action over the
issue, follows a meeting last week between Mr Doug McAvoy, the union's
general secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, education secretary.
All three teachers' unions boycotted the tests when they were introduced to
secondary schools in England and Wales last year. Two abandoned their
boycott last year after concessions by Mr John Patten, then education
secretary, but the NUT remained strongly opposed to them.
Mr McAvoy said the union's position had been strengthened by last week's
announcement that only 20 per cent of secondary schools reported the results
of English tests for 14-year-olds this year. He said this showed the boycott
was still strong.
He described the agreement as a 'tremendous achievement' for the union's
campaign. The deal would lead to a consultative exercise similar to the
consultations carried out by Sir Ron Dearing during his two-year review of
the national curriculum, he said.
Mrs Shephard, who had already announced in September a Pounds 30m package of
measures including external markers to placate teachers, suggested the
consultation would be less ambitious. 'As in previous years,' she said, the
School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron, would
evaluate the tests.
She said: 'I have taken a series of steps to respond to teachers' concerns
about workload and to enhance teachers' professionalism. I am glad that the
NUT executive has responded in a professional and considered way.'
Mr McAvoy said Mrs Shephard's 'willingness to understand the professional
and educational concerns of teachers' had made the announcement possible.
The union will ballot its members on the proposal, and will lift the boycott
if a majority are in favour.
However, Mr McAvoy made clear the union would continue to support members
who claim that the tests create an unreasonable workload. This is in line
with the policy of the other teachers' unions.
The NUT leadership continues to claim that the tests are 'educationally
unsound', a view endorsed by 90 per cent of members who responded to a
survey in October. Members telephoned the union yesterday afternoon to
protest at the apparent deal.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Lords allow home income plan appeal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords yesterday granted the Investors Compensation Scheme leave
to appeal in a case involving home income plans.
The ICS, a scheme for clients of authorised investment firms which have
collapsed, has sought a House of Lords hearing since June when the Court of
Appeal extended the grounds for compensation to home income plan investors.
The judgment ruled that the scheme did not have discretion to decide levels
of compensation according to what it considered fair. The ICS wants
clarification on a number of issues affecting the implementation of the
judgment.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce keeps hold of the steering wheel: The agenda
behind yesterday's BMW deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For as long as Rolls-Royce Motor Cars remains true to its traditions as a
producer of luxury cars at the very highest  - and much the most volatile  -
end of the new car market, it will have difficulty controlling its own
destiny.
The engine supply and collaborative engineering agreement it announced
yesterday with BMW of Germany should at least make the long-term task easier
without, as yet, compromising its relative independence.
It lifts from the illustrious Crewe-based carmaker, a subsidiary of Vickers,
one of the heaviest financial burdens facing any small-scale vehicle
manufacturer  - to design, develop and manufacture the complex engines
needed to propel more than two tonnes of vehicle and to meet a maze of
ever-stricter legislation on exhaust emissions, fuel economy and other
technical standards.
Rolls-Royce's own engines, with their roots in the 1950s, can meet emission
standards up to the end of this century. Yesterday's deal, arrived at after
months of negotiation with both BMW and possible alternative supplier
Mercedes-Benz  - Vickers yesterday freely admitted playing one off against
the other  - goes a lot further.
The V8 and V12 engines BMW already produces for its own vehicles will be
jointly re-engineered for the Rolls-Royce and Bentley ranges. Another
Vickers subsidiary, Cosworth Engineering, which specialises in
high-performance car engines, is also to play a role in their development.
The two companies will look at other component systems and technological
help BMW might be able to supply to Rolls-Royce.
Not least, they will explore how best to build and bring to market 'Concept
Java', the spectacular prototype coupe Rolls-Royce has been displaying at
motor shows around the world. The response has been overwhelmingly
favourable.
The collaboration is aimed at helping Rolls-Royce to bring its next
generation of new models to market towards the end of the century. As Mr
Peter Ward, Rolls' chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'There is
no screaming rush.'
What the deal seemingly does not do, in spite of much media speculation to
the contrary, is to launch immediately the now-familiar process of a small
British carmaker with a big reputation being absorbed into a much bigger
foreign one.
There is no provision for BMW either to buy Rolls-Royce, or to take an
equity stake. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers, said yesterday
neither was in prospect 'for the foreseeable future'.
Rolls-Royce executives point out that the agreement, of which no financial
details were released yesterday, is not all one way. Rolls-Royce has been
quietly advising BMW on its interior trim for several years.
Mr Chandler left the door at least slightly ajar, however, in acknowledging
that 'nothing is impossible in the long term'. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder,
BMW's chairman who was in London for the announcement, said: 'If and when it
is on the table we will discuss it.'
BMW earlier this year bought Rover Group, whose Swindon pressings plant
already supplies the bodies for Rolls-Royce's existing cars. Mr
Pischetsrieder said that BMW wants to get even more closely involved in the
UK industry.
When it comes to the long term, Rolls-Royce's management readily concedes
that one of its biggest problems, the volatility of the luxury market, will
never go away.
Even if it were able to prove its disputed claim to make 'the best car in
the world', the company would be unable to prevent sales plunging more
sharply than those of other carmakers in times of recession.
When jobs are being cut and other costs slashed, the cars  - no matter how
good they may be  - become the unacceptable face of indulgence and sales dry
up.
In the past Rolls-Royce has slipped into losses just as predictably as it
has risen to being Vickers' single biggest profit earner when the good times
have returned.
Mr Ward insists that the financial rollercoaster has come to an end as the
result of drastic action to reduce the company's break-even level.
When the last recession struck in 1991 the Crewe factory needed to produce
2,400 cars to break even. Its sales plunged from 3,333 in 1990 to 1,723 in
1991 and to 1,378 in 1992.
According to Mr Ward flexible team working, heavy investment in automated
machining processes and other productivity measures had reduced the
break-even level to below 1,300 at the start of this year and higher margins
from niche models such as the Bentley Continental coupe have reduced this
further.
As a result Rolls-Royce is believed to be on course to make pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 12m this year, in spite of world-wide sales up only 2.2 per
cent, at 1,051, in the first three quarters.
Mr Ward said the collaboration with BMW should help reduce that level even
further.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Car panel plant sold for Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ogihara, the Japanese maker of pressed steel components for the motor
industry, is moving into the European market through the purchase of a plant
at Telford, Shropshire. The move is a joint venture with Marubeni, the
trading corporation.
The companies said in Tokyo yesterday they were paying Y3bn (Pounds 19.2m)
for the factory and would take it over on January 1. The plant, employing 86
people, would have closed had they not done so.
The Telford factory is owned by Venture Pressings, a joint venture of Jaguar
Cars and GKN. It opened in 1990 to make body panels for Jaguar. When Jaguar
became part of Ford it gained access to other sources of panels, diminishing
the need for the Telford site.
Ogihara has been considering setting up a presence in Europe for some years.
Its first approach to the Telford authorities came in August 1992. A
supplier to motor manufacturers in Japan, it has plants in Michigan, Taiwan
and Thailand and an office in Beijing.
Japanese motor component makers have been moving to Europe in parallel with
the assemblers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Latterly currency movements
have made European production of components price competitive with goods
produced in Japan.
Ogihara will own 51 per cent of its joint venture with Marubeni. The venture
starts with capital of Pounds 4.5m. It will continue to supply Jaguar with
limited quantities of panels.
Telford Development Agency, which seeks inward investment for the town, said
yesterday it expected Ogihara to expand production soon and to diversify.
Jobs at the plant could rise to more than 150.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Foreign exchange tax reform to proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radical plans for reforming the taxation of foreign exchange gains and
losses will go ahead, the government has announced.
Laws designed to allow UK businesses to operate on a similar basis to
international competitors will come into force on March 23.
The government, which first published draft proposals in 1989, considers
that the new rules will help preserve London's status as a financial centre.
Pressure for reform has existed for nearly 20 years.
The taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses has long been a complex
area because of the ending of fixed exchange rates.
The new system will tax foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary
assets, such as cash and bank deposits, and liabilities when they accrue  -
in line with commercial accounting rules. The changes will mainly affect
companies that take out finance in foreign currencies and those with assets
held in currencies subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations.
The rules will permit companies to offset losses on exchange fluctuations
against tax. Previously companies have been taxed on exchange gains without
being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses.
Mr Jim Marshall, head of international taxation at accountants KPMG, said
there was broad support for the plans. While 'fundamental problems' did
exist, he hoped the dialogue with the Inland Revenue would continue.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Budget 'provokes confidence drop'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence among consumers fell sharply this month in the wake of the
November Budget, says a survey from Gallup, the market research group.
It found a sharp deterioration in how people viewed the financial position
of their households next year and in their perception of general economic
developments.
The poll, conducted in the first two weeks of December for the European
Commission, found 38 per cent thought the financial position of their
household would worsen in the next 12 months against 27 per cent in
November.
Those expecting an improvement fell to 16 per cent from 19 per cent. The
resulting balance, the main indicator of opinion, widened to minus 22 per
cent from minus 8 per cent in November and was the worst since May.
Gallup reported a similar worsening of the public's view of the likely
development of the UK economy.
It found that people were gloomier about inflation, employment prospects and
their ability to save any money next year.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Cunard hit by storm of protest at QE2 refit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A passenger on board the Queen Elizabeth 2 in mid-Atlantic said yesterday
that the liner should 'never have set sail' with work still incomplete on a
Pounds 30m refit.
His comments came as ticket holders left behind by the liner besieged
Cunard, its owner, demanding compensation.
Cunard at first closed its doors to angry passengers outside its Pall Mall
headquarters in London, but said later it had made compensation arrangements
with the 500 passengers who were unable to leave with the QE2 from
Southampton on Saturday because of refitting work on 100 cabins.
The compensation is believed to be based on Cunard's original offer of a
full refund by Christmas, with a free transatlantic cruise next year and
Pounds 250 spending money.
Some disappointed ticketholders said, however, that they still planned legal
action against Cunard. Passengers on board the liner said Cunard was likely
to receive many compensation claims even from those who had travelled.
Last night Mr David Steene, who picketed the Cunard office acting as
'unelected mouthpiece' for angry ticketholders, said: 'I (and the other
passengers) have received an unreserved apology for the distress and
disappointment caused.
'I will be joining the QE2 with my family in New York and I have been
assured by a director of Cunard . . . .that satisfactory individual
alternative arrangements for all other passengers have been made and have
been accepted by them.'
One passenger on the liner said: 'Why they ever put to sea with the ship in
the state it was in on Saturday I just don't know. Some passengers have got
cabins without running water and with sinks that are blocked. They are
having a torrid time.' He said that, contrary to statements from Cunard,
public areas as well as cabins were still being refitted.
The passenger, who paid more than Pounds 10,000 for tickets for his family,
said: 'The whole of the third deck is being ripped up (with) carpets left,
right and centre. There are workmen everywhere.'
Since leaving Southampton the liner has hit force 10 gales, adding
seasickness to the misery of the 600 passengers aboard a vessel which one
contractor described as 'worse than a building site'.
The QE2 was six hours late leaving Southampton but passengers have been told
the bad weather is likely to make it 24 hours late into New York, where it
was expected to arrive on Thursday. The majority will disembark there but
some are to continue on a 117-day round-the-world cruise.
About 300 passengers had their holidays cancelled late last week, when it
became clear that the ship was not going to be ready. Hundreds of other
passengers arriving at Southampton on Saturday were told they could not all
be accommodated because of work in 100 cabins.
About 190 passengers agreed to take compensation instead, but 80 boarded
knowing their cabins were not ready.
The Pounds 30m refit included renewing the interiors of all 960 passenger
cabins, as well as building two new staircases, a pub and two nightclubs,
and refitting other public areas  - all in 25 days.
Mr Bill Childerstone, managing director of CLC, a ship outfitter in
Southampton which completed its Pounds 2m contract on the QE2 in time, said
the project was ambitious, but should have been achievable.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Report calls Pounds 2bn road-building programme into
question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Techniques used by the Department of Transport for more than 20 years to
assess road-building schemes are challenged in a report by independent
transport experts published yesterday.
Their conclusions bring into question the methods by which the government
justifies its annual Pounds 2bn road-building programme.
But its publication by the government, after a nine-month delay, may not be
entirely fortuitous. With the roads spending programme under pressure from
budget cuts it will provide arguments for ministers trying to justify the
failure to build long-promised projects.
The authors, a group of nine academics, traffic consultants and surveyors,
set out to answer four questions: Do road improvements create more traffic
 -as opposed to diverting vehicles from other congested roads? If so, what
are the consequences for the planning and design of road schemes and does it
matter? What road schemes are most likely to be affected? How should present
methods of forecasting and appraisal be amended?
Their answers provide a highly critical analysis of the government's current
techniques. The experts conclude:
Additional, or 'induced' traffic 'can and does occur, probably quite
extensively, though its size and significance is likely to vary widely in
different circumstances'.
Since the Department of Transport's own calculations assume that people
attach value to time savings made on travel 'travellers must, as a matter of
logic, be assumed to respond . . . by travelling more or further.'
'The economic value of a scheme can be overestimated by the omission of even
a small amount of induced traffic. We consider that this is a matter of
profound importance.'
Induced traffic makes most difference to plans when congestion is already
high. Schemes must be most carefully appraised when they involve roads in
and around towns, tunnels or bridges crossing river estuaries and strategic
motorways.
Road planning must take account of the likelihood that new roads create
traffic. Improvements to long-distance routes must weigh their impact on the
entire corridor or region involved and not just on local traffic.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said that all road schemes at the
planning stage would be reviewed and that further research would be carried
out into ways of forecasting traffic volumes.
But he tried to play down the impact of the report, saying: 'Although the
report is consistent with our long-standing view that new schemes do not
generate a significant number of trips which are entirely new, the overall
amount of traffic on the network may in some cases rise by more than is
usually allowed for.'
Transport 2000, which opposes the government's road-building programme,
called the report 'a watershed in the transport debate'.
The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England said the review 'tears the
heart out of the government's road-building policy and should trigger a
fundamental review'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Bomb find poses fresh threat to peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process appeared to be in danger of stalling
yesterday, with republicans forced on the defensive after the discovery of a
bomb in County Fermanagh. It is the first such incident since the IRA
ceasefire three months ago.
An explosive device containing 2lb of Semtex explosive was discovered in a
furniture store in Enniskillen. The IRA, in a short statement yesterday,
denied responsibility for planting it.
The possibility that the Irish government would reverse its decision to
place a block on the pre-Christmas early release of IRA prisoners was last
night thought to depend on whether the IRA denial was accepted by Dublin.
The new justice minister, Ms Nora Owen, said she hoped to make a statement
in the next few days.
The find overshadowed yesterday's second session of exploratory talks
between British officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. It will
underscore British demands to see the issue of the decommissioning of arms
and explosives resolved before Sinn Fein is invited to engage in full
political talks with the government and other constitutional parties.
The issue is likely to be high on the agenda at today's meeting between Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister, and Mr John Bruton, the new prime
minister of the Irish Republic.
The find is the first evidence of the use of Semtex since the IRA ceasefire
at the beginning of September. The IRA is the only paramilitary organisation
believed to possess such material.
Mr Martin McGuinness, who led the five-strong Sinn Fein delegation at
yesterday's talks, refused to condemn the action. He said: 'It was an
incident of no great significance, and it certainly won't affect the peace
process.'
He suggested the incident might have been part of a 'dirty tricks operation'
designed to implicate republicans in violence.
Mr Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland political affairs minister, expressed
disappointment that Sinn Fein, as a democratic party, had declined to
condemn the action. He said Sinn Fein had requested a further meeting in
January.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist MP, described the attempted bombing as
'a carefully orchestrated IRA operation to intimidate the British government
into agreeing unjustified concessions'.
Mr Bruton, speaking in Dublin before leaving for today's talks in London,
said he was 'saddened' by the incident, but he stressed there were 'certain
unusual aspects of the incident, which made it unclear who was involved'.

A Pounds 630m contract for Royal Navy submarine torpedoes was awarded to

torpedoes would create 40 jobs at the company's plant at Waterlooville,
Hampshire, and safeguard jobs in other companies  - 80 per cent of the
manufacturing and processing work will be sub-contracted.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Family tax cost will rise to 35.6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The amount of tax the government takes from the average family is set to
rise again next year, further denting the Conservatives credentials as the
party of low taxation, David Owen writes.
New figures released last night by the Treasury show that a married man on
average earnings, with two children, will pay 35.6 per cent of his earnings
in direct and indirect taxes in 1995-96  - up from 34.7 per cent in the
current financial year.
This outstrips the 32.2 per cent that a similar family would have paid in
1978-79, when the Labour party was last in power.
When the government acknowledged in January that its 1993-94 tax take would
amount to 32.8 per cent of an average family's earnings, the disclosure was
immediatedly pounced on by the opposition parties.
Sir George Young, financial secretary to the Treasury, replying to a written
question by Mr Andrew Smith, Labour MP for Oxford East, said that tax
increases taking effect over the next year would cost households on average
about Pounds 2.30 a week.
He added that real personal disposable income was still expected to rise by
1 1/2 per cent next year. 'This should mean that households will on average
be about Pounds 5 a week better off after tax and inflation,' he said.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Business expenditure on research revised upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Spending on research and development by Britain's businesses has been more
buoyant than thought in recent years, although in real terms it still has to
recover to pre-recession levels, the Central Statistical Office reported
yesterday.
The CSO said its first large-scale survey for four years of business R&amp;D
showed a 19 per cent increase in cash outlays to Pounds 9.13bn last year
from Pounds 7.65bn in 1989, with the sums spent in both years amounting to
1.5 per cent of gross domestic product.
In real terms R&amp;D spending last year was 3 per cent down from the level of
1989, but had recovered from 1991 when spending dipped in the recession to
1.4 per cent of GDP.
Following its survey of 5,000 businesses the CSO revised its estimates of
R&amp;D spending in 1990, 1991 and 1992 upwards. Previously the CSO reported
that R&amp;D spending fell in real terms in 1992 but it now says there was a
slight increase.
The four years to last year saw a marked shift from defence to civil R&amp;D.
Civil spending increased 31 per cent to Pounds 7.77bn in cash terms in the
period and in real terms was 7 per cent higher last year compared with 1989.
Spending on defence R&amp;D fell 21 per cent in cash terms to Pounds 1.36bn and
was 36 per cent lower in real terms last year than in 1989.
Staff working on civil R&amp;D increased by 4 per cent in the four years
compared with a 42 per cent fall in those engaged on defence projects. In
the same period government funding of business R&amp;D fell to 13 per cent of
the total from 17 per cent.
The CSO said the number of staff employed on R&amp;D fell 6 per cent between
1989 and 1993. This reflected a 14 per cent fall in support staff while the
number of scientists and engineers increased 2 per cent.
The report painted a less gloomy picture of employment in British R&amp;D than
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which recently
said the decline in R&amp;D jobs had been 'particularly pronounced . . . for
four years in a row'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Howard rejects calls to resign over jail break-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday rejected Labour demands for
his resignation after he released a report into a break-out by five
terrorists and an armed robber from Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire.
The report by Sir John Woodcock, former chief inspector of constabulary,
blamed the escape on management confusion that allowed 'pampered' inmates to
take advantage of lax security. He said: 'So many things were wrong, so many
procedures and policies totally ignored, and with such regularity, that the
escape could have taken place on any day of any week with the same chance of
success.'
Mr Howard told the Commons that the break-out, and the subsequent discovery
of a pound of Semtex explosive at Whitemoor, happened because the prison
service failed to follow written instructions.
He said a separate report drawn up before the break-out by Judge Stephen
Tumin, the inspector of prisons, concurred in the general view in the prison
service that Whitemoor was 'virtually impregnable'.
Mr Howard announced a further inquiry by Sir David Yardley, the former local
government ombudsman, into whether there was sufficient evidence to bring
disciplinary charges against members of the prison service.
A separate inquiry by Sir John Learmont, the former quartermaster general
for the army, will review security in all prisons, including the possible
introduction of glass screens to prevent contact between inmates and
visitors.
Mr Howard said security had been tightened at Whitemoor and prisoners'
perks, such as use of telephones, excessive personal property and sending
warders to do their shopping, had been stopped.
He added that Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, had
agreed 'there will be no question of a bonus' this year. Mr Lewis was paid a
bonus of Pounds 35,000 for the year to March.
The Whitemoor escapers, armed with two pistols smuggled into the prison,
escaped by cutting fencing and climbing another fence with rope made in the
prison workshop.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Defence of steel industry urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should 'review its position' on state aid for the steel
industry if other European Union producers continued to receive state
subsidies, the Commons trade and industry committee said yesterday.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The system of
state aids to European steel producers is a shambles and it is British steel
producers who are paying the price.
'If the lack of proper controls over Euro-state aid continues, in the medium
term the British industry will be forced to cut . . . new investment and
capacity and shed more jobs in order to prop up less efficient, subsidised
steel producers in the rest of Europe.
'The government can no longer sit back and allow European producers to
benefit from state subsidies to the detriment of the British steel
industry.'
The report calls on the government to 'continue to resist any new state aids
or the weakening of existing conditions for state aids in the steel
industry'. But if non-compliance continues the UK should reconsider its
position.
It adds: 'The ability of the UK steel industry to compete is adversely
affected by excess capacity in other EU countries which is artificially
preserved by state aids.'
The MPs said their inquiry was prompted by 'growing concern over the ability
of the European Commission to control this situation'. The report outlines
the failure of an EU restructuring plan which aimed to cut European steel
capacity by up to 26m tonnes.
Many MPs blamed a decision a year ago to allow state aid for six struggling
companies in Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal in return for a capacity
reduction of 5.5m tonnes.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Access to railway network curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition on the privatised railway network is to be restricted for at
least seven years to prevent a free-for-all which would damage the interests
of travellers and rail companies.
Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, yesterday announ-ced plans for tight
controls on new entrants to the railway business until March 1999 and
continuing 'substantial restrictions' for at least a further three years.
He said unbridled competition on the railways from companies which bid to
run individual lines or services could damage the interests of the
franchisees that acquired the right to run entire regional networks.
British Rail's passenger services are to be franchised to 25 private
operators. The government originally intended to allow 'open access'
operators to bid for particular routes or services to increase competition
with franchisees. But protests from prospective franchisees prompted a
rethink.
Mr Swift said: 'The railway industry is still at an early stage . . . of
fundamental restructuring. I do not believe it would be wise to expose train
operators or passengers to the risks of experimenting with uncontrolled
competition.'
He said there would be enough competition between franchised operators which
ran trains on the same routes and between the franchisees and services still
run by BR.
The rail regulator will restrict the right of Railtrack, the owner of the
track, stations and signals, to sell 'paths' on its lines if the rival
service would affect the core business of the existing train operator. From
1999 to 2002 the level of new competition allowed will depend on the degree
of competition already being mounted by neighbouring franchisees.

FT  20 DEC 94 / MPs call for defence of steel industry against EU rivals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government should 'review its position' on state aid for the steel
industry if other European Union producers continued to receive state
subsidies, the House of Commons trade and industry committee said yesterday.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the committee, said: 'The system of

The MPs said their short inquiry was prompted by 'growing concern over the
ability of the European Commission to control this situation'. The report
outlines the failure of an EU restructuring plan which aimed to cut European
steel capacity by up to 26m tonnes.
Many MPs blamed an industry council decision a year ago to allow state aid
for six struggling companies in Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal in return
for a capa-city reduction of 5.5m tonnes.
The report says: 'There are doubts as to whether the cuts offered have been
made in productive capacity, as well as concern about the amount of aid
granted.'
The MPs said the commission did not have enough power to punish member
states for breaking subsidy rules and warned that failure to restructure the
industry had left long-term problems.
Mr Tim Eggar, trade minister, had pressed for stricter control of subsidies
but Britain's steel producers felt the government 'could have been more
supportive of the domestic industry in the past'.
The report says the British steel industry's 'success in restructuring and
improving efficiency' in the past decade 'should not now be undermined by
subsidies in Europe and the lack of political will in the EU Industry
Council to stand firm on state aids'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Radio reforms fail to boost audiences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent renaissance in radio may prove short-lived as more stations open
and listening patterns fragment, says the latest Cultural Trends report from
the Policy Studies Institute.
The report suggests that although the reforms in the 1990 Broadcasting Act
have had little effect on television viewing, they have had a dramatic
impact on radio.
New stations, such as Classic FM and Virgin 1215, have built sizeable
audiences but they have taken listeners from the established national
stations. They have not expanded overall audience, just as video, cable and
satellite have not increased television viewing.
BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4 television channels have recaptured some of
their lost share of viewing in cabled homes, the Independent Television
Commission says. They raised their share to 65.1 per cent in October from
57.9 per cent in October last year.

The administrators of Polly Peck International, the failed empire of
fugitive businessman Mr Azil Nadir, yesterday moved closer to gaining
control of assets in northern Cyprus.
A cheque for nearly Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) was paid by a
representative of Voyager Kibris, a PPI subsidiary, to the government of the
breakaway republic for unpaid rent on the Jasmine Court Hotel.
Mr Chris Barlow, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand and lead administrator, said
there were plans to meet the government today to discuss payment of tax

FT  20 DEC 94 / Nigeria pays the price of instability: Disenchanted
companies are looking elsewhere to invest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since Nigeria's military regime detailed its economic policies in
January 1994, it has received blunt warnings of economic decline and
disinvestment from Nigeria's private sector.
A survey of British business experiences in emerging markets, published
yesterday by Control Risks Group, underlines this message. The survey shows
the ratio of opportunity against risk in Nigeria as minus 4.5, whilst Africa
as a whole receives a positive ratio of 2.5.
Nigeria's advantages over most of the African continent  - the largest
domestic market in Africa, its dominance in the manufacturing and oil and
gas sectors in west Africa and its agricultural potential  - are being
eroded as disadvantages rise.
Many problems stem from political instability. In 1993 and 1994, industry
lost nearly two months' business because of political strikes which brought
fuel supplies and transport almost to a halt, and closed ports, banks and
offices.
In July and August this year, the strikes hit multinational oil producers as
the unions damaged equipment and threatened staff who continued to work. The
manoeuvring by the military to retain power has eroded policymaking which is
either on hold, non-existent or liable to sudden U-turns. The most damaging
of these was the imposition of foreign exchange controls this year which
stopped several planned investments in agriculture and agro-industry by
multinationals.
High inflation, low productivity and currency devaluation have hit spending
power and depressed local demand while ill-conceived macro-economic policies
have aggravated restrictions on investment. The limit of 40 per cent foreign
ownership in the main sectors of the economy, including, oil and gas
production, banking and manufacturing industry, deprives multinationals of
control.
Nigeria has missed out on the interest in emerging markets funds and has
been left behind by neighbouring Ghana's newer and smaller stock exchange.
Payment uncertainties are an old problem for contractors and suppliers in
Nigeria and now affect most sectors of industry.
The failure of the state oil company, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, to pay its 60 per cent share of the operating costs in its
joint ventures with the international oil companies forced Shell to declare
NNPC in default. The oil majors have warned that unless the government
improves its funding or reduces its equity, more default notices will follow
next year and production will decline.
Another difficulty is fraud. International companies have become a prime
target for embezzlement, false invoicing and counterfeit documents, notes
and even fake drugs.
Armed robbery and street crime, and the corruption and inefficiency of the
police force, make extra security essential to protect homes, offices and
vehicles. Several large companies employ and equip local police units to get
the service they require. At Lagos airport customs officials try to extort
money, and touts deceive, abduct and rob visitors on arrival.
Bureaucratic corruption pervadesall levels. These problems are less
discouraging when companies are making sizeable profits. But if Nigeria's
economy continues its downward slide, the negative factors will add to the
reasons why Nigerian and international businesses are looking elsewhere to
invest.

The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a unit of the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, has shut two crude oil flow stations in south-eastern
Nigeria after an oil spillage caused by sabotage, Reuter reports from Lagos.
The stations at Benisede and Opukushi were shut last week in order not to
worsen the spillage caused by broken pipes, which were cut by unknown
persons, Shell said. The Daily Times newspaper said the two stations
normally produce about 66,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Shell said such
spillages were not uncommon.

Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday said a controversial capital
gains tax would go ahead on January 1 as planned. The statement put an end
to a cabinet row over the proposed measure and settled more than a week of
uncertainty. It would mean Israeli investors would have to pay tax of 10 or
20 per cent on stock market profits, depending on whether they wanted to
deduct their losses. The option with deductions would be assessed at 20 per
cent of net profits and would require investors to file year-end tax
reports. The option without deductions would be assessed at 10 per cent and
would be deducted at source.
Mr Rabin made the announcement after meeting Mr Abraham Shochat, the finance
minister, who has spent the last week fending off fierce criticism of the
tax from other ministers. Opponents maintained the proposals had hit support
for Mr Rabin's Labour party.

<TEXT>
Mr Pedro Collor de Mello, whose revelations of top-level corruption in
Brazil led to the toppling of his brother, former president Fernando Collor,
in 1992, died yesterday in New York.
Mr Pedro Collor, who was 42, was declared brain dead on Saturday after
suffering from brain cancer and was being maintained on a life-support
machine. In an interview in May 1992, Mr Pedro Collor said his younger
brother had amassed a fortune through a multi-million-dollar influence
peddling scheme and that he had used cocaine. Faced with an impeachment
trial and huge street demonstrations across Brazil, Mr Fernando Collor
resigned in December 1992 and was subsequently banned from politics for
eight years. Last week a Brazilian court threw out criminal charges of
bribe-taking against Mr Fernando Collor.

<TEXT>
Armed rebels in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas announced that
thousands of their troops had slipped by positions held by government
soldiers and that they now occupied 38 of the state's 110 municipalities.
There were no immediate reports of fighting but eyewitnesses said Indian
peasants armed with rifles were blockading highways around the state and had
taken over at least one town hall. Subcommandante Marcos, leader of the
rebel Zapatista Army, said the move was his troops' first 'major military
action' since a ceasefire declared on January 12.
Government troops have controlled the standoff by encircling Zapatista
territory, but the new action may complicate the situation, putting
government forces in the middle of territory claimed by the Zapatistas.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Fresh US attempt to reform banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jim Leach, the incoming chairman of the House banking committee,
yesterday outlined an ambitious programme of banking legislation, parts of
which will be launched early in the new year.
The series of bills will include legislation to reform the Glass-Steagall
Act, which separates many aspects of commercial and investment banking in
the US, and an initiative to reduce the number of agencies responsible for
banking regulation.
Mr Leach, currently Republican minority leader of the committee, also
outlined plans for legislation to cover the derivatives markets, and to give
the US administration powers to retaliate against countries which shut out
US financial services companies.
Plans for reform of Glass-Steagall have foundered before on wrangles between
the different interest groups involved. Many big US commercial banks, along
with foreign banks operating in the US, have argued strenuously for greater
freedom to trade and underwrite securities, and to enter the insurance
business.
Mr Leach said this was the 'first and most important' issue facing the
banking industry, and that he would introduce a bill on the first day of the
new Congress to end the barrier between commercial and investment banking.
The incoming chairman also hinted at a more moderate plan for consolidation
among bank regulators than that attempted earlier this year, which would
have led the Federal Reserve to giving up its bank regulation powers.
Mr Leach, while praising the Fed, said the Office of Thrift Supervision,
which overseas the savings and loans industry, looked 'increasingly
superfluous'.
A bill on derivatives would not be introduced until 1996, he added.

commission deciding the party's strategy and tactics, said speculation that
the ANC would end its reconciliatory policy towards whites and devote itself
to blacks was unfounded.
The 11 commissions formalising party policy on issues ranging from next
year's local government elections to foreign affairs will present their
findings to the party plenary today when election results for the party's
six top posts will also be announced. President Nelson Mandela and deputy
president Thabo Mbeki are almost certain to be elected to the presidency and

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday said a controversial capital
gains tax would go ahead on January 1 as planned. The statement put an end
to a cabinet row over the proposed measure and settled more than a week of
uncertainty.
Mr Rabin made the announcement after meeting Mr Abraham Shochat, the finance
minister, who spent last week fending off fierce criticism over the tax on
stock market profits. Opponents maintained that imposition of the tax had
caused a decline in public support for Mr Rabin's Labour party.
Mr Rabin, however, said he was considering modifying the tax and would be
listening to the investors in Israel's stock exchange.
Under the present legislation, investors will have the option of paying
varying rates depending on whether they want to deduct stock market losses.
The option with deductions will be assessed at a 20 per cent rate on net
profits and will require investors to file year-end tax reports.
The option without deductions will be assessed at 10 per cent and will be
deducted at source.
Foreign investors living in countries which have a double-tax treaty with
Israel, like most western European nations, will be exempt from paying the
tax.
Stock market analysts say the prospect of implementing the tax has been one
factor depressing the stock market which has declined about 35 per cent in
the past year.
The market rallied briefly last week while Mr Rabin was abroad, but
sentiment was quickly damped after the announcement and shares yesterday
afternoon steadily shed their morning gains. The Mishtanim index, which had
risen 3.25 per cent during the morning, was up by only 0.05 per cent shortly
after the announcement.

<TEXT>
Senior members of the Clinton administration yesterday outlined the details
of about Dollars 24bn in spending cuts and departmental rationalisation
designed in part to finance the Dollars 60m middle class tax cut proposals
unveiled last week.
President Bill Clinton also announced that he had ordered Vice President Al
Gore to expand the existing 'reinventing government' programme under his
direction, and to produce further proposals within 90 days.
He repeated that any tax cuts had to be paid for in order not to increase
the federal deficit. The bulk of finance for his proposed tax cuts comes
from the Dollars 52bn generated by continuing for two more years the freeze
on discretionary spending. Over the weekend, some prominent Republicans had
agreed that it would be wrong to sacrifice deficit reduction on the altar of
tax cuts.
Mr Gore said consideration had been given to abolishing several government
departments and agencies, as demanded by some Republicans, but that the
'reform option' was the better approach. However he pledged to 'make
government work better and do less' and 'to trade interference for
opportunity'.
Dr Alice Rivlin, the budget director, said the time had clearly come to
'sort out roles and missions'.
Basic questions to be addressed included: 'Should the federal government be
doing all these things? Should it be making all these decisions? Should it
be handing out all these specific little grants?'
The brunt of the Dollars 24bn five year hit is being borne by the
departments of energy (Dollars 10.6bn) and transport (Dollars 6.7bn), with
smaller slices from the budgets of housing (Dollars 800m), and two agencies
which serve the federal government machine  - the general services
administration (Dollars 1.4m) and office of personnel management (Dollars
30,000). A further Dollars 4.5bn of spending cuts remain to be identified.
Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, said his department would
see its staff cut roughly in half from 106,000 to 54,000 over five years,
with the 40,000 employees at present involved in air traffic control coming
under the auspices of a new government corporation.
But 10 separate departmental divisions would be consolidated into three, and
30 existing loan programmes, each with their own rules and criteria, would
be reduced to three as well. Mr Henry Cisneros, secretary of housing, said
60 loan programmes to cities would be consolidated into three broad block
grant categories.
The energy department, described by Mr Gore as a relic of 'the Opec and Cold
War' period, would achieve its savings by privatising the naval petroleum
reserve in California and through a variety of management and contracting
changes.
The proposals outlined yesterday will form part of the administration's
1995-96 budget, to be presented early in the year. Republican control of
Congress means that changes to this will be made.
All those who followed Mr Clinton and Mr Gore to the dias said they were
determined to make the relationship between Washington and state and local
authorities work better. But Dr Rivlin added a warning to some of the more
fervent Republican disciples of government cuts: 'There are some things
which must remain federal'.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Beijing counts the seconds until it regains Hong Kong

Tiananmen square in central Beijing has witnessed more than its share of
momentous events, but yesterday's unveiling of a clock marking the days and
seconds until Britain's handover of Hong Kong must rank as one of the more
curious.
When the clock, attached to the columns guarding the entrance to the Museum
of Revolutionary History, was unveiled by municipal officials it showed
there were 925 days and 79.92m seconds to go before the July 1 1997
deadline.
The ceremony also coincided with the 10th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-British joint declaration on the Question of Hong Kong that took place
in happier circumstances than those prevailing between Beijing and London.
Among onlookers who gathered in lightly falling snow to witness the
unveiling, the mood was nationalistic. 'With such a clock the idea of Hong
Kong returning to the motherland will enter people's hearts gradually,' said
a woman student.
The idea for the clock came from editors associated with the popular
magazine Top Brands published by the official Xinhua newsagency. Mr Li
Weimin, editor-chief of the magazine, said yesterday the clock was the 'most
appropriate' way to draw attention to the resumption of Chinese sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
'Tiananmen square is the focal point of the nation, and that is why we
suggested that a clock be placed on the square so that it can best represent
people's patriotism and elevate national spirit,' Mr Li said.
China's press, in its coverage of the joint declaration's anniversary,
highlighted remarks by Mr Qian Qichen, the foreign minister, and Mr Lu Ping,
director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, in which they hailed the
document as a 'great achievement'.
'Implementing the principle of 'one country, two systems' toward Hong Kong
after 1997 is neither an expedient measure nor a matter of being swayed by
our emotions. . . this is China's long-term state policy,' Mr Lu said. 'It
is regrettable that, in recent years, the British government has departed
from the spirit of the joint declaration, changed its policy toward the
issue of Hong Kong and adopted the way of confrontation,' Mr Lu added.
Chinese officials clearly hope the clock on Tiananmen square will reinforce
popular sentiment about the importance of re-establishing Chinese
sovereignty over Hong Kong, but a risk is that such propaganda exercises
will further sharpen antagonism with Britain. Recent discussions between
Chinese and British officials over such issues as guaranteeing the
continuity of an independent judiciary after 1997 have revealed continuing
sharp differences.
These lingering arguments do not augur well for a smooth handover.

FT  20 DEC 94 / North Korea rejects talks on downed US helicopter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday refused to hold a meeting requested by the US to
discuss the return of a US pilot and the body of his co-pilot killed in the
crash of their army helicopter in North Korea.
The announcement appeared to dash hopes that North Korea would try to
resolve the incident quickly. But, in Washington, US president Bill Clinton
said the matter was a 'high priority' and that he was working hard for its
resolution. Mr James Laney, the US ambassador to Pyongyang, said in Atlanta
he believed North Korea would release the crew quickly rather than risk
endangering relations.
North Korean officials explained that their leadership was 'too busy with
the investigation' into the incident to hold talks on the pilot's release,
according to a spokesman for the US military in Seoul.
North Korea's rejection of the US talks proposal could reflect deep
divisions within the North Korean leadership on how to resolve the issue.
The North Korean military is believed to be opposed to Pyongyang's recent
rapprochement with the US, and may try to use the incident as justification
for its stance that the US still represents a threat to the country.
The Pyongyang government recently agreed to dismantle its nuclear programme
in return for the establishment of diplomatic ties with the US. A long delay
in solving the issue of the helicopter crash will increase pressure in
Washington for the US to take a tougher stance on aid to North Korea.
The two-man OH-58 reconnaissance helicopter crashed on Saturday, three miles
north of the eastern end of the demilitarised zone that divides North from
South Korea.
The North Koreans claim that they shot down the helicopter, but the US says
that it may have had to make an emergency landing after straying across the
demilitarised zone because of a navigational error. The two-man crew
comprised chief warrant officer Bobby Hall and his co-pilot chief warrant
officer David Hilemon, who was killed.
One explanation for Pyongyang's rejection of the proposed talks could be
that the US wants to discuss the pilot's release through the military
armistice commission which supervises the truce that ended the 1950-53
Korean war.
North Korea withdrew from the commission earlier this year in an attempt to
press the US to sign a peace treaty formally ending the war, although it
still maintains low-level contacts with US military officials at the border
truce village of Panmunjom.
The resumption of commission meetings on the issue would represent a setback
to North Korea's diplomatic strategy. Mr Clinton said US congressman Bill
Richardson, who is visiting Pyongyang, was 'doing a very fine job'
representing US interests in the matter. North Korea appears to be using the
presence of Mr Richardson as a conduit to resolve the incident. Mr
Richardson, a Democratic representative from New Mexico, was originally
scheduled to hold talks on the nuclear programme accord before he was thrust
into an unexpected role of trying to arrange the return of the pilot.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Shareholders fight political funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholder groups of three leading Japanese industrial companies yesterday
took court action to stop them making corporate political donations, the
first such case in Japanese legal history.
This exemplifies growing public concern that curbs on political funding, due
to take effect at the end of the year, may contain loopholes. It shows a
small yet growing tendency among Japanese shareholders to make their voices
heard.
They are angry that many companies have over the past few weeks resumed
political donations, a year after they claimed to have closed their coffers,
ostensibly to promote cleaner politics. In the previous year, 1992,
corporate donations from all sources amounted to Y332.2bn (Pounds 2.1bn).
The companies in this case, all Osaka-based, are Obayashi, one of Japan's
five largest construction groups, Osaka Gas and Kansai Electric Power,
respectively Japan's second biggest gas and electricity suppliers. The suit,
filed on shareholders' behalf by an Osaka civil rights group, seeks to stop
the trio making donations for the Osaka governorship in next April's local
elections.
The shareholders allege the three companies contravened an election law
against giving money to politicians responsible for public works. Local
governors can select contractors for substantial civil engineering projects.
The trio are alleged to have collected Y420m from 129 local companies for a
candidate in the last gubernatorial election in 1991.
Other business groups to have started making political donations again
include the construction, oil and life insurance industry associations. The
Keidanren, the leading business federation, continues to abstain from
channelling its members' cash to political parties, but says member
organisations have kept the freedom to donate independently.
However, the party line-up has now been simplified by last week's merger of
all leading opposition parties into a single group, the New Frontier party.
This leaves Japan with a simple system of three main parties: the ruling
Liberal Democratic party, NFP and Social Democratic party.
The move has made it easier, for the first time in 18 months, for companies
to spot who needs to be paid to safeguard their interests. The construction
industry group says it is giving to both the main parties, the LDP and NFP,
the first time it has had to make a two-way political bet. Corporate
political funding is to be banned entirely in five years. Meanwhile,
donations can still be made to one registered fund-raising group per
politician.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Chinese company threatens counterclaim over Lehman's
practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS and RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China National Metals &amp; Minerals Import and Export Corporation (Minmetals),
one of the three Chinese trading companies being sued by US investment bank
Lehman Brothers over alleged unpaid debts, is threatening to sue the bank
over alleged improper and unfair business practices.
Mr Cao Yongfang, president of company subsidiary Minmetals International
Non-Ferrous Metals Trading, said: 'We have instructed our attorneys to
investigate all aspects of Lehman's dealings with our companies in order to
pursue counterclaims based upon what we believe were Lehman Brothers'
improper and unfair marketing, trading and investment advisory services.'
Lehman last month launched a suit in New York against Minmetals, China
United Petroleum Chemicals (Unipec) and China National Metals and Minerals
Import and Export (CNM) for allegedly failing to pay nearly Dollars 100m
(Pounds 61m) in debts arising from foreign exchange and swaps trading.
Minmetals' counterclaims could top by 'tens of millions' of dollars the
Dollars 52.5m, plus interest, which Lehman claims the company owes it,
according to Minmetals' lawyers. Lehman yesterday dismissed the allegations
as 'absolutely ridiculous and untrue. Just how ridiculous will become clear
as the lawsuit unfolds.'
Turning the tables on a case which some bankers saw as a hardening of
attitude by western financiers over unpaid Chinese debts, Minmetals' lawyers
claim Lehman 'lured a young and inexperienced employee' into making trades
which he was not authorised to conduct.
Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler, the US-based law firm acting for
Minmetals, claims this single employee  - who was 31 when he first started
conducting foreign exchange trades through an offshore bank account set up
at Lehman Brothers  - was granted a higher trading limit than that accorded
to the Bank of China.
In spite of his youth and inexperience, however, Minmetals Non-Ferrous
entrusted the employee concerned with sole responsibility for conducting
authorised physical and futures trades of various metals out of London on
its behalf.
Mr Franklin Chu, the partner in charge of Kaye Scholer's Asia practice based
in Hong Kong, compared Lehman's business practices unfavourably with those
of Bankers Trust, the US bank facing two lawsuits over derivatives sold to
Gibson Greetings, a US greetings card company, and Procter &amp; Gamble
multinational consumer goods company.
Minmetals Non-Ferrous foreign exchange trades, Kaye, Scholer say, were
conducted over two years. Permission to carry out such trades had already
been refused by Minmetals Non-Ferrous's president but, Mr Chu says, the
first trade was designed to overcome this obstacle. As time went on, the
lawyers allege, Lehman 'lured this young employee with progressively more
inappropriate trades'.
A Lehman executive yesterday claimed senior executives at Minmetals were
fully aware of the trading that was going on. Last year, the executive
added, the same trader had made a profit of Dollars 29m from the same
strategy.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Japan makes slow progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's campaign against costly economic regulations is starting to make
slow progress for the first time in reducing the jungle of government red
tape, William Dawkins writes.
The number of official permits and licences needed to do business in Japan,
or simply live there, fell by 457, or 4 per cent, to 10,945 in the year to
last March, reported the Management and Co-ordination Agency. It is the
first drop recorded since 1985.
Progress is slow because new regulations emerge nearly half as fast as old
ones are scrapped. Last year, for example, 829 permits were abolished, while
372 new ones were issued.
However, the pace of abolition may be increasing: 506 were scrapped in
February and March alone, under a deregulation plan launched by former prime
minister Morihiro Hosokawa.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Matsushita targets bad loans: Bank of Japan chief predicts
slow economic improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasuo Matsushita, new governor of the Bank of Japan, yesterday pledged
that resolving the banking system's bad-loan problems would be one of his
most important tasks.
Mr Matsushita, in his first public pronouncement since taking office last
week, said bad loans had peaked, 'but I am not confident that the matter has
started to improve in terms of the adjustment of corporate balance sheets.'
Attempts to recoup some of those loans by disposing of property collateral
were 'not necessarily proceeding smoothly,' he declared.
The problem would not disappear until non-performing assets could be made
more liquid and businesses and financial institutions had improved their
cash flows. Markets to clear such loans existed in the US, he added,
referring to the securitisation of bad debts, but no such system existed in
Japan. 'Interest rate problems' and complex property rights were also
factors.
While unspecific, Mr Matsushita's remarks were welcomed by equity analysts
as a sign the new governor will be sympathetic to the Japanese banking
industry's problems, and so can be expected to make the financial market's
stability a high priority.
Japan's 21 leading banks reported Y13,300bn (Pounds 85.2bn) of bad debts,
3.45 per cent of total loans, at the end of September, widely seen as a drag
on new lending. That only includes loans on which repayment is more than six
months late; the total is generally estimated to be at least double if all
restructured loans are included. Full disclosure would increase confidence
and management responsibility, but it was premature to ask banks to do this,
Mr Matsushita said.
He supported the decision of his predecessor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, to use Bank
of Japan capital, for the first time since 1927, to rescue two small credit
co-operatives. This must have been the best option, he said.
Yet the new governor appeared less optimistic on the economic outlook than
Mr Mieno, suggesting to economists in Tokyo he will be inclined to keep
short-term interest rates low.
He saw a slow economic pick-up, helped by rising industrial production and
corporate earnings and improved business sentiment, but was cautious over
the recovery's sustainability. Corporate balance sheet adjustment was
insufficient and personal consumption did not warrant optimism. 'We cannot
be too optimistic.'
He saw no big change in the current economic trend. On the strength of the
yen, cited recently by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development as the main risk to Japan's recovery, Mr Matsushita said the
best way to achieve currency stability was to seek non-inflationary
sustained economic growth.
The government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday set a 2.8 per cent
target for GDP growth in the year to the end of March 1996, slightly above
the OECD forecast and well above most private-sector predictions. At the
same time, it revised down the growth target for the year to March 1995 from
2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent, again well above most private-sector forecasts
for growth of less than 1 per cent.
The EPA expects this fiscal year's current account surplus to be higher than
earlier forecast, Dollars 127bn (Pounds 79.3bn) rather than Dollars 125bn.
That, however, marks a politically welcome decline from last year's Dollars
131.4bn. It forecasts that the surplus will go on falling next year, to
Dollars 122bn in the 12 months to March 1996.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Eastern demand lifts Cognac spirits: The industry expects
valuable markets in China and Vietnam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cognac region of south-west France is in better cheer. Producers of what
Victor Hugo described as the 'liqueur of the gods' are starting to see
stronger shipments after years of sober demand. More important, the industry
is hoping the rise of valuable new markets, notably China, will lead to a
further surge of exports.
'In the next 10 years, China has the potential to become by far the world's
biggest market,' says Mr Gilles Hennessy, vice-president of Hennessy, one of
the largest Cognac houses. 'Along with markets such as Vietnam, this is
where we see future growth.'
This is echoed by industry analysts. In a report on Remy Martin, the biggest
name in China, Mr Edouard de Boisgelin, a Merrill Lynch analyst, describes
the market as 'a new Eldorado'. He believes growth will be uneven and
vulnerable to political and economic developments, but the coastal Chinese
market could reach 29m bottles by the year 2000, against 6m at present, and
20.8m in the US, the biggest market in 1993.
For the Cognac producers, the importance of China and other new markets
reflects several factors. The Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac,
representing the 300 or so Cognac companies, says about 94 per cent of sales
comes from exports, with the lion's share accounted for by the US, Japan,
Hong Kong and western Europe. As a result, the industry depends on markets
which in many cases are mature or sluggish.
But room still exists for growth. The US has rebounded from recession to
regain its position as the number one market. Analysts also expect recovery
in Japan, badly hit by economic downturn.
'There, a lot of purchases were on corporate entertainment budgets and these
have been hit as companies have tightened their belts,' says Mr Hennessy,
whose company is the market leader. Overall sales in Japan fell to 17.4m
bottles-equivalent in the year to the end of August, from 22.3m in the same
period in 1992-1993. Price cuts have prompted improvement, but the return to
previous levels has so far proved gradual.
Despite resurgence in shipments to the US, and Japan's recovery prospects,
few observers see rapid growth in existing markets. New markets are
prompting the enthusiasm. 'Emerging markets such as China are the main
hope,' one analyst at a French bank said. This hope is partly justified by
the Chinese market's rapid growth. 'The Chinese have always had a taste for
Cognac,' says Mr Hennessy.
Whether the appetites of the Chinese consumer and the Cognac companies will
be satisfied depends on progress in resolving the obstacles. Most important
are the high taxes facing importers of liquors and spirits. Tariffs increase
the cost of a bottle of Cognac by about 150 per cent; taxes take the total
price rise to almost 250 per cent. Import barriers are an important element
in talks on China's membership of the World Trade Organisation, successor to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which comes into effect at the
start of next year.
One Cognac executive said progress was being made, partly because Beijing
was seeking to curb the black market through which most Cognac at present
enters China. But the gap between the Chinese offers on tariff cuts and the
demands of the international spirits industry still remains to be bridged.
Partly because of high tariffs and taxes, emerging markets in Asia, Russia
and Latin America remain vulnerable to counterfeit producers. But things
have improved somewhat over the past two years, one senior executive in the
industry says. In Thailand, he estimates counterfeit Cognac now represents a
few per cent of the market, against up to 30 per cent a few years ago.
Steps are being taken to limit the problem in the new markets. In China,
Hennessy has agreed to set up a laboratory with Chinese partners to root out
counterfeit products. The company believes such moves will help smooth
access for French producers, but the process may take a long time. Given the
market's potential size, the wait would seem worth it.

Vox, the ailing German television station in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation has a 49.9 per cent stake, will spend DM200m (Pounds 81.6m) on
its programming next year. The channel was started at the beginning of 1993
by Bertelsmann, the German media group, but went into liquidation last April
when a number of the original shareholders withdrew. Several of Germany's 16
state media authorities were reluctant to renew the Vox licence after the
channel went into liquidation, arguing that Mr Murdoch's arrival in July
meant the new shareholders and programme mix bore no resemblance to the
original channel. However, a spokesman for Vox, said the media regulators
had approved the new line-up.

Russia's emerging capitalists are again searching for a constructive role in

yesterday to form an association to represent their interests more
effectively. The First Congress of Russian Businessmen called on the
government to stiffen its plans for a tight 1995 budget, to stabilise the
economy, to reduce inflation, cut government spending and reform the tax
regime. Representatives asked the government to encourage a more favourable
investment climate, making it possible to channel private money into parts
of the manufacturing sector which stood 'on the brink of destruction'.

The Czech government yesterday cleared the way for Volkswagen to increase
its stake in Skoda Automobilova by approving a controversial amendment to a
1991 agreement. The amendment allows Volkswagen to take its stake in Skoda
from 31 per cent to 60.3 per cent by the end of this year and to 70 per cent
by the end of 1995, for a total cost of DM1.4bn. But the new agreement also
accepts a substantial cut in Volkswagen's overall investment from an
anticipated DM9.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn) when the original contract was signed,
to Dm3.7bn. In return, Volkswagen has agreed to expand Skoda's production
capacity to 340,000 cars a year by 2000 from 230,000 currently and to
introduce a new family-type car based on a Volkswagen design.

France's Council on Competition is expected to rule next spring on a
preliminary report that the country's main public contractors have
systematically rigged bids on highways, bridges and high-speed TGV rail
track contracts over the past few years. According to the preliminary
report, which has been leaked to the Canard Enchaine investigative weekly,
the Council on Competition has uncovered 27 alleged cases of market and
price rigging by some 50 companies, including Bouygues, Generale des Eaux
and Lyonnaise des Eaux. The companies now have two months to respond to the
allegations, before the Council prepares its final report, which could
recommend sizeable fines.

The British foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday moved to reassure
Gibraltar over its status as a UK colony ahead of talks with his Spanish
counterpart, Mr Javier Solana. Mr Hurd said the UK remained committed to the
Gibraltarian constitution which states there can be no change in the
colony's status without the consent of the local people. Spain said last
week it planned to resurrect suggestions for a leaseback of Gibraltar, or a
sharing of sovereignty, when the annual bilateral meeting on the future of
the British colony takes place in London today. However, Gibraltar's chief
minister, Mr Joe Bossano, yesterday separately raised the stakes for the
talks by accusing both London and Madrid of destabilising his
administration.

One of the shadowiest episodes of the period in office of Mr Felipe
Gonzalez', the Spanish prime minister, is expected to be unravelled
following the arrest of a senior member of the governing Socialist party in
connection with a right-wing death squad that waged an undercover war
against Basque separatists in the 1980s.
Ms Margarita Robles, the interior ministry's secretary of state, told the
Madrid parliament yesterday that a high court judge had ordered the arrest
of Mr Julian Sancristobal, a senior government official in the Basque
Country between 1982 and 1984, director general of state security between
1984 and 1986 and subsequently a member of the Socialist party's policy
council. Ms Robles said the arrest of Mr Sancristobal, together with three
police officers, had been ordered by Judge Baltasar Garzon on charges of
attempted murder, kidnapping and misuse of public funds.
Mr Mario Conde, the former chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto),
who was indicted on fraud charges last month, was interrogated yesterday by
a Madrid investigating judge. The questioning, which centres on the collapse
a year ago of Banesto, then the fourth-ranked Spanish bank continued late
into the night and is expected to continue today.

<TEXT>
The Italian government was further undermined yesterday by the prospect of
ministers from the populist Northern League resigning in advance of
tomorrow's no-confidence vote in parliament.
At least three of the five League ministers said they preferred to resign
their portfolios before voting against the right-wing coalition of which
they formed part.
Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, finance minister, went further and became the first
minister to criticise openly Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, by
claiming 'he lacked the ability to run the government'.
But Mr Berlusconi still won support  - albeit lukewarm  - from Mr Roberto
Maroni, interior minister and the most influential League figure in the
cabinet.
Backers of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, were gathering signatures
from among the deputies within the movement yesterday to check those willing
to vote against the government.
Mr Bossi has tested the loyalty of a sizeable number of deputies by turning
towards the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) as a
potential ally. Others are concerned that, since their election was due to
strong backing from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, they cannot
easily break this link without betraying the electorate.
However, the League is aware that the government has little chance of
survival. The party's stance will be crucial for the eight-month-old
government in the three no-confidence motions due to be debated on
consecutive days.
The financial markets registered their concern over the increasing
instability by forcing the lira to fall close to another psychological
barrier  - L1,050 to the D-Mark.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Carter claims ceasefire offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PALE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jimmy Carter, the US peace mediator, yesterday claimed that the Bosnian
Serbs had agreed an immediate ceasefire and that they were willing to
discuss the international peace plan.
However, late last night, Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs,
disagreed with the former US president's interpretation of their talks which
were held in Pale, the Bosnian Serb capital. Mr Karadzic said there would
not be an immediate ceasefire but that he was willing to explore such a
possibility.
In advance of the talks Mr Carter stirred up controversy when he said that
Bosnian Serbs wanted peace and that Americans 'have primarily heard one side
of the story': that the Bosnian Serbs were the aggressors.
The White House, which has been sceptical of Mr Carter's latest peace foray
and has emphasised that it is not an official mission, immediately disputed
his assertion about which side was the aggressor. 'The Bosnian Serbs are the
aggressors in this war,' a White House spokeswoman said. 'I think the
American people have had an opportunity to see what's happening on the
ground there and to see both sides of the story.'
Mr Carter said after several hours of talks with Mr Karadzic, who had
invited him to undertake his mission, that he would return to Sarajevo to
put what he understood to be a ceasefire proposal to the Moslem-led Bosnian
government. Mr Carter said: 'The Bosnian Serb side agreed to an immediate
ceasefire and to negotiate a lasting cessation of hostilities.'
There was also controversy over whether the Bosnian Serbs had fulfilled
earlier pledges they gave Mr Carter. Since Mr Karadzic issued his promises
last week, Serb forces have attacked peacekeepers and civilian targets in
Sarajevo, blocked UN convoys and expelled more civilians from Serb-held
territory, UN officials said.
The Bosnian Serbs say publicly they have limited expectations from Mr
Carter's visit. But officials hint privately that the leadership in Pale may
be close to accepting a revised version of peace proposals first presented
by the five-member contact group in the summer. The original plan, they
believe, called on the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw from territory before talks
on complex issues such as agreed land swaps and links between the Bosnian
Serbs and what remains of Yugoslavia.
'The contact group plan has been changed,' an official said. The latest
version makes it clear that only a ceasefire and verbal commitment are
needed before negotiations begin. He said what the Serbs wanted was 'near to
independence. We are not looking for a seat at the UN. Our idea is to unite
with Serbia'. Unity would not preclude close economic and administrative
ties with the rest of Bosnia, he said. His remarks appeared at variance with
the frequent public insistence that only full, internationally recognised
sovereignty would satisfy Bosnia's Serbs.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Economic Watch: Swiss industrial output falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swiss industrial production was 6 per cent ahead in the third quarter and
new orders were 12 per cent higher than in the third quarter of 1993,
according to the Federal Statistics Office. Industrial production, however,
slipped 4.4 per cent in the third quarter from the second quarter. Export
orders were 13 per cent higher year-on-year and 3.6 per cent ahead of the
second quarter rate. A machinery industry spokesman said demand was
strengthening, but export orders were being taken on very thin margins
because of the strength of the Swiss franc. The improvement also reflected
unavoidable restocking following the long recession, especially in the
metal-working and watchmaking sectors. Domestic orders jumped as the January
1 implementation of a value added tax approached. Its effect will be to
reduce the cost of capital goods. Domestic orders were up 10 per cent
year-on-year, 1.8 per cent higher than in the second quarter.
Sweden's State Audit Office revised downwards its estimate for the budget
deficit and government borrowing requirement in the current budget year. The
audit office said tax increases and spending cuts announced in November
would help lower the budget deficit in the 1994-95, July-June fiscal year to
SKr189bn (Pounds 16bn) from the SKr201bn it estimated in October. The
borrowing requirement was now expected to total SKr227bn, compared with the
previous estimate of SKr242bn. However, the new figures still show a budget
deficit equivalent to more than 12 per cent of gross national product and
are unlikely to ease the pressure on Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister,
to produce a further round of deep spending cuts in his 1995-96 budget
proposals due next month.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Brussels talks seek end to fish row with Spain

European Union expansion from 12 to 15 nation-states from January 1 was
still at risk last night, as the EU struggled to agree the terms of Spain's
full integration into the Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).
EU fisheries ministers were meeting in Brussels in an effort to put flesh on
the bones of the tacit agreement brokered by the current German presidency
of the EU at last week's summit of European leaders in Essen.
But differences over details of Spanish access to waters west of the UK and
Ireland, and over control mechanisms on over-fishing of diminishing stocks,
were still far from being resolved, EU negotiators said. The Spanish
government has said it will not complete ratification of enlargement  - set
to bring Austria, Sweden, and Finland into the Union in January  - unless
the CFP issue is settled.
Spain and Portugal were promised in March that they would be fully
integrated into the CFP by January 1996  - six years ahead of the date
agreed in 1986 when the Iberian countries became member states.
All member states agreed that if new member states were to get full rights
then restrictions on the Spanish fleet  - the EU's largest  - could no
longer be justified.
Last spring's enlargement talks were in great part dominated by Spain's
objections to allowing Norway to gain EU entry on terms far better than
those offered to the Iberians. Norway is one of Europe's leading fishing
powers, but, in the event, its people voted against membership.
But Spain insists that a political deal was struck in March, and its
parliament has told the Madrid government not to formalise ratification
unless it is now delivered.
At Essen, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez
are understood to have reached an agreement whereby there would be no
discrimination against Spanish fishing vessels. Translating this into
practice is, however, running up against a barrier of national interests.
The UK and Ireland want to keep the Spanish fleet as far as possible out of
the waters west of their two countries  - the so-called 'Irish Box' which
Spanish fishermen traditionally know as the 'Gran Sol'  - while France also
wants to restrict Spanish access in the Bay of Biscay, a traditional tuna
and anchovy ground for Spain's northern fleet.
Spain is currently subject to restrictions which allow 150 out of a list of
300 vessels into the Irish box at any one time. In a hardline document
delivered to yesterday's meeting, Spain made clear it would not tolerate any
restrictions which are not simultaneously applied to other EU fishing
vessels.

FT  20 DEC 94 / EU stalls on customs union with Turks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ankara's hopes of sealing a customs pact with the European Union look
certain to remain unfulfilled before the end of the year after EU ministers
last night raised concerns over human rights abuses against Turkey's Kurdish
minority and Greece maintained its opposition to a formal deal.
The customs union, which would open the European market to Turkey and bring
its trading system into line with the EU's, is now unlikely to be signed
until early next year.
It is understood that Greece will not drop its opposition to the pact until
a date has been set for the start of negotiations to bring Cyprus into the
EU. This is expected next year, after the EU observer on Cyprus has produced
a report outlining progress made in talks between the island's Greek and
Turkish communities.
In a separate development at the meeting in Brussels yesterday, foreign
ministers gave their final approval to the Uruguay Round trade accord, plus
legislation required to implement it.
The 12 agreed to send the necessary papers  - which will be formally signed
on Thursday  - to Geneva on December 30, by which time all member states
should have ratified the package. France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and
Greece have still not completed ratification, but senior Commission
officials are confident all the necessary documents will reach Geneva by the
30th.
During the meeting  - the last foreign affairs council to be held under the
German presidency  - EU ministers told their Turkish counterpart, Mr Murat
Karayalcin, that they were concerned about the treatment of Turkey's Kurdish
population, in particular the decision earlier this month to jail eight
Kurdish MPs.
However, they stressed that groundwork for the customs union had been
agreed, with only the political issues of human rights and Greece's concerns
over Cyprus standing in the way. Turkey is also due to receive Ecu600m
(Pounds 472.2m) in financial aid from the EU, but this too has been blocked
by Athens.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said it was extremely important to
maintain a partnership with Turkey. 'Whether one thinks of the Balkans or
the dialogue on human rights, or the Soviet Union, or the Middle East, or
Cyprus, relations with Turkey are indispensable.' Against a background of
noisy Kurdish demonstrations outside the Council building in Brussels, Mr
Hurd defended Turkish efforts to improve their record on human rights.
'The Turks are taking quite substantial measures to legislate on human
rights,' he said, adding that the rights cause would not be advanced 'one
jot' by refusing a customs union.
Ministers also gave their final approval to an international agreement to
ban subsidies to European shipbuilders. This deal was completed after the
French, in earlier talks, were given special exemptions to ensure that
politically sensitive shipyards were protected.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Bundesbank holds the key to festive mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
As Christmas approaches, the Bundesbank is making those who analyse its
every action wait a little before they can relax into festive mood.
First, they will have to digest all the German central bank has to offer
this week in the way of economic analysis, monetary performance and policy
targets.
Among economists, a debate is raging as to whether the German central bank
will start raising official interest rates soon, wait until late next year
or beyond, or manage one more reduction in the present economic cycle. They
are hoping for clues when the Bundesbank announces its 1995 money supply
target on Thursday. Most economists expect gradual rises in rates from the
second half of next year; a cut at this stage would unsettle bond markets.
Yesterday, the bank offered some seasonal cheer with its monthly report.
This highlighted the strength of the economic upturn, welcomed the fall in
the public sector deficit - expected to decrease by some DM20bn (Pounds
8.1bn) this year to around DM115bn - and said west German inflation could
decline to below 2.5 per cent early next year.
Figures are also expected shortly showing that growth in M3, the broad
monetary aggregate, eased further to an annualised rate of just over 6 per
cent in November. This would still leave M3 slightly above the 1994 target
range of between 4 and 6 per cent, but mark the continuation of a huge
improvement on the overblown growth rates in the first half of the year.
At Thursday's meeting, therefore, the consensus is that the target level for
1995 will be roughly the same.
But beyond that, economists' opinions diverge sharply. The Bundesbank has
calmed markets by holding open all possibilities.
'The hope that something could come in the way of rate cuts has never been
taken from the market,' noted Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at
BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. The last reduction in official rates was in May, when
the discount and Lombard rates were cut by half a percentage point each to
4.5 and 6 per cent respectively.
Then, the aim was to slow the alarming acceleration in M3 growth by
encouraging investors to move funds from short-term deposits to longer term
instruments. 'Looking back on 1994,' added Mr Remsperger, 'I would say the
Bundesbank's experiment of using rate cuts to brake money supply growth has
succeeded.'
Ms Alison Cottrell, London-based economist at Kidder Peabody of the US, also
believes the Bundesbank is trying to keep markets happy.
'They want to keep the hope of rate cuts alive all the time. That's the
reason they're not cutting.' Nor does she see any pressing reason for
further reductions now. She expects renewed tightening in late summer or
autumn next year.
Neither she nor Mr Remsperger totally exclude the possibility of a cut early
next year, though.
Among those arguing strongly for such a move is Dresdner Bank. 'There
remains a good chance that the Bundesbank will cut the discount rate once
again,' the bank's research arm said. Admitting its view was controversial,
it cited the improving monetary and inflation situation (including the
prospect of moderate wage deals).
Taking the opposite view is Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Its
Frankfurt-based economists have criticised the Bundesbank's rate cuts and
what they call its 'liberal interpretation' of the monetary target in 1994.
Thus they see the need for 'a moderate increase in official interest rates
in the course of 1995'.
Mr Remsperger sees the truth as lying someway between the two. For him, the
importance of Thursday's meeting will be more in what the Bundesbank says
about M3 performance and targets than in the actual figures. 'An unchanged
M3 goal will send the message that the Bundesbank takes account of the
overshooting of the target and intends to correct this.'
Although the link between M3 and future inflation is not always clear, some
economists feel the Bundesbank should tighten policy early as a precaution
against any speeding up of inflation in 1996. Mr Martin Hufner, economist at
Bayerische Vereinsbank, says interest rates should go up in the first half
of 1995.
For Ms Cottrell, however, it will be fiscal policy that determines when, and
if, rates rise next year. If both the consolidation of the federal budget
and wage trends look like getting out of hand, she thinks the Bundesbank
could use interest rate rises as a 'psychological tool' to knock sense into
politicians and wage bargainers.
Undoubtedly, the central bank continues to take M3 seriously, despite
criticism from those who feel it has wavered from the true monetary path.
Thus the Bundesbank is likely to underscore its commitment to monetary
targeting when it sets its 1995 range for M3 on Thursday. Then the Christmas
celebrations can begin.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Socialists' win in Bulgaria lifts hope for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SOFIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bulgarian Socialist party won a decisive victory in Sunday's
parliamentary elections, preliminary results show. Calculations based on 95
per cent of the vote give the BSP, the successors to the Communist party,
43.5 per cent support and an outright majority of more than 120 seats in the
240-seat chamber.
Mr Zhan Videnov, BSP leader, who is expected to become prime minister, said
he would try to form a broad coalition government. However, other parties
have so far ruled out co-operation with the former communists.
The last election in October 1991 was won by the Union of Democratic Forces,
a broad anti-communist alliance, but it fell from office after losing a vote
of no-confidence in October 1992. A non-party government of technocrats took
over, led by Mr Lyuben Berov and supported in parliament by BSP votes and a
collection of breakaway parties from the UDF.
On Sunday the UDF won only about 24 per cent of the vote and 69 seats,
compared with 34 per cent support and 110 seats in 1991. At that election
the BSP won 33 per cent of the vote and 106 seats.
Under Bulgaria's electoral rules, only parties which gain more than 4 per
cent support win representation in parliament. In Sunday's turnout of more
than 75 per cent, the Popular Union attracted more than 6 per cent of the
vote, the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF) won more than 5
per cent, and the Bulgarian Business Block took just under 5 per cent.
Monarchist parties failed to gain entry to parliament, as did the Democratic
Alternative for the Republic, a small coalition of centre-left parties.
Both the UDF and the MRF have appealed to the anti-communist forces to
combine their efforts to become an alternative to the Socialists.
Bulgaria now has an opportunity for stable government by a Socialist party
which is internally divided but which is likely to be dominated by pragmatic
reformers who accept the need for a market economy and privatisation. In
this Bulgaria is following a pattern in central Europe, where pragmatic
wings of Socialist parties in Poland, Hungary and Lithuania have gained the
upper hand.
However, unlike these countries, where economic reforms are well advanced,
Bulgaria has a long way to go. A report by the IMF's representative in Sofia
revealed last week that Bulgaria is expected to have the highest rate of
inflation and the lowest real economic growth in eastern Europe next year.
According to the report, the reasons for this disappointing outcome are the
long delays in implementing necessary structural reforms, combined with
mistakes in macro-economic policy.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Major takes firm line with rebels: PM says Eurosceptic MPs
will not regain whip 'for months'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major said yesterday that he would make peace with the Conservative
party's rebels over Europe only on his own terms, as he issued a strong
appeal for party unity.
Rejecting calls from the Tory right for a speedy reconciliation, the prime
minister said it would be months before he would consider lifting the
suspension from the parliamentary party of nine Eurosceptic MPs.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Major said it would be 'unwise'
to rule out a referendum either after the European Union's 1996
intergovernmental conference or on the issue of a single currency.
But he did not expect the 1996 conference to lead to a further institutional
upheaval in the Union, adding: 'I do not expect to come back with anything
that would justify a referendum.'
Mr Major suggested there would be a stronger case for a referendum on a
single European currency but said there was no possibility of economic and
monetary union in 1997 and only a small chance of such a move in 1999.
In a wide-ranging review of the political and economic outlook, Mr Major
played down speculation that the government might legislate to prevent large
increases in boardroom salaries. Some of the recent increases in directors'
pay had been 'insensitive' but there were serious obstacles to legislation.
The prime minister dismissed also the calls from some Tory MPs and ministers
for early and large tax cuts to improve the government's standing in the
opinion polls. He said he was '100 per cent' behind Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, in his insistence that taxes would be reduced only when the
economy could afford it.
Speaking in Downing Street at the end of a year that has seen his
premiership repeatedly under fire as Labour's lead has soared in the opinion
polls, the prime minister dismissed the sniping from the Tory backbenches.
Stressing his commitment to sustained economic recovery, peace in Northern
Ireland and a radical overhaul of public services, Mr Major said he did not
believe 'that it is the loudest voice that carries furthest; it is often the
still voice that lasts right the way through the storm'.
Mr Major issued another strong call for unity in the Tory party to allow the
government to reap the political rewards of the economic upturn: 'Divided
parties, as we have seen in British history, have great difficulty in
winning general elections.' It would be 'folly running off the Richter
scale' if the Conservatives threw away the opportunity of 'the best economic
recovery in living memory'.
But Mr Major was absolutely clear that the nine Tory MPs suspended since
last month's rebellion over the European Union budget would not be
readmitted unless they demonstrated their support for the government.
Assuming they voted for the government 'over the months ahead', he would
consider whether they should be readmitted to the party whip. Mr Major
added: 'But it is not imminent at all, they must show that they are in the
business of supporting the government.'
Ready to ride out the storm:

FT  20 DEC 94 / Soap wars force delay in board changes at Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's problems with its revolutionary new detergents appeared yesterday
to have disrupted the orderly succession to the Anglo-Dutch group's top job.
The company announced a postponement of previously announced boardroom
changes amid mounting evidence that Persil Power and Omo Power, the
detergents launched this spring, have failed to meet their targets.
Unilever spent some Pounds 200m to bring its most ambitious new product in
15 years to market. But it has made no dent in the sales of Procter &amp;
Gamble, its American rival, which has about 35 per cent of the Pounds 6bn a
year European detergents market against Unilever's 22 per cent.
P&amp;G launched an unprecedented public campaign against the product, which
Unilever had hoped would help it recapture the lead in European detergents
it lost to P&amp;G in the 1980s.
Unilever said that Mr Niall FitzGerald, vice-chairman of Unilever plc, the
British half of the Anglo-Dutch group, and head of its detergents business,
would not be joining the special committee, the triumvirate that runs
Unilever, as planned after next May's annual meeting.
His move to the special committee, announced last December, had been widely
seen as a precursor to his taking over from Sir Michael Perry, chairman of
Unilever plc, who is due to retire in May 1996.
Mr FitzGerald 'has expressed the wish to continue as detergents co-ordinator
for a further period', Unilever said. He would now join the committee in
1996.
The delay means the special committee will be down to two men for up to two
years, an unprecedented situation in Unilever's 64-year history.
The two special committee members are Sir Michael and Mr Morris Tabaksblat,
chairman of Unilever NV, the Dutch arm. The third person is almost always
heir apparent to one of the co-chairmen.
Mr FitzGerald, a 49-year-old Irishman, would be the youngest chairman in
Unilever's history.
'Nothing has changed except the timing,' a senior businessman close to
Unilever said yesterday. 'He wants a year pressing the flesh to reassure the
troops.'
It would be unusual, however, for a new chairman to take up his post without
serving on the special committee. Asked whether the change meant Sir Michael
would extend his tenure, Unilever said:'That would depend on events and
needs.'
The original version of the new Power detergent, sold as Persil in the UK
and Omo on the Continent, was criticised for damaging some fabrics. The
group was forced to change the formulation after a flaw made it react to
some dyes.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Government to reassess plans for new roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to review more than two-thirds of its road-building
programme following the publication yesterday of a report which found new
roads could lead to increased traffic.
Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said 270 road schemes which are at
planning stage would now undergo extra assessment to judge their overall
impact on traffic levels.
In addition, he said future road spending would be concentrated on improving
the existing network. Seven big projects, including controversial proposals
for the A34 Newbury bypass, would be dropped from the government's existing
programme of about 360 road schemes.
The report, drawn up by the standing advisory committee on trunk road
assessment  - a group of independent experts  - says present methods of
assessing road schemes can lead to an exaggerated view of their benefits. It
concludes that government methods for assessing such schemes underestimate
the impact of 'induced traffic'  - journeys made only because the building
or improvement of a road makes them possible.
'We conclude that induced traffic can and does occur, probably quite
extensively, though its size and significance is likely to vary widely in
different circumstances,' the committee said.
The committee's findings could lead to a fundamental review of the methods
used to assess road schemes. Mr Mawhinney said he would commission research
to improve the department's techniques. 'I am determined that important
decisions on the road schemes are taken on the basis of the best and most
up-to-date methods of forecasting their effects,' he said.
Environmental groups welcomed the report, saying it confirmed their view
that building new roads simply encouraged more people to drive.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, said the findings challenged
a method of assessment which was 'rigged in favour of road building'.
The British Road Federation, however, said the report showed new roads
encouraged economic activity and that most of the traffic on new roads had
transferred from less suitable routes.
The publication of the advisory committee report, which was filed with the
transport department nearly nine months ago, follows a call earlier this
month by Mr Mawhinney for a public debate about transport issues.
The department had been criticised by anti-road lobbyists for trying to
prevent publication.
The announcement on what the government termed a 're-focusing' of its roads
programme follows cuts of Pounds 400m over the next two years in the
department's roads budget.
Programmes to relieve bottlenecks on the M1 and M25, and the M1-M62 link,
will go ahead.

FT  20 DEC 94 / BOC takes lead in giving more details on directors' pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy surrounding top directors' pay has prompted BOC Group and
other leading companies to give shareholders more information about
executive packages.
BOC's annual report and accounts, sent to shareholders at the weekend, gives
full details for the first time of every director's remuneration package,
including pensions and share options.
The industrial gases company has so far moved furthest in providing pay
details. The group's chairman, Mr Richard Giordano, is also chairman of
British Gas, which has been at the heart of concerns over executive pay.
Next month, Grand Metropolitan, the food and drink conglomerate, is expected
to provide a similar level of detail in its accounts. 'We will go further
than ever before,' Grand Met said yesterday. Mr Giordano also sits on the
Grand Met board.
Earlier this year, Dixons, the electrical retail group, and Reuters, the
information services group, led the way by giving shareholders a far greater
amount of information on directors' pay than necessary under company law.
The government is examining the issue of executive pay after public anger at
recent large increases.
This follows the disclosure that Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British
Gas, had received a 75 per cent pay rise.
Mr Giordano has pledged British Gas will also give far more details on
directors' pay in its next annual report and accounts.
One leading BOC shareholder termed the new level of information the
'Giordano effect' and said: 'We can only welcome what he is getting
companies to do.'
The BOC report and accounts contains five pages of details on the directors'
pay packages, including details of each director's pension, in line with
information routinely given to shareholders in the US.
For example, the total benefit accrued to date for Dr Debajyoti Chatterji,
managing director of technology, has a lump sum value of Pounds 115,000.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Directors confirmed yesterday that it would be
issuing new guidelines on executive pay in the new year. It is likely to
stress that companies should make full disclosure of directors' pay details
and also recommend shorter service contracts.

FT  20 DEC 94 / Carter claims ceasefire deal in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Former US president Jimmy Carter claimed yesterday that the Bosnian Serbs
were willing to begin an immediate ceasefire and to discuss the
international peace plan for the former Yugoslavian republic.
Mr Carter, with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic during their talks at
the Serbian stronghold of Pale, said: 'The Bosnian Serb side agreed to an
immediate ceasefire and to negotiate a lasting cessation of hostilities.'
However, Mr Karadzic denied that his side had agreed to any ceasefire,
though he said he was willing to explore such a possibility. Mr Carter is
visiting Bosnia at Mr Karadzic's invitation in an effort to break the
deadlock in the peace negotiations.
The US administration has been sceptical of Mr Carter's latest peace foray
and has emphasised it is not an official mission.

Commission of Human Rights said. The ruling could affect the futures of the

FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week and Next): France outlines final
stage of sale process - Bull
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government will this week inform those companies that have made
preliminary bids for a stake in Groupe Bull whether they can go on to
examine the books of the state-controlled computer company to make a final
offer by mid-February.
The industry ministry has said that it has been decided after all not to
announce a shortlist by Christmas of companies 'pre-selected' for the final
stage of the operation. It indicated that some companies had wanted to keep
their interest in Bull confidential, and the government would respect this.
By contrast, Quadral, a French electronics company, has said it made a bid,
which is reported to be in the form of a joint offer with AT&amp;T of the US,
while NEC of Japan has shown interest in increasing its existing 4.34 per
cent stake in Bull.
The industry ministry said that from now until mid-February it would be up
to the companies concerned to reveal their interest in Bull if they wanted
to. According to some sources, the Bull privatisation has drawn interest
from several non-Japanese Asian groups such as Samsung of South Korea and
Acer of Taiwan.
The government wants to reduce its 76 per cent stake in Bull, headed by
chairman Jean-Marie Descarpentries (pictured above right), to a minority
holding by next spring. But, given that Bull is still losing money - though
on a reduced scale - the government is seeking privatisation through the
formation of industrial partnerships rather than a public offer for sale.
It has said it is looking either for a majority shareholder or several
important shareholders each taking at least 10 per cent of the capital. It
has equally said that new partners could subscribe new capital, so diluting
the the state's stake, or they could buy shares off the state.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Blackouts in Algiers after saboteurs hit power supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Algiers has suffered serious electrical power difficulties for three days
because of sabotage to the Algerian capital's power supply, according to
Algerian officials, Agencies report.
A 'serious incident' cut power last Wednesday night and remaining power was
being rationed among city districts, Sonelgaz, the state-run electricity
supplier, said at the weekend. The problem could continue for some time, it
added.
Government officials, who refused to be named, said five towers carrying
electricity lines had been blown up in Zemmouri, east of Algiers. There was
no claim of responsibility by last night.
Algerian television reported that a big food warehouse supplying Algiers,
Boumerdes to the east and Tipasa to the west was destroyed by armed men who
planted bombs and set it on fire.
According to the television, monitored by the BBC, an unidentified group of
some 40 attackers planted the bombs throughout the building, which contained
huge stocks of dried milk, medicines and domestic electrical appliances.
Algeria says more than 10,000 people have been killed in the civil strife
since January 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election that
fundamentalists were poised to win.
Sabotage has accounted for Dollars 2bn in damage between February 1992 and
December 1993, according to the government.

FT  19 DEC 94 / All white-collar criminals in Malaysia to be caned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Malaysian government says it will make caning a mandatory punishment for
white-collar crimes.
Mr Syed Hamid Albar, the law minister, said white-collar crime had grown
considerably in recent years and accounted for 15 per cent of all crimes
reported. However, white-collar criminals did not cause their victims
physical injury so the canings administered to them would not be as severe
as those delivered to other violent offenders.
Mr Hamid said businessmen, bureaucrats, company employees and lawyers were
among those convicted of crimes. Caning in Malaysia and Singapore is carried
out with a thick bamboo stick or rotan and causes intense pain, often
splitting the skin.
The Malaysian cabinet also approved a plan to do away with all trials by
jury because of increasing difficulty in finding juries for long trials.
Malaysia's GDP grew by an annual rate of 8.9 per cent in the third quarter
of the year, according to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister. In each of
the two previous quarters GDP grew by 8.3 per cent on an annualised basis.
Mr Anwar said inflation in the third quarter had moderated to 3.2 per cent.
However last week Malaysia's central bank said inflation for the first 10
months of the year was 3.7 per cent.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl will today throw his political weight behind a
decision to send German Tornado fighter bombers to Bosnia by telling MPs
that Germany owes it to its allies to become involved in former Yugoslavia,
writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn.
In an interview with Bild Zeitung, Germany's best-selling newspaper, Mr Kohl
appealed to deputies, who must approve any deployment, to set aside their
party affiliations and listen to their consciences.
The cabinet is expected to decide tomorrow whether it will send the
aircraft, medical facilities, engineers and naval units. Two German navy
frigates are already part of a fleet enforcing an embargo. However,
officials said Germany would continue to resist pressure to send combat
troops.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Congress leaders outline tax cut scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leading Republicans yesterday outlined an aggressive programme to cut both
US government and taxes, promising to move swiftly in January to reduce
spending before moving on to tax relief measures.
'We will do more in the first 100 days than has been done in the last 10
years in this town,' Mr Dick Armey, the incoming House majority leader, said
on television.
He and Congressman John Kasich, incoming House budget committee chairman,
again attempted to seize the initiative from President Bill Clinton, who
offered a tax reduction scheme on Thursday. They said the House, immediately
after convening, would create an 'American tax relief savings account' which
would hold the savings from programme cuts to pay for tax reductions.
'Nobody on Main Street and no-one on Wall Street is going to think we're
going to give out the goodies without cutting government first,' Mr Kasich
said. They would move immediately to lower previous budget caps and force
appropriation subcommittees to make spending reductions. Those savings would
go into the special 'bank', Mr Kasich said.
'Whenever we pass any of these incentives, like the family tax relief
programme, we'll draw down the bank.'
Republican Senator Bob Packwood, incoming chairman of the finance committee,
predicted Congress would pass a 'balanced budget' amendment to the US
constitution by April. He forecast this would win approval by the state
legislatures next summer. Various versions of the amendment would require a
balanced budget in five to seven years.
Senator Pete Domenici, incoming budget committee chairman, said there would
be 'a revolution in this country', with scores of programmes eliminated or
cut.
'I've got the longest list in town,' said Mr Armey, suggesting the
Departments of Energy and Education could be eliminated and the Commerce
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency severely reduced.
The Republicans - who said they had two or three budgets already prepared -
indicated a willingness to work with Mr Clinton. His tax cut plan would be
considered, said Mr Bill Archer, a Texas Republican. 'He came late to the
dance, but he's on the dance floor and we welcome that.'
They would back a temporary line item veto, for perhaps four to six years,
to enable the president to cut individual items of 'fat' from the budget.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (17): Facilities stretched by
the tourist rush - Visitors numbers are swelling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guide books gushingly refer to Prague as the Golden City, but it was a grey
and shabby place five years ago when it emerged from four decades of
communist neglect.
Apart from a six-lane motorway running along the top of Wenceslas Square,
the communists left the city centre structurally more or less unscathed and
spent their money building monolithic blocks of panelak high-rise apartments
in the suburbs.
But by the time of the Velvet Revolution 50 years of neglect had left the
city's urban fabric in urgent need of repair. Many monuments and fine
buildings were propped up by rickety scaffolding whose main function was to
prevent pedestrians being injured by falling tiles or gutters.
Now, thanks to the restoration of private property, private capital is
leading a reconstruction boom. Streets that even two years ago were dull and
lifeless have been transformed by new shops, restaurants and cafes. The
city's generally relaxed atmosphere is immeasurably enhanced by its beauty.
The investment is paying off. Tourists are flocking to the Czech Republic in
unprecedented numbers, and the industry has become one of the country's
biggest foreign exchange earners. In the first nine months of this year,
according to the Czech National Bank, 76m people visited the country, more
than in all of last year. Tourist earnings in that period also soared to a
record Dollars 1.51bn, compared to Dollars 1.57bn for the whole of 1993.
Tourist traffic moves in both directions. Czech tourists spent Dollars 900m
abroad over the same period, nearly double the amount in all of 1993,
although the CNB warns that the figure includes for the first time the value
of consumer goods brought back by returning locals.
In 1989, the last year of communist control, tourist receipts amounted to
less than Dollars 250m. By 1991 the figure had swelled to Dollars 700m and
exceeded Dollars 1bn in 1992. Last year's receipts represent about 5 per
cent of gross domestic product and the proportion in 1994 is likely to be
substantially higher.
These figures are impressive for a country that on an official level does
not take the tourist industry seriously. The Czech Tourist Authority, set up
only last year, is run on a shoestring from dingy offices on the Old Town
Square, in the heart of Prague's historic centre. It has just seven staff
and two offices abroad, in Berlin and Vienna, although more are planned.
Karel Nejdl, the authority's director, says the official attitude is that
the Czech Republic already receives enough tourists and that encouraging
more would simply push overstretched amenities to breaking point.
The tourist industry's main problem, Mr Nejdl says, is not government
indifference but a dearth of quality accommodation. Prague has 38,000 hotel
beds and can count on 12,000 rooms in private accommodation, but many of
them are rudimentary. Plans to build at least two new luxury hotels in the
city have outraged conservationists, including President Vaclav Havel, who
has expressed his dismay at what many see as a threat to Prague's delicate
urban fabric.
The tourist boom has led inevitably to cases of over-charging and double
booking and in 1993 the post-revolutionary surge in numbers appeared to
level off. Hotel occupancy rates last year fell to 70 per cent, compared to
80 or 85 per cent in 1991 and 1992. The slump was partly a reflection of the
recession but also of exorbitant room prices at hotels that were little
better than two or three star establishments. Hoteliers appear to have
learned their lesson, and this year prices were pegged at 1993 levels,
resulting in a rise in bookings.
The CTA aims to convince visitors that there is more to the Czech Republic
than Prague. Many Czech towns are following the capital's lead in renovating
their ancient centres, and the country boasts hundreds of castles, many of
them in excellent repair.
The exquisite little town of Cesky Krumlov in southern Bohemia, for example,
was for years a secret known only to Austrian visitors. Now it is on most
tourist itineraries, helped by its designation by Unesco as a site of
special architectural importance.
The spa towns of Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad) and Marianske Lazne (Marienbad), in
western Bohemia close to the German border, were among Europe's most popular
resorts in the days when taking the waters was the aristocracy's favourite
pursuit. After falling on hard times during the communist era these quaint
little towns are trying to attract the new Czech elite and to wean
themselves off the German market on which they are heavily dependent.
Slovakia inherited most of Czechoslovakia's natural beauty when it split
from the Czech Republic two years ago. Nothing in the Czech Republic matches
the grandeur of the High Tatra mountains in eastern Slovakia. The Sumava
mountains in southern Bohemia are scenic and climbable, but their skiing
attractions do not live up to the Tatras or the Alps across the border in
Austria.
There is also a downside to the Czech tourist boom. Locals, especially in
Prague, complain that they can no longer afford to visit the centre of town,
where prices have risen in anticipation of high-spending foreigners. A
visitor is unlikely to meet an authentic native in the Old Town Square in
high summer, excepting those peddling souvenirs. Meanwhile the Prague of
bleak suburban high rises where the majority of the city's residents live is
definitely off the tourist map.
For many Czechs, however, weekends and holidays mean retreat to the family's
country house, which can be a palatial mansion or a little wooden hut in a
secluded spot by a river. Living in one of the world's great cities is fine,
but it means little unless one can escape from it every now and then.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (18): Brokers steal the
limelight - Vincent Boland's guide to doing business in the capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Those nostalgic for the Prague of dissident playwrights, banned books and
smoke-filled bars full of thirsty workers are in for a shock if they visit
the Czech capital before the end of March.
The government is selling a large slice of the local telephone monopoly to a
foreign investor, and the city is awash with merchant bankers and
telecommunications executives hogging the best restaurant tables and talking
telephone numbers into cellular phones.
The deal - which promises to be the biggest telecoms investment yet in
post-communist eastern Europe, is the high point of a process that has made
Prague a magnet for investors over the past five years.
This is a city where the stock market listings have replaced the Samizdat
publication as the hottest read in town; where the stockbroker and the
corporate lawyer are the people to see; and where a ticket to the opera
still costs next to nothing (if the best seats have not been block-booked by
a merchant banker entertaining visiting telecoms executives).
None of this is immediately apparent on arrival at Prague's Ruzyne airport.
The armed soldiers, glum faces and long queues at passport control suggest
nothing has changed, and the drive into the city in an outrageously
expensive taxi, past row after row of badly constructed panelaky (high-rise
housing) is a reminder that, no matter how much the Czechs might like to
forget it, this was recently a communist country.
Don't be put off. Once in town the atmosphere is transformed. Prague is full
of elegant streets, being brought back to life by new shops, cafes and coats
of paint.
The main hotels are scattered between the centre and the immediate suburbs,
with the Intercontinental, close to Old Town Square, and the Palace, just
off Wenceslas Square, being the most central. The Atrium and the Forum,
overlooking the main motorway through the city, are also close enough for a
quick trip into the centre.
For something a little more luxurious try the newly opened Grand Hotel
Bohemia in the heart of tourist Prague. One of the hotel's main attractions
for business guests is a fax in every room, courtesy of communist-era
telephone lines once used to bug visiting party officials.
The centre of Prague is dotted with bureaux de change, but to avoid
exorbitant commissions change money at the main banks. Banking hours are
usually from 8am to 5pm. The Czech National Bank is pushing to make the
currency, the koruna, fully convertible by 1995, and it has been stable for
the past three years. Current exchange rates are about Kc27.5 to Dollars 1,
Kc43.5 to Pounds 1.00 and Kc17.5 to DM1.00.
The telephone system can be trying (hence the need for new investment).
Dialling within the city is easy, but it is more difficult to get through to
other parts of the country. International calls are also straightforward but
expensive.
Czech time-keeping can be relaxed, but it is better to be on time for
business meetings and the working day begins as early as 7am, although
business meetings generally do not start until 9am. Bring a good supply of
business cards as most people have one, invariably listing the holder's
educational qualifications.
Although the business lunch is becoming more common, initial discussions are
usually held over coffee or juice in the office. Many Czechs are at least
bilingual and English is fast becoming the lingua franca among the Czech
Republic's business community.
After a day's deal-making it is well worth a look around town. The Golden
City, as Prague is known, is one of the most beautiful in the world, with
perfect examples of nearly every type of architecture through the ages, many
of which are being restored to their original splendour.
Czech food is an acquired taste, with an emphasis on pork, game and
calories. Try Au Saint Esprit, the Kampa Klub or V Zatisi for excellent fish
(with prices to match), or U modre kachnlcky (The Blue Duck) for good Czech
dishes. Local wine is cheaper than and just as good as many imported
vintages. The Prague Post or Prognosis, both English-language weeklies, give
listings for restaurants and entertainment.
The favourite Czech method of relaxation is over a glass of beer in a
pivnice (pub). Beer is plentiful and delicious and can cost as little as 25p
a half-litre in local bars where the emphasis is on serious drinking rather
than comfort.
Prague is an easy city to negotiate. Its network of metro, trams and buses
is well-integrated but often overcrowded, especially at rush-hour (7-8.30am
and 4-6pm). The metro is limited but fast and clean, while the trams can be
slow and smelly. Tickets cost Kc6, the fine for not having one Kc200. Beware
of taxis: the city's cab drivers are notorious for over-charging foreigners,
and can be rude and aggressive to those who argue over the size of the fare.
The city is generally safe to walk around at night, although petty crime is
rising. What comes as a shock, however, is the rudeness of store staff,
especially if you visit a tabak, for a newspaper or metro tickets. Remember
that you are only the customer, and therefore the least important person in
the store.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (15): Firmly embarked on new strategy -
Profile: Volvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Firing on all cylinders.' 'Up to speed again.' 'Back in top gear'. To the
relief - and pride - of most Swedes, the motoring metaphors have been
flowing thick and fast this year for Volvo, the country's biggest
manufacturer.
Thanks to a dramatic recovery in profits, memories of the ignominious
collapse at the end of 1993 of Volvo's plans to merge with France's Renault
have faded fast. Volvo returned a 12-fold growth in pre-tax profits in the
first nine months of the year to record a surplus of SKr12.7bn, on turnover
of SKr112.2bn.
Under the energetic Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who has emerged as
the new dominant figure in Volvo, the company is firmly embarked on a new
strategy to focus on its core vehicle-making operations. By the end of 1996,
it intends to have sold off all its non-core assets, raising a total of some
SKr40bn to finance the future development of cars and trucks.
Today, there is a widely-held view in the industry that Volvo Truck
Corporation is already in strong shape. At the nine-month stage, worldwide
unit truck sales were up 38 per cent at 49,400, delivering a jump in
operating profits to SKr2.7bn that produced an operating margin of seven per
cent.
The big question mark, however, hangs over the future of Volvo Cars, the
biggest division by sales value and the real heart of the company in the
eyes of a nation which has always regarded Volvo as Sweden's industrial
flagship.
The car corporation also produced a big improvement in the first nine
months: unit sales, at 269,600, were up 18 per cent; operating profits went
from near break-even to SKr1.95bn. But Mr Gyll was quick to admit that the
operating margin of 4 per cent, achieved as Volvo approaches the top of the
business cyle, fell far short of the 7 per cent average he says the car
division needs to achieve over a complete cycle.
Uncomfortably for Volvo, it is setting out to achieve this as a niche player
in the worldwide car industry at a time when the trend among its competitors
has been towards building volume.
Volvo is now one of the world's smallest producers of mainstream vehicles,
with a basic range of just three cars in the 900, 800 and 400 series. Many
in Sweden who argued against the merger with Renault said Volvo should set
out to become a 'Swedish BMW'. Within months of Volvo choosing that path,
however, the German carmaker itself opted to make a quantum leap in its
volume output by buying Britain's Rover.
Mr Gyll and Mr Per-Erik Mohlin, head of the car division, are well aware of
this background. But they argue that there are still opportunities for a
manufacturer of Volvo's size - Mr Mohlin says he is aiming for optimum
output of 500,000 cars a year - given its powerful brand name and the vital
ability of smaller manufacturers to use modern production techniques to be
more responsive to customer demand.
On the marketing front, Mr Mohlin intends to stretch Volvo's traditional
appeal to family car buyers - primarily through its famously roomy estate
cars - to what he calls 'pre-family' and 'post-family' buyers. The intention
is to build on Volvo's reputation for safety, reliability and environmental
friendliness to embrace at the same time greater 'driveability', with more
emphasis on performance. The implication of this for production is for
sportier models, with more attention to interior comforts. Volvo is not
about to abandon estate cars, but it will concentrate harder on producing
attractive saloons that get away from the 'boxy and boring' image of the
past - and give greater added sales value. The trail has already been blazed
to some extent by the successful 850 model; one in four 850s sold are the
turbo-engined version.
Volvo also has to decide whether to make a belated response to the inroads
made into the estate car market by four-wheel-drive vehicles and 'people
carriers'. Although no definite decision has been announced, all the
indications are that Volvo will not attempt any significant extension of its
basic production range.
Rather, Mr Mohlin says, Volvo will probably cut down from three basic
'platforms' - or chassis - to two; the 800 and the medium-small sized 400
series. The 400 series is produced in the Netherlands in a joint venture
with Japan's Mitsubishi. From these, Volvo will seek to produce a more
varied range of models.
'We know it is possible to develop more cars from a single platform. The
trick is to utilise common components, but to differentiate the products,'
Mr Mohlin says.
He says the aborted merger with Renault has cost Volvo more than a year in
its vital programme to develop new models. This has increased the pressure
to produce a successful formula that will carry Volvo over the next downturn
in the cycle and prove that it can thrive as an independent carmaker.
The headline writers will be no less ready with their cliches if it fails.
'Volvo stalls', 'Breakdown' and 'Running out of fuel' are the banners Mr
Gyll and Mr Mohlin are determined to avoid.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (17): Master of its own destiny - Profile:
Kalmar Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recent events at Kalmar Industries, based at Ljungby in southern Sweden,
provide a classic example of the changes that Swedish industry has undergone
as it grappled with recession and aimed to increase its productivity and
competitiveness.
The company is the world's largest producer of heavy lift trucks - the kind
that can pick up and stack huge laden shipping containers - and also makes
sideloaders and light- and medium-sized lift trucks (forklifts).
It has 500 workers at Ljungby and 250 at nearby Lidhult, where Sweden's
first lift trucks were developed at the end of the 1940s - with the help,
initially, of a local blacksmith. Its biggest Swedish competitor in heavy
lift-trucks, Svetruck, is also based in Ljungby.
Since 1990, restructuring has dominated the agenda at Kalmar. It has reduced
the worldwide workforce by 27 per cent to 1,150, with the bulk of the cuts
outside Sweden. Production of Irion sideloaders was moved last year from a
plant near Stuttgart to Sweden, involving the loss of 180 jobs in Germany.
In the UK, where Kalmar bought Coventry-Climax in 1987, production of the
Climax range of light trucks for the UK market was discontinued in 1992, and
is now outsourced to US and Japanese suppliers.
At home, emphasis has focused on boosting productivity. Absenteeism has been
sharply reduced, co-operation between unions and management has replaced
confrontation, teamwork and flexibility are the buzzwords.
Bringing manufacturing back to Sweden from Germany was thus a sign of
confidence in the ability to manufacture competitively at Ljungby - helped,
naturally, by the devaluation of the krona in late 1992. It also helped fill
spare capacity caused by the recession, which prompted a sharp fall in
demand in a number of important product and geographic markets. Worldwide
sales fell from SKr1.62bn in 1990 to SKr1.36bn in 1992, turning a profit of
SKr59m, after financial items, into a loss of SKr34m.
There was an improvement last year, especially on the heavier side of the
business, and sales of SKr1.6bn produced a profit of SKr34m after financial
items. So, in mid-January, when Mr Jonas Svantesson joined the company as
president and chief executive, he found it in good shape.
'A lot of restructuring had been done, and the workers' loyalty and ambition
was very strong,' he says. 'I thought that if everyone could be pointed in
the same direction, it had enormous potential.'
Just two months after Mr Svantesson arrived at Kalmar, he was told that its
then owner, Svedala, planned to dispose of the company.
In late spring, the lift truck producer was floated on the Stockholm Stock
Exchange, and now has some heavyweight UK institutions among its
shareholders.
The change in status is seen as a new beginning for Kalmar, which became
caught up in some of the big recent corporate deals in Sweden and was often
too small a part of its parent companies' business to be given much
priority.
Procordia, the former state-affiliated holding company, sold then
loss-making Kalmar to the engineering group Componenta in 1989, but
Componenta was itself purchased by Svedala two years later.
Mr Svantesson welcomes Kalmar's new freedom to make decisions as master of
its own destiny, without having to refer them to a parent company. Workers'
loyalty to the success of the company is now much greater, he says, and in
any case some of the expected synergies between Svedala and Kalmar had not
materialised.
The flotation has come against a backdrop of much better financial
performance, with profits of SKr110m after financial items for the first
nine months of the year, compared with just SKr10m a year earlier. Improved
profitability has spruced up the balance sheet, with net debt falling from
SKr275m at the end of last year to SKr67m.
The light and medium sized truck business has improved sharply, catching up
with the heavy side, but there is still room for further improvement.
For the future, Mr Svantesson's strategy for Kalmar is to keep it in
lift-trucks, seeking protection from some of the vagaries of the market by
building a balanced business rather than diversifying out of materials
handling.
First, he wants to build up the non-cyclical parts of the business. Already,
50 per cent of Kalmar's turnover relates to container handling, in ports and
terminals, which is non-cyclical. The forestry and steel sector markets
account for 40 per cent, but are very cyclical.
Mr Svantesson has important geographic targets too. North America accounts
for 5 per cent of sales, but he aims to grow that to 15 per cent. The
company is looking closely at how to expand in the three leading Latin
American markets of Brazil, Argentina and Chile, but the big growth prospect
is Asia, he says.
The region accounts for 13 per cent of sales, but this could grow to 20 per
cent, says Mr Svantesson. China's huge planned expansion of port capacity is
potentially good news for Kalmar's sales of container-handling lift trucks,
but other Asian countries also represent tempting prospects.
At present, Kalmar is happy to be manufacturing all its machinery in Sweden,
although production in Asia is not ruled out if demand warrants it.
With 90 per cent of its sales outside Sweden, the krona's devaluation has
helped sales of light and medium-sized trucks, where competitors typically
produce in countries with strong currencies such as Japan and Germany. In
contrast, Kalmar's competitors on the heavy side are mainly from nations
with weak currencies such as Finland, Italy or Sweden itself.
Along with many Swedish businessmen, though, Mr Svantesson is in favour of a
stronger krona - which would be a sign that the government is grappling with
the budget deficit. Also, he notes, 55-60 per cent of the production value
of Kalmar's lift trucks products is bought in from suppliers, and half of
that comes from abroad.
If the krona does rise, Kalmar will have to continue raising productivity to
remain competitive in overseas markets. Mr Svantesson makes clear that the
company will not be resting on its laurels: further efficiency gains can be
made at the Swedish plants through improved production flows and other
changes - without huge investments, he says.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (16): Big productivity increase -
Manufacturing industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Management and employees in Swedish manufacturing industry deserve much of
the credit for a transformation in the country's industrial competitiveness
since the early 1990s, but their own efforts and government policy will
dictate whether further progress can be made.
Two important factors have transformed the competitiveness of Swedish
industry, according to Mr Magnus Lemmel, director-general of the Federation
of Swedish Industries. The first is the Swedish krona's de facto devaluation
of 25 per cent in the past two years, which has restored manufacturers'
ability to compete in the European market.
The second change, says Mr Lemmel, is a big increase in industry's
productivity over the past few years. In the long term, this is more
important, he says. The krona may rise in value, but the effects of
increased productivity will endure.
The increase in productivity has come through a mixture of government and
industry efforts. Cuts in sick-leave benefits made by the former, pre-1991
Social Democratic government had a very important effect, reducing
absenteeism by about 20 per cent.
Since then, the recession across much of Sweden's industrial sector -
whether export-oriented or reliant on the domestic market - has led to big
reductions in employment. 'We are now producing more, with much less
labour,' says Mr Lemmel.
Prompted partly by the downturn, important internal improvements in
manufacturing have come, with better management, logistics, and flow of
goods, all designed to raise productivity. Labour-management relations are
much improved, and discussions are conducted in a good atmosphere, he says.
Mr Lemmel might be expected to promote Swedish industry's achievements but
his views are corroborated by observers of the Swedish industrial scene.
Mr John McDowall, a British Steel executive director, has been making
monthly trips to Sweden in the past year as chairman of Avesta Sheffield,
the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer. He says he is very encouraged by
the company's productivity improvements and the positive attitude of workers
and trade unions.
Mr Lemmel is now looking to Sweden's new minority Social Democratic
government to 'do the right things' to ensure that the business climate
remains favourable. A crucial factor, he says, will be the extent to which
reductions in the budget deficit are achieved through spending cuts rather
than increased taxes, and 'judgment day' will be January's budget.
'So far, the emphasis has been on raising taxes, but the balance needs to be
changed,' he says. Increased taxes on employment, for example, would hamper
industry's ability to grow.
The recent retrenchment and reorganisation in Swedish industry, and the
current attitude of multinational companies to manufacturing there, is well
illustrated by the experiences of two companies with deep Swedish roots, but
whose global headquarters are abroad.
Asea Brown Boveri, Europe's largest electrical engineering group, employs
about 27,000 people in Sweden, a reduction of about 3,000 since 1990-91. The
reductions, it says, took place mainly in those businesses affected by the
domestic recession, notably in the construction market.
As a manufacturing base, it says, Sweden's situation is now very favourable.
'We have a cost base that makes us very competitive in the international
market, not least thanks to the krona situation.'
But it stresses that the weak krona is only part of the story. A special
export campaign, and Swedish ABB's much-admired T50 customer focus
programme, presided over by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, its chief executive, have
laid the internal foundation for success.
As an example of what the process has achieved, it cites ABB Stal in
Finspong, which in 1990 supplied six gas turbines worth about SKr500m. Next
year's target is deliveries worth SKr2bn, equivalent to 25 gas turbines,
with a workforce that has increased by only 15 per cent.
ABB Sweden echoes Mr Lemmel by calling for the public finances to be put on
a sound basis, and warning of the vital importance that the continuing
positive development of industry is not hindered in any way.
Meanwhile VME Group, the Brussels-based producer of construction equipment,
has reduced its Swedish workforce from about 6,500 in 1989 to 4,400, and
closed three plants, at Landskrona, Lund and Karlskrona (the last two came
with the acquisition in 1991 of Akermans, the hydraulic excavator producer).
The closures were part of a worldwide reorganisation in response to the
recession, says Mr Tuve Johannesson, president and chief executive. They
were accompanied by significant restructuring of the factories that
remained, to increase productivity and shorten lead times.
With a reduced manufacturing base, the recent upturn in sales has lead to a
dramatic improvement in profitability, in the form of a Dollars 200m
turnround out of the red over the past two years.
Mr Johannesson says that Swedish industry was 'completely lacking in
realism' in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and 'only started to sober up
during the recession.' Now, he says, there is good reason to be
'fundamentally positive' about Sweden as a country in which to invest and
manufacture.
He too, though, is worried by the new government's attitudes to business
taxation, and the possibility of increased income tax.
Another concern, says Mr Johannesson, is the possibility of renewed
'imported inflation' because of raw material shortages and the present weak
currency. Increased inflation would automatically stimulate a renewed debate
on wages, and a return to bad habits.
Any rise in the krona over the next few years - as a result, perhaps, of
tough action to control the budget deficit - would reduce the cost of
industry's imported raw materials. That would partially offset the reduced
benefits for exporters, which in turn would encourage manufacturers to
continue raising their productivity.
The bright outlook for manufacturing, notwithstanding the concerns about
government policy, has been enhanced by last month's referendum on Sweden
joining the European Union.
Large international companies such as ABB and VME say the positive result
has removed a risk that would have had to be assessed when making a
long-term investment decision. Slowly, investments in Sweden would have
declined in favour of EU countries.
In terms of business opportunities, though, the real beneficiaries are
likely to be Sweden's smaller engineering sub-contractors, says Mr Thomas
Older, president and chief executive of Svedala Industri, the big mineral
processing and construction equipment group.
'It would have been very easy for us to have slowly moved more manufacturing
into other countries,' he says. 'Our sub-suppliers at home would have been
the ones to suffer.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (16): Modest planning prevails
 -Kevin Done follows the progress of VW's investment in Skoda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech government has been given a bumpy ride by Volkswagen, since it
chose the German carmaker four years ago to take control of Skoda, the Czech
car producer.
In the euphoria that surrounded VW's ambitious forays into eastern Europe,
the group made lavish promises about the scale of the future investment
planned for Skoda.
In early 1991 VW said that it planned capital investments totalling DM9.5bn
for Skoda by the end of the decade. It would more than double Skoda's
production capacity to about 390,000 cars a year and it would build a new
engine plant.
Subsequent events have been a sobering experience both for VW and for the
authorities in Prague.
The original contract agreed in 1991, which gave VW an initial 31 per cent
stake and management control, has been under renegotiation for the past 15
months following Volkswagen's withdrawal without warning in the autumn of
1993 from a prestige DM1.4bn project finance facility for Skoda.
Since the signing of the original contract conditions have changed
drastically at VW itself and in the European car market, and the company
accepts that its initial planning was hugely over-optimistic.
'There was the thinking that the future could only be bright and clear,'
admits Mr Volkhard Kohler, Skoda vice-chairman. 'But today we can see there
are risks . . . When the iron curtain came down there were ideas that you
could speed up development, but today it is clear that that cannot happen,'
he says.
Volkswagen itself was also overcome by the recession in west Europe. It
plunged into record losses of DM1.94bn in 1993.
The robust regime initiated by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the controversial
chairman of the VW group management board who was appointed at the beginning
of 1993, set out to cut costs to the bone, and the Skoda project has been
subjected to the same relentless review as the rest of the group's
operations, with little regard to the sensitivities of VW's partners.
But late last month VW and the Czech government initialled a new agreement
giving Prague backing for a revised development plan for Skoda and including
a commitment from VW to the further development of the Czech automotive
components industry.
Under the terms of the deal VW has won approval for a more modest capacity
expansion, and it has dropped the plan for a new engine plant. The current
capital spending plan totals about DM3.7bn from 1991 to 2000, but this
amount can be reduced further if VW can find additional investment cost
savings.
Volkswagen has agreed to raise Skoda production capacity to 340,000 a year
by the late 1990s from about 230,000 at present. Its plans include:
A second car range for Skoda, due to be launched in 1996-97. This large
family car range will have a unique Skoda body and interior, but will be
part of the VW group's ambitious strategy to rationalise its product
development and engineering operations. It will derive from the VW's
so-called 'A' platform, which will also form the basis for the next
generation VW Golf. Building a new paint plant at Skoda's main production
facility at Mlada Boleslav.
Building a new assembly plant for the second car range.
Development of Skoda's existing all-aluminium 1.3 litre engine for use in
both its planned car ranges and for possible use by Seat, the VW group's
Spanish subsidiary.
The addition next year of estate car and pick-up versions of the new Skoda
Felicia small family car range - unveiled in October as the replacement for
the outdated Favorit.
Continued reduction of the size of the Skoda workforce as productivity is
raised. It will fall to under 16,000 in 1995 from more than 17,000 last
year, and could be reduced by a further 3-4,000 over the next five years.
As part of the new agreement VW has secured full title to the use of the
Skoda brand name - previously disputed by Skoda Pilzen, the Czech
engineering group - and has resolved all property title disputes over the
Skoda plants.
The deal opens the way for Volkswagen to raise its 31 per cent holding to
60.3 per cent by the end of December - including the conversion of
preference stock into ordinary voting shares - and to 70 per cent by the end
of 1995.
In total, VW will have paid in three tranches DM1.4bn for the 70 per cent
stake - DM200m to the Czech government for the acquisition of part of its
holding and DM1.2bn in new equity capital for Skoda.
The development of a more efficient Czech component industry was a key
element in the original VW acquisition of Skoda, and its renewed commitment
to this programme will be part of the new agreement with the government.
According to Mr Kohler 'a velvet revolution' is under way in the Czech
supply industry. Since VW moved into Skoda nearly four years ago about 40
joint venture components operations have been established, which already
supply 44 per cent of Skoda's purchases of materials. A further 6.5 per cent
of purchases come from greenfield site operations.
About 80 per cent of Skoda's total purchases of CKr21bn a year are made in
the Czech Republic and Slovakia and more than half of total purchases are
already coming from suppliers with access to western technology.
VW is now seeking to break new ground at Skoda by establishing supplier
operations directly inside the car plant, moving a step head even of the
Japanese model of having suppliers grouped in close proximity to the plant.
Three suppliers - Lucas, Johnson Controls and Pelzer - already work inside
the Skoda plant, producing respectively rear axles, seats and carpets.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (14): Where obscurity seems
bearable - The people of Moravia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The people of Moravia, who inhabit the eastern part of the ancient lands of
the Czech crown, share some of the frustrations long felt by the Slovaks
when they formed the tail of the now defunct federal country called the
Czech and Slovak republic.
There was no hint in the old name that Moravians also lived in
Czechoslovakia, and there is still no hint of their presence in the name of
the Czech Republic. They appear resigned to being overlooked. Following a
brief, half-hearted flirtation with separatism after 1989, when new states
were cropping up all over eastern Europe, Moravians seem to have accepted
the inevitability of living in Bohemia's shadow within the Czech Republic.
The movement that kept alive the idea of Moravian separatism splintered into
four factions after the demise of the federation two years ago, when Prague
stamped out any lingering hopes that Moravia would follow Slovakia into
independence. As the Czech Republic's most heavily industrialised region,
contributing more to the national gross domestic product than larger and
more populated Bohemia, Moravia's independence was anathema to the
government.
Yet Moravians quietly insist on their separate identity. Mr Jaroslav Kupka,
vice-president of the Czech-Moravian Centre party, which wants 'to renew the
historical autonomy of Moravia within the framework of the Czech Republic,'
cites a 1991 poll which he says showed that most Moravians identify first
with their province and second with the state.
His party is pushing for the creation of a regionalised state with elected
administrations having cultural and educational autonomy and a budget,
financed either by subsidy or through local taxes, to pay for it.
Mr Klaus, who is a strong opponent of what he calls the 'cantonisation' of
the unitary Czech state, is suspicious of any form of local government
organisation that would raise the spending power and political autonomy of
local authorities and regions. The only concessions to federalism by Prague
so far have been the siting of the Constitutional Court and the
anti-monopoly ministry in Brno.
Faced with such an uncompromising line, Moravians are keeping their heads
down, and the attachment to their province's historical legacy now appears
to be mainly sentimental. In local elections in November Moravians voted
overwhelmingly for national parties.
In the city of Brno, the province's capital and the country's second city,
candidates representing the Civic Democratic party (ODS) of Mr Klaus swept
into City Hall, routing the four successor parties to the Moravian
separatist movement, whose combined seats fell from 20 to just five. The
city's new mayor, Ms Dagmar Lastovecka, is a member of ODS, and many of the
city's leading business people are supporters of Mr Klaus.
Only half the population of southern Moravia is truly Moravian, with
Bohemians a close second. 'We are not a nation,' Mr Kupka admits. 'Our
demands for autonomy are not based on nationalism, but on history.'
So Moravia soldiers on in relative obscurity. Asked to name 10 famous
Moravians, Mr Kupka is momentarily stumped for an answer. After offering
Charles the Elder, an ancient monarch, he eventually comes up with the
composer Leos Janacek, Tomas G Masaryk, founder and first president of the
interwar state of Czechoslovakia, and the philosopher Jan Komenius. The list
may be small, but it is impressive.
A little reluctantly, Mr Kupka ventures the name of the emigre writer Milan
Kundera, a Brno native whose penetrating and often deeply funny analysis of
Soviet-imposed 'normalisation' in Czechoslovakia after the 1968 Prague
spring, and musings on the 'unbearable lightness of being', have made him a
cult figure in the west.
In the west, of course, Kundera is considered a Czech (and possibly a
bohemian with a small 'b'), not a Moravian.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (15): Trading post has big
ideas - Brno, the country's second city, aims to become a centre for
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any city that lives in the shadow of Prague can count on being ignored most
of the time. This gives an edge to Brno's attempts to become a business
centre in its own right.
For British veterans of the second world war, the city is perhaps best known
as the home of the Bren gun. This fast and accurate machine gun was just one
of the first-class light armaments for which the Moravian capital is famous.
The desire to seize control of the region's arms industry was one of the
reasons behind Hitler's decision to annex Bohemia and Moravia in 1938.
The arms industry is now a shadow of its former self, although rebuilding a
slimmed-down and modernised arms industry is again considered politically
respectable. President Vaclav Havel's high-minded talk of getting rid of the
Czechoslovak arms industry after the Velvet Revolution got short shrift in
Moravia and Slovakia, where the industry employs thousands.
Many of the best-known names in Czech industry are located in Brno,
including Zetor, the tractor maker which is currently going through a
painful restructuring process. With its long tradition of engineering skills
and its endless industrial suburbs, the city is the Czech Republic's leading
centre for transportation and agricultural machinery production. Some
two-thirds of Brno's workforce is employed in the engineering, optics and
glass industries.
The skills base has attracted significant foreign investment, which is
helping old capital-starved industries to restructure and modernise. ABB,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, has invested heavily in Brno in the
past three years, and now employs nearly 6,000 people at engineering and
electronics plants in the city.
About a sixth of Brno's 390,000 inhabitants are students at its six
universities which means a big supply of skilled labour for regional
industries, which also include mining, energy and metallurgy.
Internationally, Brno is probably best known as central Europe's largest
trade fair centre. The city has been a trading post for centuries, and this
year alone more than 1m visitors have attended dozens of fairs at the
750,000sq metre BVV exhibition grounds on the outskirts. The fairs draw
exhibitors from around the world, with a greater number coming from the west
since the collapse of communism destroyed the Comecon trading bloc.
Mr Bretislav Fabian, sales director at BVV, says the Brno exhibitions 'are
as important for central Europe as Frankfurt is for the west'. The highlight
is a giant engineering fair every September, which this year drew more than
3,200 exhibitors from 35 countries.
The city authorities have ambitious plans for reviving derelict areas of the
city centre, including the construction of a huge shopping and office
complex that will mean moving the city's main railway terminus.
A joint venture between the city, the technical university and the UK
construction company Bovis, part of the P&amp;O group, is building a Czech
Technology Park on a 120-hectare site on the city's outskirts. Providing
high-tech office space for new industries, it will capitalise on established
academic-corporate links.
The park has already secured Siemens Telecommunications as its first
big-name client, according to Mr James Hoddell of Healey &amp; Baker, which is
marketing the development but the entire Dollars 200m development is not
expected to be finished for at least a decade.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (14): A remarkable comeback - Profile:
Stena Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a company that was in crisis and making heavy losses only three years
ago, Stena Line, the world's biggest ferry operator, has staged a remarkable
comeback. Despite difficult market conditions in both its Scandinavian and
UK markets, it is heading for a record SKr500m profit in 1994 and it is once
again planning significant fleet investments.
The severe difficulties experienced earlier in the decade were caused by the
company's Dollars 570m purchase of Sealink, Britain's second-biggest ferry
operator, in 1990. The move left it with huge debt-servicing costs and a
need to undertake important restructuring in the newly-acquired operation.
The Gothenburg-based company even threatened to close Sealink entirely,
barely 18 months after the purchase in a move to force unions to accept
drastic cost-cutting.
If Stena ever shared the widespread view that it had overreached itself,
these days it has no such doubts. Mr Bo Lerenius, Stena Line president,
says: 'It was a bold move, but strategically it was definitely the right
one.' What has changed is not just the outlook for Stena Sealink, but the
broader financial recovery which the whole group has staged over the past
three years.
It got out of its crisis by hacking back costs, launching a hefty rights
issue and convertible loan, and reigning in investments. Together with
rising profits and increasing cash flow, the group has been able to pay a
substantial part of its debt. It is now confident of getting its
equity-to-assets ratio back to the pre-Sealink purchase level of 30 per cent
by early next year.
Stena today carries more than 14m passengers a year on 15 routes in 32
vessels. The irony is that the UK routes have ended up supporting the group
at a time when its Scandinavian business has suffered from recession and the
weak Swedish krona. Passenger numbers on UK routes climbed 10 per cent in
the first eight months of this year, while Scandinavian routes saw a 1.4 per
cent decrease.
Conditions in both markets have been difficult. In the UK there has been a
price war in the run-up to the full start-up of the Channel Tunnel. In
Scandinavia, consumer spending has fallen and there has been a sharp fall in
travel on some routes in the wake of the Estonia tragedy.
Given that Stena has some 34 per cent of the British passenger shipping
market - second only to P&amp;O - it cannot afford to be complacent about the
Channel Tunnel. Its main UK route, Dover-Calais, will be competing head-on
with tunnel traffic.
Stena is sceptical about Eurotunnel's assumptions that it will eventually
gain some 30 per cent of freight traffic and 50 per cent of cars on
short-sea cross-channel routes, but it is basing its strategy on them
nevertheless.
One solution would be for it to seek an extensive collaboration with P&amp;O,
although this would have to meet with the approval of the relevant
competition authorities. In any case, it expects the overall market to grow,
helped by economic growth in both Britain and France.
Nordic ferry traffic has been hit hard by the sinking of the ferry Estonia,
which capsized in heavy seas in September with the loss of more than 900
lives. Stena has suffered less than other shipping groups, partly because it
does not operate in the Baltic Sea where the tragedy occurred. The company's
passenger volumes in the Swedish and Norwegian markets fell by 12-14 per
cent during October and November, although there are now signs of recovery.
Stena, like other ferry operators, is bracing itself for some tough new
safety regulations in the wake of the tragedy. Although these will add to
costs, it believes the impact will be neutral in competitive terms because
rivals will have to implement the same measures.
The secret weapon in Stena's armoury is undoubtedly its revolutionary HSS
Highspeed Sea Service project, which it has developed with its main owner,
Stena AB. Three fast ferries, which will halve normal travel times, have
been ordered from a Finnish yard and a fourth is planned. 'We are quite
convinced that this will change ferry traffic a great deal,' says Mr
Lerenius. However, some observers regard the project as technically risky,
and at a total estimated cost of SKr3bn, it is certainly an ambitious
investment.
It is the first time that high-speed ferries will be able to carry lorries,
trailers and buses alongside passengers and cars. The boast is that they
will offer a degree of comfort and reliability which present fast vessels,
such as catamarans, can not. The first of the Finnish-built vessels, which
will each be able to carry 1,500 passengers, is due to enter service across
the Irish Sea next September.
A lot is riding on the success of the ships, not least because they are an
element in the group's overall strategy of enhancing the transport-derived
portion of its revenues. The aim is to gradually reduce the company's
dependence on duty-free sales which are due to be phased out under European
Union rules in 1999.
Already Stena has reduced the proportion of on-board income (including
duty-free) as a percentage of total operating income from 55 per cent in
1988 to less than 35 per cent today.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (13): Profits have surged - Profile:
Saab-Scania
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saab-Scania, the Swedish vehicle and aerospace group, is at last starting to
produce the sort of returns that its owners, the Wallenbergs, must have
hoped for when they bought the group in 1991, reports Christopher
Brown-Humes.
Profits have surged this year, after two dismal years in 1992 and 1993,
driving the broader recovery of Investor, the key Wallenberg holding company
which wholly owns the group. In the first nine months, Saab-Scania achieved
an operating income of SKr2.3bn, a spectacular increase from only SKr108m in
the same 1993 period.
Spectacular, perhaps, but a performance nevertheless which mixes 'wine with
water,' according to Mr Lars Kylberg, Saab-Scania chief executive.
The 'wine' is Scania, the world's fifth-largest truck group, which has
benefited from a strong revival in demand and soaring sales.
The 'water' is the group's commercial airline business which has suffered
heavy losses amid plunging sales and orders.
The commercial aircraft division is, undoubtedly, the group's immediate
headache because this year it is only likely to sell 15 of its turbo-prop
aircraft, against the 50 which it needs to sell to break even.
The group produces two airliners, the Saab 340, which can seat 20-39
passengers, and the Saab 2000, a newer model seating 40-59 passengers.
General market overcapacity has caused problems not just for Saab-Scania,
but for many of its competitors. Indeed, it is this general state of
distress that leads Mr Kylberg to believe that a far-reaching solution -
nothing short of an European Airbus-type consortium in turbo-props - might
be possible. 'If I had a single New Year wish, this is what I would really
like to happen in 1995,' he says.
The members of Mr Kylberg's mini-Airbus consortium would be Saab-Scania,
British Aerospace, ATR, the French-Italian group, and Germany's Deutsche
Aerospace. Forging a collaboration would provide Europe with real clout in
its battle with overseas competitors such as Canada's Bombadier and Brazil's
Embraer, he argues.
But there is a long way to go and even if agreement can be reached between
the four parties, the European competition authorities may not like it. If
the venture fails, Mr Kylberg maintains that Saab-Scania can still soldier
on on its own, although it is not a prospect which he relishes.
Apart from anything else, he feels the group is at a competitive
disadvantage because it cannot offer some of the export credits and other
soft financing mechanisms that its rivals can.
Saab-Scania is also seeking to build a strong international alliance for its
fighter aircraft, the JAS 39 Gripen. The project has been hit by delays and
cost-overruns, and last year suffered the trauma of a high-profile crash
during a Stockholm air display.
The group has a healthy order book from the Swedish air force for the
aircraft, a multi-purpose reconnaissance and attack fighter, but full
commercial success will only come with export orders. That is why
Saab-Scania wants an overseas partner.
The company in question is almost certain to be British Aerospace. The two
companies have talked for more than a year and a final agreement in the form
of a sales and marketing joint venture is likely to be announced during the
spring.
BAe has a strong historic position in a number of the markets which
Saab-Scania would like to penetrate, including Middle Eastern and Far
Eastern countries.
The British group's help in producing an 'export' version of the aircraft,
which could be adapted to local conditions, is also being sought.
Saab-Scania is definitely not seeking a partner for its Scania bus and truck
division, which has consistently proved to be one of the world's most
profitable operations in this field. Scania has a number of basic strengths,
including modular construction (using the same core module for different
truck models) and a strong dealer organisation.
In the past year these advantages have been enhanced by the weakness of the
krona and recovering demand and the group has been able to take market
share. European production has doubled to 140 trucks a day from 70.
Underscoring the upturn, Scania's sales surged 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn in
the first nine months while its order intake jumped 61 per cent to 29,100
trucks and buses. The unit's operating margin reached 14 per cent, about
twice the level of Volvo Trucks, a highly-regarded competitor.
Scania's achievements are the more remarkable for the fact that it has not
produced a completely new model for many years, contenting itself instead
with a gradual refinement of existing models. Mr Kylberg declines to discuss
industry rumours suggesting a new model may come as early as next year.
Scania's present production and sales strongholds are Europe and Latin
America. It has consistently shied away from the North American market,
saying its sixth manufacturing plant - it has three in Europe and two in
Latin America - is likely to be in Asia. 'We see Asia as our third region,'
says Mr Kylberg.
Saab-Scania retains a 50 per cent stake in Saab Automobile. This is
essentially a financial investment because management is carried out by the
other joint owner, General Motors.
There have been rumours that Saab-Scania will sell out, but Mr Kylberg
denies it. 'We have a good co-operation with GM and wish it to stay like
that,' he says.
Besides, the group is at last earning money from Saab, which will make its
first profit for six years in 1994.
Mr Kylberg does not believe the group is spreading itself too thinly by
operating in so many sectors with huge capital requirements. He says
vehicle-making is the group's traditional business - Scania is 100 years old
and Saab is more than 50 - and that is where its expertise lies. In other
words, he is happy with the basic structure of the group.
The only difference is that by the year 2000 he hopes to have several strong
international partnerships in place to share some of the burdens.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (13): Bridgehead for ABB - A
power engineering success story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic has represented a special opportunity in central Europe
for ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering group.
For one thing, the country is likely to be a big market for the Zurich-based
group's products. Programmes to renovate power generation and distribution
infrastructure have high priority in the Czech Republic. For another, the
very strong tradition of engineering skills in the country offers ABB a
fresh pool of talent to add to its global network.
'There is a strong urge among the people, especially in Bohemia, to get back
their industrial strength,' says Mr Erik Fougner, ABB's country manager in
the Czech Republic.
ABB's advance into the republic began in 1990, and the group has been an
active participant in the privatisation process. To date, it has established
six operating subsidiaries mainly based on existing Czech companies, some of
them in joint ventures.
The most important of these is ABB Prvni brnenska strojirna Brno (ABB PRS),
based on the First Brno Engineering Works, a power engineering company
dating from early in the 19th century.
ABB and PRS established their joint venture in April 1993, taking the core
of PRS's boiler, turbine and power plant operations and 3,800 employees. ABB
has a two-thirds stake.
Last year, ABB also acquired EJF, a Brno-based maker of switchgear for all
voltage levels. Its other Czech subsidiaries include ABB Energo, a supplier
of power transmission and network control systems, ABB Lummus Chemoproject,
which supplies engineering services and ABB Elektro-Praga, a producer of
household electrical fittings. In addition, a division was set up in 1991 to
sell ABB's process instrumentation, robots and AC and DC drives.
Altogether, the group employs just under 7,000 people in the Czech Republic
and operates 13 factories. No business figures have been published, but Mr
Fougner says new orders totalled approximately Dollars 220m in the first
half of this year, as much as in the whole of last year.
Except for Elektro-Praga, all of the group's activity is directed at the
large-scale power generation and distribution market. It has not attempted
to bring its railway locomotive business to the republic.
Mr Fougner points out that strict new anti-pollution laws come into force in
the Czech republic in 1998, so the potential for contracts to clean up or
renovate existing power plants is considerable.
The group has just won an order to install its new pressurised fluidised bed
combustion (PFBC) system to renovate a coal-fired plant at Trebovice, and Mr
Fougner hopes for many more such contracts.
The group's Czech companies are also very quickly winning themselves roles
within the overall ABB organisation. Mr Fougner says that exports from the
Czech Republic now amount to about a quarter of turnover with imports at
about the same level. He expects exports to rise to 40 or 50 per cent of
turnover and for the Czech companies to become net exporters.
ABB has transferred technology in several areas - boilers, turbines, coal
combustion, medium voltage switchgear, engineering tools and household
fittings - to its Czech companies. PRS has been designated the group's
single European supplier of waste heat boilers.
The priority now is on bringing the companies' performance up to western
standards, in terms of productivity and quality. 'We are getting very close,
although the mix of capital and labour is not the same as in the west,' Mr
Fougner says. All the companies are in various stages of earning their ISO
9001 certification, and all but one are expected to have it by the end of
next year.
ABB's Czech companies have not been too badly hurt by the separation of
Slovakia. Most of the operations were on the Czech side. ABB's Czech offices
are no longer responsible for Slovakia, although that country remains an
important market for many of the Czech companies' products.
Relations with ABB subsidiaries in other central and eastern European
countries are at a formative stage. Poland is the only other country with a
substantial ABB presence, with Russia coming up quickly.
Other large Swiss companies have ventured into the Czech republic in the
past few years.
The foods group Nestle was a pioneer, joining forces with BSN, the leading
French food group, in 1992 to take over the country's biggest food producer,
Cokoladovny, with 8,000 employees in 15 plants across both the Czech
Republic and Slovakia.
There was speculation at the time that Cokoladovny would be split up in a
few years, with Nestle taking the confectionery business and BSN the
biscuits. This has not yet happened, and Nestle indicates the existing
arrangement is still working well.
Holderbank, the Swiss-based cement group, is one of five leading western
European cement makers that have invested heavily in the Czech Republic in
recent years, partly to prevent exports from the country upsetting western
European markets.
Ceva Prachovice, the Holderbank subsidiary, suffered a 12.5 per cent decline
in volume sales of cement last year to 1.06m tonnes, and market conditions
continue to be difficult. Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, said last month
that operations in eastern Europe were making only 'a very modest'
contribution to profit.
A more unexpected source of large Swiss activity in the Czech Republic is
the publishing industry. Ringier, one of Switzerland's biggest publishers,
produces Blesk, a highly successful saucy tabloid newspaper in the republic
as well as Profit, a popular business newspaper and some 20 other titles.
Mr Jurg Marquard, another Swiss publisher who has expanded in eastern
Europe, publishes Czech versions of the pop culture magazine, Popcorn and
Divka (Girl).

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (12): A blot on the conscience
 -Czech attitudes on citizenship for gypsies come under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM GROSS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The gypsies are vermin. We should put them on trains and move them out.
People here prefer the skinheads, ask anyone.'
This was how a news vendor reacted in the picturesque town of Pisck in South
Bohemia earlier this month when 14 skinheads were acquitted over charges
arising from the death of a 17-year-old Romany (gypsy) boy. He was
expressing a widely-held view which reflects badly on the Czech reputation
for tolerance.
The Czech Republic enjoys a good press as a model of how a post-communist
state should be run. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, has shown himself
to be a hard-headed and sophisticated leader, fully alert to the country's
economic needs. President Vaclav Havel enjoys a worldwide reputation as a
champion of liberal values. The country's image shines in a region beset by
communist comebacks and re-awakened ethnic conflicts.
However, treatment of the Romanies, the republic's only sizeable ethnic
minority, not just by skinheads, but by the government itself, is a source
of growing disquiet. An American diplomat told an international conference
in Warsaw in September that Czech policies over citizenship were creating 'a
humanitarian crisis in the heart of Europe'.
Since July this year, some 100,000 Romanies have been stripped of their
Czech citizenship. A new law, enacted after the split with Slovakia in 1993,
classifies almost all the country's Romany population, estimated at over
250,000, as Slovaks, although two-thirds were born on Czech territory, and
the rest were moved from Slovakia by the communists, usually forcibly, after
the war. They were mainly employed as manual labour in an area depopulated
by the post-war expulsion of Sudeten Germans.
To qualify for Czech citizenship, those now classified as Slovaks had to
meet several difficult conditions, including proof of registered residency
and a clean criminal record. Many failed as they had to overcome a
bewildering mass of bureaucratic hurdles and thousands are illiterate.
Although the vast majority of Czechoslovak Romanies gave up their nomadic
lifestyle about 350 years ago, they have continued to live on the margins of
society. Unable to form an effective political lobby and with few powerful
friends, they have made easy targets.
Ms Ina Zoon, of the Tolerance Foundation, a Czech human rights group, argues
that the citizenship law 'was designed in a discriminatory way and directed
against the Romany people'.
Many Czechs view Romanies as troublemakers and criminals, heavily involved
in prostitution and other unsavoury professions. But others say it is unfair
and ironic for Romanies to be singled out for their supposed criminal
behaviour, when Czech society as a whole is plagued by corruption scandals,
and cheating and petty theft are widespread.
However, Romany pickpocketing gangs and pimps tend to be visible. Crime
committed by non-Romanies may be more sophisticated and the police are often
less vigorous in their pursuit of it.
Since July, Romanies without Czech citizenship have been deprived of some
key rights, including the right to vote in last month's local elections.
They have also started to see their social benefits withdrawn.
Not only Czechs, but the international community at large has traditionally
shown a lack of concern about the estimated 6m Romanies who now comprise the
largest stateless minority in Europe. They are a distinct people who have
preserved their own language and culture since migrating to Europe from
India in the 10th century. But they are often seen in terms of crude
stereotypes - as thieving vagrants, fortune-tellers or picturesque figures
out of Bizet's Carmen.
Recently, however, a number of international organisations have begun to
take note of their plight and Czech citizenship policies are under fire. In
October members of the US Congress wrote to Mr Klaus urging him to secure a
change in the citizenship law, which they described as 'the most extensive
revocation of citizenship since the end of the second world war'. Mr Max van
der Stoel, the CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, also 'strongly
urged that such legislation be changed'.
A great cultural divide exists between Czechs and Romanies. The latter are
stuck at the bottom of the social ladder, but so far the government has
brushed aside criticism. Mr Klaus described the congressional letter as
'insignificant. Tens, if not hundreds, of letters come to my desk everyday,'
he declared. Even President Havel has publicly defended the law. Jiri Payne,
head of the Czech Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, says: 'Critics of
the law don't understand exactly how it is in our country.'
For Mr Klaus, the primary motivation behind the law may be a wish to remove
what he perceives as an economic drain and an obstacle on the headlong path
to prosperity. But there are also political advantages to be gained by
pandering to the widespread and often crudely-stated racism of much of the
electorate.
Opinion polls indicate around 75 per cent of Czechs dislike Romanies and 30
per cent believe they should be deported or isolated in ghettos. It is not
uncommon for bars and restaurants to display the sign: 'No Romanies served'.
Recently, even public swimming pools have started to ban them.
Where the government and its critics differ is about what should be done.
Romany groups now fear the Czech government may try to deport them. Although
the government denies this, economic hardships and racism may force many
Romanies to try to move to Slovakia, where the Czechs claim they will not
have trouble getting passports and citizenship rights.
It seems unlikely, however, that the new Slovak government, which includes
anti-Hungarian and anti-minority nationalists, will show much enthusiasm
about absorbing them. The danger here is that any border tug-of-war that
results could well inflame latent Czech-Slovak tensions as well as harming
the image of both countries.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (10): EU vote was critical - The forestry
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<TEXT>
No other Swedish industry had more at stake in the country's European Union
referendum than the forestry sector. Even people not directly involved in
the industry - the country's biggest net export earner - agreed that
Sweden's pulp and paper companies had much to lose if the country had stayed
outside.
'For the forestry industry a 'No' would have a catastrophe,' says Mr Arne
Martensson, chief executive of Svenska Handelsbanken.
The EU is the Swedish forest industry's biggest market by far. About 30 per
cent of its existing capacity is located outside Sweden within EU borders.
But the EU is also an important market for many of the country's other
multinationals, so it is not simply a question of access.
What distinguishes the forestry sector is the continuing environmental
debate, covering everything from recycling and waste management to
clear-cutting (the practice of completely clearing whole swathes of forest
land at one go) and eco-labelling. The Swedes felt they simply had to have a
direct say in shaping policy in issues of such commercial importance to
their companies.
The nightmare scenario for Sweden's pulp and paper sector would be an EU
forestry policy that coupled maximum stress on recycling with maximum
emphasis on the preservation of existing forest areas.
At its most extreme, that could mean Sweden having to import recycled fibre
from the continent to meet EU rules on paper content. Or it could mean
Swedish companies being banned from clear-cutting. Rules such as these, were
they ever to be enforced, could raise costs in a country with enough natural
handicaps already in the form of slow tree growth and long distances to
markets. It could also hinder the access of Swedish companies to their main
markets.
Swedish forestry executives say they have nothing against recycling, but
they want a balanced view of its relationship with virgin fibre.
'Virgin fibre and recycled waste paper are two important components in the
same system,' says Dr Jan Remrod, director-general of the Swedish pulp and
paper association. He also advocates a broader view of waste management,
giving greater emphasis to energy recovery than has been the case until now.
'There are limits to the amount of times paper can be recycled and sometimes
the distances involved do not make it worthwhile. It would be a better idea
to take out the energy instead, producing heat and electricity which saves
coal and oil,' he says.
Pleased as they are by the outcome of the EU vote, it is already clear that
membership will carry a cost for the forestry groups. Mr Goran Persson,
Sweden's finance minister, has announced a series of new corporate, energy
and environment taxes to help fund the estimated SKr20bn annual cost of
Swedish EU membership.
Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, believes the measures will add
as much as SKr230m to its annual costs, including the impact of higher
social security charges.
But there is surprisingly little grumbling. That has probably got a lot to
do with the fact that Sweden's pulp and paper groups have enjoyed a much
better 1994 than they expected now that a strong cyclical recovery in the
sector is under way. Profits have grown as rising prices and strong demand
have driven up capacity utilisation and sales. The weak krona, cost-cutting
and lower debt burdens have also contributed to the upturn.
Prices are increasing for virtually all grades of paper and paperboard -
although the impact has yet to be fully felt in companies' profit-and-loss
accounts. Long fibre pulp prices have doubled in little more than a year and
are set to reach Dollars 750 per tonne by January 1. Prices for fine paper,
which has a high pulp content, have also climbed sharply, as have prices for
sawn timber. In other segments, such as publication papers, the impact has
been modest although big price rises are on the way.
A picture of an industry making a rapid return to health, after three
difficult years between 1991 and 1993, emerged at the nine-month stage.
Stora announced a profit of SKr2.04bn, seven times higher than the SKr294m
profit achieved in the same 1993 period. MoDo swung to a profit of SKr1.01bn
from a SKr427m loss while SCA lifted profits to SKr1.59bn from SKr788m. The
industry expects even better figures next year because of higher prices.
With balance sheets also in much better shape, companies are starting to
expand again, either by acquisition or by building new capacity. MoDo has
announced SKr3bn of new investments, including a SKr2.1bn outlay on a new
newsprint machine at its Braviken plant in Sweden. Stora is considering a
SKr2.8bn investment in a new board machine. AssiDoman has agreed to buy MoDo
Packaging in a deal worth SKr1.2bn.
Industry estimates suggest Swedish companies will invest as much as SKr8bn
in 1995, about the same amount as they invested annually in the late 1980s
at the last cyclical peak. This makes investors nervous because the downturn
that struck the industry in 1991 was caused more by overcapacity than weak
demand.
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish forestry groups invested
heavily in the UK, Germany and France because they wanted to establish
themselves close to their main markets. In the present expansion phase,
there are signs that a greater proportion of investments will be
concentrated at home.
This trend undoubtedly reflects the productivity gains achieved in the
Swedish forest industry over the past few years. Dr Remrod says the new
competitiveness and the need to exploit virgin fibre resources make it
natural for the expansion to be in Sweden. 'There is a need for more fresh
fibre in the system and the waste paper trend is balancing out,' he says.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (11): Too much money; not enough borrowers
 -Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago Swedish banks had too little money and too many loans going
sour. Today they have too much money and too few people wanting to borrow
it.
It is a striking recovery, if a rather lop-sided one. Healthy profits are
being made again but only because there has been a sharp drop in the volume
of the credit losses which crippled the sector two years ago. Underlying
results have actually deteriorated because of low credit demand, narrower
margins and reduced profits from bond trading.
The pattern is clear from the results of two of Sweden's leading
private-sector banks, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska
Handelsbanken. SE Banken made a nine-month profit of SKr2.87bn, a huge
improvement on SKr71m a year earlier, after credit losses shrank 44 per cent
to SKr4.35bn. But the result before loan losses, after stripping out hefty
capital gains, was down 17 per cent on 1993.
Handelsbanken achieved a SKr3.18bn profit - a 148 per cent improvement on
last year. This was because a 59 per cent drop in credit losses to SKr2.14bn
offset a 19 per cent fall in underlying results.
The drop in loan losses has been fuelled by Sweden's economic recovery and
low short-term interest rates. As for the underlying performance, Sweden's
banks are partly the victim of their own caution and partly of the general
state of the Swedish economy.
Having been brought to their knees two years ago by reckless lending to an
overheated property sector, they are now controlling their risk exposures
more carefully.
At the same time, customers have shied away from taking out new loans
because of weak private consumption, very high long-term real interest rates
and reduced tax incentives.
The problem is that the banks have never been in a better position to lend
money. They have strong capital ratios after the recapitalisation programmes
carried out last year and, due to high personal savings levels, deposits are
accumulating all the time. This means that after being undercapitalised two
years ago, they are now close to being overcapitalised. But if they are not
to turn away deposits, they have to do something with their surplus
liquidity. This has forced them to compete aggressively to lift market share
 -hence the narrower margins  - and expand their investment portfolios at a
time when the securities market has been turbulent.
This strategy has had painful consequences, particularly because of this
year's bond market turmoil. Bond trading profits are down sharply from last
year's levels, and investment portfolios have been hit by the difference
between market and purchase prices. The investment performance does not feed
through directly into the profit-and-loss account - as it does in Denmark -
but it does affect equity and capital cover.
Results are expected to improve further next year. Credit losses should
continue to fall, even though short-term interest rates are on the rise
again. Loan demand should also increase, particularly because of higher
investments by the country's big exporters. However, state tax increases and
spending cuts to curb the country's budget deficit will again hit private
consumption, curbing loan demand from the household sector.
Banks are not just looking to more robust loan demand to boost their
business. Services are being widened to include life insurance and more
sophisticated banking products. SE Banken, for example, has bought the
Diners Nordic credit card operation and set up an independent 24-hours-a-day
telephone banking service. Handelsbanken has become the first Swedish bank
to develop a flexible occupational pension scheme.
But competition is increasing. One of Sweden's leading insurers, Skandia,
has set up its own banking unit and the Post Office is offering a broader
range of banking services.
Competition within the Nordic region is also intensifying. Both SE Banken
and Handelsbanken are building up their operations in Finland and Norway.
Other Nordic banks are also planning to set up branches in Sweden. The
increasing cross-border competition was the main reason that four of the
region's top banks broke up a 10-year co-operation venture, Scandinavian
Banking Partners, during the summer.
The government has still not made any move to remove the blanket guarantee
which it put on the entire banking system in late 1992 at the height of the
banking crisis. There are several reasons for this.
One is that credit losses, though falling, are still not back to pre-crisis
levels. Handelsbanken's loan losses are still running at 1 per cent of total
lending, four times the level in the late 1980s. In addition,
Foreningsbanken, one of the main banks, is still not back in the black.
Secondly, Swedish long-term interest rates are high, and they are likely to
remain so until the markets are convinced that the government has got the
state debt under control.
Thirdly, the backing is supporting the banks' credit ratings.
Finally, the support has helped to sort out the banking crisis debris. For
example, when Securum, the state-owned entity set up to liquidate the failed
loans of Nordbanken, arranged a SKr20bn refinancing in the autumn, its task
was made easier by implicit backing from the Swedish state.
The banking crisis cost the Swedish state about SKr65bn in cash support.
Some of this will be recovered by the gradual dismantling of Securum, its
sister Retriva (the 'bad bank' for Gota Bank), and the return of Nordbanken
to the private sector.
Nordbanken, which collapsed into state arms in 1992 as the biggest casualty
of the crisis and has since been merged with Gota Bank, is due to be
re-privatised some time next year.
Securum's progress over the past year shows that the legacy of the crisis is
likely to be much shorter than was at first expected. The unit, which has
converted virtually all of its sour loans into assets, seems likely to
complete its liquidation programme within 10 years, having already sold
SKr9bn out of SKr51bn worth of assets. It would like to have returned at
least SKr10bn to the Swedish taxpayer by the end of the process.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (12): Travellers' guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stockholm, built on a string of islands and promontories where the Baltic
Sea meets the Malaren lake, is a beautiful city by any standard. Its wealth
of handsome architecture and grand waterfronts make it one of northern
Europe's most attractive centres.
The relative compactness of the heart of Stockholm means that even a busy
business visitor can savour much of what it has to offer. But to most
outsiders it is still an expensive place with quirks that can catch out an
unwary traveller.
How to get about: Beware the Middle Eastern-style bazaar for taxis at
Stockholm's main Arlanda airport. Most taxi companies offer a reduced rate
for the 40km ride to central Stockholm - of not more than SKr300 - but you
have to fix the fare in advance. If the driver runs the meter, you will pay
up to SKr600.
For those not pressed for time, the regular bus service to Centralen, the
central rail station, costs SKr50. If you stay in town, many appointments
will be within walking distance of your hotel. If you are anxious to cut
taxi costs, the Tunnelbana underground system is simple to use, efficient
and cheap.
Where to stay: If you want to stay on the waterfront, the prime hotels are
the Grand, the Strand and the Diplomat. All are within a short and pleasant
walk of the main government offices and business area of the city. Two other
big city centre hotels, the Sheraton and Royal Viking, can claim a
waterfront view, but in reality are hemmed in by busy thoroughfares. For
something cheaper and with more character try the Lady Hamilton or the Lord
Nelson on Gamla Stan, the old town.
Where to eat: If you are a fan of salmon and herring, Sweden is the place
for you. Otherwise, standard fare tends to be dull. A good value option for
lunch offered in dozens of restaurants is Dagens Ratt - a set menu, usually
including a light beer, for SKr45-SKr50. Lunch-hour in Sweden is noon-1pm.
Stockholm also boasts a range of quality, up-market restaurants. The
Smorgasbord at the Grand Hotel is justly famous for its sumptuous spread.
The Operakallaren at the Opera is good, but at lunchtime the Opera Bar is
cheaper and more fun.
Two good restaurants in beautiful settings are the Ulla Winblad on
Djurgarden and the pricey Ulriksdals Wardshus on Edsviken. Be warned,
however, that beer, wine and spirits prices in all restaurants are very
high.
Where to go: In summer take a boat trip to the islands. Look for the ferry
company information and ticket offices in front of the Grand Hotel (for the
archipelago) and the City Hall (for the Malaren). Vaxholm in the archipelago
is a good destination for a day, or half-day trip.
Take a lake steamer to the royal palace at Drottningholm for a summer treat
and go to the opera at the 18th century Drottningholms Slottsteater - but
tickets for the opera are hard to get at short notice.
There are several good museums in Stockholm. In the city, Gamla Stan, the
old town perched on an island, is a charming jumble of narrow streets and
old houses where a little exploration will turn up interesting antique
shops.
Other tips: Always check museum opening times in advance; Swedish tourist
attractions have an irritating habit of being closed in the summer because
all the locals are on holiday, and restricted in the winter because it is
not holiday time.
In early August, Stockholm hosts its annual water festival - which is great
fun, but also highly disruptive to normal business in the city centre.
In July, the city is all but dead as Swedes go on holiday en masse. Do not
plan a business trip then.
In winter, there is no decent downhill skiing in the Stockholm area - but if
you are a skater, visit in January and February. You could be in for the
treat of your life - skating on the lakes and the sea.
Finally, there is still a state monopoly on the retail sale of alcohol. If
you want to buy it, look for branches of the Systembolaget. They are only
open to 6pm on weekdays and are shut at weekends; most do not take credit
cards.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (10): Where success breeds
success - The banking sector's health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first glance, banks in the Czech Republic radiate good health.
Three of the largest, Komercni, Obchodni and Investnici, recently broke the
emerging markets equivalent of the four-minute mile. They raised or are
raising syndicated loans inter- nationally at less than one percentage point
over the London interbank rate: much less, at a spread of 65-70 basis
points.
These low borrowing rates owe much to the international reputation of the
Czech economy. But the banking system itself takes some of the credit. The
Czech Republic dealt early with the overhang of bad loans.
From 1991 on, banks hived off bad loans into a new institution, Konsolidacni
Banka. They cleaned up their balance sheets before the problem overwhelmed
them. The central bank said their capital should exceed 6.25 per cent of
assets by the end of 1993 and the banks have met the target.
Czech banks are in confident mood. Komercni and Invest- nici, corporate
bankers, and the savings institution Ceska Sporitelna began with specialist
roles but each is invading the others' patches with gusto. Komercni has
completed an energetic expansion of its branch network and Investnici has
bought into one by taking over Postovni, the post office bank. Sporitelna is
seeking to build a leading capital markets business on its cheap funding
base.
They follow less the example of the Anglo-Saxon lenders and more the
powerful universal banks of neighbouring Germany. Their fund management
companies have also grown through voucher privatisation and have made the
banks indirect investors, as well as lenders.
Influence on the board through seats held by fund management companies has
safeguarded banks' lending relationships, some believe. Mr Alex Angell of
brokers Wood &amp; Co says: 'That's why you see so little capital markets and
corporate finance activity in this market. Czech banks want to keep the
business for themselves.'
Banks have shown strong results at the operating level. The government has
pursued a deliberate policy of tolerance for high margins. The spread
between borrowing and deposit rates, while falling, still stands at 6 per
cent. Nor has this implicit subsidy all been frittered away on irresponsible
lending. Better lending discipline is demonstrated by one key statistic: new
loans after the revolution make up 90 per cent of Komercni's portfolio but
only 20 per cent of bad loans.
It sounds too good to all be true in a region where bank failures and
bail-outs have been endemic.
Even if big banks' bad debts are well covered now, they could easily
deteriorate. One westerner who has worked closely with a large Czech bank
says: 'Success is always measured in terms of bigness or being first with a
product. I keep telling them: our job is to make money, we are not a
utility.
'There is no credit culture that pervades the bank. There is still no
deterrent to making bad loans. You don't get fired if it happens.'
Ownership of stakes in borrowing companies can also be a source of potential
problems. 'Banks are wearing two hats here. They obviously take a dim view
of getting tough on clients when they are share- holders,' says a western
investment banker.
Nor does a shareholding always stave off competition for lending business.
Suitors surround CEZ, the electricity utility. And Komercni, for instance,
lost the Czech tobacco company as a client when it was taken over by Philip
Morris. Citicorp was the beneficiary. Margins are also coming under pressure
as western banks make inroads into the Czech corporate market.
The Czech banking policy has been expensive. Mr Ales Barabas, board member
of Zivnotenska Banka, says: 'The government is pumping money into the banks,
don't worry. It is just that here it is not public.'
The foundation of Konsol- idacni was in itself a pre-emptive bail-out. The
Czech government's liberal distribution of guarantees on corporate loans
also reduces banks' need to provision and boosts capital.
Three small banks nevertheless failed earlier this year. Agrobanka, the
fifth largest bank, applied international standards to its accounts and
discovered that provisions had wiped out its capital in 1993. Further bank
failures are a distinct possibility. 'My guess is that there is a much
larger hit looming than has been acknowledged,' says one western adviser.
The Czech National Bank classified loans more rigorously than ever before
for its September data and found that 35 per cent are bad, compared with 22
per cent as measured before.
When the Hungarian authorities conducted their first in-depth analysis of
banks' portfolios they found that the two largest commercial banks had nega-
tive capital equivalent to about 8 per cent of assets and were technically
insolvent. The Czech National Bank refuses to give adjusted figures for
capital adequacy. Mr Ota Kaftan, head of supervision at the central bank,
says only: 'It is not a catastrophe.'
The large banks claim they have already moved over to international
accounting and so the change in calculation does not apply to them. Komercni
says it made the shift in 1992 and now has met the Basle recommendation of 8
per cent capital adequacy.
But other, smaller banks face a brutal realisation that full provisioning
will totally exhaust their capital. Even Mr Kaftan admits: 'There could be
some banks in the system which could have negative capital adequacy.'
Leading banks stand to gain from a flight of deposits to quality that a
further wave of bank failures would prompt. But those which lend on the
interbank market such as Ceska Sporitelna will be hit. Wood &amp; Co says
Sporitelna suffered an estimated Kc4bn loan loss to the three small banks
that have already gone bankrupt. Three more banks are considered at risk and
Price Waterhouse, Sporitelna's auditor, has commented that Ks4bn worth of
provisions may not be adequate.
Despite the prospect of further loan losses and a tightening of capital
adequacy calculations, Mr Kaftan is adamant that the Czech banking sector
will reach the 8 per cent ratio by the time the country applies to join the
European Union in 1996.
So far, Czech banks have proved able to restore their capital through rights
issues on the Czech stock market and issuance of subordinated debt. Komercni
raised Kc8bn in March and Ceska Sporitelna Kc7bn in September.
Mr Ales Barabas, board member of Zivnotenska Banka responsible for the
bank's investment fund, says: 'To be honest, I'm surprised that the rights
issues are running so well. I personally would not participate.' But success
breeds success, and as long as Czech banks can keep up the appearance of
solidity they should be able to fund themselves out of crisis. Ultimately,
it is all a matter of confidence.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (11): Honest broker strikes
gold - Profile: Wood &amp; Co
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prague, Budapest and Warsaw teem with young westerners seeking fame and
fortune on the new business frontier. They have taken up the latest career
advice: Go east, young man, writes Nicholas Denton.
Only a few have struck gold. One of them is Richard Wood. He came to Prague
with no particular plan and no Czech connections. Aged 34, he is now
managing director and main shareholder of the Czech Republic's top
independent brokerage house, Wood &amp; Co.
His is no rags-to-riches story. Mr Wood was a vice-president at Salomon
Brothers in London, specialising in sales of fixed income derivative
products. He brought to the Czech Republic his last, bumper bonus, a
relationship with Salomon and City contacts. Not to mention a taste for
green braces and salmon-pink shirts.
It has been, nonetheless, an adventure. What more dramatic time to make the
break than New Year's Eve as 1989 turned to 1990 with eastern Europe's
revolutions playing on the television screens. 'It was like getting on the
Mayflower and going to America except it was only an hour and a half away,'
says Mr Wood.
When Czech voucher privatisation began, Mr Wood toyed with the idea of
setting up an investment fund. Everybody was doing that, but nobody was
getting set up to broker between the funds. That's what Mr Wood did.
Wood &amp; Co's key advantage is that it is independent. Other domestic brokers
are owned by banks which also control fund management companies. 'Richard
has been very smart. He has established a niche business as honest broker
between the investment funds,' says Mr Nigel Williams, managing director of
Creditanstalt Investment Company, and another City boy who has made it in
the Czech Republic.
Wood &amp; Co has also brought to the Czech Republic a western focus on the
client and reputation. 'Our Czech salespeople here actively develop
relationships with Czech fund managers,' says Mr Wood. There are always
rumours that brokers trade on the back of their clients but most believe Mr
Wood's passionate assertion that reputation is the firm's most important
asset. It is particularly powerful in eastern Europe, where capitalism is
often synonymous with the quick buck.
Honesty in a crooked market can be expensive. Wood &amp; Co struck a deal to buy
shares for a client. The seller saw the price was going up, reneged on his
deal and sold to someone else for 10 per cent more. Wood &amp; Co had to fork up
the difference. The company sued but could not convince the court that a
person's word should be a bond. The broker estimates his company has lost
Dollars 1m this year from settlement failures. 'At times we've almost wiped
ourselves out to deliver securities,' he says.
Nevertheless, Wood is now a port of call for western funds investing in the
Czech Republic. The company estimates it handles about 40 per cent of
brokered equity trading, more than any competitor.
In recent weeks it has set up operations in Warsaw. This pan-Slav strategy
has distinct practical advantages: Czech and Polish are similar. Analysts
can visit companies in the other country and more or less communicate.
Wood &amp; Co's local experience and growing regional network give it a powerful
competitive edge, but eastern Europe's stock markets are maturing. At the
moment, emerging market funds, hedge funds and private investors are the
most active players. Over time, a wider circle of institutional investors,
including risk-averse pension funds, will include the region's shares in
their portfolio.
Wood &amp; Co will need an alliance with an international investment bank to
reach that market. 'Together with a western institution we could do more,'
Mr Wood admits. There have been approaches and he appears open to them. A
tie-up would close a chapter in Richard Wood's east European adventure. It
could also leave him seriously rich.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (7): Growing rapidly - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tourism is one of Sweden's fastest-growing sectors and, although the trade
is relatively young, ranks as the country's third-largest industry,
generating annual turnover of an estimated SKr98bn of which SKr21bn is
derived from foreign tourists.
The attraction of Sweden has to be, among many things, the country's
unspoilt environment and alluring scenery comprising 60,000 islands, 90,000
lakes, a 4,725-mile coastline and endless forests. There are also 350
museums in the country and a wide variety of special events throughout the
year.
The tourist industry peaked in 1989 when turnover hit SKr100bn, but
nose-dived by nearly SKr80bn during 1990-91 when the then Social Democratic
government led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, increased value added tax on tourism
to 25 per cent in two stages.
The VAT increase coincided with the onset of the deepest recession to hit
Sweden since the second world war. But the industry recovered during 1991-93
after a new conservative Moderate government, led by Mr Carl Bildt,
reorganised the marketing of tourism and cut VAT to 12 per cent.
These factors were aided by the start of a recovery in the economy which
began at the end of 1993.
Nevertheless, even after the rate cut, Sweden's VAT remains significantly
higher than the European average. The Swedes argue vigorously that prices in
their country have become competitive with the rest of Europe while a main
priority of marketing seeks to dispel 'the myth' that Sweden is far too
expensive to be considered a holiday destination by more than just the
elite.
'Surveys show that many foreigners still believe that Sweden is too
expensive. Heavy resources are therefore being invested in marketing Sweden
abroad,' the Swedish Trade Council said in its 1994 annual report on the
country.
In the first nine months of this year, the number of overnight stays in
Swedish hotels by foreigners rose 13 per cent compared with the year-earlier
period, and industry executives are predicting that 1994 will be a record
year in terms of growth. Last year, foreigners' overnight stays alone
reached 6.1m.
During the first nine months of 1994, Dutch and Danish tourists accounted
for the highest growth rate in overnight stays in percentage terms, rising
respectively 25 per cent and 26 per cent while US visitors rose by 14 per
cent.
German tourists, the largest group of foreign visitors to Sweden, increased
their overnight stays by 13 per cent and UK tourists 11 per cent.
Another indication of the strength of this year's activity is a forecast
rise in the number of cruise ship passengers calling on Stockholm alone. It
is estimated that international cruise ships will make 125 visits to the
capital city this year, carrying a total of 70,000 passengers, representing
an increase of 10,000 passengers over 1993.
Mr Per-Johann Orrby, president of Next Stop Sweden (NSS), the Swedish Travel
and Tourist Council, attributes the rise in tourism's fortunes partly to
Sweden's attractive prices - in foreign currency terms - since the krona was
devalued by nearly 30 per cent in 1992. The reduction of VAT and a slight
recovery of the economy are also considered significant.
NSS reckons that sterling buys 15 per cent more in Sweden since the
devaluation, while the purchasing power of the US dollar has risen 18 per
cent and the German mark 30 per cent.
But the Swedes probably also have their next-door Nordic neighbours to thank
for foreign interest, following Norway's success in arranging the Winter
Olympics earlier this year.
For more than two weeks in February, hours and hours of pristine, sunlit
'Scandinavian' winter images were broadcast worldwide from Lillehammer in
Norway. Such coverage undoubtedly had a spill-over affect for Sweden and
must have improved the country's standing as a tourist destination.
The Olympics boosted Norway's tourist industry by as much as 5 per cent this
year but it would be difficult to quantify the effect it had on Swedish
tourism.
According to Mr Jan Brannstrom, managing director of Image Sweden, the
state-backed agency which promotes Sweden internationally, recent studies
revealed that about half the foreign tourists visiting Sweden do so as part
of a Scandinavian tour. But, he said, there were no plans for a joint
Scandinavian tourism marketing effort and, in the long-run, he saw few, if
any, benefits from such a scheme.
Another important factor which has undoubtedly lifted the awareness of
Sweden abroad is the apparent success of the big overhaul of the
organisational structure of marketing services for tourism. The Swedish
Tourist Board was dismantled and Image Sweden established together with NSS.
Image Sweden purchases marketing services from NSS for an estimated NKr60m
annually.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (8): Nuclear deadline looms - Christopher
Brown-Humes examines energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden is a country with one of the safest nuclear power industries in the
world - and yet it has committed itself to phasing out nuclear power
entirely by the year 2010. Perhaps only in a country of such dogged
environmental idealism could so dramatic a move be contemplated when nuclear
power accounts for close to 50 per cent of electricity production.
Nuclear power has been a hot potato in Sweden for 20 years. The issue has
nagged away with varying degrees of intensity in the political debate, even
helping to decide the outcome of one general election.
It has gained added urgency every time there is a nuclear spillage beyond
Sweden's borders, such as the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster in the US and
the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986. Now, as the 2010 deadline
looms, a new urgency has developed and a new political crisis may be in the
offing. If the final deadline is to be met, a date for the phase-out of the
first of the 12 reactors has to be fixed soon.
In many countries, the practicalities of the matter would decide the issue.
Most of Sweden's nuclear power plants are nowhere near the end of their
technical lives. Replacing them would be extremely costly, there are no easy
alternatives, and there is an obvious risk of higher electricity prices.
But in Sweden there is a strong political will to phase out the
controversial energy source completely. The Centre, Christian Democrat, Left
and Environment parties have all tied themselves to the anti-nuclear mast.
More importantly, the Social Democratic prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson,
is personally committed to the phase-out, saying 2010 is 'a realistic
commitment.' His party, however, is split on the question.
The 2010 date was set by parliament in 1980 after a national referendum in
which Swedes voted to dismantle their nuclear industry. The date chosen was
25 years after the last of Sweden's reactors was commissioned in 1985. Why
25 years? Because that was assumed to be a nuclear plant's technical
lifespan just because it is the standard depreciation period for Swedish
nuclear assets.
The issue again came to the fore in the late 1980s when parliament decided
to dismantle the first two plants in 1995 and 1996. However this commitment
was side-stepped as part of a three-way accord between the Social Democrats,
the Centre Party and the Liberals in early 1991. The 2010 target, however,
remained in place.
The importance of nuclear power to Sweden is not contested. Last year it
generated 58.9 terawatts of power, or 41.8 per cent of the country's
electricity needs. Hydro-electric power produced 73.3 TWh, or 52 per cent.
Ironically, the improving efficiency of Swedish nuclear plants and the
expected re-commissioning of a plant that has been out of service means the
nuclear contribution is predicted to rise over the next two years. Next
year, nuclear electricity output could reach 69.0 TWh, 48 per cent of the
total.
This is a huge hole for other power sources to fill. The difficulty has been
exacerbated because 'renewable' energy sources such as wind, solar energy
and biomass have not become as commercially viable as was expected at the
time of the 1980 referendum.
In fact, Sweden is being forced to try and reconcile a number of mutually
incompatible objectives. It wants to be rid of nuclear power, but it is not
prepared to dam more rivers in the north of the country to increase
hydro-power generation. It cannot insist on renewables, but it knows that
falling back on coal and gas would increase carbon dioxide emissions.
Finally, it wants to maintain internationally competitive energy prices and
protect jobs.
In other words, there are no easy answers. Heavy investments in coal and
gas-fired power plants look to be the only realistic alternatives, but that
could cost the country a staggering SKr200bn, according to some estimates.
The problems might eventually be eased by a broad deregulation of the
Swedish, Nordic and even north European power markets. But the Social
Democrats have just postponed deregulation of the Swedish market, which was
due to take effect on January 1 1995, and the deregulation of the north
European market still looks to be some way off.
For the moment, the issue is again on hold. A commission has been
established to map out a realistic Swedish energy policy, covering
everything from nuclear power to deregulation. Its task will be to detail
the costs and environmental implications of the different solutions before
the end of next year.
Power industry experts are convinced that the 2010 date will be dropped. 'I
have never thought the politicians would go ahead with the phase-out,' says
Dr Karl-Axel Edin, president of Tentum, a Stockholm energy consultancy. 'The
safety of nuclear power has increased more than tenfold since the referendum
and energy sources like wind-power and biomass are not going to fill the
gap.'
The assessment may well be correct - but that does not mean there will not
be another political crisis over the issue or that one or two nuclear plants
will not be sacrificed along the way.
Mr Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, author of A History of Swedish Nuclear Power,
believes there could be another referendum on the issue. Alternatively, he
suggests the deadline could be postponed as a gesture to some future
political partner, such as the Liberals, if the minority Social Democratic
government was ever forced into a coalition. But Mr Leijonhufvud notes that
Mr Carlsson is 'morally bound' over the 2010 deadline and believes it could
even prove to be the issue on which the 60-year-old party veteran eventually
decides to step down.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (9): Exploiting their leverage - The Greens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After failing to break through the required 4 per cent threshold to enter
the Riksdag (parliament) during the last three-year session, Sweden's
fledgling Environment Party (Miljopartiet) - popularly known as the Greens -
captured 5 per cent of the vote in the September elections and see the
party's future going from strength to strength.
The Greens find themselves back in parliament for the second time since they
were formed in 1981 as the country's first new political party in 70 years.
Their roots are in the so-called 'alternative movement' which emerged in the
1970s to champion the causes of not only the environment, but also peace and
womens' equality while opposing nuclear weapons and energy.
They first entered the Riksdag in 1988 for a three-year parliamentary term,
backed by a vote of 5.5 per cent. But, in 1985, the Greens scored at local
level, winning 237 seats on 148 local councils which they tripled three
years later to 698 seats on 260 out of 284 councils. They also forged ahead
at regional level in 1988, when they won 101 seats and representation on all
25 county councils.
There were teething problems in the early days as the Greens seemed more a
curiosity than anything else. But important political events such as the Rio
Conference on the environment in Brazil in 1991 has boosted the credibility
of Green parties worldwide with their main cause having been elevated to the
international agenda.
In Sweden, the Greens' platform has changed little over the past 10 years,
although it is now presented in a less idealistic and less fundamentalist
tone. Among other things, they favour energy taxes - so-called environmental
taxes or Green taxes - as a means to make pollution expensive, promote
recycling and reduce traffic. They support a 35-hour work week so that more
people can be put to work - Sweden's present 13.8 per cent unemployment rate
is unprecedented since the second world war. They continue to push for rapid
closure of Sweden's nuclear power plants and adamantly oppose plans for a
hazardous waste disposal facility.
'Our return to the Riksdag did not represent the protest vote which some
claim. . . it meant that when we were out of parliament the last time,
people genuinely missed the fact that environmental issues had disappeared
from the debate,' said Ms Marianne Samuelsson, 49, a mother of three, joint
leader of the Greens and an MP.
'When we were in (the Riksdag) before, the other parties saw benefits to
gain votes by elevating environmental issues to their agenda. This was
superficial. What happened on the environment front during 1991-94 when we
were out? Very little, if anything - and this did not go unnoticed by the
electorate, particularly by women and youth,' she said.
It was primarily women and the youth vote which propelled the Greens back
into the Riksdag this year. Ms Samuelsson concedes that the Greens lost out
in 1991 because of inefficiency and disarray: 'We simply did not have our
act together.' But Greens throughout Europe hit a five-year low after 1988
which coincided with a right-wing wave of politics and from which they
managed only this year to recover, according to political analysts.
Sweden's Greens ran on an anti-European Union ticket for the September
elections and this undoubtedly shored up their support ahead of Sweden's
November referendum on EU membership which was opposed by almost half the
electorate.
During the period when it was out of power, the party reorganised and did
some deep soul-searching to regain its confidence which was battered by the
1991 defeat.
'The leadership in Sweden of the Green party has become more seasoned, more
experienced and less fundamentalist than their earlier years. They have
shown that they are a party with whom political deals can be struck,' said
Professor Soran Holmberg, at Gothenberg University where he is department
head of political science and head of a special election studies team.
The Greens' joint male-female party leadership is meant to demonstrate that
party commitments also include gender equality. Ms Samuelsson became
co-leader of the party in 1992 together with Mr Birger Schlaug. The Greens
have the highest proportional female representation in the Riksdag of any
national party. The party holds 18 seats and is represented on 16
parliamentary committees.
The Greens are also members of the 20-country European Green Party
Federation, and have endorsed its programme which rejects the Maastricht
Treaty and the Western European Union. With Sweden's slim Yes vote on EU
membership, the Green party intends, through the federation, to make its
voice heard in Brussels, because the party has little faith that Ms Anita
Gradin, Sweden's EU Commissioner, will make environmental issues a priority.
'I'm disappointed that Sweden did not get a person in Brussels who is
engaged in environmental issues - Anita Gradin simply is not,' said Ms
Samuelsson.
'The situation in Europe is developing one way - the wrong way. There is
more traffic and more chemicals. . . the list goes on. . . and this cannot
continue if we have any conscience at all about leaving the earth in
reasonable shape for coming generations,' she said.
The Greens advocate a referendum throughout the Nordic countries in either
1996 or 1997 on the EU's next phase of economic and monetary union.
'Basically, we oppose the EU's common economic and monetary policy - not all
countries are equal - and as for the WEU, this is not a peace organisation.
After the US, the EU is the world's second-biggest producer of weapons. This
means weapons will remain high on the EU's agenda because Europe's economies
depend on their production for revenue.
'Sweden has WEU observer status which means it will have access to all WEU
information, undermining the government's claim of being 'alliance-free'.
This also raises questions over the government's stand on a future common EU
military force, although the prime minister has suggested a referendum may
be needed,' Ms Samuelsson said.
Professor Holmberg believes that the Greens' anti-EU stance will benefit the
party in the long run. 'They were helped by the 'EU dimension' and the
ongoing (EU) debate in Sweden will help their future as they try to slow
Sweden's integration into Europe. Their main political competition is the
Left party who they will always have to look over their shoulder to monitor.
. . both of these parties have the most volatile voters in Sweden,' he said.
The Greens believe their return to the Riksdag will strengthen the party's
ties to the ruling minority Social Democratic party.
'They depend on the Left (party) for support for all the budget cuts and
other proposals to reduce the deficit. They won't get support from the Left
on many of their plans. . . which means they will have to rely on us,' Ms
Samuelsson said - a reminder that Sweden's political situation gives the
Greens a degree of leverage in the Riksdag which they aim to exploit.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (9): Vitkovice is afloat
without a life-raft - Steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Communists in general, and Comrade Stalin in particular, were obsessed with
steel. It was an obsession that lumbered former Czechoslovakia with dozens
of smoky steel plants, and an enormous industrial restructuring problem when
communism fell.
The Czech Republic alone has over 20 steel and metallurgy companies, and
many will not survive. Vitkovice, the republic's largest integrated steel
and engineering complex, is determined to be one that will pull through. Mr
Jaroslav Dusilek, Vitkovice's finance director says bluntly: 'We will not
close down.'
Two years ago, he was not so sure. Like much of Czech heavy industry
Vitkovice, based in Ostrova, northern Moravia, had drawn up a reconstruction
plan which relied heavily on government funding. But soon after the June
1992 elections, the new government, headed by Mr Vaclav Klaus, made it
abundantly clear that such companies would have to swim along without the
aid of a government life-raft.
Vitkovice, which has to produce at an optimal level of 1m tons of steel and
core products to survive, was forced to jump in at the deep end. It has
already shed 16,000 employees since 1989 and its current workforce of 23,000
is targeted to fall to 18,000 by the end of the decade. While reducing the
labour force, mainly through voluntary retirement, it is also planning to
reduce its dependency on steel production and boost its engineering
division.
The company has invested Kc1.5bn a year since 1992, much of it on a Kc2.4bn
continuous slab caster to modernise steel production. But it is also saddled
with heavy environmental costs, currently Kc200m annually, to reduce
hazardous discharges and waste.
Mr Dusilek claims that Ostrava, a bleak industrial city of 330,000 people
dominated by the sprawling Vitkovice plant, is 'cleaner than Prague'. Yet
neither is particularly clean, though better than they were in communist
times when ecological concerns were not an overriding factor.
Steel production currently accounts for 56 per cent of Vitkovice's total
output, but is scheduled to decline to 45 per cent by 2003, according to a
new strategic plan which has just hit Mr Dusilek's desk. The company's main
product is hot rolled thick plates used in shipbuilding and boilers. It also
makes long products such as seamless tubes used by the oil industry.
Its engineering division, which currently accounts for 30 per cent of total
production, concentrates on marine crankshafts, of which it claims to be one
of the two leading world producers with 16 per cent of the global market. It
also makes components for nuclear power plants, and was the main supplier of
such products to Soviet-designed reactors until 1989.
Since the collapse of Comecon, Vitkovice has had to fight hard for new
markets. This has inevitably brought it into conflict with western steel
producers, which invoked anti-dumping clauses to restrict exports of
seamless tubes and other products to European Union markets.
Mr Dusilek denies allegations that Czech and Slovak steel makers, and
seamless tube producers in particular, are guilty of dumping products in the
EU. When lower labour costs and depreciation are excluded, 'all our costs
are at international market levels,' he says.
The biggest proportion of Vitkovice's output is still consumed by local
engineering industries. But the company now exports 47 per cent of total
production, of which 55 per cent goes to the EU, mainly Germany, and a third
to Slovakia.
Until the collapse of communism 30 per cent of the company's production,
mainly engineering products, was exported to Comecon markets, with the rest
sold domestically. The great difference today is that its new customers pay
for what they receive. Vitkovice lost Kc1bn in 1993 after being forced to
write off unpaid debts by former Soviet customers.
Meanwhile, Vitkovice is benefiting from the end of the recession in the
steel industry worldwide which is pushing up export prices and volumes.
Profits this year are expected to reach Kc400m. In the 10 months to October,
it reported turnover of Kc18bn and sales of Kc12.7bn, of which Kc6bn was
exported.
Rising profitability is essential if the company is to earn enough to
complete its restructuring plans. Much of Czech heavy industry is still
largely state-owned, but the recently completed second wave of coupon
privatisation included blocks of shares in many 'difficult' industries,
including steel.
Vitkovice was included in the wave, with almost 25 per cent of the company's
shares sold to private investors. Another 5 per cent is owned by the city of
Ostrava, which depends on the company for its own survival. The state
retains two-thirds.
Vitkovice has tried to woo a partner among western steel companies, and
hired UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in 1992 to draw up an 'information memorandum' to
sell the company's divisions to potential investors, including British Steel
and Thyssen.
That move coincided with the worst of the recession in the world steel
industry, and so far there have been no takers. Vitkovice is now trying to
secure long-term co-operation agreements which may include an equity
partnership. It is hoping that the improved international outlook for the
steel industry will help.
What potential investors will be buying into is the Czech Republic's third
biggest company, with a colourful past and a potentially prosperous future
as industrial growth resumes, provided it can complete its modernisation
while its low cost base gives it a price advantage.
It may be the only steel company in the world to have been founded by an
archbishop. In 1828 Rudolf Jan, archbishop of Olomouc in central Moravia,
built a smelter in Vitkovice, which was then a tiny village. Jan was a
member of the Hapsburg dynasty, and owned ore mines in Sweden and coal mines
in the Ostrava region.
The plant was bought in 1843 by a branch of the Rothschild family, and
remained in their hands until it was seized by the Nazis in 1939. The state
of Czechoslovakia settled with the Rothschilds in 1947, so that Vitkovice
was not subject to restitution after the Velvet Revolution.
Earlier this month, the Rothschild family resumed its severed connection
with the Czechs when Sir Evelyn de Rothschild came to Prague to sign a joint
venture agreement between NM Rothschild and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka.
For Vitkovice such agreements could augur foreign investor interest even in
sectors such as steel, where the future looked so bleak three years ago.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (8): Setbacks lead to
reassessment - Foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czech Republic's political stability and a consistent economic policy,
pursued by a group of technocratic politicians with the zeal of true
converts, has made the country a favourite of foreign investors.
The government of Mr Vaclav Klaus has created a pro-reform consensus that
has seen markets deregulated, state enterprises wholly or partly sold off,
and the completion of a huge privatisation programme that has turned the
Czechs into a nation of budding bourgeois capitalists.
One of the rewards has been the granting of coveted investment grade status
to the country by the international ratings agencies. The Czech Republic is
rated BAA3 by Moody's and BBB-plus by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Since 1990, and especially since 1992 when Mr Klaus became prime minister,
foreign buyers have taken substantial stakes in the country's automotive,
tobacco, food and construction industries. A total of Dollars 2.7bn in
foreign direct investment was committed by the end of September this year,
with expectations of Dollars 3bn by the year-end. This is less than half the
levels seen in Hungary, where privatisation has moved much more slowly, but
more than Poland, which has four times the population but is seen as more
politically unstable.
Significantly, the Czech Republic has attracted this level of investment
without offering tax breaks or other incentives. On the contrary. 'Why
should we subsidise foreign companies to compete unfairly against Czech
companies?' Mr Klaus provocatively asks those who urge such measures. It is
an approach that is paying off. CzechInvest, the agency for foreign
investment, says that serious foreign investors appreciate the absence of
incentives, seeing this as further evidence of the government's commitment
to the law of the market.
The biggest and most crucial foreign investor to date is Volkswagen, which
bought 31 per cent of Skoda, the Czech carmaker, in 1991. Europe's biggest
carmaker is due to raise its stake to 70 per cent by the end of 1995.
Confirmation of the eventual handover of control to Volkswagen was agreed
this year after a difficult renegotiation of the original 1991 agreement.
This followed the German carmaker's embarrassing abandonment of earlier
plans to invest up to Dm9bn in Skoda by the end of the decade.
Other big investors include Philip Morris, which spent Dollars 420m buying
80 per cent of Tabak, the Czech tobacco monopoly, and modernising production
at its Kutna Hora facility; BSN and Nestle. The latter bought into
Cokoladovny, a confectionery maker, in a joint venture in 1992 and now
controls the company. Another big investor is ABB, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering giant, which employs 6,000 people in Brno, the country's second
city, in a range of power engineering and electronics products ventures.
US multinationals have also been substantial investors in the fast food and
consumer goods sectors, but investment is not confined to the household
names. Earlier this year, for example, the small US pharmaceuticals group
Ivax bought majority control of Galena, the second biggest pharmaceutical
company.
Success is now bringing new problems for foreign investors. Czech attitudes,
especially in political and business circles, have altered as company
managers come to terms with the mechanics of restructuring. Some high
profile deals with foreign investors have come spectacularly unstuck.
The trigger was Volkswagen's scaling back of its plans for Skoda, which
threatened to make the Czech venture a mere sideshow in the Volkswagen group
and cause large-scale redundancies at its Mlada Boleslav plant. Putting a
brave face on what has undoubtedly been a severe embarrassment for the
government, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the trade and industry minister, defends the
renegotiated agreement, though its terms have not been revealed. In
hindsight, he says, the original deal was too optimistic. 'There were
mistakes on both sides in signing the original agreement,' he adds.
The Volkswagen setback was followed in March this year by the withdrawal of
Air France from Czechoslovak Airlines. Air France and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development each bought 19.1 per cent stakes two years
before in a Dollars 60m investment. After a lot of haggling, an exasperated
government bought out the French stake and began looking for Czech backers
to provide support for the heavily indebted airline.
These setbacks, and controversy over the future of the petrochemical
industry, have led many Czechs to reassess the merits of foreign investment.
The country's success in other areas of economic reform, especially in
coupon privatisation, sent expectations soaring, but the foreign investment
controversies were a blow to national pride.
There could be danger ahead. 'We are now in a period of euphoria over our
own success - we risk overestimating our own capabilities,' says Mr Jan
Havelka, chairman of CzechInvest. Western bankers in Prague dismiss the
notion that the Czechs can complete the task of restructuring without
foreign capital. Huge areas of the economy, including such industries as
banking, brewing, energy, mining and metallurgy, are heavily
undercapitalised and unable to finance restructuring on their own.
A big test of the new mood towards foreign investment will come early next
year when the government decides on a strategic partner for SPT Telecom, the
telecommunications company in which the state is selling a 27 per cent stake
for around Dollars 1bn.
The deal is shaping up to be the biggest one-off investment yet in the
country, as well as the biggest telecoms deal in eastern Europe. Mr Karel
Dyba, the economy minister, is overseeing the tender and has promised to run
an open and transparent process, partly to restate a commitment to foreign
investment and partly to shake off allegations of shady dealing in earlier
privatisations where transparency took a back seat.
Away from the big deals, some private Czech companies are looking to raise
new capital directly by wooing international institutional investors. Mr Ivo
Lurvink, head of CS First Boston in Prague, says foreign investors are
looking increasingly at emerging industries such as media and entertainment
rather than at established sectors which still have much restructuring ahead
of them.
An additional factor that will enhance the Czech Republic's attractiveness
as an investment location may come about as early as next year when the
koruna, the national currency, is expected to become fully convertible. The
Czech National Bank is pushing for the move early, but is facing opposition
from Mr Klaus.
The currency, widely considered undervalued, is expected to jump against the
dollar and D-mark in the event of full convertibility, hurting the country's
booming exports in its newly-won and valuable western European markets.
'Czech goods compete on price, not on quality,' says Mr David Svojitka, head
of treasury at Bayerische Vereinsbank in Prague.
Large inflows of speculative capital attracted by high interest rates and
the chance of koruna appreciation sent the money supply soaring to 20 per
cent by October and are threatening to push inflation above the CNB's target
of 10 per cent for the year. This type of capital inflow, with its
destabilising potential, has received the particular wrath of the
government.
Mr Klaus is understood to want to leave the question of convertibility until
after general elections in 1996. By then, the proposed sale of the SPT
Telecom stake and a potential Dollars 700m investment in oil refining by a
consortium of Shell, Agip, Conoco and Total will have been decided.
Future attention is expected to focus on the hundreds of newly privatised
and start-up companies which are in desperate need of fresh capital and good
management to turn the promise of privatisation into a reality. Potential
investors are now scouring the provincial towns and villages for hidden
jewels whose turnaround will be profitable for them, and good for the
continued health of the economy.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (6): Officials fear wedge - Relations with
Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you ask officials what course relations between Sweden and Norway will
take in the wake of Sweden's 'Yes' last month to membership of the European
Union and Norway's rejection of membership, 'status quo' is the united
response, writes Karen Fossli.
Privately, however, they express fears that a wedge may have been driven
between the two countries by the different outcomes of their referendums on
EU membership.
Norwegian officials fear that at some point Sweden will be forced to ask
itself 'What's in it for me?' when deciding between Nordic co-operation and
EU loyalty.
For Norway, a 90-year union with Sweden and before that a 434-year union
with Denmark, were both forced marriages which partly explains Norwegians'
icy response to joining anything resembling a union. Norwegians are quick to
point out that during both unions the country lost its identity and the
people lost their language.
Norway relinquished neutrality following the occupation by Nazi Germany
during the second world war and became a founding member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). Sweden, which was not occupied during
the war, has maintained neutrality.
In joining the EU, Sweden will attain observer status at the Western
European Union (WEU), but the country is loathe to subscribe to full
membership. Norway has WEU observer status.
Norway says Sweden relies on its ties to Nato. 'This has always been vital
for Sweden and has contributed to allowing the country to maintain
neutrality,' one Norwegian official explained.
In 1952, the Nordic countries established the Nordic Council through which
co-operation has since been undertaken. Resolutions unanimously passed in
the Council are binding for the Nordic governments but in some cases must be
approved by their individual national assemblies. Foreign policy and
security policy fall outside Nordic co-operation, however.
Mr Carl Bildt, the former Swedish conservative Moderate prime minister,
suggested last month that formal Nordic co-operation be dismantled in view
of the broad Nordic expansion into the EU. But, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Sweden's
prime minister, has so far resisted such a move.
'There is a limit to what Sweden could do (to this end), if it was to do
anything at all, because there would be a public outcry if Nordic
co-operation was to end. . . and this gives Norway some protection,' a
Norwegian official said.
Last month, the Nordic Council agreed that co-operation should be reformed
to take into account 'a wider international outlook'. Nevertheless, Norway
fears that the Nordic Council might become obsolete, or take a back seat to
the EU, now that all of the Nordic countries except itself and Iceland have
become EU members.
One of the most significant achievements of the Nordic Council is that of
joint labour markets, set up 20 years ago, and the introduction of
unrestricted passage between Nordic states. Swedes can work and live in
Norway or other Nordic countries and vice-versa. Officials do not foresee
interruptions in these agreements just because Norway is outside the EU but
both sides see controls at the new EU Swedish-Norwegian border being
tightened.
Swedish customs officials say they have received no signals from Brussels
that things should change. The Norwegians, however, fear that an existing
drain of trade to Sweden at the frontier will become exacerbated by the new
EU border. Norwegians have for years been motoring to Sweden where food
prices in particular are significantly lower and are set to decline as a
result of EU membership.
Local Swedish authorities are already attempting to persuade Norwegian
companies to relocate 'just over the border into the EU' and advertising
campaigns spelling out the benefits are in full swing. Some local
authorities are offering incentives such as free building plots and cash
advances towards hiring staff.
Norwegian officials plan to increase the number of customs officials posted
at the frontier. Before it decided to become an EU member, Sweden planned to
cut border staff but it may now have to increase staffing.
Norway is deeply concerned about domestic companies relocating to Sweden.
Already, some Norwegian fish processing companies have moved to Sweden, and
others warn they will follow in order to benefit economically from not
having to pay tariffs on processed fish exported between EU countries.
Processed fish exported by Norway to the EU is subject to a complex system
of tariffs. But another benefit for companies relocating to Sweden is that
they can qualify for support from the EU's regional fund. Norway is
therefore considering establishing a 'free enterprise zone' in specific
counties at the EU frontiers of Sweden and Finland but has yet to give
details.
Officials in Sweden and Norway are disappointed with Norway's 'No' vote.
Sweden and Finland counted had on Norway joining the EU because it would
have meant that one in four of the countries around EU tables would have
been Nordic. The Nordic bloc could have wielded considerable influence over
EU decision-making.
The Swedes and Norwegians say the European Economic Area trade pact,
established in 1992 between the European Free Trade Association (Efta) - of
which they are members - and the EU, will protect Norway to a certain extent
once Sweden becomes a full EU member from January 1. But Norwegians concede
that foreigners considering investment in the Nordic region will favour
Sweden because of its EU member status.
The irony of Norway's rejection of membership is that the country will
become more dependent on Sweden to air Norwegian views in Brussels, a
dependency which it has fought hard to shed since dismantling the union with
Sweden 90 years ago.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (4): Political passions stirred - Sweden
and the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely have political passions been so stirred in Sweden than in the debate
that preceded the referendum vote on Sunday November 13 to join the European
Union. Rarely has the country been so deeply split, geographically,
demographically and politically on a national issue.
The depth of feeling on the losing side after the 52.2 - 46.9 per cent
result in favour of membership - 0.9 per cent of voters cast blank ballots -
was graphically illustrated the following day in a radio confrontation
between Mr Carl Bildt, the pro-EU former prime minister, and Mr Per Gahrton,
Environment Party member of parliament and one of the leading figures in the
No campaign.
Mr Gahrton, asked if it was now time quietly to accept defeat, exploded into
a tirade against what he called 'the insults and idiotic arguments' the Yes
side 'spewed over us'. Turning on Mr Bildt, he declared: 'I represent more
kommunes (municipal districts) in this country than you. I represent more
workers than you. I represent many more of the people who will be losers out
of this.'
At least on two points, Mr Gahrton was right. The map of Sweden the morning
after the EU vote showed that the vast majority - geographically - of the
country had voted No, with the Yes vote being carried thanks only to heavy
Yes results in the areas around the three main cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg
and Malmo. Out of 263 kommunes nationwide, only 83 voted Yes.
On the No side, the main stalwart groups were trade unionists, young people
and women. Most worryingly for the newly-formed Social Democratic
government, almost half of all Social Democratic supporters voted No.
The core of the No argument was the perception that membership would
undermine Sweden's independence, compromise its military neutrality,
threaten its cherished welfare system and entrench high unemployment because
of the EU's preference for free-market economics. The Yes campaign,
meanwhile, spearheaded by the political elite and business leaders, argued
that Sweden must be a full participant in the EU's evolving political and
economic structures to cement its own strategic and economic future. The key
question now is whether the deep divisions which the debate exposed will
persist or whether, over time, a general acceptance of the nation's
participation in the EU will grow.
Some signs already suggest the latter. A poll late last month showed most No
voters were reconciled to the Yes result - notwithstanding the reaction of
senior No campaigners such as Mr Gahrton.
In the most northern county of Norrbotten, where some districts voted 80 per
cent against membership, Mr Sven Persson, a senior official in the county
council, commented: 'Many people up here already regard Stockholm rule as
almost colonial rule. Now they see power moving even further away to
Brussels. I think the day when we start to realise the benefits of EU
regional funds for us, people will change their ideas - but it will take
some years.'
Still, there exists at least a risk that the strength of anti-EU feeling at
large in Sweden will make the country forever an inherently Euro-sceptical
EU member. Some No campaigners are already demanding another referendum if
the EU goes further in its move towards common security policies and full
monetary union.
This is particularly true within the Social Democratic party, easily
Sweden's biggest political movement. Walter Karpi, a professor of politics
at Stockholm University, thinks the party faces a tough future over Europe.
'Once a party develops a serious split like this it is very difficult to
overcome it,' he says. 'If the benefits promised by the Yes side - such as
lower unemployment - are not forthcoming then there are likely to be
long-term consequences (within the party).'
However the very threat of such a long-term cleavage undoubtedly increases
the incentive for Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, and his government
to play an active role within the EU in the hope of gaining tangible results
on the issues of most concern to them.
Swedish officials stress their wish - in league with their fellow Nordic
countries Denmark and Finland - to further the campaign for greater openness
in the EU's decision-making processes, to increase environmental standards,
to advance equality between the sexes, to accelerate the integration of
eastern and central European nations (including the three Baltic states), to
cement free trade agreements and, above all, to combat unemployment.
The rejection of membership by Norway has weakened the potential 'Nordic
bloc' within the EU which would have been united in championing these issues
 -a matter of real regret in Stockholm. But Swedish ministers say they will
actively seek to build alliances with other like-minded EU members to form
influential fronts on these issues.
Mr Mats Hellstrom, minister for European affairs, says it is a big mistake
to think that because the anti-EU camp was so strong in Sweden that
Stockholm will not be a full-hearted member. 'That view misunderstands
Sweden,' he says. 'When we enter an international organisation, it is always
our intention to see that the organisation is strengthened, not watered
down.'
But he stresses there is no pre-ordained Swedish position on how the EU's
structures should be shaped. The government, approaching the 1996
Intergovernmental Conference that will review the Maastricht Treaty, is
being cautious. It is sticking by Swedish neutrality, reluctant to be drawn
into taking a stance on a common EU security and defence policy whose shape
is as yet far from clear. Likewise, Stockholm favours extending co-operation
on economic and monetary policy, but is holding back from endorsing a single
currency.
'We will ask how the Union can be effective in creating common policies to
further progress in areas such as environmental and employment policy - then
we will ask to what extent the institutions affect these. Our approach will
be from the substance of politics, not from an ivory tower discussion about
institutions,' says Mr Hellstrom.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (7): The pace needs to quicken
 -The economy minister answers his critics, in an interview with Anthony
Robinson / Restructuring and employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an economist, Mr Karel Dyba, minister of the economy and an old friend of
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, likes tackling questions such as 'Is it
possible to restructure a socialist economy without either large-scale
bankruptcies or heavy unemployment?'
For most of the post-communist states, plagued with double- digit
unemployment and idle factories, the answer has proved negative. But the
Czechs, partly through good fortune but mainly through astute political and
economic footwork, appear to have pulled off the trick.
Sceptics argue that Czech full employment is largely an illusion, with
government-enforced low pay allowing enterprises to keep under-employed
workers on the payroll rather than unemployment lines.
Alternatively they claim that Czechs have low unemployment because they have
hardly started the painful micro-economic surgery on former state-owned
enterprises which has led to mass lay-offs in seriously reforming states
such as Poland or Hungary. Bankruptcies to date have been few and far
between and mainly limited to small companies.
Mr Dyba has little time for such criticism. Without changes at the
enterprise level, it is impossible to sustain macro-economic stability, he
argues. 'Our experience shows that speed is better than searching for
perfection. We have moved from zero to 80 per cent share of privately-owned
enterprises in five years. But this has been accompanied by dramatic
structural changes.
'Employment in the farm sector, for example, has fallen by 50 per cent. The
fastest growth has been in the service sector, especially tourism and
financial services.'
Countering accusations of slow change in the formerly bloated state-owned
industrial enterprises - artificially biased towards heavy industry and the
Soviet market, he reels off the manpower reductions in the largest five
state-owned enterprises.
'The biggest employer of all, the Czech railways, shed 30 per cent of its
former 165,000 workers between 1990-93. Skoda Pilzen, the biggest
engineering conglomerate, lost 43 per cent, the OKD coal mines shed nearly
half their workforce, the Vitkovice steel plant lost a further 28 per cent
and the telephone monopoly SPT shed 13 per cent,' he says.
But Mr Gabriel Eichler, chief financial officer of CEZ, the electricity
corporation, which has slimmed its workforce from 16,000 to 12,000 in three
years, says that with wages so low the real improvements in efficiency have
come elsewhere. 'At CEZ labour represents only 2.6 per cent of total costs.
In our case, the real improvement has come through a 500 basis points
reduction in our average borrowing costs through tighter financial
management.'
Few companies are as capital-intensive as CEZ. The general pattern has been
for loss-makers to be slimmed down rather than closed. Few workers have been
sacked. Most have just walked away from low-paid, boring jobs and found new
employment in the booming construction, hotel and catering, retail and
distribution, banking, tourism and other sectors. A growing number have
become self-employed or work for the fast-growing private start-up
companies.
The Czechs are slower, more cautious and less entrepreneurial than the
Poles, who have taken to capitalism like a duck to water. But the country
now boasts a growing number of private companies and entrepreneurial
business types.
The rate of job creation in the private sector is such that labour shortages
and rapid labour turnover are now a growing concern. Mr Jan Havelka, head of
Czechinvest, the government's inward investment promotion agency, says that
one in five Czechs changed his or her job last year. As a result the Prague
region, where 60 per cent of the GDP is produced, has turned into a magnet
for foreign workers, especially Ukrainians, Serbs and other escapees from
the Yugoslav imbroglio.
The real question for Czech economic managers is not how to preserve
employment and social peace but how to speed up the liquidation of hopeless
enterprises so as to free labour for more productive use in sectors now
facing skill shortages.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (5): Activist funds are in
charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Critics of Czech voucher privatisation feared that managers, freed of state
control, would answer to no one but themselves. Some activist investment
funds have shown that is not necessarily the case, writes Nicholas Denton.
Creditanstalt Investment Company, a subsidiary of the Austrian bank, has
seats on the management boards of about 30 of the 70 companies in which it
holds shares. When it was unhappy with the managing director of a hotel and
spa company in Marienbad, it gathered the support of two other funds and
brought in a younger man. The Harvard Group, run by Mr Victor Kozeny, the
controversial entrepreneur who thought up the first fund, even succeeded in
changing the chairman of Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank.
Shareholder activism has its sunnier side, too. Creditanstalt and fellow
institutional shareholders gave the management of a Moravian brewery a 10
per cent stake on easy terms.
If none of this works, the institutions have a final resort. 'If we like a
company but not the management we seek other funds; if they don't agree to
changes we sell,' says Mr Nigel Williams, chairman of Creditanstalt
Investment Company.
Managers are aware that the funds control their fate. Corus, a
Czech-American investment company, manages a holding in a Moravian brewery.
Mr Harvey Schuster, its chairman, says: 'When the manager comes to Prague,
he's a bit jumpy. He wants to make sure we're friends.'
Yet Mr Schuster reckons that Czech managers, after four years of capitalism,
pay more attention to shareholders than their US counterparts. 'They are
sometimes too sensitive,' he says. 'When someone says he owns 20 per cent of
the shares, the manager still thinks he is like a commissar or from the
ministry.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (4): Czech sell-off broader
than it is deep - While official declarations talk of the success of the
privatisation programme, a number of problems remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The official rhetoric is triumphant. Privatisation in the Czech Republic is
complete, victory declared. A programme of mass asset sales for vouchers
covers 1,500 companies. According to the government, once shares from the
second and final wave of sales for vouchers are distributed in February, 80
per cent of the economy will be in private hands.
But while Czech privatisation has been broad, a question remains over how
deep.
Privatisation has broken the umbilical cord between the state and
enterprises. Managers are now to a large extent free of governmental
interference.
Fears that mass distribution of shares would leave owners, each with a tiny
fragment, impotent have proved unfounded. About two thirds of Czechs
participating in the mass privatisation scheme entrusted their vouchers to
special investment funds. These can take stakes of up to 20 per cent in
individual companies.
In the second wave of mass privatisation alone, 349 funds and about 2m
individuals bid for shares, but the 15 largest institutions picked up 40 per
cent of what was on offer leaving share ownership more concentrated than in
the UK or US.
But while managers have proved surprisingly responsive to their new owners
the funds themselves seem unsure of what to do with their sudden power. The
few western-controlled funds behave like their western counterparts, but
most are passive. Attempts to revamp management often run into opposition
from the largest domestic funds. ZB-Trust, a subsidiary of a German-Czech
bank, says it initiated shake-ups but could never gather sufficient support
from other shareholders.
Institutional investors in the UK or US, while rarely forcing management
changes, do drop the shares of companies with which they are unhappy. The
large Czech funds do not. 'The majority of funds are very bureaucratic,'
says Mr Tibor Nemes, director of the capital markets department of Ceska
Sporitelna. ''Call me in a week after our investment committee meets and
then we can decide,' they say.'
Lack of experience is part of the problem. Mr Nemes talks dismissively of
'so-called fund managers' and says: 'They are not fund managers, they have
no experience.'
Another explanation is that fund managers are not primarily interested in
pleasing their investors. The fee structure for Czech fund managers
encourages them to increase the worth of the holdings they control, but not
necessarily the return to shareholders. Standard fees are 2 per cent of net
asset value a year.
But there are many other ways of making fund management pay. At one extreme
are the fraudsters that use their control to enrich themselves with little
regard for shareholders. But some respectable fund managers also charge
obscure 'management fees'.
A more serious concern is that three of the top four fund managers are
subsidiaries of state-influenced Czech banks. 'You take a company controlled
by government and you sell to a bunch of funds controlled by banks
controlled by government,' says Mr Harvey Schuster of Corus, a
Czech-American fund.
Government and banks deny that commands pass down this chain. But the banks'
dual roles of lender and owner, through their funds, are confused, although
they maintain that Chinese walls divide the parent company and its fund
management subsidiary.
Mr Alex Angell of brokers Wood &amp; Co suggests a conflict of interest exists.
'Large banks' funds have been using their influence to maintain banking
links with the parent company,' he says. Bank funds may also be reluctant to
file for bankruptcy and force a write-off on to the lending arm. Banks have
brokerage as well as fund management subsidiaries. The temptation is to milk
the fund management unit through excessive brokerage fees.
However, none of this detracts from the broad success of the Czech
Republic's mass privatisation. Abuses by fund managers occur in countries
with far longer traditions of stockmarket capitalism.
There is, moreover, a tradition of compromise in Czech business life. The
passivity of the voucher funds may reflect that as much as encourage it.
'Czechs are much more likely to sit round a table than to pull the trigger,'
says Mr Daniel Arbess, a partner at lawyers White &amp; Case.
The Czech economy is still evolving. The dominance of funds may be a
transitory phase. Already some western investors have bought them out in
order to take control of Czech companies. Welsh Water's acquisition of a
Czech water utility is a good example. Shares in SPT Telecom, the telecoms
utility, are due to be distributed only next February in the second wave but
New York hedge funds and Swiss private investors have already engaged in
futures contracts to buy shares allocated to privatisation funds.
It becomes harder to cast voucher privatisation as a mere restructuring of
public ownership. Banks, the owners of fund managers, are moving into
private ownership as they make rights issues to build up their capital base.
Fund managers are themselves improving under the discipline of the market.
ZB-Trust is the best regarded of the Czech bank funds. 'We want to be a
professional investment company. Not just for voucher privatisation. We want
to be good because we plan products in the future and we want to build up a
track record,' says Mr Ales Barabas, member of the board of parent
Zivnotenska Banka.
The ultimate market discipline for fund managers is the threat of takeover.
'They are like any manager of any business; if it can be taken over they are
going to care more,' says Mr Richard Wood, managing director of Wood &amp; Co.
The threat is there. Funds are worth less than the sum of their parts. Out
of 18 funds followed by Wood &amp; Co, 11 trade at discounts of more than a half
to net asset value. Wood &amp; Co is trying to identify a small fund and help
take it over for a demonstration effect that would revalue investments in
all funds. 'That would be a theatrical event,' says Mr Wood. 'Once people
see that it can happen discounts would decrease dramatically.'
Some fund managers have foreseen takeover bids, however. The Harvard fund
management group - run by controversial entrepreneur, Victor Kozeny - has
instituted a 'poison pill' arrangement that makes it all but impossible to
seize its funds. The Czechs have adopted the tricks of capitalism as well as
its nobler principles.

Excitement over the Czech Republic's telecoms privatisation is reaching a
peak. Rival telecoms executives from the US and Europe - and their
investment bankers - trip over each other in hotel lobbies. In the breakfast
rooms they confer in hushed voices to ensure they will not be overheard.
Ten companies remain in the running for the 27 per cent stake on offer in
SPT Telecom. Three consortia have emerged: one, already announced, grouping
Bell Atlantic of the US and France Telecom; another pairing Ameritech,
another US regional operator, with Deutsche Telekom of Germany; and a third
led by KPN of the Netherlands and including AT&amp;T of the US and Swiss
Telecom. Telecom Denmark, Southwestern Bell and Italy's Stet are still
casting around for partners.
'I've never been on a deal where I've met so much bidder interest,' says
Michele Goffin, a vice-president of JP Morgan, advisers to the government.
She describes how bidders argued about how many people could go into the
'data room' to look through SPT documents for the specified 12 hours. 'It
was incredible to watch them cram 14 people into a room.'
Financial investors, too, are buying into SPT Telecom, even ahead of
privatisation. In the second wave of the Czech Republic's voucher programme,
26 per cent of the company has been allocated to individuals and voucher
funds. These shares will be distributed early next year. Already, however,
western hedge funds and private investors are engaging in contracts with
Czech institutions to take future delivery of stock. This market has set a
price of about Kc3,500 a share.
The intensity of interest puts Czech officials in a strong bargaining
position. 'We are not begging investors to come,' says Jiri Makovec,
chairman of SPT. 'We are just telling them that this is an opportunity.' The
sale is likely to raise more than Dollars 1bn, making it the biggest
transaction yet in eastern Europe.
Such fierce competition reflects the fact that for western operators the
sale is a rare opening. 'The opportunity to buy into and influence an
emerging markets telecoms company is disappearing. This is the biggest play
around at the moment,' says a western investment banker.
The Latin American telecom deals are largely completed and west European
privatisations are generally taking the form of public offerings. Thirty per
cent of Hungary's telecoms company Matav has been sold to Deutsche Telekom
and Ameritech; Poland still appears uncertain about how to conduct its
telecom privatisation. 'The timing for the Czechs has been impeccable,' says
Ms Goffin.
SPT Telecom has its own special attractions. The Czech Republic is home to
eastern Europe's most successful economy and must carry SPT with it.
'Telecoms has to do well because otherwise they won't turn around their
industrial society,' says Harvey Schuster, chairman of Corus, a Czech
voucher fund that has invested heavily in SPT.
Investors believe the company is well managed. Operating profit in 1993 was
Kc6.5bn (Dollars 230m). The company has little debt and will have still
less: the winning western consortium will take its 27 per cent stake through
a capital increase. The Czech budget is in rough balance; so all the
proceeds will go to SPT, none to the government.
The concern of investors is an unusual one: SPT's gearing is too low rather
than too high. 'They won't have to borrow a cent for two to three years,'
says one adviser.
Even the company's failings have silver linings. Line density at 20 per 100
inhabitants is low by western standards. Waiting lists are still high at
600,000. But frustrated demand offers the potential for rapid revenue
growth. Labour turnover is high at about 20 per cent per annum. This leads
to rising salaries but it also makes cutting back the labour force easier.
One problem is the Czech Republic's distorted phone tariff structure.
International calls are among the most expensive in Europe while local calls
are the cheapest at about US5c for unlimited time. The government is
unwilling to raise charges sharply ahead of elections in 1996.
The group most likely to win will be the one which can promise the most
rapid development. The target is to double the number of lines by the year
2000 at a cost of about Kc130bn. Only large-scale investment will ease
widespread criticism of the telecoms company. 'We are public enemy number
one,' says Mr Makovec of SPT. 'No other company is so unpopular.'
Attacks come not only from the general public. SPT's international switch is
overloaded and businesses are stepping up their criticism. 'Lines are
getting worse. They've hooked up so many that you can't get through,' says
Andrew Reicher, outgoing general director of investment bank CS First Boston
in Prague.
France Telecom cites its experience in transforming a backward telephone
network to one of the world's most modern in the space of a decade. But most
of the companies competing are technically up to the task. Stet will have to
bear Italy's often unjustified reputation for broken lines but it is likely
to compensate for that by bidding high.
Bell Atlantic, France Telecom and KPN all have the advantage of longstanding
links with SPT. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom suffer the handicap of
state ownership. Deutche Telekom and Ameritech will find it difficult to
promise the Czech Republic any role as a regional hub for telecommunications
traffic after having done so already in Hungary.
But the deciding factor may be nationality. The Czech government's view of
French state companies has been soured by Air France's unsuccessful
investment in CSA, the Czechoslovak airline.
A leading role for Deutsche Telekom would reinforce Germany's economic
influence, already uncomfortably large, over a country it occupied in the
second world war.
Moreover, a sale to a state-owned company would hardly be the privatisation
in which the Czech government believes so strongly. France Telecom and
Deutsche Telekom are addressing these concerns. Each led its respective
consortium in Hungary. In the Czech Republic they are taking a back seat to
their US partners.
Whichever western consortium comes out on top, SPT and the Czech Republic
are bound to be winners. All the conditions are present for a bidding war.
'It is going to take a billion dollars or more to walk away with it,' says
an adviser.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (2): Battle to restore prosperity - Hugh
Carnegy examines the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three issues have dominated what has sometimes been an anguished public
debate about the Swedish economy this year: the budget deficit, the
consequent expansion of the state debt and unprecedented levels of
unemployment.
The deficit, expected to reach SKr201bn in the current July-June fiscal
year, is running at about 13 per cent of gross national product, one of the
deepest holes in the public finances of any European country. Borrowing to
fill the hole has pushed up state debt to almost 90 per cent of GNP, making
Sweden the world's biggest sovereign issuer on international bond markets.
This alarming imbalance, the legacy of a three-year recession and an
overweighted public sector, has to a significant degree been exacerbated by
the need to pay for record unemployment, now running at about 13 per cent of
the workforce when those in government-funded training schemes are added to
the 8 per cent of workers on unemployment benefit.
These are the figures which attracted most attention in the campaign for the
general election in September. The precarious state of the public finances
has also led to strong pressure from the financial markets for drastic
measures to curb borrowing, which in turn has put added strain on the
economy in the form of high long-term interest rates; Sweden pays a premium
of 3.5 percentage points in interest on its 10-year bonds compared with
benchmark German rates.
For Mr Goran Persson, the new Social Democratic finance minister, the tough
task is to forge a transformation from a vicious to a virtuous circle where
the deficit is reduced sufficiently to reassure the markets - thereby
engineering a cut in interest rates which bolsters a real recovery underway
in the economy at large and helps achieve the vital political priority of
cutting unemployment.
But even achieving this may not be enough to produce a long-term solution to
the underlying structural weakness in the Swedish economy that has seen
almost all net job creation in the past two decades come from the public
sector as Sweden's famous universal welfare model expanded. Mr Persson must
also engineer a reversal of a trend that has seen Sweden slide since 1970
from third place in the world league of GNP a head - then behind only the US
and Switzerland - to 16th place.
On the immediate task of sorting out the public finances, the new government
has begun to get down to business. To stabilise the debt by the next
election in 1998 at the latest, the target set by all mainstream political
parties, Mr Persson's team at the finance ministry calculates that the
budget must be strengthened by SKr93bn.
In early November, the first step was taken by a package that included tax
increases to yield SKr31.6bn and spending cuts of SKr25.5bn. A further
SKr20bn in spending cuts is promised in the January budget. With an
estimated saving of SKr14bn forecast for the period from lower interest
rates, this will yield a little over SKr91bn.
Although in a minority in parliament, the Social Democrats have support from
the Left party for the initial package and is confident of securing a
majority with the help of right-of-centre parties for the next budget.
The markets have yet to be convinced. They will need to be reassured that
the Social Democrats can get approval for budget cuts which will hit the
party's bedrock supporters in the welfare system. They are nervous about the
costs of an employment package also promised in the budget which is likely
at least to include some significant short-term spending. They are also
worried that some of the finance ministry's forecasts are over-optimistic.
The ministry is anticipating 3.4 per cent GNP growth in 1995. (This year,
growth is expected to be about 2.5 per cent after three successive years of
recession.) It foresees stable private consumption despite the reduction in
household income due from the tax increases and spending cuts, and a fall in
'open' unemployment to below 7 per cent. It also foresees inflation at 3 per
cent, just on the upper target limit set by the Riksbank.
Almost all other independent forecasts take a more cautious view. A central
concern is that the hoped-for return to growth in the domestic economy will
be dependent on a significant fall in the household savings rate, presently
standing at more than 8 per cent of earnings, which is regarded as being far
from certain.
Mr Pagrotsky acknowledges that if the economy does not perform as well as
anticipated, the budget calculations will be skewed. But he says exports,
which have fuelled the return to growth this year, will continue to grow
well in 1995 and will have a growing trickle-down effect into the domestic
economy as home-based suppliers of exporters benefit. Corporate investment,
long in recession, has finally begun to grow significantly. He also believes
households are becoming less savings-minded as unemployment stabilises.
If the government does succeed in bringing the public finances under
control, the economic debate is likely to shift to the deeper question of
the underlying structure of the Swedish economy. Public sector spending has
grown to account for some 70 per cent of GNP - easily the highest level
among industrialised countries. This will fall as the deficit is reduced -
but to get back closer to average European levels would require a further
stage of reform of the public sector.
To achieve this, the previous government under Mr Carl Bildt, radical leader
of the conservative Moderate party, advocated free market reforms to cut
back state monopolies in the public services, widespread liberalisation in
areas such as labour market regulation, lower taxation on capital and
extensive privatisation.
The Social Democrats, creators of the welfare state, have a different
agenda. They readily accept the need to engender greater private sector
growth; they acknowledge that the public sector must be reduced as a
proportion of the economy; they embrace the need for open markets and
competition.
But they remain committed to a strong public welfare system and the
maintainance of a society where variations in income are smoothed out by
state-directed redistribution of wealth. Their critics say this ultimately
prevents them from tackling issues such as labour and monopoly market
deregulation which is needed to unleash long-term growth.
The government has so far put a break on deregulation of Sweden's energy
market, reversed some Bildt labour reforms and is hesitating over the
privatisation of Telia, the state telecommunications company. The former
government parties may tacitly or even explicitly support the Social
Democrats in their efforts to cut the budget deficit. But they will
certainly keep up the pressure on the new government to go further in
reforming the economy in the battle to restore Sweden's long-term
prosperity.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (3): Two notable triumphs - Interview:
Ingvar Carlsson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ingvar Carlsson, 60, took over as prime minister and leader of the Social
Democratic party in early 1986 after the assassination of his predecessor,
Mr Olof Palme.
In 1991, as Sweden spun towards a deep recession, he lost power to Mr Carl
Bildt, leader of the conservative Moderate party, who declared that the long
dominance of the Social Democrats and the universal welfare state they had
built was over.
But Mr Carlsson led his party back to power in September's general election,
pledged to defend the welfare model. Less than two months later, Mr Carlsson
chalked up a second notable triumph when he won the battle to persuade
Swedes to accept membership of the European Union in a national referendum.
With these victories behind him, Mr Carlsson can now turn to the urgent task
of tackling Sweden's mounting state debt - soon to exceed 90 per cent of
gross national product - and bringing down unemployment presently running at
13 per cent of the workforce.
Hugh Carnegy asked Mr Carlsson to outline his government's primary
objectives:
Mr Carlsson: Very clearly to stabilise the total debt, get over the economic
crisis and stimulate economic growth and get down unemployment.
Doesn't this amount to a rather defensive agenda?
I don't think so. Unemployment in Europe is too high and to say that we want
to attack that unemployment and do it now together with other member
countries in the Union - that is not defensive. It is very important long
term for a progressive society to solve these problems.
The financial markets are sceptical that you can balance your commitment to
defend the welfare system with the need to cut the budget deficit. How can
that be done?
Let us now see what we are doing. First, the former government reduced the
budget deficit by SKr18bn. In addition to that we have now a proposal in
parliament reducing the deficit by another SKr57bn and we have proposed to
parliament the financing of the fee for EU membership of SKrI8bn. And we
have said in January there will be around SKr20bn, mainly in cuts. Honestly
I don't think that the market is aware yet of what we are doing. But they
will see the facts. This means we will stabilise the total Swedish debt
before 1998 - which was what we said in the election campaign. I think it is
possible already in 1997. And when the market sees the total effect of these
proposals that will definitely mean a stronger currency for Sweden and also
a lower rate of interest.
The Social Democrats are in a minority in parliament. How stable is the
government?
We have 46 per cent of the mandates and there are six parties in parliament
 -all the way from the conservatives over to the Left and the Environment
parties. When we look at our proposals we usually find at least one, and
very often several, of the parties supporting us. We are as secure as a
formal minority government could be. I think we have very good chances (to
survive the four-year mandate period).
What role will Sweden play in the EU?
We will be very ambitious. We will be active. We will take responsibility.
We will accept decisions taken and follow them, but we will also come with
concrete proposals, particularly to fight unemployment in Europe and to
fight environmental problems. We will be active supporting the three Baltic
states becoming members. And of course, now Norway is not coming in we will
try to see to it that Norway still will be in close and good co-operation
with the EU.
What action will you propose that the EU should take on unemployment?
I think what is in the EU Commission's Employment White Paper on investment
is a good start - investments in infrastructure, roads, railroads; plus
better labour market policies.
I think Sweden has something to contribute here with our experience on
active labour market policies. Instead of paying cash to people, put it into
active measures. We should have much more on education. Not just for youth
and universities, but recurrent education, bringing people back from the
factories into education, giving them a better chance in languages,
electronics, information technology and all that.
Sweden is a neutral country. After the end of the cold war, some Swedes
argue that neutrality is dead - that joining the EU means Sweden will
inevitably shift towards joining a western European security alliance.
No. I don't agree with that. The parliament has said - and all parties agree
with that - that we are militarily non-aligned, able to be neutral in case
of war in our neighbourhood. And that's a reality. It's a parliamentary
decision and the government is sticking to that.
We are not leaving our present position without knowing where to go. The
Western European Union as it looks today, with the resources it has today,
is no alternative. I think it is not in the interests of Nato, it is not in
the interests of Sweden to change the basic security policy in northern
Europe. We have had a very stable situation in northern Europe for many
years with the kind of security policy we have had so far and I think it
could be a dangerous policy to give Russia the feeling that we are
encircling them.
Of course, we also have to say that with the Berlin Wall torn down in 1989
we have a completely new security position in Sweden. The old, very
difficult policy for us between east and west - that's gone.
We are in former Yugoslavia with more than 2,000 soldiers; we are actively
taking part. So it is a different situation. But when you come to the core -
are we prepared to give up the military non-alignment - the answer is no.
What is Sweden's attitude towards building European Monetary Union?
I am personally in favour of stronger co-operation in monetary policy but
the formal position of Sweden, both the present government and the former
government, is that before saying yes to that co-operation we must know what
it really will mean in reality and we don't know that yet. That is also what
Germany has said: but I see personally that there are good arguments for
increased co-operation. But I don't want to take specific positions. There
are problems with (creating a common currency). I think we have to increase
co-operation but the ways and means to do it have to be discussed further.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (3): Reserves grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relatively high interest rates and the prospect of Koruna revaluation in the
event of full convertibility keep foreign funds flowing in. Every day for
the past few months, the CNB has been buying foreign currency at the regular
11am forex fixing session, writes Anthony Robinson.
So far this year, it has drained Dollars 3.4bn of liquidity from the
markets, pushing reserves up to Dollars 5.8bn by early December. This is
after repayment ahead of schedule of International Monetary Fund loans
totalling Dollars 1.07bn. Reserves in the banking system as a whole, at
about Dollars 8.3bn, are roughly equivalent to a quarter of the estimated
Dollars 35bn gross domestic product for 1994.
This means that at the end of its second year of independence, the Czech
Republic is essentially free of foreign debt. Psychologically, that is
gratifying, especially after the initial worry prompting the central bank to
borrow abroad to bolster reserves shortly after the January 1993 divorce
from Slovakia.
But the inflows, much of which are speculative, have disturbing implications
for money supply and inflation control. The CNB is struggling to keep
inflation for 1994 within its target of 10 per cent. Mr Josef Tosovsky,
governor of the CNB, warns: 'It will be much harder to reduce inflation to 8
per cent in 1995 against a background of rising economic growth.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (2): Raising efficiency is
vital - Economic prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Czechs have managed better than most to shift from a command to a market
economy while maintaining macro-economic stability through the transitional
recession. The issue for next year and beyond is how far and how fast the
owners and managers of the newly privatised enterprises and start-up
companies can raise efficiency against a backdrop of resumed economic growth
and rising foreign reserves and investment.
The government likes to boast that 80 per cent of the economy will be in
private hands once the second round of mass privatisation is concluded early
next year. It exaggerates. The state retains majority stakes through the
national property funds in what socialists used to call 'the commanding
heights of the economy' - energy, steel, telecommunications and the like.
What is more, the still indirectly state-controlled commercial banks
themselves control hundreds of the newly privatised enterprises through
their ownership of most of the top 10 investment funds which have sprung up
over the past three years.
The revamped state-owned banks still control about 80 per cent of banking
business and have received large-scale state aid in order to clear their
balance sheets of inherited bad debts. They still have to prove their
efficiency as risk assessors and capital providers to private business.
The banks insist that they have erected Chinese walls between their banking
and fund management activities. Independent fund managers are not so sure
that the state banks would be willing to take painful bankruptcy decisions,
for example, if the net result was to expose their own bad loans to the
company concerned.
Economic policymakers also face some difficult decisions in the new year if
they are to satisfy demands for clarity on the future tariff structures of
public utilities. Last but not least, the recent inflow of foreign funds
into the country also demands action if the Czech Republic is to maintain
macro-economic stability and progress securely to single-digit inflation as
desired in 1995.
The government and the Czech National Bank have different views on how to
profit from the capital inflows. The CNB would like to see faster progress
towards full convertibility for the Koruna and argues that policy should
concentrate on removing labour, housing and other physical bottlenecks to
faster, investment-led growth.
The government, which means the prime minister himself as the ultimate
decision-maker, is more cautious. With elections due in mid-1996 at the
latest, ministers fear the electoral fall-out from over-hasty moves to raise
utility tariffs or radically reduce the security of tenants in low-cost
apartments.
Construction was the first sector to pick up, with a 20 per cent rebound in
1992 as the new owners of shops and apartments refurbished and modernised
property restored to them as previous owners or bought at auction.
But broader signs of an economic upturn appeared only in May this year,
fuelled by rising industrial and construction activity and a surge in
tourism and other service industries, including banking and finance. Gross
domestic product is expected to expand by 2.5 per cent in 1994, after four
years of declining output and incomes accompanied by far-reaching structural
changes in the economy.
Next year the CNB forecasts GDP growth of 3 to 4 per cent while Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the prime minister, told parliament in early December that the 1995
budget estimates were predicated on a 3.3 per cent rise.
The pace of growth will depend partly on the performance of the German
economy, and partly on how the government decides to use the capital inflows
that are currently being absorbed by the CNB's open market operations and
domestic bond issues.
So far, most of the foreign capital inflows have been in the form of hard
currency credits by overseas banks to Czech enterprises. The loans have been
used to finance the purchase of capital equipment or for working capital, on
terms cheaper than those available from Czech banks.
The inflows are reflected in the Czech Republic's trade statistics, which
show that import growth was much higher than the 13 per cent dollar increase
in exports in 1994, leading to the virtual elimination of last year's trade
surplus. With gross tourist revenues running at more than Dollars 1.5bn over
the first nine months of 1994, the overall current account is expected to
show a surplus of about Dollars 600m in 1994.
But if the government opts for a strategy of investment-led growth next
year, the most likely result would be a substantial trade deficit, although
again the high rate of tourist and other invisible earnings should allow for
a surge in imports without pushing the current account of the balance of
payments into deficit.
The government has agreed to consider higher energy prices from next year,
but the proposed increases, averaging about 12 per cent, have not satisfied
producers. CEZ, the electricity monopoly, says it will lose money on
domestic customers even with the price rises.
A test of the government's attitude to higher utility prices will come when
it formulates a price structure for SPT Telecom, the national
telecommunications company. The state is selling 27 per cent of SPT to a
foreign investor and the new structure will have a crucial bearing on the
price to be paid for the stake. The overall aim is to 'rebalance' prices,
raising domestic call charges while lowering international charges,
currently among the highest in the region. It is a delicate political and
commercial balancing act.
Despite the government's ceaseless free market rhetoric, it remains actively
involved in big strategic investment and privatisation projects such as
Skoda/VW and the choice of strategic partners for SPT and the petrochemical
industry.
Both telecoms and petrochemicals are billion-dollar projects that are
designed to bring key industrial and service sectors up to international
standards.
That task is relatively easy and will follow well-trodden paths. The
principal challenge in 1995 will be to raise the level of managerial skills
and efficiency in thousands of privatised former state enterprises across
the country.
Where the strategic vision has succeeded is in ensuring that this is no
longer a job for the government but for Mr Klaus's army of new shareholders,
investment funds, managers and workers. They now hold the fate of most Czech
enterprises in their own hands. Good corporate governance is the need now
and will decide how the economy as a whole shapes up in preparation for full
membership of the EU early next century.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (1): A watershed decision - The vote to
join the EU now settled, attention will turn again to urgent budgetary
problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY

<TEXT>
This has been a year of rare drama in Sweden.
In the space of two months during the autumn, the country went twice to the
polls. First, in September, the Social Democratic party, led by Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, defied predictions of a few years ago that the creator of Europe's
most all-encompassing welfare system was crumbling. The party returned to
power after three years in opposition when it ousted the right-centre
coalition headed by Mr Carl Bildt in a general election.
Then, in a national referendum in November that provoked much fire and
feeling, the electorate voted by a majority of 52.2 per cent to 46.9 per
cent to join the European Union, a decision which marked the most
significant strategic step by neutral Sweden since the second world war.
An essential part of the debate in both the election and referendum
campaigns was the state of the economy, which had injected its own sense of
drama into the nation's affairs. Although a recovery from a three-year
recession at last took hold, the combined effects of the slump and the costs
of the country's big public sector left the state with a yawning budget
deficit, the fastest-growing debt in the industrialised world and more than
13 per cent of the workforce unemployed.
Beyond the political arena, there were other dramas which stirred the
country to an unusual degree. In the summer - the warmest and sunniest since
records began - Swedes basked in the glory of the national soccer team's
unexpected advance to third place in the World Cup, becoming the
competition's top-scoring team in the process.
But just after the election in September, the nation was plunged into a
state of shocked mourning by the sinking of the Estonia, the Baltic ferry
which foundered in a storm taking to their deaths more than 900 passengers
and crew - most of them Swedish. The disaster was unprecedented in modern
Swedish history, striking communities all over the country much as a war
might do.
Other events rarely experienced in Sweden have contributed to an unusual
sense of insecurity. In June, a young soldier shot dead seven people in a
crazed shooting spree in the central town of Falun. In November, a teenager
was beaten to death by two schoolmates. This month, four people were killed
when a gunman opened fire on a crowd leaving a Stockholm night club.
The combination of these different events has reinforced the concern of the
Social Democrats, in power for more than 50 of the past 60 years, to restore
a sense of equilibrium to the country.
The party's instincts are clearly to rely on its traditional emphasis on
creating a unified, egalitarian society underpinned by the universal welfare
system. It regarded the 45 per cent share of the vote it won in the election
 -one of its best recent results - as a clear sign that the electorate had
rejected Mr Bildt's appeal to transform Sweden through radical, free-market
policies.
But the challenge Mr Carlsson faces is to reconcile the defence of a welfare
system with the cuts and reforms he readily acknowledges are required to
sort out the public finances and return the economy to stable, long-term
growth that will reduce unemployment. Mr Carlsson's immediate priority is,
without doubt, the state of the public finances. This crisis struck,
ironically, just as the economy was pulling out of recession.  An export
boom, fuelled by the devaluation of the Swedish krona in late 1992 and the
recovery in international markets, has delivered economic growth this year
of about 2.5 per cent after three successive years of recession which shrank
the economy by 5 per cent.
This year, Sweden's big international companies such as Volvo, Ericsson,
Electrolux and the big forestry-sector operators have surged back to high
profitability on the back of the boom. Exports are set to continue to grow
well in 1995 and there are hopes of a modest recovery in the domestic
economy as well, leading the government to forecast gross national product
growth next year of 3.4 per cent.
But unless the budget deficit is quickly brought under control and borrowing
is stabilised, there are fears that continued high interest rates could
precipitate a 'double dip' return to recession.
Mr Carlsson and Mr Goran Persson, his finance minister, have therefore set a
deadline for stopping the growth of the state debt - presently about 90 per
cent of GNP - by 1998 at the latest through a series of tax increases and
spending cuts. The budget deficit in the present fiscal year is forecast at
SKr201bn, or 13 per cent of GNP; the government has already announced a
package of tax rises and savings to reduce the deficit by SKr57bn by 1998
and plans a further SKr20bn cuts in the January budget. The two key
questions are whether this will be sufficient and whether it is politically
sustainable for the minority government. Many in the financial markets are
sceptical that the scale of the spending cuts will be enough in an economy
where public spending has reached 70 per cent as a proportion of GNP. They
fear that the government has made over-optimistic calculations of the
savings it expects from lower interest rates and lower unemployment, based
on expectations of a vigorous recovery. They are far from convinced that the
post-devaluation bounce in the economy will not turn into another damaging
inflationary cycle, as happened in the 1980s.
Ominously for the government, international credit rating agencies are
presently re-assessing Sweden's sovereign credit rating. Moody's, the US
agency, has warned that it may shortly down-grade Sweden. If it does,
interest rates will jump and Mr Persson's budget plans will be put under
even stronger pressure.
The markets are also watching political developments very carefully. Mr
Carlsson is confident the government can get its policies through the
Riksdag (parliament) by charting a 'slalom' course, seeking support for a
majority on different issues from among the six other parliamentary parties,
which range from the Left and Environment parties on the left, through the
Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats in the centre, to Mr Bildt's
Moderates on the right. 'We are as secure as a formal minority government
could be,' says Mr Carlsson.
His confidence may be rewarded because there is a strong desire among most
parties to see public finances brought back into balance. But Mr Carlsson
and Mr Persson first have to persuade their own party supporters and the
trade unions to accept public sector and benefit cuts on a scale rarely seen
before.
The urgency of the budget battle has tended to overshadow the watershed that
will occur when Sweden joins the EU in January. Throughout the post-war
period, Sweden stood to one side from western Europe, concerned above all to
preserve its neutral stance between the Soviet Union and the US-led western
alliance.
With the end of the cold war, those concerns have largely melted away,
allowing Mr Carlsson to lead his previously anti-EU party towards Brussels.
Sweden - along with neighbouring Finland, but not Norway, which rejected
membership - will now be firmly sited in the western European strategic and
economic camp.
But Stockholm is proceeding cautiously. The government is holding firmly to
military neutrality. It will take up the minimum observer status in the EU's
military organisation, the Western European Union; it has joined Nato's
'Partnership for Peace' initiative, but has no intention of applying for
full Nato membership.
On economic co-operation, Mr Carlsson is being careful to keep his options
open, ahead of the EU's planned 1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty, which
laid out a timetable for European Monetary Union. He says he favours closer
monetary co-operation, but will not be drawn on whether Sweden supports an
eventual move to a unified currency.
With Sweden far from meeting the monetary criteria for Emu, its
participation is something of an academic question, at least until the end
of the decade. But Stockholm will support moves to make employment
conditions part of the Emu criteria - a concern that reflects Mr Carlsson's
anxiety to put the fight against unemployment at the top of the EU's agenda,
alongside the next enlargement project to include central and eastern
European nations.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (1): Towards a state of grace -
A pro-business government has achieved political stability while maintaining
economic growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The inter-war Czechoslovakia which is preserved in sepia photographs and the
still modern buildings of its avant-garde architecture was a prosperous,
bourgeois democracy in the heart of Europe; it was a normal country. The
post-communist Czech Republic, divorced from Slovakia since January 1993, is
well on its way back to that state of grace.
Keeping the new state on the straight and narrow path of recovery is a
pro-business government headed by an abrasive, opinionated, but undoubtedly
clever, man. In style and substance, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister,
far more closely resembles his political idol, Britain's Margaret Thatcher,
than any of his counterparts elsewhere in a central Europe released from
Soviet bondage only five years ago.
Alone among post- communist politicians, Mr Klaus manages to combine clear
and unequivocal public statements about the virtues of hard work, private
enterprise and free markets with a subtle manipulation of the state budget
to ease the pain of transition and keep the electorate on his side.
'The government will not subsidise or bail out bankrupt companies. It is
prepared to act as a catalyst for change or to share in restructuring costs,
but then all involved - the government, creditors and the enterprise itself
 -have to sacrifice something,' says Mr Jiri Waigl, the prime minister's
chief adviser.
Not everyone is impressed. Mr Milos Zeman, who leads the main non-communist
opposition grouping, the social democrats says: 'Klaus was fine for the
first, restrictive phase. His time is over. The problem is that he does not
know it yet.'
But neither, it seems, does an electorate which voted heavily for Mr Klaus
in the June 1992 elections and reconfirmed its support by backing candidates
linked to his party, the Civic Democratic party (ODS), in last month's local
elections. Opinion polls also continue to give him and his party top rating.
Barring accidents, Mr Klaus, a 52-year-old macro-economist, looks well set
for another term in office as head of a coalition government after general
elections scheduled for mid-1996.
The economy is his strong point. As finance minister he masterminded the
economic reform strategy which came into effect in January 1991, a year
after the pioneering 'shock therapy' Polish reform programme. Whereas Poland
faced hyper-inflation and was saddled with a Dollars 42bn foreign debt, Mr
Klaus inherited a decaying but cautiously managed economy with relatively
little debt and stable prices.
While Poland and Hungary became bogged down in complicated, government-
managed privatisation schemes Mr Klaus, contemptuous of the capacity of
governments or bureaucracies to manage enterprises, boldly struck out on a
two-stage mass privatisation programme.
The results have been spectacular. By early next year, around 80 per cent of
the economy will be at least partially privatised. At that point the fate of
the Czech economy will be largely in the hands of enterprises and the
managers and investment funds set up to exercise corporate governance on
behalf of more than 7m small shareholders.
The most painful part of micro-economic readjustment at the enterprise level
is probably about to begin. Hundreds of former state-owned enterprises have
already shed up to half their bloated workforces and disposed of assets. But
few have actually closed or been forced into bankruptcy. The bankruptcy and
related laws are on the statute book, but the courts are inexperienced in
commercial matters and overloaded.
The pace of bankruptcies should rise sharply in the new year, and so,
temporarily, should unemployment. The jobless rate is currently around 3.5
per cent nationally, but far lower in the Prague region where around 60 per
cent of GDP originates. Increasingly, influential policy makers such as Mr
Josef Tosovsky, the central bank governor, argue that without a labour
shake-out from dying companies, the pace of economic recovery risks being
stunted by labour and other shortages.
The difficulty lies in convincing Mr Klaus that the political fall-out will
be less than feared, provided policy makers concentrate on removing
bottlenecks to growth in what is already an expanding economy. This means
difficult decisions in politically sensitive areas, such as raising public
utility tariffs and rents so as to encourage labour mobility by freeing up
the property market.
Mr Klaus has already shown he can be stubborn in such matters. After months
of work by bankers and lawyers, he turned down flat a plan to build a toll
motorway from Heidelberg to Prague when he found that the tolls would have
to be so high that only German motorists could afford them, but not Czechs
on an average monthly wage equivalent to about Dollars 250.
For all the razzmatazz about the market economy, Mr Klaus is acutely aware
that daily life remains a struggle for most of the 10.3mCzechs, while the
fruits of change as yet are being enjoyed by a fairly thin, albeit highly
visible, stratum of society. His delicate political antennae have helped
ensure that, unlike elsewhere in the region, the Czech communist party
stands no chance of returning to power in a new guise. The communists retain
electoral support among the old and those nostalgic for the old social
safety net and easier work practices. But the majority continue to share the
optimism shown by Mr Klaus about the future.
There are blemishes on the record. One is the prime minister's constant
humiliation of President Vaclav Havel, who is in many ways a far more
representative figure of the traditionally tolerant, sceptical, bucolic and
somewhat shambling Bohemian of popular stereotype than the austere, rather
Germanic, Mr Klaus. Another is the Czech approach to the civil rights of an
uncomfortable minority within their ranks - the country's nearly 250,000
gypsies, many of whom were rendered stateless after the divorce from
Slovakia.
Increasingly however, the Czech Republic is being perceived, along with
Poland, as the economic success story of central Europe. Of that region, it
is the most prepared country for entry into the European Union.
Foreign capital has been flowing into the republic in embarrassing amounts.
Reserves have risen virtually to equal the nation's foreign debt. The credit
rating agencies give it investment grade listing, Czech companies and banks
have been welcomed back to international capital markets while the
government is repaying its own loans at a fast clip.
Above all, the economy is expanding again while the budget remains balanced
and inflation is dipping towards single digits. The Czech Republic is closer
to complying with the 'convergence criteria' laid down by the EU Maastricht
summit than most of the EU's current members, and is more politically
stable, too.
Mr Klaus, in an elegant overcoat and carrying a silver-topped cane, looked
at least the equal of his western counterparts at the EU summit in Essen
earlier this month. He has clear views on the future shape of an enlarged
Europe and on the errors of Europe's current policies. Prague did not break
free from Moscow only to fall under the thrall of centralising,
socialistically inclined Brussels, he tells the west. He also blames
excessive social security costs for Europe's high unemployment and loss of
global competitiveness.
Until now, western Europe has liked to view itself as the senior party when
advice was required. The Czech Republic under Mr Klaus has become the most
forcible advocate in former communist Europe of the need for a genuine
dialogue. Both sides will probably benefit from the exchange.

1 1995
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Trade Organisation, the successor to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, is launched. Gatt will continue for a one-year transition
period.
Mercosur: A customs union comprising Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay
is due to come into being. It may develop into the nucleus of a South
American Free Trade Area.
Andean Pact countries, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, enter
into their own free trade agreement.
Japan initiates a partial opening of its rice market, allowing 4 per cent of
consumption to be supplied by imports.
European security: The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE), which comprises all European and Commonwealth of Independent States
countries and the US and Canada, changes its name to Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). This is part of an effort to
upgrade the body into an umbrella organisation for European security.
European Union expands:
Austria, Finland and Sweden join. The Union's territory will grow by a
third, its population by 6 per cent and its GDP by 7 per cent. Norway's
voters rejected membership in a referendum in November.
Austria, being rich, will have to contribute some Sch30bn (Dollars 2.7bn) to
the EU's coffers this year, aggravating a budget deficit of 5 per cent of
GDP. About a third of the money comes back as adjustment payments to farmers
because the Common Agricultural Policy takes immediate effect.
Consumers are the big winners, not only on food prices, but also on many
service costs where protectionist walls must come down. The Austrian
National Bank is joining the European Monetary System immediately and will
probably join the Exchange Rate Mechanism in short order. The schilling is
rigidly pegged to the D-mark, so these moves will have no noticeable effect.
Sweden and Finland, neutral Nordic neighbours who kept their distance from
western Europe during the Cold War, step into the Union hoping membership
will consolidate their recovery from deep recession.
Both will become net contributors to the budget; consumers should benefit
from lower food prices as trade barriers fall, but Finland's highly
subsidised farmers are braced for a painful adjustment to the EU's lower
farm prices. Both countries are signing up for the EMS, but intend to float
their currencies for the time being.
France takes over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union
from Germany against the background of campaigning for domestic presidential
elections due in May.
Free-trade agreements between the EU and the three Baltic republics,
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are due to come into effect. They are a first
step towards eventual accession.
European Medicines Evaluation Agency opens shop in London. A pharmaceuticals
licensing body for medicines marketed in more than one European Union
country, it should streamline drug approvals.
Euro-gobbledygook: Britain's Plain English Campaign, which crusades against
obscure bureaucratic language, has said it will turn its attention to
Brussels-speak. Its Inside Write campaign is to monitor internal
publications.
Germany's second Financial Markets Promotion Act, the legislative mainstay
of a project to bring Finanzplatz Deutschland up to international standards
in areas such as regulation and supervision, comes into force. Centrepiece
is a ban on insider trading with five years' jail as the maximum punishment.
First victims of the legislation have been the traditional 'fireside chats'
 -informal pre-Christmas meetings between management and hand-picked
journalists at which sensitive full-year results data were formerly dished
out as liberally as the beer and sausages.
Cost of unity: German taxpayers face a 7.5 per cent solidarity surcharge on
income tax to help pay for the integration of former East Germany into the
country.
UK employers' liability insurance policies, which provide cover against
workplace deaths and injuries, renewed from today will no longer offer
unlimited cover. Insurance companies have imposed a basic claims limit of
Pounds 10m.
UK commission disclosure: Under a new regime imposed by City regulators,
life insurance and pensions sales agents and advisers will have to give
customers more information about the policies they sell and the costs of
selling them.
Last gasp: Australia extends its anti-smoking provisions. There will be a
ban on advertising smoking materials, except limited point of sale material,
and on the use of brand names for promotional purposes. Packaging must bear
larger health warnings.
The US's Delta Airlines begins a smoking ban on all its flights.
Century of cinema: The cinema has decided to declare 1995 its 100th birthday
in a year-long celebration around the globe. Paris in December 1895 saw the
first audience buy tickets for the first public moving picture show in a
disused ballroom.

MONDAY 19
EU-Turkish customs union
Foreign ministers of the European Union and Turkey meet in Brussels to
discuss establishment of a customs union in 1996. Opposition from Greece and
human rights campaigners will probably force a postponement of a decision
for a couple of months.
Bosnia: Armed forces chiefs from 11 Nato countries concerned in the Bosnian
conflict meet to consider ways of reinforcing the UN mission in former
Yugoslavia. They will be joined by other interested parties, including
Russia and Germany, on Tuesday.
European Union fisheries ministers meet in Brussels to sort out Spanish and
Portuguese entry to Union fishing waters. Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime
minister, will push for integration into the common fisheries policy by
1996, but the French, UK and Irish are worried about the impact on stocks.
BCCI: A settlement for creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International proposed by liquidators Touche Ross goes before a London
court.
Gulf Co-operation Council leaders, meeting in Bahrain, are expected to
review their commitment to double their joint forces in the Gulf.
FT Surveys: Sweden and Czech Republic.
TUESDAY 20
Fed meets on interest rates
Most analysts do not expect the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Markets
Committee to raise short-term rates this side of Christmas, but a half-point
rise to 6 per cent remains a possibility.
China and its main trading partners meet in Geneva to take stock of
Beijing's eight-year-old application to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. Gatt
members will try to persuade Beijing to keep talking past its end-year
deadline for a 'substantive agreement'.
De Beers, which accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in uncut
diamonds, reveals its 1994 sales. After first-half sales of Dollars 2.58bn,
it eased back, so the total is expected to be about the same as last year's
Dollars 4.366bn.
UK parliament rises for the Christmas recess (to Jan 10).
WEDNESDAY 21
Italian politics: The fate of Silvio Berlusconi's embattled right-wing
coalition government will be decided by a confidence debate immediately
after approval of the 1995 budget. Berlusconi will be testing whether all
coalition members, especially the populist Northern League, are willing to
continue his eight-month-old mandate.
THURSDAY 22
Say when on Schengen
Ministers from seven EU states meet in Bonn to decide when the Schengen
free-travel accord should come into force.
Interior ministers from Germany, France, the three Benelux countries, Spain
and Portugal are expected to set March 25 as a date for the abolition of
border controls, although France may request a 6-month transition period.
The Bundesbank central council is to fix 1995 parameters for German money
supply growth as measured by the much-maligned but stoutly-
defended M3 formula. The factors influencing the decision - permissible
inflation levels and potential for economic growth - will also be weighed in
the routine contemplation of interest rates, which some observers persist in
believing may be reduced today.
FRIDAY 23
Romania's left-wing minority government faces its sixth no-confidence vote

economic reforms, which is backed by the International Monetary Fund.
Holidays: Sweden.
SUNDAY 25
Japan's new electoral system takes effect. It replaces the current 511-seat

set up in 1990 to privatise east German industry, ceases operations. With
more than 13,000 enterprises originally on its books, the agency has either
sold off or shut down the region's industry. In all, it raised DM160bn
(Dollars 102bn) from investment guarantees and will save 1.5m of the 3.5m
pre-1990 industrial jobs.

Other economic news
Tuesday: The twice-yearly economic outlook from the Paris-based Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development will give an upbeat view of
economic prospects for the OECD's 25 industrialised member states over the
next two years. Governments will be urged to maintain prudent policies to
secure steady growth with low inflation.
Wednesday: Britain's trade with countries outside the European Union is
expected to show some improvement in November. The City consensus points to
a deficit of Pounds 375m after October's mildly disappointing shortfall of
Pounds 410m.
Thursday: UK third-quarter balance of payments figures will attract more
attention than usual because some analysts believe the fall in the UK
visible trade deficit to a near 10-year low in the three months to
end-September could presage current account equilibrium or surplus.
During the week: German M3 growth is expected to slow further in November.
However, the consensus forecast of 6.4 per cent annualised growth from the
base in last year's final quarter would still be above the 4 per cent to 6
per cent target range.

Trading volumes are likely to be sluggish in the week leading up to
Christmas as dealers indulge in seasonal celebrations.
The economic statistics on offer are unlikely to disturb the festivities;
the broad measure of money supply (M4) and the non-European Union trade
figures rarely move the market, and Thursday's third-quarter GDP figure is
expected to be unchanged from the last estimate.
More significant could be the publication, on Wednesday, of the minutes of
the November 2 meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the
exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. With the
market expecting a further base rate rise in the first quarter of 1995, the
governor's views on inflationary indicators will be closely watched.
Attention will also be focused abroad, and in particular on the US Federal
Reserve's open market committee meeting in Washington tomorrow.
Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks the Fed will not
tighten and the Bundesbank's M3 money supply target will indicate little
need for a further rise in German rates. In such circumstances, and given
her view that a lot of bad news on interest rates is already priced into the
market, she thinks there is scope for short gilts to rally.

There will be an element of nervousness in the bond market tomorrow, as the
Federal Open Market Committee meets to discuss policy.
Although further tightening is on the cards, few expect the Fed to move only
a month after its last unexpectedly sharp increase. But as pessimists point
out, there is still no indication of final demand in the economy slowing
down. Therefore, the longer the Fed leaves it, the more likely it is that
the next rise will be another big one.
The main economic news this week starts tomorrow with the release of
October's trade figures. Wednesday brings the first projections from
corporations of their capital expenditure next year, along with actual
spending in this year's third quarter.
On Thursday comes the final figure for third-quarter GDP growth (presumed to
remain close to the preliminary figure of 3.9 per cent) and the implicit
price deflator, which should be close to 2 per cent. Friday brings November
durable goods orders and personal income and expenditure.
While consumer spending is of vital importance, the November figures
scarcely matter. In the week before Christmas, what matters is what shoppers
are doing. The media say the news for the bond market is not encouraging: US
shoppers are out in force and spending hard.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Bond prices in Tokyo ended the week little changed in a market that has
become directionless as traders await developments. The benchmark 10-year
government bond ended the week at 96.84 yielding 4.595 per cent, compared
with 4.62 per cent a week earlier. On Friday, bonds moved in the opposite
direction to stocks, rising in early trading, then sliding back towards the
close.
The easy credit stance of the Bank of Japan continues to mitigate against
higher interest rates in the near term. By the end of the week, the BoJ had
injected Y1,100bn into the money market, including Y300bn in loans to
commercial banks.
The total, which was on the high side of market expectations, included about
Y190bn in three-month CDs issued at 2.34 per cent, which found a ready
market with short-term fund managers who see little chance of a rate rise.
On Friday, outgoing BoJ governor Mr Yasushi Mieno called for the injection
of sufficient liquidity into the economy for banks to trade the
non-performing loans that are the legacy of the bursting of the 'bubble
economy'.
Mr Mieno also said Japan's current account surplus must be reduced by
correcting the imbalance between savings and investment in Japan. Mr Yasuo
Matsushita, his successor, is expected to tread much the same path.

FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Investors still enjoy positive returns -
Junk bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Junk bonds - corporate debt issued in the US and rated below investment
grade - lost more than 2 per cent of their value in November, according to
figures published last week by Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating
agency.
Noting an increased rate of default and rising yield spreads, Moody's said
the decline was the second largest since the inception of its speculative
grade index in February 1991.
The news will reinforce the views of critics who see dabbling in the Dollars
290bn junk bond market as tantamount to wild and dangerous speculation - but
the market's recent evolution and performance defies this kind of judgment.
Certainly, prices of junk bonds have fallen this year, principally because
of the 2.5 per cent increase in US interest rates and investors'
expectations of higher inflation.
The Moody's index - made up of 553 bonds - fell by 2.28 per cent in November
bringing the cumulative decline for 1993 as a whole to 9.82 per cent.
However price declines have been mitigated by relatively large coupon
payments and tightening credit spreads.
Overall - when the effect of interest payments is included - junk bonds have
offered positive returns of 0.35 per cent over the year to November,
according to Moody's.
Between May and October investors saw six consecutive months of positive
overall returns. 'In this rout for the bond market, returns are still
positive,' says Mr Lea Carty, an economist with Moody's in New York.
Even in November, investors in bonds rated B1 and Ba1 - the upper end of
Moody's speculative grade spectrum equivalent to B plus and BB plus ratings
issued by Standard &amp; Poor's, the other major rating agency - earned positive
total returns - of 0.49 per cent and 0.47 per cent respectively.
Taking a longer-term view, junk bonds have also done surprisingly well. Many
corporate issuers have been performing well as the US economy pulled out of
recession.
In price terms, junk bonds have outperformed US Treasuries, especially since
1992, and spreads over Treasuries tightened sharply in 1993 and 1994.
Moody's B3s (equivalent to S&amp;P's B minus) were trading at 672 basis points
over Treasuries in February 1993, narrowed to 483 basis points over in
February this year and 431 basis points since November, for example.
Moody's Ba1 bonds, the highest rated non-investment grade, traded at a
spread over Treasuries of 306 points in February 1992, falling to 260 points
over a year later and 182 over in February 1994. At the end of last month
Ba1 bonds had narrowed further to 175 points.
The improvement has also been reflected in a gradual decline in the rate of
default. Default rates reached 9.5 per cent in 1991 before falling to 3.1
per cent in 1993. In June 1994, based on Moody's trailing 12-month
issuer-based rate, rates fell to a decade low of 1.44 per cent.
Mr Anton Simon, head of high yield investments at the United Bank of Kuwait
in London, says this year's decline in prices has been less marked than many
would have expected, partially because the market has become both deeper and
more liquid as a result of a change in the profile of investors, following
the entry of bigger institutional investors into the market since 1990.
Some 30 per cent of the high yield market is owned by mutual funds, 25 per
cent by US insurance companies, 12 per cent by US pension funds and 10 per
cent by investment grade and equity investors, with only 3 per cent of the
market owned by foreign investors, according to figures cited by Mr Simon.
'In the past, the high yields would have been clobbered in this kind of
market,' he says. 'People just saw it as dirty asset class - when they felt
nervous they just got rid of it.'
Mr Simon says the level of research and understanding of the market has also
increased and there is growing receptivity among institutions to arguments
that high yield corporate bonds should be treated as a separate asset class.
In a report published earlier this year, Pennsylvania-based SEI Capital
Markets Research noted low levels of correlation in the performance with
either US equities, investment grade bonds or Treasury bonds.
SEI said investors should hold between 10 and 30 per cent of their fixed
income portfolios in high yield bonds. It maintained that a portfolio of
fixed income becomes more efficient when high yield bonds are admitted - the
efficiency stemming from greater return and lower volatility.
SEI added that 'risks can be minimised through diversification among a range
of high yield issues'.
Enthusiasts also point out the importance of carefully monitoring the credit
quality of issuers, with the investment focus much more akin to that taken
by a manager of equity rather than fixed income. 'Never compromise on credit
vigilance,' says Mr Simon.
As signs of an economic slowdown in the US build up, that looks like
essential advice for investors tempted by the potential returns offered by
the sector.

FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Avid Bundesbank watchers will be keeping a close eye on this week's meeting
of the German central bank's council - at which the money supply target for
1995 will be set - to see what clues emerge about monetary policy.
The Bundesbank has made no interest rate changes since May and economists
are divided as to when rates will start heading upwards again.
This year, M3 has soared alarmingly before recently falling back to within
striking distance of the target range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent. The 1995
target is expected to be about the same.
For the moment, the Bundesbank is keeping the markets calm, knowing how
volatile they have been as bond market rates have risen in the wake of US
anti-inflationary moves.
Next year is likely to be a lot calmer for the bond market than 1994 has
been. The 10-year bund yield started the year at 5.55 per cent, its lowest
since 1986, and reached a high of 7.8 per cent in October, from which it has
eased slightly.
Commerzbank expects the 1995 level to average 6.8 per cent, with a similar
level for 1996.
The favourable inflation trend and the easing in M3 provide a stable basis
for the bond market, the bank argues, with domestic investors expected to
become more enthusiastic.

FT  19 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: Uncertainty remains over Nordic bonds -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For investors in the Nordic government bond markets, this has been a year of
uncertainties.
They have had to deal with a general election in Sweden, EU referenda in
Norway, Sweden and Finland, and recovery from recession in all four
countries that has left investors extremely nervous about whether there will
be a new surge in inflation.
What is more, these uncertainties have arisen against a background of a
spectacular deterioration in bond markets worldwide that has had a
particularly severe impact on the Nordic region.
However, the most dominant concern - for investors in the Swedish and
Finnish markets, at least - has been the state of the countries' public
finances.
Uncertainty has revolved around the ability and willingness of the Swedish
authorities, in particular, to bring under control a budget deficit expected
to reach 13 per cent of gross national product in the current year and a
national debt that is now approaching 90 per cent of GNP.
This uncertainty remains. Although yields in Sweden - and in the other
Nordic countries - have fallen since the autumn as a relative calm has
settled on international bond markets generally, Scandinavian investors -
and in Sweden's bond market in particular - remain extremely wary.
The election in September in Sweden ushered in a new government, under
Social Democrat Mr Ingvar Carlsson, which immediately signalled its intent
to be strict on public spending.
That, and Sweden's decision to join the EU, which many think will impose an
anti-inflation discipline on the government, provided a boost for the
Swedish market.
Nevertheless, investors will be watching next month's budget closely for an
indication of how strict the government really intends to be on public
spending - there was a wobble in the bond market last week at talk that
taxes may be raised instead of spending cut.
'It was no big deal (the rumour was that the government would raise a tax on
bank profits instead of cutting public consumption) but the market is very
sensitive to any sign that the government is not keen on cutting spending at
the moment,' said Mr Niels Christensen, Nordic analyst at Technical Data in
London.
Another uncertainty facing Sweden is the possibility that the country's
credit rating may be downgraded.
In October, Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, warned
that the country's Aa2 rating had been put on review for possible downgrade
because of its rising public sector debt. If this happens, it could raise
significantly Sweden's borrowing costs and lead to a jump in yields.
Another, more longer-term risk is inflation. With expected GNP growth of 3.4
per cent in 1995, there are already some signs of significant cost
pressures, with producer prices growing at around 6 per cent.
Inflation is also the main risk to the Danish bond market. The 'economic
fundamentals' look extremely favourable for Denmark - inflation is currently
low at around 2.0 per cent, it has a current account surplus and its
finances are in a healthy state.
Denmark is ahead of most other European countries in the economic cycle and
growth is expected to peak this year, before declining gradually in 1995.
However, although inflation is currently low, some analysts doubt the
authorities' willingness to tighten policy to head off future inflation.
'Unlike the UK, which is at a similar stage in the economic cycle, Denmark
has interest rates on hold and has only begun to gradually reverse the
stimulative fiscal policy it embarked upon in 1993-94,' said Mr Darren
Cullen, Scandinavia economist at Salomon Brothers in London. 'Many are
bullish about Denmark, but until it signals a stronger anti-inflationary
stance I'm not convinced,' he said.
The prospects for Norway's government bond market are perhaps brighter,
although it is the smallest and least liquid of the Scandinavian markets and
the one which has least interest for international investors.
Certainly, its fundamentals - a current account surplus and subdued
inflation - are supportive, and since the decision at the referendum not to
join the EU, there has been a dramatic rally in the Norwegian bond market -
the 10-year yield has now fallen by more than one percentage point since the
peak in September and the yield spread against Germany has narrowed
significantly.
'This reaction to the 'no' vote is perhaps due to the fact that Norway was
likely to be a net contributor to the EU budget so its fiscal position has
been helped by the decision,' said Mr Christensen. He expects the yield
spread against Germany to narrow further next year.
The Finnish bond market has, to a large extent, taken its lead from Sweden
and it shares many of Sweden's problems - a large budget deficit and fears
that inflation could take off with the economy growing strongly.

The Bahamas aims to launch a stock exchange in 1995 with assistance from the
Inter-American Development Bank, Reuter reports.
The IADB said that the long-term intention was to harmonise the existing
four Caribbean stock exchanges, and nine others in Central America. The
Bahamas exchange would join ones already operating in Jamaica, Barbados,
Trinidad and the Dominican Republic.
Some 10 to 12 government enterprises are expected to be privatised in the
coming months in the Bahamas. The former British colony is one of the
world's largest offshore banking centres.

Mr Michael Howell, of Baring Securities, has forecast that the current bear
market will be in retreat by the middle of next year, but warns that
equities worldwide could fall by an additional 10 to 15 per cent over the
next few weeks.
There could be two increases in US rates of 50 basis points a time early in
the new year, but thereafter a slowdown in the growth of the US economy
would underpin sentiment.
He recommends taking an overweight position in southern and eastern Europe,
the Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Lisbon to take global path for rest of
programme - Portuguese privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portugal is preparing to tap international markets with its first global
equity issues as the privatisation programme that has raised more than
Es936bn (Dollars 5.8bn) over the past five years move beyond the capacity of
domestic investors.
A simultaneous offer of 25 per cent of Portugal Telecom in New York, London
and Lisbon next May, raising an expected Es240bn, will be the centrepiece of
several Portuguese equity issues in 1995 that will test the government's
adroitness in approaching international markets.
Global offers of substantial holdings in Cimpor, one of Europe's top 10
cement companies, and Companhia Portuguesa de Producao de Electricidade, a
power production utility, are also in the pipeline. But only the Cimpor
issue is likely to be completed before a general election due in October
1995 at the latest.
The move into international markets is attracting global banks to a
privatisation programme that stimulated little interest when it was limited
to domestic issues. Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, will lead the
global issuing consortium for Portugal Telecom. Morgan Stanley is advising
on the structure of Cimpor's offer.
Sale of a first tranche of 20 per cent of Cimpor in July provided some
important lessons that the Portuguese authorities appear to be assimilating.
Although a domestic issue, Cimpor had hoped to attract strong interest from
overseas. But foreign investors acquired only a disappointing 32 per cent -
although foreign institutions underwrote 47 per cent - in an operation that
raised Es39.61bn.
The most damaging drawback was the fixing of the issue price by government
decree almost two months before the sale. The market dropped 15 per cent in
the interim and investors shied away. The authorities are committed to
eliminating this risk from future offers by setting only a price range by
decree and delegating the exact fixing for a few days before the operation.
Guaranteeing flexibility for the PT issue, Mr Eurico Cabral da Fonseca,
chairman of Comunicacoes Nacionais, the state holding company for the
telecommunications sector, said: 'The global offer will be subject to the
principle of open pricing, giving priority to the level of demand and to
establishing an equilibrium price as a trading reference for secondary
markets.'
Criticisms were also levelled at the government for failing to give a
sufficiently authoritative mandate to Cimpor's underwriting banks - led by
state-owned Banco Fomento e Exterior in Portugal and overseas by Baring
Brothers - to organise the issue efficiently. 'Potential investors were
being called up by 10 or 12 different banks without any co-ordination,' said
a London dealer.
This was another valuable lesson. Portugal is now counting on leading global
banks to mount efficient book-building systems and co-ordinate complex
operations over several markets.
The PT operation is an ambitious first step. One tranche, expected to raise
about Es80bn, is be sold in Portugal. An offer of American Depositary
Receipts will be made simultaneously in New York, together with an issue in
London including separate UK and international tranches.
A further 25 per cent of Cimpor originally due to be issued in New York is
now expected to be postponed. 'Cimpor would have to be offered by the first
week of March to avoid draining liquidity from the market before the PT
operation,' said an analyst in London. 'But the company is unlikely to have
its 1994 results and financial holdings sufficiently clarified to be ready
by then.'

FT  19 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Markets watch Fed and Buba - Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow, and the Bundesbank
council on Thursday, offer foreign exchanges their best possibility of
excitement in the final days of 1994.
The only other country that might provide some pre-Christmas indigestion is
Italy, where the lira remains vulnerable to further political setbacks. The
government faces possible defeat in a no-confidence vote this week.
The dollar is probably vulnerable to a decision from the Fed to keep rates
on hold into the new year. It has risen about 5.5 per cent against the
D-Mark, and 3.5 per cent against the yen, since late October.
To some extent, this appreciation has been built around the expectation of
the Fed moving aggressively to curb inflationary pressures.
Following weaker than expected inflation data last week, however,
expectations of the Fed sanctioning higher rates tomorrow have receded. Some
observers, however, believe the odds on a move are 50:50, citing evidence of
strong consumer spending as a countervailing argument.
In Germany the balance of opinion overwhelmingly favours the Bundesbank
leaving rates unchanged. Nothing, however, should be taken for granted. The
German central bank is well known for the pleasure it takes in defying
market expectations.
For the statistically minded, there is a further issue. High Frequency
Economics in New York points out that, on past evidence, December is the
most likely month for interest rates to be moved. Over the past 25 years, 10
of the 72 adjustments of official rates have been in December; nearly twice
what could be expected.
The prospect of the Berlusconi government falling in Italy has pushed the
lira to record lows recently. The confidence vote will provide markets with
more to chew on. The markets appear to have discounted most bad news, but
the lira could weaken further if a political hiatus threatens the normal
course of government.

<TEXT>
Share prices are expected to move higher this week, after the Hang Seng
index's climb through the 8,000-point level last week, writes Louise Lucas.
The index picked up 4.8 per cent last week and closed on Friday at 8,166.39,
although turnover remained thin. However, the index is unlikely to breach
8,500 because of the negative view being taken of the property market, which
claims an exposure of some 40 per cent on the index.
The sector was not encouraged by last week's withdrawal of a building plot
at auction in the face of no bids, while fears over China's spiralling
inflation have also taken a toll.
Late last week, the market took heart from gains on Wall Street, and a
belief that the US Federal Open Market Committee may not raise interest
rates tomorrow, but instead wait until the new year.
The bargain hunting and short-covering sparked by last Thursday's recovery
are likely to recur if interest rates are not lifted, although brokers
continue to warn against seeing any bounce as a convincing recovery.

<TEXT>
In a week shortened by a national holiday on Friday to mark the birthday of
Emperor Akihito, the market is awaiting today's announcement of the
government's economic growth target for the fiscal year to March 31 1996,
writes Robert Patton.
And at the same time, Mr Yasuo Matsushita, who was installed as governor of
the Bank of Japan on Saturday, will hold his first news conference. Some
analysts note that given his background, there is some speculation that Mr
Matsushita may be more inclined to assist the financial system than his
predecessor.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Finance will present a draft budget for other
ministries and agencies for the next fiscal year.

In a week largely bereft of results elsewhere, Denmark will have half-year
results today from Danisco, the food and beverages, food ingredients and
packaging conglomerate, and Radiometer, the medical measuring equipment
maker.
Daiwa Europe notes that Danish shares dropped in November for the fourth
month running, but nearly reached stability after more pronounced weakness
earlier. 'These declines, combined with an upward revision of our earnings
projects, bring Denmark into the reasonable range of multiple valuations for
1995 and 1996,' Daiwa said.

Rising interest rates and the consequent likelihood of reductions in
economic growth forecasts by the markets urge caution, says UBS.
Nevertheless, in global terms, structural and economic factors point to a
relatively good performance for Swiss equities.
UBS says its recent contacts with companies have confirmed the strong
momentum of earnings.
'Profits of the largest cyclical industrial firms will rise from SFr2.9bn in
1990 to SFr5.6bn in 1996,' it says. Aggregate profits of Swiss quoted
companies would probably grow at a double-digit rate in Swiss franc terms
this year, in 1995 and in 1996, UBS added.
The high share of profits generated in Europe and the Asia Pacific
constituted a high degree of resistance to the negative impact of any US
policy tightening, said UBS.
'The defensive character of the equity market, which amounted to a
disadvantage amid the growth euphoria of the first half of this year will
have an increasing positive impact in 1995.'

The Bundesbank council holds its last meeting of the year on Thursday, but
few analysts expect any news of a change in interest rates.
James Capel says that in spite of still weak retail sales, the strength of
third-quarter GDP data and rising capacity utilisation will mitigate against
an interest rate cut.
Capel still expects the next move in rates to be up, and the most likely
time to be the second quarter of next year. The broker notes that the
Bundesbank will also announce its monetary targets for next year, but does
not expect any change from the current 4 - 6 per cent range.
The coming week will also be a busy one for economic statistics, with data
coming on November M3, producer prices, consumer prices and October's trade
figures.

The market is bracing itself for further fireworks this week when Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, faces a confidence vote, probably on
Wednesday, that could topple him from power. The market rose above the
political fray towards the end of last week, recouping the sharp losses of
Monday and enabling the index to close flat on the week.
Dealers also reported that foreign investors were returning as buyers,
apparently heeding the advice of a growing bank of strategists that the time
is right for the market to turn after falls in recent months.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Emerging Markets: Casablanca puts itself on the map - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New share issues, privatisations, the arrival of foreign investment funds,
and the reform of the bourse's organisation have completely transformed the
Casablanca stock exchange in less than two years. As a result the stock
market has established itself as the second largest on the African
continent, excluding South Africa, with a market capitalisation of about
Dollars 5bn.
For Moroccan and foreign investors, last month's sale of the state's 66.64
per cent stake in the Societe Nationale d'Investissement marked a watershed
in the kingdom's privatisation programme.
The sale, for which Pallas Stern, a subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corporation,
acted as adviser, netted an estimated Dh2.03bn (Dollars 222m), twice the
amount raised in July 1993 when the state sold 51 per cent of the CIOR
cement company to a French subsidiary of the Swiss Holderbank group.
The increasing involvement of US, UK and French portfolio managers in the
Casablanca market reflects an improved perception of the Moroccan economy,
now that the IMF-backed adjustment of the 1980s has been completed and the
country has resumed repaying its debts after a series of rescheduling
agreements.
Over the past 12 months, some Dollars 200m of foreign money has come onto
the market, about 40 per cent of total volume, according to Mr Adil Douiri,
co-founder of Casablanca Finance Group, a financial intermediary company set
up in 1992. He expects such inflows to reach Dollars 500m next year.
According to Upline Securities, a stockbroker which alone in Morocco
provides market research in corporate finance, the total volume of foreign
investment in Morocco, including the aforementioned Dollars 200m, is set to
top Dollars 1bn this year.
Trading volume so far in 1994 has reached Dh7bn, which amounts to a 97 per
cent increase against the first 11 months of 1993. The overall share index
has shown a 30 per cent rise so far, while the CFG 25 share index has risen
by 36 per cent. However, the bourse does have some very illiquid shares,
making the market more attractive for wealthy individuals or funds than
individual investors.
The reform of the bourse, approved in September 1993, is still in the
process of being implemented, and is based on the French model. It involves
converting the market into a limited company in which the stockbrokers are
shareholders.
Its aims include better company information - up to now a very opaque area
as most companies are family owned and operated and accounts are seldom
audited by international auditing firms; more protection for investors, and
a broader range of financial instruments.
The reforms have prompted the emergence of investment funds. The largest
include the Pounds 39m Morocco Fund, jointly owned by ONA, the kingdom's
largest company, and Salomon Brothers; the Pounds 15m Interfina Fund,
jointly owned by three Moroccan banks, the International Finance Corporation
and Spains's Banco Exterior; a Dollars 30m fund set up by Framlington, a
subsidiary of Credit Commercial de France and the International Finance
Corporation; and another by Morgan Stanley Africa Investment Fund.
ONA has further contributed to the modernisation of the financial system by
a capital increase last May which took the form of the largest share issue
ever in the country, worth Dollars 120m. ONA allowed foreign investors to
buy into its capital, one third of which is now owned by Morgan Stanley,
Lehman Brothers, Paribas, BSN Danone and Assurances Generales de France.
George Soros's Quantum Emerging Growth Fund bought a 2 per cent stake, for
Dollars 40m, last April.
The reasons for the interest Morocco provokes abroad are easy to see. Mr
Pierre Lasserre who runs Finacor, the largest money broker in Paris, last
year bought a 47.5 per cent stake in Upline Securities, which has just
gained a seat on the Casablanca stock exchange. Mr Lasserre sees 'many
opportunities in Morocco' and was keen to 'back a group of energetic and
enterprising young Moroccans'.
All however is not plain sailing, as the minister for privatisation, Mr
Abderrahmane Saaidi, publicly acknowledged after the privatisation of SNI.
Demand for the shares of SNI, a holding company whose interests include
cement, drinks and the financial sector, was very strong, but the manner in
which shares was allocated has left a sour taste in the mouths of some
investors.
One fifth of all the shares on offer was floated on the Casablanca stock
exchange during the first week in November at Dh300 a share and was eight
times subscribed. This came as little surprise to bankers in Casablanca as
SNI shares were trading at Dh425 when they were suspended a few days before
the offering, but had the advantage, from the government's point of view, of
encouraging institutional investors to offer a higher price for the shares.
The authorities allowed the trading of SNI shares to resume before they had
completed the sale of the two other tranches, which went to institutional
investors. This encouraged people to borrow money and make a quick killing.
However, this reinforced critics in their view that the process of
privatisation was turning into 'something of a casino'.
Of the two institutional tranches, 35 per cent was sold to Moroccan
institutions, which cannot onsell the shares for five years, and a further
16 per cent went to Moroccan and foreign institutions. The commission which
overseas privatisation operations set the minimum price per share for the
two institutional tranches at Dh325, but successful bidders bought the
shares at Dh425.
SNI shares have since fallen back to Dh400 as many individual buyers who
bought them on borrowed money have been forced to realise their gains to pay
their creditors back. Further criticism focused on the role of the agent
bank for the sale, Banque Populaire, whose back room operations were
described by one City institution as a 'shambles of red tape'.
Faster progress in the broader aim of liberalising the management of
Morocco's financial sector is handicapped by three factors: the absence of
money and foreign exchange markets and hence the impossibility of currency
hedging and the absence of market driven interest rates, for which the IMF
has been pressing for two years.
The Banque al Maghrib, the central bank, and leading Moroccan banks are
according to observers, dragging their feet because they are comfortably set
in their old ways and fearful of change.
For decades, the unwritten contract between the central bank and the banks
was that the latter would finance large government deficits and leave the
banks to make comfortable margins on their other business. With an estimated
Dollars 500 to Dollars 600m deficit in government financing written into
next year's finance bill, the banks have good reason to continue in their
old ways.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Merger talk brings cheer for Christmas -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last Thursday afternoon it seemed that the festive season had turned
into the open season. At least, that is, as far as the merchant banks and
regional electricity stocks were concerned.
Just as the institutions and the market's big trading houses began to wind
down for the Christmas break, with no signs of the expected and traditional
year-end rally, up popped news of merger talks between S. G. Warburg and
Morgan Stanley, closely followed by news that Trafalgar House was
considering a bid for Northern Electric.
Those two pieces of news, plus widespread expectations that there could well
be other big bids in the market, dispelled much of the recent gloom in UK
equities.
With the FT-SE 100 index having fallen below 3,000 - it reached its lowest
level for five months early last week - the general consensus around the
City's trading desks now is that the market can make some progress as we
move into 1995
And in spite of the surprisingly abrupt termination of the merger talks
between Warburg and Morgan, which drove Warburg shares back to their
pre-merger talks level, there is a
much better feeling to the equity market.
Activity this week will inevitably slacken as the winding down process
really gets under way and there are no really big results scheduled outside
the utilities area.
But as a broker at one of the City's blue-blooded securities houses put it
last week, the big corporate finance departments in London's merchant banks
and stockbroking firms are being put on 'red alert' for the new year, which
many expect to bring a burst of takeover activity.
It is the utilities area of the market that strategists see as attracting
much of the corporate activity. With the government's golden shares in each
of the water stocks privatised in 1989 due to disappear at the end of this
month and those of the electricity companies, privatised in 1990, due to
expire
at the end of March 1995, the two sectors are the market's prime candidates
to attract the attentions of predators.
Analysts have long suggested that the powerful US utility companies have
been eyeing the cash generative electricity companies. Strategic mergers
among various water and electricity stocks are also said to be on the
cards.
There are, however, two not-insignificant hurdles for the market to
negotiate this week; Tuesday's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
meeting, which will ponder US monetary policy, and Thursday's Bundesbank
Council meeting. The markets are betting on both institutions leaving their
interest rates unchanged. But you never know.

FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Chances look better for a holiday rally -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Federal Reserve last raised interest rates in November the
market has zig-zagged as investors tried to guess whether the it would raise
rates again in December. This week they should produce an answer after the
Fed's open market committee meeting holds its final meeting of the year
tomorrow.
It was not until the central bank boosted interest rates by 75 basis points
on November 15 that the market woke up to the reality that the Fed chairman,
Mr Alan Greenspan, meant business when he promised to wring inflationary
pressures out of the economy.
The following week, stocks took a nose-dive as strong economic data
suggested to market players that earnings might be battered by another rate
increase by the year-end. Also that week, the yield curve representing the
spread between two-year notes and the long bond began to flatten, indicating
that bond market players expected an economic slowdown.
Last week, however, sentiment began to shift as relatively tame increases in
consumer and producer price indices suggested that the Fed might wait to see
the full effects of this year's six increases before undertaking more
tightening. The yield curve, which had tightened to 13 basis points, spread
back out to 28 points by the end of the week and the Dow recovered 3 per
cent of its value.
Stocks typically get a boost at the end of the year, but until last week
analysts were sceptical about whether the market could stage its traditional
holiday rally.
Now investors will be watching to see if the market's recovery was due to
fundamental changes in sentiment or technical factors surrounding last
Friday's 'triple-witching hour', when options and futures on stock indices
expired together in 60 minutes of trading.
Mr David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, believes it
was a bit of both. 'The consumer and producer price data were good and we
got put into overdrive by options,' he says.
Data on November durable goods orders due out on Friday should give
investors an indication of Fed policy for the coming year, but reaction may
be muted as Friday is the last day of trading before Christmas and volumes
are expected to be low. A consensus of economists expects orders to increase
by about 1.4 per cent after a 1.0 per cent decrease in October.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department will release its final GDP figure for
the third quarter, but the number is not expected to have much of an effect
as investors have already seen two preliminary figures. At the end of
November, third-quarter GDP growth was estimated to be 3.9 per cent, and
analysts do not expect any significant change.

FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: 'Death cross' looms for gold - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seasonal spirit among the world's gold traders could be dampened this week
by what an analyst describes as an 'arithmetical sword of Damocles' hanging
over their market.
Mr Andy Smith, of the Union Bank of Switzerland, warns that the market needs
to rally soon to avoid being caught in a 'death cross', which, according to
technical theory, could signal a sharp price fall.
This would occur, he says, if the 200-day moving average was crossed by the
50-day moving average while both were falling.
A similar situation in the silver market in late November augured a sudden
15 per cent fall in that market.
In New York, meanwhile, most gold analysts are expecting the market to
remain dull next year, though they say an improving supply-and-demand
outlook should sustain the modest firming trend of the past two years.
'The market has been in a better balance this year, and we are looking for
growing supply deficits in the years to come,' Mr George Milling-Stanley,
Lehman Brothers analyst, told the Reuters news agency last week. 'This
scenario should be supportive of gradually rising prices.'
Throughout 1994, the spot price of gold languished within a thin Dollars 30
band from Dollars 368 to Dollars 398 an ounce, far narrower than 1993's
Dollars 80 range.
De Beers, the South African group whose London-based Central Selling
Organisation accounts for at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough
(uncut) diamonds, on Tuesday gives details of CSO diamond sales this year.
Although it had record first half sales of Dollars 2.58bn, analysts suggest
that the CSO eased back sales in the second half, so the 1994 total is not
expected to be very different from last year's Dollars 4.366bn.
Today marks the formal opening of the London Metal Exchange's new
headquarters and trading ring at which Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK Chancellor of
the Exchequer, will do the honours.

FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: A world without Treasury bonds - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Next month, America's newly triumphant Republicans will seek to amend the US
constitution to make it illegal for the government to borrow money. The
permanently balanced budget is an old dream of the right in more countries
than the US, and few give this latest attempt even a fighting chance. But
these are strange times, and it pays to allow for contingencies. From an
investor's point of view, what would a world without Treasury bonds actually
look like?
To begin with, it would not happen all at once. The Republicans' plans are
still imprecise, but the general notion seems to be a steady reduction of
the budget deficit to zero over the next decade or so. Further borrowing
would then be outlawed, and any occasional surpluses would be used to pay
off the backlog. This would presumably take several decades again.
At present, the total of US Treasury bonds outstanding is about Dollars
3,500bn. Annual issuance, net of redemptions, is about Dollars 175bn. These
numbers, big as they are, need to be put in context. US Treasuries are the
classic international investment, and global savings run at about Dollars
3,000bn a year. The annual supply of T-bonds, in fact, soaks up only a small
part of the cash looking for a home.
All the same, Dollars 3,500bn is a lot of money. If T-bonds did disappear,
the market would require them to be replaced by some other instrument as
like them as possible. A number of financial institutions have long-term
cash liabilities which they need to match with long-term, fixed-rate assets.
The obvious candidates to fill the gap are corporations. At present, most
companies use equity and bank finance more often than they would like;
logically, fixed-rate bonds would make their long-range planning a lot
simpler. But they tend to be crowded out by governments, which can command
lower yields. Take the government out of the equation, and the yields on
corporate bonds would decline to the level at which long-term savers could
persuade corporate borrowers to provide an alternative home for their money.
Much of this would presumably represent new capital for companies, rather
than a replacement for old. After all, investors would still demand equities
as before, and banks would still need to lend. As Mr John Lipsky, Salomon's
chief economist, suggests, the result would be a sharp rise in capital
expenditure by corporations, accompanied by a lowering of their required
rates of return on investment to reflect the changed cost of capital.
The resulting investment landscape might look familiar to the historian of
the late 19th century. Mr David Hale of Kemper Financial points out that in
the decades following the Civil War, the US government punctiliously repaid
its borrowings. By the 1890s there was no US public debt left: so British
savers, for instance, had to resort to financing US railroads and factories
instead, with sometimes patchy results.
How corporations would spend their money this time round is an open
question. It seems fair to assume, though, that faced with an abundance of
capital, they would continue to substitute capital for labour. There have
been huge advances in manufacturing productivity in recent years. Much
remains to be done in the service sector.
The next obvious question is how many of the people whose labour is replaced
can be usefully re-employed. At this point, what might otherwise seem a
wholly benign process turns potentially ugly.
One need not be a Republican hawk to concede that for global savings to be
allocated by Adam Smith's invisible hand, rather than by civil servants, is
likely to improve economic efficiency. But corporations are not in the
business of providing safety nets. What happens if the invisible hand throws
people out of work, while at the same time civil servants are deprived of
the funds to help the unemployed?
There are other pressures in the same direction. As Mr Lipsky argues,
governments - take Italy as an example - will eventually have to face the
fact that their unfunded liabilities in pensions and other benefits
represent an unsustainable burden on future generations.
The obvious answer is to privatise those liabilities, so that people take
upon themselves the whole responsibility for their pensions or healthcare.
The result of that would be a sharp rise in personal savings and a
corresponding drop in government borrowing.
Mr Hale takes the argument a step further. The whole idea of balancing the
budget through a constitutional amendment, he argues, has a sub-plot. One of
the biggest burdens on the Federal budget is the vast panoply of tax breaks
and subsidies enjoyed by middle class America.
Give the balanced budget constitutional teeth, says Mr Hale, and you have
the means to enforce the revolutionary next step: the means testing of
social security. Here again, the result is the same: higher saving, less
government spending and more money for investment by the corporate sector.
If America moved any distance in this direction, it would not move alone.
The natural result of a systemic shift of funds away from government towards
corporate investment would be higher productivity and increased
competitiveness. In a world of weakening trade barriers, this
competitiveness would translate into pressure on America's trading partners
to follow suit.
One need not regard the objectives of the Republican right as plausible, or
even desirable, to find the trends they represent thought-provoking. Even a
move in the direction of a balanced budget, after all, would have sizeable
implications. One final investment tip from Mr Hale; three-quarters of the
business on the Chicago futures exchanges is in Treasury bond futures. So if
you think the Republicans are going to have their wicked way, go short of
seats on the Chicago Board of Trade.

FT  19 DEC 94 / The Markets: Confronting the old age crisis - Economic Eye
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you expect future generations to pay you a good pension over decades of
secure retirement? Do you also believe in Father Christmas?
In no area of public policy is there a greater need for clear-sighted
policy-making, since decisions taken today will have effects half a century
or more in the future. But be warned. Nowhere is there a greater temptation
for governments (and employers) to make deceitful promises for short-term
advantage.
In the UK, the government has just announced a bill to make occupational
pensions safer, but has failed to address the conflicts of interest inherent
in defined-benefit occupational pension schemes. In the US, a bi-partisan
commission has failed to agree on how to contain the burgeoning cost of
entitlement programmes. In Italy, the fiscal programme of Mr Silvio
Berlusconi has been undermined by the constitutional court's insistence that
it pay arrears on certain pensions, going back to 1983.
As a superb, but under-reported World Bank study, published earlier this
autumn, shows, all these are but different aspects of the world's rapid
ageing.* Nor is this mainly a problem for industrial countries. The number
of people over 60 is forecast to rise from half a billion in 1990 to 1.4bn
by 2030. Some 29 per cent of that increase is to be in China alone; another
29 per cent in the rest of Asia; and 28 per cent in other developing and
transitional countries. Only 14 per cent will be in industrial countries.
The burden of public pensions is set to rise sharply (as is shown in the
chart, on the assumption that the current relationship between demography
and spending on pensions continues). Today the Italian state is tottering
under the burden of paying just over 14 per cent of gross domestic product
in pensions, but the average burden of industrial countries is set to be
higher than this by 2030. The increased costs will be still more difficult
to bear in poor developing countries, such as China. Health spending is also
correlated with ageing: in Australia, for example, public health spending
per head on people over 65 is six times that on children under 15.
Ageing is, in fact, the world's most important economic challenge. Pension
and health spending on the old either is already - or will become - the
largest item of public spending virtually everywhere: in Austria and Sweden,
it is already close to 20 per cent of GDP. In OECD countries, implicit
pension debt exceeds reported public debt by large amounts: in the UK, for
example, the ratio of public debt to GDP in 1990 was 35 per cent, while the
implicit pension debt was over 150 per cent of GDP. Italian implicit pension
debt was almost 250 per cent of GDP, dwarfing the explicit debt ratio of
over 100 per cent.
Ageing is important for equality between the sexes, since women are much
more likely to be old and poor than men. Meanwhile, heavy payroll taxes,
largely to cover pensions, represent an important cause of high levels of
unemployment, notably in Europe. In the UK, for example, the payroll tax
rate was close to 20 per cent in 1990. In Poland, it was 30 per cent.
Pension systems also have implications for savings, while private pension
funds have become massive players in capital markets. In 1991, pension fund
assets were two thirds of GDP in the US, 70 per cent in Switzerland, 73 per
cent in the UK and 76 per cent in the Netherlands.
If any area of public policy requires long-term planning, it is pensions.
Unfortunately, governments have set up public pension schemes that generated
hugely positive real returns to the first cohorts of beneficiaries, but
negative real returns as they mature. In the case of the US, for example,
the real return to those retiring 25 years after the establishment of social
security was 9 per cent, but this fell to below 4 per cent for those
retiring 45 years after. Things will get still worse in the future. One
indication of this is the increases in taxes as a share of GDP that will be
needed to meet pay-as-you-go pension obligations. In Italy, the worst
example, the required tax increase will be 11.9 per cent of GDP.
Governments are absolutely certain to default on their pension obligations,
probably by a mixture of higher pension ages, reduced indexation and means
testing. The notion that the state can be trusted is just one of several
myths punctured by the Bank. It also notes that the anti-poverty case for
focusing aid on the old is weak, because families with small children are
usually poorest of all; that social security for the old rarely
redistributes income to the poor, partly because the rich live longer; and
that governments focus quite as much on the short term as individuals, one
example being the use of early retirement programmes as a false cure for
unemployment, another being how pay-as-you-go programmes concentrated
benefits on voters who were mature at the time they were established.
The Bank study argues that there should be three distinct policy objectives:
redistribution to the poor; smoothing of consumption; and provision of
insurance. It also recommends a multi-pillar system, with the public pillar
providing a basic minimum income, to alleviate poverty in old age and insure
citizens against a multitude of risks. But relying on the public sector
alone is risky. Thus, it also recommends a privately-managed, funded and
mandatory system, alongside purely voluntary savings.
It is impossible to do justice to this rich study in one article. But it has
a clear lesson: stop believing in Father Christmas and start saving now.

Nine West, the US footwear group that made a Dollars 425m unwanted bid
approach for US Shoe's footwear business earlier this year, said it had won
agreement to buy the division for Dollars 600m.
The claim was made after the stock market closed on Friday. US Shoe
confirmed that it had conducted confidential discussions with Nine West, but
denied that an agreement had been reached.
US Shoe is a specialty retailer of women's clothing, optical goods and
footwear with sales of about Dollars 2.7bn.
Nine West, a rival of US Shoe, designs and sells women's fashion shoes and
has annual sales of about Dollars 550m.
On Friday, Nine West said it was offering Dollars 600m in cash for US Shoe's
footwear business plus warrants to purchase 1.85m Nine West shares at an
exercise price of Dollars 35.50 a share.

FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Burlington raises bid for Santa
Fe

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The stakes in the contested bid for the Santa Fe Pacific railroad were
raised yesterday with an increased offer from Burlington Northern valuing
Santa Fe at Dollars 3.8bn in cash and shares.
The bid is a sharp increase on the offer from rival railroad company Union
Pacific of around Dollars 3.2bn in cash and shares.
Burlington and Santa Fe said they would both make cash tenders for Santa Fe
stock, amounting to around a third of the equity, at Dollars 20 a share.
Thereafter Burlington would offer a stock swap for the remainder of Santa
Fe's equity. Whereas the cash element of the transaction would take place
next month, the stock swap would not take place until government approval of
the merger.
The offer from Union Pacific, although lower, has the advantage of having
been provisionally cleared by the authorities. Its offer is allowed to
proceed immediately, with Santa Fe's shares being placed in an independent
trust pending official clearance.
Santa Fe also said its agreed deal with Burlington involved a poison pill
payment to Burlington of up to Dollars 60m if the agreement fell through.
Santa Fe said it would repay Dollars 400m of its outstanding debt.

Nine West, the US footwear group that made a Dollars 425m unwanted bid
approach for US Shoe's footwear business earlier this year, said it had won
agreement to buy the division for Dollars 600m.
The claim was made after the stock market closed on Friday. US Shoe
confirmed that it had conducted confidential discussions with Nine West, but
denied that an agreement had been reached.
US Shoe is a specialty retailer of women's clothing, optical goods and
footwear with about 2,200 stores and annual sales of about Dollars 2.7bn.
Its lacklustre earnings record has put it under pressure to improve its
performance.
Nine West, a rival of US Shoe, designs and sells women's fashion shoes and
has annual sales of about Dollars 550m.
It first approached US Shoe in July with a proposal that US Shoe should spin
off its clothing and optical businesses and merge its footwear business with
Nine West's. However, US Shoe's board rejected the idea.
Soon afterwards, Nine West publicised details of the approach in what
appeared to be an attempt to generate support for the plan from US Shoe's
shareholders, so putting pressure on the company's board to reconsider.
On Friday, Nine West said it was offering Dollars 600m in cash for US Shoe's
footwear business plus warrants to purchase 1.85m Nine West shares at an
exercise price of Dollars 35.50 a share. The warrants would have a term of
seven years and one warrant would be issued for every 25 issued US Shoe
shares.
Mr Vincent Camuto, co-chairman and president of Nine West, said US Shoe
would provide a 'terrific' fit and the acquisition would benefit Nine West
shareholders from the outset.
US Shoe said it would not make any further comments on the negotiations
until such time as a definitive agreement had been reached.

FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Poslums lose control of Dylex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Poslum family has finally lost control of Dylex, the financially
troubled Canadian fashion chain. River Road (Canada), the Canadian arm of
the US investment fund, becomes Dylex's biggest investor with about 13 per
cent of the stock on a fully diluted basis.
The Dylex board decided last week to omit dividends on the A stock for the
eighth consecutive quarter. Under the company's by-laws this automatically
gave the vote to 69m A shares outstanding, far outweighing the Poslum
family's control though the voting B shares.
River Road holds 5m A shares and also convertible debentures. Assuming
conversion it would hold a 13% voting interest against the family's 6 per
cent.
The board will have a majority of outside directors after being reduced in
number from 18 to 12, including two River Road representatives. River Road
had fought for omitting dividends, saying Dylex could not afford any
pay-out.
Mr Robert Poile, a River Road managing partner who will become a director,
said: 'Dylex is open to takeover but we want to get it functioning properly
and realising its potential.'
Dylex reported a third-quarter net loss of CDollars 110m (USDollars 79.1m)
or CDollars 1.55 a share, including CDollars 116m of special charges,
against a loss of CDollars 2.5m or 4 cents a year ago. Sales fell 2 per cent
to CDollars 436m.
The nine-month loss was CDollars 132m or CDollars 1.87 a share, against a
loss of CDollars 9.5m or 16 cents on sales of CDollars 1.2bn against
CDollars 1.3bn.
Dylex A shares have fallen from a 1989 high of CDollars 12 to 61 cents
because of heavy losses from over-expansion and the long recession. The
Posluns came under strong criticism for their operating policies.
'The fundamentals and a weak balance sheet have forced their hands as much
as River Road,' said Mr David Brodie, analyst with Wood Gundy.
River Road's parent is Paloma Group, a large US investment fund.

FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Galerias seeks protection
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Galerias Preciados, Spain's second biggest department store chain which was
formerly owned by the UK's Mountleigh property group, applied for protection
from its creditors over the weekend, citing liabilities of Pta64.3bn
(Dollars 491m).
A decision to place Galerias in receivership would be likely to lead to its
break-up and the dispersal of the chain's 29-strong nationwide network of
prime site stores, five of them in Madrid, among domestic and foreign
buyers.
Marks &amp; Spencer of the UK, which already operates five stores in Spain and
plans to open a further 10, said last month that it was in talks with
Galerias with a view to taking over some of its properties.
Among the retail chain's chief creditors are suppliers, which are owed some
Pta28bn, and its chief financial backers, Lloyds Bank, Citibank and
Barclays, which are understood to be calling in bank loans totalling an
estimated Pta18bn.
Galerias, which has more than 7,000 employees, was acquired from Mountleigh
by a group of Spanish investors for Pta21.2bn two years ago.
This year, the company's turnover is forecast to drop from Pta80bn to
Pta72bn and its losses are likely to be in the region of Pta10bn.
Weakened by a succession of owners in the past 15 years, Galerias was part
of the controversial Rumasa private holding of financier Jose Maria Ruiz
Mateos between 1981 and 1983. It was bought by Venezuela's Cisneros group in
1984 after the government expropriated Rumasa to avert the holding's
bankruptcy and sold it to Mountleigh in 1987 for Pta30bn.

   US companies are flush with cash

and some are finding more ways to return it to their shareholders.
On Friday, General Electric said it would buy Dollars 5bn worth of its
shares in the market over the next two years. That took to a record Dollars
65bn the value of stock buy-backs announced so far this year, topping the
Dollars 62bn reached in 1989, according to Securities Data.
Does this mean, as US chief executives have been saying, that shares are
cheap? Or is it a signal that the US stock market is past its prime, and due
for a further correction?
This year's buy-backs are, first and foremost, a sign of the strength of US
corporate cashflow. The last big wave of buy-backs came at the end of the
1980s, before the US recession. Now, after the faltering early years of the
recovery, the US economy has surged and a bigger flow of cash into corporate
coffers has been one result.
Some companies have given up this cash willingly, while others have been
strong-armed by shareholders into unlocking their war-chests. Chrysler was
pressured by its biggest shareholder, Mr Kirk Kerkorian, into announcing a
Dollars 1bn buy-back at the end of November. And the biggest programme of
the year - a Dollars 6bn plan by Philip Morris announced in August - came
after a management upheaval prompted by shareholder dissatisfaction.
Many companies are combining buy-backs with higher dividends to distribute
their surplus cash. Chrysler's 60 per cent dividend rise lifted the yield on
its stock from a meagre 2 per cent or so to over 3 per cent, ahead of the
market average. GE's announcement also included a 14 per cent dividend
increase, the latest in a long string of higher cash pay-outs by the
industrial giant.
In spite of announcements such as these, the overall dividend yield on the
broad-based S&amp;P index of US companies remains below 3 per cent. 'Dividends
are generally below traditional levels,' says Mr Byron Wien, a strategist at
Morgan Stanley in New York. There is still room for some big dividend
increases as 'some companies continue to catch up', he says.
To the companies buying in their shares, the rational is simple: they are
cheap. 'GE stock today makes the best investment we can make,' Mr Jack
Welch, GE chief executive, said on Friday.
This is in part just another version of the standard rhetoric of company
bosses: that the stock market does not value their shares highly enough. But
it also indicates that companies such as GE have reviewed all the ways of
using their cash - through higher capital investment or buying other
companies, for instance - and decided that none offers a better alternative.
That suggests a cautious view of future growth following the series of US
interest rate rises this year.
One result could be a further slowdown in the takeover market, which has
been cooling since a surge of activity over the spring and summer. GE itself
had planned to use more than Dollars 2bn of cash to buy Kemper, a financial
services group, this year - but it has shown no sign of returning to the
fray now that a rival bid for Kemper has collapsed (although GE says it
could easily suspend its buy-back programme to make acquisitions).
Many of the buy-backs are direct responses to slowing earnings growth. The
banking sector remains the clearest example. Replete with capital and facing
modest revenue growth at best, many banks have embarked on share repurchases
to maintain double-digit growth in earnings a share - reducing the number of
shares outstanding is the most direct route available to a company to do
this.
Are companies simply looking for ways to support their share prices as the
surge in profits passes? Most US analysts predict that the earnings cycle is
not over yet, and that 1995 profits will mark a further steady rise from
this year.
But after the round of interest rate increases and the chance of another,
perhaps as early as tomorrow, the prospects for 1996 are getting hazy. That
weakens one of the underpinnings for share prices at their current levels -
whatever companies do to buy in their own stock.

shares
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the state-controlled French
insurance company, might put on the market next year shares in Credit
Industriel et Commercial worth around FFr1bn, writes David Buchan in Paris.
The capital injection is to take the form of a transfer to GAN of the
state's 7.1 per cent stake in the bank, in which GAN already holds 85.5 per
cent. GAN said it needed the extra capital following its FFr846m loss in the
first half of this year because of heavy damage insurance claims, poor
returns on property investments and lower bond values.
The move will raise GAN's stake in CIC to 92.6 per cent, giving it also all
the voting rights in the bank.

FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rolo board accepts Cariplo bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna-based commercial bank,
has accepted the L3,300bn (Dollars 2bn) overture from its new suitor, the
consortium led by Cariplo, Italy's biggest savings bank.
Board approval following weekend meetings was widely expected following the
Cariplo consortium's unexpectedly generous offer last week. The consortium
offered L21,500 per share for 70 per cent of Rolo's stock.
This was not only L1,500 more per share than the improved offer made by the
recently privatised Credito Italiano (Credit) but also extended to 70 per
cent of the shares instead of the 63.6 per cent proposed to shareholders by
Credit.
Rolo declined to comment formally on the meeting; but the board was
apparently unanimous in deciding that the Cariplo offer was more
advantageous.
The Credit bid, first launched in October, has always been regarded by the
bulk of the board as hostile.
The Cariplo bid was first mounted in conjunction with Carisbo, the main
savings institution in Emilia Romagna and IMI, the treasury-controlled bank.
But this trio has now been joined by Reale Mutua, the insurance group.
The next step will be for the Bank of Italy to pronounce upon the
counter-offer, having already given the green light to Credit. The Bank of
Italy is likely to have already been sounded out informally, not least
because behind-the-scenes discussions between Rolo and Milan-based Cariplo
have taken place at intervals for much of the year.
The Bank of Italy may not be entirely happy at the prospect of Rolo, one of
the healthiest private commercial banks, being controlled by banking
institutions which have yet to be privatised. But this is unlikely to halt
the deal.
Only when approval has been given can the counter-bid be formalised. Given
the Christmas break, this could mean a delay until the second week in
January. The main imponderable now is whether Credit will accept defeat
without a further fight.
Credit's bid would cost the bank L2,800bn and most analysts have ruled out
its raising the stakes without help. Over the weekend there were press
reports that Credit might be enlisting the support of Allianz, its leading
German shareholder, as well as Banca Commerciale Italiano.

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berisford in talks for US purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International, the former property and commodities group which
earlier this year bought Magnet kitchens, is in negotiations which could
lead to the acquisition of a US kitchen equipment maker for about Dollars
500m (Pounds 305m).
While talks could be concluded this week, Berisford has yet to agree terms
with Welbilt Corporation, which manufactures commercial kitchen equipment
for fast food chains such as McDonalds and Burger King.
If the deal goes ahead, Berisford will finance the deal through a rights
issue.
On December 6, Welbilt said that it had received an approach which could
lead to the sale of the company and had appointed Donaldson Lufkin Jenrett,
the US investment bank, as adviser.
Welbilt is 47 per cent owned by Mr Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out company. A secondary offering of
shares held by Mr Kohlberg was withdrawn when Berisford made its approach.
In 1993 Welbilt's net income before extraordinary charges was Dollars 9m on
turnover of Dollars 426m.
The acquisition would allow Berisford to utilise some of its accumulated US
tax losses arising from activities in commercial property in the 1980s.
The deal would be Berisford's second large acquisition since Mr Alan Bowkett
took over as chief executive in 1992. In January it paid Pounds 56m for
Magnet, also financed through a rights issue.
Last year, its Pounds 180m bid for C&amp;J Clark, the privately owned shoe
company, was rejected.

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Rebel shareholders reject QMH proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rebel shareholders at Queens Moat Houses yesterday rejected a Pounds 1.3bn
rescue plan for the debt-burdened hotels group, claiming it was unfair to
existing investors.
The Queens Moat Houses Shareholders Action Group, which claims to represent
4,000 investors controlling 10 per cent of the equity, said the plan -
involving a Pounds 200m debt for equity swap and revised borrowing terms -
was 'quite unacceptable'.
Mr Denis Woodhams, secretary of the group, said holders of ordinary shares
were dismayed by moves to dilute their interests from 81 per cent of the
company to 24 per cent.
'These proposals are a manifestation of the board's lack of confidence in
its own ability to produce even an industry average profit performance,' he
added.
The dissident group has proposed an alternative rescue rights issue drawn up
by Mr Peter Eyles, former managing director of Norfolk Capital Group, the
luxury hotel company acquired by Queens Moat in 1990.
It is likely, however, to encounter strong opposition from the Queens Moat
board.
Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, warned last week that the group would
have to cease trading if it failed to take up the debt-for-equity and
financial reconstruction proposals.
Claims, meanwhile, that the rebel group would receive widespread support at
this week's annual meeting have been rejected by the company. 'The
institutions were canvassed in advance of our (reconstruction) scheme and
are supportive of it,' Queens Moat said.
The company also questioned the number of shares controlled by the action
group, adding that it would not have an opportunity to challenge the rescue
plan until an extraordinary meeting was called in the new year.
Nevertheless, a solicitor acting for Mr John Bairstow, Queens Moat's former
chairman, is expected to seek an adjournment of Wednesday's annual meeting.
Mr Alan Reed, who manages several shareholding trusts, wants the re-election
of directors delayed until shareholders have considered the refinancing
proposals.
The company dismissed such action as 'nuisance making'.

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank lifts stake in motor insurance
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland increased by Pounds 5m its investment in a new
motor insurance company set up with Mr Peter Wood of Direct Line after
discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry, the bank's annual
report revealed on Friday.
The bank announced last year that it intended to invest Pounds 24m in
Privilege, which is aimed at 'non-standard' risk drivers, but it increased
its stake to Pounds 29m in May after talks with the DTI, which is
responsible for regulating the insurance industry.
Privilege began trading in the autumn.
Royal Bank of Scotland's decision increased the preference shares it owns in
Privilege to 27.5m from 22.5m. The bank also owns 1.5m ordinary shares and
Mr Wood owns a further 1m.

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Poll taken at Wellcome AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A revolt by small shareholders at Wellcome's annual meeting forced the
company to hold a poll on a special resolution.
The results of the poll showed a big majority in favour of the resolution,
thanks to the weight of institutional shareholdings.
The shareholders rebelled against a plan to renew the company's right to
issue new shares - up to 5 per cent of the issued capital - for cash,
without offering all shareholders the opportunity to avoid dilution by
buying some of the newly issued stock.
Such resolutions are not uncommon. They allow management some flexibility in
corporate deals, for example to offer shares to a prospective business
partner.
Two shareholders spoke against the motion and enough voted against it to
make it unclear whether the required 75 per cent majority had been secured.
A poll resulted in a 99.37 per cent vote in favour.

leaves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oceonics Group, the lossmaking marine survey company, announced the
departure of its finance director and cuts in executive salaries after
sliding into the red with losses of Pounds 1.69m in the half year to
September 30.
It said Mr Mike Hutchison would be leaving the group at the end of the
current financial year, in which it has cut 131 jobs - 20 per cent of the
workforce - amid weak demand and over-capacity in the offshore oil industry.
The company said Mr David Arnold, the newly appointed group commercial
director, would take over as finance director from Mr Hutchison. The costs
associated with Mr Arnold's appointment were being matched with voluntary
cuts in director compensation.
The loss, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 222,000 last time, was on
turnover down from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 8.19m. Losses per share were 1.2p
(0.2p).

In a year of 'consolidation and change', Haemocell, the USM-quoted medical
equipment maker, incurred increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.35m against
Pounds 2.13m for the 12 months to August 31.
The primary task, according to Mr Andrew Priestly, chairman, had been to
restructure operations and establish an international sales and distribution
network.
Turnover was Pounds 212,000, compared with Pounds 1.12m which included an
exclusive distributor's inventory, most of which was repurchased or returned
as part of the termination agreement.
The company's priority remained to market its System 350 blood transfusion
device, Mr Priestly said.
Losses per share were 10.9p (10.1p).

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Phoenix recovers to Pounds 173,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Phoenix Timber Group swung back into the black at the midterm stage as the
Essex-based flooring company built upon the improvement shown in last year's
second half.
Turnover from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 8.58m (Pounds 8.33m)
in the six months to September 30, including Pounds 54,000 from
acquisitions. After a reduced interest burden, pre-tax profits were Pounds
173,000, against losses of Pounds 525,000.
The company stressed, however, that the improvement mainly reflected cost
cutting; the market for its main operations remains weak, although trading
in the last three months has shown some 'encouraging signs'.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.55p, against losses of 1.94p.

FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Last ditch efforts at Stanhope -
Receivership looms unless a deal can be agreed with its lenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With less than 24 hours to go before its banking facilities expire,
Stanhope, the property developer run by Mr Stuart Lipton, was last night
making last ditch efforts to stave off receivership.
Since the last formal meeting of Stanhope's 16 lenders last Tuesday,
intensive discussions have taken place between the company, its banks and
potential rescuers.
The banks, led by Barclays, must either extend their Pounds 140m loans
beyond today's repayment deadline or force the company into receiver-ship.
The two main rescue proposals have come from Postel, the post and
telecommunications pension fund run by Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, and British
Land, the property investment company headed by Mr John Ritblat.
While both rescue packages have been refined to offer Stanhope's lenders
better terms, the banks would still have to write off up to 20p in the pound
on their loans.
Alternatively, Stanhope believes it has found an investor willing to provide
working capital in return for an equity stake in the company, if the banks
agree to a debt standstill of up to three years.
The company hopes that the value of its main asset - a 50 per cent stake in
Broadgate Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate
developments in the City of London - would rise sufficiently during the
standstill period to give the banks full repayment.
However, the banking syndicate has been unable to agree on a course of
action. Some of Stanhope's banks also made loans to Broadgate Properties and
Rosehaugh, which owns the other half of Broadgate and is already in
receivership.
KPMG Peat Marwick would be favourite to be appointed receiver at Stanhope.
It already acts for the banks at Rosehaugh and could therefore handle the
disposal of Broadgate Properties as a single entity.
